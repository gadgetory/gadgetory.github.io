now is a quick look at the state of the
smartphone industry we're about halfway
through the summer and we're expecting
some big releases from Samsung and LG
followed up by some smartphone fall
releases from Apple and Google but
looking over the sales data over the
last couple of months we're curious
where you think we'll see the fiercest
competition the United States seems to
be a pretty well matured market looking
at sales data up until the month of May
Apple at 44% Samsung at 29% LG at 10%
moto at 4 and HTC is - that only leaves
11% of the market for other that's not a
lot of room for another manufacturer to
climb into this space and try and act as
a market disruptor especially when only
two players in this market represent
over 70% of consumer sales this is also
coming on the heels of some really
exciting news that smartphone
penetration in the United States has
topped 80% the smartphone has become one
of those ubiquitous gadgets we all need
to have one one of the only consumer
electronics more popular is the
television which has been holding steady
at 96% of American homes but to contrast
that the world market is a lot more
volatile especially as India and China
are starting to flex their economic
muscle here we see the top two players
flip with Samsung at 23% of the
worldwide market in Apple only at 19% we
recently covered on PocketNow where they
do seem to be slipping in China it's
Huawei who jumps into third at 10% Oppo
follows at 7% vivo at 5% and the rest of
the smartphone players around the world
have 39 percent of the market to play
with these numbers make a lot of sense
as we've seen a number of markets around
the world start firing of LTE and the
consumers in those areas are often
searching for more cost-effective mobile
computing solutions though these North
American sales numbers do come with a
little concern manufacturers examining
their options and looking for the best
possible return on their investments
might look at the United States as a
no-go consumers here are pretty well
entrenched with the brands that they're
loyal to so no one's expecting an
overnight success a smartphone that can
launch here and instantly eclipse the
galaxy or the iPhone but even cracking
into the top five is going to take a
substantial amount of marketing
advertising boots on the ground and
support when companies like LG moto and
HTC are struggling to crack into
double-digit sales territory it's not
exactly a rosy outlook for a new player
and that's
not exactly great news for us consumers
as we know what happens to markets when
they're overly dominated by only one or
two main players to see continued
progress and for us to continue getting
the best of the best competition is key
as it's only competition which will
force market leaders to continue
improving their products Apple and
Samsung are doing a very good job of
fighting each other but we're always
happy to see another player come in to
act as a market disruptor the smartphone
has handily won this generation of
consumer electronics but we want to hear
from you do these sales numbers indicate
a plateaued market waning interest in
buying a new smartphone but does this
mean there's an opportunity for another
player to walk into this market and
really shake things up or are we
approaching the post smartphone era
we're currently in the post PC era
people still have computers they're just
not necessarily the most exciting
gadgets we we go out to shop for that's
the really big question for me is how
can a player really step up and compete
in a market that's media dominated by
two manufacturers I don't know we'll
probably look back on a video like this
five years from now and think
smartphones how quaint

implants as always thanks so much for
