every single time the media goes crazy
over every hot new device and after that
review period wears off so does the buzz
behind that new toy you might still want
to buy but that now faces new
competition in the real world things
shouldn't be that way
for most of us aging is just as
important as the moment you unbox your
product for the first time it's how that
device performs after extensive use that
really matters down the line so let's do
something about it let's take a second
look at one of the best-selling
smartphones of the year at its first
inflection point ever I'm high memory
that I would pocket now and this is
iPhone 6s after the buzz
for nearly six consecutive years an
iPhone has always been one of my two
phones I carry the nun lied serves a
purpose for me as it allows the bulkier
Android phone to blend better with the
thinner iPhone in my pocket in the past
the Android would be my secondary phone
I would carry but for the first time
ever in 2016 the iPhone has actually
been relegated to that title and there
are a ton of reasons for that
I can't say that it has anything to do
with hardware if anything this iPhone is
probably one of the sturdiest phones
I've had to falls into tile and concrete
have left some scuffs on the Border's
but I was expecting a lot more damaged
after I picked it up proving that the
7000 series aluminium is quite strong
these falls actually compelled me to buy
the Apple leather case which may not
have aged gracefully after months of use
but that's the best job I've seen in not
permanently smudging the aluminum with
lint marks the display hasn't really
aged too well though scratches are very
evident and I stand by my theory that
Apple's oleophobic coating wears off
after three months of use making the
phone a horrible smudge magnet and then
there's the case of this IPS LCD display
that's very good in accuracy but clearly
dated by competitors and things like
colour reproduction of blacks and
viewing angles from the bottom thinks
that just shouldn't exist on a phone
this expensive
in the software Department Iowa's has
also been a mixed bag of the same and
the different the major selling point
for the iPhone success was 3d touch
adding quick shortcuts through a pink
when soft pressed and through a pop when
hard pressed the tactic engine built
within even contributes the tactile
feedback when you do making the feature
cool to call upon every now and then the
problem is that after months of using
the iPhone success I'm not ashamed to
say that I barely use it the
inconsistency of applications that
support it is really annoying and that
includes apple's native applications and
then there's the slow adoption rate by
third-party developers but to make
matters less enticing my biggest
complaint over time is the fact that I
really can't customize this feature if I
can't really set my own shortcuts it
kind of defeats the purpose instead of
giving me for arbitrary options when
peeking through the camera application
that I don't really care about I'd love
to be able to edit these at my own
choice a lot of these complaints of 3d
touch are actually addressed with iOS 10
hence the reason why my primary driver
is currently running the beta
applications that are already enhanced
now provide a very useful preview into
the widgets of the application these are
still not user customizable but do
provide a compelling reason to remember
that 3d touches they're now gimmicks
aside using an iPhone as your daily
driver is still a delight features like
touch ID continue to be so fast that you
really don't even have a chance to view
your notifications but again iOS 10
addresses this by allowing you to lift
the phone and seeing these before you
unlock the device and then pressing to
hold the home button now one of my
favorite features has to be hey Siri
reminding us of the Moto X the a9 chip
allows the service to wake from standby
and voice training allows it to be very
reliable to only work with your device
it continues to be my go-to service for
setting up appointments on the go and
reminders
and then there are the features that
lock you within iOS like continuity
which I constantly depend on for
starting browsing things on the phone
and then moving to the iPad or the Mac
and this dual-core is the a9 chip maybe
this phone continues to be a beast in
graphics performance with games it also
has one of the loudest earpiece and
speakers that you can find in addition
to continuing the iPod legacy of high
quality audio through the headphone jack
making it one of my favorite phones when
on the subway now the two main reasons
for me to move away from the iPhone as
my daily driver have to be one battery
life because no matter how you use it
the 6s scratches the bare minimum of
decency leaving you scrambling for a
charger at the end of the day no matter
what software version you're using ii
believe it or not the camera i love
taking photos and by no means am i
saying that the camera on the iphone is
bad on the contrary this is actually a
very accurate camera when it comes to
color reproduction and even without
optical image stabilization i've taken
photos while running with a success and
never have i found myself with a blue
photo in my opinion the main problem
with this camera is really competing
devices mainly because the resulting
photos from the iphone tend to be dull
are not as great in low-light even with
the boost in megapixels the selfie
shooter is okay with the most atrocious
field of view mainly for video and then
when it comes to 4k video on the camera
the camera is great but then the
stabilization from competing devices
again just Dwarfs what the iphone can do
and I guess that by now you may already
understand where I'm headed with these
conclusions at a minimum usable price of
seven hundred and fifty dollars because
buying the sixteen gig model is a
horrible mistake
the iPhone 6s is really a tough sell
heck I don't even have to prove that the
phone is really marked Apple's first
decline in iPhone sales in history and
that has to be for a reason it's not a
bad phone by any means for those of you
looking for the best and most reliable
experience when it comes to the basics
but it's not like if you can't get
enough basic experience from devices
like the oneplus three at half the price
or a more powerful experience from
devices like the HTC 10 or the Samsung
Galaxy s7 for about $100 less it's clear
that the iPhone 6s has marked the strong
inflection point for Apple and it's come
to the point where this would be the
first time that I'd recommend you skip
this bottle of the iPhone and wait to
see what happens in September folks just
