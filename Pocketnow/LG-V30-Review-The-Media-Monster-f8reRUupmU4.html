our primary phones phone fraud is
actually on the rise ATT is working to
help users protect their family members
with call protect available for Android
and iOS call protect is a free app
provided for 18 t customers that alerts
users to potential fraud and spam
automatically blocking calls from
suspected fraudsters before your phone
ever ranks plus this app also gives you
the ability to block or flag nuisance
phone numbers to prevent unwanted calls
but similar solutions might be available
for a premium but call protect works
directly with your 18 t account for free
to reduce spam and scams save you time
and protect your data click the link in

protect today and start blocking those
bothersome calls o LG we always have
such a complicated conversation
surrounding your phones from prototype
to retail unit the V 30 has been in our
hands for a while now our experiences
have largely been positive but this
launch came with some controversy we'll
need to discuss two months with the
phone how has it held up against other
flagships here's our full LG v 30 review
we've already covered a lot of ground on
this phone and this is starting to
become a long-term review right at the
top we should probably talk about the
phone's release last year we were
critical of how LG announced the V 20
and it would seem some of those mistakes
were duplicated this year
LG showed it off got prototypes into
reviewers hands which we certainly
appreciated and then we waited for a
long while before further news on a
commercial release it's a difficult way
to maintain a conversation on a gadget
and it let the wind out of our sails for
one of the better phones of the year
this is still the area we most hope to
see LG improve how they communicate with
their customers getting back to the
phone in the era of glass devices LG's
design here is simply splendid striking
all the right notes hitting all the
right cues and delivering a more
consistent symmetrical glass on glass
look then the phone it will be most
often mistaken for no joke I've had
several people in my circle of friends
get very excited by me holding this
device only to be very quickly
disappointed
still for the rated durability I'm not
the biggest fan of glass LG made the
right call in trying to attract
consumers though enthusiasts of this
phone line might be a touch disappointed
as it stands my v10 was a tank which is
currently on its third broken screen
protector my V 30 won't be leaving the
house without a bumper case just in case
maximizing screen real estate in a
fairly compact form factor taller aspect
ratios are all the rage this year and
the V 30 does an excellent job of
balancing real estate and one-hand use
like the galaxy s 8 plus reaching the
notification shade can sometimes be a
delicate balance but we are treated to a
terrific screen first style of use
it's that screen which is garnering the
most discussion though LG returning to O
LEDs and concerns over performance
reliability and consistency we need to
be measured in our discussion here and
we don't want to dismiss those with
problem devices but our V 30 screen is
pretty good the issue with benchmarking
a display it's easy to pick out
imperfections when driven in ways that
don't resemble normal use the issues
with backlighting for instance setting
the phone to its minimum and displaying
only a plain gray image our phone shows
hotter spots at the forehead and Chin's
than our note 8 which has a slightly
brighter bottom edge than the top when
used in normal conditions this is not
perceptible this also shows off one of
the weak links on Oh heads which is
coloured Samsung's displays this year
run really ruddy LG runs really cool
neither are actually correct
and when tilting the phone we see some
small color shift on Samsung to just
it's ready er color shift over the V 30s
blue tint I think we can easily declare
LG's OLED tech at least one or possibly
two generations behind Samsung but
that's like saying we're somehow
bothered by galaxy s6 screens which we
really aren't the main concern though is
for those folks who do receive devices
with proper patchy lighting or see fast
evidence burnin and this brings us back
to our original point that will
unfortunately have to wait and see how
LG handles this conversation with
customers at present I'm inclined to say
the screen on the
thirty shouldn't put you off the phone
if you were seriously considering it
tech inside is standard fare for a
modern flagship chipset RAM and storage
all on point
LG skin and custom software are still
fairly heavy but the hardware manages to
overcome performance concerns my v30
only occasionally stuttering through
some jank that I couldn't reliably show
on camera a more minor concern though
manifests with software in gaming LG is
working a little too hard at providing
users customization / game modes from
power saver options to resolution and
framerate sliders out of the box
graphics intense titles run poorly and
it's up to the owner to dig through a
few settings to improve that performance
a little more explanation of what these
options do would definitely be
appreciated but the core of the V Series
is multimedia creation and consumption
we have a full camera review on this
channel and the v30 continues a
tradition of offering users the most
feature complete package for shooting
video improvements to the lens are very
welcome and this is one of the sharpest
cameras of the year it should also be
reiterated that the ultra wide lens on
this phone is still the most practical
application of adding a second sensor to
a phone delivering a much wider focal
range than what's found on zoom sensor
devices even if it means the V 30 omits
the fancy software blur modes found on
competitors auto motes have been
improved over last year's phone though
they probably won't excite HDR fans like
some of the competition might produce
and the selfie shooter isn't a complete
deal-breaker but it is one of the
poorest performers on a flagship this
year likewise the audio conversation is
also split the mono bottom firing
speaker is generally fine if
outperformed by Samsung this year but
the headphone jack is in a completely
different league from any other phone
we've reviewed this year as more
manufacturers are ditching the 3.5
millimeter photo jack
LG delivers a truly audiophile grade
solution in a mass-market phone and we
have the full audio review with
benchmarks and charts in a separate
video
lastly battery life is well improved the
V phones have always had aggressive
power requirements and it's
manufacturers are doing a better job in
the second half of this year
utilizing qualcomm chipset the same
capacity is the g6 with a larger display
but the Snapdragon 835 over the 821 and
a newer build of Android means we're
running for a charger a lot less
frequently it won't be a marathon champ
but it's the first v2 more closely match
galaxy and iPhone plus run time in our
media test so the need for a user
replaceable battery is a lot less
pressing fans of that feature on the V
20 likely won't be consoled by the
addition of wireless charging but actual
real-life mileage is noticeably improved
we didn't have any issues with recharge
rates in the past and the V 30 maintains
a healthy top off rate when plugged into
a compatible charger short stint plugged
in is all it takes to help finish off
the day for really heavy users so let's
wrap this up where does that leave us
with the LG v 30 on a personal note this
is the current frontrunner for my
favorite phone of the year excellent pro
camera features glass leading headphone
audio excellent microphones this is a
nearly perfect getting two done phone
for me outside of that YouTube video
producer demographic there's a lot to
like across a broader segment of the
buying public LG's take on a powerful
work phablet is now a lot more
accessible thanks to it being a more
attractive gadget still it's difficult
for folks to chew through the noise
surrounding this device potential issues
or defects and we're concerned by a lack
of conversation from the manufacturer
both in promoting the device and in
discussing pitfalls for a brand to
succeed that messaging needs to come
from the top down I really like this
phone I like it a lot and if you value
what it has to offer I think you'll dig
it too as always thanks so much for
