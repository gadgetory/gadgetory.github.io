calm i'm going to show you some of the
camera features on the new HTC mytouch
4g slide on t-mobile let's check it out
first off i want to show you how we can
get to the camera really easily from the
lock screen so this is the Sampson focus
with Windows Phone 7 which does kind of
the same thing and we're going to try to
erase them a little bit so here we are
pressing the camera button and obviously
this one was faster so now they're both
ready to take pictures but that was a
good straight to the camera quick button
press now we have both of them taking a
picture
you see the focus ring is always
focusing and I can touch to make it
focus over there and here's our shutter
button we also have a shutter button up
here so i can press that half way to
start the focusing and then all the way
to take the picture and it it's very not
much sugar lag at all it happens right
away let's throw that in there too we
have a pretty good wide angle to view as
well so that happens very quickly nice
and quick shutter i also have the nokia
n8 year so let's just see what kind of
shutter lag we get on both of these if i
can hold them at the same time
there we go both pretty quick we had
some flash on this one
there we go three a pretty good shutter
speed on both of those now let's look at
some of the options we have on this guy
so we have some mode switching up here
let's start from the beginning first is
automatic then we have the sweep shot
mode which is pretty cool i'll try to
show that in a minute clear shot HDR
gives you high dynamic range that's an
attempt to get some detail in both the
shadows and the highlights when there's
a huge amount of contrast in your
picture there's the burst shot takes to
the multiple pictures in a quick
succession night mode action macro for
close-ups portrait and manual so let me
show you sweep shot which is pretty cool
see if I can do it
so we start taking a picture and then we
move it and you see at the bottom it is
moving along and there's a magazine over
there
so there's your why the landscape
picture pretty cool feature and of
course we have video mode and you can
choose your settings by pressing the
menu button over here so now we're in
full HD see 1080p is our highest option
and here see the option to switch to the
front facing camera there we are and
then we that's our camera works pretty
good we'll have some samples on our full
review soon so I'm sure to check that
out that's it for now
