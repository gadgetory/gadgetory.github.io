pocketnow.com so what we're seeing on
these newer windows mobile devices like
the touch pro and the diamond are these
finger friendly keyboards so that you
don't actually have to open the keyboard
and in the case of the diamond which
doesn't have a keyboard you can easily
type with your thumbs or your index
finger right on the screen but what's
common to all windows mobile touchscreen
devices and this goes back to the early
early days of Windows Mobile is the
stylist keyboard and the stylus keyboard
actually has gesture support and I don't
think a lot of people realize that so
this is what the stylist keyboard looks
like you've probably seen it before and
what's really great about the stylus
keyboard is that all of the keys are
spaced very close together making it
obviously conducive to using your stylus
and I've seen some people that are
extremely fast and entering text with
the other stylist so a few gestures to
talk about here and by the way this
keyboard is common to older devices like
the AT&amp;amp;T tilt so it looks the same just
slightly different for the higher
resolution devices like the touch pro
and the touch diamond so gestures what
you can do is you can actually
capitalize a letter by clicking on one
letter and dragging upwards so if I'm
typing the moon and I want n to be
capitalized I drag upwards all in caps
hjk so this will save you a little bit
of time from having to go over to the
shift key to press the shift button to
get everything to be bigger now another
gesture you can do is go right or left
anywhere on the keyboard so if I go left
it'll go back space anywhere on the
keyboard if I go right it'll go right a
character on the screen there something
else you can do is you can go down so
down to another line like so so these
gestures may indeed save you some time
in typing with the stylus keyboard if
you decide to use this particular
keyboard to enter in text and again to
get to this particular keyboard and it's
the same on most windows mobile devices
that you tap and hold on the bottom on
the keyboard area whoops and you will
get this pop-up menu and it's called
keyboard so that's it for now for
gestures on the stylus keyboard in
windows mobile devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
