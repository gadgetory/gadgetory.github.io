Lumia 900 9jz is Magna carte holy grail
new album is now live for select galaxy
customers and it seems that Samsung's
plans for Tizen are slowing down I'm
Jaime Rivera and if you see three of me
don't worry it's completely normal after
ten beers this is PocketNow daily day
off with the expected news is Jay Z's
Magna Carta Holy Grail new album is now
available for select galaxy customers in
the United States the reason why I say
select is because it's only available
for the galaxy s4 galaxy s3 galaxy note
2 among other flagships not really the
mid tier phones but anyways for those of
you that have been able to listen to the
album already leave us a comment down
below is it really good and speaking of
Samsung we know the company is working
on another platform called Tizen because
yes they already have bada I think along
with Android etcetera etcetera but it
seems that not everything is going well
on that project I mean they were
supposed to launch at this summer now
they're saying that it's gonna happen in
the next couple of months and as it
turns out well we've been waiting for it
for the whole year was actually
announced a long time ago and then we've
got experts saying that apparently the
project is already dead they're just
postponing it because well we don't know
why but apparently it's not gonna happen
it's just not gonna happen
could it be that Samsung has really
found heaven an android hopefully that's
the case and yes we've got more Samsung
news we've got more leaked
specifications of the Galaxy Note 3
that's gonna be launched that Aoife most
likely and as it turns out aside from
the full details that are in the links
down below we aren't getting three
gigabytes of RAM on this device you know
we are expecting the Exynos quad octa
processor I hate that name but among
other things it's interesting to see
that Samsung is pushing the bar when it
comes to memory and none of us are gonna
complain let's see how this device rolls
when it comes and let's see what screen
size they end up choosing moving over to
Nokia the company keeps advertising
their current devices as they're now
posting photos of all the internals that
you can find in the new camera of the
Nokia Lumia 925 and yes we have reviewed
it and it does take some very very good
photos especially in low light like the
Lumia
a little better if you want to see the
full specifications in the full imagery
well links down below for the full
description it's just interesting that
they're not showing us photos of the new
technology that's coming in the EOS and
we are getting the Lumia 925 which we
already knew about and finally for the
interesting news of the day we've got
some more press renders of the Nokia yo
smartphone which was apparently gonna be
called the lochia Lumia 1020 but then
things changed according to the tipster
and now it's gonna be called the Lumia
900 9 which makes a lot of sense since
the previous PureView phone was the 808
well we're expecting this device to be
launched or at least announced on July
11 so stay tuned for our coverage of
that event but anyways that leads you to
the question of the day is the Nokia
Lumia 900 9 your next smartphone is to
set really something you're looking
forward to in my particular case I'll be
honest with you of the price is right I
am getting it but leave us a comment
down below what are you expecting for
this phone and of course as always for
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
