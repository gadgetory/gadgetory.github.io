have the iPhone 5c in a variety of
colors how do they compare hey guys it's
Brandon Minnemann from pocket now and in
this video we're going to compare the 5s
with the 5c let's get to it okay so
let's talk hardware I'm going to push
the 5s to the side because if you've
seen a 5
you've seen a 5s for the most part the
5c comes in five colors and Apple is
calling it beautifully unapologetically
plastic you know what I think Apple
should be apologizing for using plastic
in this case because the plastic used is
no different than what is found on
Samsung's devices hyper glaze it is
super shiny super slick so that when
you're holding it in your hand you
always feel like you're going to drop it
especially if you have sweaty mitts
greasy mitts you've just eaten a burrito
or whatever it just feels slimy and if
you look closely in the light here on
this pink model you'll see that
fingerprints pick up pretty well it's
not really translating on camera here
but I can tell you that I can see
fingerprints on this whereas on the
iPhone 5s you really don't get that
except on the top and the bottom here
but this metal area just does not pick
up fingerprints so you're definitely
going to want to have a case with the
iPhone 5c now if something Apple did
right with this plastic phone is in hand
feel it feels a lot higher quality than
your standard plastic phone it feels a
lot more high quality than the Galaxy s4
and the galaxy s3 and the reason I say
that is because for example if you take
the five scene you try to twist it a
little bit try to make it flex you
cannot do that it's incredibly rigid
whereas the galaxy s4 galaxy s3 if you
tried the same thing with with those
phones don't try you might break it
those phones will indeed flex they feel
thinner and cheaper and lighter the 5c
just feels more substantial more high
quality even though the back is really
slick and shiny so besides that looking
around we've got a sort of reconfigure
here volume rocker if we bring in the 5s
we can see that the the buttons are a
little bit taller and more clicky listen
so a little bit more loud on the volume
buttons and
sides that everything else is is similar
except here on the bottom and what we
have here on the 5 and the 5s is the
microphone here in the speaker here now
on the 5c it seems to be that the
microphone smaller well actually I think
on the 5s and 5 the microphone takes up
a small part of this drilled area it's
just a design choice for the 5s and the
5 which they didn't go with on the 5c
probably to save a few bucks that
drilling slows down manufacturing
probably costs fractions of a penny
which can add up over millions and
millions of units so it's not as nice
here on the bottom we've got the
lightning connector black screws and
silver screws and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack now one other thing
that's cool about the 5c is that your
choice of color will show through to the
front on the perimeter of the phone kind
of like some other phones with color
like the Lumia 1020 this yellow version
when you're holding the phone from the
front you can see a yellow border all
the way around which is nice kind of
remind you of the color that you
carefully picked for the next two years
so that's a nice design choice besides
that it's a little bit thicker than the
5 and the 5s it's really difficult to
tell here let's try to stack them again
and maybe you can tell battery capacity
on the 5c is up from the 5s in terms of
reference here the iPhone 5 last year's
model had a 5.4 5 watt hour battery 14
hundred and 40 milli amp hours the 5c is
a little bit bigger at 5.73 watt hours
and 1507 milliamp hours the 5 s is
bigger yet at 5.9 6 watt hours and 1570
milliamp hours really not that big of a
difference we're talking about a
difference of about a hundred million
hours from the 5 to the 5s so let's take
that out of the picture and do some
speed tests and by the way before we do
speed test another difference between
these 2 devices are the cameras got a
bigger sensor here that can let in more
light with a dual flash amber and white
which can fire in many different
combinations so that you don't get white
blown-up pictures and so far so good
we've been testing this at night and it
does look like that flash is effective
at avoiding that we've got the same
exact camera from the iPhone 5 here
which
isn't a bad thing it takes great
pictures low light and not so great any
more compared to you know the Lumia 1020
or the HTC One but definitely a great
reliable camera on the 5c okay let's do
some speed test we've got the a7 64-bit
chip on the 5s and we've got the a6 CPU
here on the iPhone 5c which has proven
to be no slouch the iPhone 5 to this day
is still a very fast phone one of the
fastest out there so the 5s just makes
things a little bit faster in some cases
not many so we're gonna start them up
see which gets to the lock screen first
one two three go okay 5s a little bit
faster out the gate with the Apple logo
okay
5s is first 5c really not that far
behind it and so let's slide to unlock
we're not activated on this phone but
we're running over Wi-Fi touch ID using
my thumb passcode required after
restarting and I've got the most secure
pin in the whole entire world there we
go now we're in okay so let's boost the
screen brightness on both of these
devices we're gonna go into settings
here on both at the same time they came
up exactly at the same time we're going
to wallpapers and brightness and turn
off auto brightness and Jack the
brightness up to 100%
these should have the same exact screen
if you watched our 5s vs. 5 comparison
video we put a link up here I said in
the video that the screen brightness was
exactly the same between the 5 and the
5s I take that back that's a mistake
the 5s is dimmer and you can see it here
too I'm going to bring these up more
close to the screen the 5s is just
slightly dimmer than the 5c and the 5
this might be a bad unit or something
it's one of the first off the line it
really doesn't impact much but if we're
being picky the 5s is slightly dimmer
for some reason than the 5 and the 5c
okay so let's click around here let's
open some system apps starting with
camera 1 2 3 go
at the same time there
and of course one thing that you get in
the iPhone 5s that you don't get in the
5c is slo-mo video which is pretty cool
we're going to talk about that more in
the full review let's go into Safari ok
they're opening up different pages
that's going to pocket now one two three
go
that was much much faster on the 5s zoom
in and release see which clears up
faster faster on the 5s here's the real
gold HTC one and about the same ok the
5s was a little bit faster there and
let's move around on the page go to
another story we just went backwards by
the way in iOS 7 a lot of people don't
know this
you can go forwards and backwards by
swiping on the screen like that super
cool way to navigate in iOS 7 so let's
go to another story here we'll zoom in
and just do one more test these phones
are sliding all around especially the 5c
5c was faster in that situation just
like we saw between the 5 and the 5s
there's not that much difference between
these phones in terms of simple apps
that are on the phone like the web
browser and opening up calendar and
things like that really apps have to be
rewritten in 64-bit for the 5s to take
advantage of the faster speed so let's
open calendar one two three go exactly
the same time let's do double tap on the
home button exactly the same time so
just like we saw between the 5s and the
5 there's not that much of a performance
difference that you get with the a7 in
day-to-day use what you get is you get
slow motion video you get the promise of
future apps that are optimized for
64-bit of course you get the fingerprint
sensor which might be a convenience for
you if you use pin lock and you get a
better camera and indeed our tests are
showing with the cameras a pretty big
step up between the 5s and the 5c or the
5 in terms of low-light photography
we're gonna have a lot more in the full
review coming up
that so that was just a quick comparison
between the 5c and the 5s are for
reviews of the 5c which Michael Fisher
is going to do in the 5s which I'm going
to do will be up shortly with plenty of
information so if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and drop a
comment because it's a great way to stay
in shape family guy reference by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
