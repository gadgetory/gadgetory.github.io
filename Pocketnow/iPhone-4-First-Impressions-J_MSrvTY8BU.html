now calm pocket now is not an iPhone
site we covered smartphones in general
usually Windows Phone and Android but
when a piece of technology comes along
in the smartphone industry that really
changes things and ups the ante in terms
of a hardware and software we have to
talk about it
so yesterday I stood in line for 11
hours to get an iPhone 4 not because I'm
obsessed with the iPhone or because I'm
obsessed with Apple I'll tell you why it
took 11 hours to get this thing um at
the end of the video so stick around to
that but what I want to do in this video
is provide some overall first
impressions of the iPhone 4 I want to
talk about the hardware how it feels in
the hand how it compares to other
devices that I've been using recently to
give you an idea of really what the
iPhone 4 is all about and then there
will be another video coming up after
this where I'm going to talk more about
the software and sort of the hardware
software interplay and what Apple has
done with this next generation iPhone
let's get to it
ok so let's get started talking about
the iPhone 4 and by the way if you hear
a little bit of a hum they are mowing
the grass outside of my apartment so my
first impression when picking up the
iPhone 4 after I got it from the Apple
employee after they activated it wasn't
oh wow this is the thinnest smartphone
I've ever felt where it wasn't wow this
design is truly stunning it was hmm
device is kind of heavy actually and it
was also my other impression was and it
doesn't feel as thin as everyone's
making it out to be I think Apple did
some really interesting things with the
design to give the perception of
thinness number one they have this metal
edge which actually sits between these
two pieces of glass and protrudes about
a millimeter away from the glass around
the entire device and what this does and
they did this sort of with the iPhone
3GS is gives the perception of a phone
that's thinner than it actually is so
when you pick it up when you look at it
it looks really thin because you're
judging it by this metal strip and not
by the entire width another advantage to
this thinness argument is that the
iPhone 4 is completely flat on the back
it's very very rare for a smartphone to
be completely flat on on on its back so
that when you put it on
Table Talk it's it's completely flat
compared to other devices like the hd2
this isn't completely flat so when you
put it down it's got kind of a curved
design which pushes the device up a
little bit and makes it seem thicker
when you compare it to another device
same with the Google Nexus One it's got
a slightly curved back it doesn't sit
completely flush I can rock it back and
forth and obviously this applies to the
iPhone 3GS which also does likewise
rocks back and forth I think if these
other smart phones which are very thin
smartphones like the Nexus One and the
HD two worth to have flat backs they
would feel very similar to the iPhone 4
and the iPhone 4 doesn't feel that thin
in my opinion just the perception that
Apple has achieved through certain
design feats so let's take a look at the
hardware beyond the thinness of the
iPhone 4 it's a very very nice looking
device it has a very high quality feel I
think that's thanks in part to the
weight it is a heavy device it feels
like a small heavy brick almost although
it's not as big as a brick obviously its
slender and it has nice lines so up here
we have the front-facing video camera
for FaceTime 1.3 megapixels there's a
lot of sensors up here for proximity for
light there's the screen and then there
is the button to get to the home screen
we've got these very very crude looking
buttons here that really lend to the
whole overall design of the iPhone 4 I
kind of like it the volume up and volume
down button I was afraid of having
trouble finding them when using the
phone but that hasn't been the case it's
just as easy as the previous generation
iPhone that had the rocker then we have
this nice switch this band continues all
the way around we have the standard 30
pin connector a microphone and a speaker
down here I'll talk about speakerphone
quality in an upcoming video over here
we have the micro sim adapter you want
to see what it looks like I'll pop it
out now a big concern that I had with
the iPhone 4 and getting a micro sim
activated on my account is how
tests other phones I continually test
phones for pocket now I'd pop out my SIM
card and I pop it in another phone well
what you can do is actually just simply
get a micro sim to sim adapter that
should work and allow you to use other
phones if you like to swap phones and
this is a little bit tricky okay so here
it comes and quite simply it's a little
sim I mean it's it's basically a regular
sim card just shaved down there's
nothing really special about it so pop
it back in let's continue around the
device put the paperclip away up here we
have the power standby button and the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack there's
also a second microphone for noise
cancellation i've yet to test this i
want to go to a bar that's really loud
and call a friend and say hey can you
hear me and see what they say on the
back we get this piece of glass which
will need cleaning a lot just like the
front which is a little bit annoying
because you're already stuck cleaning
the front of your device and now you
have to do the back as well i find a
simple cotton t-shirt helps tremendously
with that here we have the 5 megapixel
camera and the flash Apple is really
touting video and image quality on the
iPhone 4 it I got to tell you that the
quality is the best that I've seen on
any smartphone the this the contender I
think is the samsung omnia 2 which had
an awesome camera but the iPhone just
destroys it
thanks I think in part to the backside
illumination sensor which really helps
the camera adapt to low-light conditions
so let's look at this morph more
specifically compared to other devices
we'll start with the legacy iPhone here
the iPhone 3GS you know sometimes when
looking at these two devices together
for a second I can't tell them apart
because they're so similar you have to
look at the outer edge and the and the
camera here to say oh now there's the
camera that's the iPhone 4 or oh this
has the chrome edge very predominantly
around the perimeter of the phone
whereas the iPhone 4 does not and that's
really the way that I tell the one apart
from the other they're very very
different on the back one's got a curved
flat
take back and one has a flat piece of
glass
obviously the iPhone 4 looks much more
high-quality than the iPhone 4 let's
compare it to the Google Nexus 1 I have
been using this as my daily driver it's
got a 3.7 inch display the iPhone 4 has
a 3.5 inch display certainly and I got
to tell you that in the hand the Nexus 1
still feels thinner but if you compare
them like this the iPhone 4 definitely
is the winner in terms of thickness and
next to the HTC hd2 the huge screened
monster here with the 4.3 inch display
the iPhone kind of looks a little bit
small turning over to the side if we
didn't have this curved design slightly
curved on the HD 2 it would be thinner
than the iPhone 4 but again they have to
curve the back to fit other components
in there I think the trend going forward
is that OMS are going to square off the
design of the back kind of like they did
with the iPhone that's just the way
things go in the in the smartphone
industry one company takes ideas from
another the first thing that I wanted to
see after turning on the iPhone 4 was
the retina display and I'm going to do
another video talking all about screen
resolution I love the topic I think it's
really interesting to see how we've
progressed in screen resolution and I
think a lot of people don't really truly
understand what it means but for the
sake of this video I just want to show
you a demonstration a quick
demonstration of the retina display so
let's turn on the iPhone here I'm going
to zoom in on the screen and I'm gonna
slide to unlock and let's go into really
any application I'm going to show you
text because I think text is really the
most impressive because you can't see
pixels unless you have Superman vision
text appears like it's painted on the
screen it doesn't look like it's
digitally rendered with pixels because
you can't see pixels so let me try to
get close in on the screen hopefully my
camera will cooperate I'm gonna get
closer and closer and I think that's as
close as I can get I hope you can tell
from here and this should be in high
definition but pixels don't really come
into the picture here they're just so
tiny and insignificant
and that it's just very difficult to
perceive them on the screen let's jump
into a picture okay so here's a picture
I took with the iPhone 3GS beautiful
beautiful photo quality this is a
lobster ravioli dinner that my fantastic
girlfriend made for me hopefully she's
watching and the color clarity and the
actual fine detail is just outstanding
on the screen again we're gonna talk a
lot more about the Retina display in an
upcoming video but I just wanted to give
you some overall thoughts about the
hardware and my first impressions of the
iPhone 4 yeah it's thin but it doesn't
feel as thin as I think the world is
making it out to be and it does yeah it
feels very high quality in hand
I think that's thanks in part to the
weight so real quick I'm going to jump
to a segment talking about why I was in
line for 11 hours at the Apple Store and
be sure to subscribe to our channel for
more videos on smart phones and I'm
gonna have a few more videos on the
iPhone 4 that's it for now and I'm back
so I just want to talk about why it took
me 11 hours to get through the line and
finally get an iPhone 4 trust me if I
knew it was going to take 11 hours I
would have never have gone I thought it
was going to take about three hours I
did not reserve in an iPhone 4 my
mistake I was traveling on the day that
the pre-orders went up and when I got to
a computer all the pre-orders were sold
out or there were technical difficulties
one of the two I couldn't get an iPhone
so anyway I get to the Apple store in
King of Prussia at about 5:15 in the
morning I'm there with a friend that did
reserve a unit it started to get really
hot in the morning we were outside for
about five hours although my friend who
as I mentioned had pre-ordered a unit
was out already within about two hours
because Apple employees were going up
and down the line saying hey who here
has a pre-order you can go to the front
of the line what they were doing is
taking the pre-orders in at a ratio of
30 to one so for every 30 people with a
pre-order they took one person that
didn't have a pre-order so you can see
how these hours added up a lot
eventually they gave out tickets and
vouchers to people that didn't pre-order
so that we were at least guaranteed
unit so I got a ticket for a 16 gigabyte
iPhone 4 and so that made me feel a
little bit better but at that point
there was still five hours of waiting in
front of me because they were activating
the units in the store everyone that
went in the store had to sit down with
an Apple employee for about 10 to 15
minutes people were asking questions it
was a mess so I was in line inside for
another five hours after being outside a
95 degree heat for about five or six
hours not the best experience in the
world I definitely wouldn't have done it
if I would have known it was going to
take that long but hey I got an iPhone 4
next time I'm absolutely going to
pre-order so please leave a comment did
you have a strange experience getting an
iPhone were you in a long line leave a
comment below I'm curious to hear your
experience that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
