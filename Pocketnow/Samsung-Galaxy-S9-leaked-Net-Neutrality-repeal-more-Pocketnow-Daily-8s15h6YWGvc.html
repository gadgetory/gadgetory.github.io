and renders and show us some positive
changes the Huawei P 11 is reportedly
gonna make a strong debut but not as
soon as we thought and the vote to
repeal net neutrality is in and has a
ton of us scrambling I'm high not only
that I am about to turn a year older so
if you don't mind I'm gonna celebrate
like I should this is PocketNow daily
the official news today actually don't
begin with deals with some interesting
strategies from Apple according to the
company as of December 22nd and pretty
much whatever's inventory on that day
will be free shipping so that's great if
you want to get stuff for the holidays
and second there's even an option where
you pay an extra nine dollars they'll
ship things from an Apple Store to your
doorstep the same day in just a few
hours I believe so yeah Apple really
wants you to be shopping at their store
yes and for those of you that have
second thoughts over buying things now
because you want to wait and see what's
coming at CES I suggest you consider
what's available now according to some
trusted sources we're only getting mid
rangers from both LG and samsung at CES
meaning whoever was waiting for the
Galaxy S nine or the g7 MWC that's
pretty much gonna be the biggest
probability which is the same thing
that's happened for many years and just
to make matters even more evident we
thought that we were gonna get that
Huawei P 11 at CES and that's not gonna
be the case either according to sources
it seems that we will have to wait until
MWC but this device is probably one that
we should keep in our radar mainly
because apparently it brings a ton of
changes that look a lot like the iPhone
10 but hey it would be cool to get this
on Android right so we'll see for those
of you that we're asking why we didn't
discuss the net neutrality vote on
yesterday's pocket now daily that's
because we recorded the daily before the
news went live so let's talk about it
net neutrality got repealed by the FCC
by a majority vote it wasn't unanimous
and it's a very sad day mainly because
we don't know exactly what to expect
well the FCC is saying that we should
trust that they won't be doing anything
wrong with throttling data or giving
priority to certain companies why then
the ruling that made sure of that we
don't know exactly what could happen and
we are actually hoping that Congress
does something about it because Congress
still can actually overturn this ruling
we'll see what happens we are waiting
for the internet to remain as great as
it is and which enables us to be able to
be here reporting the news and finally
the hot news today because I decided to
leave positive news for the hot news we
saw the first renders of the Samsung
Galaxy as a 9 on video and from the
source that pretty much all the time
confirms what devices are going to look
like these rumors are great mainly
because from the front that seems the
galaxy as an item will not change or
probably it will get slimmer and we just
can't see it on video but the changes in
the back are awesome we've got a single
camera for the galaxy s 9 that's bad but
we've got a fingerprint scanner at the
bottom thank you and then in the case of
the galaxy s 9 plus it seems that we're
getting dual cameras in a vertical
design that actually doesn't have an
insane camera hump nocknock Apple and we
also have the fingerprint scanner at the
bottom where it should be these are
great designs I feel that Samsung was
probably like oh my god how about if we
actually make a phone that people will
fully like and I think that this is the
way to go I cannot wait to see what we
get but let us know in the comments what
do you think about these leaks of the
galaxy s 9
