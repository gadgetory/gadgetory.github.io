official for third party accessory
makers HTC sales are back to giving
everyone a red light an apple doesn't
seem to be playing nicely in trying to
compete with music streaming I'm high
Meadow iveta and am I the only one that
doesn't have something like eater of
hamburgers and their Twitter description
this is parking out daily the official
news today talk about HTC is we've got
some numbers regarding the company's
sales for april and this is probably the
company's worst April in six years as
well sales are down thirty eight point
six percent compared to April last year
thirty-two percent down compared to
March and up to the point where well HTC
barely sold sixty percent of the one of
9s compared to the same amount of the
one mhm that were sold in the same
period last year things are very bad for
HCC right now we're hoping that their
new models will do something about it
problem is they're only sold in Asia now
let's move the spotlight over to aqua as
the company has already begun teasing
the Oppo r7 first of all when it comes
to design we hear that there will be a
full aluminum or full metallic chassis
for this device and it looks really good
in the teasers but even or interesting
we've got some tina certification
documents it seems that we have two
variants one of them sporting a MediaTek
processor another one supporting the
same Snapdragon 615 of the Oppo r5 the
vision say that we've got 16 gigs of
storage that is now expandable which is
a plus but it seems that the only
problem is that well you're still
getting that 1080p no bezel display
which is great but the problem is that
it seems to be running Android for dot
for Don or KitKat just because of color
OS and we wonder what year is this and I
know a lot of you have been waiting for
an LG windows phone that's been teased
for a while but wait right there and it
was actually heart good we've got some
full leaks of this device coming to
verizon which is the LG land set which
could probably be the weirdest name in
history but forget about that the
specifications this is a mid-tier donuts
got an FPGA display 4.5 inches in
addition to one gig
am eight gigs of storage up and I don't
even think I should waste any more time
talking about it I know many of you will
probably be disappointed now let's talk
about some apple news the company has
made it's made for Apple watch project
official just like we've got made for
ipod are made for iphone and ipad where
there are official accessories that
should be approved by apple built by
third-party developers and there are
some guidelines for that and in the case
of the Apple watch even though we're not
talking about third-party charges for
the Apple watch there are third-party
band options and there are full
guidelines of how to build the band's
the only problem is that apparently
third party accessory makers will have
to wait for Apple watch lugs which are
the connectors that attach to the Apple
watch which is not necessarily good
because we wonder if that's going to
help them make some competitive
watchbands given the fact that the
current ones cost a hair a tooth and arm
and a leg and finally for the very
interesting rumors of the day speaking
of Apple it seems that the company
doesn't feel that it can compete against
Spotify in YouTube the reason why is
because I'm trusted sources claim that
the company is working with music labels
using its leverage from the previous
years of itunes to convince these
companies to not allow the freemium
model that we currently see what Spotify
and YouTube meaning if you want to use
Spotify you'll have to pay for it if you
want to watch music videos on youtube
you'll have to pay for them as Apple
apparently wants to offer the beats
music alternative that it has but as
long as you're willing to pay for it it
seems that Apple wants to push it that
way they don't want to do the ad base
model and given the fact that Apple has
a lot of popularity with music labels it
could go that way but it's really
unfortunate and leads me to the question
of the day do you think it's fair that
just because apple doesn't feel that it
can compete against Spotify they should
convince other companies to follow their
own trend because in my case I feel that
no this is a terrible business practice
up to the point where the department of
justice in the United States is after
Apple and actually interrogating music
label executives over this but leave us
a comment down below what do you think
about this frenzy no withdrawal if you
want to get the news earlier before this
