will get featured on the pocket out
daily recap and I'm willing to bet you
ten dollars Murphy law is so bad you're
not gonna watch this particular video
it's cory hymanot curity kruti kurti
kurti kurti kurti f man you mad it's an
acronym dude i have to say it i love the
pocket out daily and i have to say it I
really appreciate it it's a lot of work
that's right it's that time of the week
I am high metal either this is pocket
now and this is the parking out daily
recap for last week so on when they ask
you what's SmartWatch do you want or
currently own as Sam saying is a losing
market share to a market they pretty
much got close to inventing not for the
pebble we have 1122 comments head which
sashan says I have a G watch urbane or I
like that you watch your Boehner moto
360 you don't get what you pay for with
the Apple watch and this is coming from
an apple lover you do get what you pay
for when it comes to functionality but
the design is just off man I agree in
part then grand master chef says I would
choose the pebble time it's really not
the most aspect SmartWatch it has great
battery life and carries out its
intended function well I do not like the
pebble time at all I prefer the pebble
steel becomes a design but yeah it gets
the job done which is what's important
then Jill Reed says tough to decide
between the Apple watch of the Moto 360
but if the Moto 360 would work on iOS
then definitely this one dude the Moto
360 is my preferred SmartWatch even
though I have an Apple watch in the
drawer for a particular reason if they
would bring this to us it would be a
smashing hit seriously then on ones they
ask you what do you like least about the
Apple watch as a recent survey conducted
reveals that people don't really
recommend it we have 178 comments out of
which calm says design of software are
mediocre the biggest problem is the
price print up to other watches and its
most ridiculous and I have to agree with
that it's not the best design it doesn't
look bad but it reminds me of an old
Casio watch and that's not necessarily a
good thing for somebody with the ability
to acquire a watch at that price range
mano-a-mano says some time ago I saw a
comment that said never buy a first
generation of anything those are wise
words my friend whoever you are and I
have to
ree with that if it wasn't because i
received the review unit i really wasn't
willing to purchase the Apple watch even
being an Apple user particularly because
Apple is not great when it comes to
first generation products then the
curious news says looks like a toy took
the words right out of my mouth it's not
a very stylish or modern looking at all
and it doesn't even look pretty those
two details are what sells Apple
products and once you take that away
they start looking goofy when you set up
a high price tag on it and you set
everything right there I have to agree
with that then on Thursday I asked you
what do you like to see or what would
you like to see on the Apple watch to us
we get rumors of the features that are
coming including a FaceTime camera we
have 567 comments out of which Harlem
Heppner says FaceTime on a watch is dumb
as f and I couldn't agree with you more
the memes are gonna be really funny the
Shelley man says nothing i'm waiting for
the new Moto 360 to be announced and i
am doing the same exact thing i'm kevin
says f apple i spent twelve hundred
dollars on a stupid watch and now they
want to make a new one next year he'll
know and do that's that just comes with
the territory with technology expect
that to happen that's just the way it's
gonna be and finally on Friday I asked
you if you have to choose would you
still pick the galaxy s6 or look forward
to the galaxy s6 edge+ that's being
rumored as a yeah apparently it will be
coming soon we have 147 comments out of
which dylan says i'd go with the s6 plus
better life better battery life and
multitasking features would become more
useful on a larger display and i do have
to agree with that so long as they make
better use of it and that would highly
depend on the resolution of the display
if not you get a larger display but you
get the same amount of content then
another commoner says well if they make
the battery removable with an excellent
battery life with a micro SD card slot a
bigger screen and yes i would like the
s6 edge+ other than that no yes that
would be a big selling point but i doubt
it'll happen if they're retaining the
same design as we've seen rumors and
then rubus says once a note user always
a note user and that is me in particular
as well it will be very hard for me to
move away from the Galaxy Note lineup
particularly because of the
expandability of storage etc etc
I'm just not a fan of devices with fixed
storage just to make more money but
again that's my opinion I see that's
yours as well so on Monday ask you what
SmartWatch would you buy or currently
owned as what was the thing I blank law
