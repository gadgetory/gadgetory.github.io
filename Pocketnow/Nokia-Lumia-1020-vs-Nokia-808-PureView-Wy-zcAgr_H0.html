year with its 41 megapixel camera now
that the technology has made its way to
Windows Phone in the form of the Nokia
Lumia 1020 you've been asking us how
those cameras stack up let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Nokia Lumia 1020 versus Nokia
808 PureView to start with we should
mention that PocketNow is not a
photography site we will be covering the
cameras more extensively than usual in
this comparison and we do have some
excellent tutorials on the 1020 shooter
at pocketnow.com but if you're looking
for an expert level review for
professional photographers this isn't it
like most of our features this
comparison is targeted at folks just a
bit geekier than the average consumer
and if you happen to like that kind of
stuff we make more of it every day so
follow PocketNow on social media and
subscribe here on youtube and if you own
a PureView device or any other
smartphone with a camera and you want to
share your shot join us at forums dot
pocketnow.com we're deviating slightly
from our normal comparison format with
this one folks because let's face it the
real story here doesn't extend much past
the camera the hardware differences are
obvious and the software is night and
day the 1020 running Windows Phone is
the only choice if you want a 41
megapixel camera on a US carrier because
the 808 PureView running Symbian isn't
available in America and you probably
wouldn't want to use its OS even if it
was not because it's bad necessarily but
because it's an older os that's not long
for this world so if you're here you
want to know how these cameras stack up
first and foremost as a disclosure we're
comparing 5 megapixel PureView shots in
this video most of which were taken with
automatic settings at some points we
tweaked a setting or two to give the
phone's the best possible chance at a
great shot it will have these photos
along with some raw samples available in
the comparison post at pocketnow.com
cameras and they both bear Nokia's
vaunted PureView branding these are
totally different modules in terms of
their construction and feature sets
from sensor size and type to
post-processing approaches to lens
construction it's pretty amazing just
how much these devices don't have in
common
probably the most important improvement
the Lumia 1020 brings to the table
is its optical image stabilization a
system of ball bearings and small motors
which allows the 1020's camera module to
float within its housing to a degree
minimizing the shaking and jostling that
comes with say walking down the sidewalk
the image isn't Rocksteady but it's
definitely less jumpy than the 808 and
the 1020 Just's it's focused faster as
well the older phone doesn't give up the
fight entirely though audio quality is
better on the 808 and color reproduction
is more true to life more on this in a
second for now here's a few video
samples shot in varying conditions to
help you draw your own conclusions or is
turned on in the software rather
hopefully that is making a bit of
difference and hopefully we get some
autofocus adjustment there either way it
doesn't appear to be able to get quite
as close to to a subject
fill the frame so we can hear how the
audio performs in the Lumia 1020 and and
the few review 8:08 we're going to get a
suite door entry position here I got to
get my final measure talking over the
trend noise see how they do two devices
deal with these with sound Michael
Fisher with pocket now Lumia ten
we're tasting here
the 1020's optical image stabilization
doesn't just come into play in the
camcorder the more stable shooting
platform means the Lumia can use longer
exposures in automatic mode to deliver
the kind of low-light performance that
made the earlier Lumia 920 famous now
that comes at a cost it almost always
means more noise in the shot as well but
it also means you can see what you're
shooting with low-light being the new
make-or-break factor in mobile
photography the 1020 wins handily here
some of the results in almost no light
are truly remarkable without the flash
it's possible to approximate the results
with manual settings on the 808 but
because there's no hardware image
stabilization you're not likely to get
as clear a shot without a tripod turning
the flash on gives us similar
performance on each phone which makes
sense as they're both four meter xenon
units according to nokia here we can see
the added sharpening that comes with the
Lumias post-processing approach it's not
always welcome as we'll see in some of
the daylight photos but in this case it
is useful for making out text the 808
results are fuzzier by comparison those
results are mirrored under fluorescent
indoor lighting as well with the 1020's
camera rendering this text much more
crisply and clearly than the 808 but at
the cost of added noise once again
returning to the earlier scene for a
second with Flash disabled we get a nice
reminder that as good as these cameras
are they're not perfect neither could
make anything of this almost pitch-black
basement room with no lights and no
flash on automatic settings returning to
more conventional shooting conditions
the differences in the end results
become even more apparent where the 808
hues very closely to real-world
colouring the Lumia 1020 does not the
Lumia amps up the saturation quite a bit
resulting in photos which are much more
vibrant but also less true to life
there are also some white balance issues
in automatic mode if there's a hint of
green or yellow in your photo
chances are the 1020 will boost it or
accent it in most lighting conditions
the Lumia can occasionally deliver
results then the 808 but that's a rarer
situation usually the trend is hot and
saturated
we're not sure what Nokia's reasons were
for tweaking the output this way but
it's worth mentioning that other popular
modern smartphones also crank up their
vibrance and sharpness and
post-processing
whether Nokia was consciously keeping up
with the Joneses or boxed in by the
unique constraints of Windows Phones
architecture we're not sure but the
effect is definitely not a subtle one
viewed side by side importing the pure
view experience from the 808 to the 1020
Nokia consumer eyes to the camera the
1020 definitely reflects that compromise
somewhat its images are sharper but
noisier it's camera app is slower it
packs a smaller sensor and it lacks a
dedicated image processor and an ND
filter but in exchange you get that
optical image stabilization and that
supreme low-light performance bundled
into a package that's thinner running on
a modern platform instead of a dead one
that platform also allows for a much
richer more intuitive viewfinder
experience than the 808 Lumia 1020 users
can manually set focus and shutter speed
and they can take advantage of a host of
apps and tutorials that make the camera
much easier to learn and much more fun
so which one is better well the 808
delivers more accurate photos there's
really no question about it
well the 1020 gets more mileage out of
its hardware ultimately we think the
1020 gets close enough to the
performance of the 808 to earn the true
PureView name while also bringing many
more features to the table and
streamlining the experience for the
average consumer the 8 awaits results
will still be more pleasing to the eye
of a professional photographer but the
trade-off being stuck on a venerable but
dead-end platform with far fewer
features doesn't really seem worth it
given the choice we think most folks
would go for the 1020 and at the end of
the day that's the one we'd recommend to
a modern-day buyer
like I said at the top of the video
folks you can find all the samples you
just saw in this video over in the
