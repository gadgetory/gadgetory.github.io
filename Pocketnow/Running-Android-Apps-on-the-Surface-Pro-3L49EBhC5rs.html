surface pro runs full pc apps but what
about Android apps sure why not
this is Adam Lane from packing.com I'm
going to show you how to run Android
apps on these surface pro ok so here we
are with my surface pro and first off
I'm going to show you BlueStacks comm
this is where we can get a special app
to run all sorts of Android apps on
Windows 8 and you see this is the
special one for the surface pro Windows
8 optimized so that's the one I
downloaded installed it's a beta right
now so let's try it out and I've already
installed a couple apps here you can do
the search and we can just search for
some more but let's try some that I
already installed let's see how about
Angry Birds now I have the screen set to
1080p the native resolution for the
surface pro but you can see there's some
pixelation in here so it doesn't really
run it at 1080p and here we go
so this is the free Android version of
Angry Birds and you can tell by the ads
let's try it out and let's go right
about there and do it
and you see a little bit of lag but
we're still doing pretty nicely here not
bad at all so the way you navigate
BlueStacks and the Windows 8 version is
you swipe from the side here and that
gives you a little control panel and
this button will go back to the home or
if I got that back you see the close
button this is a minimized button
that'll make it a smaller window and you
got the settings the back button and the
menu button so let's try another app how
about Google Maps the GPS location does
not work very well or at all so let's
type in something and there we go
and it's pretty pretty good it's a
little bit of a lag there
and again it's not rendering at the
1080p resolution you see some pixels
there but it's working pretty well not
bad at all
and let's try another app how about
Instagram sure
so there's Android version of Instagram
and you can see all my friends pictures
but let's try to take a picture and no
it doesn't like that very well do the
front camera not going to happen so some
things oddly obviously don't work
another cool app to try friend caster
let's see how that works so not too bad
there's our menu Frank a sir
you can upload pictures no problem
how about plume
not bad at all now here's the settings
for BlueStacks so we got Cloud Connect
dating time all that stuff here's an
interest in one manage applications now
from here you can choose the app size so
I have them all set as tablet so I get
the full width versions there but you
can change them to default usually they
install as the default Windows 8 apps
all still working flick flick flick and
we see Android is in there now one bug
as if I want to snap to programs next to
each other doesn't always work see it
went right back to full screen so I can
do normal Windows apps two at a time but
the Android BlueStacks needs to the full
screen really so when we do search we
get a list and I can press install and
now I can choose from a three different
apps source which one I want to use and
there we go and just like any other
Android we can install it like so and
there we go it's installing
here's your whoops there's your
notifications bar this is a little
difficult to activate because a swipe
down sometimes it's for Windows 8 but if
you do it just a little bit right there
then you can get the notifications bar
in Android so that's a quick look at
using BlueStacks for Windows 8 to run
Android apps on your surface pro works
pretty nicely be sure to give this video
a thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
