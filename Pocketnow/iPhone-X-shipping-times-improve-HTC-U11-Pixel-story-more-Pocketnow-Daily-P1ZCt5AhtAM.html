shipping estimates getting better we
learn a little story of the HTC u 11
plus that never became a pixel and deals
of the Samsung Galaxy s8 and Galaxy Note
8 continue I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and if
it's late Friday and I'm still working
you got to think the iPhone 10 for that
this is party now daily official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for a great smartphone or
smartphones the galaxy s 8's a plus and
note eight continue to be undi 'ls on
divers carriers but Samsung wants to
sweeten the pot by either giving you a
dear VR or a decks dark I would not go
for the gear VR I never used that thing
but hey if you're looking for the deck
stock I highly recommend you go for that
you can learn more in the description
I'm sorry about market share figures as
we get to see what companies have been
doing over the last quarter and it turns
out that when it comes to global market
share samsung continues to be not just
the king of smartphones but also the
company that grows the most followed by
Huawei and Xiaomi now bear in mind Apple
continues to be second but these two
companies Huawei and Xiaomi have grown
more than Apple during that same period
of time well see if the iPhone 10
changes that talk about a little story
that we just learned about the HTC u 11
plus for those of you that are wondering
why the company is giving this phone
such a lukewarm launch it turns out that
it's because that was the project that
was destined for the Google pixel to
excel it seems that HTC for some reason
was unable to impress Google enough up
to the point where LG had to be hired
for the job and we don't exactly know
why given how beautiful this HTC will
oven plus is hopefully we'll learn more
over time and speaking of HTC those of
you concerned with the whole move to
Google of certain engineers etc etc
we've got trusted sources claiming that
HTC is going to build as many as from
six to eight different smartphones in
2018 one of these bringing dual cameras
you know it's just odd that the news has
to be one of these bringing dual cameras
with HTC pretty much pioneer the
technology so many years ago
with the when I'm eight still apparently
we will still continue to see an HTC
growing I hope that the company does
something really cool next year and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the iPhone 10 raise your
hands who of you was making a line at
Apple stores yesterday I was at the man
has it store here in Long Island and
they had enough stock but there were at
least 200 people in line and they were
telling me that there were only 16
people for the launch of the iPhone aids
then I went to a Roosevelt Field and I
had to go pick up a MacBook Pro cuz we
meet a new computer for the daily and
well it turns out that there were tons
of lines but they didn't have enough
units and we've heard crazy stories of
people making lines for this phone I
just you know I don't believe in the
fact that people have been willing to
pay those thousand dollars but then have
you dilute and do the numbers my good
friend David Cohen from the unlocker
tells me I mean it's just six dollars a
difference a month and that's the reason
why people are going crazy for the phone
but it leads me to the question today
were you in line did you get yourself an
iPhone 10 right now because in my case
obviously I had to do it for the review
but hey those of you waiting for phones
part of the news is that shipments are
actually going to perform faster now
apparently Apple is fixing things to
four to five weeks instead of six in the
past but anyways leave us a comment down
