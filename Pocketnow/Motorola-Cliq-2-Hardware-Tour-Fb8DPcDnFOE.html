pakka calm and this is the hardware tour
of the motorola cliq 2 on t-mobile's
network so let's get started so the cliq
2 has a 3.7 inch LCD that's a glass
capacitive multi-touch screen on the
front here we have a front facing video
camera right next to that we have a
light sensor our speaker grill and also
we have a LED notification that sets off
when your have like Twitter messages or
email or not on the bottom we have these
capacitive buttons that light up when
you also have a notification so that's
kind of neat on the top we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack our power
standby button on this side we have the
micro USB charging safe port along with
another notification LED which is kind
of odd there's so many notifications on
this device is let you know when it's
charging on the bottom we don't really
have much of anything upset for a tiny
little speaker right microphone i should
say right here on this side we have the
dedicated camera button we have a power
vibrate speaker toggle switch and we
also have our volume rocker if we slide
open the device we have a full qwerty
keyboard set in this hexagon pattern we
can also hit the function and get all
the other buttons if we like and that's
pretty cool it works very well a hot
review that when we go over the software
tour on the back of the device we have a
5 megapixel camera with a dual LED flash
so we also have our speakerphone on the
bottom so you pop off the battery cover
here underneath the battery cover we
have a SD card microsd card they all you
have to do is pop this open and then the
micro SD card slides out we have our SIM
card slot and we also have a 1300 and 20
milliamp hour battery that's a
lithium-ion so some of the radios that
are included with this is a GSM chip
that's quad band gsm it also has a
tri-band UMTS which is at 8 50 1720
100 so you could potentially use this on
both the GSM networks in the United
States which of course is t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T so we can also put the second on
their 3g connections unfortunately this
device does not have the tmobile 4g or
the hspa+ that we've seen on some of the
other devices let me just clean out this
screen because it's quite fingerprint
prone we also have a Wi-Fi b/g/n chip
inside we have a we have assisted GPS
along with other sensors bluetooth 2.1
we have a proximity sensor course we
have an accelerometer so i guess i
should also mention that the screen is
FWVGA so that's 854 pixels up and 480
pixels across so the powerhouse of the
cliq 2 is a 1 gigahertz Texas
Instruments processor along with 512
megabytes of RAM and one gigabyte of
wrong stay tuned for the software tour
we go over all the software of the
motorola cliq 2 as well as see if they
change anything on the motoblur user
interface and also check out me live
wallpapers but after going through this
there aren't too many live wallpapers
available if you like our video let's
make sure you give a thumbs up and I'll
see you some comments down below thanks
