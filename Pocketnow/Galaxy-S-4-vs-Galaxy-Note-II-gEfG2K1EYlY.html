phablets is getting a little blurry but
there's still a pretty wide gulf between
samsung's latest in each category I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Samsung Galaxy s4 vs. Samsung
Galaxy Note 2
it used to be that any smartphone with
the screen creeping into 5-inch
territory would be considered a phablet
a hybrid phone and tablet that all
changed late last year with the arrival
of HTC's droid DNA which showed us that
a 5-inch display could be crammed into a
narrow chassis that's more fun than
tablet and the Samsung Galaxy s4 is the
ultimate embodiment of that truth it's
narrow bezels thin body and lightweight
make it much more portable than the
beefier note series but Samsung has
lifted some features from the note line
and ported them to the new Galaxy S so
the waters get a little muddier here
let's compare these devices in four main
areas hardware UI camera and some test
notes side-by-side it doesn't seem like
these devices would have much in common
the note 2 is a genuine monster next to
the svelte s4 almost 2 millimeters
thicker and larger in every other
dimension as well but there are some
commonalities under the hood here both
the note 2 and our American GS 4 run on
quad-core processors backed up by 2 gigs
of RAM on the note 2 it's a Samsung
Exynos 4412 running at 1.6 gigahertz and
on the Galaxy s4 it's a Snapdragon 600
at 1.9 gigahertz both devices are
offered in multiple storage options with
microSD expansion and both feature
removable batteries but the note 2's
3100 milliamp power pack is 500 milliamp
hours larger than the Galaxy S force the
biggest factor driving the Note 2's
beefier dimensions is the Super AMOLED
display which at 5.5 inches is a full
half inch larger diagonally than the
Galaxy S force it's also lower in
resolution at 720p putting out a pixel
density of 267 PPI that's nowhere close
to the sharpness of the s4 is 1080p 441
PPI Super AMOLED panel but the note 2
screen still provides wonderfully rich
color
deep blacks and more than enough
sharpness for the average user and the
added acreage is a big advantage to
those who just want more screen still
whites appear a bit more green on the
note 2 and the difference in sharpness
is detectable on text-heavy pages so the
s4 will still be the preferred choice
for display purists in the hand the
difference between the 182 gram note 2
and the 130 gram
Golic cs4 is night and day while they're
both finished in the same glossy hyper
glaze with similar texturing patterns
underneath the size and weight disparity
makes you keenly aware that one of these
is a smartphone and the other is
something more that's reinforced by the
presence of the s-pen on the note 2
which takes us into software and UI the
note 2 relies heavily on its S Pen
Stylus
to set it apart from the galaxy s line
in our full review of the note 2 we said
it makes using the device feel akin to
using a desktop computer in some cases
in part because of the air view hovering
and scrolling functionality there's also
the Wacom digitizer in the note 2's
display which registers over a thousand
levels of pressure sensitivity for the
art-making and note-taking functionality
that gives the device its name the s-pen
is so central to the concept of the note
2 that Samsung has released an sdk for
the stylus to allow developers to create
apps that leverage its unique
capabilities now Samsung has ported some
of those s-pen features to the galaxy s4
without also bringing along the s-pen
specifically it's introduced air view to
the s4 allowing a user to hover with his
or her finger over the display to
initiate different actions than a tap
and while this is a handy idea it
somehow feels less natural with a thumb
than with a stylus it's also only a
partial replication scrolling doesn't
function on the s4 as it does on the
note 2 and some of the bugs have made
their way from the previous incarnation
as well this is evident in the messaging
app where only some message threads
provide previews on hover seemingly at
random it's still handy in places like
the gallery in the custom built
Flipboard app in the dialer and
elsewhere and with a software update to
fix the bugs it could really enhance the
experience of using the s4 but in its
current form it's much less useful here
then on the note 2 and new but similar
features like air gesture suffer the
same fate elsewhere the interface is
quite familiar even though our AT&amp;amp;T note
2 here is running Android 4.1.2 while
our sprint GS 4 is running 4.2.2 while
the newer version of Android offers some
goodies like lock screen widgets on the
newer phone Samsung's TouchWiz skin
hasn't changed much across these devices
the only notable enhancements come in
mild tweaks like the notification shades
toggles and the reformatted Settings
menu along with new features like group
play and watch on the Samsung's peel
powered home media hub here the galaxy
s4 stands out by virtue of its home
entertainment system controlling IR
blaster something not included on the
older Note twos hardware so if using
your phone as a remote control for your
home Media sounds compelling well the GS
4 is the clear choice otherwise we're
looking at a very similar user
experience app launch times are
comparable across both stock and
third-party apps and the experience is
mostly snappy with only occasional
stumbles and lags you could make the
argument that software running on
hardware this powerful has no business
lagging at all but the extent and
frequency of that lag are minimal enough
to only bother hard core performance
enthusiasts if you're happy with
TouchWiz you'll be pleased if you're
tired of its cartoony look you won't
find any relief in the brand new Galaxy
s4 the you I was given a slight overhaul
in terms of the camera viewfinder though
the Samsung has swapped out the older
lifeless list approach from the note 2
with the larger easier to use ribbon
from the Galaxy camera there are also
many more fun features here like the
multiple exposure drama shot the jiff
making animated photo the two camera
dual shot and so on the note 2 isn't
exactly lacking for features but the GS
board definitely takes gimmicks to the
next level there's also been a
resolution bump in the s4 to 13
megapixels over the note 2's 8 megapixel
sensor though it should be noted that
the s4 is out of box setting is 9.6
megapixels presumably to ensure a 16 by
9 aspect ratio in this shooting mode the
field of view is narrower than the note
2 meaning you need to get further from
your subject to
sure that's annoying but at least it
results in shots that are comparatively
sharper most of the time for most
consumers though the most visible
improvements in the Galaxy s4 camera
over the Galaxy Note 2 will be the added
features not the improved picture
quality Samsung has had a pretty good
reputation for battery endurance since
at least the galaxy s3 and neither the
note 2 nor the galaxy s4 seem eager to
break that record that's a good thing
during our testing in the Greater Boston
area stamina was solid on the new s4 the
device lasting as a full day of moderate
to heavy use the note 2 with its huge
3100 milliamp hour cell still outclasses
it but not by as much as you'd think we
have more thoughts on the Galaxy s4 s
battery life in the full review some
cues the galaxy s4 took from the note 2
resulted in substantially identical
performance enlarging the speaker and
moving it down to the lower left as on
the larger phablet resulted in much
improved sound over earlier models these
devices produce very similar audio
results with maybe just a hair more bass
on the note 2 speakerphone performance
and phone calls is fine on both but
several callers told us that regular
calls taken through the earpiece sound
better on the note 2 with the galaxy s4
producing a muddier sound the caller's
also sounded a bit tinny err on our end
with the s4 as compared to the note 2
we're not sure if that's a result of
hardware or software or if it's
correctable but it is a little
disappointing in some though Samsung
brought some features over from the Note
family for its latest galaxy s offering
these two smartphones are still a
category apart the note with its larger
screen s-pen more refined feature set
better call quality and superior battery
life is still the go-to choice for
someone who needs more than a typical
smartphone experience the Galaxy s4 is
more pocketable
with a much sharper screen and some
newer features it does the Galaxy S line
proud but it doesn't infringe on the
phablet territory of its larger cousin
despite some feature blade Samsung has
succeeded in keeping these product lines
separate each one useful in its own
particular way folks we have so much
