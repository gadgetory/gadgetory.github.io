com I just want to show you really
quickly this new app that's a you know
kind of cute and fun it's called Xbox
Live avatar gadgets you can find it in
the market place and it loads your Xbox
Live avatar now here's your 3d character
you heard him jump in and it vibrated a
little bit when he landed and we've got
some little gadgets at the bottom and
he's been bored with us right now and
you can scroll through so let's check
out the first one this is a level i zoom
out a little bit and oh he's he's
leaning over there leans the other way
and what happens oh he jumps over liens
and you see the little bubble at the top
so that's kind of funny and we got next
one as a flashlight
and that can dim it or bright slider
down here to really bright and that's
his flashlight and next we got a ruler
this one I haven't calibrated adds it's
pretty off because of the 4.3 inch
screen here but he just kind of looks at
the ruler next one is the coin flip
there's got the coin
so for heads it's got a picture of me
and Tails it just says xbox live
there you go next is a lighter again
kind of silly but
shut off next one is a pretty funny to
this is a bobblehead you can shake it
it's going to bobble in the different
manner and poke it too and lastly you
can switch to a different persons avatar
so if you want to load somebody else's
xbox live avatar you can do that here
anyway that's it for the xbox live
avatar gadgets kind of a funny little
app it's about 99 cents in the Windows
Phone 7 marketplace and kind of fun
little silly tools but that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
