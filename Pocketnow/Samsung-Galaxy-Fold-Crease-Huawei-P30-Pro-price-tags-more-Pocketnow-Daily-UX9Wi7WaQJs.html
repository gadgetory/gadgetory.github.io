galaxy fold and it has a very
significant crease in the display some
alleged price tags of the Huawei P 30
and P 30 Pro got leaked and they're
moving into Apple territory and new
sources claimed that the razor phone 3
might actually still happen I'm Heidi
but I still in San Diego for Qualcomm
and I came here for the Sun and it's
raining
this is pocket house daily the official
news today begin with announcements that
shouldn't have happened as well we know
that there's an Apple event that it's
gonna be called Showtime and yet we've
got Netflix CEO already stating that
they will not be providing Apple service
obviously he'd pretty much leaked that
there won't be any Netflix here and also
that there is a streaming service that's
coming apparently he's not too happy
with a 30% cut that Apple demands from
all the suppliers and it makes sense now
it's all about the Oppo Reno project I
mean we've heard that the company is
preparing this new flagship that's not
gonna be a find or any of their current
ones that's all cool but we also hear
that it's getting 5g certification
already in addition it seems that the
display will literally have no bezels
and we're still trying to figure out
what the technology is going to be for
them to achieve this obviously they've
had the camera that pops up and
everything well other companies have but
we know where we're going on that one
but yeah I wonder exactly what's gonna
happen we'll keep you posted and
speaking of new developments we've got
digit times already reporting that there
actually will be a razor phone three
that apparently even if the market has
been sluggish with a sous pretty much
reigning supreme right now when it comes
to gaming phones razor we'll continue
building phones apparently it'll be
called razor phone three that's the code
that they've seen and we just don't know
exactly what's gonna change but we do
hope that things change now it's all
about the Huawei P 30 and P 30 Pro
obviously were just a week away from the
event we can't wait to land in Paris and
tell you more about it we've got pricing
leaks which is funny because every time
we get briefed or whatever the last
thing we get to hear is the price at the
event we hear that the P 30 is gonna be
starting at 750 which is pretty much
galaxy s 10 e and iphone 10 our
territory that's fine but then we hear
that the P 30 Pro will come in to skews
1 for a thousand bucks and the other for
a thousand 100
on the storage option that's expensive
in my opinion but hopefully the phone
warns the price and finally the hottest
news today have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy fold for the first time we get to
see it on video and anything other than
behind the glass or somebody else
manipulating it we see two very
important things the first one is a
significant crease in the middle which
obviously makes sense because the
product has to fold it's just you can't
bend the laws of you know design in
physics and everything but the most
interesting part for me at least is that
the bezels are raised
obviously I assume to protect the
display makes a lot of sense when you
close it within my guy when you see this
thing blows it does not look thin at all
let us know in the comments down below
watch the video in the website in the
link of the description and tell us what
do you think do you like the product or
not in my case
don't blame me but I'm really legging
the mate X more but that's just me leave
us a comment down below we love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us on
Pali now.com and scribe to put our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you follow me on
Twitter hi now just quarter get on
