pok√©mon calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started this application is called
Dropbox and it is free on the android
market it's essentially a file sharing
program that allows you to upload and
host files on your Android device you
can also share them with your friends
and family over your computer so the
cool thing about this is it allows you
to create different files and also
different folders so if I want to view
this picture right here which I've
uploaded to the dropbox server and click
on this and now my photo has loaded onto
my device from the dropbox server so i
can go back and i can create new folders
or text files this application is called
g-strings and it's free on the android
market and what it allows you to do is
to tune either an instrument or your
voice so you can sound a certain pitch
and we can stop this now i can either
tune the D so once I've tuned it to my
exact pitch I think it stopped tuning I
can also go to tune auto and it will go
through the entire array of notes on
this particular program and also change
the skin by going down here and
selecting one of these other colors this
is an application called free d download
and what it allows you to do is to
download youtube videos directly to your
android devices is a free application
and all you have to do is touch and hold
on one of the video files save this
video's download this mp3 download as a
AC so I'm just going to download as a
video and it'll start searching and give
me a download progress and then once
it's downloaded I can play it from any
location on my device directly from the
downloaded file realplayer has been
around for quite some time almost as
long as the internet so this application
is free on the android market allows you
to play music videos and photos right on

other certain video and audio formats so

video of splash mountain
