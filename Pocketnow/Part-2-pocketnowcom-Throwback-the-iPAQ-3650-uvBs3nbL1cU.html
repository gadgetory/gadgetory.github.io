pocketnow.com
and this is part 2 of the PocketNow
throwback we're looking at the vintage
but legendary iPAQ 3650 this is one of
the very early Windows Mobile devices
although back then they called them
pocket pcs this device was actually
built off of Windows CE e 3.0 right now
windows mobile 6.1 6.5 is built off of
Windows CE e 5.0 this device only
displays about four thousand colors so
you're not going to be impressed but
we're gonna take a look at what it's
like to turn on this device for the
first time I literally haven't turned on
this device probably in five years so
you're gonna be experiencing it sort of
for the first time like I am I'm gonna
start off by taking out the stylus now I
have it plugged in because it won't run
on battery power the battery is pretty
much shot after all of these years so
we're gonna get a little bit closer into
the screen and turn it on there it is
Pocket PC they killed that term a while
ago there was a phone edition of this
particular platform but it didn't see
that much use so we have to tap the
screen to align it this is the same
startup procedure that you have in newer
Windows Mobile devices
this is look familiar this is very
similar to the first time setup on newer
devices as well click Next although you
can't skip this in Windows Mobile I
believe 5 or 6 they added a skip button
so that people that have done this
before didn't have to go through this
procedure of kind of copying and pasting
timezone is good what I'm noticing is
that the screen sensitivity is really
good I'd say almost better than the HTC
touch Pro or touch diamond but not as
good as the touch pro2 on a diamond -
that's because the screen is recessed so
there's not much room that the screen
has to travel in order to register a
screen tap so here we are on the
standard basic Windows Mobile or Pocket
PC today screen and there's no froze
here basically it's a quick way to
access your next appointment you're up
unread messages your tasks and so on and
so forth it's hard to tell in the video
but the screen looks like crap look at
this look at the backlight or the side
light it's really intense you can't look
at this display from the side all you
get is this white sheet that doesn't
look too good so let's take a look at
what we have here we'll go into settings
and it's funny because this is really
what Windows Mobile looks like today 9
years later and we're actually going to
do a side-by-side comparison in the next
video so let's go over to system and see
if we can see exactly what version we're
running here and actually I think this
device has been upgraded to Pocket PC
2003 it looks like it has so this is
actually a later version ok button is
still in the upper right corner again
the screen looks so bad let's turn up
the brightness and see if that helps a
little bit let's turn on cleartype and
where's brightness would it be here here
it is backlight settings
super-bright really this is super bright
it's horrible
these are the old-style TFT displays
that just look completely washed out
let's see how we're doing in memory we
only have about 7 megabytes of free
program memory available so don't load
on SD be mobile shell let's see what
programs we have
one thing you will notice is that it's
fast it's very fast I'm bouncing around
from screen to screen and we don't
really get that many programs to get a
old version of pocket outlook we still
have solitaire and they used to call a
jawbreaker actually they changed the
name to bubble breaker but still the
standard same games that come in Windows
Mobile today are in one Pocket PC 2003
we pocket Excel and Pocket word which
really work about the same the keyboard
is really kind of archaic although the
standard Windows Mobile keyboard is
still the same what's very different
about the Pocket PC 2003 interface is
that you get a variety of buttons along
the bottom it's not just one soft key on
the left and one soft key on the right
and to open the keyboard instead of a
button in the center there's a little
pop-out here
so let's close that and go into Pocket
words see what that looks like
and you get the idea File Explorer
pretty much the same this doesn't come
with many programs MSN Messenger pocket
MSN this doesn't even have integrated
Wi-Fi so to get onto the Internet and it
does have a browser old version of
Internet Explorer to get on the internet
you need an expansion card to connect to
either an Ethernet cable or to get a
Wi-Fi adapter so out of the box you're
not gonna go on the internet with this
and let's see if we can get a version
here of this browser I don't think we
will be able to it doesn't look like it
this is a very very old version of
Internet Explorer there's really no way
that I can see to connect this to the
Internet and let's see what the calendar
looks like again the calendar looks very
similar to how it does today the buttons
are a little bit different along the
bottom it's not as nice of course this
is kind of grainy on the QVGA screen see
what happens when we tap on the
notification area this looks familiar
connectivity let's see what's in
connectivity since there's not much
connectivity on this device well there's
nothing listed here so that kind of
makes sense so coming up in the next
video we're actually going to come in
with a side-by-side with a windows
mobile 6.5 device Microsoft's latest and
greatest and see kind
where we've been and where we're going
in the world of Windows Mobile if you
didn't see the original video where we
did size comparisons with other newer
Windows Mobile devices I'll put a link
up on the video now so that you can
access that but we'll be back soon with
this vintage and also legendary eye pack
3650 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
