pocket now calm the HTC One X now has an
early build of jelly bean thanks to a
CyanogenMod 10 preview and boy is it
fast in this video we're going to show
you what it's like and compare it to the
galaxy s3 with a CyanogenMod 10 preview
let's get to it now when we first
reviewed the HTC One X we had a few
problems with it we actually loved the
hardware and the screen in particular
was amazing had great contrast great
color saturation one of the best screens
we've ever seen on a mobile device the
bad things about it were that it was
running Sense 4.0 which is still a
little bit too heavy and number two and
worst of all it was laggy opening a
folder with stutter going into the app
tray with stutter all around the
operating system there was lack even
with a quad-core chip now project butter
Android 4.1 hopes to fix the lag
situation by doing a lot of cool stuff
under the hood and so we were really
curious to see if jelly bean could fix
the 1x and in this video and you heard
me say a minute ago that it's extremely
fast in this video we're gonna show you
that jelly bean does fix the 1x and
makes it an amazing phone let's take a
closer look at jelly bean on the One X
now whether you're running the AT&amp;amp;T
version of the One X or the
international version of the One X
there's a run out there for you
CyanogenMod 10 preview with jelly bean
it just takes a couple extra steps which
actually took me a little bit of a time
to figure out but to your benefit I'll
tell you how to do it in the post on
pocket now calm it requires a quick
fastboot command and once you do that
the operating system boots and it
becomes just like any third-party ROM
that you install and through the
clockworkmod recovery very easy very
fast and jelly bean is amazing on the 1x
another note about the 1x I kind of put
it in the drawer for about a month
because I was using the galaxy s3 and I
took up the the 1x and I was just
reminded of how amazing the screen is on
this thing the color saturation is
true-to-life the contrast is amazing and
because
because of the RGB sub pixel
configuration this the screen is the
smoothness to it gradients are perfectly
smooth you can't see pixels no matter
how hard you try so it's really cool to
see really better software on the One X
than what came with it when it shipped
so let's look at jelly bean here on the
HTC One X everything is working here the
only thing that might not be perfect at
this battery life I've been using this
phone since about 8 a.m. and we're
already down 20% I've been using it a
lot and screen brightness is up a good
bit so maybe it's not as as bad as I'm
making it out to be but it seems to be
good enough to get you through the day
which is always what's important so
things are super fast there's no more
lag that you might have been
experiencing with Sense 4.0 let's go
into the browser first and then we're
gonna bring out the galaxy s3 and
actually compare little apples to apples
here no pun intended no Apple devices
here at the moment so we are gonna go
into the browser well actually let's
back out and just go straight to pocket
now and here it's coming through and
let's get the galaxy s3 over here so
we're gonna hit up the browser
let me get pocket now loaded as the 1x
which actually is about the finish is is
chugging through that load okay and just
like with other jellybean installations
it's fast like really really fast I mean
it's super responsive there's there's
there's no lag very seldom do you get
that checkered border that white space
same as on the galaxy s3 now we can zoom
in and galaxy s3 cleared up faster there
and that was actually at the same time
let's click on to a link and see which
device gets to a link faster so we're
gonna move over there panning and
scrolling is just buttery smooth and we
will click on the same link at the same
time and they're off and let's see which
gets there first
we're over the same Wi-Fi network here
looks like the galaxy s3 is slightly
ahead ok the galaxy s3 actually won
which is surprising because my previous
tests were showing that the HTC One X
was winning so let's go back another
thing I should mention
in the CyanogenMod 10 and and 9 actually
for the for the 1x you get a remapping
of these buttons so that will go back
home this button here usually assigned
to multitask now opens menu that is so
that you don't get that strip along the
bottom that takes up precious screen
space so you might be thinking where is
multitask well that's a tap and a hold
of the home button just as you're used
to so let's test the speed of going back
home slightly faster on the 1x but
really we're talking you know negligible
amounts of time let's try that again I
kind of did a little delay there let's
go back in one more time ok the 1x
slightly faster they're opening folders
it's really hard to tell but the 1x if
you do it at the same time the 1 is and
when X is actually slightly faster
they're probably on par in in probably
50% of situations the 1x seems to be
faster but it doesn't really matter
because both of these devices with
CyanogenMod 10 are crazy fast and of
course with CyanogenMod 10 you get a lot
of cool features that you can tweak so
let's get the galaxy s3 out of the way
we'll zoom in on the screen
we don't have trebuchet here yet which
is CyanogenMod tens homescreen or their
launcher that allows you to customize
how many rows and columns you have and
behaviors and so on but you do have cool
system settings like you can change what
shows up up here in the clock we can
change the battery percentage whether we
want to have the battery hidden or
percentage which is always nice and
we've got other other options down here
for performance we can change the the
processor clocking and here's a really
cool feature
I actually just discovered of
CyanogenMod 10 if you go to language and
input and you go to the settings and
down here to advanced you can actually
change the vibration duration in
milliseconds for the keyboard by default
most keyboards have this little bit of
tactile feedback some devices it's way
too much it feels weird but with with
this with with CyanogenMod 10 and
previous versions of CyanogenMod you can
change that to a very granular degree so
I've got a perf
19 milliseconds set up so that typing on
the 1x is a fantastic experience so
anyhow we'll put full instructions on
how to do this on pocketnow.com it's a
few extra steps than the usual loading
of a third party ROM but jelly bean on
the One X has fixed the 1x it is fast
very very fast and web browsing is
unbelievably good like really good and
you know we're just happy to to see
better software on the 1x of course so
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and of course as always thank
you for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
