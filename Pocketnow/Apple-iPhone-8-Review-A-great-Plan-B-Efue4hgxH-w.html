the reception that new iPhones usually
get it didn't fully sell out like die
phones do every year and the legendary
lines at stores were well not there the
general consensus is that most people
are waiting for the iPhone 10 so the
question of the year
who is this iPhone 4 I'm hi Natalie
baton with pocket now and let's find out
in our I phone 8 review brought to you
by D brand generation on the side of
caution has been the Apple way for
decades you can see it in the Mac where
you only see a design change every four
years or so you saw it with iPhones
every two years as well but that you
notice that move where Cupertino
launched the iPhone S II it turns out
that one of Apple's best selling phones
is a design that's a crazy six years old
there seems to be some logic an apple
retaining the design of the iPhone 6 for
a fourth generation for us gadget fans
that's not necessarily a good thing but
it seems that most iPhone users just
don't want such a dramatic change I
actually don't have much to complain
about with the hardware the move to a
glass back has made this phone less
slippery to the hand and less prone to
the oxidation effect that I've noticed
on older Apple devices with 7000 series
aluminum after they hit about a year of
use it also enables the benefit of qi
wireless charging for added convenience
i don't regret going for the space great
model I love how the lighter tone of
black on the aluminum borders blends
with the lighter tone on the glass and I
also love that the chrome finish of the
Apple logo and the iPhone Texas made a
comeback yes this is a fingerprint
magnet though you actually have to see
the phone from an angle to notice them
and for those of you that are annoyed a
deep brand skin will always help out
with that yes the front bezels seem
obsolete for 2017 aspect ratio trends
but they enable touch ID in a reachable
spot and the stereo speakers that most
competitors are missing
with the seven casting slightly less the
retina HD IPS LCD continues to be as
accurate as ever thanks to the blend of
support of the p3 color gamut and true
tone technology which helps the display
adapt to the light surrounding it at 4.7
inches it's also one of the few screens
left that I can fully operate with one
hand a fun fact about the iPhone 8 is
that even if there's a cooler iPhone
sand in the horizon the ADA's as
well-equipped and powerful as the 10 it
sports the same a 11 Bionic processor
the same storage options similar amounts
of RAM same connectivity meaning
improvements in Bluetooth fiber also
here same ip67 water and dust resistance
and yes the same lack of a headphone
jack fast charging is supported but I
decided not to spend an insane 70
dollars on extra accessories for it and
you don't really need it with a battery
this small Iowa's 11 is Apple's most
robust version of its mobile operating
system ever iPhones don't get as much
fun as iPads but you will notice a
completely new user interface in a few
services like the App Store and those
Thor changes extend even to iMessage
Siri has also gotten a more natural
voice new improvements in translation
features and if you're an Apple music
user which I'm not apparently you get
benefits like being able to have Siri
detect what your favorite music is
Control Center is definitely my favorite
update it's like from the bottom is
seriously the way these gestures should
operate and the ability to select and
then rearrange toggles is handy now not
all the changes are things that I like
like blending the notification shade
with the lockscreen which can be kind of
confusing and I also don't like the fact
that this whole Apple pay cash is
something that I've been meaning to test
and it's still not available and last
but not least for ten years of iPhone
landing into the same home screen takes
boring to a whole new level really the
reason why i OS remains popular is
because of its robust ecosystem and
services like I unless it's your
FaceTime
but not for the looks of the user
interface I've been using the iPhone 8
since launch day all around New York
City in typical Apple fashion phone
calls are loud and connectivity is very
reliable I could even say that it
outperforms the iPhone 7 in that
department
the a11 Bionic chip has surprised
everyone with its incredible performance
the obvious gliding through menus works
without a stutter choose
graphics-intensive games and you'll
notice no lag and we've been using a
rket apps constantly as this is another
one of the new things of iowa's 11 and
the phone works like a champ
best of all I don't know what Apple has
done here but this is the most battery
efficient small iPhone that I have ever
used I reach end of they better on this
phone than with many Android competitors
that sport twice the amount of battery
capacity another Department where you
can trust an iPhone is with its camera
apple claims a refresh and sensors on
the iPhone 8 but I can't really tell
much of a difference photos on the
iPhone 7 were already great so you can
expect that same quality on the iPhone 8
Apple tends to drift more into color
accuracy than the punchy saturation we
see in competitors but I'll admit that I
prefer it mainly because it makes photo
editing a lot easier I also notice that
you get better quality when using iPhone
on services like Instagram and snapchat
which I usually use but then the most
important and flagship feature of the
iPhone 10 is the fact that this small
little phone is capable of doing what
professional cameras still struggle to
do like recording video at 4k at 60
frames per second or doing slow motion
video at 1080p at 240 frames per second
video recording continues to be one of
the best things that this phone can do
and I also love the fact that Apple
finally fixed the field of view of the
selfie camera meaning you can actually
use this phone for vlogging as well
it's a conclude I have to admit that I'm
shocked at how little I regret choosing
the smaller iPhone have you been
watching our earlier coverage you'll
know that I wasn't too happy with the
larger iPhone 7 plus last year my most
important leads of a smartphone are
always great battery life great
performance water resistance and the
great camera and the iPhone eight
delivers every single one without a
problem for those of you asking who this
phone is for I'm gonna go out on a limb
and call this Apple's way of providing
users with a good plan B see the news
are that the iPhone 10 won't be easy to
get this year yield race for face ID are
a terrible ten percent with insane
delays that could extend the iPhone 10
way beyond December those of you wanting
the best iPhone right now can get most
of that package with the iPhone 8 sure
you're missing out on the bragging
rights of the new iPhone 10
it's gorgeous front that's all screen
and finally OLED and even face ID but
those of us that have been using Apple
products for years now know that Apple
is terrible at first generation products
and we could call this iPhones and more
of a first generation product the and
iPhone 8 is a great smartphone that I
don't mind recommending to friends and
family
definitely Apple's most conservative way
to ensure that you don't miss out on the
new iPhone in 2017 and folks remember
the glass fact means fingerprints and
smudges are always a given see brand
skins will eliminate those fingerprints
and add some grip to your upcoming
iPhone 8 or any iPhone for that matter
