Fisher is splitting his time between
acting and whatever that is his daily
driver is a Samsung a600 camera phone
with a nifty rotating screen and he
likes it but every day he walks past his
College tech store in the wit of class
and a bigger beefier smart device
beckons from the window 12 years later
he finally gets his hands on one i'm
that michael fisher this is the sony
Clio
NR 70 and this is PocketNow throwback
despite its resemblance to the clamshell
communicators that were its
contemporaries this Klee a was well
first of all it wasn't a phone Sony
called it a personal entertainment
organizer basically a PDA on steroids in
a time when smartphones were still in
their infancy there was a market for
stand-alone personal digital assistants
to manage your calendar memos and
address book like an electronic version
of a pocket planner with this one though
sony took a few extra steps it bundled
in a feature still new to the public
consciousness at the time native mp3
support yeah you had to have a sunny
memory stick to store anything
substantial but the clea came with a
built-in audio player and headphones in
the box
remember the iPod was less than a year
old at this point and only the most
cutting-edge people carried mp3 players
personally I was a mini disc kind of guy
but that's a throwback for another time
point is this was a big deal for mobile
entertainment and the spinning camera
included on the more expensive model
made it an even shinier toy but as its
sleek aluminum chassis implies the clea
was also built for the boardroom and the
classroom when closed it had a
conservative expensive look in that
chunky new millennium style with a
predilection for extraneous LEDs and
almost as much branding as a
turn-of-the-century Windows laptop
opening it revealed the full QWERTY
keyboard the keys were tiny and placed
high on the body but they were fairly
responsive and the device was built well
enough that it could sit upright on a
tabletop if you wanted to hunt and peck
with fingers instead of thumbs which
ever digit you preferred thumb typing
was still faster for most folks
using palms graffiti input but for
graffiti pros there was a stylus silo'd
on the lower right side of the casing
and this was 2002 remember when bold
design meant more than finding a new way
to build a slab-sided rectangle so if
you didn't need or want the Clio's
keypad you could spin the screen 180
degrees and snap it shut and you'd have
a thick but fairly compact 3.8 inch LCD
to work with at a pretty high resolution
for the period though the backlight is
very dim compared to modern handhelds
the touchscreen would also respond to
fingernail inputs and it offered the
same strange half rigid half flexible
physical feedback of every resistive
digitizer of the period for one-handed
use or to make blackberry converts feel
at home a jog dial was mounted to the
left side with a back key beneath it but
on our 12 year old second hand unit here
it is less than reliable keep in mind
that for all the theoretical
capabilities implied by these icons
there was no wireless radio on this
device the palm software had the
capability of dialing into an internet
connection but you needed to dock with
the included sony cradle wired into your
computer to sync and connect and
speaking of the software it's the old
palm OS 4.1 just like I remember from my
old trios it's speedy and zippy even on
this 66 megahertz dragonball processor
debtless because you're only able to run
one app at a time Clee a owners also had
access to the palm app collection the
biggest around at the time opening the
possibility of running everything from
video players to remote control apps for
the IR port up top but again this was a
PDA not a smartphone to do almost any
communicating you needed to dock with a
PC
in retrospect with all those limitations
it's easy to see the clay as archaic
even for its time and with some of the
first true smartphones debuting right
around them the more forward-thinking
people of the period knew that
standalone PDAs like this would soon go
the way of affordable gas prices Napster
and handsome but in 2003 the CLE a in
the window that I drooled over every day
was the perfect piece of Pocket tech a
beautiful blend of Sony's design prowess
with palms software dominance and the
ultimate T's for a kid with an appetite
for the futuristic but the pocket change
of a college student don't want to get
off this nostalgia train yet I don't
