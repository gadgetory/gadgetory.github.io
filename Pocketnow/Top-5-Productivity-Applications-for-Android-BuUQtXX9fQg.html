applications for mobile platforms which
ones are the best I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and these are the top five
productivity applications for Android
while not every application is beautiful
and polished on Android there are some
diamonds in the rough and some
applications which put Android in a
League entirely of its own what better
way to showcase that phenomenon than
with the top five productivity
applications for Android Android has
cloud storage apps document editors word
processors and PDF viewers those are
about the same on every platform
Evernote Dropbox copy mega quick office
and so on but unlike iOS or Windows
Phone Android is far more flexible which
allows you to do some very interesting
and helpful things the best example of
that is AirDroid like many of you I
spend a large portion of my day sitting
at a desk behind a computer while I
reach for my phone a lot there are times
I'd rather just use the 27-inch monitor
in front of me instead of grabbing my
phone essentially that's what AirDroid
does it gives you a preview of your
phone status from your desktop or laptop
through a web portal it shows you the
available storage battery percentage
contacts photos videos and other files
stored on your Android device and it
makes it rather simple to send or pull
files to and from your device without
plugging it up or even touching it pick
a file or URL drag or paste into a box
within the browser tab and click send
one of the coolest features if you have
root access on your device is the
ability to capture screenshots from your
computer the AirDroid app and the
service are free of charge but you can
upgrade to a premium account which
includes benefits for remote use for a
dollar ninety-nine for a month or $19.99
for an entire year pushbullet is sort of
in the same vein except rather than
controlling your device remotely it
specializes in transferring information
between multiple devices namely your
computer and Android device download the
free app and install the free Chrome or
Firefox extension sign in from both ends
and begin sending information back and
forth between your devices to send a
file link or note from within the
Android application press the bullet
icon in the upper right corner select
the type of data you want to send and
choose the destination press send and
the file will appear in a matter of
seconds on the desk
and device depending upon network speed
of course to send from Chrome or Firefox
to a mobile device the process looks a
little different but is effectively
identical best of all your notifications
are displayed and growl like form on
your connected computer so you don't
have to reach from your phone each time
at Buzz's so far it's the quickest and
easiest way to send information back and
forth between your computer and mobile
devices switching gears a bit Tasker is
easily one of the most unique items you
can find in Google Play you've probably
heard of it before but what is it
exactly it's all about device automation
you start by creating a new profile I
named mine headset connected and chose
the headset connected state I then
created a task called launch pocket
casts and paired it with the headset
connected profile if I plug in any
headphones on my Moto X pocket casts
launches immediately but I also have the
task set to perform two more things set
the media volume to ten as to not
destroy my eardrums and send an intent
to pebble which launches the music bolts
application I've created several similar
profiles which launched music boss on my
pebble and certain audio applications
like SoundCloud or play music or
launched and this is only the tip of the
iceberg there are virtually endless
possibilities for automating tasks on
your device another example I have is
when I plugged my device into charge at
night the brightness is set to zero
Wi-Fi is turned off silent mode is
enabled an alarm volume is set to max
there is a learning curve associated
with Tasker but if you're willing to put
in the time to figure it out it's well
worth the effort and the $2.99 price tag
I'm always downloading files onto my
Android devices and unlike iOS or
Windows Phone accessing the internal
file system is quite easy some phones
even ship with file explorer is built-in
if you want to get a little more in
depth with your file management you can
get an application like root explorer
which as the name suggests requires root
access but will allow you to ULTRA files
within the root directory it's a very
helpful tool I use very frequently
similarly I use Nexus media importer and
conjunction with my microSD card reader
to move files between a microSD card and
my Moto X or Nexus 7 finally LastPass is
an application I absolutely cannot go
without every password for every online
account I have
stored in LastPass and I don't even know
the vast majority of those passwords
they're generated based on my criteria
I set saved and I rarely ever see them
it makes setting up a new device and
logging in to all the services a bit of
a hurdle but the extra security and ease
of not having to remember every password
is great the LastPass application is
free to download but it won't work with
a free LastPass account
LastPass premium is just $12 per year
and it's available for Chrome Firefox
Safari Opera Internet Explorer Mac PC
Linux Android Windows Phone iOS and
Blackberry folks that's going to do it
