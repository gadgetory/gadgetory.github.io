blackberry in 2014 some of it is the
pure nostalgia that comes with a 15 year
old brand but the bigger part is the
software BlackBerry 10 is a blend of old
and new a kind of hodgepodge of
traditional successes alongside more
exotic ideas that couldn't flourish
elsewhere and while the company
continues to suffer from carrier woes
and a steady loss of market share it's
by no means taking these punishments
sitting down its latest operating system
update just recently cleared US carrier
approval bringing a host of important
upgrades to the BlackBerry experience
and we're here to take a look at it I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our video review of the new software
powering one of mobiles oldest brands
blackberry 10 to one blackberry first
officially announced the improvements
contained in this update back in January
but as American carriers have only
recently gotten around to approving the
update the list bears a quick review
10.2 that one brings enhancements to the
BlackBerry hub a simplified dialer lock
screen messages and picture unlock
capability new quick settings new group
support and SMS and email offline
reading in the browser to sync
enhancements automatic app updates a new
device manager and enterprise upgrades
we won't cover here it also enables the
FM radio on BlackBerry's that have FM
tuners installed and perhaps most
crucially it makes third-party Android
apps much easier to install if that
sounds like a lot to swallow it is and
it's not even the complete list but
BlackBerry has implemented the
improvements without disrupting the flow
of blackberry 10 which we've praised in
our reviews of the c13 q10 and others to
see those reviews and our other
blackberry coverage and follow us on
social media and subscribe here on
youtube swiping between cards and the
app stack is as fluid as ever and the
hub is just a peek away as before we
still love the unified inbox which
continues to reflect BlackBerry's
expertise in messaging and there are
more options for managing behavior now
the new message banners are a great
addition
we've been asking for since Blackberry
tens debut they render the entire
experience much more glanceable than
before obviating the need to peak quite
as often probably our favorite messaging
edition though is the new pinch to
filter command which is a genius move we
have ours set to display unread
notifications on pinch so that we can
immediately display the messages we
haven't yet responded to but you can set
it to do whatever you want other
features have appeared like text
wrapping and emails general search
improvements image resizing server-side
deletion and more everything you'd
expect from a world-class messaging
platform and most of what we wanted in
the original BlackBerry 10 unfortunately
the hub hasn't been sped up in general
marking prior messages as read is
possible but it's still cumbersome and
still quite slow especially on older
devices like the q10 this sluggishness
extends to individual messages as well
to the point where even opening a
Twitter mention can entail a significant
delay these pauses might seem
insignificant but they stack up over
time to make one of BlackBerry's best
features one of its most frustrating
counterbalancing that frustration is the
platform's enhanced Android app support
BlackBerry 10 has always run Android
apps but now it's much easier to install
them it's a simple matter of finding the
apk for the app you're looking for and
installing it from the browser we've had
good luck with sites like apk train but
you can even install hubs like the
Amazon App Store if you're looking for
something a little more legitimate this
is without question 10.2 ones most
significant upgrade since it throws open
the doors to a much broader app
selection than exists in blackberry
world the apps don't all run without
incident titles which rely on Google
Play services won't work without some
hack arounds security risks are a bit
higher than updates are nowhere near as
convenient as on an actual Android
device some apps just plain don't run at
all but if you can get around the
stumbling blocks you can run hundreds of
thousands of Android apps on your
blackberry a huge payoff that makes the
inconvenience worth it if you're a
hardcore blackberry devote a
back to the native updates they run the
gamut from the curious to the Handy the
new picture unlock isn't groundbreaking
but it certainly stands out same for the
new dialer which now offers text replies
and the quick settings drop-down menu
which brings faster system toggles it's
also nice to be able to save web pages
for later viewing
yeah these upgrades are kind of small
potatoes but they make blackberry feel a
little more modern a little less stodgy
and the more utilitarian improvements
like the automatic software updates
device manager and battery life
enhancements are certainly welcome as
well on the more creative side
BlackBerry has given thought to some
little things like calendar reminders if
a reminder pops up and you know you're
going to be late you can tell the
BlackBerry that and it will tell the
people you're meeting with which is
pretty cool
it's these little touches that push an
already smooth and smart experience into
the territory of something special we
just wish there were more such touches
throughout the OS or that they'd
appeared sooner unlike bigger brands
this company doesn't have the luxury of
muddling along by competing with its
past self people need a reason a WOW
factor to choose blackberry over the
competition
then since 10.2 that one doesn't bring
that necessarily we're still left
waiting for the next version to blow our
socks off sadly familiar refrain but
10.1 is the best version of the platform
yet by a long shot it's a significant
upgrade to the unique hodgepodge that is
bb10 one that brings current BlackBerry
owners a small step closer to parity
with their ios and android toting
compatriot while also reminding the
world that blackberry may be down but
it's not out not yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
