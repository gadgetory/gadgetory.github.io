pocket now calm and the commercials for
the HTC Thunderbolt you might have seen
what appeared to be a native of video
chat application Thunderbolt launched
and there was no native video chat
application that was actually Skype a
version for Skype really specifically
designed for the Thunderbolt that would
allow for video chat we've got a
pre-release version that we want to show
you and we're gonna test this
performance in this video let's get to
it alright and we're going to test this
over 4G LTE let's do a speed test to see
what kind of download speeds were
getting in this particular location
we've got three out of four bars so
we're getting about seven megabits per
second now which is pretty strong it's
basically as fast as Wi-Fi depending on
what kind of connection you're testing
against can ignore the upload speeds so
we're rocking fast speeds let's go into
Skype Mobile this is what it looks like
it's a very simple interface it looks a
lot like Skype it does now without the
video chat except to get a little camera
here so we're in a call Tony and you get
this option down here now for video chat
so let's hit that button we're going to
go into landscape and this interface
might look familiar to the commercial
that's Skype or HTC Verizon put out so
Tony's going to come on and you're gonna
see my little thumbnail go to the bottom
left corner hey Tony
okay so we're over 4G LTE so how is the
frame rate how's my hand look moving
across the screen okay it looks good
over here too and what you can do is
take the little thumbnail of yourself
and move it around on the screen to get
to a better position so imagine being
out at the park getting 4G LTE and being
able to do this video chat it's quite
smooth something obviously that the
iPhone can do among other devices so and
the audio is pretty clear too right Tony
very good and something else you can do
you can tap on the screen to bring up
some options and you can tap on video to
change to the back camera so if you want
to have the other person see what you
are seeing and as you can see there's
just a wood desk behind me I'm gonna go
back into the front camera and you'll
see my head pop up again in the bottom
left corner so thank you Tony for
demonstrating and
pretty good right in fact well it only
works on the Thunder boat right now so
you won't be able to do that unless you
have a thunder moment all right I'll say
this to you all right bye-bye
and when you're done you hit end call
and you are taken back to the sort of
calling screen you're taken back to the
contact list here again this only works
on the Thunder bolts been tested on
other devices it doesn't really work
presumably in the near future Skype will
release a version of the software to
work with video chat on all Android
phones but right now I've got to have a
thunderbolt we'll post a link so you can
get the pre-release software if you want
to test it for yourself and if you like
this video please give it a thumbs up
thanks for watching that's it for now
