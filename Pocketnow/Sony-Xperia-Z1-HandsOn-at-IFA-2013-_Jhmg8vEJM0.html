now we are still here as Aoife at the
sony booth and we are taking a look at
the brand new sony honami which was the
code name it is now called the xperia z1
let's check it out so as you can see the
general aspect of the phone resembles
very much with the Xperia Z which was
introduced earlier this year we have
still a blast backplate put a glass
front a thin fill with the buttons up
here a very nice round power button and
something which I always applaud on an
android phone a two-stage camera shutter
release button which will be good let's
take a look at the hardware of this
phone we have a 5 inch full HD screen
that's 9 20 x 1080 and under the screen
there's a snapdragon 800 processor
clocking at 2.2 gigahertz health by 2
gigabytes of friends internal storage is
16 gigabytes which is of course
expandable via a microSD card club and
the camera at the back which we're
looking at right now is one of 20 points
7 megapixels we'll see exactly what kind
of pictures it produces but we have
tested it out under these circumstances
and we are quite not that impressed yet
the screen well it generates nice colors
that has let's get back on the camera if
I'm not sure you can see this on camera
but the side angle visibility is not
that good
but if you're looking at that Center it
is vivid something which may always like
because previous Sony phones pets washi
smoochie colors which is bad quickly
going on the device we have sony
branding we have the 2 megapixel webcam
up top and something which is really
nice and so many executed nicely let's
get a close-up shot of that that's an
LED notification right now it's lighting
up green and hopefully there's more
colors to it there's on-screen buttons
so there's nothing here which I'm not
sure why Sony went with this huge vessel
on the bottom since we don't have any
physical but loose turning it to the
side power button as mentioned we have a
two-stage camera shutter release button
and hear this flap will probably cover
up the is that this is the Micro SIM
card slot going to the back camera as
mentioned LED flash and the NFC probably
up top Sony branding xperia branding the
lighting just changed which is always
good this is the actual the micro SD
card slot and this was the micro-sim
slot and of course the docking station
for knocking it on the bottom speakers
no firing without Byron
let's take a look at the supper so we
have android for tattoo that to running
on this out of the box hopefully it will
get before that free update soon and of
course we have sony's own custom UI on
top of it which seems to be fluid and
something which we really appreciate is
the app drawer you can flip through to
the right but once you flip from the
left you get this nice list can search
for apps uninstall applications sort
alphabetically or by your applications
which you downloaded get us from a Play
Store and while we're here let's take a
look at the camera application I'm going
to try to switch holding the shutter
button automatically launches the camera
we have some settings here self timer as
usual whatever you get in a camera
application it's not scrollable so Smosh
at our preview burst with long press
video settings and here are the main
settings quick launching geo-tagging
auto uploading shutter sound and so on
will snap a couple of pictures will
introduce them in this post and you can
see the picture quality for yourselves
that's pretty much it for a quick look
for the sony xperia z1 we'll be back
with more comparisons and of course more
videos from the sony booth here at eva
have an aunt on Michael behind the
camera thank you very much for watching
the videos are still coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
