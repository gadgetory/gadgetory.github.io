you're playing this particular game of
alphabet-soup you've probably only got
one thing on your mind cost at price
points of one hundred and twenty-nine
dollars versus one hundred and seventy
nine dollars direct from Motorola the
question becomes how much are you
willing to give up for 50 bucks I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and I'm
here to help you answer that question
with motorola moto e versus motorola
moto G you probably remember the Moto G
from our full review a few months back
where we called it an exceptional budget
smart phone
we should mention that the Moto G comes
in a few different variants these days
but sticking with our cost conscious
assumption we're comparing the Moto e to
the base level Moto G today the 8k GSM
model with no LTE onboard it should come
as little surprise that the Moto e is a
step down in almost every conceivable
way compared to the already pretty
bare-bones Moto G if there's a
specification you can name odds are it's
been trimmed the e-sports four gigs of
internal storage to the G's 8 or 16 with
a smaller embedded battery a less
capable camera with no flash and most
notably a dual-core Snapdragon 200
processor to the Moto G's quad-core
Snapdragon 400 the Moto e also brings a
smaller display that's about as easy to
read and direct sunlight but the much
lower resolution poorer viewing angles
very green tinted white and visible
touch matrix on the glass make it very
obvious that it's a cheaper component
and there's no front-facing camera
sitting above it on the e as there is on
the G but this isn't a total smackdown
on the spec sheet of note the Moto e
brings microSD expansion sure it's only
up to 32 gigs but it's something the
Moto G doesn't have at this trim level
also notice the chromed strips at top
and bottom on the Moto e the top one is
just the earpiece but the larger bottom
strip marks the front firing speakers
phone it's not necessarily louder than
the G's but its location sure makes a
lot more sense Motorola has kept its
design language consistent from the Moto
X on down but the e is probably the
biggest break we've seen so far
the chrome accents on the face play a
part in that but in the hand it's the
smaller footprint and added thickness
that really sets it apart from the G
just like the G felt chubby next to the
X the e feels a little portly next to
the G but the difference isn't
unpleasant in fact about the only place
the e feels inferior is in button travel
which is mushy er than the satisfying
click of the G's controls otherwise the
soft touch paint job well distributed
weight and distinctive Motorola dimple
makes holding each a real pleasure if
you're an outdoorsy kind of guy or gal
Motorola's water-repellent nano coating
protects each from a sprinkle and if
monochrome colors are too dull for your
exciting life each can be customized at
Motorola comm for all the feel good
balance of the build category you know
the speck differences had to come into
play sometime despite the common Kit Kat
build the Moto e is substantially slower
at well most everything it's not always
easy to see in the video but with the e
you're always waiting for a few
fractions of a second longer on its own
it's not too bothersome but considered
right alongside the faster zippy or G it
adds up you can really feel the
processor hit the E is taken fortunately
that doesn't rule out gaming on the
slower device as long as you stick to
titles that aren't too taxing but with
only two gigs free on the e you'll be
butting up against that storage ceiling
in no time one factor of note if you're
often in hazardous situations Motorola's
new alert app with tools to keep you
connected with an emergency contact and
shortcuts to distress messaging and
calling and a pretty loud alarm for now
it's only available on the Moto e and
the newer 4G Moto G we'll talk more
about this in our full Moto e review for
standard non-emergency calling on AT&amp;amp;T
in greater boston reception has been on
par and callers say we sound fine on
each with slight variances in quality
between earpiece and speakerphone though
we certainly prefer the Moto e in the
latter mode thanks to its front firing
speaker and on the earbuds front we
thought it important to test FM radio
performance still an important aspect
for many markets and we found that both
the Moto e and the G offered better than
average FM radio reception
compared to other devices besides the
software probably the biggest difference
between these phones lies in the cameras
the resolutions are the same yes and the
lack of a flash on the Moto e is a
pretty big deal if you're shooting
photos at night but for us the number
one handicap of the cheaper phone is the
lack of autofocus you can still tap to
set exposure on the Moto e but your
focal point is always the same
making close-up shots basically
impossible and generally making the
camera feel like something from five
years ago you're still fine with distant
shots and sometimes the Moto e is HDR
mode actually kicks out a nicer looking
photo than the Moto G can but the
inability to set focus and the lower
resolution and framerate of its video
output means you only want to settle for
the Moto ease camera if you have to
we've only had a short time with the
Moto e so we'll have more observations
on things like battery life as we get
closer to our full review that said
we're not expecting a huge endurance
Golf and performance between these
devices we think the Moto e is lower res
screen and lower power processor will
more than compensate for that slightly
smaller battery pack so what's it all
boiled down to well the Moto e was built
to be less expensive than the G and it
is but not by all that much especially
once you factor in the cost of a microSD
card which you'll need if you want
something more than a smartphone in name
only the Moto G succeeded because it
brought surprisingly little compromise
to its price category by contrast the
Moto E's compromises are laid out in
broad daylight for all to see if its
price tag was lower we might recommend
it over its mid-range sibling here but
with a difference in cost of only $50
the Moto G will be the smarter buy for
anyone with the means and anyone serious
about a longer-term smartphone
investment for more on the Moto G Moto e
