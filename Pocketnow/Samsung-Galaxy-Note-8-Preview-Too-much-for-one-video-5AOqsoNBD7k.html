be challenging with just one video and
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tops that list
there's just so much this phone can do
that cramming all of its features over a
few minutes of video is simply
impossible things always get left out
for the sake of time and that really
shouldn't be so how about if we do this
differently I'm Jaime medley better with
pocket now and this is what I've learned
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 over a
weekend of use brought to you by deep
brand so the two general comments that
I've heard about the Samsung Galaxy Note
8 are actually interesting some call
this phone just the galaxy s 8 plus with
an S Pen and visually that's true but
our future comparison will prove that
there is a lot more technology tucked
into the note the second comment is that
this phone is unapologetically large
just too big to be handled with one hand
and while that's obviously true I think
that they're missing the bigger picture
I mean I'm the first person to
criticized the lack of ergonomics on a
phone but this device is really on a
class of its own see ever since its
inception the Galaxy Note was envisioned
as a device that would help you replace
a notepad and taking notes on a small
canvasses actually cumbersome this phone
is supposed to be large with the larger
canvas actually serving an intended
purpose now the setup process is not
very different to your standard Samsung
Galaxy you set up Wi-Fi and add your
Google Account and then you can choose
if you want to set it up as new or
restore from an old device and I chose
to restore from the essential phone to
not drag carrier bloat along then you
can define any form of biometric
authentication which I usually stick to
the fingerprint and iris scanning as I'm
not really convinced over the security
of the facial recognition then Samsung
cloud pops up and I'll admit that I'm
actually liking how well it syncs stuff
between other Samsung Galaxy devices so
I do recommend it once that part of the
restore process is done I've still used
samsung Smart Switch just to be able to
restore the order of my home screen from
the s8 plus and like last time this
actually worked like a charm
this is Samsung experience 8.5 on top of
Android 7.1 type 1 and it actually
includes a few new tricks that I haven't
really seen on the s8 plus just yet
as in typical Samsung fashion we have
new wallpapers that are exclusive to the
notes that bring extra animations to the
always-on display I also notice a 5 by 6
grid for the applications on the
launcher something that I find just so
convenient for a canvas that's this
large and speaking of applications you
can still create separate apps on secure
folder for applications and files that
you want to keep private but I noticed
that there's this new dual messenger
feature that pretty much allows you to
install a third version of messenger
apps something that can be useful for
some those of you that were delighted by
the app pears feature well this is
actually my new favorite tool I notice
that it only works on the edge displayed
but having the quick shortcut to
specific combinations of apps has made
the use of multi window and even the use
of the edge display more useful to me
than ever and for those of you that are
complaining of this phone being too
large
one-handed mode is back just gesture or
triple touch on the home button and bam
your note is ready for one-handed use
yes you can still switch the order of
the navigation buttons definitely do so
and while you're at it notice that there
is the new button to quickly hide and
reveal the navigation buttons when you
need to when it comes to the s-pen we'll
have a separate video going through its
features one of my favorites so far is
the fact that air command now allows you
to add more shortcuts and then Bixby has
also received a major overhaul I like
this new way where you just press and
hold on the dedicated button to call on
Bixby and once you release the
application will respond to you pretty
much like a two-way radio
now how many features are actually
useful is a different story
my productivity has actually grown a lot
with this combo of the S Pen and
Microsoft OneNote but it's still too
early to judge our full review will
chime in on our final verdict over what
you'll really be using this phone for
and what needs improvement my favorite
over this honeymoon phase is definitely
this infinity display which just keeps
getting bigger better and brighter and
I'm also really enjoying my first couple
of days with this camera it's just
really hard to not fall in love with
Samsung's approach to saturation detail
and photography and though I will admit
that I haven't really had a chance to
test portrait mode much it has proven to
be really awesome so far again our
review process has just begun
there is so much to testin that takes
time once real camera review is coming
soon as real audio review is already
live and yes there are a lot of
comparisons coming very soon so stay
tuned and while that happens that class
back will need some protection the brown
skins will eliminate those fingerprints
and add some grip to your upcoming
Galaxy Note 8 or any galaxy for that
matter
