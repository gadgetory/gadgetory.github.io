and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for windows phone
let's check it out okay this week's game
is called gerbil physics so let's jump
right in and play now I have 72 levels
to choose from so let's see which one
should I do how about now this is a very
similar to implode except instead of
chalk drawings of buildings we have
gerbils in boxes and these are
indestructible boxes and they are put
there by eagle toads and flying penguins
anyway the object is to place bombs in
order to make the structure of gerbils
fall below this yellow line these are
gerbils that you are there alert
dribbles and you don't want to touch
them because that's collateral damage
alright so we place there's our bomb
we're going to place one and it comes
down as soon as you place it and that
went totally the wrong direction I press
the back button I can restart it so
let's see maybe right there oh that put
to that was the undo bomb button
we can pan around hopefully oh that
touch that one okay here's a different
level and i am showing three different
kinds of Bob's there we can select them
by tapping it and those watermelons are
explosive and I have to get all the
gerbils over the ledge and below the
line so let's try this one and may be
right there now you see this little icon
there that's another special bob and if
i can get a dribble to hit that it's
going to give me one of those up there
and those are going to disintegrate
herbals just by touching them because
you can see this one is attached to the
chain and he's not going to be able to
go a little line up missed it
okay let's look at one more level you
can see where all the gerbils are and I
think I'm going to do this one that's
going to make the lever tilt now that
has stuck
there we go that did it and it's oh no
it didn't there's one more guy over
there
there we go of course there's
achievements and leaderboards and
helping options just volume control here
and you can view tutorials or view the
cutscenes as a little cartoon story
achievements we have 20 of them for 200
gamerscore and of course leaderboards
you can see who else is planed let's get
that so that's about it for gerbil
physics will be available tomorrow on
Wednesday for 299 in the windows phone
marketplace of course a free trial will
also be available it is a lot like
implode but there are enough differences
to make it fun and first half is pretty
easy so it doesn't get too frustrating
which is good but there are still some
challenging puzzles and the graphics are
more interesting than implode so overall
I really like this game print
entertaining so give us a thumbs up if
you liked this video and that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
