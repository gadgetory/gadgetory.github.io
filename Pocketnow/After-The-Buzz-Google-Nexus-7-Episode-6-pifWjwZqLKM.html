when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappeared
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's take a look at
another device a tablet this time whose
day as the media darling has come and
gone I'm Michael Fisher with
pocketnow.com this is the Google Nexus 7
and this is episode 6 of after the buzz
the Nexus 7 was Google's attempt to
bring the pure Android experience at
pioneered with the Nexus One Nexus S and
Galaxy Nexus smartphones to the tablet
space released in July 2012 it's a small
7-inch tablet built by a seuss powered
by the quad-core Tegra 3 processor
running a stock build of Android 4.1.1
jelly bean the Nexus 7 doesn't have much
going on in the way of deluxe features
the build quality is good but not
premium there's no special amenities
like a primary camera the highest
storage option available is 16 gigs and
while the display is high resolution its
color reproduction isn't the best
ordinarily that kind of a list of
compromises would have sent a device in
mid-2012 right to the bottom of my wish
list and to be honest at first I was
bored but the Nexus 7 has two things
going for it and those two things
grabbed headlines right out of the gate
the first was its branding as a Nexus
device the new tablet was guaranteed
always to receive the latest version of
Google's OS first without any of the
hang-ups of a manufacturer scan or a
carrier interference to get in the way
some problems that were faced by the
Galaxy Nexus LTE which we talked about
on the last episode of after the buzz as
a pure Nexus device the Nexus 7 had a
real leg up in utility the second was
pricing Google priced the Nexus 7 to
sell at $1.99 for the 8 gig version and
249 for the 16 gig unit that put it
head-to-head with Amazon's Kindle Fire
except the Nexus 7 had better specs and
none of Amazon's forked Android OS
limitations plus it was backed up by the
freshly reinvented Google Play Store and
its bevy of books movies and music
suddenly Google had a contender in the
mid-size tablet space complete with its
own content store frankly I still didn't
care the device still seemed like too
big a compromise to me in fact it wasn't
until I got my hands on one that things
started changing but then they changed
quickly
the first big stand out for me was
hardware this isn't the thinnest device
around
or the lightest but it's perfectly sized
for my exceedingly average hand plus its
340 grams keep it from feeling too cheap
or chintzy but also make it much more
portable than my 660 gram 2012 Edition
Verizon iPad the Nexus 7 can fit in an
upper pocket but that's a little absurd
less absurd if you're into cargo pants
like it's still 1997 is cargo pocket
carrying of course carrying it in a bag
makes more sense than any of these
options and it's perfect for that that's
true even if you don't want to invest in
a case I hate cases and I never buy them
as a result I have to gingerly treat my
easily scratch iPads metal case with kid
gloves but with the Nexus 7's sturdy
rubberized finish
I don't think twice about throwing it in
a bag with my keys pens and pencils
whatever sure after a season of use it's
got a scuff here and there and it does
tend to pick up sweaty fingerprints very
very easily but it's held up remarkably
well considering how often I just throw
it around and it lasts quite a while
being thrown around to battery life
isn't as good as a larger tablet but it
definitely lasted me the transatlantic
flight to Aoife in Berlin without a
problem and it's screen was bright
enough to read on a beach for most of
the summer but I wouldn't call it
exceptional in sunlight
like most LCD panels it's not just the
hardware that won me over though jelly
bean running on the Nexus 7 is fast its
stable and it's very useful the
usability bump is thanks in part to
project butter which has made the
experience much smoother than any
previous version of Android that holds
true even over time with the Nexus 7
staying responsive even after many app
installs and a whole lot of uptime there
are occasional hiccups with the build on
my device though with usability bugs
popping up after about a week between
restarts these manifest as touchscreen
responsiveness issues that actually make
the device tough to use but they don't
pop up often and a soft reset clears
them up just fine jelly beans other
enhancements like Google now were cool
at first but quickly lost their luster
the service is handy but less so on a
tablet than a phone I typically only
find myself given cards with information
that would have been useful about a few
days ago but jelly beans new voice
dictation continues to come in handy
quite often and the OS has slick
responsiveness is a real breath of fresh
air especially when you consider it
didn't sacrifice customized ability to
get it even the notification bar which I
still think is misplaced way up at the
top of the screen isn't as big a hassle
as I thought it would be taken together
all the raw utility and stability of the
software coupled with the portability
and sturdiness of the hardware have made
the Nexus 7 one of the bigger surprises
of my 2012 even after three months I
really really liked it and as I've
mentioned on the pocket now weekly
podcasts more than once I now use it
exclusively as my tablet of choice even
more than the category leading iPad
there have been more announcements in
the tablet category lately Amazon has
followed up on their Kindle Fire line
and and I've had many from Apple is
almost a sure thing if the leaks are to
be believed but even in the face of all
that I'd still have no hesitation
recommending a Nexus 7 to a first-time
tablet buyer it's a great size running a
great OS in its pure form it's
guaranteed to get timely updates and
it's as cheap as all get-out best of all
it appears to age well and here on after
the buzz that's what we're all about
