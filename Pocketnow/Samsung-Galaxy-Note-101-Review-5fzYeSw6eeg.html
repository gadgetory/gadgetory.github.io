market for quite some time tablets in
general are still trying to figure out
exactly what they need to be and are on
the cusp of an evolution they're trying
to determine just how big their screen
should be or how small how thick they
should be or how thin if it should be
finger only or if it's going to be more
productive to have keyboards and stylus
trying to answer all of those questions
and compete in an already saturated
market is the samsung galaxy note 10.1
will it live up to the hype let's dive
into the review and find out the samsung
galaxy note 10.1 isn't much of a note at
all in fact leaving its predecessor
notes behind the note 10.1 is more like
the galaxy tab then again the Galaxy Tab
77 is more of a note I think they're
doing it just to confuse us but that
aside let's dive right into some specs
the screen on the note is a huge 10.1
inches but the resolution falters a bit
coming in below HD at only 12 90 x 800
pixels the screen however is bright and
fairly high resolution it's no Retina
Display but it looks very good and has
good contrast and color representation
powering that display is a 1.4 gigahertz
quad-core exynos 4412 and it's available
in both 16 and 32 gig varieties and both
come with an external microSD slot which
will let you expand up to another 32 gig
quickly and easily the differentiating
features of this tablet are its front
firing speakers and sweet of stylus
friendly apps which take advantage of
its s-pen stylus the front of the device
is optimized for a landscape experience
at the top is the 1.9 megapixel front
facing camera and ambient light sensor
to the right and left of the screen just
outside the bezel are two off-center
speakers the right and left sides of the
note are completely bare the bottom has
the samsung proprietary port
and the microphone pinhole turning the
note over you'll find a slick back cover
along with a 5 megapixel camera with LED
flash more on that later the top is
where all the fun bits are you'll find
the power button the volume rocker which
is a bit unusual we'll get to that in a
minute too and the micro SD card slot
headphone jack and I Airport are right
over here the hardware itself looks
beautiful that beauty doesn't extend to
the in hand experience the screen is a
fingerprint magnet and quickly gets
covered by an oily film that is
underscored by stylus trails all across
it the back panel seems to be the same
material and texture of the galaxy s3
and it's every bit of slippery Samsung
has gone to great lengths to make their
user interface look nice they've
developed their own TouchWiz UI with
their nature UX complete with sounds and
textures that you'd expect to find in
nature the lock screen on the note 10.1
emphasizes the fact that it's a tablet
enabled device with a beautiful picture
of a fountain pen the home screen comes
pre-loaded with widgets and shortcuts
that help introduce you to what the
tablet can do and heavily features
samsung stylus friendly apps one of the
more subtle yet elegant interface
elements is the shortcut bar that
automatically activates on the right
side of the screen when you remove the s
pen from it's stylist well what's
included in the shortcut bar my stylist
friendly apps of course Samsung has an
uphill battle to try and make an
environment to take advantage of their
s-pen to do so they've included S note
for note taking PS touch which is
Photoshop and even a game called crayon
physics Smart Remote isn't what you
might think it's not just a big grid of
buttons and numbers that you push to
change the channel on your TV instead of
a big grid of buttons it's more of an
on-screen menu that shows you what's on
now based on your location and your
chosen content provider it shows you
what's coming up next then very easily
lets you turn your home entertainment
system on including your stereo and it
changes to the right channel
so with a quad-core 1.4 Exynos processor
you'd expect this thing to fly how did
it do speed on the note 10.1 is snappy
but everyday activities are not always
buttery smooth that's not surprising
since it's only running android 4.0
point for ice cream sandwich we expect a
jelly bean upgrade will all but
eliminate any hesitation you might come
across even still unless you're very
picky you're not going to complain about
the speed of a note inside the note 10.1
is a 7000 milliamp hour battery no I
didn't read that wrong 7000 milliamp
hours how does it hold up in our review
we charged it once as it sits now we're
at six days 14 hours 48 minutes and 44
seconds you want to get nitty-gritty now
that's mixed use but push notifications
for facebook twitter email via gmail and
via exchange we're all running all the
time we ran games we browsed the web we
use the calendar we took notes we
listened to a lot of music we even did
some light video watching both on
Netflix and on Google Play Movies oh and
that's what Samsung's special power
saving mode turned off so what did we
like and what didn't we like about the
tablet for starters one of the things
that we really liked was the nice big
screen it looked good not great but it's
going to do what you want with a 10.1
inch tablet the next thing we like was
front firing speakers this lets you hear
your content without blasting it to
everyone around you or being too quiet
one of samsung's advancements is multi
screen which lets you run multiple apps
on the same screen at the same time
though only a few apps currently support
this feature and as we just mentioned
battery life is nothing short of amazing
how about some cons well the volume
button is upside down
the screen gets oily and it shows stylus
trails which doesn't look good at all
that leads us to construction it's not
really well built I mean it feels good
in hand but it creaks and it squeaks
that's just not something that we'd
expect from a high-end tablet let alone
the highest end tablet from a particular
manufacturer and last the S note app
it's got great potential but it doesn't
live up to our stylist friendly
expectations to do things that you could
do on Apple's Newton requires extra
steps so if you'd like to pick up your
very own samsung galaxy note 10.1 they
are available now they come in two major
configurations a 16 and a 32 gig the 32
gig is going to cost you just shy of
five hundred fifty dollars us and the 16
gig is going to cost you about fifty
bucks less we've seen that difference
before on other tablets like the Nexus 7
though this one has double the space and
an SD card slot just in case it's not
enough so in conclusion can we recommend
that you get the samsung galaxy note
10.1 absolutely with a couple
considerations first of all this is a
big tablet if you're used to the Nexus 7
or even the kindle fire this is a lot
larger it comes with a larger price tag
to why the screens bigger it's got
longer battery life and it's also not
twice the storage space and external
expandability now is that worth paying
double for some people might think so
for us that's probably a little bit too
high of a premium but you've got to
consider Google pulled the rug out of
everybody with the Nexus 7 and
everyone's still kind of recovering from
that are you going to regret paying the
money for it probably not this is a good
tablet there are some things that we'd
like to have fixed like some kind of a
better screen that doesn't attract oil
and leave track marks when you write
your stylus over it that's something
that you just have to keep on top of by
cleaning your screen off how about the
s-pen sweet
that's the biggest thing it's got going
for it unfortunately it's not quite as
user friendly but still very powerful I
hate to say it but Samsung needs to take
a page from the Apple playbook and I
know they've gotten in trouble for doing
this before but look back at Newton see
how easy that was to do a lot of the
same things that the S note app is doing
I'm not saying copy them I'm just saying
learn from what they did and take it to
the next level once those things are
taking care of the stylus is really
going to revolutionize the way that
we're using our tablets and Samsung is
pushing that for everyone so for that
alone we have to be appreciative of
Samsung and everything they do back to
this tablet can I recommend it
absolutely I'm going to be sad to send
it back but all good things must come to
an end as far as pocket now goes we give
this a solid eight out of 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
