pocketnow.com and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications and very same teach so
let's get started with tiered data plans
becoming more common it makes sense to
want to keep track of your 3G and 4G and
cellular data so that you don't incur
any overage charges so this application
is called 3g watchdog and it is free on
the android market what it does is it
breaks down the all of the data that
you've had received transmitted over the
quota today at weekend month and you can
also go into settings and change all of
that so let's say you want to change
your quota change that here it can also
add alert so it warns me at fifty
percent or whatever percentage i have
set this application is called best tube
and it is free on the android market
what it allows you to do is to download
youtube videos directly to your android
device and you can either save them as
video files or as mp3 so lets you find a
great song on one of the videos or
something you want to save as mp3 you
can do that rather easily so you can go
down to the menu button and search so
let's say that I want to search your
pocket now I'll just click on here and
it will load the videos and if I want to
view this video I can either click on it
and I can either preview it or I can
download it directly to my device this
free applications called ether real dial
pad alleged create music on your Android
device by moving your finger across the
screen so you have a few patterns you
can select from so I like this one so
all you have to do is move your finger
up and down and it begins to make
synthesized music
and it changes the pitches higher you go
up on the screen and goes lower the
lower you go on the screen so we go back
and select another pattern it allows you
to select each various tone and note by
moving your finger across the brain
gesture search is a free application
available on the android market the
latch to use gestures to find various
programs context music or practically
anything I've disabled the context to
protect the privacy of my friends and
coworkers so what's that I want you find
browser all you do is start typing in
browser and it comes up rather quickly
so I can just go back by moving to the
left and if i want i can add a space by
moving to the right so let's say that i
wanted to find another application i'll
have to do is type that in and you can
set the speed of your writing style and
it comes up very quickly movie night out

android market that will help you plan a
perfect evening for either family or
that special someone so you can pick the
specific day and you can also select
your location and select the time that
you would like to use movie night out

start with i selected coffee and then a
frightful night here it can either
