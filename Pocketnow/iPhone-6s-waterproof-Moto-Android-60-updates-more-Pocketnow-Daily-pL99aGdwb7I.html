more water resistant that we thought ZTE
claims that the Huawei nexus 6p needs to
be a tad more original in its design in
motorola provides its roadmap for
Android 60 marshmallow I'm Hyneman iveta
rushing with the work today so that I
could honor Friday as I should this is
sparking out daily the official news
today bigger with Motorola and Android
6th auto marshmallow the company has
come clear as to its plans for updates
and in a nutshell if you own any Moto X
from last year or this year or motor G
you are pretty much covered but then in
the case of the Moto e we do not find it
on the list there is a link in the
description with full details on which
devices are getting it but the problem
is that we don't know when the software
update will come and we also hear the
services like boat Oasis will no longer
exist because marshmallow coverage the
other official news come from Amazon
this is rather weird the company that
does everything it sells everything in
its store has just confirmed that it'll
be pulling the Apple TV and also the
google chromecast from its listing as of
October 29 because these services do not
offer you an easy way to get amazon
prime video this is just crazy the
company has never really hindered sales
from other products just because of
competitive grounds but it does seem
that amazon wants to play hardball
that's rather sad for the company and
for those of you that join me in not
liking the design behind the google
huawei nexus 6p we are not alone as ZT
is now complaining that this design is
unoriginal according to the company this
device looks identical to hear this the
grand s from back in 2013 now these are
two products that are from very
different categories and very different
years apart but yeah we could say that
the design of this nexus 6p is sadly
uninspired but hey let's just see if
this ends up in any sort of lawsuit and
just like we found a ton of leaks when
it comes to the Microsoft the Lumia 950
950 XL we also know that the company is
working on its microsoft surface pro 4
and we've got some trusted sources that
are claiming that microsoft plans to
bring a very smart frame to this design
up to the point where we
nazi puzzles on at least the three of
the corners of the device or at least
two it's going to be rather interesting
to see what the argument will be with
these you know smart frames or smart
bezels what exactly is microsoft
planning to do because you have to hold
the tablet somehow let's see how they
plan to pull that off and finally the
hot news of today are rather interesting
as instead of hearing of another gate
like bent gate or antennagate or
whatever for the iphone success we
actually have seen a ton of videos on
youtube that claim that the iphone
success is in fact waterproof up to the
point where i fix it just tore it down
again and just showed us exactly how is
it that apple has made waterproofing a
thing with the iphone success even
though the company hasn't really touted
that it is that's rather interesting to
see why Apple has not claimed of its
devices waterproof it just seems that
the company is trying to protect it from
replacements or swaps or just make it
usable for whatever they want to replace
somebody spell and then refurbish it
it's really hard to predict exactly why
Apple wants to do this but it does lead
me to the question of the day do you
care about your phone being waterproof
today because in my case I actually do
the problem is that device is like from
Samsung are no longer supporting this
it's the main reason why i'd like to
give a Sony devised a try but it's not a
make-or-break thing for me but it's
something nice to have leave us a
