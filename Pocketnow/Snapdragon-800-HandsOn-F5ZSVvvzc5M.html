pocketnow.com here at CES 2013 talking
about the Snapdragon 800 this is the CPU
you're going to want in all of your
phones it's a successor to the s4 pro
why they didn't call it the s4 pro 2 or
something I don't know it's a little
confusing with the 800 we're going to
take a look at some reference hardware
to see how it performs ok so what we
have here some reference hardware we've
got asphalt 7 which one most Android
devices is black so let's see how this
half dragon 800 handles this is a pre
high res tablet put some things 1920 x
1080 just as a frame of reference let's
take a look
pretty smooth as butter it definitely
was to notice a small time experience
that I've ever seen on an android phone
or tablet maybe even as good as it is on
iOS dare I say so
textures a good frame rate is quite good
so let's stop this real quick and
actually just bounce around the
operating system quickly again this is
reference hardware there's nothing
really on here just just to give you a
sense of the speed and fluidity with a
really fibrous screen is just running on
a jelly bean to keep it snappy keep it
good and again it's really difficult to
tell
in your next devices and we can't wait
to see phones and tablets with the 800
so what we have here is an environment
that qualcomm need to really showcase
the power of the Snapdragon 800 so what
we have years and really has reflected
certain water
smooth texture is great like walk on me
this eternity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
