utterly show on htc accord Windows Phone
in a future nexus 7 could support data
I'm hi Mary vera and this is pocket now
daily
Nokia September fifth event is just
around the corner and we already landed
some photos of what we could expect in
their smartphone lineup the Lumia 920
and 820 seem to bring all the bells and
whistles that we could expect for
Windows Phone 8 when it comes to
specifications but they add the extra
punch of probable Nokia 808 PureView
technology meaning we'll get a much
better camera on these phones that we've
ever seen on Windows Phone or pretty
much any other smartphone in the past
except for obviously the 808 PureView
there's no guarantee that we'll get both
devices on the same event but hey we
could always just stream other leaks
have HTC working on a new Accord and it
has nothing to do with on this flagship
this is just one out of three possible
Windows Phone 8 smartphones coming from
HTC this year and even though the
renders show a very ugly color for a
smartphone the specs are not ugly at all
now other rumors have HTC also working
on bringing Beats Audio to the windows
phone line up so let's just hope we hear
the music whenever microsoft launches
windows phone 8 really soon the google
nexus 7 while considered by many as one
of the best android tablets in the
market thus does the point when it comes
to its lack of mobile data recent rumors
have a sous and Google both working on a
new variant of the Nexus 7 that will
support data connectivity but we still
have no confirmation if this will be
both 3g and 4g connectivity it should be
that way but hopefully this will be the
case though sadly the timeline does seem
that it'll happen within the next six
weeks at least so don't hold your breath
for this one when it comes to Apple
recent leaks have a revamp set of
earbuds coming to the next generation
iphone the interesting part here is that
these earbuds look like nothing I've
ever seen in the past though the website
the leak them from Vietnam has really
never missed the shot when it comes to
iOS leaks in the past so we could
consider these to be true Apple hasn't
really read out they're here but since
2008 so at least I hope that this time
they will get these ones right and
finally as amazon recently patented a
tablet that's capable of having two
screens one with the ink on one side and
an LCD on the other it's interesting to
find that at IFA there's already a
company that's bringing a smartphone
that has this ian con once
an LCD on the other the company is
called eating for some reason we already
know what that is and they already
boasted that they have one customer
which could be amazon actually but this
leads me to the question of the day
would you want to have a smartphone with
two screens like this would you read
books on the other eating side of the
smartphone and not worry of breaking
that screen leave us a comment down
below now if you want an earlier school
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on parking now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Matt Rivera thanks
