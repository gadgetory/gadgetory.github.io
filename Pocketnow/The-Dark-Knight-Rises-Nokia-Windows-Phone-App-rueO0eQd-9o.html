calm and I thought it'd be fun to show
you some of the Dark Knight Rises a
Batman custom features well it's just
one app that Nokia is made for their
Dark Knight Batman themed Windows Phones
so first off I have a new lock screen
here and that's pretty cool and we'll
show you swiping up I already have the
app running so the first up is the
showcase so we have movie trailers
we have Batman wallpaper we have a
ringtone so all these are free stuff to
get a free ringtone you can hear it and
from this little menu can you set it as
a ringtone right there and we have a
free wallpaper but that's kind of boring
stuff there's something really cool here
it's a interesting game this is a so
there's a map of near where I am if I
tap the map it's gonna load some
locations nearby I got a list I can
choose a different location and this is
all powered by Foursquare and here's
Starbucks so I'm gonna claim that as
mine and I get some points for that and
down here I can boost the fence and
defend the location because other people
may attack it so it's kind of like a
tower defense type game but it uses
real-life locations which is interesting
it's back on the map I can only claim
locations that I'm physically near so
there's no real cheating here
okay and if I want to attack something I
have to be physically near it apparently
there's also the scan which is kind of
like the nokia lens and if I point it in
different directions it's gonna show
different locations you can see that
kinda hard to show from here so that is
extremely cool and right here we have
the leader board so we can see who has
the most points and when he first set
this up you can choose to be Batman the
good guys or Bane the bad guys and we
can see whose friends are playing and
who's nearby now over here as you're
playing that game you may happen to win
a lot of points and also rewards so here
are a few rewards that one that's a
ringtone
another ringtone and again I have the
button to set as a ringtone real easily
we've also won a couple new wallpapers
there's one that's pretty nice and down
here is more I have a Catwoman wallpaper
so I've won those by gaining points in
the Gotham City game and here's some
tasks that are listed that you can win
more stuff and here are my locations
that are claimed and next we have a
theatres tab shows our countdown to the
movie premiere and you can locate
theaters nearby and then there's the
info panel we can see what Twitter is
saying about Dark Knight Rises as your
general information casts and links to
other apps with more information so
that's a lot of interesting useful stuff
and a fun game in the Dark Knight Rises
app from Nokia for Windows Phone this is
available on any Nokia Windows Phone so
if you liked this video give us a thumbs
up and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
