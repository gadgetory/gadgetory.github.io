packing.com and today I'm going to show
you urban horizon and what this program
is going to do is turn your gps enabled
phone into a gps navigation system an
urban horizon works with or without a
data connection and you can store the
maps directly to your storage card so
we'll just go into this as you can see
it will check for updates as is up to
date and when you hear that little sound
that means it is up to date and it will
start the program so of course it says
do not operate while driving but we're
just going to okay and we give you your
current position and the cool thing
about this feature is you can change
between 3d and 2d and I'll show you a
little more on that when we're done so
if you want to go somewhere let's say we
just want to scroll and we can just pick
any position we can select that position
by holding down our stylist or our
finger it works is very finger-friendly
senior thing I'm just using the stylus
for demonstrational purposes and we can
either route to clear make it our home
or add to favorites so if want to route
to this position I can just go to there
and we'll begin routing
turn right onto so from here we'll start
routing and this is just the demo mode
as you can see it's here it's actually
pretty your monitor selfies it'll tell
you all the names of the roads as well
as the distances so I'm just gonna stop
this routing right here and we'll go
into some of the features so you can
select a home so if you have a home
address you can click on that and you
need to select it on the map or input to
address yourself you can go to your
favorites so I have a couple favorites
here as you can see we can route to any
of these so if i click on here i can
click view and i can either call them
it'll save their phone number as well as
give their address you neither call them
route 2 or go to so if i wanted to go to
that place i could or route to that
place I came as well so we'll just go
back we'll go into some of the history
it saves all your history so that's a
very nice feature I use that feature a
lot on other navigational programs so
this is a great feature to have we can
just go back the same same concept as
before we can do it and just call them
as well we can also search so it gives
us a couple options we can search for
address so if we need to type in the
address we can it's pretty finger
friendly but not nearly as great as some
other programs you can also go two
points of interest and type in a name or
we can just get coordinates so if i
needed a GPS coordinate that I want to
get to I can do that as well and go
nearby this will give us a list of
points of interest that are close to our
area so I've wanted to go shopping I can
look here and look for something that's
pretty close and so I wanted to go to
the cutting edge home theater I can do
that we can just go back we can go into
our route information so if we wanted to
continue on a route we can do that we
can see all of our information on
turn-by-turn directions as well as how
far we can go straight and how close we
are to our destination we can minimize
the program so it'll just it'll still
run in the background but we can just go
back into the program
and you can go into some of the settings
so we have the system settings and we
can change the time and we can also sync
with UTC which means that'll give us our
correct time from the satellites so like
a atomic time you can change from
12-hour mode and get our sound settings
so if you wanted to make it a little bit
quieter which is pretty loud right now I
can do that as well as needed it can
change the display orientation so I've
wanted to change it to 90 degrees I can
do that or change it back it'll all go
up to a 270 degrees so you can have it
turned exactly this the opposite way
that you want as well as it gives you a
battery meter and going to the advanced
we can change the labels on if you saw
on our dashboard we have these dashboard
settings so we can change the labels
from our speed to our route distance a
route ETA and we can change our control
mode in that I'll show you that in just
a second can also show our battery meter
show gps status and network status which
is the little bar at the top that keeps
showing what connections I have through
my Wi-Fi and through m-my hsdpa
connection can also change the structure
so we can see structures and I'll show
you that so it says transparent or solid
I changed it to all the way solid i'll
show you that in just a couple seconds
as well as landmarks and I have mine set
for quality opposed to speed because I
just want it to look nice right now
can also change route settings so I'm in
the United States so I wanted to change
it to miles per hour this program will
work in Canada as well and we can also
save our GPS log so if you wanted to
retrack one of our trips we can do that
it's pretty simple just a recording a
router settings so this is how once you
change it to either fast or shortest you
can do that you can avoid toll roads
which is a pretty nice feature because
some navigational programs don't allow
you to do that which I personally do not
like to pay toll roads so I would always
select that button and for the guidance
settings this will give you your
distance as well as or the time so
depending on what the voice says you can
change that on here so let's go back and
we can also go to our user information
this is our network settings right here
and it will also give you your
registration ID and our GPS information
so if you want to see which satellites
were connected to right now and we're
just going to the amount of information
and it gives you a long list of
information about the program okay so
from here I might actually get go to one
of my favorites and I selected a
favorite I'm just going to go to Broad
Street we'll go there so here it will
direct us to Broad Street which is
Seattle give this are the GPS position
as well as a little description but
there's not too much to say about broad
street just close that and this program
has one feature that I have never seen
on any other program that's been
released yet in that is a 3d mapping
system that actually shows you buildings
as well as landmarks so we'll just let
some load here if you can see this
building right here is actually the
Space Needle and we can change it with
our little joystick which is very nice
so if we scroll over we can see that
it's the space needle and they'll be
transparent for a second until they
solidify we can turn the directional pad
all the way around as well as go into
the atmosphere so that's nice you can
zoom out and see the rest of the city it
does take a little bit of time to load
the buildings but it is rather worth it
if you are the type of person that gets
lost easily it's very nice to have
landmarks as well as buildings to see
where
heading urban horizon will run on nearly
all windows mobile 5 and greater devices
points of interest our updated from
teleatlas and updates are free which
some mapping software such as garmin
they charge you a like per year so if
you wanted to up to grade the maps on
garmin it you'd have to buy the new maps
every year the program is priced from
free for a 14-day trial and it goes all
the way up to 59 99 for a year
subscription and this is a service based
program but it's a lot cheaper than if
you were to use like 80s navigator and
be about half the cost if you bought it
your subscription and as you can see
this is the wvga version it's not quite
available yet to the general public but
I've talked to the developer so
hopefully it will be implemented for
testing on other devices and i'll post a
link of pocketnow.com so how to get this
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
