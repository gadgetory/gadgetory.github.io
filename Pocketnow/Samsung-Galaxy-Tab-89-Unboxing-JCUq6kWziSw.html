pocketnow.com Samsung is trying to make
a tablet for everyone in four different
sizes
unlike the guys at Apple and Motorola
who are sticking with just one size at
the moment the Galaxy Tab 8.9 was just
announced has actually announced a long
time ago at CTIA but the u.s.
availability was announced just recently
it'll be available at Best Buy and other
retailers four hundred and sixty nine
dollars for the 16 gigabyte version $100
more with double storage to 32 gigabytes
in this video we're going to talk about
first impressions the Galaxy Tab 8.9 so
this is a really interesting size it's
kind of an in-between size between the
Samsung 7-inch tablets which a lot of
people love further portability and
their 10-inch tablet or 10.1 to be exact
with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 a really
interesting size kind of in the middle
really gives people another choice when
they're going with a tablet this is
running with the Tegra 2 processor the
one that we've seen for a while now each
core is clocking in at one gigahertz
it's got a one gig it's got one gigabyte
of RAM and a screen that is 1280 by 800
so higher resolution than we've seen
with previous tablets running Android
higher resolution than the iPad still
not that high resolution and when you
really think about it you can playback
720p video on this you can't go to 1080p
2012 will probably be the year of 1080p
tablets which will be awesome so I've
actually already unboxed this one where
to talk about first impressions in just
a minute as a hint it is really thin in
fact Samsung calls it the thinnest
tablet that you can get right now and we
would definitely agree with that
a few things of note here we've got the
TouchWiz UX which is Samsung's
proprietary TouchWiz interface we've got
Samsung's meat media hub just a way to
get content download movies onto your
device and also music although there are
a lot of other ways you can get movies
and music onto your phone you can
download netflix you can use Spotify a
lot of different methods of course you
can just use Google Market to download
movies I've got Adobe Flash sure
widescreen viewing this is a 6
by 9 aspect ratio tablet it's got a B G
and n Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth and in
here we've got a tiny little us plug
here of course we've got Samsung's
proprietary Jack microUSB just doesn't
have enough current to charge a tablet
which is why all these tablets that are
out right now require a proprietary Jack
it's very unfortunate because for a
while we were going towards
standardization everything had in
microUSB and now everything's got
proprietary when it comes to tablets so
we've got some health and safety guides
and some earbuds which is a nice little
addition Samsung branded earbuds let's
get this out of the way and talk about
the Galaxy Tab 8.9 now if you've ever
played with the 10.1 or have seen it at
a store a friend using it or even if you
own it this is very similar it's almost
the same thing
it's extremely lightweight under one
pound and it's also very plasticky
feeling which is how they get it to be
so lightweight so it's very thin let's
look around the device to turn around on
the back on the back we have what
appears to be brushed metal which would
be awesome but it's actually plastic so
you can hear it's just plastic that's
how they get the lightweight but a
really nice design it's not conducive to
picking up fingerprints as you can see
it keeps quite clean it's got a three
megapixel camera up here with an LED
flash which is a nice touch we've got
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack at the
top volume rocker power samsung logo on
the bottom we've got dual stereo
speakers here we've got the proprietary
jack for syncing and charging but
hopefully you're not sinking your tablet
you're doing everything over-the-air
nothing on the side this is under 9
millimeters thick extremely thin camera
just went out of focus there because
it's so thin probably and nothing on the
other side as a comparison here is the
galaxy s2 which at its thickest point is
pretty much the same size as the entire
Galaxy Tab 8.9 we've got a 2 megapixel
camera up on the front for video chat
and let's turn this on and talk about a
little bit about the touch UX interface
TouchWiz UX interface and here we are in
honeycomb 3.2 Android 3.2 with TouchWiz
UX on top these two widgets and
and this widget came right out of the
Samsung interface so if we go over here
to the plus icon he got a sense for some
of these widgets that Samsung is
included like the gallery these other
ones are honeycomb swipe active
applications that will show you your
program monitor and social hub and Yahoo
Finance so Samsung adds a bunch of
things to really outfit you with a bunch
of widgets that make sense for your
application of course we've got the
standard built-in app tray here and
we're going to talk a lot more about
this Samsung has brought forth a lot of
really cool touches for example if you
go to the notification tray you get a
quick toggle of all of your system
toggle switches and that's very
reminiscent or exactly the same as you
get here in the Galaxy s2
same kind of thing Samsung sort of
bringing over various elements from
their other products so that there's
some consistency across Samsung products
which is quite cool we've also got this
really cool function down here which
will bring up these hover apps so if you
are in the browser for example or let's
say you're in the Android Market you can
actually keep the calculator on the
screen while you're doing whatever
you're doing and this will always stay
on the screen you can move it around so
imagine being in your email application
you just want to pop up a calculator
real quick without actually leaving your
email app this is a perfect way to do it
the same goes for calendar test manager
world clock pen memo and music player so
a handful of really cool integrations
here that Samsung put forth in the
Galaxy Tab 8.9 they're very similar or
really the same to what you get in the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 but everything is a
little bit smaller the Galaxy Tab 8.9 is
not the sigh a size where you can hold
it with one hand it's still kind of big
it's not like the 7-inch tablets where
you can actually literally fit it into
your pocket
the 8.9 is a little too big for that and
as you can see kind of a fingerprint
magnet but what tablet isn't so we've
got a lot more coming up in the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 8.9 let us know what you
think about this particular size is it a
little too small a little too big
let us know in the comments and please
give us a thumbs up if you liked the
video thanks for watching
