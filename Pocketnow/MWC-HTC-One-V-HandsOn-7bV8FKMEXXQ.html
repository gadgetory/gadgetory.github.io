from walking out on Khan we've got Brian
here who's going to give this a quick
demo of the HTC One V which we've had a
hard time trying to find because there's
not a working unit out there the problem
is the experience is not ready for this
phone yet it's ready for the other phone
so we're going to get a quick hard work
of Harrison mark but the other 1s 1x
devices and then tell us more about
specs it everything ok hey I'm putting
in an order here yet so you have the V
so the actual one experience that we
created HTC blends itself across all of
these from a sling for you though we
have in the one v is a single core
processor
you have this lovely design process of
appointing there so it's basically
leveraging the DNA that we've already
used is similar products like the arrow
so in the legend the whole unit
bodybuilder database so it's made out
one whole piece of aluminium precision
cool so you've got device actually feels
like it should be in that real real top
and a premium feel so you have a five
megapixel camera just a sh k plus u 2
720p HD video joined by the LED flash
you'll notice at the bottom there as
well that you have the beats all your
simple meaning the fact that will
actually incorporate the Beats Audio
technology the software inside of this
device which is open for you to play
across a multitude of different programs
so whether that be your favorite
playlist will be your
your normal music playlist or video
streaming youtube also little design
accent by the little micro machine holes
there's no septic cars the speaker
grills there's no flexing storage for
free starts biting through
you also noticed well that you have the
capacity to touch buttons on the bottom
so you have the back arrow on the home
button and you also have a recent output
which we found have been very very
helpful when navigating around ice cream
sandwich which this will be running on
including sense for the whole one so far
the device I mean looking at it the
design feels definitely metallic it
feels very not light it's actually it
doesn't feel cheap in the hand even
though it's obviously about entry levels
of ice this is pretty much an entry
level one device for everybody and then
these are the high-end phones but you
know it reminds you of the legend a lot
the legend is a phone that we loved a
lot in our review years ago here's a
beautiful device so far we have a lot of
expectations for this product with this
being a sort of an antenna was the
fixture here at the top by which pop we
just wanted a small design though this
small design a spur gear that scratch
here I am kind of unusually high just
like components in yeah well yeah okay
speaker grill at the top this iron
component of the power on button 3.5
millimeter headphone jack we don't have
a front facing camera on this phone
the camera but what do you have on this
is the gorilla glass okay and it's also
a super lcd2 the screen I'll interesting
thank you we've got five megapixel
camera the bag LED flash volume rocker
at the bottom then we've got the speaker
grill microphone capacitive buttons as
he was mentioning know sort of beat that
and we've got micro is micro USB for
connection no expansion yes that is
fundable member on this one so have the
range of the morning products this one
is expandable for you okay can we pull
this out sadly not on this unit but so
far even though we've got the flagship
1x we've got the beautiful witness and
then we've got the one be you know it's
your choice it depends on your needs so
far I think HTC it's got a really good
line it got really good contenders
coming let's see what they come up with
once they move their Lisa phones I see
you something to eat everything
obviously parcours an option dual-core
LC is another option to be your thing
thank you very much the time every
minute thank you Brian very much
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
