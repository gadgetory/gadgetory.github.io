pocketnow.com
and in this video we're going to take a
look at the really cool and interesting
features of the samsung omnia i 900
samsung has done a lot with this device
to make it different than any other
windows mobile phone on the market right
now okay so let's get started
Samsung has included this new widget
based today's screen and these widgets
can be moved around and you can add more
widgets through the panel on the side
here you can also kind of flick your
finger and scroll through them if you
want to hide the widgets you press this
arrow button and they go away let me
take you through some of these widgets
up here at the top we have time zones so
we can see time and you know eastern US
and Pacific us going to the next one we
have FM radio control but you have to
have your headphones connected this ones
can be to have it's your profile
switcher if you want to change it to
vibrate or have the volume off we also
have a analog clock and you can actually
overlap widgets on top of other ones so
that's kind of kind of cool here we have
a calendar but unfortunately the
calendar doesn't show you your next
appointment as does the standard Windows
Mobile today's screen so the only way to
tell what your next appointment is is
actually by clicking on the calendar
which will open up your full calendar
application I wish there was another way
to see the next calendar going down the
list we have a photo looks like I have a
voicemail and dismiss that your photo
viewer so you can flip through any
photos that you have on your device and
there's only one on my omnia right now
so I'm going to bring it back to the
side going down the list we have a link
to the games menu which is kind of silly
because it only comes with two games and
that's it the standard Windows Mobile
games and finally on the bottom here
well there's actually one more I'll show
you after this this just shows you your
current operator I'm using this on AT&amp;amp;T
and this one is play controls for the
mp3 player and I'm going to go through
that further in detail in a little bit
and this is the notification widget
which is probably the most useful of all
these widgets it tells you if you have a
new text message or a missed call or new
email and if you have more than one sort
of notification to be displayed you can
toggle between them through these
buttons here
and if you want to you know accept the
notification and make it go back to
default you press the X and it tells you
you have no notifications the
notifications with this I now if you
have a keen eye you've probably noticed
this arrow on the screen this is another
way that you can interact with your
device actually with one hand what you
do is you slide your finger around on
this optical joystick and the mouse
moves around on the screen I find this
to be a good way to navigate the device
and to keep some smudges off of the
screen since it's so fingerprint prone
so I really enjoy using that and you're
going to be seeing me use that a lot
through this demonstration if you don't
want to use the optical joystick you can
turn off the mouse pointer now in the
bottom right corner here we have
Samsung's application launcher which
lets you launch applications and
programs that you may be using on a
regular basis or if you want to add your
own shortcuts you go to the next menu
here where it says shortcuts and you can
go to edit and you can click and drag
these icons around to kind of configure
them to the way that you want them to
look so that may be useful to you maybe
not it's good to have though so I'm
gonna click OK and go back to the Today
screen ok now I'm going to go into the
Start menu and I'm going to pick the
phone up and use the joystick to get to
that now the omnia has an accelerometer
like the touch diamond but unlike the
touch diamond you can use the
accelerometers functionality in a lot of
different screens pretty much anywhere
in the operating system so if I turn it
over you get this little animation right
and you can actually turn it to the
other way too now this animation is
indeed a little bit annoying but what it
does is it buys the device a little bit
of time because as you know to rotate
the screen in Windows Mobile takes a few
seconds so I'm going to leave it on
portrait for now there we are and you
can actually set the sensitivity of the
accelerometer I'll show you that in a
little bit so let's look at the programs
there's a lot of programs included on
here I'm not going to go through all of
them I'll cover everything in the review
something that I've noticed that's
really annoying is that you can't flick
scroll the programs this is supposed to
be a very touch friendly device and you
have to use the scroll bar throughout
the operating system
are in in most of the operating system
if you want to get through a list that's
unfortunate so let's take a look at some
of these applications we've camera the
camera interface is fantastic I'll talk
about that in the review we have FM
radio we have this program called Google
launcher which is kind of pointless it's
it's basically google's homepage so if i
search for something right now it'll
take me to google.com and pocket
internet explorer it gives you a link to
mail Gmail so if you use Gmail a lot
that may be a quicker way to get there
going down the list we have an RSS
reader a podcast player streaming player
which will allow you to view YouTube
video videos on the omnia so you can go
to my YouTube calm we have TV out viewer
and unfortunately the version of the
Samsung omnia that I got did not come
with a adapter to use the TV out
functionality word is that future models
especially if it comes to the US will
include that adapter we have this thing
here called the touch player which is
pretty neat so you can play songs you
have a kind of touch friendly interface
that actually lets you flick scroll this
is one of the few places in the in the
omnia where you can flick scroll and
what's neat about the touch player is
that it integrates with this if if I'm
playing a song can I pause it and I want
to go do something else and then I want
to play the song again without going
into the touch player watch this okay I
just flicked my finger from the bottom
to the top and I get play controls for
the mp3 player let me do that again so I
can I can play the song and also I get
this task switcher which is kind of like
the windows alt tab menu so I can switch
between a program and go right to file
explorer for example so that's pretty
useful and also from this task menu you
can end all tasks if you want to get
back some of your speed on your device
now because pocket internet explorer is
still horrible even in windows mobile
6.1 which lets you zoom out on webpages
samsung has included a full version of
opera 9.5 the acclaimed browser that
people are saying is better than mobile
safari on the iphone so i'm not going to
really show you a demonstration of opera
mobile right now but it works
really well in the omnia and of course
it works with the accelerometer so you
can flip around to landscape at any time
the device also comes with Word Excel
PowerPoint OneNote 2007 so you can view
all that those documents on the phone
now I want to go into the settings menu
because there's some interesting things
in there that I want to show you ok now
in the settings menu we have this thing
called vibe tones and what it will do if
you turn it on is every time you hit a
button you'll get a little vibration
some LG devices on Verizon I know have
this they try to give you a little bit
of tactile feedback but I think it's
really a silly waste of battery life the
vibration is slightly delayed it really
doesn't give me the sense that I'm
actually touching a button I think it's
a novelty but you may think it to be
different you may find some use from the
vibration mode we have a menu for DivX
here this is the first Windows mobile
device that is DivX certified we also
have themes Samsung lets you customize
the device with a few different color
choices which is good because a lot of
devices don't let you go beyond the
standard green and red and blue so we
can flip down the list get a purple or a
grey and it'll show you a little preview
and you can hit OK up here everything
will turn gray
obviously so let's move on to system
we've got some things in here I want to
talk about we have settings for the
finger Mouse so you can either have it
turned on or if you turn it off this
becomes just a standard d-pad down here
and you can do you know up down right
and left you can also adjust the
sensitivity of the finger Mouse right
now I have it set on fast so that you
know I don't have to stroke my finger
that many times on the sensor to get it
to move around the screen so that is
that we have enhanced GPS which is the a
GPS which will download information so
that you can get a quicker GPS fix I
found the omnia to get a GPX fix in 10
to 15 seconds in Google Maps now here we
have some settings for the motion sensor
so we can set the sensitivity of how
easily a tilt of the device will make it
flip into the other screen orientate
so right now I have it set almost too
low because when I'm moving around
sometimes I tend to shake the device and
I don't want it to flip into landscape
and then it has a cool feature called
etiquette etiquette pause which is like
on the HTC diamond when you get a call
in and you want to silence the call you
can flip over the phone and it stops
ringing let me show you an example of
that now I'm going to call my phone and
you should hear it ring in a second okay
that goes turn over the phone and I turn
it back over pretty neat huh it's a
pretty cool feature that makes a mix it
makes a big difference especially when
you're out at a bar or out at a
restaurant and you want to flip it over
so that you know the phone doesn't keep
ringing off the hook so let's move on to
memory so here we have right now 46
megabytes of free program memory let me
zoom in a little bit more so you can see
that and storage we have 36 point 5
megabytes now if you're wondering where
all the 16 gigabytes of storage is shown
you have to go to the storage card tab
down here which shows you that in my
storage it almost acts as its own
storage card we have free 15 thousand
megabytes which is 15 gigabytes and of
course if you have a storage card
inserted into the device if you want
additional storage it'll show up here as
well ok now I want to show you the
keyboard options on the Omni let me zoom
out a little bit I'm going to go into
office and then I'll open up word new
and this is the first keyboard it's a
shirt type keyboard is found on the
t-mobile shadow on the blackberry pearl
and it works pretty well so I'm going to
type the quick brown fox and I haven't
had much practice with this quick brown
fox and it has word completion so it
does pretty well and like the iPhone you
can slide your finger around on the keys
and it only registers the key when you
release your finger so let me kind of
delete all that and show you the other
keyboard
the next one is the full QWERTY keyboard
and each key is kind of tall so it gives
you a lot of space to work with so I'm
again I'm going to do the quick brown
fox see how I did and I'd almost got it
close enough
finally we have a t9 style pad it's
called the phone pad
these buttons are quite large so those
with large fingers would probably prefer
using this and if you can get that and
focus here at the quick brown so it did
pretty well in accuracy for this one so
overall I think Samsung did a pretty
good job with the omnia eye 900 I like
how you can use the device with one hand
with the optical joystick here it has a
good sense of control and accuracy I
like how you can use the accelerometer
in in more than just one place in the
operating system and you know the widget
interface is kind of interesting
I wish Samsung had included some more
useful widgets for example stocks or
weather or even a calendar plugin and
let you see your next appointment I'm
probably going to revert back to the
standard Windows Mobile today's screen
because this really serves no purpose
for me having these lots of different
ways to tell the time so that is it for
the Samsung omnia I'm going to cover
everything info on the pocketnow.com
review coming up in a few days we'll do
benchmarks on the device take pictures
of every angle and show you every piece
of software that this comes with that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
