started covering leaks of the galaxy s
10 I just checked our script log and we
began on February 8th 2018 exactly one
year ago and it's understandable the
Samsung Galaxy lineup has dominated the
Android space since day one and now that
we're just a couple of weeks away from
unpacked it's only fair that we grab all
those leaks and line them up into one
video I'm home it'll be better with
pocket now when this is our room around
above the Galaxy S 10 we've heard of up
to five different Galaxy S 10 variants
to be announced and we'll probably see
them all at unpacked or we'll just get
some announced than the others announced
later some of these with 5g capabilities
another some sort of special edition
that will be crazy expensive we're gonna
focus on what we expect to see at
Samsung's Galaxy unpacked and take it
from there
On January 18 2019 famous tipster Evan
blast tweeted leaked renders from case
makers showing only three devices to
look forward to and then on February 4th
2019 we saw reports that match the
claims
now with the FCC certifying only three
devices the smaller galaxy s10 II the
more mainstream Galaxy S 10 and the top
flagship the galaxy s 10 plus most of
these leaks fall in line with video
renders that emerge more than two months
ago from 91 mobiles and the design is
pretty much now verified by dummy units
that mkbhd recently featured in a video
says this is a line of these devices are
rumored to have a lot in common like
glass on glass builds with aluminum a
horizontal Center design for the camera
at the back and a new punch hole
infinity Oh for the selfie camera or
cameras at the top right and nearly
bezel is Super AMOLED displays at quad
HD plus resolution that only seemed
asymmetrical with the corners in the
minor chin at the bottom
all units seem to be powered by the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 or the Exynos 98
xx Ram starts at 6 ago bytes and storage
at 128 expandable they all bring a
headphone jack ip68 water and dust
resistance fast charging through USB C
fast wireless charging that might be
reversible to charge a rumoured
wireless earbuds and we even hear that
cryptocurrencies will make it to Samsung
pay yeah in addition we also hear that
the primary camera will be the same
across all devices 12 megapixels with
variable aperture between F 1.5 and F
2.4 will discuss the other cameras as we
go through the differences of each
device when you eye is also being said
to be the new primary UI paradigm all
based on Android Pi but with a twist
less gimmicks and the company has
realized that large phones are hard to
use with one hand so it's baked up the
idea that all interaction and navigation
controls should be at the bottom sadly I
can't tell you more about it because
none of my devices have received the 1
UI yet all of them are unlocked let's
begin talking about the differences and
it starts with the samsung galaxy s 10
II which is rumored to be the smaller
variant there's a lot of speculation
over what the e stands for I've heard
economy around there but I honestly
doubt it the price point is being
rumored to be 750 euros which we assume
to be the same number for dollars given
the exchange rate in addition to the
taxation in Europe some rumors claim to
the display on this phone won't be
curved like it's larger siblings the
Super AMOLED panel will be an infinity
Oh with a single 10 megapixel selfie
camera that's finally able to record 4k
video and that five point eight inches
diagonal we also hear of the right side
power button doubling as a fingerprint
scanner aside from the primary camera it
only brings an additional shooter that's
ultra wide at 16 megapixels at F 1.9 and
123 degrees of field of view battery
size is rumored to be of 3000 milliamp
hours now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 which we hear will be
standing in between and the mainstream
device we hear that there will be two
variants one of bass RAM and storage
retailing at a rumored $8.99 and if you
want eight gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of
storage prepare eleven hundred and forty
nine dollars this one has a 6.1 inch
Super AMOLED display that's curved and
brings the same infinity Oh punch hole
and selfie camera as the s10 II and it
will include an ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner made by Qualcomm onto this
aside from the primary and ultra white
cameras we've mentioned it also sports a
13 megapixel telephoto camera at F 2.4
aperture which we assume brings the same
to X optical zoom we've seen in the past
and better support for portrait shots
battery sizes of around 3500 milliamp
hours and then there is the cream of the
crop the larger samsung galaxy s 10 plus
well here of up to 3 variants here
starting at $9.99 for the base ram and
storage 12:49 for a gigs of ram and 512
gigs of storage and a whopping $14.99
for 12 gigs of ram and one terabyte of
storage i didn't even know that there
were 12 gigs of ram as an option but
Samsung did make their 1 terabytes of
storage official recently in addition we
also hear that the higher tier variant
might even include a ceramic back which
is awesome we hear this phone will be
less than 8 millimeters thick all the
while bringing a large 4100 milliamp
hour battery
we might get a taller six point four
inch curved Super AMOLED panel and the
same on display fingerprint scanner of
the Galaxy S 10 now the rumors are that
we're getting up to five cameras yes two
at the front with a wider infinity Oak
cutout one with 10 megapixels and the
other with a depth sensor and then the
same triple camera array that we hear
from the galaxy s 10 and then there's
the bonus round because just like in the
previous unpack we might get things that
are not necessarily being rumored or
confirmed for this event one of them
being 5g we hear that one of the galaxy
s 10 variants will include this but
might not necessarily be shown off at
unpacked or probably will only be teased
now this phone might bring some
differences because in order to
accommodate the RF and Tenace four
millimeter wave in 5g there might be
some design differences in the antenna
bands we'll see about that
the second rumors are already strong on
the galaxy watch active it seems that
the rotating bezel is no more with three
color variants a 1.3 inch display and
just an overall smaller footprint than
the Galaxy watch in order to make
training more enjoyable last but not
least what's up with the samsung galaxy
f on January 29th DJ Co came on record
to state that both the galaxy s 10 and
the foldable product
we'll meet expectations thing is we're
still trying to figure out what problems
this product will solve and what we will
see it unpacked as so far it's only
vaguely been shown off at their
developer conference rumors claim that
this might also be the last event by the
Jayco so it will definitely be a
memorable one I've actually really
enjoyed his tenure as being in charge of
the mobile department but of course this
is what we know now I know that rumors
and leaks will only get more intense as
we get closer to galaxy unpacked so make
sure you keep it locked to the pocket
out daily as we're covering rumors
everyday and then we will also be along
with Joshua Vergara covering the
unpacked event from San Francisco let us
know what you're expecting from galaxy
unpacked what things do you think will
happen what things you think won't and
while you're at it make sure you follow
us on social media subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one it follow me
