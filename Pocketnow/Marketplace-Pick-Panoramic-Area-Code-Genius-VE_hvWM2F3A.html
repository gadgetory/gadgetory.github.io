park.com and if you ever received a
phone call from an unknown area code
you've always wondered where is this
phone call coming from well anyways
today I'm going to show you a program
called panoramic area code and what this
program allows you to do is actually
search for any country code or area code
in the United States or around the world
so let me begin by showing you a country
code so if I wanted to see what the
country code in the United States is I
can just go here to list and I can just
scroll down quickly down to the use as
you can see I'm already on the use here
so the United States is code 1 and
United Kingdom is code 44 and it
continues through almost every country
in the entire world so that's pretty
cool then just click ok so let's say I
got a phone call from a weird area code
but I didn't know where it was from so
all I have to do is click on North
America and search for let's say it was
604 and then just click locate and we'll
actually find the local time and it says
that if this is British Columbia in
Canada actually and it shows the
language the capital the Canadian
currency which is canadian dollar the
population so i'll just go back if i
want to search for another area code
let's say i got a phone call from 21 to
locate that and that's New York local
time there in coarse language capital
and go back again ok so if i wanted to
call a phone number but i don't know the
area code I can also click on list for
north america and find the area code by
the state so let's say I wanted to find
one for Hawaii
I Hawaii is 808 so that's pretty simple
if I click on here it'll actually give
me a little information about the state
as well we'll just click back so let's
say I want to find a country code for
Germany because I have a friend over
there let's see go to world and go to
list go down to Germany and it is 49 so
that's also pretty simple it's kind of
cool it gives you a little flag as well
and click OK and it would give us the
information on that country as well so
this is panoramic haricots genius and
the program is actually free and this is
another marketplace pick where we pick
some helpful and interesting
applications on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
