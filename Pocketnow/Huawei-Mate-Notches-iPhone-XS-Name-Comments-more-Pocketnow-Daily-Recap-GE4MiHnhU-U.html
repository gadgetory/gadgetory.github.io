Book of World Records for most memorable
name yeah
what would I win hey Diego picked this
comment pick it pick it I said
ticket you can I know and they will fell
for it
who the hell hates high metal even after
saying his name it sounds godly that is
exactly what my mother said because that
was my dad's name and that just became
awkward they asked you how are you just
to say that you're fine when you're not
really fine but you just can't get into
it because they would never understand
that's right it's that time of the week
I am I'm editing that I this is
PocketNow
and this is the party now daily recap of
your comments for last week so one
Monday the topic was the huawei mate 20
Pro it was spotted at Aoife I am looking
forward to that phone a lot but I asked
you like what do you think about the
leaked images and everything we had 248
comments Huawei took an L yeah they I
guess they did applause for change
definitely I have to save this is the
final design that whole boxy camera case
in the back I have to say like it's
really cool it looks modern unique and
it doesn't look like the protruding
cameras that we see from iDevices looks
like wall-e alright seriously but if you
think about it it's a pleasant image I
mean I can tell you so many cases of
products that have been designed to
mimic something like for example Mazda
using the front of their cars to mimic a
smile in the back of their car so that
makes somebody with a badass face it has
a purpose so yeah I feel that
skeuomorphism to a certain degree plays
a good deal here on Tuesday the topic
was a foldable smartphone Samsung CEO
pretty much teased that they're working
on a foldable device for this year and I
asked you what did you think about
possible future of this we had 350
comments pretty sure jerry-rigged
everything we'll enjoy the best test of
a foldable scream though
oh my god I will definitely be looking
forward to Zak's video on this I don't
know about you let me know in the
comments what do you like more about his
videos do you like him just tearing up
products or his jokes because for me
it's the combination of both I feel that
the guy is a genius
you know what I'd love for Samsung to
deliver timely Android software updates
oh my god can you imagine if they take
so long with the note line up with the
excuse of the s-pen what will they take
now with a foldable phone I have mixed
feelings about foldable screens are they
going to be durable perform well and
with the software and content available
place nice with them all right from the
rumors that I've seen this looks more
like what we've seen from ZT with the X
on em that implementation was not good
so I am just as concerned but then again
Samsung has proven that they know how to
make extra layers of software / user
interfaces like what we've seen index
for example or what we've seen for
example in the galaxy note with the
s-pen interaction so I'm kind of
confident that Samsung would be the best
company for this job then on Wednesday
we had not seen the iPhone 10s yet it
wasn't yet announced I asked you what
did you think about the possibility of
iPhones being the first with a 7
nanometer process that was being rumored
back then we had 420 comments one small
step of innovation one giant leap for
iPhone price well in the end the price
ended up the same which you know I hate
because the rumors were that the price
was going to drop and I hate for a
Cupertino to be figuring out ways to
justify the same price tag 7 nanometer
processor for iPhone users to check
Instagram lol I have to say yes but then
again that is like the average consumer
we have to praise Apple for the
performance of their chips they've been
doing an amazing job since the iPhone 5s
I believe ever since they came up with
the first 64 64 bit processor yeah that
was that's what we got from them so I
don't know man we'll see what they come
up with I'm really looking forward to
that chip on iPads
sebin an ohmmeter processor or not
people are going to buy the newest
iPhone because its software is gonna run
virtually sliema
seamlessly on it that's the thing I mean
the software runs seamlessly regardless
of its 40
ten nanometer again that's another thing
we have to praise apple on regardless of
their software is better than others
honestly I don't care as long as it
works I do consider Android to be
superior but what's the point if it
plays hit or miss depending on what
hardware is being included and then on
Thursday the rumors were the possible
names of iPhones of the 10s 10s max it
ended up being true these were the final
names in the end then I asked you what
do you think about them we had 388
comments over the last few days Highness
said iPhone names more than his own um
let me finish reading the comment over
the last few days Hymas said the iPhone
names more than his own on my phone
Lavetta thank you very much for watching
all right why deny was a good one
Tim Cook is potentially killing Apple's
history for having clean product names
or is he oh my god the sarcasm was
strong on this one but I do have to
agree even though he's doing the
opposite with iPads which is the reason
why I thought that the less expensive
iPhone was just gonna be called iPhone
they say that Apple keeps everything
very simple but these names are more
complex than those of Xiaomi definitely
I don't know what Apple's naming scheme
is like seriously and then we use Roman
numerals but then that one we're
supposed to be calling a number but then
the other one which is a letter we're
supposed to assume it's not a Roman
numeral it's it's the worst like
seriously
and then finally Friday the topic was
the huawei mate 20 and May 20 Pro again
we saw some leaked images of a larger
and a smaller notch with the pro having
the larger notch and I asked you what
did you think about this we had 500
comments Huawei mate 20 Pro equal the
next camera phone purchase oh my god so
I just spent some time in San Francisco
and just give you an idea I ended up
using the Oppo find X as my primary
phone because I'm doing that review I
was also using the note 9 and guess what
I was using the p20 Pro as my camera not
saying that these other phones don't
have great cameras they're just not
great enough to compare to the p20 Pro
so yeah
I agree I'm okay with the big notch but
it must
have a bigger screen you know I we go
back to the same topic people hate me
for saying that I don't care about
notches I care about bezels I would
rather put up with notches than with
bezels so I have to agree with you on
this one too I go for the teardrop notch
you know ever since OPO came up with
that design on the f9 which is another
phone that I have to review that's right
there hue ting for me um I like this
teardrop design like for me it's it's so
uninteresting over a little portion of
the notification tray
ever since well it's actually not even
nope oh it was essential I love this
design I don't mind those kind of
notches
I wonder exactly why we always bring a
larger notch on the pro but then again
these are just rumors we'll see what we
get that's it for the pocket out daily
