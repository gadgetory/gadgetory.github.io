Motorola's new droid razr lineup gets
official and why oh why is no key using
misleading marketing I'm Hyman Rivera
and to some marketing companies despair
this is parking out daily nokia has just
announced ur new Lumia 920 and 820
windows phones at their new york event
and we were there life to get all the
goods the devices are beautiful they are
powerful and aside from running the
Windows Phone 8 operating system they've
also got some unique features that are
definitely not seen anywhere else like
for example Nokia city lens feature with
augmented reality but sadly as it is
with every Nokia launch we have no dates
no prices no carriers and we've got some
weird marketing that we're going to talk
about in the last segment motor will
also followed with their own events in
new york city where they announced their
new droid razr lineup coming to verizon
we've got the droid razr HD the droid
razr HD max which is a bigger battery on
that same HD end then we've got the
droid razr m which is sort of a mid to
your device the spec sheet is long in
these three devices they're really good
so follow the link in the description
for details but sadly we only got the
official release date for the droid razr
m which is available for pre-order since
yesterday so if you're interested in any
of these keep your wallet waiting now
the mysteriously big HTC smartphone
showed up for blurry cam again and this
time we've got a couple of extra details
that'll probably disappoint first of all
the code name for this device is
endeavor c2 so if you think of it
endeavour was the code name for the HTC
One X secant stand for CDMA and two is
because this is the second city in May
carrier will be launching a variant for
the HTC One X so I rest my case this is
the verizon variant for the HTC One X
and obviously we had the red lines to
talk about it the question is when are
we going to get the phone now Amazon's
event is scheduled to happen today and
guess what it does seem like if we will
be getting a smartphone the trusted
sources can't confirm if during this
event we will be getting a smartphone
aside from the kin
fire tablets that were also rumored but
it does seem like amazon has everything
done for a phone to be announced even
though apparently the phone is not
really finished so make sure you stay
tuned to the news during the day for
details on whatever amazon announces and
let's see what this thing's gonna be
called the Kindle match or what and
finally for the disappointing news of
the day Nokia slapped the PureView name
on their Nokia Lumia 920 just because
they brought optical civilization on the
camera but also because of this ad Nokia
wants to show you just how great that
optical civilization is so they've got
this guy filming his girlfriend on a
bicycle with the Lumia 920 and obviously
we've got a camera crew that's filming
everybody from the outside but then they
focus on the footage from the Lumia 920
supposedly because they want to show you
the difference between optical
stabilization off on the left and then
optical civilization on on the right and
you'll notice that at some point boom
there's this trailer at the back with a
window that's showing off the real thing
it's a guy on a van with a DSLR and the
light filming the girl and not really
the guy on the bicycle as they wanted to
portray Nokia already sent out an
apology for this but sadly you just get
to wonder i mean the Lumia 920 was a
beautiful product on his own optical
civilization on its own was great there
was no need for misleading marketing so
why screw it up so that leads me to the
question of the day are you happy with
Nokia's new fake marketing practice
leave us a comment down below I'm
honestly disappointed now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on parking
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hanging
every better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
