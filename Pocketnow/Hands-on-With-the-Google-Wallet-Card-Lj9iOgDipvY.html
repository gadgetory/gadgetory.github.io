Google Wallet if your phone had NFC if
your carrier supported it if you have
the app installed and configured and if
you could find some place to pay using
your phone you were all set
it sounds like an awful lot of Hoops to
jump through and if you thought that
you're not alone Google did - I'm Joe
Levi for pocket now and this is our
unboxing of the Google Wallet card so
not so much an unboxing as an unfolding
this is just a letter it comes in a
regular envelope a very plain envelope
with no branding on the outside at all
in fact that's why you're not seeing me
cut into the envelope it just came with
my address through a window and that was
pretty much it once we got inside well
then it's just a letter i've redacted
some things here like my name my name is
here but my address and some numbers up
here that i don't know what they were
but they didn't look like an account
number but just in case they were I took
those out of course it tells you all
about your Google Wallet card activate
your card using the app not using the
dial-in 800 number like you would on a
normal debit card and that's what this
is a MasterCard debit card which you'll
see in just a minute
you can spend this anywhere that accepts
MasterCard locations I of course it's
got all of your fraud monitoring all of
that fun stuff that you come to expect
from a credit card or debit card and
then you can get notified of your
purchases and whatnot because it ties in
with your Google Wallet moving down to
the card let's do the michael fisher
peel off here Oh
how does that sound real good okay I've
gone ahead and redacted a few things
right across here's the credit card
number the debit card number the
expiration date and whatnot I've covered
all that up so you can't go and buy
yourself a car off of my card but that's
it that's all it looks like let's go
ahead and take the activation notice
awful see if you can hear that because
so ah tour
how's that for a unstriped fail right
there not much to see up here just
normal stuff very plain very simple kind
of reversed you'd expect to have your
MasterCard logo your hologram stuff your
name on the front all of that is over
here on the back name and card number up
there expiration date of course and your
signature block nice silver bar for you
to to write with so that's that's
essentially it you can see it is a debit
card this is not going to work of course
until I sign it and until I activate it
so let's see what we have to do to
activate the card in the app itself if
you want to get a Google Wallet card the
way you do that is open up Google Wallet
and there will be a card in here at
software card not a physical card that
gives you instructions on what you need
to do to request a card be delivered to
you mine took about four or five days to
get here take a little bit longer if
it's over a weekend or a holiday weekend
like it has been recently next step is
to activate it it says here it has my
card already arrived if so activate it
now go ahead and do that this is what
the back of the card looks like and it's
asking for the last four digits of the
card I'll go ahead and do that off
camera and show you the next step
just as simple as that I went ahead and
I put in those four digits I just got an
email saying that that registration has
been received and on to the next page it
says here you go
I can now spend my wallet balance using
it this card my wallet balance right now
is zero dollars and zero cents but as
soon as I put some money over here I can
go ahead and spend this just like a
would a debit card or a credit card just
it will draw from that balance directly
I can even get cash from ATMs though you
may have to pay a buck-50 ATM fee or
whatnot so make sure you don't get
gouged by that so after that brief
tutorial I hit next and we're good
that's literally what it says and we're
good next step is to add money to the
wallet balance or just say done and in
that case we are done and we are ready
to go that's essentially it Google
Wallet and Google Wallet card there are
certain drawbacks and limitations that
using the Google Wallet app and
even the Google Wallet card still
include such as a new feature or
restriction depending on who you ask
you now have to have a positive balance
in your Google Wallet account to draw
from in the past I was able to use my
phone to just scan and pay and it would
debit directly from my Associated bank
account that appears not to be the case
anymore or something else is going on
that's causing all of my transactions to
decline where the bank account that is
tied to doesn't decline who knows but
the Google Wallet and the Google Wallet
card are now going to use that Google
Wallet funding source so you want to
make sure that you put some money in
there whether that's a good thing or a
bad thing
I don't know but to me it says that
that's just one more card that you're
going to have to carry around in your
wallet the way wallet used to work and
the way I'd like it to continue to work
in the future is for you to select a
funding source that automatically debits
that account whenever you use your
wallet whether that's on your phone or
the Google wallet card obviously you
can't change your funding source using
the card but you can using the app at
least that's the way it used to work why
it doesn't anymore I don't know but by
doing that Google would be able to
liberate our wallets from carrying
around three four five or even more
cards just let us pick which one we want
to use with the app on our phone whether
or not the vendor supports NFC payments
or not no it wasn't a traditional
unboxing like you might have come to
expect from pocket now but hey it's new
it's tech and it works with your
smartphone Android and iOS so if you
liked what you saw why not throw the
video a thumbs up and of course make
sure you have subscribed to our channel

cool stuff whether that smartphones
tablets accessories or who knows what
else you'll be right up to date as soon
