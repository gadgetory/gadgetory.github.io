its way into custom roms I'm Joe Levi
for pocket now this is a first look at
AO KP custom rom running jellybean this
is the latest milestone release of AOKP
the android open king project AOKP has
been around for quite a while but
getting it into jelly bean or jelly bean
into it depending on how you look at it
has taken a little bit of time in fact
we saw the first releases in the early
part of December but it hasn't been
until just recently that we've started
seeing a lot of our favorite AOKP
goodies show up first and foremost we
have themes I don't have any extras to
show you but you can go ahead and apply
themes very quickly and easily to style
up here in your status bar and your
buttons down here again depending on the
theme jumping into rom control we've got
about a okp where you can donate a whole
bunch of guys who have contributed to it
let's get back to some of the settings
now you'll notice these settings looking
a lot different than earlier versions of
AOKP that's because they have rewritten
aokp from the ground up they're still
putting in a whole bunch of things but
we've already got carrier label changing
notification background stuff we can do
all kinds of cool things in here
notification counts that I have turned
on we can change the Alpha value of our
notification bar that's up the top to
make it translucent so you can kind of
see through it a little bit that's not a
good wallpaper to show you but you get
the point go back in here into settings
and into rom control you can change your
lock screen and add a seemingly infinite
number of lock screen widgets to them
wake up by the volume all kinds of fun
stuff you can even change your
navigation bar if you want to add or
change buttons down here for example my
long press 3 action that's this button
right down here is now my search so I
can press and hold to search that or I
should be able to
not everything does exactly what you'd
like it to in an early release like this
again this is being rewritten from the
ground up so not everything is perfect
yet speed is there it's fast does what
you want you can choose between the
stock launcher which is what I've got
running here or nova launcher it ships
with both and lots of stuff that you can
do what's your favourite aokp feature
that hasn't made it into the jelly bean
version yet we want to know head over to
