pocketnow.com and you've already seen
our initial unboxing as well as the part
1 software tour and hardware overview on
the sony ericsson x10 mini in this video
we're going to further extend our
coverage by showing you the part 2 of
the software overview video which will
go into further depth on the social
networking applications some of the
gaming as well as the well famed and
well-loved browser test let's go ahead
and get started welcome back right now
we're going to take a further look into
some of the software that the sony
ericsson x10 mini includes and what you
can do with it on a software sense so as
i showed you in the previous video we
have the custom UI that they have
overlaid here now first off i want to
show you some of these social networking
aspects of this phone itself so of
course you can actually use the facebook
application which i can actually load
right here and we'll just go to my
profile now as you can see it's actually
pretty fast the speeds pretty good
backing out of the facebook app i'm a
huge Twitter user as many of you already
know unfortunately though i use the
official twitter application on Android
and because this uses android 1.6 the
twitter app is not available for this
device so i had to use to i believe it's
pronounced twitter so you can pull this
up right now once again it loads fairly
fast out actually go as far as to say
this loads a little faster if not as
fast and Matt doesn't my evo which is
very surprising based on the cpu speed
of the device so again i can scroll
through here fairly decently the
scrolling is where it gets slow as you
can see it's locking up on most right
now almost as like there's too much
there too low what you mean i do have a
pretty long and full feet here but it
really has trouble keeping up with me on
that sense next up i want to actually
show you the YouTube application the
YouTube app is something that we look at
on every device that we typically use
however on this one I was actually very
surprised but the speed that it loads
that it keeps up with everything else
that I've used so far as you can see
here I can search it is the same
interface as the other apps on the
android devices we're go ahead and go to
the pocket now video page
and now I can actually select the video
here and this is where it's actually to
show off the speaker guys raised you by
before you go Haley speaker very very
very low slot to the fact that I have to
actually turn this down here now bring
us a little closer so you can kind of
see it's a little soft I would say a
little blurry however it colors are very
accurate the camera application can
either be accessed through this
application grid here or by pressing the
actual hardware button for the camera
and what we'll do is we'll actually
bring the camera up right now so that's
a little slow to load their response
time isn't the greatest and I'll take a
picture of my computer stand here this
picture I just took the angle showing
the camera you know isn't the greatest
but fairly good quality picture the
flash goes off pretty well and once
again this screen doesn't do it justice
these pictures actually come up pretty
good when they're put on the computer
itself moving into the email portion of
the device I'm a gmail user myself so I
can actually pull up the Gmail
application here now we're still in
landscape mode but what we can do is we
can once again pick an email here and
now it's actually going to load that
email itself it's not the fastest once
again i mean i think this processor does
hold it back a little bit but at the
same time make it keeps up with the best
of them press show pictures here and now
the logo shows up on most instantly and
i can browse the image i do not have
multitouch though that has the one
downside here no mother should also kind
of have to browse it for what it is does
a good job of scaling a picture and what
you'll finally you have to go left and
right quite often to be able to see the
entire email itself with any images now
sony is also going to bundle quite a
good amount of software on the device
itself from the start they're going to
give you neyo reader to act as your QR
code reader or your scanner they're
going to give you wise pilot which is a
gps tool as well as the road sync so you
can actually use their off the bat
they're also going to give you some
games what I'm going to show you is
actually going to be peggle so you will
pull up the game peggle
you can see here it's a popcap game now
it's actually works fairly decently on
this device especially with the small
screen i actually had expectations where
i thought was gonna be pretty hard to
play however it's really not i found it
not to be difficult at all
of course that won't let me turn it down
while I'm in the application that's not
too good but you can see here I'm
actually playing the game and I can just
simply shoot my little ball and hit all
these other marbles simple as that so
I'm playing peggle on a 2.5 inch screen
it is very small there's times when it's
a little finicky when you're trying to
move the actual target because it is so
small you know your thumb may hit a few
different points at once and it kind of
goes a little haywire but to be very
honest it is pretty accurate from what I
can tell and now it's time for the
fabled browser test now I'm not going to
compare this browser side by side with
another device simply because it would
probably not be fair based on the
processor speed so instead i'm just
going to show it on its own so you guys
can make your own opinion slope up the
browser here i'm gonna tilt it up so we
go back in now pacquiao comments already
prefilled in so we'll go ahead and press
the return key as you see here it's
loading now where it's sitting right now
in terms of the status bar it will sit
there for about 20-30 seconds typically
before that goes away so there's some
sort of code that it's tell us to
finalize I actually believe it might be
the scaling of the page itself to this
resolution because it is very different
now we're all set so now we can browse
through you can see here it's fairly
smooth there are times we gets a little
choppy but you do not once again you do
not have multitouch so you have to zoom
out with this browser at least using
these magnifying tools over here and
that will give you pretty much the full
view of the page itself alright guys and
that's going to do it for the second
part of my software overview video be
sure to stay tuned for the upcoming
final review on the sony ericsson x10
mini as always if you like this video or
any of our videos give us a thumbs up
