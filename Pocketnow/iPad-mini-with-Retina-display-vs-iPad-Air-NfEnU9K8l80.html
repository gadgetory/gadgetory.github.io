new tablets but which one should you buy
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is the iPad Mini with Retina
Display versus the iPad air last month
Apple took the stage to unveil all its
latest products among the new releases
were two brand new iPads the iPad air
and I've had mini with retina display we
have now successfully reviewed both
models and compared them extensively but
we have yet to compare them to one
another which is the better offer should
you get the full-sized iPad air or
scaled-down mini this holiday season
let's take a closer look last year's
full-sized fourth generation iPad and
iPad Mini had their fair share of
differences both internally and
externally this year Apple brought
uniformity to the iPad lineup
consolidating the design and internals
the iPad Mini with Retina display for
all intents and purposes looks exactly
like the original iPad Mini the only
external differences are slight
discrepancies in thickness weight and
the addition of a microphone on the back
side near the top edge on the new mini
the iPad air underwent quite a few
changes however it now features the
exact same design as the iPad Mini only
on a larger scale the edges are rounded
not tapered the speakers are separated
by the Lightning port along the bottom
edge
not a single rear-facing speaker in the
lower left corner and the front trim has
the same chamfered edge the iPad Mini
with Retina display and iPad air are
clearly very closely related since the
major difference externally is sighs how
much disparity is there between the two
the iPad air is 40 millimeters taller
34.8 millimeters wider and it's 138
grams more than the iPad Mini with
Retina display both surprisingly are 7.5
millimeters thick the insides of these
two tablets is much of the same story
both come with 1 gigabyte of RAM 5
megapixel rear cameras 1.2 megapixel
front cameras and the same storage
capacity options 16 32 64 and 128
gigabytes both have 8 7 chips inside as
well the only notable difference is the
battery ratings the air has a 32.4 watt
hour battery while the iPad Mini has a
23-point 8 watt hour cell both come with
Retina displays with pixel resolutions
of 2048 by 1536 pixels at 7.9 inches the
iPad Mini retina display has
notably higher density of 324 pixels per
inch compared to 264 PPI on the nine
point seven inch iPad air that increased
density comes at a cost however the iPad
Air's display is incredible color gamut
contrast black levels and brightness are
fantastic simply put it's one of the
best tablet displays out there the iPad
minis display isn't bad by any means
despite what you've heard its saturation
unfortunately isn't nearly as high as
the Ayers is the difference noticeable
yes if you're looking for it and it's
one of those things that's sort of
difficult to unsee but we feel the
reports that the iPad minis display
appears washed out and substandard are a
tad sensationalist yes it's obviously
less saturated than the full sized iPad
air but if Apple had to make a choice
between clarity and color reproduction
it made the right decision to say one of
these tablets is better than the other
at least in terms of hardware is a bit
silly one has a larger display the other
is much smaller and lighter and those
sort of things appeal to different
buyers and users more on that in a bit
we'll save the discussion of the
software in this video both tablets are
currently running the same exact
versions of software iOS 7 version 7 0.4
there are literally no differences in
the software for more detailed look at
io s 7 and what it has to offer
check out our iOS 7 walkthrough video
linked below the a7 chip set in the iPad
air and iPad Mini is a monster at
performance and despite the minor
difference in clock speed performance is
virtually indistinguishable between
these two tablets both open applications
in the blink of an eye task switching is
snappy pinch zooming within the browser
is effortless and blazing fast in our
time with both tablets we have yet to
truly bog down the a7 chip and
performance is stellar on both tablets
the only hint of a boost thanks to the
100 megahertz faster clock speed of the
iPad air is found when benchmarking the
iPad air scores marginally better than
the mini in various tests such as the
SunSpider JavaScript test where the air
typically scores between 370 and 395
milliseconds and the new iPad Mini
generally scores just over 400 we'd be
surprised if this were enough to sway
anyone toward the air it's negligible at
best
both are great for gaming multimedia
playback and even much simpler tasks the
speakers inside the iPad air are ever so
slightly larger than those found inside
the iPad Mini with Retina display as
such they provide a little more kick in
the form of both more full sound with
more emphasis on the low-end
and more volume being larger it's also
more difficult to fully cover the
speakers on accident but let us be very
clear here we're not happy with the
placement on either tablet the stereo
separation is practically non-existent
and the sound is only ever coming from
one side of the tablet though the audio
isn't bad we recommend using headphones
when possible both tablets are rated at
10 hours of usage and despite the
significant difference in battery size
they both seem to withstand a fair
amount of abuse before begging to be
plugged in the iPad minis battery at 23
point 8 watt hours is much smaller but
so is the display the full-size iPad has
an edge in this category but only just
both provide above-average stamina
typically lasting upwards of a full day
and even sometimes stretching three or
four days on lighter usage camera
quality is neck and neck between these
two tablets the 5 megapixel shooters
aren't the best both would leave you
with dull poorly saturated images with
low contrast and detail they're both
comparable in basically every way except
one comfort the I have had mini as far
less awkward to hold and shoot Stills
and video with but it still looks just
as ridiculous at the end of the day
there are truly only a few things
between these two tablets size weight
display quality and price if you're even
remotely worried about the display
quality shoot for the iPad air though
we're certain most will have few if any
complaints about the iPad minis Retina
display as for price the iPad Mini with
Retina display starts at 399 dollars
jumping $100 per increase in storage the
iPad air is $100 more per model if you
want more storage for less money the
iPad Mini is the way to go after having
used every iPad to date we can leave you
with one major takeaway the iPad Mini is
an ultra portable tablet something you
won't notice in your bag one you won't
mind carrying with you often the iPad
air is larger slightly heavier and is in
our experience at least more suitable
for a couch tablet some
use at home or for more productivity
based tasks there's virtually nothing
between these two but at the end of the
day for us
it's the iPad Mini with Retina display
for having the same power similar
performance and stamina and a great
display all for $100 less than the iPad
air that's going to do it for this
