audience that are just like me I wanted
something that allows me to be
productive like the phones from the old
Windows Mobile days something with a
usable keyboard something small enough
to carry all day but big enough to show
me everything I want to know something
with functionality 44 member you see in
Barcelona I'm high memory better with
pocket now with Jules Wang on camera and
here's our first look at the
functionality Tech Pro one
apparently the people that FX tech are
just like me the uk-based privately
funded startup is teasing a new Android
phone with a sliding keyboard you know
sliding like the Nokia n9 50 now that's
a good sound to hear and if there's any
reason why a smart phone these days
should be 14 millimeters thick it's this
and even though it's been through seven
stages of development so far there's
still more work to be done it's not just
for show there's a five row 64 key
backlit keyboard lying underneath start
typing on it and you'll be taken to a
Google search QWERTY immediately in fact
the company has really worked hard to
improve the functionality of the phone
while in landscape mode things like
optimized email and calendar
applications with two panes once a
navigator inbox your timeline the other
two view your email or appointment other
than that we have a pretty clean version
of Android hi here on top of the older
qualcomm snapdragon 835 processor 60
good bytes of ram 128 gigabytes of
storage with the room for a micro SD
card it's got a 3200 milliamp hour
battery that charges via USB see on the
rear side there's a 12 megapixel Sony
camera with a 5 megapixel focus sensor
on the front is an 8 megapixel shooter
there is a headphone jack thank goodness
and there's a fingerprint sensor set on
the right side the AMOLED display which
spans nearly 6 inches at 1080p looks
quite good to us but we've been told
that FX wants to switch suppliers
another thing to watch out for when we
get a review unit but for now this hunk
of productivity monster may just have my
attention
pricing is expected to be around six
hundred forty nine dollars and pounds
with shipments to start in July yes
we're talking direct sales not some
crowdfunding campaign let us know if you
need something like the pro one in your
life and while you're at it also
followed the rest of our content from
them to be see in Barcelona and follow
us on social media subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one you follow me
on twitter hindquarter you get on
instagram at home italy data please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw i'm high-mettled i think so much
for watching we'll see you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
