when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
make sure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a min over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and when it's not shiny and new
anymore I'm happy that I with
pocketnow.com this is the ipad mini and
this is episode 13 of after the buzz you
know when Apple announced the ipad mini
there was a lot to love it a lot to be
skeptical about most of us wanted a
thinner and lighter iPad and we
definitely got that with the ipad mini
but we wanted a complete experience
including the retina display and the
ipad mini was sadly not exactly what we
wanted I personally wanted the device
that would be perfect for both gaming
and reading books since the larger iPad
is just too big for both of these chores
and even though the gaming problem was
definitely solved with the ipad mini
sadly the reading books experience
wasn't surely it does match the iphone
5s iconic design with the champers edges
in all it's just the beautiful product
altogether but it was definitely not out
there to win the 7-inch tablet race nor
does it make your experience any better
if you come from a larger iPad it's not
the cheapest in the crowd nor is it the
best in pixel density and it's really
just the cheaper iPad for the masses but
not really out there to win any race
when compared to anything else on the
positive side the device feels extremely
light and it's quite sturdy I mean the
design is just beautiful all together
it's
be too thick to fit in your back pocket
though when compared to other 7-inch
tablets but it definitely feels much
better than any other 7-inch tablet out
there or even the larger iPad for that
matter overall hardware is what I'd
really call a mixed bag you get a great
design and a beautiful device but it's
sadly limited when compared to other
tablets in the market at a much cheaper
price tag and that's mainly due to the
lack of a Retina display now what makes
the iPad what it is is really in the
software department and yes I know iOS 6
is not apples best work when it comes to
an operating system but what makes it
succeed is really in the apps the ipad
is the largest and best app selection of
any competing device out there and every
single title place great on the iPad
Mini probably my biggest disappointment
was trying to read magazines on this
thing since smaller text on a non retina
display device means smaller and
sometimes unreadable text in the real
world it may not be an issue for many
but if you don't have good eyesight you
should probably skip the ipad mini and
stick to the retina display iPad in case
now where I'd really recommend an ipad
mini and where I enjoy it the most is in
gaming there aren't tons of both old and
new titles in the App Store that played
great on the ipad mini and when you
consider the fact that this device is
thinning light this is the perfect
gaming machine or at least the perfect
gaming tablet it's definitely no gaming
console will give you that but once you
match the fact that the complete cost of
ownership of a PS Vita is much larger
than an ipad mini won games go on sale
and there's definitely a compelling case
to ona meni instead of a PS vita or
probably just own two devices when it
comes to the overall user experience I
doubt any of you will ever use the
camera but it's one of the best tablet
cameras out there it takes these in
photos in daylight though a bit
overexposed a time though definitely not
for night photography and when it comes
to 1080p video it does a decent job but
again it will never replace your
camcorder some phone cameras do a much
better job than the ipad mini this
device the sport the iphone 4s camera
technology so just remember this is 3
year old technology in the works here
probably one of his high points is the
battery life as with every ipad it can
last for days with moderate use and
since it charges much faster than the
larger iPad
it makes the point of owning a tablet
much more compelling than having to
spend seven hours waiting on the larger
iPad where I struggle the most was
trying to type on this device since
mostly for your lap it'll have smaller
keys than the larger iPad so these are
too small for typing for some and then
these are too large when it comes to
trying to type on it with two hands
where devices like the Nexus 7 which are
narrower than the ipad mini will fit
much better in your hand for doing this
and yes you can definitely separate the
keyboard but the experience is sadly not
the best with the keyboard separated so
bottom line what I still recommend that
you buy an ipad mini after a couple of
weeks of use the answer is kind of
complicated the larger iPad wasn't for
work and the iPad Mini is even less for
work for that matter I'd say that the
iPad Mini is perfect for those who are
carrying a large and heavy laptop
everywhere in which they have a more
intimate experience with the weber with
a book once they're done or if you'd
like to give an ipad to a child or a
little brother and don't want to burn a
hole in your pocket for us power users
it's a good way to start but i'll admit
that i'm already waiting for the ipad 5
to adopt the ipad mini's design or for
the ipad mini 2 which will probably
bring a Retina display if you're
currently rocking an ipad 3 or an ipad 4
there's really no reason to downgrade
and i'm being honest this is a downgrade
and even for those that are buying their
first ipad i do recommend that you give
this device a try first it might be a
good solution for many but it definitely
makes me want to wait for what Apple has
next and really just skip this device
for now that's it for episode 12 up to
