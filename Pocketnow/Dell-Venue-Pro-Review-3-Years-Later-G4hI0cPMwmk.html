varied from the rectangular the venue
was a smartphone some found quite
spectacular it slid and curved and
tapped and glowed it stood apart and all
alone oh it was a stirring sight this
one and only dell phone a michael fisher
and this is the pocket now throwback
review of the Dell Venue Pro okay so it
wasn't the first or the only smartphone
from Dell but you might call it the
first modern Dell handheld and in 2011
the Venu probe was very special indeed
it was part of the first wave of
products running Microsoft's then new
smartphone platform Windows Phone 7 and
among those it shined the venue pros
hardware design was so future forward it
still holds up today it displayed sharp
angles in a side view but those led into
a curved cross-section helped along by a
slightly convex bow to the gorilla glass
on the front the curvature on the back
made the phone quite comfortable to hold
and it's nearly 200 gram mass and
textured back cover gave it a quality
hand feel that's pretty tough to find in
plastic phones nowadays of course it was
a very thick device but the trade-off
that rare QWERTY keyboard was well worth
it to those who needed a physical board
under the thumbs the rubbery keys
offered a click enos that made up for
their limited travel but the keyboard
was pretty small for such a big device
elsewhere the buttons were less
impressive with weak haptic feedback on
the capacitive keys and a mushy a lack
of tactility to the volume power and
camera buttons the camera itself was
also pretty weak but considering the
beauty of the rest of the hardware and
other benefits like a powerful bottom
firing speaker it was easy to forgive
those shortcomings
our demo model here from the personal
collection of Adam Lane is running
Windows Phone 7.5 and while it's
certainly missing many of the modern
touches that have arrived since it also
feels more pure in a way Microsoft was
still aggressively pushing the Metro
design language in the venue pros time
and it felt more consistent more unified
and streamlined than the platform's
current incarnation the company was also
still making a big effort to stand apart
from the crowd by pushing facebook
Messenger integration and the native
social features of the me and people
hubs all of which have since been either
toned down or totally removed along with
other details we didn't realize we
missed until taking mango for another
spin of course there's no going back and
that's especially true for Dell which
announced back in 2012 that it was
quitting the global smartphone market in
a sense that's a good thing as gorgeous
as it is the venue Pro had some serious
hardware and software issues in its
infancy while many of those were
eventually ironed out the real problem
was Dells inconsistent customer service
and its inability to meet shipping
deadlines problems which stretched back
to Windows Phones debut so what was
arguably the most compelling Windows
Phone was also one of the hardest to buy
that's exactly the kind of difficulty
Microsoft didn't need while it was first
trying to push its smartphone platform
and that's even more true in 2014 what
makes the memory of the venue Pro
especially poignant is the era that it
represented there are good-looking and
powerful Windows phones out there today
some of us had pocket now carry them as
daily drivers and maybe we'll see some
of Microsoft's new hardware partners do
some crazy things in their quest to
stand out but nothing can recreate that
particular mixture of hope anticipation
and nostalgia of the Dell Venue Pro in
2011 a rare form factor in a beautiful
package from a brand trying to make a
comeback on a fresh new platform seeking
its own Redemption song those were
exciting days indeed
