intera comm and this is the hardware
review of the Pantech Burst for AT&amp;amp;T one
of the very first 4G LTE phones for AT&amp;amp;T
so let's get to the hardware review so
the Pantech Burst has some pretty slick
hardware features available this is one
of the very first 4G LTE devices for
AT&amp;amp;T and with a subsidized price of
forty nine dollars with a qualifying to
your agreement you get some pretty good
hardware out of that price so let's go
through some of the hardware on this
particular device and it does have a
twelve hundred megahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor the screen is a
four inch Super AMOLED wvga resolution
screen and that is behind a glass
capacitive multi touch digitizer and
what else we have we have 16 gigabytes
of internal wrong so go around the
device and view some of the hardware we
have the headphone speaker here we have
the front-facing vga camera like sensor
and proximity sensor our AT&amp;amp;T logo or
screen of course we had these capacitive
buttons on the bottom our menu our home
are back in our search of course we've
all mentioned that the search button
isn't that functional these days on the
top we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack our power standby button on this of
the device we have our volume rocker and
that's about pretty much it as you can
see we do have these red accents and the
device is available in two colors we
have the Rubin red one which AT&amp;amp;T was
nice enough to send us and it's also
available in graphite on the bottom we
have our primary microphone and we also
have a little tab here to remove the
back battery cover on this side of the
device we have our micro USB charging
sync port here on the back we have the
secondary microphone an LED flash for
our 5 megapixel camera and also our
speaker so on the bottom notes of the
pantech logo here we can just pop off
this battery cover which is made of
plastic but does look like metallic
metal and it does come in two colors
like I mentioned before and you can see
that metallic texture and the light
reflects of the camera so here we have
the micro SD card slot does not come
with a micro SD card but it is
expandable up to 32 gigabytes so it does
give you a potential of forty eight
gigabytes total of memory and we have a
micro sim card which is pretty rare in
the mobile industry of course the first
phone to have the micro sim card was the
iphone 4 and it is nice to be able to
see other devices coming out with a
micro sim card we have a 1650 milliamp
hour lithium-ion battery so we'll just
pop this back on so the dimensions of
the Pantech Burst are sixty five point
two millimeters across 120 6.5
millimeters in height and 11.4
millimeters in debt the radio is keeping
everything connected is we have a
quad-band GSM 850 900 1800 1900 along
with tri-band UMTS hspa+ in the 850 1920
100 bands this particular device does
have LTE and seven hundred and seventeen
hundred megahertz bands so you could
potentially maybe in the future get on
to a verizon's LTE service because they
are running on the 700 bands and one
thing that we noticed on PDA database is
it says that this device has a TDM be
digital tuner so you could potentially
maybe in the future get some digital
broadcast television signals directly to
your pantech burst and you can also
access Wi-Fi in the BG and n bands and
there also is an accelerometer and
digital compass built into the Pantech
Burst so this has been the heart review
of the Pantech Burst 480 which is
capable of running on the AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE
bands but of course those are in very
limited markets around the country so if
you're unable to access those you may
want to hold off on purchasing this
device but if you know that they're
going to come out in the near future or
if you're able to access them by all
means go ahead and purchase this
particular device because this is a
great piece of hardware especially for
the $49 subsidized price stay tuned for
the software review coming up next and
also the final review in the near future
if you like our videos make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave some
comments down below thanks for watching
