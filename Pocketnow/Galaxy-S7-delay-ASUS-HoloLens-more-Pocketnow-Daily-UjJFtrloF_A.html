the launch of the galaxy s7 sony
reportedly working on its quick jump to
android 6th auto marshmallow and it
seems that a sous might bring us its own
hollow lens I'm hi Mary vetta and if I
look hungover it's probably just the
problem with your visuals this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Sony as the company has
gained a lot of popularity for its speed
of adopting any new version of Android
even for extremely old experience and
the Veni of your experience is on the
list in the link of the description you
apparently will be getting injured six
title marshmallow before you thought it
seems that Sony plans to skip Android 51
and go directly to 60 that's not
necessarily a good thing because it
could take a little longer but then I
get it still is good news other sort of
official news come from Samsung those of
you that say that for such certain
technology has always existed on Android
well it seems that Samsung doesn't agree
as well the company has just filed for a
new patent that allows it to bring forth
such technology to future Galaxy
smartphones we're not really sure if
that's going to be part of the galaxy s7
or what but hey it seems that they feel
that there should be more functionality
in that display and speaking of Samsung
and the Galaxy s7 we've got some trusted
sources claiming a possible date for the
Galaxy s7 announcement we were expecting
cees for the product to be available at
mwc for us to check out but as it turns
out it seems that January 16 is actually
closer to the day that they're planning
to announce it which means that they'll
have a separate event and then we can
expect a you know profitable launch to
happen around februari it's really hard
to predict right now we're really far
from that but seems it samsung plans to
bring a ton of innovation here we just
can't wait to see it and to be joined as
an our disappointment for the fact that
the Lumia 950 950 XL are not launching
anywhere but AT&amp;amp;T it seems that that
wasn't necessarily a Microsoft prom it
seems that something is wrong between
Microsoft and Verizon we do remember
that the Lumia icon was an exclusive to
verizon and now it seems that Verizon
does not want the Lumia 950 950 XL up to
the point where even if you
try to bring these phones from AT&amp;amp;T to
work on verizon apparently they will not
activate which is rather interesting we
wonder exactly what is going on lately
with big red and most of the popular
phones out there and finally the hot
news for today have to do with both
Microsoft and Sue's now listen to this
according to Terry Myerson from
Microsoft they're working with a sous on
building their own allah lens with
microsoft software which is really cool
but then when you ask the Susa CEO he
claims that they're still analyzing the
you know possibility and we should wait
and see this is really cool it's cool to
see that hollow lens it's not just the
Microsoft product that scared everybody
with its three thousand dollar price tag
at least for developers it seems that a
sous is going to try it out and other
companies also will bring out their own
hololens products and this is just great
it's going to be an ecosystem but it
does lead me to the question of the day
you're definitely not going to want to
pay three thousand dollars for that
thing so the question is how much
exactly would you be willing to pay for
hololens and that I've asked you this
question before but obviously didn't
really know exactly what we're getting
here until now so leave us a comment
down below I want to know how much would
you be willing to pay I wouldn't top
more than a thousand bucks friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the nose earlier before this video
is filmed make sure you follow us on
Parker no comments a structure a youtube
channel as well it follow me on twitter
