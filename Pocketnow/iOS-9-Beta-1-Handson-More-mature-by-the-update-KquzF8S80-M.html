would be a very conservative software
update focused on ironing bugs it's
actually far from the truth I'm high
metairie met up with pocket now here
with a quick look at iOS 9 beta 1 at a
quick glance iOS line looks very similar
to iOS 8 and 7 but this first beta
brings a bunch of subtle differences
that weren't even mentioned in the
keynote and that do make a lot of sense
for starters iOS 9 is form or search
centric than it was in the past subtle
changes like adding a search bar at the
top of the settings menu for example and
even applications like the photo gallery
as well our differences Apple spotlight
search has also been in hands with a
slide from the left where your favorite
contacts will now be placed in addition
to proactive suggestions from Serie
which aren't really working for
everybody on this first beta you can
still slide from the top of palm scream
though in case you became used to that
as well all this has been enhanced
because Siri now plays a more
predominant role you can now ask it to
give you photos of your last trip to
Barcelona and they'll filter these out
though it doesn't always work on this
first beta or you can even ask it for a
video that you took up somebody at a
birthday party and it will also provide
this information it's also more location
sensitive like Cortana so you can ask it
to remind you of something when you get
to the car and it'll give you the
information when you do it also
integrates with the new changes made to
Apple maps in order to remind you when
you have to leave somewhere again
features that look a lot like Cortana
will have a more extensive look at Apple
maps in a separate video once these are
features get polished Notification
Center has also seen some minor changes
witches are still at the same useless
place but notifications are now filtered
by date and time and not by application
which is more useful else has also
received the subtle change in making it
less of a bare-bones sheet of digital
paper with doodle options checklist etc
Apple's passbook is now renamed to Apple
wallet with options to add more card
types though the mileage may vary
depending on where you live since Apple
pay is still blocked for certain
countries
Apple is also boast that that iOS 9
improves battery life by one hour on
regular use and up to three hours in its
new power saver mode though obviously
this is pre-release software and so far
we're glad this is beta one because our
battery experience so far has been
terrible really bad other enhancements
were made to how responsive out the OS
is and that's even available in beta one
you'll notice that animations have been
dropped and made more subtle and giving
you the impression that the OS is
actually faster other more hidden
changes come in security to certain
degree like for example adding 6 to
depend codes for unlocking your device
or even two-step authentication for
iCloud in case you need it iCloud Drive
also gets ahead an application that you
can activate from the iCloud settings as
well and epel also those as far as to
giving you a migration tool from Android
since that's been very common lately now
probably the coolest change that we get
is multitasking which changes to a
certain degree in the iPhone but goes
major on the iPad on the iPhone it
brings a very different user interface
with larger cards and a slider from the
left instead of the right and you'll now
notice that your favorite contacts are
not placed at the top anymore since
these already became part of the left
slider the animations for switching
between apps have also changed in order
to make it more so than it was
previously and if you make a quick
switch between one application and
another iOS will now give you an
indicator at the top left to switch back
allowing you to save a DoubleTap in the
homeland on the iPad this changes
dramatically better most iPads are
getting a new slide over from the right
feature which will allow you to snap
notes or other application options which
is really cool but notice that this
places the primary application to sleep
there is also a picture in picture mode
that allows you to continue watching a
video while you're doing something else
which is extremely useful now those of
you owning an iPad air 2 are getting the
biggest treat as multitasking does
extend to allow you to have Windows
placed side-by-side in any orientation
and allowing you to use both
applications at the same time
the ipad keyboard was also enhanced with
a new trackpad like function in addition
to giving you more gesture options that
truly make this feel like more of the
modern computer that Apple intended it
to be and so far that's the biggest
takeaway with iOS 9 this is the most
mature we've ever seen iOS become and
making iPads in particular feel more
like computers to a certain degree now
we've got more coverage from iOS 9 and
comparison with Android M in addition to
other videos coming very soon so make
sure you follow us on social media so
