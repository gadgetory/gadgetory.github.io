Boca funk who I'm here to
comment on every video about Pokemon f1
it's a great time this is actually day -
one of Google i/o they flew us an early
they're giving us a tour of the place
I'm stoked my first time at the
Googleplex
we just passed by the Android building
which is building 43 I wow it's so
fantastic to be here we've got a lot to
see I'm that I'm that guy from and you
might you might have seen me that you
show there's a very large possibility
that this is gonna be hilarious there's
only one way to find out see I'm never
gonna complain about selfie sticks again
in my life
googolplex experience one so far so
friggin awesome this is the coolest
thing like character best believe and of
course you can't come to the Googleplex
without doing the whole statute or of
all the different versions of android
android pi is actually at the entrance
of the Googleplex these are the old ones
they've moved them to a different
section but this is I've always wanted
to see this so we're currently in the
garage
whenever Googlers have an idea they come
here and they have absolutely all the
materials they want to be able to build
them from scratch the reason why it's
called the garage is because Larry and
Sergey that's the way they began cool
it's very fascinating there are
absolutely all the materials you can
think of it's a very collaborative area
and if you leave it messy you actually
have to clean it up
yeah observe the proto-chicken I'm
getting Googlers to get to summon a
woman so that they can go home and cook
for themselves so we're currently at
kitchen sink cooking class because
that's actually something that Google
also provides for their voice did you
them I find fantastic we're gonna make
cookies
these are kitchen sink cookies meaning
we can pair oh absolutely anything we
can at them so I'll grab a couple of
microphones and probably a computer and
throw it in there posted good morning
this is Google i/o my first ever and
we have just arrived at the amphitheater
I pronounced that right
all right let's do this good morning
good morning
one definitely be back here at show
language to all of you every year at i/o
we love and try to make things a little
bit better the smart home of today is
fragmented and frustrated to deliver
real help in the home you can't start
with technology you have to start with
people and we've always worked to put
people first alright so the Google i/o
keynote is over our pixel 3a is in hand
our hands-on video is live it's been
hard keeping it a secret but then again
it looks so much like the pixel 3 that
really wasn't got so much more coming up
after the keynote is done it's all about
the sandboxes which is google's way of
calling this their demo areas we've seen
accessibility right now we're currently
seeing AI there's one for Android auto
that I'm really looking forward to
seeing this is pretty much the
experience area I've loved everything
that I've seen so far and there's so
much more to see coming up
so seems that Google has realized that
we're stressed out so the next session
this is even more interesting than
everything else so we are currently in
the Android automotive experience and
yeah I didn't say Auto because there is
now Android auto mode oh there is now a
new version of Android auto and there is
a new way to use your Google assistant
to be able to use it during driving
which I find that to be extremely
important
there are a ton of highlights definitely
Android auto mode of being its own
unique - we're pretty much like Android
TVs like on a car the cars are not gonna
be ready right now we're talking about
the new Volvo's that are gonna come out
in a couple of years and then we also
see the updates to Android auto or they
have a much more streamlined user
interface to help you be able to
continue seeing your navigation while
you're trying to move to another window
and then obviously the fact that you can
now use the Google assistant while
driving in a way that's not gonna deter
from the experience of actually focusing
on the road I love the fact that Google
is making these changes I am an Android
auto user every single day and they got
them everything that I've seen in Google
i/o obviously there are a ton of really
cool things but the future of automotive
particularly I'm glad to see that Google
is taking charge here definitely one of
my favorite highlights of the show
that has pretty much been it for Google
i/o honestly I was not expecting to be
the surprise this entertained and this
optimistic over what Google is doing and
how this developer conference shapes
everything that we get to play with
going forward I'm really really
interested to seeing the developments
that are coming over the next couple of
months the experience from Google i/o
has been fantastic definitely I highly
recommend that you give it a try at some
point if you ever can this is probably
one of my favorite shows ever like that
high of a bar for it let us know what
you think about the experience in the
comments down below while you're at it
make sure you follow us on social media
to show up to both of our channels
English and Spanish more videos like
this one you follow me on twitter hyn
