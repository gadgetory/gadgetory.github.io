just played Puggsy mobile using
controllers on an Android smartphone and
I got a winner winner chicken dinner
hey this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody here's
your first hands-on with the Black Shark
- this just might be the gaming phone
now aesthetically this is the equivalent
of getting a large heavy gaming laptop
and using it for all of the general
notebook purposes the screen is an
AMOLED panel at 6.4 inches and is meant
to really show off media and games
obviously in vivid fashion as it is
tuned to the DCI p3 standard now it is a
full HD plus screen which might be a
small bummer to those of you spec hungry
folks who want quad HD in a flagship
device but trust me that might be the
only spec that's kind of missing what is
otherwise an incredibly stacked device
and we haven't even gotten to the
accessories yet given that touchscreens
are the inherent method of input for
mobile games black shark did ensure that
the touch latency in this screen is at
an all-time low clocking in at forty
three point five milliseconds and touch
response the black shark to is able to
achieve better latency than phones like
the iPhone or the Galaxy S ten this
particular feature was actually
demonstrated in incredible fashion on
stage by a champion gamer playing an
insane level in a Guitar Hero like game
pushing all of this as the Snapdragon
855 in the audrina 640 these are already
the latest and greatest chips but they
can be pushed even further thanks to
black sharks additions and tweaks these
include what they call liquid cooling
3.0 which is a vapor cooling system
consisting of two different parts one
for both halves of the phone top and
bottom so that all parts of the device
that might get warm are addressed of
course that means dissipating heat from
the processor but that also means the
charging port stays cool as well all of
the bits around it that means that this
phone can achieve 27 watt fast charging
but you can also charge the phone
effectively while you're playing a game
so you don't have to worry about topping
up this battery even when you continue
your intensive gameplay the four
thousand milliamp hour battery always
has a way of getting more juice as for
the external aspects of the gaming
experience loud dual front-facing
speakers blast the audio right in your
face while the phone actually uses its
vibration motors to give them more
immersive experience to gameplay via
contextual feedback the cameras are
actually an afterthought of sorts in
phones that are this
we hope that black trucks affiliation
with Xiaomi has rubbed off well enough
on their development and will lead to
good pictures and videos on the final
product that said this is a dual 12
megapixel system and one of them is made
for 2 X optical zoom the front shooter
is a 20 megapixel shooter capable of
portrait mode effects and AI Beauty
modes and all of this is housed in a
body with the gamer specifically in mind
the X shape of the back panel allows for
the user to rest their fingers naturally
on parts of the back making long
gameplay easier on the hands that X
shape by the way is how the antennas are
aligned that way no matter how you might
be holding the phone there's always
Wi-Fi or mobile signal unimpeded by our
palms and fingers but what if you want
to take things to the next level
overclocking is a term you might know
from the gaming community and it's only
now just getting into gaming smartphones
and the black shark 2 is no exception
black shark calls it the ludicrous mode
think of this as hitting the sport mode
on a car it frees up resources that are
otherwise taking up the engine or in
this case the CPU so that all resulting
available power goes to better
performance as the games that I have
played so far on your including pub G
have shown me that CPU usage is still at
a low so it's not like I needed to push
things further anyway it should be a
setting along with many other gaming
settings that are found inside of the
shark space a portion of the operating
system that is accessed by hitting a
toggle above the power button when
shifted the phone does a memory dump and
clears out any background application so
that every little bit can be put toward
the game of your choice if all of these
things put together actually do make the
phone kind of warm and let's say hot
there is a cooling case that is
available that helps with further
airflow but that's just one accessory
that is used to make one of the most
robust gaming phone packages ever other
accessories include an HDMI cable to
make the phone sort of like a ultra
portable console and then a gamepad that
can actually be split apart and
connected to the phone via compatible
cases to create something like an
android switch now while all this adds
length and weight to the original
smartphone package that is plenty
powerful on its own those hardcore
gamers that really play their online
games for hours on end and need the best
experience in both performance and input
will probably not mind they might
actually prefer the black shark to in
this highest configuration but the setup
that you're seeing right now I actually
unboxed already over on my channel
youtube.com slash Josh over
so if you want to get that and some
quick reaction some early reactions to
some gaming experience on the black
truck too you can head over to my
channel as well the hardcore mindset is
what the black shark too strives to
satisfy the goal is to be the definitive
Android gaming experience and with all
of this thought put into properly
prioritizing aspects that really appeal
to power gamers they might have indeed
created the most compelling case this is
still an Android smartphone capable of
doing everything that you would throw at
it
productivity media consumption and of
course in gaming but once you're done
doing all of the regular stuff just a
little click of this toggle right here
get you to an area that transforms this
phone into a gaming machine and it has
all of the bits and pieces to transform
it physically into one as well the black
shark 2 is available now in China and is
going to be released in India as well
European markets will be getting their
hands on this gaming device fairly soon
and we'll see what other markets they
might actually penetrate later in 2019
if you were to take the price of the
Black Shark - in China and just
converted one to one to the US dollars
the base model at six gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
coming at around $500 and the top tier
model can get up to six hundred and
twenty-five dollars
I already got sucked into a few games
when trying to get the footage for this
and also my video after unboxing this
device so I'm pretty certain that I'm
going to get into some new games simply
because the input and the power and the
gamepad make it a lot easier to do so I
might actually get into some online
games because of this thing but in any
case I'll give you all of my thoughts
here on a final review in Pocket now but
also over on my channel I'll probably do
some more gaming videos using this after
all this can actually do some live
streaming as well but I have to get that
set up and I also have to get used to
doing that but until all of that comes
out I'm just gonna go ahead and call it
on this one thank you so much for
watching subscribe to pocket now if you
haven't already and you can head over to
my channel as well to see even more
content from the black shark too with
all of that said get into the comment
sections let me know what you think
about this stacked gaming device but
from there we'll just see you in our
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
