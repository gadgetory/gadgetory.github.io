pocket now calm and this is the software
review part 1 of the sprint Evo 4G in
this video we're going to talk about the
Sense interface from HDC and we're also
going to go through internet browsing in
part 2 we're going to talk about the
built-in applications the wireless
tethering then we're going to talk about
the 4G connectivity in case you missed
it check out the hardware of you I'll
put an annotation up on the screen right
now so go check that out if you haven't
yet but if you did let's get on with the
software review part 1 let's do it ok so
let's talk about this Sense interface on
HTC EVO 4G we've seen the Sense
interface before but we've never seen it
on a 4.3 inch display it makes it very
dramatic with the beautiful widgets and
the backgrounds and everything that
makes HTC Sense useful and interesting
so of course with HTC Sense you get
seven different home screens and you can
flick all the way this way and all the
way this way the way that you keep track
of the home screens is that you can see
the little bar moving along the bottom
and new to the newer version of HTC
Sense is the leap of feature so you can
pinch and quickly jump from screen to
screen so if you're on screen1 you want
to get the screen 7 it's extremely fast
and easy now with this feature so a
great addition let's look at some of the
live wallpapers so you can get a sense
for how it looks on such a big display
so I'm gonna go into menu and I'm not
going to go into settings I'm going to
go into wallpaper then I'm gonna go into
live wallpaper I also want you to pay
attention to how fast the devices as I'm
bouncing around
it's about 512 megabytes of RAM it's got
the Qualcomm 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor and I'll have a conclusion
about that later but I'd like for you to
see in this video how it looks so let's
pick say HTC Sense since this is HTC
Sense afterall and we get this cool
animated background with the kind of
colors moving in the background we'll
keep it like that and let's go through
some of the different widgets that you
can add to the HTC EVO 4G of course you
can go into the Android Market and
download a bevy of other widgets for
example I've added this little battery
meter here just a quick and easy way to
see how much battery I have so of course
I can tap on the clock here and I'm
taken into the
TC scents like interface where I can
swipe to the right see my alarm
I see the stopwatch so this East HTC
Sense interface is very congruent
throughout the entire operating system
just like you would expect from an HTC
device so let's swipe to the right and
I've got some widgets here I've got a 4G
switch but I'm actually using Wi-Fi if
you have a Wi-Fi connection available 4G
will turn off and you will go on to
Wi-Fi the reason I'm using Wi-Fi and not
4G right now it's because Wi-Fi is
actually faster than 4G where I am so
we'll talk more about 4G later I've got
some other shortcuts there some other
toggle switches for GPS oddly when I got
the Evo 4G the GPS was toggled on all
the time and my battery life was
horrendous and after turning that off
battery life is still not that great but
it's improved a lot I have no idea why
Sprint out of the box as GPS turned on
they're gonna get a lot of angry
customers when they see their battery
draining so quickly so let's add some
widgets you can tap and hold go to
widgets and HTC adds a variety of really
cool widgets so we can go to the
bookmark tab and we can choose a variety
of styles to different styles so I'm
going to choose this one and loading
bookmarks and we get a quick shortcut
there a quick list of various bookmarks
that you like to look at on a regular
basis and you can easily add your own so
if I go down to add bookmark and I don't
know if let's put Google and by the way
I want to talk about this on-screen
keyboard this on-screen keyboard is in
my opinion the best on-screen keyboard
of any mobile device and I say that
because the screen is extremely
responsive and also the screen is so big
so it's very difficult to miss keys when
you're pressing and also you get a
massive massive touchscreen keyboard
here when you go into landscape if you
have the HTC hd2 you know what I'm
talking about it's the same sort of
experience so I just added Google and
what it does really nice it saves a
little thumbnail so you get these live
thumbnails of the website so that you
view on a regular basis a really cool
widget I like it a lot
let's jump back into widgets and I'll
show you some other cool ones so we've
got the Facebook widget you've seen that
before
you have footprints if you travel
the friend stream the mail widget the
text message widget alright let's go
into the HTC photo album this one looks
awesome on the Evo 4G because of the big
screen so I'm just going to choose the
the photo album that I want to use in
this particular widget it's gonna load
it up this is a great way to show people
photos if you've taken a bunch or you
have albums stored on the storage card
you just flick through and it just looks
it just looks awesome on such a big
screen then we can go into landscape and
we can go through the photo galleries
super smooth tap on that one bring it
forward just pictures are are gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous on WVGA screen it's
got a very nice level of sensitivity for
the pinch-to-zoom
so let's go back to the home screen
delete this widget and by the way I've
loaded this up with a lot of widgets and
I found that it doesn't slow down in
fact what I can do to show you an
example of that I can go to menu and
click on scenes and scenes are preset
widget configurations so I'm going to go
to the HTC scene which will add a
variety of widgets for this particular
scene so I'm gonna let it load up it
gives a different background it'll
probably change there goes and what we
have is a variety of widgets we have the
HTC mail widget we have the SMS widget
the weather widget which is always nice
to have it knows your current location
and it will immediately pull the weather
and update it wherever you are if you're
traveling let's go over here here's that
favorites widget you actually this is
the the people favorite widget very nice
to show you the pictures of the people
that you call to the right we have the
bookmarked widgets and nothing over that
way let's go back to scenes and change
it again let's go to play and see what
the play widgets look like okay so we
get this awesome big clock this is the
kind of scene that you want to use on
the weekend get a cool different
background links to voicemail camera
we'll talk about camera in the next
video part 2 tap descent alibi friends
stream so this will tie into multiple
social networks right now I have it only
synchronizing with Twitter so you get
these many applications right on your
home screens and with the four
three inch display on the Evo four teeth
just it's very dramatic and I keep using
that word and you really have to hold
one in your hand and use it to know what
I'm talking about and so we have a music
player here bookmarks and over to the
right there is nothing so widgets are
fantastic even 14 handles it
fantastically well as well as the HTC
Desire which is another Android phone
that has the HTC Sense interface for
Android
ok so let's jump into the browser and
quickly show you what it's like to
browse websites on this 4.3 inch display
let me just make sure that I don't have
any other windows open just so I have
maximum performance and I don't so let's
jump to pocketnow.com will go into
landscape we'll do a speed comparison
against the Google Nexus 1 in a moment
and let's see see how it looks this may
be a good time to put up the kickstand
although it puts it at a weird angle for
the camera so another great use for the
kickstand by the way is when you're on
speakerphone
I've done this a few times I'm on the
phone I'm at my desk I put it up like so
and it makes the the speaker have an
exposed area about out here so I can
hear the speaker and then the microphone
is exposed over here so let's take a
look at performance very very good
performance on the web we can pinch to
zoom tap on a headline and Rover a fast
Wi-Fi connection so it's coming through
nicely and here we go let's go to
another website and again again we get
this nice landscape keyboard we'll go to
and gadget you get a little bit of
haptic feedback when you type on this
keyboard and you can turn that off
if it had no issue in fact I'm probably
going to do that because battery life on
the Evo 4G hasn't been amazing and I
want to do anything possible to get back
some more juice so here we are on end
gadget but a boot up the the Nexus One
here running Froyo I'm gonna go to the
same place and we're going to click
around ok so here we are
Engadget loaded on both devices again
we're running a newer browser on the
right here with Froyo
so we can move around on the page
can get a sense for how things load
let's go down to a link and we'll zoom
in will zoom in and tap on a link at the
same time just to see we're over the
same Wi-Fi network here let's see which
goes faster and it looks like the frozen
the Froyo browser one no surprise it's
got a lot of speed improvements let's
see how fast screen rotation is for the
Evo 4G very fast not as fast that time
it was faster so very very very fast
screen rotation speed and very good web
browsing performance on the Evo 4G and
as you can see it's it's awesome
browsing on such a large display you
just get to see so much of the Internet
it feels like a slate computer so in
terms of HTC Sense the homescreen
interfaces the widgets the HTC EVO 4G
really shines the huge display that the
fantastic color reproduction means that
you get a really immersive home screen
experience that really is unrivaled by
any other device I've ever used and in
terms of the internet browsing fidelity
and the capability it's up there with
the best of the best the big screen
helps a lot it's got a fast processor
and it just looks awesome or any webpage
really looks awesome on a 4.3 inch
display can't argue with that coming up
in part two of the software review we're
going to talk about some of the built-in
applications or to talk more about the
4G capability of this device whether it
really matters so be sure to check that
out if you liked the video please give
it a thumbs up we'll be back soon with
more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
