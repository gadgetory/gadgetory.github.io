pay with beer only hina complaints about
the noises nobody else hears sm h you
don't tell the neighbors to crank the
volume up now usually I want you before
i go to school on the toilet but today
you get the honor of being the last
video i watch before I go to sleep I
feel flattered that I'm not on the
toilet anymore that's right it's that
time of the week I am high meta meta
this is pocket now and this is the
pocket out daily recap for last week
Sunday the topic was the possibility of
a future HTC nexus are probably too as
the rumors point that that's going to
happen and I asked you what would you
want from this future Nexus smartphone
made by HTC we had 780 comments if HTC
build something like the Nexus 9 ain't
no one gonna buy it and that wasn't such
a bad tablet I mean hey but it was
mostly Google's design anyway I want
nice build quality and boom sound but I
hope it doesn't have giant bezels in a
terrible camera which HTC is notorious
for having yeah I agree obviously boom
sound is a must have for this HTC nexus
device it can be 5.3 inch to 5.7 inch
device with microSD expansion 3,500
milliamp hour battery 12 16 megapixel
camera fingerprint scanner no bezels and
for the love of god no HTC chin bar
please I think you got it all man but on
Tuesday the topic was Samsung uh there
are rumors that the company is only
going to launch the smaller phones for
early this year and leave the phablet's
for later and I asked you if you would
mind we had 540 comments bring back
removable batteries at expandable
storage and I'm coming back to Samsung
yeah I guess you don't mind them I don't
know if I'm the only one nowadays but I
don't really care about phablets I still
prefer phones of the 5-inch screen it
must be lonely out there isn't it it
makes no sense to release another
phablet so soon for a marketing
standpoint it's just dumb if one is a
release that will flop only people
buying it are techies or people rolling
in cash I doubt any sensible person
would upgrade from an s6 edge+ they
bought less than four months ago and I
do agree i feel that that's just what
Samsung's doing probably the
but he just designed all the phones at
the same time and they prototype them as
well but they're going to hold off the
phablet's for later on Wednesday the
topic was mainly analysts predicting
that 4 2016 I've people are going to
stop spending so much on smartphones
apparently it's the time for the premium
mid-range and I asked you if you had the
option when you go for a premium
mid-range dress the ones we've seen
today or would you buy a flagship we had
eleven hundred and sixty-nine comments
thanks a lot your income will be the
judge of that and you know I left this
comment first because I actually don't
agree with it I constantly see people
that can't afford an expensive phone
with an expensive phone and then I
constantly see people with tons of cash
that end up buying these like dumb
phones because they just don't like
spending much premade mid Rangers are
good but if I have a phone for one or
two years I'm going flagship all the way
and that yeah that is probably the best
way to go but then again it's funny
these flagships are the ones that age
you were sometimes because they're the
topic of attention so companies do
planned obsolescence early in order to
have people by other flagships and make
more money my budget allows it I'd
always go for flagship devices those are
the devices companies focus on most and
thus they would be the best phones
available true in theory in most cases I
wish we could say that about samsung
phones for example of they age great
when it comes to hardware this year but
their software nevermind I'm Thursday
the topic was the iphone mini or 5s key
whatever you want to call it as a we saw
it later on video and we asked you if
you thought that those leaks for real
because it just looks like a downsampled
iphone 6 eventually we learned that it
probably was real we had 869 comments I
feel that the iphone 5s was the best I
designed the iphone and i love how some
of the comments or pretty much in this
video in particular none of the comments
had to do with the question but then
again you're alone and that no you're
not a lot of people like the iphone 5s
design i particularly didn't because of
the champers and how bad they looked
after a month they made a smaller iPhone
I prefer to look something like the 55 s
with a little redesign not like the six
success line you mean something in
between and I wouldn't mind that so long
as they don't go cheap skate like the
iphone 5c for example only Apple this
iphone
many will probably be like fifty dollars
cheaper than the success and you know I
had to stop this morning where I was
like you know they're probably charged
more for this phone then they'll bring
Johnny I'm on video saying the
miniaturization process that was used on
this phone was so infatuated that's even
a word and just to justify the reason
why it's so expensive is because it
costs more to make the component smaller
that's Apple man and then finally Friday
we heard how Google was obligated to
disclose how much money they had made
with Android because of the whole Oracle
lawsuit and stuff and I asked you do you
believe that company should keep that
information a secret we had four
comments we start with I don't care how
much they are making as long as they
give me good products you know a lot of
companies are making a lot of money and
not making good products but hey yeah
pocketnow should post all their expenses
and profits on each of their activities
and social climate i as a random dude on
the internet has the right to know where
they are headed and I love your sarcasm
i bought scotch this morning should that
count I'm fine a company is private just
like anyone elses private in their
salary they aren't obligated to display
their money and the main reason why i
asked this question is because we have
cases like for example Apple they have
the Apple watch and they don't want to
disclose how many products they've sold
or how much money they've made and so
it's really hard for the market to grasp
market share that way and Apple is doing
it intentionally because they're not
making much money i feel that companies
should at least be obligated to disclose
how many products they sold I mean they
only tell you how many iPhones they sell
but they don't tell you how many iphone
6s sr sold and I feel that should be
disclosed in a way that other companies
should know how Apple is doing with this
year's products not with the whole scope
I mean they have three products are
milliner I think you get my opinion
that's it for the pocket no daily we
kept thank you very much for watching a
couple of tips if you want your comments
