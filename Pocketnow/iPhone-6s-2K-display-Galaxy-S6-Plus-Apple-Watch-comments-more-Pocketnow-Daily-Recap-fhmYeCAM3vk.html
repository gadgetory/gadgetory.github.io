is so awesome and what is so
 trying to speak with a high
pitch voice that would improve the sound
trust me right this guy is in a porno
and I've heard that before which movie
is it that's right it's that time of the
week I am hi Matt leave it up this this
pocket now and this is the buying out
daily recap for last week so at Monday
ask you if the lack of carrier subsidies
would affect you in any way as AT&amp;amp;T is
killing them and Shore the rest of the
carriers in the United States we have
366 comments out of which Gary says
subsidies are BS and I take it you don't
like them and my chem says I've been
buying my iphone through the apple store
at full retail since 2009 thank you
carry yours for the discount but I'd
rather have my phone and my carrier
separated and that's the way it happens
mostly around the world I think the
United States is just catching up to the
way things are and Tyler says no I hate
buying carrier phones because of the
bloat and slowed updates and the truth
that is a major problem the United
States the problem is that the next
services for AT&amp;amp;T and edge from verizon
are still gonna continue doing these
same things I don't think that the lack
of subsidies will fix that but I'm just
they ask you how much would you be
willing to pay for a TV subscription
service as the rumors are that Apple is
going to bring that in the fall since it
didn't happen at WWDC we have 378
comments out of which andrew says
multi-platform a streaming service would
need to be and yes yoda or master yoda
that would be you are so right if it's
not multi-platform we are done but Apple
is doing that with its new Apple music
so I guess that is the way to go then
adam says is it possible one market that
Apple can't crack definite will ever be
as cheap as your content for table for
six pounds in the UK you can't really go
wrong with Netflix and true but this is
something very different to Netflix
we're talking about on demand TV not
just on-demand movies which would be
revolutionary in a way for some people
and Reza says i would pay twenty dollars
to Netflix if they would add sports
streaming to their services and
yeah I feel that a lot of people would
do that I pay ten dollars for dish which
is now I forget the name of their new I
think it's sling TV or something I paid
ten dollars for that just for sports
plus eight dollars on netflix plus hulu
hey if they offered me thirty dollars
for everything everything that's
available on cable and the movie
services like Netflix all combined I
think that would be an amazing service
but that's just my opinion then on
Wednesday ask you to Kate displays on
smartphones are overkill as a rumors are
that Apple is going to do that with the
iphone success we have 753 comments out
of which text x software says don't care
just give us better battery life and I
think that's the best comment of the
week the United come to the point where
I really don't care if I get a 4k
display anything above 1080p in my
opinion is overkill I would love better
battery life and that's something that
nobody's been able to figure out yet and
talk text says 2k would never change my
mind about a phone's display I have not
seen a bone to date that was only better
because of resolution since 1080p became
the norm and okay this galaxy note edge
in particular has an amazing display and
it is quad HD I think we should just
draw the line there let's just leave it
there and give us better battery life
going forward and another commenter says
two gay displays look amazing don't get
me wrong but they just aren't needed in
smartphones a good 1080p display is
spying for smartphones and I agree with
that again I feel the 1080p should be
should draw the line and then for
phablets then yes give us 2k and yeah
give us better battery life going
forward let's just not jump to 4k there
just needs it needs to be a limit then
on Thursday ask you if after the buzz
you still care out the Apple watch as
Apple is expanding the reach of the
product to go to Europe and other
countries we have 321 comments out of
which one of them says i love my Apple
watch I can feel my grandma's heartbeat
to make sure she's still 0 &amp;amp; supply says
don't care much about it price is too
expensive for what you're actually
getting and I feel that you are getting
more than Android wear but yeah the
price tag is still not warranted then
attach silver says $350 for a square
watch that doesn't last the whole day it
only works with the iphone yeah
don't Karen yeah the fact that it only
works with the iphone is a problem but
it does last more than a day sometimes
and finally on Friday ask you was your
current video streaming box as Apple has
overtaken Roku with its Apple TV and we
don't know how we have 549 comments out
of which Northeast says chromecast all
the way and for 35 bucks of course it is
and Sarah says at my house I have a roku
and I've been meaning to try Roku I just
don't know what are the international
limitations look into that because I am
compelled for certain reasons and then
baby Joker says all these streaming
devices need to die off why aren't smart
TVs focusing more on this I would rather
have a smart TV that does everything
well rather than by all these extra
stuff the problem is that there is no
such thing as a smart TV that is
actually smart it's just worthless for
you to pay so much extra premium for
something that these products can do
right you can get for a chromecast so I
get the point that's it for the pocket
out daily recap thank you very much for
