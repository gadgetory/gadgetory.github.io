ago and before we bore you in the
bargain our daily with a full edition
that has to do with Apple there was so
much substantial news here that it
deserves its own video I'm hi Marilee
better with pocket now apologizing for
the treatment in my eyes just bear with
me here here is our quick first
impressions of WWDC watch os3 was a
major update up to the point where it
made me pull my apple watch off
mothballs the changes include
performance enhancements apparently the
apple watch will be less clunky now
applications will launch instantly
because these are now allowed to run in
the background and this includes
third-party applications up to the point
where the app will even remove the usage
of context on the button at the bottom
and now you can actually call on the
dock which is where these third-party
applications and applications in the
background will lie I don't change us
include a new control center at the
bottom in addition to the fact that your
activity tracking is now apparently
smarter you can even now invite your
friends and track whatever your friends
are doing post challenges and everything
we cannot wait to give it a try TV OS
was a less substantial update but it is
still cool it starts with the fact that
now your iPhone has an application the
remote app is now getting an update that
allows it to behave like a Serie remote
you can control the Apple TV you can use
your keyboard even cooler you can use
the iPhone as an apple TV control for
gaming which is awesome now Siri is more
enhanced as well Syria's now able to
tinker into third-party applications so
now it can search for YouTube videos it
can search for live TV on ESPN for
example and you can actually make your
apple TV jump directly into that and not
force you to go into the application and
through the whole user interface the
user interface is also getting a booster
you'll now have a single sign-on feature
where all you do is sign on once and not
add all your passwords from your cable
operators etc and even better is
apparently the fact that it'll get
faster in addition to also a dark theme
that's another thing we cannot wait to
try OS 10 is no more now let's talk
about Mac OS starting with its new
release Sierra and that there are two
major changes that took all the
spotlight one is
enhance continuity in addition to the
fact that it now supports Siri in the
case of continuity this was probably the
coolest one because first of all somehow
your computer through networking will be
able to know when you're using your
Apple watch in front of it and unlock
the computer and even though it wasn't
mentioned we're sure that you'll be able
to use touch ID as well with the mac and
touch ID also plays a major role through
Apple pay on the web because you'll be
prompted on your iPhone to allow a
purchase that's happening on your
computer which is also cool you now also
have a universal clipboard which is
awesome now you'll be able to copy
something on your iPhone and then
continue it on the mac which is great
and when it comes to Siri Siri also
allows you to not just use it as your
assistant but for example it can now
search within your files you can then
filter that search of your files through
who sent you the file and then you can
pin that to your notification tray as a
widget for you to be able to reference
it in the future these are just some
minor changes that are coming to Marco
SCR I was about to say OS 10 that's
another update that we cannot wait to
give a try because mainly it's it's
funny there was this analogy on Twitter
where everything you can do on the
iPhone you can now do on the Mac and
vice versa that's pretty much what
happened here now the longest segment is
going to be iOS 10 because the changes
are insane a lot of common sense is
coming here and I'm going to try to
narrow these as much as possible you get
a new lock screen and this lock screen
now enhances the use of 3d touch you can
now use 3d touch to read notifications
and you can even use 3d touch to call on
these notifications and respond to
messages for example grab an uber for
example we wonder exactly how that's
going to work on the iPhone as e where
there is no 3d touch we're going to work
on a video for that but you'll also get
a new home screen that new home screen
includes a new notification center new
control center at the bottom that also
allows you to control your music in
addition to a new type of today screen
that allows you to get all your
information at a glance it's very
practical but even cooler is the fact
that 3d touch again now allows you to
hit on the application
and get enhanced information of what
that application just got like for
example ESPN you're following a team and
you will get sports scores etc there is
a lot that we cannot wait to test mainly
again for devices like the iPhone s ii
the iPad for example as well another
change now comes to phone calls because
now it supports voice over IP now there
is an easier way to call on the dialer
from your lock screen as well and even
cooler is that your contact cards will
now also support voice over IP features
that's another great update even more
important is Siri the fact that it now
is supported by third-party developers
and again all the enhancements that we
saw happening through Mac OS then in the
case of maps well even though we don't
really care much about maps now you'll
be able to mark a navigation and then
within that navigation you'll be able to
find restaurants within your route there
is a new user interface that looks a
little more intuitive and you can even
book your reservation on a restaurant or
whatever through the Maps application
Apple music is another one of those
services that got the updates that we
were expecting mainly it's no longer
that convoluted service it looks a lot
more like Spotify and in addition some
other applications that are just blended
here but the ideas are great now you've
got tabs at the bottom quick access to
whatever music is downloaded to your
phone in addition to your library in
addition to ways to connect with
whatever services and radio stations
Apple is suggesting one of the major
ones was home kit there is a new home
application that at a simple glance
allows you to control everything that's
at your home in a very practical way we
love this update in particular photos
just got another update that allows you
to think of Google photos in a way first
of all because you've now got places and
these places allow you to hit on the
place and you get the whole story of
everything you saw there it's like if it
also blends Zoe from HTC because you're
able to create videos from these and
there's also an option for memories and
these memories also give you an enhanced
card with more information on that
memory and the option to create videos
from that memory as well news also got a
significant update if we could say so it
now looks more like a magazine which is
what it should have done from day one
and at that magazine user interface
you're now even able to get breaking
news notifications which is fine but
Apple spent that's most amount of time
on I message and we're really going to
wrap it up here when it comes to iOS I
message now reminds us of WeChat and
whatsapp and even Google's new messaging
service alo mainly because well now you
are able to provide emotion within your
chat you're now able to provide
different arts and animations new emoji
yeah it reminds us a lot of everything
that's already out there but the reason
why it reminds us of WeChat is because
you're now able to purchase tickets for
example and within group chats you can
even reserve tables within third-party
applications because there's also
support to third-party developers as
well there is a ton of change that's
coming to I message sadly no it's not
going to work on Android but again these
changes are major up to the point where
it leads me to the question of this
video which one of all these services
excites you the most of any what do you
think about apples announcements at WWDC
in my case I am just happy that I'm
finally able to use my Apple watch I
cannot wait to get watch os3 and expect
our beta walkthroughs coming very soon

first impressions video of WWDC 2016
