something hot coming to CES 2015 we give
rumors of what to expect for the second
generation Apple watch and it seems that
Microsoft struggles with meeting surface
tablet demands I'm high metal iveta and
let's just say Tuesday's jokes in the
comments were a little off let's try
wednesday this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with google
the company has been pushing a bevy of
updates to its in-house applications and
has now decided to add some more
features to google calendar believe it
or not even though reminders have
existed on google now and other services
they finally integrate with the calendar
so now you'll be able to see them there
use them there and there are a few cool
tricks with these calendar reminders it
looks so it's looking for full details
on what you're getting here other
official news come from Apple is the
company has just launched the smart
battery case for the iphone 6 and iphone
6s just to acknowledge finally that the
battery life on their smaller iPhones is
just terrible and well it works
differently to others because you really
don't have to turn it on you just
connect it to the phone and then it just
works the problem is that time when you
want to use the battery case and not the
phone's battery and you can't really
select which one is working links in the
description you'll get more details on
this yeah the Apple tax is 99 bucks and
I'm sure you get something better for
that and for all five of you that are
waiting patiently for the next
generation Apple watch now I know there
are probably more of you out there but
it seems that the company is prepping
for this product to be announced in
march along with the iphone 6c or iphone
mini or whatever it's going to be called
according to the trusted sources this
new Apple watch will bring a bevy of new
features and we can expect it to launch
in April and for those of you that want
to know if it's still worth it to buy
the Apple watch the current one are
after the buzz will be live very soon to
tell you just about that as will the
spotlight over to Microsoft as it seems
that the company is struggling to meet
the man that the surface pro 4 and
service book but not necessarily because
they've got this overwhelming amount of
orders but mainly because Intel is not
capable of building enough skylake
processors apparently they're having
some trouble and they won't be able to
fix it until early next year meaning if
you're in the market
a surface pro 4 surface book you might
as well try to get it now before things
get complicated do we recommend these
tablets yes we do they are great tablets
for their price tag and finally for the
very hot news today Samsung has just
sent out press invitations for an event
to happen at CES 2015 finally for the
longest time Samsung has been just
completely absent from CES we've been
covering rumors over the possibility of
Samsung announcing its new Galaxy
smartphones at the press events and it
seems that it will happen that way
apparently we might be getting new
galaxies though we're not sure the
company doesn't really specify exactly
what we're getting as they usually do
when they tell us this is the new
unpacked and they give us a teaser of
what phone we're getting so it does lead
me to the question of the day what would
you want samsung to launch on this
president at CES when you want new
tablets new wearables would you want the
new Galaxy s7 we would love to know in
the comments down below in my case I
would like for the current galaxies to
have a little more life span because
some of them have barely launched but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed be
sure you follow us on parking i'll
comment subscribe trade route channel as
well to follow me on twitter high
matters for a better on instagram at
high never leave it please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw i am hiding i believe it thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
