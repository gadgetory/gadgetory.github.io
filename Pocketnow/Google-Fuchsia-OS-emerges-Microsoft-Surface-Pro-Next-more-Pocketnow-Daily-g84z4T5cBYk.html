from mothballs and shows us an
alternative to Android Apple's Phil
Schiller just shined been on a future
smart speaker that's different
everything else and Microsoft hints two
major changes to the next surface pro
I'm Jaime Rivera and because I had not
read in your comments any sort of
complaints about Monday jokes I assume I
can go back to them this is far get out
daily the official news today begin with
deals the LGB 20 continues to be one of
the smartphones that we recommend most I
highly suggest you watch Juan's latest
after the buzz on the V 20 every single
one of his talking points is the way I
feel about the phone it is an amazing
piece of hardware and there's a trusted
seller on eBay that's got the Sprint
Berrien for just 300 bucks you're not
going to find a better deal on this film
like seriously I want the spotlight over
to Harman Kardon and Microsoft as a well
both companies have just announced their
invoke speaker the problem is everything
that's usual with Microsoft of old that
apparently just came back because this
is a Cortana based speaker I love the
concept of this being a Harman Kardon
speaker that's Cortana enabled it means
that this is not the only brand that
will do it you don't the problem is but
it gets announced today and it won't be
launching until the fall and there's no
price point I mean come on Microsoft
don't pull another Windows 10 mobile
here and speaking of Microsoft we've got
company executives sort of shining in on
the future of the surface pro lineup by
the way the surface pro 4 continues to
be one of my favorite computers out
there and well we hear that the
successor could be called surface pro 5
could be called surface pro next but the
most interesting part is it apparently
well the company is not going to budge
on the price tag what they will do is
budge on innovation and bring something
completely different to this plausible
tablet computer or whatever it's going
to be called I can't wait to see what we
get
now let's move the spotlight again two
speakers but this plan to Apple Phil
Schiller was recently on record an
interview and while being asked what he
thought about devices like Amazon's
Alexa speaker of the echo or for example
Google home he didn't really hint to the
fact that Apple's working on something
but according to him would
really sad about these products is that
they lack a scream there's really no
other way to interact with them but with
voice obviously that's the whole idea
the whole idea is that you only interact
with them with a voice but most of us
that have used devices like Google home
will feel that it would be awesome to
have a separate interface so could it be
that this is what Apple is going to
bring with their Siri speaker and
finally the very hot news they have to
do with something we talked about a year
ago actually more than a year ago do any
of you remember project fuchsia which
was Google's possibility of building yet
another operating system of well it
turns out that we've got some leaked
information on video that shows the
operating system working there's an
image of it that's out there and well
it's completely different to Android but
on a kernel level and pretty much
everything else apparently it's not
going to be using androids linens baek's
kernel apparently is going to be using
its proprietary magenta kernel one to
the user interfaces card based and we're
wondering exactly what the whole point
of this will be if again it's not going
to be based on Android it actually leads
me to the question of the day watch the
video in the link in the description and
tell us what do you think about this do
you think that it's time for another
operating system because in my case I
feel it's not it took forever for other
operating systems like Palm OS or webOS
Windows 10 mobile all these operating
systems to die Symbian as well in order
for two operating system to take the
cake which are ios and android so why do
we need more if these others weren't
able to survive if only because whatever
is coming in project fusion will be so
much better than what we currently have
but not from what we saw in the video
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends you know

news earlier before the videos filmed
