pocket now calm you know back in the
early days of Windows Mobile sliding
devices the ones with slide out
keyboards the screen rotation speed
would always be very very slow to the
point where when you slid out the
keyboard the screen hadn't yet caught up
and you were ready to type a message but
you're still waiting for the screen to
get to the other orientation well let's
changed a lot in the last few years
especially with the HTC touch pro before
that the Titan to took probably three or
four seconds to rotate at times but
thankfully that's been improved so in
this video we're going to compare the
screen rotation speed tests of the new
HTC touch pro2 the last generation HTC
touch pro and the sony ericsson xperia
x1 okay so let's start off with the
touch pro 2 and the touch pro were on
the same screen here in settings let's
see if we can synchronize these to see
which device rotates faster ready set go
all right about the same they're
actually touch pro is faster there try
again and touch pro was faster by about
a half a second there one more time
about the same exactly the same ok
inconclusive let's go with the xperia x1
which previously held the record for the
fastest screen rotation of the sliding
windows mobile devices let's see how it
fares against the HTC touch pro2 ready
almost exactly the same I think the x1
was a tad faster let's do it again
exactly the same exactly the same so
basically this test is inconclusive in
determining which of these devices have
a faster screen rotation it seems that
the screen rotation speed has gotten so
good that by the time that you rotate
the device to use the keyboard when
you're in word mobile or typing a
message the keyboard or the screen is
already rotated and you're ready to go
for example here in word mobile it's
pretty much instant so the touch pro 2
is about the same screen
rotation speed as a freshly hard reset
touch pro which is actually quite a fast
speed so despite it having a larger
higher resolution screen that doesn't
seem to make a difference in how fast
the screen rotates it's almost instant
that's it for the screen rotation speed
test on the HTC touch pro2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
