tablets to the market that doesn't
really mean that we got everything we
wanted there are some talents out there
that still need a lot of work so anyways
I'm high meta meta this is pocket now
these are top five wishes for tablets in
the industry in 2014 number five is more
winning players and this is probably one
of the biggest tech ironies in history
Microsoft invented the category and
they're struggling with it and then
Apple is actually doing a lot more money
than everybody else and that doesn't
necessarily mean that the ipad is the
best tablet now we do have some Samsung
tablets out there that are good but we
need more winning players and even
though Google is doing a good job with
their Nexus lineup and disrupting the
tablet price tag again we need better
tablets we need more winning players we
need more innovation here probably some
better company's new blood you never
know number four is better display is
that this probably should be number one
but anyways it makes sense for you to
have a TV that has 1080p that's you know
a couple of feet away from you and it
makes sense for that to happen as well
for certain computers but it does not
make sense for tablets if these are
media consumption devices you need the
best experience you can't read a
magazine that's all pixelated does it
make any sense so we really need better
displays better image quality these
things should behave like paper or they
should behave like a TV and pretty much
every way but in better quality so stay
tuned we hope to see better displays
here no more 1080p 1080p and tablets
does not make sense number three is
better storage options 16 and eight
gigabytes should die when it comes to
tablets the reason why is because for
example a game on tablets could weigh
around 1.8 1.5 gigs and then probably a
magazine 500 megabytes a movie 3 gigs
and when you think about it a tablet is
something that's supposed to be portable
and that supposed to give you a lot of
great experiences but then again if you
have very limited storage at five
hundred dollars you have to be carrying
a computer to load more stuff on the
tablet and that's when it becomes
pointless and please do not give me the
whole Google Drive or Dropbox story it
really doesn't make sense for tablets
not everybody can afford a 3g or 4g
tablet number two is more reliable
software and we don't have anything
against Windows RT accept whatever we
have to use it and that's really one of
the biggest problems that we have with
certain tablets the fact that you launch
anything on window
RT and it takes ages for it to launch
for example samsung galaxy tab
especially the note lineup that has
multi windows reporting everything it's
really pointless to see everything crash
all the time and we don't really
understand why what is the point of view
having a sort of a supposedly
productivity device sometimes not
necessarily every time having it crash
all the time and this is really one of
the biggest problems and one of the
biggest reasons why iPad sell because
they are probably the most reliable
tablets but not necessarily the best
ones in the top number one thing that we
wish would change for 2014 is more
productivity on tablets and by this I
don't just mean multi-window support
which is a good addition or microsoft
office on a tablet is a good addition
but not necessarily everything there are
a ton of engineering students out there
that can't afford a laptop and a tablet
and we don't just need a big bloated
smartphone when it comes to the tablet
we want a tablet that actually is able
to do a lot of stuff and not everybody
can afford surface pro 2 as well show
again there is this big market of people
out there that want a tablet that can do
everything well and even though there's
really not something you can get right
now or probably in the next five years
we do hope that the whole 64-bit
processor thing will allow us to have
better applications in the future more
powerful application specific to any
specific niche and not just running
office on tablets again that's not
everything but that leads us to the
question of this top five what would you
add what would you wish for it for
tablets in 2014 because in my particular
case again I don't really like carrying
and tablet and a computer but I have to
right now because both can't really do
the same thing well but anyways it is a
comment down below what's your case
that's it for today's top five thank you
