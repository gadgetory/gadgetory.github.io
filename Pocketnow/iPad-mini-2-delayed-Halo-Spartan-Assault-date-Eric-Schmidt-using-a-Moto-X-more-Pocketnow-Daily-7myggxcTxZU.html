rumoured as the late for 2014 halo
Spartan assault game for windows phone 8
gets launched details and Google's Eric
Schmidt the scene modeling the white
Moto X I'm hi Mary meta and I'm torn
between being drunk this weekend they're
working out this is out daily
let's start stay off with someone
expected in early news as sony has to
send out press invitations for the
ribbon to happen at Aoife which is two
months away and still it's interesting
that Sony's already letting people know
that they're gonna have something hot
last year they launched a couple of
experience the experience here the
xperia j which never really took off but
this year they've got the Sony Honami up
their sleeve and apparently this phone
will have a huge Gigantor phablet
display along with a 20 megapixel camera
so stay tuned for this one as it'll
probably be the next fabul you'll buy
now let's talk about the Nokia Lumia
1020's we know that pre-orders begin on
July sixteenth but if you order the
spoon on the microsoft store online the
company is giving out a limited amount
of camera grips for the phone then
that's 80 bucks so that's pretty good
deal stay tuned for that 1n aside from
that if you're interested in that camera
pro software that's coming to the Lumia
1020 well no key just confirmed that
it's coming to the Nokia Lumia 920 the
925 at the 928 just don't ask me when
speaking of Windows Phone we don't know
why Microsoft has taken so long to bring
halo into their smartphone platform but
the game is going to be called the halo
Spartan assault it's going to cost you
seven dollars and will be available
later this month but with a catch sadly
it's going to be exclusive for verizon
during the first coming weeks and we
don't know when it's gonna be available
for everybody else so stay tuned if
you're on Verizon speaking of verizon
we've got some leaked photographs of the
Moto X running on their 4g LTE network
which is kind of interesting since we've
got the motorola droid ultra lineup also
coming to verizon don't know how that's
going to play out but interesting we've
got some more leaks about some special
materials coming for faceplates for this
phone probably we're getting wood
ceramic materials and we're not sure if
those are really credible but we've got
Eric Schmidt on photographs using the
Moto
X and white and it looks like some sort
of ceramic so stay tuned on how that's
going to play out and finally for the
sad news of the day credible reports
have the next generation iPad Mini being
slated as delayed until early 2014 we
were expecting this tablet to make their
yearly cycle and be available by October
or sometime within the fall of this year
but apparently there will be two models
of the iPad many one with a Retina
display and one without it which is a
interesting to see why that's going to
happen and still obviously we are going
to have the ipad 5 that'll probably be
launched within the fall not sure why
this delay is happening most probably
because of that retina display module
but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day what is your next
tablet for this year what are your plans
or which tablet do you want to buy in my
case I have two tablets on my eyesight
one would be the iPad 5 and the other
would be the future generation Nexus 7

tablet and you know the drill for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
