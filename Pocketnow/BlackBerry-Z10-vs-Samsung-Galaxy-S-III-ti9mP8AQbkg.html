successful Android smartphones ever with
over 40 million units sold how does the
new BlackBerry stack up against the
Samsung heavyweight let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is blackberry z10 vs. samsung
galaxy s3 some caveats real quick our
galaxy s3 here is the version for
Verizon Wireless so it's packin a
different set of guts than the
international version also the Galaxy S
series runs Samsung's proprietary
TouchWiz scan atop Android so this
comparison only applies to Samsung build
Android devices most specifically of
course the galaxy s3
now just like yesterday's Lumia 920
comparison we're going to compare these
devices in terms of hardware software
ecosystem and camera if you missed
yesterday's video avoid missing future
ones subscribe and follow us in the
links in the description down below
jumping right into hardware we'll go
ahead and get specs out of the way first
so get out your notepads and your
calculators our American galaxy s3 here
is packing the dual-core Qualcomm s4
running at 1.5 gigahertz and backed up
by 2 gigs of ram but most global
versions use the quad core Exynos
processor and a single gig of ram those
differences aside the galaxy s3 comes
with either 16 32 or 64 gigs of on-board
storage expandable up to an additional
64 gigs using microSD expansion the
situation on the z10 is a little simpler
the version blackberry has announced are
unlocked variant here sports a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor backed up
by 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of on-board
storage that's also expandable via
microSD up to an additional 64 gigs of
storage and there's LTE onboard here as
well with the exception of onboard
storage then these two units are fairly
well matched but there are some rather
visible differences to start with the
2100 milliamp power pack on the galaxy
s3 is significantly larger than the 1800
milliamp hour battery on the blackberry
fortunately both are removable for quick
swapping the displays are fundamentally
different as well the galaxy s3 is 4.8
inch Super AMOLED panel Dwarfs the
blackberries of 4.2 inch LCD and it
delivers more saturate
colors and deeper blacks the
blackberries screen though offers higher
pixel density a higher resolution
overall and depending on your own
personal hardware build it's more
manageable with one hand it's not
shielded by Gorilla Glass
due to its so-called touch on lens
display technology but it is sunk ever
so slightly below the bezel hopefully
that will provide some protection
against drops that leads us into build
quality where the difference in design
is striking these are both thin light
smartphones separated only by a half
millimeter in thickness and four grams
in weight but they feel completely
different in the hand the galaxy s3 with
its slick smooth plastics and wide
radius corners feels and looks like the
pebble Samsung intended but compromises
in the design like this fake brushed
metal border give it a cheap appearance
from some angles the blackberry by
contrast is a study in straight lines
aggressive right angles and hard
unyielding plastics the soft touch back
cover is stippled and easy to grip the
buttons are machined stainless steel and
this device as a whole feels solid much
more so than its Samsung contemporary
the blackberry features the same NFC
capability as the s3 and sadly the same
lack of wireless charging support out of
the box but it does include a dedicated
HDMI out port in lieu of requiring an
adapter BlackBerry's new OS is rather
unlike anything on the market and that
definitely includes Android 4.1.1
running underneath the TouchWiz nature
UX by now we're all familiar with
androids interface paradigm the app
drawer the notification shade and most
visibly the multiple home screens full
of rearranged will short cuts icons and
widgets the Android OS is the most
customizable major mobile platform on
the market even right out of the box you
can pretty much arrange your home
screens any way you want that's not the
case on BlackBerry 10 which locks you
into the new blackberry way of doing
things there is the familiar app drawer
off to the right but the home screen is
dominated by a collection of currently
running apps shown in minimized boxes
called active frames these can act like
widgets
if the developer has built that
functionality in which is cool if not
they just appear as static snapshots of
applications which is less cool apps can
be opened or closed right from this view
similar to androids built-in
multitasking ribbon but the difference
with bb10 is that the task manager isn't
hidden in a separate area it's at the
heart of the experience in lieu of
androids notification shade is the
BlackBerry hub which lives off to the
left side of the active frames and
aggregates all notifications into a
single view third-party apps like gtalk
also make use of the hub after they're
installed so you have one big unified
inbox it's also true of androids
notification shade and so is the ability
to peek at messages while not leaving
the app you're currently in but the
devices do it differently you swipe down
from the top bezel on Android while you
swipe up from the bottom bezel and then
to the right for more detail on bb10 the
shortcut toggles that Samsung has put
into its notification shade aren't in
the hub on blackberry instead they're
available by swiping down from the top
on the z10 that top swipe isn't confined
to the home screen either executing it
in an app usually calls up the apps menu
or settings and swiping left or right
serves the function of a back key on the
buttonless blackberry experience swiping
up from the bottom always returns you to
the home screen and it also unlocks the
device if you don't want to use the
power standby key up top and of course
there's the gesture based keyboard which
allows you to flick words up into your
document right from under your thumb
sure you can download any keyboard you
want on an Android device but blackberry
really developed something special with
its text input on the z10 over all the
platform's heavily gesture-based
interface method takes longer to get
used to but after a while it feels more
fluid than using the galaxy s3s back and
menu keys and big clunky physical home
button
unfortunately that fluidity comes at a
cost in the form of stability whenever
you have a brand new OS fighting against
an entrenched competitor on its fourth
major revision you're going to see a
reliability trade-off and that's the
case with blackberry 10 a good example
is that of the browser which supports
flash and does OK in the SunSpider
JavaScript benchmark at 16 80
milliseconds but which still stutters
and drag
during page loads more than the galaxy
s3s stock browser bb10 is still a very
young OS and it still has its share of
bugs that Android has had plenty of time
to eliminate we dinged blackberry for
its app selection relative to Windows
Phone and yesterday's review so you can
imagine how this portion of the
comparison will go in short Android has
over 10 times the number of available
apps in the Google Play Store as
blackberry does in its app world and
Google also offers much more multimedia
content the Google Play Store is a
mature thriving market that any new
smartphone contender would be
hard-pressed to compete with and of
course blackberry is nowhere near it
that said blackberry did come strong out
of the gate announcing relationships
with big-name app vendors and managing
to woo developers into building or
porting over 70,000 apps for the
platform at launch yeah many are
knock-offs
and there are significant holes massive
gaps really so if you're someone who
relies on a solid third-party app
ecosystem it'll be a long time before
bb10 catches up with your needs but
BlackBerry has shown that it's not going
to settle for a stagnant app and content
store so it is definitely worth keeping
an eye on an ecosystem isn't just about
apps though and if you're a Google user
nine times out of ten you're still going
to want to stick with an Android product
blackberry will interface just fine with
your email calendar and contact but
Google has innovated and integrated so
much on the Android side with apps like
Google now that you're really missing
out on a lot of the Google experience by
carrying any other device even after
months and months on the market the
galaxy s3 still packs one of the better
smartphone cameras out there
it delivers good results with
appropriate color balance and contrast
and even does fairly well in low light
and rather challenging shooting
environments thanks to an elaborate
suite of settings and options in the
viewfinder software it does tend to err
on the warm side though and Samsung is
not the only one who knows how to be
clever in terms of camera software as
blackberry proved when it built in its
face detection and time travel element
kind of a mix of samsung's best photo
and best face features it's still a
fairly bare-bones interface though the
pictures does eat
and generates bar also not that great
compared to the sgs3 it tends to err on
the cool side and it's too aggressive
with auto exposure and white balance it
loses a lot of detail on textures and
its capture area isn't as wide in terms
of 8 megapixel smartphone shooters the
z10 isn't bad per se but we definitely
prefer the SGS 3s camera at our side if
we were going to take a lot of photos
watch for our BlackBerry z10 video
sample coming soon
while blackberry the company is part of
the old guard blackberry the smartphone
specifically the z10 is the new kid on a
block full of very seasoned players if
you're ok with that
and the bugs that come along with it and
you favor an excellent unified messaging
experience and the corporate security
features blackberry was built to excel
at the z10 will suit you fine while
delivering a fresh new user experience
to boot if customization and stability
is more your bag with a rich ecosystem
and the tightest Google integration
available not to mention a very good
camera and a solid software package
overall the galaxy s3 running Android
4.1 will probably be the better fit it's
going to do it for this one folks hope
you enjoyed the video if you did throw
us a like here on YouTube follow us in

stay tuned for our full BlackBerry z10
review coming in the following days and
thanks for watching we'll see you next
