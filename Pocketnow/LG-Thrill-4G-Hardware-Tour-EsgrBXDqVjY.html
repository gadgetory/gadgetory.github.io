calm and we are going to look at the
hardware tour of the LG through 4g on
AT&amp;amp;T it's very similar to the LG optimus
3d so it's going to be a lot of
similarities there let's get to it
first off we've got this device it's a
one gigahertz dual-core texas
instruments omap 4 processor with a
power of ER 5 g x 540 GPU 512 megs of
ram 8 gigs of ram storage and it also
comes with an eight gig micro SD card
i'll show you that in a minute the
screen is a glasses-free
autostereoscopic 3d 800 x 480 pixel
resolution and it's a 4.3 inch size
there the 3d content only works in
landscape mode so we'll check that out
first let's look at the hardware some
more at the top here we have a 1.3
megapixel front facing camera and under
there there's some light sensors and
proximity sensor there's your speaker
grill the bottom we have our capacitive
buttons there's the menu home back and
search it's very difficult to feel if if
the back light goes off and it's dark
you can't mean three hard to find them
there's a nice little brushed metal lip
down there over here we have the micro
USB port underneath the flap
as you can see that there and there's
also the HDMI out port and this device
does come with an adapter so you can
really easily plug that into an HDTV so
its up that man there's nothing over
here we have a microphone and a little
slot to remove the battery cover over
here is the 3d button and volume up and
down button the 3d button only works
really when you're in the camera so if i
press it is just going to launch this 3d
space thing and i press it again it's
not going to do anything so but if I go
into the camera it's going to switch
between 2d mode and 3d mode see that
little switch there I press again
switches in the way it's not it doesn't
work as a camera shutter even though
it's in the place where that should be
okay moving on at the top was our power
button and a secondary noise
cancellation microphone and the 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the back we
have 2 5 megapixel cameras for
stereoscopic 3d imaging and recording
and there's our LED flash in the middle
and it says three circus topics like a
little metal and there's your house
speaker and it says 18t right there
thanks you're being logo ok let's open
it up that peels off like that and here
we have a fifteen hundred million per
hour battery I'll leave that in there
there's your SIM card slot and here's
your microSD slot and it's a little
tricky you got to slide this little
piece of metal and then it opens like
that and you can put that thing this is
this comes pre-installed a don't really
have to finagle with that you just know
that it's there
so then we have our Hardware tour of the
LG thrill 4g stay tuned for more on the
software that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
