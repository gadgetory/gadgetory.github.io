tablet emerged a galaxy frame device
also rumored for CES 2013 an HTC
scratches some phones from their future
plans I'm hi meri behna and according to
those who think they know the Mayans
were two days away from dark use X movie
this is pocket out daily let the 2013
rumor mill begin this time because we
have nokia and a possible tablet to be
built sometime within the year probably
CES 2013 with a launch date or probably
you never know could be mwc we're not
sure on those launch dates but this
rumor of a tablet made by nokia is
actually quite old and before they
started building tablets i wish they
figured out how to sell phones but we'll
see what happens and samson makes rumor
number two because this time we have a
probable device called the samsung
galaxy frame to be released now what
could be a phone that's also called the
frame look at that stand for the only
thing could be that sammy probably
already figured out a way to make this
phone without a bezel or it could just
be that it's a tablet that could also be
used as a frame we're not really sure
CES 2013 is a problem launch date and
we'll keep you posted now it's not a
rumor and always well received the
software updates t-mobile recently
launched the software update for their
windows phone 8x to comply with the
international variant so make sure you
download that and then after microsoft
recently launched the full software
upgrade to OEMs nokia has just comply
with their Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 yes
this up that includes enhancements to
the camera performance so it is
important for you to upgrade right now
now the biggest rumor integ is a Retina
Display ipad mini and every time that
I'm reading these news in my pix elated
iPad Mini i get pissed off analysts
already believe that Apple will launch
this device sometime in mid-2013 and
we're already assuming that they could
probably still have their March ipad
event as they've had ever since the
first generation ipad even though that
was in February but still the reddit
display is coming we're not really sure
if the new ipad or retina display ipad
will change in design we're assuming so
and we will keep you posted and finally
for the depressing news of the day HTC
seems to already be taking some measures
in order to deal with their economical
strains they
had some terrible quarters lately and
digit time is already reporting that
they're dropping some phones from their
2013 lineup obviously because they have
economical issues and that leads you to
the question of the day wouldn't you
prefer for HTC to build just one device
one phone that would be perfect that
would be hot and that would have
everything that the market wants well if
Apple could pull this off I don't
understand why HTC can't do it so leave
us a comment down below will you prefer
a ton of devices or just one I would
prefer one and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow was on pocketnow.com
please make sure you give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
venom thanks for watching and stay tuned
tomorrow as we go through the Samsung a
team that's review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
