morning good afternoon good evening
everybody and welcome to episode 11 of
the bucket now live excuse my voice this
is still a reminiscence a souvenir from
Vegas I'm ads on front pocket now and
joining me today my brother and arms
from Vegas who doesn't sound pretty much
different than I do Taylor welcome to
the show thanks for having me oh it
sounds a little bit better yeah I feel a
little better but I still have a cough
and the man that keeps everything
rolling well we are getting sick in
vegas or anywhere else Stephen welcome
hey hey i feel kind of bad for not
getting sick now don't worry i'll jerk
I'll go lick some door knobs or
something I'll get the process going
guys i will i will stop talking soon
because you get just crazy my boy
because of my voice so I'll just hand it
over Stephen the cameras locked on you
why don't you just start talking to
somebody well I should dive right in
here how about Eric I see you there your
headphones on how you hit her what's
going on tomorrow where you colonists
are calling us where you hang in with us
from our go here for a second there I
think we lost audio I was probably yeah
because it was working so well but it's
what second there I thought we were
gonna be off to a pocket now live
without any weird have related
difficulties but that would be asking
far far too much can you turn your audio
up I'm wearing headphones I can barely
hear you Stephen I can hear just fine
like Eric I couldn't hear them at all
they're from yeah I mean here Eric can
you say something yeah I can barely sir
yea yea I can't your levels are very
very low all right so why don't you see
if you can't turn your microphone gain
up a bit uh maybe we will try jumping
back to you at a moment if see if we can
hear you better but let's keep things
moving right along here how about Billy
they're right next to you Billy can we
hear you
if you'll have two onions ourselves
scary oh and that third area speakers
your plugins like it such a such a
screen for feedback oh sorry about that
is that good no they were so cute all
right okay no I'm Mac Mac Z this is good
I'm getting a lot of comments on YouTube
videos which we both really good audio
problems I'm gonna just tell once again
everybody that this is not a scripted
show this is a live show we have no
control over who's joining or what they
are talking about or what they are about
to say and what gear they are using so
just bear with us it just scratches our
brain just like it scratches yours so
we're sorry once again for it but this
is the way a live show happens on
youtube so Billy I needed you but I'm
going to unmute you back once you get
your headphones on just wave to me okay
hmm all right let me see okay and you
should be unmuted or at least that's
what my okay now say something okay can
you hear me now a daughter or a day
difference yes perfect okay I'm not mad
about that I'm just trying to use my
laptop someday they'll protect their
camp perfect uh noise cancelling
microphones on that couch but until then
headphones good do the job of a page LOL
today okay close your laptop of course
of course everyone will have their
Chromebook instead of a proper laptop
with things like local storage and all
sorts of bells and whistles but that's
neither here or there anyway huh Billy
hi where are you talking to us problem
um honestly I'm from the most bipolar
state in the u.s. AKA Florida Oh Florida
ara our friend Michael is headed down to
Florida right now for a nice little
refreshing vacation so you're in good
company I assuming he stopped in
Jacksonville but that's not likely who
knows and oh is a mystery wrapped and
then they come i wrapped in some spiky
hair and yellow glass
what are you had talked about yesterday
arm actually this kind of the few months
back i believe it was in the beginning
of november there was a podcast that
specifically dealt with smartphones
through the eyes of the blind right
right and myself i'm actually visually
impaired myself though I thought maybe I
could kind of give some insight there
was a really good question on there that
was asking about is their smartphones
developed specifically for the blind or
visually impaired and yes erin was
partially right as far as like iOS being
good for people who are totally blind
because of voiceover and stuff but like
if you're visually impaired but you
still have some usable eyesight to where
you can use a smartphone without very
many accessibility site um settings
absolutely the Galaxy Note series
whether Samsung intentionally made it
for that purpose which I doubt very
seriously but that is the Galaxy Note
devices are honestly the most perfect
device listen is because they have a
huge screen or is it because they have
some sort of settings which you can
enable in order to help you read the
information on the screen just refuge
screen just because of the you scream
yes I'm surprised to hear that mean it
makes a lot of sense if you're not
completely visually impaired you still
have some degree of functionality left
larger Texas you know we're gonna be
easier to read so do you find tablets if
you have a tablet do you understand
preferably over a phone um depends on
the circumstance because honestly yes I
prefer tablets but it's just one more
device to carry around and right now I
would be using a galaxy note I had a
note to for like eight months but i just
cannot stand TouchWiz so that what if we
have like a google play edition
or what about him you're consuming it or
something if there was a google play
edition note 3 I would actually have
that over my nexus 5 i'll listen up
google there's a market for this I mean
seriously the note i obviously samsung
doesn't market it that way but reality
is if you're visually impaired and you
have some usable vision and regis way to
go because apple cannot seem doesn't
really seem to care to make a bigger
screen or at least not for a moment yeah
well yeah it's coming this year
hopefully i mean if they make a 4.7 inch
iphone yeah that's a bit small my sweet
spot is five inches but they make a 4.7
inch iphone when i'm probably going to
camp out for it because i'm hearing up
there could also be one at five inch
range it has been this talk of possibly
two models we might get one super small
one and one like in the 45 you're
talking about but their dimension of a
phablet so who knows yeah but yeah
question i am flipping through the
settings of my gs4 and I'm betting that
the settings of the note 3 are the same
there is a setting within the display
options for font size from the tiniest
to the hugest largest do you find
yourself often using that I'm going to
try to show it off i'm not sure if it on
say anything that question yes I do even
on my Nexus 5 I use the large font size
just because it makes everything more
readable but also I do a lot of gaming
and a lot of I do pretty much everything
on my phone so you know big screen just
make some sense they're doing everything
that much easier you now would you carry
something like the was it the one who
only looks so much which one the fonepad
the move the Megas the phone pad oh yeah
on if they had the specs of the Nexus 5
and yes because I'm absolutely loving my
nexus 5 right now the the tab 8.4 we saw
that a pro 8.4 we saw at CES that's got
extraordinary specs yeah
that that is a very nice tablet if they
can get that into a LTE version to work
on tmobile within reasonable price so
long as it has that speaker on it I
would carry here to say to won't but but
you might be able to get one from
overseas yeah in fact it easy if i had
the money i would have the gpe on z
ultra right now no yeah for that phone
just gives me nightmares I just I can't
deal with the film epic I can't do it it
it is huge but at the same time like I
said I am visually impaired but i do
have enough usable vision to where i can
still play games and stuff like that and
just use the phone how it should be used
for gaming media consumption so z ultra
is like my dream device Billy you
shouldn't you should really mind Taylor
because she used the Z ultra all the way
as a tray for his bed and breakfast show
just haha and if I i wish the nexus 7
LTE had a speaker yeah that'd be nice
but here in the states it's like taboo
having a speaker on a tablet because we
were talking about the weekly last week
or this week no it was last week Michael
and I were talking about how Samsung PR
agent was telling us know when Michael
was holding it up to his face now he was
like please don't please don't well so
and that's also thing too is it general
people like that aren't visually
impaired I mean being a visual impaired
it's kind of a minority yeah and in your
case it's definitely something that
would probably be beneficial or useful
more certain and to someone like me who
just likes the display size oh
definitely I can't keep stop thinking
about one of the last stories I cover
and yesterday was about the LG G flex
and there's I don't know if it's a a
problem with manufacturing or if this
was intentional but we've seen it still
having these tiny little bumps on the
display when it's folded wouldn't it be
bizarre if they could somehow
harness that and make a display that
intentionally deforms like that and it
could like have Braille right on the
screen I mean I can't recognize
accessibility that's amazing last year's
a company yeah yeah go ahead there's a
company called tactus who actually is
working on that because they were trying
their their initial goal was to bring
tactility to typing on a display but
they have this display technology which
raises and lowers and uses a vibration
to actually mimic tactility not you know
the haptic feedback that we get it's
actually supposed to mimic because the
screen actually does move yes that's
crazy speaking of haptic feedback
honestly as cited smartphone users how
often do you use have to feedback it is
the first thing I always turn off ever
really I like you as soon as I set up a
phone I don't even make it through the
setup process usually I go into keyboard
settings turn off haptic feedback and as
soon as I get through them I go to
settings and go to sound and turn off
I'm looking for me I'm right in the
middle between the two of you because
Steven uses it and I use it on some
phones and I disabled on other phones I
use it on the HTC One and I've got a
disabled on the gs4 don't ask me why and
it feels Hollow on samsung devices it
makes the toys feel hollow oh yeah i
mean the reason i was asking this
because i can't see using a phone
without haptic feedback because being
that they're all touchscreen to be added
to have a vibration to know what I'm
touching kind of helps out makes it
easier yeah all right anything else you
wanted to bring up with us we have you
on this board and Billy uh not that i
can think of at the moment I'm just glad
to finally been able to make it on
because I've been trying to sense that
whole kind of thing that's weird you
finally guys yeah you had some very
interesting stuff to start this pot of
podcast to hang out out with I think
we're off to a hot start
long shoulders yeah I'm going to go see
what other people have to say all right
well let's keep moving here before we do
is there any way people can say hiding
others up eating outside Kiki's a
miniature pinscher and chihuahua mix
well hey there um you can find me on
google+ at Billy Thompson or my facebook
is also Billy Thompson I mean you find
my facebooking gonna hold my number I
wouldn't care just don't harass me up
just do the rest of it but I'm you guys
totally when you're saying like I
actually do have one question that comes
to mind yes you um what would be some
advice as far starting at the YouTube
channel because honestly over the last
like few years because of the note line
and how amazing it is for people who
with visual impaired or whatever I've
been kind of thinking about starting a
YouTube channel doing tech review
through the eyes of the blind well that
it that that looks like an awesome idea
and I as far as i know i haven't seen
any other tech channels out there who
talk about that so my advice for you
would be the first to do something
interesting which other peoples have not
done before and this is exactly what
well it looks like you're up to so if
you have a dislike to start that good
luck with it the best advice I can offer
make videos because you can talk about
and think about it but it unless you get
out there and physically do it it won't
ever you want you won't know if it's
going to be popular or not so you have
to start somewhere start by actually
doing those if I someone gave me do
instead of think and don't let
commenters bring you down oh yes oh just
ignore them ignore they have hundred not
unlock the I think we lost him I think
yeah all right food let us move on
apparently he got the information he
needed over we eating for that is my
snares Ian Stefan Taylor back to you I'm
gonna
my voice yeah i'm gonna see if eric has
audio yet or if he's fixed is Mike um
hello yes it's much fun nice and loud
yeah how are you Eric today I'm good I'm
I'm very tired oh yes drunk muffin now I
remember you I can't hello nobody can't
forget so where are you calling in from
again um Sydney Australia that's right
that's right that explains why you're so
tired yeah let's meet a as well give it
to 10 you are you okay I'm not talking
though I'm hearing my voices yes alright
so do you have any questions for us
specifically starting with yes EES
because that one yeah yeah one reason
Tony had me come on the show today um ok
so what device actually managed to last
you longer since AES are all like the 50
devices yander because it's funny
because most of them just said in the
bag and stayed on standby most the time
i had an iphone 5 and moto x in my
pockets Michael carried a note 3 and
Tony you had a galaxy s4 right yes for
in a 1020 yeah yeah and Michael had a
1020 of all those if I were to just
guess I would probably say the Nexus
they're not Nexus the note 3 probably
lasted longer than everything the Moto X
actually did very well with stamina I
was going a day and a half on a charge
so I was happy with that but I'm sure
Michael probably outlast us all he also
got two spare batteries from Samsung
while we were there so there's also yes
you'll sad like 400 power banks like I
was lots of you anxious yeah we always
have I don't go anywhere without at
least two yeah were you at Ellery you
get to see the huawei which one was it
the one that could charge the other
phones with thee the measurements but
someone insta mute they're like who am i
hearing
sir I'm doing not hearing a knock dude
in here Mike well everybody's muted yeah
I'm not hearing any feedback I am maybe
it's just you talking about the ascend
mate to bury every oh yeah the one that
could charge the other devices mmm we're
getting a lot of flak from people in the
comments like why would anyone even
consider something like this but it's a
heretic losing friend in your face yeah
because I have a friend who's needy and
what he used to do he doesn't do it
anymore what he used to do is he had a
two hundred megabyte plan on AT&amp;amp;T and I
had unlimited data on t-mobile so what
we would do is we'd go to a restaurant
we're sitting there and he's like hey
can you turn on your tethering so I
would he would use my data and we would
sit there and have dinner and he's the
same kind of person that be like hey can
you give me some of your phone's charged
I like he's he's that kind of guy I feel
bad like visit I've been that guy in the
Wi-Fi tethering situation I never had a
clone I wouldn't see myself using it
that way but I'm always carrying two
phones so i would probably see myself
because i love the lumia 1020 and i
can't say this enough but i hate windows
phone and not as a hate hate but as in
the fact that i hate that i cannot do
the things which I want to do with it
like for instance my workflow in Vegas
was to snap pictures with the 1020
Bluetooth them over to my gs4 and upload
from my gs4 because of my gs4 i have g
plus i have facebook pages and so on so
i would see myself carrying the mate 2
and using that to charge my secondary
phone my 1020 once the charge dropped so
this might work for me but i would never
charge my friends phone or or somebody
else's phone at the table because that's
just I think lay right yeah I'm not
gonna get home Josh charge yes it's a
good idea in theory but nobody's going
to give up their own battery power we
love it too much and it's too scarce it
phones were lasting three or four days I
can see where that would help but right
now it doesn't yeah if we're getting
like kindle level on battery lasts and
i'm sure everyone was sharing the
battery life everywhere but yeah sadly
we can barely last night
whatever happened to that phone with the
dual screens it had that Ian display on
the back it was coming out of Russia
notable yotaphone yeah they launched him
a few weeks ago no not that I saw but
they did launch a few weeks back or a
few months ago yeah they announced it in
in Prague and I think a thief a last
year and they made it available i think
for pre-orders recently like the end of
last year and that should start shipping
soon i hope that guy catches on it's not
going to but I mean it's just I love to
see innovation like that yeah I agree um
Eric do you have any other questions oh
yeah necessarily about ces but I'm um
how you have headphones what up others
the audio técnicas yeah 8am 480 I've
ordered them and they come again sir I
should yes I'm going so happy these are
fantastic headphones i absolutely love
them and also never go anywhere without
these so yeah um yeah um about that dick
vbac thing that are the previous caller
had I kind of love the haptic feedback
on the Nexus 5 it's the best I've ever
had um like it's just it's just so
perfect it feels so good in the hand
when you compared to like I my HTC One X
that terrible haptic feedback so just
just my two cents yeah there there is
definitely a difference there is a good
haptic feedback and a bad hectic
feedback in and I've always found that
those really really plasticky phones
from Samsung LG all those different
companies when you when you use the
haptic feedback that you can kind of
hear it and it's kind of tinny because
the phones seem and feel hollow and it's
just the same with like I remember with
the optimus g pro i believe it was that
a reviewed when you click the home
button it would you could kind of hear
it like kind of Clank inside and you
would long press on the display or
something it would you could hear it it
was like really it was almost like being
in a like a tunnel and yelling that
little faint echo that you get yeah
was really bad terrible it's like the
old free-kick cat stocks announced ah oh
yeah that's horrible ok let us move on
unless you have yeah final question for
us Eric I had like 50 questions about an
hour ago one more no I forgotten
everything else probably best to move it
all I think hey well thanks for joining
us you want to tell everybody where they
can follow you and find you on on the
social media space yes I'm on I'm on
Twitter so you can follow me at drunk
underscore muffin and yeah i mean that's
practically what the 1i keeper public i
might be psychic block soon but uh maybe
oh ow I'll be on my tour so yeah all
right well everyone follow eric did
drunk drunk underscore muffin and we
look forward to seeing you again soon
maybe next week yeah maybe you can
resist big question yeah a little next
time i should be that but I'm brain dead
today and I I was gonna go to sleep
until soul pocketnow alive and I was
like oh I can't miss this I missed the
last two economist this one sleep can
wait always the sleepers will be saving
up for us alright see you guys fill out
they take care of here I by Stephen back
to you please yeah low you win all the
way on the left here how's it going
you're good we can't hear you can you
turn up your volume ii say something
testing you just have bad luck with a
student
oh man I just bad you're right I'm curse
this morning oh my lord sorry my cat is
tearing up my office behind me here and
I can't tell if the noises I'm hearing
are the audio coming interrupted or my
cat jumping and knocking down things
sorry oh god no audio so do you want to
check here that's your microphone and
we'll come back to you in a minute well
at least be in here he's home unit okay
how about I'm seeing Abdullah jumping
around a lot here over on the left here
a video is second ago but I lost it now
just your converse with the first huh I
heard him hello I think you did not that
was like a problem oh you okay sir a bad
luck I'm sorry week your audio is coming
and incredibly distorted uh I've got no
audio give me neither i have an hour
audio coming back to us like it's going
through a kazoo I was about to ask
feeling does your does your cat have
some radioactive or something die not
it's all right uh why don't you please
mute unless you can get some headphones
or something because this feedback is
going to be a a non-starter all right
let's try again with someone else how
about Tiago hey hey all right headphones
on nice touch no feedback ringing yeah
yeah you're coming through loud and
clear oh oh okay oh nothing much well
there is one thing I'm really interested
in and I'd like to hear Taylor's take on
it um a phone that max I'll hear very
well the Sony Xperia z1 compact third
where is where is here for everyone's
edification South Africa all right nice
South Africa yes so yeah the z1 compact
was
yet we actually saw them setting it up
before they announced it they had
everything under wraps at the sony booth
and they were were about to get on stage
and announce everything and for whatever
reason right before they did they lifted
the glue the cover and then they lifted
this glass thing over it and they
rearranged all the phones and tablets in
this little case and then covered it
back up like oh we didn't just show you
everything so we kind of knew what was
happening we knew there was some
colorful tiny foam coming out but we
didn't know anything about it and or
officially I guess I shouldn't say and
when they announcement it was actually
pretty well received um everybody seems
to love it so far it's what a lot of
people have been asking for a true
miniature flagship hmm yeah i mean i've
got i've got my sony ericsson xperia arc
also 4.3 inches so it's not something i
have to get used to a different size or
something like that it's something that
i'm potentially looking forward to
especially that Snapdragon 800 I think
it's two gigs of RAM it's it's a fun at
the miniature phone without compromise
and that's what everyone has been
waiting for yeah because HTC Samsung LG
and everyone making miniature phones
they always seem to think that small
phone should be inferior to the large
ones 2013 was better than a lot of them
had been as far as those mini models
went but I mean yeah almost all of them
were still downgrading some spec or
another yeah with the HTC one mini that
what had a Snapdragon 400 I can't
remember but I know it didn't have the
same Snapdragon 600 as the HTC One yeah
what's up I'm sorry yeah Sonny could you
please mute your microphone we still
nagging at him for you there we go thank
you so do you like to ask me anything
about the z1 compact or or anything else
in particular well you said you want to
hear my take on it yeah exactly i was
wondering what what you thought about it
because as I've said it's something the
whole industry has been waiting for some
people
unlock these huge phones where Samsung
specially I've seen they've been pushing
especially with the S line and what they
end with a Nightline huge phones and
some people just want a decent-sized
thing but they don't want bad specs and
Sony's here to answer that yeah that is
it just the first miniature no
compromise smartphone in the display
fortunately is improved from from their
previous models which were they were
okay like the illiteracy under those
circumstances what under those
circumstances with poor lighting and
spotlights on the phones will have to
see in our labs how they compare and how
they fare yeah that is true that is true
don't ask me to compare the display
because apparently i'm biased against
Sony and hey the Xperia Z ultra but uh
if you if you don't understand the arena
comments the ultra is understandable
that thing are passed by by a solo hello
the other day and it's huge it's right
too big it's a tablet to get bone and
too small to be a tablet and it's not
exactly a phablet so I think your little
brother is kind of its kind of video
bothering you right now mr. new video
yeah he does it that's my brother you
know it's funny to make sure about
phablets being such a particular device
size and for some people you obviously
yeah it's hard to understand how it's
something that size might be useful it's
weird though that the smart companies
are releasing devices in this range but
they're ignoring more or less ignoring
what you were talking about the other
side be smaller than normal bones it's
why are they these are just two
different opinions bigger long why is
this big one that they're gravitating
towards it's us yeah it's like the
entire car industry would stop making
like miniature compact cars and only
making Hummers you know like it just
doesn't make sense to me trucks and
Hummers he must look like that yeah
that's what it's been and and if you
want a smaller compact car it's like you
have a smart car that's your only choice
a smart car
or a truck or a Hummer are you gotta
cool it right two doors away to go yeah
but it's it's nice to see them appeal to
or start appealing to other consumers
who don't necessarily want a large phone
like me I've been very happy with the
Moto X and it's obviously not a large
foam and that's the other thing the
phone you have now the Xperia Arc um
somebody just beautiful is anyone
allowed to mute us yeah okay find him in
the list here we go I got it okay yeah
okay so what I'm saying is when you're
comparing this z1 compact to your Xperia
Arc I don't know what the actual
footprint size of the xperia arc is but
for some reason i believe that this one
is going to be smaller physically than
the definitely a yeah yeah the
difference is i think this one is gonna
be thicker I don't know for sure I
remember the arc being a pretty thin
phone I don't know the specs on that
point seven millimeter thick 8.7 dark
yes well the z1 compact is like 9.2 9.5
but problem self why doesn't Google
Hangouts do the same thing which you did
for such a long time to meet all my
fault yeah that'd be nice hates us it
does it does today it hates you
especially Steven I don't know what I
did but yeah I think 4.3 inches is
probably a little small for me but for
someone who wants a smaller phone it's
definitely I think the frontrunner for a
compact smartphone well i was thinking
about either that or yeah meant
something much bigger better anything
that i was thinking of the nexus 5 which
is a good phone even though it's not
available in my region but a friend of
mine from school just just got one i saw
this thing i fell in love Oh Mon things
amazing it is a very pretty fun i love
the way it looks and i love the way it
feels the displays i guess a little
washed out i'm especially if
you use it next to something with an
AMOLED display you'll notice the colors
are not nearly as saturated but it's
still pretty gorgeous and if you use it
by itself and don't compare it to
everything else it's fine it's perfectly
lined the color reproduction is pretty
close accurate but it's more pale than a
lot of other phones displays yeah well
that was about it all right well thank
you for joining us do you have any final
questions for Tony or Stephen and myself
before you drop off not that uh that I
can think of so far okay be in another
live yeah next week maybe cool oh yeah
if you want it yeah if you want to tell
anybody where they can find you to
follow you on social media twitter
facebook google+ um well you can you can
find me on twitter it's x take 360 so
TIG 360 and also on google plus it's
Thiago sir area that's it awesome
alright well thank you for joining us
and we hope to see you in a future live
very soon thanks for having me thanks
sir have a great day bye let us let us
let me try to talk to you Sonny let me
unmute you and get your volumes back to
normal hey hey we can hear you loud over
here hi how are you where are you from
Oh am i'm from india from india well you
may actually you may remember you may
remember me from the episode 20 of the
season one another the jetta thingy
maybe roll achard i will tell you this
much i will not remember you not because
your face is not rememberable this
because i'm getting old and I have a lot
of episodes behind me oh man Kody like
in reality it's this clip I guess
Michael was also there you know maybe
did we'd be like a roll him he said that
camera thingy dad but I tried to talk i
start coughing so I was about to ask you
what do you want to ask us or what do
you want to talk about either CES
related or
completely unrelated to see yes actually
it's completely updated from CES um like
oh no there was like they saw when the
the topic which I want to talk to his
like about it's like a the phone box
video the phone blocks and the project
ara actually like when it just came up
like it was a huge explosion but then
finally like it fell down you know and
now like I I got us to tailor like you
know what anything related to our IM of
CES 2014 any like any glimpse of even an
e-book presentation for our or any
demonstration or something like that
none that i can remember no google had a
small corner of the show floor but i
don't remember any motorola presence
whatsoever no no no I mean yeah they
were pretty pretty silent and and
notable in and understandably so because
the Moto X is still relatively new what
four months five four months old and the
Moto G is new so they've already
released a bunch of stuff and they're
very they made it very clear that
they're going to vary keep their product
line very small so I didn't expect much
from them yes and project ara is
something that we're expecting to see
much more from way down the road like
2015 it's shall I go open standard it's
not just from the mood role not just
from Motorola it's like how many OEMs
will have to provide the service their
services for that not only motorola it's
like on in standard i what phonebloks is
working with them now but they weren't
at CES either so i think it's a very
much work in progress and and very very
early on there are very very high
chances that this will only remain a
proof of concept because you have to
gather older manufacturers to produce
older modules and then you have to get
into the mindset where I motorola or
Google or I phonebloks i'm doing a phone
which is completely against everything
else HTC Samsung
Apple and all the rest of the guys are
doing and I'm not sure how they would
welcome such a concept on the market
without just killing it at birth so I
think it's a great concept it's it's
like building your own pc or you're
building your own smartphone will it
ever become mainstream I don't think so
I'm less worried about the the
manufacturers there are no the ones
their feelings about this then tony is
and well I do think it's an incredible
idea I've been pushing it for this idea
of modular smartphones since i started
covering smart let's really i don't
think project ara is actually going to
happen in a way that we're going to be
satisfied with there are all these you
stumbling blocks the the way that
they're doing it this external
modularity snap together concept i think
is an awful idea from the get-go because
you're compromising structural integrity
you're wasting a lot of space with the
packaging of all these components the
only way this is going to make sense and
it's not very consumer friendly but is
something similar to a pc or a notebook
where you have even more delicate
components cards that you know fit into
slots inside but they be smaller the
whole thing would then be in closing is
one RF shield vs. separate shields for
everything and besides you know the that
issue the FCC certification must be a
nightmare for this because you're going
to have to get every single component
separately getting it certification and
it's a great idea I wouldn't make I did
about seeing it would be personally I
would view that it is even but remote
very yeah there's a German company back
in 2010 that tried to do it and they
failed miserably they had a website and
they were selling phones customers at
customized phone so you could pick and
choose what you want it on your phone
and it failed within three months so
it's a very very difficult thing to
overcome and I think the biggest thing
is it is part of what Tony said other
manufacturers because Eve even motorola
or another company that's in on this it
kind of reduces reciprocal sales because
if you can just constantly and
perpetually upgrade your phone without
buying another phone the only way that I
can make as much money as they made
before is to upgrade the platform not
just upgrade the components so require
you know some sort of different base
model with new modules but I just don't
understand how that would benefit anyone
I understand it's a cool concept but in
a in the grand scheme it's not an
execution not an execution you know how
I would I would see this working maybe
maybe in the future the way moto maker
is currently working helping you
customize the look of your phone what if
the next Moto X or more why or whatever
its name will be will use moto maker
version 2 which will not only allow you
to choose the outside colors but it will
also allow you to choose either knee
Snapdragon 800 processor or the 400
processor or 1 gig of ram or maybe 22
frame or maybe an 8 megapixel camera or
a 13 megapixel camera you're talking
about like divorcing the customizability
aspect from the upgradability aspect of
it you're looking like just me from the
factory locked in but at least give you
more control over the options exactly i
mean that's the entire idea behind moto
maker right your phone but why don't you
allow me to make my phone the way I want
it on the inside as well well there were
those rumors coming up to it i mean we
at the beginning with no idea what level
of customizations and i think there was
talk about at least ram options sounds
like that yeah hello i'm good i like the
first were designed by you the moto x
was like it was at rise like the first
one designed by you by google yeah take
that one step farther sure oh and the
second question like
my question was like for like her in
iphone like a after the iphone 4s when
iphone 5 came there was a bit of screen
pops I they were screen bomb from for
SEO 5 like to buy you steal off of my
particular used to apply to promote
developers to get their apps from the
screen size of iphone 4s to five so now
we're hearing rumors that the iphone 6
would be having a greater size and they
won't do it without increasing the
resolution so would it like should it
not be very tough Apple again to again
like promote the developers to build
their apps for the bigger screen the
bigger resolution oh there are two
things Apple can do and be smart about
it first of all if the larger so called
rumored iphone 6 will have a up to 6
inch screen they could keep the same
resolution and still get away with it
with a ppi rating up to 60 to 50
something or if they want to continue
going on with the retina marketing thing
they could just easily double the
resolution and that way developers would
basically have to just rewrite a small
portion of their code or the the iOS 7
point whatever it will be we'll just
like so double everything yeah if
developers have created their apps
properly and not just rasterized all the
graphics if it's just a matter of
changing the resolution of which it the
layout works jumping from the 4 s to the
5 all they had to do is add I think like
170 hundred and yeah they only had to
add a few vertical pixels but if they
jump to six inches I don't think they're
going to go the route of another iPad
Mini Fiasco where the display is just
horrible so they're going to have to
change resolution eventually in that and
that's probably the worst part of iOS is
is the way that the the interface is
developed and where android is
usually pretty much screen size and
resolution agnostic you can write one
layout and it worked for you yeah it
works for so many different screen sizes
and resolutions iOS is much less like
that and it creates some problems
developers but you have to understand
that and you have to be willing to
upgrade your apps if you want to
continue to make money so i think so i
think about this from sorry cut you off
taylor up from a developer versus user
standpoint i mean we can see reasons why
developers might be hesitant for Apple
to introducing the resolution like this
will be a little headache for them you
mean if they don't have to tweak their
code that much sure it'll be maybe a
little in the way but everyone's going
to do it because the iOS App Store is
still the place to sell your apps and
developers no hem in their Hall but they
will make those adjustments they will
make them quickly to the end-user the
impact should be minimal we're going to
see new apps refreshed straight away
you're like no apple is not accepting
the request for the iOS like the apps
which are compatible with iOS 7 like if
someone has to give an a it was a will
have to make it I always have
incompatible like with the look and feel
of iOS 7 otherwise Apple is just like
ejecting it then yeah yeah you do here
and bring it back with the look and feel
of iOS and with a Nokia Maps the gut I
pulled from the store didn't like it
didn't mesh well I would sound another
well that's someone's matter though yeah
but then I mean since they have such a
high resolution already for the ipad i
think meeting in the middle and creating
another resolution should be pretty
simple because they've already developed
applications which are at a much higher
resolution than probably anything that a
new iphone resolution what I think
blowjob discretize of the I time there
are smaller screen size of the ipad like
specially designed for 95 so Kingdom
known would be the reverse thing like
taking the opportunity for our iPad dude
I phones that were like which is not
possible yeah I think speaking I pass
the most important thing
for Apple going forward to the site
about resolution wise is the aspect
ratio difference between its tablets and
its phones that's ya gotta be more
annoying it seems to us from the outside
for developers especially you know those
making games things that are designed to
be full screen and not using so many
modular text boxes they can slide around
so easily I can see why Apple like
sticking with 4234 it's tabloids they've
had a lot of success with it but I could
have to wonder how sustainable that's
gonna be going forward it's such an odd
size and resolution know what is making
you having your windows cleaned I am I
just realized that imagine that okay
Sonny thank you very much for being here
and please do come back next week when
you have some more questions for us any
final thoughts early or like that my
camera not you because I see that you
have a Twitter account there you know
people where they can find you anywhere
a size from Twitter area you know every
real I mad at watch parted VOD sba rdan
like a fifth calm / wats part in the
google com g+ jour tu tío as last boat
party cool and i can I can't not laughs
I'm looking at Taylor right now and
there's somebody dominated let me lock
it on you for a second let's enjoy it
yes yeah i'm gonna guess down the line
I'm gonna have to music video on you do
I mean yes video bombing me I'm gonna
have to view whenever we go to someone
else because he's like banging on the
window right now so let's let's move to
a Stephen let's do cheese yum yeah okay
how about Lawrence I'm you're you're
Mike and say hi good morning guys hey
how's it going great there's my first
life that I've ever washes for the show
thanks watching and you're on it this is
the way to start your live hangout
experience it's very
really cool all right you know first off
I just want to say how much I love
watching you guys and reading the
updates in your videos actually stopped
following the verge completely um no
very much there's a slow clap from me to
you whoa slow clap I you know I
something about ces that I was really
excited about and continue to follow up
on is wearables I I think it's such an
exciting area of tech that is growing so
fast and I just want to hear what what
really excited you guys better tech
mobile started wearables aside from just
fitness trackers you know what kind of
wearables really caught your eye well
that's going to be a for me is going to
be a very short answer nothing because
let me explain we were very amped on
covering some new smart watches and
apparently most of the smart watches
which were on display at a special part
of i think it was central hole they were
either prototypes or non-working dummies
or things which we would really not like
to cover as in boy like things and I
really think that in terms of watches
babble aside there needs to be a company
depending on some people's opinions
Apple to really make a SmartWatch and
set the trend because of course Babel
was the first one and we're comparing
everything to pebble and now the Samsung
Galaxy gear is improved with its new
firmware but aside from these two
players on the market there's absolutely
nobody else bringing some innovation to
your wrist so if you ask me I'm amped
about the pebble steel I love the way it
looks it does not answer my needs
because I'm just a one second away from
taking my phone out of my pocket anytime
they lurk and can attest to that so it's
really no useful for me but maybe
somebody will go not saying Apple maybe
Sony will come with the SmartWatch 3 and
bring something which I will find
interesting
then I'm going to hand it over to guys
if there was a ninja story on the feeds
yesterday I didn't get a chance to cover
it but someone noticed they were going
around the sort of Southeast Asian
markets where one can find a lot of this
crappy knockoff electronic you phones
that look like an iPhone on the outside
but are running some skinned up
android/ios you something and they went
to all the stalls and they could find
all these knockoffs of electronics from
other manufacturers they couldn't find
anyone making a knockoff galaxy gear
okay and this was presented as some sort
of metric as a failed product so bad
nobody wants to even copy it as I
interestingly to evaluate how we're
really how the market is responding to
the this first wave of really
interesting wearables of yeah maybe
we're not ready for them I don't know
well I can definitely say that the
biggest takeaway from me from CES was
pebble steel I have an order one myself
and that's probably because I'm gonna
I'll review it they said they're going
to send us some review ins uh from some
review units either I or Michael we will
review it but i really liked go one hand
one who's reviewing it i win but uh it
just I don't know it doesn't need to be
improved all that much I'd like to see a
few more things on it but that's going
to be brought with the App Store so for
me pebble steel is you know a great step
forward for the company if you don't
count the editorial that I wrote and got
lambasted for over yesterday the one
about firmness for women yeah and you
know and it needed to be said because as
much as there are a lot of women out
there who were fine wearing pebble as it
is or even a pebble steel or galaxy gear
my mother would love a SmartWatch and
she will never wear one because it's not
fashionable and if there were one yeah
um and and I have ran into several women
who have asked me about it who've asked
you know what is that and why is it
giving you messages on your watch like
why is this and this is really cool why
is it so ugly or do they make one that's
a
prettier or you know in it in its it's
not just that men would like a smaller
SmartWatch 2 it's just there's nothing
out there specifically for women and I
wasn't trying to insult anyone it's just
something that that Michael and I have
talked about several times we heard that
Apple might be coming out with multiple
sizes for the iWatch yeah and that'd be
great i'd love to see just different
face sizes or different watchstrap lifts
like that's a very thick with four watch
strap for for someone with a small wrist
I have big wrists so it looks small but
outside of that so outside of pebble
steel that the risk zone risk revolution
or whatever it was that was at the very
best laughable there were a lot of
analog watches with very tiny displays
that would give you a note of my friends
yeah it's just an icon saying that you
got a text message that's what you have
to pull out of your pocket anyways did
everything work right so speaking to
what Tony said how pebble is not very
useful for him because his phone is you
know seconds away at any time when my
hands are full I just twist my wrist and
I can see what email just came in or you
know I can control my music from my
wrist with my phone across the room so
there are things that work for me really
well and the reason I don't go a day
without it but I think as far as what's
on the horizon pebble steel right now is
the best thing that's on the horizon but
i really look forward to what a lot of
the other companies who are rumored to
have smartwatches coming and Google
glass and all the other wearable
technology I look forward to seeing what
that really entails I wanted to happen
to those google smartwatch rumors well
yeah we will purchase twim' labs so the
whim one is actually technically at
google smartwatch now if you want to get
very technical but as far as a specific
google watch I figure it's coming if you
check whim labs their website it says
that they're working with a partner
right now and that all of their stuff is
confidential so I don't know I checked
that yesterday just just to see
but I personally am a watch collector so
I've got plenty of watches analog
watches that I wear on a daily basis so
I don't need another on risk display for
notifications one wearable that really
caught my eye uh doesn't have a display
at all it's called Kiwi move did you
guys check that out at all I've heard of
it but I can't remember what it is it's
uh it's loaded with sensors is about an
inch by managed by half an inch you can
wear it like a star commander badge you
gonna wear it on your wrist it takes
voice commands does gesture based
controls I think that's what really i
will take things ahead and that you
don't necessarily have to wear it on
your wrist you're not checking it for a
notification but you can control devices
by voice or gesture looking at it does
look interesting it was seeing on the
site here the sort of reminds me of that
that Sony was at the core yep it was a
wristband thing but he was a modular
actual sensor and it could I mean theory
be put on pendant or anything else that
you would wear under new it wasn't quite
this vocation as it didn't have gesture
recognition but I mean that idea of
sometimes less is more we don't
necessarily need all the feedback you
get from a something like the LG that
like and with the display and we don't
necessarily need that for a wearable
because we already have our phones on us
we can get feedback information as long
as they're all connected and talking to
each other yeah again all our then to
that's a huge benefit there are a ton of
those fitness trackers out there and I
have the Fitbit flex which I'm probably
going to take back I've quit wearing it
all together just because I just I sit
at a computer all day I don't need to
know I don't need something to remind me
that I'm not gonna have your sedentary
lifestyle yeah the misfit shine is very
similar to that one but it doesn't take
the voice control so I'm trying to find
the one that my roommate it's absolutely
going bonkers over and
it's one that uses some sort of light to
measure the caloric intake through your
blood and all this other stuff like I
don't know idea what it is but it sounds
cool and it's only like 160 bucks but I
don't remember the name of it so give me
a second I might be able to find that it
never rings a bell to someone using a
optical feedback in order to judge
caloric God that I was very skeptical of
that when I heard it but I mean you have
optical based blood oxygen meters so
knows maybe I'm being too quick to
dismiss that so one other question that
I have what is unrelated to CS but very
new in the news is Google's acquisition
of nest and and home automation I you
know between wearables and the future of
home on of automation you know it's a
joke that you know I should buy some
stock and sky in it yeah aren't you
worried that Google knows I mean so much
about you wearables it has your location
it has your physical stats and knows how
warm it is in your house when your when
your home when you're coming and going
it's it's a noise I swear yeah we're in
trouble that's true just much more like
this alright so I found it it's called
arrows a ir oh and it looks like every
it looks like the life band touch from
LG just flattened and a little wider but
it uses a spectrometer to measure your
caloric intake it tracks your food for
you just pretty cool also measured your
heart rate and a bunch of other things
supposedly says stay updated but you
cant buy it yet so that's all I've got
and I don't see a price 49 these guys
you may pre-order one for 149 before it
goes up to 199 as its final reef retail
price so yeah fitness tracker that reads
your caloric intake that that could be
interesting because that's probably my
biggest problem with Fitbit flex and the
force is that to be able to do anything
with it you have
input all of your calories and if you
don't have a structured measured diet
then you don't really know what your
caloric intake is you're just estimating
so yeah the big thing with fitness
trackers is or with any activity tracker
is you get so much information uh what
are you going to do about it you put it
in context ok so I slept crappy last
night or I didn't walk as much what am I
going to do with that information and
how its dedicated to that next step
right it's not like you don't know that
you did not sleep well i'm adding about
someone made these um smart Sox they
have emitted sensors on that can detect
your weight distribution and whatnot so
you shouldn't generate a lot of data
every step you take its measuring not
only like a manometer on a fitness
tracker that you're taking a step it's
mapping how your foot hit the pavement
how you you pushed off again and then
you know you load that onto your phone
sure you can in theory use information
to tell if you your strides wrong and
probably setting yourself up for some
sort of leg injury in the future but how
do you analyze that that's a lot of
information that go through and even if
you know that where do you how do you
implement the changes in your stride to
correct it then and without you know
apps getting a lot smarter about
processing this stuff all of the the
sensor data in the world is not going to
do us much good yeah I don't need a pair
of socks tell me that I overgrown eight
and yeah but I'm flat-footed my over
pronate like I don't need socks tell me
that yeah but if if this arrow could
work you know if it's right and it
actually does accurately read your
caloric intake that to me would sell me
like I would wear it I don't need a
wristband to tell me that I'm lazy and
that I said no that I got all day to
know exactly how many calories are
consuming every day well yeah that
zeroes on there yet that's kind of how I
lost a little weight last year I just
kind of started watching what I was
eating and keeping a very rough tally of
what I was eating in my head and you
know having something tell me exactly
what I was eating and how much I
and taking would be very helpful for me
and and to the fitness trackers they
were always for me kind of a an
inspiration to get up and actually move
but when you work very long days and to
waste much with your time and don't
actually have a priority of going to the
gym it's kind of hard to do anything
different about it so and on that on
that note I'm going to ask Laurence if
he has any final thoughts because we are
we're past the one-hour mark and I
really need my bills I know that that
was all I again great coverage of CES
knives to all the quick editing uh and
videos that were posted you know I was
watching a ton of those on chromecast
and once again great work guys thank you
very much I was sitting in a corner and
Anton was like whipping me while he was
shooting he was holding the hammer and
whipping there you can say that if you
say that once again people might believe
you duly noted a care Lawrence thank you
very much and be back next week I we
hope we didn't scare you too much with
your first appearance on the live show I
love it take care about and gentlemen
Taylor Stephen do you have any final
thoughts before we wrap this up um I
don't really okay that girl me crazy
with your car talked in Vegas and I
did the same with you too shall we we
are kind of on the same wavelength now
for a couple of weeks until we forget
about what we talked in Vegas but I have
not yet met Stephen in person and I have
not spoken to him since I left for Vegas
so Steven Lee I got it I'm not thinking
about that yeah I meh meh i'm a once but
you haven't crossed paths with you in
the state's what did you sound about
that maybe maybe you'll this summer when
i will probably be on the proper coast
on the coast which doesn't bring me the
viruses to bring home we have all sorts
of problems of our own hurricanes it
will find something to ruin your trip
and rednecks oh yeah at the end
speaking of that not rednecks not that
everyone who drives a Camaro is a
redneck but in America there are Camaros
everywhere this is what tony was going
crazy over in Las Vegas and I was trying
to explain to him that I could step out
my front door and throw a rock and
probably hit more Camaros than I have
fingers on my hand you know like it's
just they're everywhere I hate you I'm
probably sitting for rocks at Camaro
owners uh yeah but I was just gonna say
that since I've gotten back I've
probably seen like 80 thank you so it
mean it's just it's crazy i've been
paying attention to it now because you
were so crazy about him I'm sure sugar
next I'll see 1 i'll be in the US again
yeah we'll send me pictures of
Lamborghinis and Ferraris and i'll be
happy I will ooh and on that note ladies
and gentlemen well actually we were
supposed to have a lady but she did not
make it but hopefully she will next week
is when I talk nice use of the week off
button there well yeah without it using
the mute button went mute button on
others I love that yeah thank you very
much for watching I just lost my video
I'm not sure this can see me again thank
you for being part now Lulu thanks for
everybody for joining Thank You Taylor
thank you steven and hope to see you
guys next week in another formation
maybe with mr. Fisher and mr. I met
Rivera until then everybody have an
awesome awesome we can stay safe take
care bye bye see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
