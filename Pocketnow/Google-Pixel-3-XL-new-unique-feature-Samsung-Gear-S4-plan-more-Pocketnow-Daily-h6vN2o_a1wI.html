take the plunge to wireless charging and
other things with their new design of
the pixel 3 Apple apparently is not so
sure about this year's iPhones when it
comes to components and the Samsung gear
s 4 might not run where OS after all I'm
Jaime meadow Iveta I know this is
Saturday but you know me I can't leave
you guys without the news and I owe you
five dailies each week this is PocketNow
daily if I should lose today have to do
with deals if you are in the market for
any device the buy one get one free
deals from t-mobile
have just been ported to Verizon meaning
you can get the iPhone 10 or you can get
the pixel to for example buy one get one
free and this is all for Father's Day
it's gonna be Father's Day soon if
anybody wants to send me one thank you
and for those of you that were shouting
happy the fact that there were rumors of
a gear s for running on Android wear OS
apparently that's not gonna happen what
we hear is that apparently Google seated
some devices running the operating
system to Samsung executives for them to
give the operating system a try and
apparently that didn't go so well and I
it makes sense I mean the Tizen
ecosystem is not the largest but it's
large if you compare other wearables so
apparently that's not gonna happen
and speaking of smartwatches we've got
some trusted sources claiming that there
will be a SmartWatch from LG we were
expecting at at Google i/o there were
enough specifications to tell us that
something was going to be announced and
then no product was shown so when is it
gonna happen is the question probably
when the next V series smartphones get
launched but that will be later this
year at Aoife I'll see now let's move
the spotlight over to Apple as
apparently the company is not ordering
as many components for the next
generation iPhone as it did for this one
there's a ton of speculation over why
because it apparently the phones didn't
sell as much as the company predicted
I'm not gonna use that because obviously
analysts were wrong about that one I
just feel that the similarities between
the iPhone 10 on the iPhone 10 2018 are
gonna be so much that you don't need to
order as many components
apparently Apple will probably be
considering that some units will be left
behind whatever the case may be stay
tuned we'll keep you posted and finally
the most interesting news today have to
do with Android pee the Google picks
three and wireless charging bear in mind
google has been reluctant to adopt
wireless charging for the longest time
for reasons we don't understand and well
we hear that it's coming because of that
glass back but we also hear that that's
not the only thing apparently there's
going to be some new protocol within
Android P that they're coding dreamlike
and that will bring some sort of
different functionality to the wireless
charging that we currently see what will
this different functionality be it's
hard to tell but in today's question let
us know would it be cool for you to get
wireless charging on the pixel three in
my case it would so long as it's fast
wireless charging I hate that other OEMs
don't really adopt this pretty much only
Samsung but that would be me leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
