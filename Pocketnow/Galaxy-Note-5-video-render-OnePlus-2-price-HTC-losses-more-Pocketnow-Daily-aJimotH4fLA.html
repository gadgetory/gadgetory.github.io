will bring a hot new design 1 plus
finally makes the price points for the
one plus two sort of official nhcc takes
another financial hit this quarter I'm
high Meadow iveta and if somebody can
explain to me what happened to the
weekend they'll treat them to a beer
this is part out daily the official news
today are extremely sad as the drama
continues for HTC the company was back
in green and black numbers but things
are downhill the company started it's a
financial come back after it lost a
hundred million dollars in importer and
kept that streak for a while but now it
lost three hundred million dollars in a
quarter for reasons we don't really
understand let's see what the company
plans to do coming soon other official
news come for instagram users as those
of you that like the service like me you
can follow me at high memory that i have
instagram well you now have the benefit
that photos will not be cropped out and
destroyed at 640x480 pixels the company
will now support images up to 1080 x
1080 which is a great upgrade
particularly at times when most of us
are using 2k displays already so yeah
that updates should reach your devices
soon and give it all the speculation of
the price point of the 1+2 since some
outlets were saying that it was going to
cost more than five hundred dollars the
company CEO peter loud just came on
google+ to confirm that he will not
allow for price tag that's above four
hundred fifty dollars so yeah $149 could
be the price point for the oneplus 2
we're just a couple of weeks away from
that n even though we're expecting the
future Moto X to be announced any time
soon we've got some very interesting
leaks from the FCC as there is this
device going through certification right
now with a 5.5 inch phablet display and
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile LTE bands there was
another product similar to it for with
verizon bands so it could be that this
is the you know other device and it
could just be that motorola could
consider a Moto X and moto x plus scheme
let's just see if it does and finally
for the very interesting leaks of the
day famous tipster on leaks has just
showed us a video printer of the feature
galaxy
see note 5 and remember that project 02
and yada yada yada it seems that this
product will look pretty much like a
galaxy s6 only with a stylus silo so it
does seem that this product will not
retain the galaxy note design language
it seems that project zero does expand
but obviously that does leave us with a
major concern that it won't be
expandable which is what we talked about
last week so it does lead me to the
question of the day look at the leaked
video in the links down below and tell
us it you like that particular design
for the galaxy note 5 in my case I like
the design but again expandability is
everything for me leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video's
filmed make sure you follow us on
backing out comment subscribe to channel
as well it follow me on twitter hind
underscore iveta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am hi Natalie better thank you very much
