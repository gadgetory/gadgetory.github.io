pocketnow.com and in this video we're
excited to unbox the brand new HTC
Incredible S this phone was announced at
Mobile World Congress and - one of HTC's
newest phones let's get to it
ok so again this phone was announced
with the Wildfire s and the desire s at
Mobile World Congress and we're going to
unbox it here and take a look at what
HTC has done for their next generation
this has a new version of the Sense
interface which were curious to see how
that works
got some extra packaging here alright
and here is the box a new HTC box with
black instead of white kind of cool it
makes the device look really nice the
cool thing about the Incredible S among
other things is that these buttons are
sort of magical they will actually
rotate when you turn the screen to
landscape which is super cool can't wait
to get that up close and let's take a
look at some of the specs so we've got a
single core 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor the newest version
of HTC Sense 768 megabytes of RAM this
thing's going to be fast let's look at
the bands down here as you can see we've
got the aw s 1700 band and the 2100 band
so this should do t-mobile 3G which is
quite exciting so if you are on t-mobile
you're looking for a new phone this is
an unlock device it'll work for you this
may be a good choice for your next phone
eight megapixel camera with flash it
does HD video recording and then there
is a 1.3 megapixel camera up front
alright it looks like this sort of
slides down there's no tape to kind of
bring it down like so now this is the
successor to the HTC Incredible or the
Droid Incredible as it was known on
Verizon so we'll take this out and we're
not even going to look in here and
assume that everything is sort of the
same yep let's see if it even comes with
headphones kind of a darkish tint to the
plastic a minor detail but something
different so we do get headphones here
and we get the wall charger and things
like that pop this back in here and take
a look at the new Incredible S feels
very slender in handy got it
a really interesting contoured design
now the interesting thing about the
incredible s is the screen size it's 4
inches which is a really good size it's
not as big as the 4.3 inch display you
get on the Desire HD and the HD 2 but
it's definitely bigger than say the
Nexus 1 so here we've got a front-facing
camera and here's that contoured design
on the back with a dual LED flash those
of you with the Droid Incredible will
kind of recognize this little contoured
area let's turn it on if it even has the
battery and will pop off the back here
just to take a look at what is inside if
it'll come off that comes okay yep got
some plastic around the battery the
battery is of size fourteen hundred and
fifty mili amp hours pretty good size
there let's pop it back in and we'll
turn it on and while we turn it on we're
going to compare it to some other
devices so it's power button is upper
right a little bit different than some
other recent HTC devices it's going to
go on there it goes so here we are next
to the inspire 4G which is of course the
Desire HD much larger screen
I'd say the the Desire HD here is
thicker than the incredible s okay and
next to the Nexus S which also is a four
inch display we're running a super LCD
panel here and on the Nexus S you get a
Super AMOLED now so you're gonna get
better contrast with a Super AMOLED and
next to the touch diamond open up that
phones kind of old and next to the
captivate which also has a four inch
screen but the captivates thinness
cannot be beat we're gonna let it boot
up here for a second and we're gonna
take a look at the version of Android
that it's running looks like it's are
you ready it's got fastboot up so here
we go
HTC it's gonna take a minute we'll be
back alright first time set up trying to
find North American English but can't
find it that's strange insert sim card
skip and skip the keyboard transfer data
skip skip skip next or internet
connection
automatically sync data Wi-Fi networks
leave me alone let's go to the home
screen so
can take a look at settings so well
finish that and we'll get into the home
screen here it's loading the widgets so
we've got the sense widgets they added a
few widgets in / last version of sense
that you saw on the desire hd so here we
go let's check out this program tray
that they've changed okay
doesn't look change to me that's right
the newer version of the program tray is
going to come forth in the gingerbread
update so if we go to settings we're
probably that was a bedding guide say
that this is running Froyo so if we go
down to a bat phone we are running see
software information there it is Android
2.2 point 1 so you really don't get
those changes until HTC up grits the
Incredible S 2 Gingerbread 2.3 let's
take a look at these on-screen buttons
watch them whoa do you see that let's do
it again see so this button is pointing
left it's not pointing down when you
rotate it it actually rotates with the
phone pretty cool so a lot more coming
up on the HTC Incredible S if you want
one of your own right now they're
shipping that Negri electronics that
come it's unlocked it's relatively
expensive as is the case with unlocked
phones but you probably know that if
you're even considering an unlocked
phone they're about six hundred and
forty bucks over over at Negri
electronics calm if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and we'll be
back with a lot more on the HTC
Incredible S that's for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
