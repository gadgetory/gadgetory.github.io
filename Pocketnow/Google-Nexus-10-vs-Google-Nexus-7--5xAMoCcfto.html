hardware of the Nexus 10 and compared it
to the Nexus 7 and the motorola xoom now
we want to take a little bit of a deeper
look between the sibling rivalry between
the brothers neck see just how does the
brand new Nexus 10 stack up to its older
little brother the Nexus 7 let's go take
a look let's start out by looking at
build differences the nexus 7 as you
might have guessed by its name is a
7-inch tablet it's four point seven two
inches wide 7.81 inches tall and 0.41
inches thick and it's designed to be
held in portrait orientation the Nexus
10 on the other hand is 10.3 9 inches
wide six point nine nine inches tall and
only 0.35 inches thick it's designed to
be held in landscape orientation the
nexus 7 weighs in at just under 12
ounces whereas the larger Nexus 10 packs
on quite a bit of weight coming in at 21
point 27 ounces both tablets are built
extremely well though many have
complained about the cheap plastic feel
of the plastic on the back of the nexus
7 the Nexus 10 has a stripe of the same
kind of stipple plastic running across
the top but the rest is made out of an
amazingly grippy plastic it's going to
help you keep a good grip on it both
tablets feel solid and well-built
neither device has removable storage nor
removable batteries but the Nexus 10
resurrects the rear facing camera
something that's missing on the Nexus 7
let's take a look at the display
adorning the front of the Nexus 10 is a
beautiful 10.0 5-inch display running it
2560 by 1600 with a pixel density of 300
PPI the Nexus 7 has a 7-inch display
which runs at 1280 by 800 with a pixel
density of around 216 PPI many have
complained about the color saturation
and sharpness on the Nexus 7 to those
who feel this way
buy a nexus 10 the screen is gorgeous
let's talk benchmarks and performance
powering the Nexus 10 is a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core Exynos 5 processor compared to
a 1.2 quad-core Tegra 3 inside the Nexus
7 these two tablets are proof that more
cores don't always equate to faster
performance though we are comparing
androids to oranges due to different
speeds and processor architecture what
we couldn't say apples here could we
anyway how do they perform let's take a
look at the benchmarks quadrant on the
nexus 7 scores 3583 on the Nexus 10 4193
and 22 on the nexus 7 scores 10,000 473
whereas the Nexus 10 comes in slower at
88 17 this we suspect is because of the
lack of quad-core on the Nexus 10
showing that more course may be better
in some benchmarks moving along smart
bench 2012 on the nexus 7 scores 36 and
93 whereas the Nexus 10 scores 3285
moving over to the web browser for a
moment in the Sun spider benchmark where
lower is better the nexus 7 performed at
1680 point zero milliseconds the Nexus
10 13 58.7 over in geekbench to which
might be argued as a more up-to-date and
better representative benchmark the
nexus 7 got 14 38 or as the nexus 10 got
2454 if you'd like to see a hardware
comparison of how the Nexus 10 stacks up
against the Nexus 7 and the motorola
xoom so we mentioned earlier we've got a
video to handle just that if you haven't
started listening to our podcast yet
make sure you tune in every week we
talked gadgetry we talk tech and we just

out because it's really entertaining and
we hope a little bit informant
speaking of missing out you don't want
to so make sure that you subscribe to us
over on Twitter our official tweet
