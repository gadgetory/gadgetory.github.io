compete with the iPhone 10 but without
the knotch
the revamped LG v 30 will reportedly be
smarter than the current one and if you
thought Google pixels sold like hotcakes
think again I'm hi Marietta and dude I
know I'm gonna butcher your name but D -
your girlfriend wishes you a happy
birthday and happy Valentine's Day to
everybody this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for the Galaxy Note
8 and there are a ton of reasons why you
should it is currently available with a
ton of discounts depending on your
carrier but there are a couple of
catches depending on vigo verizon or
t-mobile you can get up to $500 off but
there are trade ins and other options I
would highly recommend you look in the
link in the description we will report
more on the Galaxy Note 8 very soon now
let's talk about pretty much my favorite
phone of last year the Google pixel to
excel for those of you wondering exactly
how many of these phones were sold it
seems that not much I mean you hear that
iPhones sell in tens of millions but the
pixel apparently only sold 3.9 million
units obviously the IDC is not really
official information this is speculation
given you know analytics etc but yeah it
seems that the pixel didn't really sell
well chimed in the comments why do you
think that is now let's talk about ZT
we've been waiting for the refresh of
the exon 7 and we hear that it won't be
called exon 8 because of how its name is
translated in Chinese it seems that the
name might be
axon 9 I assume and we've got some
leaked renders that show us a phone
that's got dual vertical cameras and no
stereo speakers to be found and this is
something that really worries us as one
of the coolest things about the axon 7
were the stereo speakers so let's see
exactly what we get now let's talk about
the next generation LG v 30 because
we're apparently getting a revamp a time
WC we are waiting for presentations or
whatever LG is going to do we hear that
the changes are going to be mainly
software oriented and probably some spec
bumps but most interesting is that the
company has come official with this new
visual AI that they're going to offer
for photographs meaning pretty much
everything that you're currently able to
do with the huawei mate 10 Pro pretty
much that's what you're going to be
doing with the lgb 30 at least
soon we can't wait to tell you more when
we get to MWC and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
Samsung the Galaxy S 9 and it's features
we've heard specs we've seen leaked
renders we've seen everything but we've
been waiting for the typical this is the
way we're gonna compete with Apple
thingy and apparently it's going to be
an emoji
it seems that Samsung is working on its
own version of 3d emoji which I assume
is not going to be like the current an
emoji that you probably be able to do
the same thing but with existing emoji
and by the way Samsung your emojis are
kind of ugly
uh-huh and hard to understand and
sometimes they don't send the same thing
like you're trying to send one emoji but
then the user on the other end it
doesn't have a Samsung phone doesn't get
the same thing point being is in today's
question do you even care about an emoji
or emoji or whatever cuz you know my
case it's cool to send information about
the way you feel with you know images
but I don't think it's worth even
investing on this thing I don't use that
emoji and it was nice at the beginning
but people just don't care about it
anymore leave us a comment down below we
