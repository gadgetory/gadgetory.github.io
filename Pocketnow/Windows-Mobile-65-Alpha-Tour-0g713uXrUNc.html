pocket now calm and we're excited to
show you a tour of windows mobile 6.5 or
at least the beta of windows mobile 6.5
that comes from XDA developers this beta
has some of the features but not all of
the features that will be out in windows
mobile 6.5 when devices start shipping
with it later this year I don't
recommend that you try this on your
device because it's still a little
unsteady and it doesn't work completely
and if you don't get the rom update
right you may break your device so let
me take you through this here the home
screen as we've seen many times before
comes right from windows mobile standard
which is the non-touch screen of windows
mobile so we have this kind of sliding
panel that jumps around on the screen a
similar concept here although it's
slightly different what happens is that
there is a there's a little window in
the center and it doesn't move and so
when you slide your finger along the
screen what you're actually doing is
moving the background so if we slide the
background down two messages we can see
we have no new messages we can go to the
time and swipe our finger to the side
although nothing happens there we can go
to voicemail and favorites it'll launch
pocket internet explorer 6 mobile we can
see our next appointment we can add a
new appointment by tapping in you know
stuff that you would find on Windows
Mobile standard home screen okay so that
is the they're still calling it to
today's screen by the way they may
change that later on the bottom bar and
top bar are transparent which is really
cool because you get to see more of the
wallpaper in the background and it's
likely that windows mobile 6.5 will ship
which with a pretty nice wallpaper as
we're seeing Windows 7 and Windows Vista
compared to windows XP at a lot nicer
wallpaper okay so let's go into the
start menu and of course the Start menu
doesn't exist anymore you press the
start button and you're taken right to
the honeycomb now you may be wondering
why did Microsoft decide to go with this
scrollable honeycomb interface well as
Adam Lane described on pocket now the
honeycomb shape or the I guess that
would be a hexagon shape provides a lot
of surface area making for very easy
finger
friendly operation compared to the
iphone and I'm not knocking the iphone
but it's kind of an improvement over the
square iconic interface on the on
windows mobile 6.5 and I like the
honeycomb I agree that it makes it very
finger friendly so what we can do is
scroll through the honeycomb and the
scrolling is a little slow right now
because this is a beta but you can kind
of get the point that it would be really
easy to find a program in this list now
what you can do you can move a program
to the top of the honeycomb if you use
it a lot like file explorer you tap and
hold and you click move to top and it
jumps and because this is a beta it
doesn't always work let's try it with
calculator move to top I didn't work
here but you get the point so we can go
into other parts of this of the menu if
we go into settings settings is no
longer a separate screen it's really
part of the honeycomb it's just another
section of the honeycomb and what we can
do is we can scroll through all of our
settings we can actually bring one of
these items to the main honeycomb so I
just clicked add to favorites so now if
I close out and I go back in we see
Communication Manager added to the
favorite part of the honeycomb interface
so the honeycomb is customizable you can
move things around which is good you can
put your top most use programs right on
the top so that you don't have to scroll
down to the bottom let me show you
something else about windows mobile 6.5
I'm going to go into file explorer and
here's something that you can notice
right away is that the highlighting is
kind of 3d not that big of a deal of
course but I think it's a nice visual
touch also there's a new physics engine
that allows for a really good flick
scrolling at least improved upon from
previous versions of Windows Mobile and
so and we also get the little Vista
spinning spinning waiting cursor so we
can go to the top and flick scrolling
works quite well you can stop it with
your finger flip faster and of course
the scroll bars on the side are faster
now so you can easily grab them with
your finger and slide that around also
all of these soft de menus have been
over
halt so if we press menu we kind of get
this hovering menu pop-up and what we
can do is we can click the down arrow to
get to the other entries or we can
actually flick our finger up and kind of
carousel through all of the options and
it's really easy to just choose any
option here from the soft key menus now
that they're a lot bigger on the screen
and of course the X button in the upper
right corner is a lot bigger to making
it more apparent that to get out of this
screen you press the X button up there
and you're taken back to the main screen
and of course windows mobile 6.5 has a
new lock screen although this lock
screen is still the beta it's not
actually what we're going to find on the
final shipping version the shipping
version will have a lock button here and
then you can actually slide downward and
see if you have a new any new calls new
messages new emails and then you can
slide the respective slider to the right
and it will take you directly to the SMS
application or the email application
depending on whether you have new
messages so a great way to save some
time but this beta just has a simple
little slide to the right block a
mechanism up at the top so that's pretty
much it for the windows mobile 6.5 beta
like I said this has some of the
features but not all of the features of
the upcoming windows mobile 6.5 of
release and of course to keep abreast of
the latest windows mobile 6.5 news keep
