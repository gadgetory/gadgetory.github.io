he want Johnny no my god that's probably
the most informative comment of the week
where are the beer jokes I miss them and
you don't look like somebody that should
be missing that's right it's that time
of the week I am high never leave it up
this is pocket now and this is the
pocket out daily recap for last week so
on Monday asks you the oldest SmartWatch
which one and why as the news were that
a lot of surveys confirm that ten
percent of iphone users are willing to
buy the Apple watch we have 987 comments
out of which face says I cannot handle
the hassle of charging one more gadget
and smart watches are for people who
just want to show off no real use just
the gimmick for now but let's wait for
the future what holds and you have a
very interesting point here definitely a
lot of people that own a SmartWatch will
own them because they're cool because
they are the new thing but not
necessarily because they're useful and
that's my biggest complaint about
SmartWatch is the fact that they're just
an extension of a phone more like an
accessory than anything else and Jade
says if a SmartWatch can function
independently then there's nothing smart
about it good point best comment of the
week thank you and Santiago says smart
watches are like small versions to
smartphones which are uncomfortable
expensive it might save you 10 seconds
of a day totally useless you know most
of the comments of this video in
particular we're negative against
smartwatches and that could give you a
scope of why they haven't sold as much
as they should and on Tuesday ask you
what do you think about all these patent
disputes between smartphone makers as
the news were that the Chinese company
is going to sue apple because they feel
that the iphone 6 was a copy of their
design even though i don't think they've
seen the ipod touch 5th generation we
have 653 comments out of which
cottleville opus says everyone copies at
some point Samsung copied the iphone
inspects a little design so now its
bones are somewhat popular true it
depends really the biggest problem is
that smart phones lately have become so
basic in their design so basic so
simplistic that how can you say you're
not really copying if it's just the
slate if it's just so simple that
everything just looks like it and John
says sue sue sue sue shoes a name
now it's not in the comments by the way
but shoot them all day long let crap
will feel off of other companies felt
true Apple is number one it's suing
others sometimes it's good for them to
get a taste of their own medicine mr
Swan says every single phone now looks
exactly the same so I don't care anymore
it's amazing how phones looked so wild
and different five years ago but all
that turns into an unsurprising piece of
slab like we see today now we even call
a company creative and revolutionary
when they release a phone with five
color options dude probably the best
comment of the week as well we've had
some really good comments this weekend
this is probably the best ones that's
the biggest problem you know bones are
really just slaps today how can you not
have a phone look like another if
they're all slabs what happened to the
glory days of slide-out QWERTY keyboards
and different other options like well no
I'm not going to talk about the back
flap on Wednesday ask you which is your
favorite iOS or android keyboard as the
news worth and swifty was so smart it
could even help professor Stephen
Hawking you know with his disability
issues we have 597 comments out of which
dark black 22 says what C and SwiftKey
both loan are awesome even though I am
more into flexi I have heard a lot of
comments today about flexi I'm actually
going to give it a try indeed the notice
show says I always go back to swiftkey
it's my daily keyboard like sometimes I
force myself to switchfoot now can't you
know that is exactly my problem I've
loved swifty ever since the first time I
tried it mainly because I speak in two
languages and I don't like to be
swapping keyboards every single time and
as much as I've tried to move away from
swiftkey it ends up being my favorite
keyboard for reasons that are just
particular to me Tommy says right now I
prefer using the stock keyboard on my
iPhone because it always works swiftkey
on iOS is great but it lacks sometimes
and you know you have a point the iOS
keyboard is really really good it used
to be my favorite before swiftkey the
problem is that again the language
switching and everything is annoying and
swifty came to the iphone and but yeah i
agree third-party keyboards on iOS right
now are terrible but on Thursday I asked
you do you like big phones or
smartphones and why the news where that
Apple is building a 4-inch iphone 4 2015
which is interesting that they're going
back to that we have 1236 comments
thanks a lot guys out of which other out
of those says I think one-handed uses
more important having a big phone can
get annoying at times I just don't care
about big bones and that is your taste i
know a lot of people that feel otherwise
but true one-handed usability is
important in my case i used to like the
iphone mainly because i have to carry
two phone so it was great for one of
them to not be huge and paul says i
think when having usability is important
but i am generally using my phone
sitting down or in some resting
positions so most of the time i am using
two hands anyways I wouldn't ever buy
another 4 inch phone up true most people
like bones to consume content and yeah a
big display makes a big difference when
sore limbs says big phones for sure I
site discomfort is definitely more
serious than hand comfort or discomfort
should I say you make an amazing point
most of the people that I know that have
gone to big phones haven't really been
because of content consumption they want
bigger text and they want to see
everything but on that display and yeah
buying a bigger phone is a good option
only don't make it an iphone as Apple
actually doesn't handle big displays the
same way that Android this and finally
on Friday I asked you if the samsung
galaxy s6 is your next smartphone as the
rumors were that we already have specs
and benchmarks for the galaxy s6 which
should be slated for mwc 2015 we have
957 comments out of which henry says no
after using stock lollipop every skin
irritates me and I think that everybody
feels that way the biggest problem with
the samson is not really their phones I
don't feel they're ugly I just feel
their UI is data and Marco says nope
samsung equals same song every year
seriously I'm never going to buy another
samsung phone until they truly update
the design for their software and
hardware internals and specs are fine at
the very least um you know in my opinion
for example again I don't like their UI
but I do like their hardware I feel that
it feels good I used to love the note 3
and x like the note 4 so up it depends
really on taste when Russ says what do
you mean you're not a samsung fan I
vaguely remember you talking so highly
of the note for being released and how
you are going to
buy it Wow the only samsung phone that i
like is the note lineup and it ever
sends the galaxy note 3 mainly because
of the faux leather mainly because it's
really thin and because yeah there is
some added functionality with the big
display and having a phablet and again
owning a small iphone and the phablet
was cool it reminded me of the old
pocket pc days where you actually own
the dumb phone and the pocket pc pretty
much the same deal here um well not
necessarily i'm not calling the iphone a
dumb phone but you get the point that
I'm making and yeah I like the Galaxy
Note 4 I just uh I don't know it hasn't
really grown on me yet that's it for a
pocket out daily recap thank you very
much for watching a couple of tips if
you want your comments to be featured
