6 gets leaked in photos 18 d finally
launches the samsung galaxy s5 active
and more oil has sadly closed its Moto X
plant for moto maker I'm hi Mary Mehta
and if you are not celebrating friday
yet don't worry i can do that for you
this is parking out daily you know one
of the biggest questions we ask
ourselves is exactly how is Samson going
to differentiate the galaxy s5 active
from the current galaxy s5 and well they
kind of figured it out they just
launched it on AT&amp;amp;T and the difference
is that this is a more ruggedized galaxy
s5 it's actually a shockproof phone that
doesn't look like your big shoe it's
sexually looking quite sexy in its
design and it's got the advantage that
obviously it's pretty much a galaxy s5
and that's literally everything it's
actually got better and close respects
to the galaxy s5 than it previously did
with this for so links on scripture for
full details it will cost you two
hundred dollars after a two-year
contract now we've got some good and bad
news from HTC on the positive side there
is a wearable from the company it's
called the HTC One wear and yeah I don't
know where but where is where and yeah
it's gonna be called the one where and
it'll be using Android wear and
apparently it'll happen in q3 but the
bad news is that apparently the company
is ditching the project that the HTC One
m8 prime for undisclosed reasons
obviously this was still a rumor so sad
news don't know why now even though
we're not expecting WWDC next week to be
launching an iphone there is a more
credible back panel of the 4.7 inch
iphone that just got leaked and this one
actually has two cutouts for the cameras
and everything it actually looks real it
looks good but interesting there is a
cutout for the apple logo where in the
past that's never actually have a cutout
that was only exclusive to the previous
ipad lineup so we wonder exactly how
Apple plans to use that hopefully bring
tennis or something stay tuned as a this
actually does look good now one thing we
were expecting to see at WWDC and that
will apparently not happen is let's
screen multitasking on the iPad
apparently that's what's going to be a
feature for iOS 8 apparently it was
going to be launched at WWDC but rumors
have it that Apple doesn't have this
ready
this is really sad news and we're
expecting it it was part of the rumors
that we talked about a couple of weeks
ago so let's see what we get on Monday
probably will not be as bad as we think
and finally for the very sad news of the
day motor oil has just made it official
that they're closing down there
motomaker plant in the United States
moto maker will continue working only
from plants in China and Brazil and the
reason why this is sad news is because
obviously these are US jobs that are
being lost it's happening all over the
world but sadly it's happening in the
u.s. more often than none and it's
really sad because even though this is
not part of the local deal apparently
Motorola was still going to do this
because the Moto X was not a success
that leaves you see the question of the
day what do you think about this would
this make you buy a smartphone more if
you knew that the labor was coming from
the United States because in my
particular case I'll tell you this much
I know countries like for example
Colombia and Mexico which they really
like to consume their own products and
they try to look for products that are
made in their own countries to support
their industries and you know I wish
this were the case in the United States
but apparently it isn't and the Moto X
was a really really great bone so would
this give you a change in heart in the
future whenever you buy a product
because in my particular case it would
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video was filming she follow
us on parking i'll comment subscribe to
our youtube channel as well it also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscored
iveta please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi meri
behna thank you very much for watching
we will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
