guy weekly is coming to you a day later
than it normally would the reason for
that was a family emergency now I'm not
going to tell you all the details about
what happened but I would like to share
some things that I learned about how
technology can help what I wish I would
have done to be more prepared my
android-powered smartphone let's go take
a look so we're going to talk about two
kinds of emergencies to prepare for one
that involves you where you can't answer
for yourself the other one that involves
someone else where you are there
answering medically relevant questions
for them and would be a good idea if you
had a bunch of information so you can
answer those questions accurately so in
the first scenario let's say you've been
in a car crash your unconscious first
responders are on scene they know who
you are because they have checked your
driver's license but they don't know who
to contact and they don't know if you
have any allergies or anything they
should be aware of what do they do well
there's your smartphone they pull it out
they look at it they might not have an
Android they might use an iPhone they
might have you know an old feature phone
or Windows Phone they've got to open up
your phone find your contacts app I hope
it's somewhere close find your eye CEE
in case of emergency contact that
hopefully you've put in there and then
make call now that that's an awful lot
of assumptions and honestly they can
figure it out my four-year-old can
figure out any smartphone out there so
they can figure it out it's just going
to take time time that they could spend
giving attention to you or treating you
in a manner that was more consistent
with what you needed for example they
might not know that you're allergic to
penicillin until they find that person
call them get a response back that
you're allergic to penicillin not not a
good situation there's another problem
with that in addition to the difficulty
in finding it with all the different
ecosystems of phones out there today
I've got a lock screen on my phone
unless they know my code they can't even
get into my contacts to find my in case
of emergency
do you have a lock screen and did you
consider that if you do or even if you
haven't here's what I'd recommend on
android-powered devices and this i'm
showing you with ice cream sandwich on
your lock screen you can go in and set
up owner information it's under security
and you can put in your owner
information now it doesn't have to be
owner information it can be anything you
want it can be the Declaration of
Independence I don't think you have
enough characters for that but it can be
anything in this case i put in a
person's name their relation to me a
phone number where they can be contacted
and a list of my allergies now this
wasn't specific to me this was just for
an example but you can see where I'm
going with that without even having to
know how to use my phone they turn it on
they see my lock screen they know all
that information right there no problem
your phone probably has something
similar but that you can use to help
speed up the process of knowing about
any allergies or any medical conditions
they should know about and contacting
someone who can't speak for you while
you're incapacitated so there's that
part the next part and this is what
happened to us we had a family member
who's an older gentleman and he had a
nickel emergency in the middle of the
night and we were in the emergency room
all day long all day long he's okay and
stable now but it was a little bit scary
what it was good that we had was my wife
had her android-powered phone it was a
Galaxy Nexus with her and when the
nurses were asking what medications does
he take well in this case this
particular individual because of some
health history in the past takes
literally dozens yeah over 30
medications that they need to know about
before they start putting an IV drip
with medication and whatnot into him
they need to know if anything is going
to counteract or interact adversely with
what this individual is taking well
luckily my mother-in-law had a piece of
paper in her purse that had this
information on it but it was several
months out of date and inaccurate my
wife on the other hand
an up to date list on her phone see
she's the one that keeps this list and
she sends a copy over and my
mother-in-law printed out puts it in her
purse well in this case she had an old
copy in her purse but mine my wife had
this up-to-date copy on her phone she
was able to pull her phone out she had
it stored in an email not a good idea
and I'll get to why and she was able to
say no no no if that's wrong this this
this this this this many milligrams has
been times today worked out great he
also has had a significant medical
history heart problems and what not
defibrillators been implanted in his
chest he's got multiple stints
gastrointestinal issues doctors need to
know this before they start treating you
know if his heart work to stop then and
they were to put paddles on him that
would be bad if they didn't know about
his defibrillator that was implanted we
kind of be doing two things it's doing
the job they're doing the job problems
so she has a list of all of his major
medical procedures operations and
complications that he's had in the past
going back for decades again in an email
not a problem but it's better than
nothing it it was there it was readily
available she could read it back to the
nurse and her split it into the computer
everything was fine he was happy some
complications were potentially avoided
but what if this would have happened out
in the middle of nowhere where data
coverage was very very spotty or
non-existent she can't get to the cloud
to get this document to get this email
whether that's Google Docs whether
that's Dropbox whether that's just
storing it in gmail and doing a search
even if you have very slow but you still
have data connection it's just very slow
doing a search and finding that email is
going to take a long time that might be
time you don't have save this as a PDF
or as a some other kind of text document
local to the device so you can refer to
it whenever with or without data
coverage okay so that's my software tips
for you hardware tips she was on the
phone all day calling relatives
contacting people contacting doctors
yada yada yada she has an extended
battery for her Galaxy Nexus
luckily she did when I got there she was
down to twelve percent if she hadn't had
that extended battery she would have
been dead but the phone would have been
dead probably a poor choice of words in
this context but I was able to get there
with a charger so one extended battery a
good investment if your phone will allow
it second carry a charger with you guys
if you carry a bag put it in your bag if
not put it in your car ladies if you
carry a purse put it in your purse if
not put it in your car someplace where
you've got a spare charger so you can
plug in when needed okay last topic a
lot of hospitals say no cell phones
allowed you know what that's fine
airplane mode just go into airplane mode
tip there you go I'm on airplane mode
life signal is an interfering with your
equipment so I'm just here reading off
this as if it's an e-book at this point
most administrators are going to be just
fine with that then when you need to
make and receive phone calls you can
step outside exit airplane mode and make
those phone calls get those emails send
those texts anything that you need right
there ok so I apologize for having the
episode out at daylight couldn't be
avoided in this case and I learned an
awful lot from it and hopefully you
learned something from my experience so
you'll be better prepared in the
unfortunate event that this might happen
to you or someone that you know and love
again I hope not but if you're prepared
it'll be much better experience for you
and hopefully it will turn out better
than it would otherwise kind of a somber
episode today I apologize for that if
you have other tips in this type of
situation please let us know in the
comments again this episode is all about
you guys the conversation starts with
you so keep it up let us know in the
comments if you like hearing this kind
of information please give the video a
