CyanogenMod 9 one of my favorite custom
roms out there and I hinted it something
that was interesting and that was coming
that what's that
it's an NFC sticker so what we're going
to talk about today is NFC which is
either going to be really dull and put
you to sleep or it's going to blow your
mind I'm Joe Levi this is PocketNow
let's go take a look so NFC Near Field
Communication essentially what it is is
a little microchip with a really big
antenna relatively speaking all kind of
connected together and with the two you
can connect you can communicate over
very short distances how short well
essentially you have to touch these to
the back of the phone because the other
antenna the receiving end or
transmitting depending on what you're
doing with it is inside the battery kind
of interesting but what can you do with
it well in our last video I showed you a
really cool feature of CyanogenMod 9 now
again I'm running CyanogenMod 9 this is
a couple days newer of a nightly on this
phone but it is a Samsung Galaxy Nexus
the GSM model but this will work with
any phone that has an NFC chip and a cm9
ROM running on it don't worry if you're
not running a cm9 ROM on your phone and
still want to do it we'll have a part 2
video that shows you some other cool
stuff you can do with NFC coming up but
back to cm9 we talked about profiles now
just to recap really quickly profiles
are things that you can set up in cm9
that will let you set certain things on
or off based on where you are not
necessarily where you are but based on
your profile and I just happen to name
them based on where I am it's kind of a
difference there the first way implies
that there's some kind of geolocation
going on there's not back to this I've
got a profile so
for my car that does certain car things
like we talked about turns on Bluetooth
turns off Wi-Fi some other things at
home
turns off Bluetooth turns on Wi-Fi turns
off GPS all this cool kind of stuff
night well night mode is really cool
because I have it set to make my phone
shut up it won't wake me up at 2:00 a.m.
when I get an email or at 2:15 when I
get another email it's happened it's
annoying this fixes it I have to get
into these different modes how do I do
that well I can always come in here do
this do that and say okay hey look night
mode whoo I'm in the night profile now
great now that takes way too long
so let's say I just woke up I can do
this press and hold my power button up
here and now I can change my profile to
home and say oh woops home and then say
okay still too many taps I don't want to
do it so what can I do
check this out we're going to go back
into settings back into profiles and
let's say night okay this is what I'm
doing at night but I don't want to have
to manually change the profile AHA and a
tap on that guy right there
so it's writing a profile to an NFC tag
allows you to tap the tag to select that
profile tapping a second time will
select the previously selected profile
so there's my tag here's my phone just
like that tag successfully written this
is now programmed to be my night time
tag got it okay
so I've got this folded so you can tell
that it's night time we're going to come
over here to home now I'm sorry did we
just do home I think we just did home
let's uh let's go to work say I'm at
work now so here I am at work let's
program this tag to be my work tag
Tagg successfully written there you go
work okay so that's it
what do I do with it well these are
stickers this sticky back right there
now when I want to change profiles I do
that and it's now set to night mode it's
automatically set all of my rules when I
scan this again it will reset it so in
this case I had night and night so it's
just so I had night and home so now I'm
back to home mode let's pretend that I
went to work and take that and now my
profile is work okay
come home it's late at night I want to
go sleep there you go now I'm back at
night mode and you're seeing my profile
switching down there on the bottom now
that's kind of cool but these are ticket
just stickers I don't want to you know
carry them around in my wallet with me
what I want to do is put them in
interesting places Hey so what I've done
is on my nightstand where I charge my
phone I have my charger get that over
here and what I'm going to do is just
plug this in great now I've got a spot
on my nightstand where let's pretend
we've stuck this down I come home I set
that down and I'm done except it
selected work because what was already
in night mode sometimes demos don't do
exactly what you want them to do because
they're not all that easy to keep track
of where you are cuz you're in the same
place but now I'm in night mode fabulous
great when I get up in the morning and I
go someplace you know the power bi knows
let's say I want to take my smartphone
with me well I can put a sticker on the
door that will automatically when I tap
it change me over to home mode I'm going
to take this very sticker with me to
work today I'm going to put it someplace
inconspicuous and when I get there I'm
going to switch over to
work just as easy as that I've got
another one of these stickers already
set up in my car very inconspicuous I
want to get to my car I just have to
hold my phone over the sticker and I'm
automatically changed into car mode very
cool I like this a lot
completely blows my mind and I hope it
blows yours again cm9 custom mod
profiles if you don't have those you're
in luck there are some other stuff we're
going to talk about that in our next
video in the meantime if you want to
find out more information about NFC cm9

about here head over to pocketnow.com
