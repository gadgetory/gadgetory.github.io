comm and today i'ma she would unofficial
semi official windows mobile 6.5 ROM for
the samsung omnia 2 so I'm actually
gonna let this boot up and you'll notice
that there are not any signatures for
ROM developers on this so there's no
like made by so and so so as you can see
just the basic Windows 6.5 screen right
here or just let it load it actually
loads pretty fast so it shouldn't take
too long
probably so we'll just let it load here
so the first thing we have is actually
of course the samsung proprietary
TouchWiz will let it finish initiating
does take a little bit of time
unfortunately ok so as you can see we
can just flip through these through
these three screens here so I can just
go to another screen and to another and
we've course can add all these other
widgets on this device just close that
the phone looks the same so the phone
pad is exactly the same as the six point
one wrong and the phone book is exactly
the same as well so we're just going to
go up to the start and as you can see
it's very fluid it's not like some other
windows mobile 6.5 wrongs that we've
seen on devices all of the applications
work so when I when I launch this
program the actually actually the
marketplace worked the my phone worked
games it does have some pretty cool
games in here we have this crayon
physics and asphalt 4 which is a it
works surprisingly with the
accelerometer on this device so one
thing that's changed on this ROM opposed
to the windows mobile 6.1 ROM is that
the Samsung omnia 2 was a little lacking
in the text messaging it wouldn't thread
the text messages but luckily this new
ROM is actually fixed that substant
going to hear something I just sent so
as you can see it actually threads all
the messages together so
it's a great feature to have of course
on any device and it has been classic on
the 6.1 windows mobile 6.1 for over a
year now or so so and all of the same
touch TouchWiz programs work on this
we're on as well so I can just flick
through and as you can see if I hit this
little center gem here can click through
this this other page that gives us more
programs you can also click to the cube
which launches with a different
background and it's still just as fluid
works very well have all the same
programs let's see here the radio still
works everything seems to work very well
so it leads me to believe that this is
actually an official or semi official
windows mobile 6.5 ROM for this device
so if I go to the media player which is
just the samsung omnia to proprietary
media player you just go to cancel and
as you can see let's see here we got a
video you play and it still works rather
well if I change the position of it as
you can see the video and clarity is
still just as excellent as it was before
with the 6.1 ROM so this is the Samsung
omnia 6.5 Windows Mobile ROM and I'll
post a link on pocketnow.com is how to
get this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
