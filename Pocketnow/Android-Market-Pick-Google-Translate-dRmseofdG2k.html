pocket now calm and in this android
market pic we're going to take a look at
google translate a free program from the
market that does an awesome job at
translating for you let's take a look
and this is a really great app if you're
traveling to a country where they don't
speak your native language so we can
open it here google translate and really
that its purpose is to work two ways you
could use it to determine what you
should say so you want to know where the
bathroom is you don't know how to say it
in Spanish you can get the application
to do it for you or you can use it as a
translation device if somebody's telling
you something you'd hit record it will
record it and spit out English or
whatever other language you want to
think that we can have this in a cell
phone in a free application is amazing
this is sort of science fiction like 20
years ago we would have imagined some
sort of device in our pocket you know in
in the year 2030 that would translate
what we're saying and now we have it as
a free app that just pretty amazing okay
so let's do where is the bathroom where
is the bathroom okay so I took a little
bit of Spanish in high school so I do
know that donde esta el bano is where is
the bathroom and if you want help in
saying it you can actually click the
little speaker here and it will speak up
so a little bit robotic but it works so
let's switch to another language let's
go two more and there are a lot of
languages so I'm going to change this to
Russian now we're going to go English to
Russian where is the bathroom and this I
guess it doesn't look like it will speak
it for you only for certain languages so
it doesn't have full support for every
language with some of the common
languages it should work quite well for
so let's change let's actually go
English to Russian what time is it
okay now it's working a little bit
better here and again it doesn't have
the the translation ready for you in the
robotic voice but you get the point so a
really fantastic application again it's
free from the google android market a
very good tool to have if you're
traveling around and you need help
speaking another language that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
