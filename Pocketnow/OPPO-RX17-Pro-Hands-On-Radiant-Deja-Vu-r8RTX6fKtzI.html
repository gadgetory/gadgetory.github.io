phone that might look a little bit
familiar but could not be more different
hey it's Joshua for Gaara what's going
on everybody and this is PocketNow
bringing you a first look at the Opel rx
17 pro now the rx 17 pro is basically
derived from the r17 Pro the naming
convention had to be a bit different for
Europe but this is essentially the r17
pro that you might have seen a little
while ago and based upon that phone you
might also be forgiven for thinking this
phone looks a lot like the oneplus 60 it
has the same teardrop knob the same
level of screen to body ratio on the
front but once you turn the phone's
around it couldn't be any more different
the version that I'm using right now is
this gradient called the radiant mist
and there's a bit of an s-curve to it
that goes from purple to this bluish hue
and it's a really eye-catching device
obviously it's going to be one of those
phones that is very fashionable even if
it looks a little bit too flashy to some
people all credit goes to Opel for using
a gradient that is from left to right
rather than from top to bottom like we
have seen from many different devices
up until now also it's all about the
small details with this design at the
top and bottom there's a bit of a
crescent that goes into the device that
way it's not just a rounded edge that
might dig into your finger if you're
balancing it on your pinky you'll find
that there's a triple camera up top but
another small detail that has been added
to the RX 17 Pro is that it has a dual
aperture you can actually see it moving
right now depending on what mode you're
going for as the camera is going to
detect what best setting to use for the
scene it is looking at but let's head
back to that front where you see that
little teardrop at the top and that
houses a twenty five megapixel
front-facing camera and allows for all
of this screen to be available up front
that screen is a six point four inch
AMOLED display coming in at full HD plus
resolution and covered in Gorilla Glass
6 underneath that surface you get a
snapdragon 710 with the audrina 616 for
graphics and then you can get different
SKUs for 6 gigabytes 8 gigabytes of RAM
and then all versions have 128 gigabytes
of on-board storage
the battery is 3700 milliamp hours in
capacity but you can charge it up really
quick using the super vooc charging this
is one of oboes claims to fame when it
comes to fast charging they call it
super vooc flash charge
and you are able to fill the battery up
to 40% in about 10 minutes
thanks to up to 50 watts worth of
charging another small detail you'll
notice on this phone is that there's no
fingerprint reader on the back on the
front in any home button instead it is
that hidden fingerprint sensor
underneath the display and of course if
you're not going to use the fingerprint
sensor there is a face on lock which is
really quick you can even set it up so
that you can just lift the phone it will
turn on the screen look for your face
and get you right into the operating
system and kind of bringing this all
together is color OS now updated to
version 5.2 and it's based on Android
8.1 there's still no app drawer here by
default you have to swipe among all the
different home screens and if you go all
the way to the left there's a shelf like
screen that is called the smart
assistant where you can put some widgets
and some extra bits of information to
make it easier for access you'll also
notice that I'm using different gestures
on here the Oppo RX 17 pro is actually
one of the most adjuster heavy devices
that I've seen recently in that you can
customize just how the gestures work you
can have these little bars on the bottom
that give you the ability to swipe up
from the middle to go to home or hold it
there for the recent apps screen or you
can swipe up on the different sides on
left or right to go backward or you can
customize which swipe takes you backward
or which one takes you to the recent
apps screen or just have a simple swipe
that always brings you back to home or
to your recent apps now as is usually
the question with full screen gestures
the Google assistant is nestled in the
power button this time you can actually
set it up so that you can hold it and
that will be what triggers Google
assistant there are even some
considerations when it comes to games
there's something called the game space
which allows you to customize not only
the performance of each game that is
collected inside of here but also to
block certain notifications or to just
not be disturbed at all I like the idea
that you can block just the banner
notification so you're still going to
get vibrations and sounds coming into
the device but you're not going to have
your game occluded by a banner that
comes down from the top but now we can
talk about the camera array well start
with the front-facing shooter a twenty
five megapixel F 2.0 aperture shooter
that allows for not only high quality
selfies but also a lot of beautification
modes and AR stickers now let's talk
beauty modes first what you can do is
get straight into the Beauty modes when
looking through the front-facing camera
in or
to change different things like the
shape of your face how slim your face is
what kind of jawline you have and you
can basically make yourself look very
different from who you really are every
time I use a beauty mode like this it
makes me hate myself
there are also AI Beauty modes that will
just pick the levels for you if you just
have that option on one thing that's
interesting about the front-facing
camera especially for video is that you
can apply the beauty mode while
recording now not really while recording
I have to change it by changing clip so
there's your grade 6 Beauty this is at
max the AI Beauty is already taking away
a lot of my freckles everything is a lot
more soft and also it's a little bit
more overexposed that's generally what
the beauty mode ends up doing in photos
and in video it makes everything a lot
brighter obviously I'm not really the
biggest fan of the beauty modes but if I
had to keep them on just keep them
around levels one or two and then
something that I feel like we should see
more in u.s. devices these stickers
these are all really fun little graphics
that you can put on top of your already
existing beauty mode let's say selfie
you can always turn off the beauty mode
and then have the stickers on as well
but there are a ton of really fun
animations that are here if you want to
add to that selfie or to that short
video that you want to send to any of
your friends in the US this is something
that we would typically see built into
the snapchat camera or even the
Instagram stories cameras but this is
something that's built into the camera
app of the rx-7 teen pro and now we can
get to the rear cameras the big addition
there is one that I'll get to in a
second mainly because it's actually not
available for usage adjust yet but the
main shooters are a 12 megapixel and 20
megapixel combination where the 12
megapixel shooter has an F 1.5 or F 2.4
smart aperture dual aperture function as
I showed you earlier it is able to
change its aperture much like in the
samsung galaxy s 9 so that it can flood
in more light if it's a low-light scene
or make the photos even sharper if you
have a very bright scene there lot of
different modes on here including an
expert mode that allows you to change up
the settings also portrait modes where
you can take portraits of other people
and add lighting effects to them even
after the fact you just have to go into
the gallery press the button in order to
change the different effects and select
from the myriad that are available but
the focus here is on
Photography and a night mode is
available now that allows for long
exposures when needed of darker scenes
the smart aperture is already doing what
it can to flood in enough light but if
there has to be a longer exposure that's
where Oppo added in the three axis Oh is
and that allows for up to three to four
seconds worth of exposure to be done in
one shot and even if you're holding the
phone in place then you don't have to
worry too much about your jitters
actually making a blurry picture and
that final large sensor at the top is
what they call a tof camera a
time-of-flight camera now this is
supposed to provide some apparatus for
3d scanning now unfortunately the
ability to do so is not available yet on
the unit that I'm using it's still
coming in an OTA update so being able to
make 3d scans of something by basically
walking around it with the camera
pointed at your object that's something
that I can't really show right now but
what the TF camera is also able to do is
help along with the night mode shooting
as the announcement of the rx 17 Pro in
Europe is being done right now obviously
the unit that I'm using is
pre-production so once I get my hands on
a full review unit I'll do some 3d
scanning but what I really want to do is
make sure I do a lot of those night
shots to see how they turn out
you can look forward to more of that
coverage not only here but also on my
own channel and so there you have it a
look at a new phone coming out in Europe
Oh buh-zard line finally comes to a
brand new market and it's kind of doing
so with a splash it may not have the
absolute best specifications across the
board but there are a lot of
considerations in the RX 17 pro those
small details that do make it stand out
from the rest whether it be the design
the camera 3d scanning even as it comes
in a future OTA update and even those
stickers that are available if you want
to have some extra fun with your selfies
there's a lot to like in the RX 17 pearl
and we're looking forward to getting our
hands on a final review unit so keep it
tuned to pocket now for that review and
for all of the coverage on oboes brand
new device and you can look forward to
even more from us all here and also at
my own channel youtube.com slash joshua
of regard so you can see all of the
different perspectives on all of this
tech as we continue on I'll see you on
the next video and remember to enjoy
your tea everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
