now calm and this is a look at flipper
which is a new program from mobile
source software they are the makers of G
scroll mobile remote and some other
smallish utilities for windows mobile
that are inexpensive but pretty useful
and innovative so this latest one called
flipper places a tab across the right
side of your screen at all times
although you could have it on auto hide
and when it does is it gives you access
to some pieces of information whatever
screen you're in so if I tap on the
green tab I will get the weather for my
area if I tap on the black tab I'll get
a list of people that I want to call on
a regular basis this is configurable so
I can have multiple pictures here people
that I call often if I go to the red tab
this is just a task manager programs
that I've opened right now and to get
back into a program you can tap on that
particular icon or you can terminate it
down here with these soft keys the
button below here the kind of teal
button is a quick launch tab that I've
configured with these three programs
programs that i use on a regular basis
and down here on the bottom is the time
and the date in very large huge letters
for those of you that don't like to have
the time up here this may be a good way
to sort of organize it in this area now
you may be wondering doesn't it cover up
things on the screen to have this
overlay on at all times and it does
actually but in most cases it doesn't
really matter because it covers up the
scroll bar in most programs and because
there's kinetic scrolling and windows
mobile now and in previous windows
mobile devices you really don't need
access to the scroll bar as much as used
to before when there wasn't kinetic
scrolling so let's go through some of
the settings for this program so we're
going to flipper and flipper settings we
can turn on animations and I'll show you
what those look like I have that turned
off because slows things down a little
bit you can have it kind of peel out
like that let's go back into the
settings we can have it on auto hide so
that it doesn't show up on the screen
unless you assign a hardware button to
it and i'll show you how that works so
it goes off the screen and what i want
to bring it up quickly I tap on a
hardware button that I have assigned to
it and here it is it comes up right on
the screen let's see what else we have
we can have the tab be on the right side
of the screen or on the left side I
think it makes more sense on the right
because of the scroll bar issue we just
talked about you can change the tab size
and over to the right this
is where you can figure all of the
different tabs so if you tap on quick
lunch and click options you can
determine what programs are in that
quick launch and you can change the
color of each tab so right now whether
it's kind of a dark green we can just
flick through and say let's make it a
kind of bright green and if you click
options on whether you can add your city
in their speed dialer will let you add
in people that you want to call task
manager not too many settings there a
quick launch we can just like that one
we can add our frequently used programs
datetime not many settings here you can
change the the time zone and that's
pretty much it and we can add additional
modules say if you want to have two
quick launchers or one whether for one
city maybe keep the tab at the top and
then put another tab at the bottom for
weather in your hometown for example and
of course you can move these around and
organize them sort of the way you want
so overall a pretty neat way to bring
forth things that you do on a regular
basis that you want to make a little bit
quicker the program is five dollars
which is pretty good price for a simple
utility like this we'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get it we've
heard from the developer that they're
going to be releasing an SDK so that you
can design your own flipper panels
perhaps you want one for your next
appointment or that integrates with
tasks or something like that there's
really a lot of possibilities so opposed
to link on how to get that that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
