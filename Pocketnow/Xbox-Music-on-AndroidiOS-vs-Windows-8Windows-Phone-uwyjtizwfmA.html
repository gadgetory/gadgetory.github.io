now calm and Microsoft just released two
new apps for the Xbox music service one
for Android and one for iOS in this
video we're gonna take a look at how
they work and how they compare to
Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 on a
tablet let's check it out first let's
look at the Android and iOS apps both of
these are practically identical to each
other you start off first you gotta log
in with your Microsoft ID and it has to
have an xbox music Pass subscription and
then it'll load all of your playlists
that are synced from the Xbox music
cloud collection so here's the playlist
section you can create a new one like so
with that plus button and over here we
both both of them have a little menu and
that's about it
there's playlist there's collection
there settings so collection is just
going to be artists albums songs and
genres this one doesn't swipe and then
there's settings and it's not very
comprehensive you can sign out you can
turn on or off cellular data so if you
don't want to use your data connection
you can just use Wi-Fi and you can
manually sync so the only other option
here is search
so here we can find just about anything
even if it is not in your cloud
collection and then you can drill down
and find the albums by that artists you
can sort by the songs and you can see it
by oh now on Windows Phone Xbox music is
completely different we actually have a
store where you can select music and it
loads and then you can either download
it to your device for offline listening
or you can purchase it as well so
there's a buy option there's Pentastar
there's an tonight plane and we also
have the smart DJ button which is great
for creating kind of Pandora style mixes
and on Windows Phone we also have
listings of new releases top songs top
albums as well as top mixtapes
these are custom playlists and here's
the music and videos hub which is kind
of part of Xbox music so we have our
collection and this is also loading the
cloud collection you can see down here
we can turn that on or off cloud
collection overall the Xbox music
support on Windows Phone 8 is just much
more comprehensive than on Android and
iOS now on your Windows 8 tablet there's
also an Xbox music app and again it's
completely different from Windows Phone
8 as well as Android and iOS so here we
see my collection most of these are in
the cloud you can sort them this way on
the PC in the cloud and you know artists
songs etc but we also have a radio
button and this is loading a smart DJ
playlist that I created either from the
Xbox or from Windows 8 so it remembers
the ones that I view
before and you can create a new one this
way I'd type in an artist there's also
an explorer section which is nice we
have new albums it's listing there and
you can choose to play it right away
there's also the download button and we
also have the buy album option or the
smart DJ start radio button let's do
explore artists and you can see what
albums I have in my collection as well
as other albums available and down here
we see our playlists these are all
synched from the cloud collection they
were created either in Windows Media
Player from a long time ago and then
imported into Windows 8 and we can
create a new playlist that way and of
course there's search
so you can still search for anything and
stream it or download it on Windows 8
and when you're listening to music you
can get this nice screensaver like view
of the music with some cool artwork so
there you have a quick comparison with
Xbox music on Android and iOS with
Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 tablets
obviously Microsoft's support for
Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 is a
little more advanced but at least now
you can use Xbox music on Android and
iOS devices as well that's it for now be
sure to give this video a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
