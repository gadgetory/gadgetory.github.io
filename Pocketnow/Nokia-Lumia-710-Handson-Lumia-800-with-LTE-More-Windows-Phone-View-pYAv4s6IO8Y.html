the Lumia 710 is not good testing at
lte-enabled lumia 800 for AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon and what's all this about the
famous SMS bug all this and more coming
up right now hello everyone I'm hi
metairie better with pocketnow.com and
welcome to Windows Phone you the show we
wrap up all this week's good and bad
inside the world of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform let's start this week off
with what's good well we were recently
invited to know can t mobile's launch
events of the Lumia 710 and well you
think the device is cheap because of the
design being different to the Lumia 800
or because it will cost you just 50
bucks so you think its low-end but sadly
hey no that's not the case the device is
actually really good it performs just as
well as any other Windows Phone and even
those specs are pretty much there I
don't think it's really got anything to
end me from other devices really good
now watch Adam lanes recent video on the
device and our hands on and well if
you're thinking about purchasing a
windows phone it'll be available as of
January 2012 now speaking of Nokia let's
go through this week's rumors first of
all Swisscom recently tweeted that
they're expecting to get a nokia lumia
900 terror as early as februari 2012
that doesn't sound like a typo because
they mention a date but we have really
no information on this device aside from
the fact that everybody's speculating
that it will be large and they'll
compete with devices like the HTC Titan
now hopefully that launch date also
includes the US though we don't see it
likely other recent rumors have no kit
testing and lte-enabled variant of the
Lumia 800 to work on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
now interesting enough do we see that
hold water sadly we don't remember that
Microsoft's intention for windows phone
7 Apollo or 8 or whatever they're going
to call it this for windows phone is an
operating system to support LTE though
remember the fact that Microsoft has
been doing weird things that it wouldn't
do for anybody else just for nokia so it
could be that we're wrong and we will
get an LT enable to nokia lumia 800 for
other carriers microsoft has just
launched a new app for SkyDrive for both
windows phone 7 and iOS the app allows
you to access the files
them in the cloud for SkyDrive in a very
finger friendly you I now it's sexually
great solution for those of you that are
carrying either an ipad or an ipod touch
and also windows phone seven sins
Dropbox doesn't work in Windows Phone
currently base not officially and well
hit the link in the description for
Adams recent article about and even
videos to see how it works because a hey
it's free what's not to like about it
out of this week's coverage machine
catch Adam lanes recent xbox live game
reviews which include doodle god which
is this really cool puzzle that allows
you to combine elements to create others
and even human life can you believe that
kind of cool Adam later brings us a full
demo of breeze which is another really
cool game and finally you have battle
wagon which as the name tells you is a
battle wagon game that's really cool for
those of you that are out fighting and
bonds and stuff like that kind of cool
just hit the link in the description for
you to watch these games which are kind
of all compelling that does it for the
good let's continue on with what's bad
Microsoft's SMS but for windows phone
seems to only go away view hard reset
the device and hurt hard were set in a
long time and well remember that news
where there's this string that somebody
can send you as a text message and
actually lock you out of the whole
messaging hub well sadly microsoft
hasn't figured out a fix it seems to be
not only sticking Windows Phone
apparently it also hits other platforms
though when those phones been the only
one prominent actually right now because
it's a closed ecosystem and well
Microsoft has an issue to fix so your
only option is to restore your device to
factory settings which would be a
hardware set so sad news for that
because we were expecting some sort of a
heart software update or something to
fix that and hey if you got your hopes
up last week about NFC on current
windows phone devices sadly the news is
that no it's not currently available on
Windows Phone devices that are currently
shipped Microsoft is came on record to
tell everybody that well they are
expecting it to come from future devices
but not for current devices so sad news
for that because well NFC is not really
the future yet it will be later like I
said it's the future but sadly it's not
the case right now so i guess microsoft
is just holding their coins until they
get it right
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm hime every
veteran give us a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
