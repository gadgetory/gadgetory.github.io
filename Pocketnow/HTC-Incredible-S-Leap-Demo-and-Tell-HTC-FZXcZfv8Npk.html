and we're taking a look at two features
where basically it's one feature and one
at
new HTC Sense this button right down
here it will launch your programs
the new feature which we are going to
talk about is the leap let me just do a
brain
to get them to believe
so far so good but once you are in lead
tactic and holding on one screen allows
you to rearrange the screens with
incense so if we want to save our
typical at home and put it at the end
there you go now let's take this one
which is people and take it up front so
you can play around with the screen
customize it according to to your needs
once you hit the back button there's
your new order
and another thing which is he's going to
find it inside settings
it's tell HTC tell a Chia
HTC's way up 14 errors so it's something
else than ever reporting you can enable
it for example it you have your network
preference to send air or when they are
connection is available or send it when
Wi-Fi or cable connection is available
references see also medical center
reports or sqh time
this appears whenever a application
widgets sense itself crashes then the
error report says ultimately to HTC so
this was a Tony from pocketnow.com
taking a look
new features to HTC Sense from the HTC
incredible as hideaway this is valid
also for the Wildfire s and the desire
as three devices which are running the
latest version of HTC Sense thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
