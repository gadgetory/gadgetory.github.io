and Windows Phone you better know what
the best of each has to offer on the
Android side the jury's still out on the
Samsung Galaxy s4 but we do have the
device that's going to beat it to market
in our studio today the brand new HTC
One and even though it's five months old
at this point we still consider the
Nokia Lumia 920 the king of windows
phones so let's put them head-to-head
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is HTC One versus Nokia Lumia 920
we've already reviewed the international
version of the HTC One and compared it
to the HTC Droid DNA and Apple's iPhone
5 and we've posted some exhaustive
camera comparisons at pocket now as well
to see those and to make sure you don't
miss anything else HTC One related
follow us on social media and subscribe
here on YouTube in this comparison we're
going to be covering build quality specs
UI the camera and a few test notes in
terms of build quality these phones
almost couldn't be more different we've
always given the Lumia 920 a bit of
flack for its extra punch at ten point
seven millimeters it's a little thick
and at 185 grams it's heavier than most
any modern smartphone out there by
contrast the HTC One is a sliver of a
device at 9.3 millimeters in the center
narrowing to even slimmer dimensions on
the sides and despite its all-metal
construction it weighs in at just 143
grams that metal is aluminum by the way
broken up by injected polycarbonate on
the backside and machined drilled holes
for the front firing speakers above and
below the Gorilla Glass protected
display the Lumia 920 also packs
polycarbonate a lot more of it because
its entire body is cast in the sturdy
stuff glossy or matte finish the Nokia
phone can take a pounding as we
demonstrated in our Lumia 920 durability
report that helps make up for its added
heft as does its pure view camera which
we'll get to later in terms of the
design nokia employs many more curves in
the Lumia than HTC does in the one from
the Nokia Smile to the rounded sides to
the displays Gorilla Glass which almost
looks ready to spill over its edges
there's also the total lack of flare on
the Lumias backside
is completely blank with the exception
of the camera cut out these foams are
the product of two very different design
approaches but there's a lot to like in
each whether you prefer the added
convenience of a hardware camera key on
the Lumia or the IR blaster on the one
there are nuances and touches that
captivate in the build of both of these
devices that's true in the specs as well
and that's especially visible in terms
of the display there's no real contest
here the one is packing a powerhouse of
a screen shoehorning a 1080p s LCD three
display into a 4.7 inch footprint
resulting in a ridiculous 468 pixels per
inch that's astounding pixel density for
a smartphone screen many would call it
overkill and indeed you do have to
squint to even try to make out pixels by
comparison the 4.5 inch IPS LCD on the
Lumia 920 is only 1280 by 768 producing
a pixel density of only 332 PPI yes
those are huge quotation marks we're
putting around these onlys the 920 s
display is still perfectly suitable for
most users and it's gorgeous in its own
right producing colors that are a tad
warmer than on the one and very readable
and daylight where the Lumia suffers by
comparison is inside visibility and of
course the difference in resolution is
highlighted by Windows Phones larger
rendering of text and icons you'll have
to get your own eyes on each of these
screens to decide for yourself which you
prefer the ones display is amazing one
of the best we've ever seen but the
Lumias is still nothing to sneeze at
under the hood there are significant
differences in CPU and memory a
dual-core Snapdragon s4 at 1.5 gigahertz
on the Lumia and a quad-core Snapdragon
600 at 1.7 gigahertz on the one there's
also one gig of ram on the Lumia to the
two gigs of ram on the one and for
storage both of our units here pack 32
gigs but the one is also available in a
64 gig variant the Lumia is not neither
device offers additional expansion by
way of memory card so you have to make
do with what's on board and the
batteries on each are also sealed in
2000 milliamp hours on the Lumia and
2300 milliamp hours on the one charging
them is a different procedure to both
devices include micro you
SB ports but the Lumia offers Qi based
wireless charging as well the HTC One
does not but it counters for that
deficiency on the connectivity side
adding 802 point 11 AC to the Lumias
more typical a b/g/n Wi-Fi support we've
been through the differences between
Android jellybean and Windows Phone 8
quite enough at this point but the
salient comparison here is between Sense
5 and Windows Phone it's pretty easy to
draw comparisons between HTC blinkfeed
and Windows Phones modern UI concepts
and to be sure they include similar
elements in terms of square blocks
containing images and text but that's
really as far as the comparison goes
Microsoft's modern UI is minimalism
taken to the extreme and it pervades the
OS blinkfeed with its image centric
approach and erratic tile sizes is much
more akin to Flipboard and it's confined
to a small section of the phone you can
choose not to use blinkfeed by sticking
to the more conventional Android
experience most of the time then while
HTC has really changed the flavor of
jelly bean in some significant ways the
comparison ultimately comes right back
down to Windows Phone versus Android a
Spartan stock experience or a busier
customizable one the question of which
you prefer remains philosophical other
considerations like fluidity aren't as
big a deal anymore because the HTC One
has the power to keep the experience lag
free while the Lumia features an OS
famously optimized for smoothness app
launch and resume times tend to be a
little quicker on the HTC One so if
you're a real speed demon you'll want to
think about that also Android offers
some old favorites like text wrapping in
the stock browser and of course if you
don't like that you can download a new
browser very easily but once again we've
fallen into the platform question the
question you should have answered before
choosing devices the bottom line is that
each of these devices runs its
particular platform with extreme
alacrity as mentioned before we put
these cameras head-to-head in a previous
feature at PocketNow which contained
many side by side examples and which we
encourage you to check out since then
though the HTC One has received a
notable update to its camera software so
we decided to briefly put it to the test
against the 920 once more results were
similar in our brief rematch with both
cameras delivering very good performance
and standard lighting conditions with
default settings the one delivered much
warmer tones than the Lumia 920 overall
an HD sees aggressive exposure
adjustment remains in evidence when
tapping to focus on the viewfinder both
units had trouble with brightly lit
subjects and darker surroundings
but each also excelled in more balanced
low-light situations
the Lumia still produces more authentic
shots on the whole but either of these
smartphone cameras certainly does well
enough overall for day-to-day social
media photos and even the occasional
high profile landscape or portrait the
front-facing camera is another story
Nokia's front-facing camera resolution
might not lag too far behind the ones 2
megapixel shooter but it's much narrower
field of view and the dusty lens problem
reported by many lumia owners on forums
across the internet make the 920 s FFC a
real dud compared to the ones those
holes above and below the HTC ones
display aren't just for show boom sound
might be a somewhat tacky brand name but
it's accurate in terms of media playback
the ones sound quality absolutely
destroys the Lumia 920's let's be clear
the 920 speaker isn't bad necessarily
it's a tad on the quiet side but it's
about average for a smart phone HTC's
boomsound blows it away because it's so
far above average it's incredible
bass is deep the sound is rich and it's
loud after a few minutes of this you
wonder how you ever managed to listen to
your media on another device the ones
audio superiority doesn't stop at
playback phone calls are also much
better than on Vilonia on both sides our
one provided fuller less tinny sound in
the earpiece with fewer compression
artifacts in a quiet room callers said
we also sounded much better and clearer
on the one than on the Lumia some of
that might be due the network
differences between AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint but
based on our own and other reviews we
have to give most of the credit to the
one here
HTC's Sense voice is much more than just
a brand name we have more observations
on the Sprint version of the HTC One
including battery endurance and
benchmarks and more detailed notes in
our full review at pocket now the one
certainly has a lot going
for it but it hasn't left its Windows
Phone competitor too far behind in terms
of sheer performance both of these
devices run smoothly and deliver a bevy
of features in a robust beautifully
designed casing you'll be a winner
either way you go here
the only question is whether you prefer
Microsoft or Google as your mobile
platform provider of choice plenty more
coming on the HTC One and other devices
so stay tuned to pocket now in the
meantime throw us a like if you liked
the video drop us a comment if you have
something to say and thank you for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
