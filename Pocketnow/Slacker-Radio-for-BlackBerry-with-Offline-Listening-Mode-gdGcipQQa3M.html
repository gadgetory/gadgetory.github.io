blackberry these are all cached stations
right now the blackberry is an airplane
mode all of the radio antennas are all
these are all personal stations that you
can listen to interact with without any
sort connections so you could be on a
plane or on the subway or you're not
even need incurring any sort of cellular
or data charges even while you're
listening you can skip songs you can
part songs advanced songs or even
artists and when that reconnects the
cloud it's going to take all your
preferences and convey those so maybe
you go into work and log into your slap
their account on a Mac or PC on a web
browser all of your stations all your
preferences follow you around slacker
radio has a music library that's about
four times larger than the leading
competitor we see here as you're
listening if you want to learn about an
artist say you're listening to a Tom
Petty track you want to learn about him
you can click here and then you can read
a biography of the artist and read an
album review written by AMG and you can
also get song lyrics and this is all on
flying right now too this is all offline
that's right
slacker radio you can either create your
Station beta based on one artist you
like or 100 artists you going where you
can listen to over 100 genre base
stations and all of ours honors face
stations are programmed by djs all
across the US in their experts into
respective genre for instance there's a
god market commons the programs are 90s
alt-rock station he was the god that
that DJ in seattle we broke bands like
Nirvana and soundgarden would you be
able to walk us through how the caching
process works or how you would do that
on the device short thing look at that
get Patrick to show you that okay so
well simply need to get basically go do
you can do a couple of different
locations actually let me show you
online because since we're offline all I
can see on the stations that have
already saved up to my done to my
blackberry but if I want to be able to
catch some stations let me actually do
that from another phone is that okay
yeah it's worth so here I've got a
slacker slacker running on a blackberry
bold and if you go to our main station
is like an amazing browse as I'm just
mentioned any of our june twenty or so
DJ stations and then i can do is i can
go to any one of these stations and then
market i can race it either the option
buttons a patch station right here
and it's gonna then told me that I how
many stages about cash how much space
I've but I have left and its own flag
that station to be saved next time i
refresh my station ok so now alternate
will be saved next time I i refresh my
device so i can do it there if i'm
listening to a station the same listen
to our NHS are in control station from
the menu option all i can all have to do
is hit option menu I say cash station
again it's going to tell you how many
stations you have cash how much space
you have so you have labs and I can mark
that one with your cash so now I've
marked to news stations to be cashing my
device and then what I can do now is
either if I with tethered or connected
to my pc via USB or connected to Wi-Fi
or even over the air I can basically
just click on that and say refresh my
cash stations and what's going to do now
is start refreshing my impression might
buy my stations ok so I want to refresh
process i'll say yes I do and so now
it's going to start refreshing my
stations over the air in this example
because I don't have a Wi-Fi connection
I back into my pc it's going to start to
refresh if you have a few minutes in a
hot spot or want to be able to do this
on the road you certainly can thank you
