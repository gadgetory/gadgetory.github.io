blackberry these are all cash stations
right now the BlackBerry is an airplane
mode all of the radio antennas are all
these are all personal stations that you
can listen to interact with without any
strip connections so you could be on a
plane or on the subway or you're not
even incurring any sort of cellular or
data charges even while you're listening
you can skip songs you can part songs
advanced songs or even artists and when
the app reconnects the cloud it's going
to take all your preferences and convey
those so maybe you go into work and you
log into your slap their account on a
Mac or PC on a web browser all of your
stations all your preferences follow you
around Slacker Radio has a music library
that's about 4 times larger than the
leading competitor we see here as you're
listening you want to learn about an
artist say you're you're listening to a
Tom Petty track you want to learn about
him you click here and then you can read
a biography of the artist and read an
album review written by AMG and you can
also get song lyrics and this is all
online this is all off line that's right
I will slack the radio you can either
create your station beta based on one
artist you like or 100 artists you like
where you can listen to over 100 johner
base stations and all of our genre space
stations are programmed by DJs all
across the US and they're experts in
their respective genre for instance
there's a god Marco Collins the poor
grooms are 90s all rock station he was
the guy that that DJ in Seattle we broke
bands like Nirvana Soundgarden would you
be able to walk us through how the
caching process works or how you would
do that on the device short thing that
you get Patrick to shrink that okay so
well simply basically go dude you can do
a couple of different locations actually
let me show you online because since
we're offline all I can see on the
stations that have already saved on
someone to my blackberry but if I want
to be able to catch some stations let me
actually do that from another phone is
that okay yeah so here I've got a
slacker slacker running on a blackberry
bold and if you go to our main station
this I can they see brows as Andrews
mentioned any of our June 20 or so
DJ stations and then I can do is I can
go to any one of these days you know
and then market that I can race it
either the option button say patch
station right here and it's gonna then
tell me that I've got how many changes
about cash how much space I have left
and it's on the flag that station to be
saved next time i refresh my stations
okay so now I'll turn will be saved next
to my device so I can do it there if I'm
listening to a station listen listen to
our NHS are in control station from the
menu option all I can all have to do is
hit option menu I can say cash station
again it's gonna tell you how many
stations you have cash how much space
you have what you have left and I can
mark that one for cash so now I've
marked two new stations to be cashed in
my device and then what I can do now is
either if I have a tethered or connected
to my PC via USB or connected to Wi-Fi
or even over-the-air I can basically
just click on that and say refresh my
cache stations and what's going to do
now is start refreshing my impression
might buy my stations okay so I want to
refresh process all say yes I do and so
now it's going to start refreshing my
stations over-the-air in this example
because I don't have a Wi-Fi connection
I don't I can to my PC it's gonna start
to refresh if you have a few minutes in
a hot spot or want to be able to do this
on the road and certainly Canada thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
