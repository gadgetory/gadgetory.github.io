pocketnow.com you know a lot of people
really like touchflo 3d it's a fantastic
way to kind of
pictures and your your weather and get
to your internet favorites and that sort
of thing but it's only available on the
touch diamond and touch pro right now
and there have been other attempts to
bring touchflo 3d to other windows
mobile devices for example there's
throttle launcher and I showed you this
in a video recently so it does an okay
job it doesn't look quite like the
original touchflo 3d that you have on
the touch diamond and touch bro but but
it's okay but fortunately the guys over
at XDA developers have found a way to
extract touchflo 2d as they're calling
it from the upcoming HTC touch 3g and
the result is a program that will work
on any windows mobile HTC touch screen
device such as the titan to this is the
titan to right here it'll work on the
HTC touch it'll work on the the original
titan and a lot of other devices and it
looks really good so you can slide your
finger along the bottom and this is kind
of a weird perspective and it looks just
like the touchflo 3d interface there are
some changes there's actually some
additions and some subtractions so we
have the Home tab which has this
fantastic clock here we have the people
tab which instead of you know if you
remember touchflo 3d you could flick
through your favorite people with this
it's more of a tile-based interface we
can still see our messages here we can
flick through them I don't have any
messages there we can go over to our
mail messages and we can flick through
them like in touch flo 3d but it's not
kind of tilted in a three-dimensional
way but that's ok over to the internet
pain we have our internet favorites but
this is actually broken it doesn't work
and this is probably because the the the
upcoming HTC devices wall of opera and
there's no opera included on this device
over in the Photos tab we can still
flick through our pictures although it's
not as 3d like as touchflo 3d obviously
I mean this device doesn't have a
dedicated GPU if we go over to music it
kind of works the same way it will
search for music on your device and I
don't have any music on my device right
now if we go to weather unfortunately
weather doesn't work yet and this is one
of the areas that it's broken and just
to be sure
it wasn't just this device I tested it
on the you know the touch over here so
it's not just this device and if we go
over to the right we have something new
and it's called map search which I'm
assuming we'll link a search from from
touchflo 2d to Google Maps this to
doesn't work for some reason so that's
about it for touchflo 2d it's not
completely finished yet as you can see
but it really does a nice job at
sprucing up here today screen and it has
a lot of the animations and the features
that you can find on touchflo 3d on the
on the higher end HTC devices that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
