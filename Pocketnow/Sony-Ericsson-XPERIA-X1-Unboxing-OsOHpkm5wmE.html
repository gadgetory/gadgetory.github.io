pocketnow.com and today we're going to
unbox the much-anticipated sony ericsson
xperia x1
vice that could represent a breakthrough
for Windows Mobile devices with its
panel interface and innovative design
let's get started alright I'm expecting
a fantastic unboxing experience here
let's see what we have Wow
Xperia Wow that's amazing
I'm going to put this to the side and
we'll talk about in a minute let's see
what else we get in the box it's kind of
dump some of this stuff out we've got
the battery which is of size 1500
milliamp hours good it's a nice size
we've got some it looks like some
headphones with some extra ear gels an
extra stylus non collapsible I like this
I like this very nice a european-style
charger with let's see what kind of cord
it uses yes excellent mini USB this is
what we like to see so far so good let's
see what we have in this other section
over here probably some software and the
like a lot of stuff a lot of stuff
important information Opera Mobile 9.5
this looks like a little getting started
guide support accessories multimedia wow
they really provide a lot of
documentation overview and software
that's a lot alright so let's take a
look at the device
I love this unboxing experience it's set
in this foam it looks beautiful wow it's
a lot smaller than it looks in the
pictures guys it really is
let me flip open the super smooth action
on that and it's got an arc to slider
and the idea behind that is to position
the screen at a better viewing angle
kind of like the Titan 2 that has the
tilting screen feels very solid in hand
the screen is huge three inches let's
take off the screen protector here
I like the brushed aluminum look on this
black finish around the screen 3.2
megapixel camera will cover all of that
soon so let's compare it to some other
devices as we typically like to do let's
look at the the Samsung omnia because
the omnia also is a large screen kind of
a wider screen but of course the sony
ericsson xperia x1 has a much much
higher resolution screen than pretty
much any device out there it has the
maximum screen resolution of any windows
mobile device
let's look at how it compares to the
Titan 2 in terms of thickness the Titan
2 is definitely thicker and let's look
at the HTC touch pro probably a device
that a lot of people are going to
compete comparing the x1 with it's it's
not as it's more narrow it is slightly
thinner and let's take a look at the
keyboards in comparison well I really
love that arc slider so the keys are a
little bigger on the xperia x1 let me
see how they feel they're kind of flat
but I'm sure I'll get used to it so
that'll do it for the unboxing we've got
a ton of coverage coming up on the x1
