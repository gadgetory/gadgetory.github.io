Daniel Webster here from pocket comm and
this is a software tour of the Samsung
jack okay so the first thing you notice
is this is actually a windows mobile 6.1
standard device and we can go through
some of the menus right here we'll just
start off and I don't have the SIM card
in right now but as you can see it says
Wi-Fi and it's connected to my Wi-Fi
router so that's a pretty cool feature
that this device has Wi-Fi enabled so we
go down we can see our missed calls
there's nothing there I'm going to
scroll over to the right and we can see
our voicemail text messages as well as
our email and go back down we can look
at our our calendar so we check our
appointments have no appointments but
it's just the standard Windows Mobile
calendar feature we can just go back and
go down we can play all songs our media
player so if I wanted to play any songs
I can do that here go down again we can
see our photos and scrolling right or
left will show us our photos if we click
on one we can click directly on the
photo we can also zoom in by clicking ok
and we can zoom in or zoom out and it
the zoom feature is pretty neat on this
photo application so we'll just go back
we go down we can switch our profiles so
we can have normal we can also go to our
wireless manager and it's just the
standard Wireless manager we can change
our Wi-Fi our Bluetooth and our phone so
if we wanted it to be enabled we can
turn it on or off I'll just go back and
that's the main ok so if I click start I
can go into the programs the first thing
we have here is messaging of course
that's just our standard text messaging
and our email and go back go to our
calendar we already saw that go to our
context it's the generic Windows Mobile
contact page and we can just click on
them and it'll show us our contact
information give us any notes ActiveSync
of course AT&amp;amp;T music this has some
programs in here that are pretty neat we
have our windows media player we can
shop for music which will launch the
internet browser and get music ID with
we have music ID which is a suzanne
program so we can ID a song by listening
to the song through the headset of XM
radio which is a internet-based radio
program that will has many different
channels on it
that's a subscription-based program we
have music videos which will launch mobi
VJ so that's a like movie TV but it's
for music videos we have music sync and
what this program allows you to do is
actually sync on-demand with your
computer but there's no data connect
currently connected so it's not going to
do that and it will give you a PIN
number and then you put that on to your
PC and it will sync your music library
with your mundos mobile device
over-the-air so it's pretty neat feature
to play your music over the air from
your handset so just go back all set
music community which will launch an
internet browser and our music
applications so if I go in here this
will launch an internet browser as well
we have singular video which is pretty
weird that they still call it singular
video even though there's no singular
anymore and that's just an internet
browser kind of like YouTube we have
media net which will launch the internet
as well
AT&amp;amp;T mall which will allow you to
download programs if you so desire with
AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi and what this is going to do
it's gonna watch the internet browser
and connect you to ATT Wi-Fi hotspots so
it'll show you where Wi-Fi hotspots are
in your area of Internet Explorer AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator which is a subscription-based
navigator program it's about ten dollars
a month we have I am an email so we can
use our IM clients so if we want to
check do that right now we can do that
so you have these three have a m--
Windows Messenger and yahoo messenger so
go back oh just exit ok yes close that
we have an organizer which has our alarm
so we can set our alarms when we want to
wake up and allows for a few more alarms
than the Windows Mobile professional
Edition so that's pretty neat you can
add different alarms let's our
calculator it's pretty easy to
calculator you use it's a proprietary
Samsung calculator so we can just type
in the numbers and use the d-pad to
select which corresponding calculation
one do we also have our d-day we have
d-day which is kind of like a calendar
feature for Windows Mobile standard you
can enter a title and if you want to add
a birthday you can repeat every year
it's a pretty great feature if you want
reminder set up for certain days just go
back you can search and that'll just
allow you to search on your windows
mobile device I have a tip calculator
which will give you a bill amount
percentage and how many ways you want to
split the bill and tasks stopwatch which
is pretty easy to start and stop and
cost record that and our smart converter
so we can convert different currencies
lengths with the volume area and
temperature oops and our voice note so
that will record your voice so you can
make different notes and a world clock
so you can see what time it is and you
can so you can see what time it is in
different time zones according to which
places you would like to see what time
it is my stuff is your your pictures
video sounds whatever kind of documents
you have that it you won't see through
file explorer our games these are demo
versions of Java based games and the
only two that are actually real that you
have full versions of is double breaker
and solitaire which is on pretty much
every windows mobile device go to our
applications we have Adobe Reader light
edition our call history so we can see
how many calls we haven't done here
right now our camera which is actually a
pretty good camera there's a few
settings on here you won't be able to
see too much right now but if we go into
menu you can see there has a camcorder
as well you can change for a multi shot
or frame shot mosaic shot a couple other
shooting modes and change the scene so
if we want a night motor Otto and change
the resolution and the white balance the
ISO so you can changed Auto the metering
area so whatever you want to be metered

effects as well as video sharing and it
is a 3.2 megapixel camera and go to ebay
and that's just a java-based program I
won't go into that right now
mobi TV which is an over-the-air TV
program it allows you to watch some TV
channels on your windows mobile device
mobile banking which another Java based
program Java of course to launch other
Java programs file explorer which is
where you'd like to go if you want to
see any hidden files on your windows
mobile device my cast weather which is a
Java based weather program it is a
subscription-based program photo slides
so if you want to see your photos as a
slideshow you can see those as well and
you can look at your pictures and just
select one and they'll just transition
from one to the next RSS reader so this
comes with its own RSS reader and you
can add your own RSS feeds if you'd like
and or you can choose the ones that are
already in the Samsung Jack the speed
dial you can designate different numbers
so one of course is for voice mail up
most windows mobile devices and most
phones in that matter you have office
mobile so it comes with Excel I added
one note mobile comes with PowerPoint
and word mobile so these will sync out
directly with your PC which is very nice
we have Wickham mobile which is a
another Java based program and of course
task manager and another neat feature
about this is actually shows internet
sharing in your programs which is a
great feature if you want to tether your
Windows Mobile of standard device to
your PC unfortunately for this version
on the Samsung Jack it does not allow
you to select Medianet but I will show
you how to hack that in my next video
this program this this phone has many
restrictions
with security so I will show you that
disk disable those in my next video
and of course settings voice command
which will read your emails text
messages and appointments so this is the
software tour of the Samsung jack and

twitter.com/zeromd companies and remove
and enable the internet sharing thanks
