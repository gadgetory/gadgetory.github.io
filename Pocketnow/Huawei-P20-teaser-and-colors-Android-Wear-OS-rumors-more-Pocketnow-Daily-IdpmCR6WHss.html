and color options for the Huawei p20
where OS seems to be the new name being
cooked for Android where's revival it
seems that there is no more moto or at
least no more moto mods or the x5 I'm hi
mater Iveta and I actually forgot what
day it is today but I would love it if
you would watch our comparison between
the s9 plus and the Galaxy Note 8 this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with product announcements
as well Fitbit announced a few new
products out of which probably the most
popular one was the Versa and I'm not
necessarily gonna say because it's a
better watch I mean hey it looks a lot
like the Apple watch which is not
necessarily bad but I don't understand
why Fitbit launches products that don't
include everything when their watches
like for example I think this would be
the only SmartWatch out there at that
price range which is $200
that doesn't include a GPS that doesn't
make any sense and that was like back in
the day of the time of the surge were
only the search had the GPS verses out
there maybe some of you would be
interested you can learn more about it
in the description
and speaking of wearables for those of
you wondering what the feature of
Android wear is going to be we don't see
it on Google's website but we have some
leaked assets that show us where OS what
is the purpose of Google here I cope
it's bringing something great for
Android wear and hopefully also
providing support for legacy models but
the seem like if a revamp is coming
we're not exactly sure when those stay
tuned probably Google i/o now let's talk
about Lenovo as we've got some
information that is still not official
that there are certain shakeups
happening in Chicago for Motorola or
SATs a report that probably certain
people lost their jobs apparently and we
hear the project's like for example the
Moto X 5 is being killed in addition to
the feature of moto ODS what exactly is
going to happen here we're not sure I I
wish that somebody would just buy
Motorola like hmd is helping out Nokia
right now and figure things out because
this is one brand I really don't want to
die now we've been hearing all the
rumors and all the mess regarding the
komm you know intent to acquire qualcomm
when Paul Keim is not looking to be
bought but they're trying to figure
their way through investors etc etc as
it turns out apparently the US
government has already decided that it
won't allow the Broadcom acquisition
obviously because Barak arm is not a US
company in most way and most of its way
I guess Qualcomm is its providing most
of the innovation that we've seen in the
last couple of years to the United
States when it comes to mobile so of
course I like the fact that the US
government is protecting Qualcomm let's
see what happens going forward as we do
notice that clock them is becoming even
more aggressive about the products they
offer and finally the very interesting
news today I have to do with the Huawei
P 20 we are waiting for these phones
that we've got to separate different
news the first one is some leaked images
of well color options where one of these
is a gradient color it's really cool I
hope that it's also a gradient that
changes color depending on the angle
that you're looking at it that's awesome
but also most interesting is the recent
teasers where Huawei is showing off the
may 10 Pro and comparing it to
photography from regular cameras and
just the versatility of the phone I will
tell you this much that phone takes some
amazing photos expect a video of this
coming very soon but most interesting in
today's question let us know do you
think that smartphone cameras right now
are good enough to replace let's say a
point-and-shoot camera in my case I'll
tell you this much you go to trade shows
right now in events and you see none of
us with a camera taking photos we use
our phones that's amazing I feel that
that's great innovation but leave us a
