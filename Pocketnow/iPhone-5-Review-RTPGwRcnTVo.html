pocket now come and this is our full
review of the iPhone 5 let's get to it
now in its sixth iteration not 5th like
the name would leave you to believe the
iPhone 5 is the biggest change in form
factor yet for the first time Apple is
gone with a 16 by 9 aspect ratio display
a real relief for those that hate the
black bars that show up when you're
watching HD content on the iPhone 4s and
below but then the iPhone 5 cannot
display true HD content because it's
screen resolution is a non-standard 11
36 by 640 instead of the 1280 by 720
resolution we find on many of the latest
Android phones but this doesn't impact
the user much as movies and TV shows
played back in HD is effortlessly
downsample to accommodate the strange
resolution on the iPhone 5 HD content
looks fantastic on the iPhone 5 display
though we'd prefer watching a high def
movie on the galaxy s3 or 1x any day
because there's nothing like a spacious
display for looking at videos then
there's the matter of screen size
consumers obviously want larger screens
a large screen once met a thick form
factor but as HTC is shown with the One
X and a Samsung is shown with the galaxy
s3 you can have a big screen and still
have a thin profile to keep with the
times
Apple increase the display by a mere
half inch to 4 inches as to not impact
the already great one-handed usability
of the device the larger screen is an
improvement especially when looking at
email lists browsing the web or looking
at your Facebook Timeline because you
can see more without having to scroll
but the frustrating placement of the
back button in iOS in the upper left
corner is made worse by the taller
screen if you have small hands hopefully
your thumb is a lot of flexibility and
Android the back button is always on the
bottom of the phone so you're never
having to stretch unless you're opening
the notification shade the screen
quality on the iPhone 5 has improved
versus the forest
color saturation is improved and so is
contrast overall we were hugely
impressed with the quality of the 5s
display as it was extremely well
balanced and super sharp and clear
thanks to the 326 PPI
in terms of touch sensitivity the iPhone
5 now integrates this touch sensor into
the display allowing it to be thinner
has this improved the touch sensitivity
of the display actually no in fact we
found touch sensitivity to feel a little
bit more numb on the iPhone 5 compared
to the 4s it's not a big problem but you
should keep your expectations in check
let's talk about the design of the
iPhone 5 which comes in black or white
your choice of color determines several
things about the phone including the
front plate the tint of the metal on the
back and on the sides and the color of
the four antenna dividers whether you go
with black or white the iPhone 5s back
panel is now aluminum it's a smooth
untextured surface that does a good job
hiding fingerprints and deterring
scratches what doesn't deter scratches
is the polished Apple logo on the back
which scratched after just two days of
careful testing on our unit where the
sides meet the back you get a brilliant
tapered metal edge that looks and feels
extremely precise unfortunately this
edge is prone to chipping and prone to
picking up fingerprints our unit came
from the factory with a nick in this
edge and we're hearing similar reports
from a large fraction of new iPhone 5
owners at the end of the day you're
going to want to put a case on the
iPhone 5 and with Apple not to make a
bumper this time you have to look to a
third party also on the back is the same
8 megapixel camera that was found on the
iPhone 4s except this time there's a
scratch resistant lens and what appears
to be a bigger flash more on the camera
later Apple didn't do away with the
glass on the rear of the phone entirely
there are glass accents that flank the
aluminum backing giving the phone of
beautiful elegance and providing the
user with a second type of texture while
beautiful we worry about how easily it
is to crack these small pieces of glass
as they look difficult to replace
unlike the back glass panel of the 4 and
4s which could be swapped easily on the
bottom of the phone are a bunch of
drilled holes for the speaker which we
found to be louder than on the iPhone 4s
and one of three microphones there's
also the new Lightning charging and
syncing port which we like more than the
bulky and non reversible 30 pin
connector while we understand the
reasons for going to a smaller connector
we wish Apple would have included a free
converter with all new iPhones instead
for charging a ridiculous 29 bucks
and finally on the right side we see the
new nano SIM tray if you have a micro
sim that you want to use it's easy to
trim down the size to fit the nano SIM
tray check out our video tutorial on how
to do so
in hand the iPhone 5 feels remarkable at
seven point six millimeters in depth the
thinness of the phone is absolutely
striking Apple has done a good job at
making the iPhone feel like a
sophisticated and meticulously crafted
device in your head and not only is it
thin but it's insanely lightweight at
112 grams which is lighter than the
lightest phone we can think of the
galaxy s2 it's so light that some are
saying that it feels cheap but we didn't
think that let's talk about specs the
iPhone 5 is running with Apple's a6
dual-core CPU that runs around one
gigahertz in each core it has double the
RAM of its predecessor with one gigabyte
Apple claims that the iPhone 5 is twice
as fast as the 4s is this true to see
for yourself we recommend that you check
out our iphone 5 vs 4s comparison but in
brief we can tell you that yes there's
definitely a significant bump in speed
when opening apps
loading a webpage or just when flipping
through settings whether it's a full 2x
increase we can't be sure but make no
mistake about it the iPhone 5 is fast
you act it responds without lag or
hesitation it confidently can handle
whatever you throw at it
with that said iOS is still heavy with
screen animations which at times can
make the experience feel a little bit
slower running jelly bean on one of the
latest Android phones just feels more
snappy even if the hardware is less
capable than one is inside the iPhone 5
but the iPhone 5 is a gaming monster for
example playing asphalt 7 with the a6
CPU and the higher resolution display
was a highly immersive and fast-paced
experience if you can stand the
tremendous strain on battery most games
like shadow gun haven't been updated for
the higher resolution screen
nevertheless playing it with black bars
on the side was an equally smooth
experience and the iPhone 5 is LTE
whether on AT&amp;amp;T Verizon or Sprint we
tested the iPhone 5 on AT&amp;amp;T LTE network
in Philadelphia and we're able to clock
some extremely impressive LTE speeds of
25 to 50 megabits per second down and
about 10 to 20 megabits per second pop
in terms of Wi-Fi performance the iPhone
5 is slightly better than the 4s in
terms of speed and signal strategy
having LTE on the iPhone dramatically
improves the experience especially if
you have coverage in your area
everything is just fast let's talk about
the software so are there any features
of iOS 6 that are better or different on
the iPhone 5 compared to other iOS
products not exactly although some
features just work better on the iPhone
5 thanks to the better processor for
example flyover in maps is much smoother
on the iPhone 5 if you like that future
also FaceTime over LTE is much better
than FaceTime over 3G beyond that the
iPhone 5 benefits from the many rather
small incremental updates to Apple's
mobile operating systems such as
passbook shared photo streams Siri
functions full screen landscape web
browsing and so forth and if we sound
unexcited about iOS 6 it's because we
pretty much are the iPhone 5 is a taller
screen and Apple is encouraging
developers to do more with their apps
than just stretch them so that they work
on the iPhone 5 so far it looks like
developers are just stretching their
apps we just find by us if you run into
an app that isn't updated for the iPhone
5 you will get black bars on the top and
the bottom which isn't much of a problem
and we anticipate by the end of October
most major apps will have been updated
for the higher res display now let's
talk about some test shows first battery
life apple claims that the iPhone 5 gets
better battery life than on the 4s and
there right but only by a small margin
whereas the iPhone 4s could go an entire
day and no more with heavy use the
iPhone 5 will last a few hours more
under the same conditions more
specifically with heavy web browsing
over LTE and Wi-Fi several calls a few
gaming sessions and some I messaging our
iPhone 5 taken off the charger at 8 a.m.
was at about 20% battery by 11 p.m. not
too bad and onto the camera until the
galaxy s3 came out the iPhone 4s was the
unrivaled champion in photo and video
quality on a smartphone the iPhone 5 is
marginally better but indeed better than
the 4s in photo and video quality
low-light pictures come out better color
saturation is improved and even audio
seems crisper
speaking of the camera the front-facing
camera is now higher resolution and can
take videos in 720p this also means that
FaceTime calls are clearer visually and
our testing FaceTime calls were indeed
higher resolution but only when network
conditions were perfect
how about FaceTime over cellular if your
network allows it well it works with a
disastrous effect on battery life we
should say and the phone heats up a lot
when you do it also there might be a bug
with FaceTime even over Wi-Fi during
several tests cause we got this poor
connection message Apple is trying to
reinvent the earphones with the new ear
pods bundled free with all i phone 5s
they are indeed a huge leap better than
your typical earbud they have more bass
and improved mid-range they just feel a
little strange in the ear or maybe they
just feel different and it's something
to get used to finally we can report
that call quality and in call volume was
fantastic apple claims there is a new
type of noise cancellation and in noisy
environments we had an easy time hearing
the caller on the other end and they
also reported a clear audio connection
also the iPhone 5 supports wideband
audio which is kind of like HD voice but
most carriers including AT&amp;amp;T doesn't
support that just yet so we weren't able
to report on how that works in
conclusion the iPhone 5 is an incredible
phone everything that it does it knows
well it has a great camera it's got
great battery life it has an amazing
enhance high quality feel and as LTE
networking and it has great software at
the end of the day that is very reliable
and that just works that said if you
want a phone that you can customize more
a phone that has a bigger screen and
still as high quality hardware we
recommend the galaxy s3 overall we give
the iPhone a 9 out of 10 thanks for
