they demand an equally advanced charger
that's Microsoft's view anyway and its
newest accessory is a thinner sleeker
and decidedly brighter wireless charging
pad for your Lumia i'm michael fisher
with pocket now and this is our video
review of the dt 903 wireless charging
plate everyone's thinking it so I'll
just say it
that sterols model number doesn't do
this pad justice compared to its
plasticky predecessor the dt 900 the 903
is almost a work of art first of all
it's larger much larger to accommodate
the expanded phone footprints of today
but it's also thinner and heavier
heavier isn't a bad thing either the
added mass combined with the rubber ring
around the base makes the 903 stick
firmly to a tabletop so it doesn't slide
around when you drop a chi enabled
gadget on its large charging surface and
whether that gadget is a Windows Phone a
google phablet or an Android wearable
the 9:03 indicates it's charging with a
bright glow that radiates from its
underside and bounces off the surface
it's resting up on our unit here that
glow is green but the 9:03 comes in both
orange and white versions as well
amnon windows devices the charging
itself is as exciting as it get but swap
in a modern Lumia smartphone and
suddenly you've got a much smarter
charger once you tap the Lumia to the
NFC contact point and accept the pairing
request the phone and charger establish
a Bluetooth le handshake and the charger
is transformed into one big notification
light for your windows phone texts
emails and other alerts trigger a
pattern of abrupt flashes while a low
battery level on your phone sets off a
gently breathing blow letting you know
your phone needs a top-up if that's not
your bag or you want to change your
alert options but that's as simple as
diving into the device hub where simple
means digging down way way down into
Windows Phones never-ending settings
menu but thankfully you can pin a
shortcut to the charger settings right
to the Start screen to skip that you can
control everything from the glows
brightness to which apps set it off to a
specified window of dark time so you can
get some sleep without a bright UFO glow
waking you up
the 903 isn't perfect as with the Lumia
830 it's weird that the Nokia brand
remains emblazoned on the hardware even
after the Microsoft acquisition also it
doesn't come with a wall adapter so
you've got to provide your own or plug
it into a USB port on your computer
surface pro 3 and MacBook Air each
provided plenty of power during our
testing also most of the usual downsides
to wireless charging apply here
it doesn't charge as rapidly as
traditional wired chargers its pricier
than just buying a spare cable and you
really can't use the phone comfortably
while it's charging unless you're
sitting at a desk but look if those
practical considerations are what you're
all about this isn't the accessory for
you anyway wireless charging is for
folks tired of fussing with cables for
those who just bought a Lumia 830 and
can't figure out why in the name of
Edison anyone would put a charging port
at the top of a smart phone most of all
though it's for people who want to taste
a futuristic Flair with their futuristic
phone and in that respect this device
delivers like the Delta flyer the DT 903
charger is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0
in abled windows phones running version
8.1 and higher it'll come to Microsoft
retail stores in the coming weeks and
it's available from Microsoft calm right
now for $59 be sure to check out our
other windows phone coverage folks
including an 8:30 vs. 9:30 comparison a
Lumia 930 after the buzz rear review and
a pocket net weekly podcast full of
heated debate about the Microsoft app
gap also be sure to tune in next week

more comparisons till next time there's
