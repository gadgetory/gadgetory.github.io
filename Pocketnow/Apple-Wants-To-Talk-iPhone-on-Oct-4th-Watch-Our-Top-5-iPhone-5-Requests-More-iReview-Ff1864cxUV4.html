scheduled for October fourth we wrap up
all the rumors of what we should expect
for the new iPhone and we also go
through our top five requests for the
next generation iphone all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi I'm enemy veteran and welcome to the
pocket mail I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices this week is going to be
different because everything that we
have to talk about is cool the new
iphone is coming up next week so let's
begin talking about it Apple has finally
begun shipping invitations for their
official October fourth event and the
title of the event is let's talk iphone
it doesn't get any more definitive than
that the show will begin a 10 a.m.
pacific time and will be held in apple's
headquarters in Cupertino California
we're still not sure if steve jobs will
be there to surprise everyone with
another steve note but rumors habit of
this will be the first tim note or a
cook note or cookie notes whatever
anyways expect our full coverage of the
event on next tuesday and let's hope we
do get something good alright so let's
go through rumor mill and see what's
expected for the next generation iphone
apples dual-core a5 chip as a given we
don't even have to beg for that one a
better 8 megapixel camera is also in the
mix and most probably a given though we
still don't know what to make of the
front-facing video camera that really
sucks it stills rumors have it that
apple will also likely build a true
world phone that will fit every carrier
with just one device and actually even
reach 21 megabits per second through
hspa+ no LTE will probably be released
as of rumors and well sprint is also in
the mix though we're not sure what to
make for tmobile just yet apple seems to
also prepare an exclusive version of iOS
5 that but Siri and nuance technology to
provide a revolutionary voice service
somewhat some people speculate that the
service will be called assistant and
will smartly assist you in doing your
everyday tasks just like you do with a
real assistant hopefully and while many
rumors also have it that Apple's
releasing two iphones and iphone
5 which brings a dramatically new design
and a boosted iphone 4s judging by
recent rumors and even the invitation
icon for the events apple provides we
really don't believe that Apple will be
releasing two devices we see that Apple
will most likely release one we're still
not sure if Apple will be releasing
iphone 5 or an iphone 4s but whatever
happens will be something that only the
event will be able to reveal some of us
believe that since Apple is most likely
launching the ipod line up within the
same event then most likely Apple will
be launching the ipod touch 5 and
actually use that large four inch
display design thinner design that
people were rooming around to be the
iphone 5 and actually have that be the
ipod touch 5 to embrace gamers with a
larger screen but again time will tell
okay so probably the biggest question
everybody has is when will Apple release
the next generation iphone after
announcing it and we'll set your
calendars for october fourteenth just
ten days after the event because rumors
have it that Apple is currently blacking
out vacations for their employees and
even the supported carriers are doing
the same thing if we all remember back
in time the iPad to launch happened the
same way almost 10 days after it was
announced so most likely this rumor does
hold water Apple will most likely
prepare for the usual pandemonium of
crazy people making lines out there and
you bet it will most likely be making a
line to out there for hours and well now
that we've gone through a week of news
and rumors let's end Today Show with our
first ever top five this is the top five
requests for iphone 5 features according
to all our editors call this the video
edition for all our YouTube followers of
the article that we posted earlier this
week number 5 a dual-core even quad-core
cpu if possible i mean apples a5 chip is
most likely a given for this device but
in a world where dual-core is already a
standard we'd like to see apple race the
bar in performance and while we all know
that iOS 5 beta is currently working
well on the a5 chip of the ipad 2 but
the iphone 4 is a4 chip is really
struggling so this change is really a
must obviously we can touch apple by
beta but still I mean apples sometimes
does a really great job in staying way
behind on specs and other times they
come up with things like the retina
display which was totally out of market
and really cool so let's hope they
surprises number four more storage I
mean heck if Apple didn't release iCloud
or iTunes Match we call this the number
one requested feature for many of us I
mean many of us believe that Apple is
comfortable with competition because
they're not really doing a good job and
bumping storage on their devices surely
you can get 32 gigabytes or more on any
current android smartphone out there if
you buy a microSD card to fit it in but
what happens when you already paid top
premiun bucks for that device and still
have to pay more money in the world
where nova and rage HC are currently
eating up to one gigabyte of storage on
your device Apple better come up with 64
gigabytes of storage on this new device
hopefully number three a larger and
thinner design i mean people might not
remember this but back when the first
generation iphone was released 2.4 inch
screens were the standard back then so
the 3.5 inch screen that was released
with the iphone was huge it was massive
but that was sadly half a decade ago and
these times four inches are pretty much
the standard and apple better come up
with something big I mean they could
still retain their retina display brand
if you could do the math for a 4-inch
display and the larger device will also
allow a larger battery and you know what
that means number 21 device to rule all
carriers Apple has shown everybody that
there is a way to rebel against carriers
and get away with it all you have to do
is push out a must-have device and
carriers will go crazy with you trying
to sell that device on their network and
get it so how about if Apple could
probably fill carriers with something
really really good and probably get away
with the fact that we can probably use
our device on all networks probably I
could buy it on AT&amp;amp;T and eventually
choose to change the verizon probably
pay a couple of fees there and just
switch easily switch and keep my same
iPhone that would be awesome and before
we get to the number one request let's
hit the ones that didn't make the list
but we're still really good a better
camera I mean especially the
front-facing camera the current one is
as grainy as
graney means by the dictionary I mean
Apple does a really good job with the
back camera and most probably the 8
megapixel camera will be there but still
if you want to take self-portraits or
anything it's kind of awkward to be
holding your device and then turning it
around and taking a picture of yourself
will be really cool to have a really
good front facing camera and hopefully
Apple will not come out with that 720p
video camera that still shoots crazy
ugly stills anyways and the number one
pocket now requested feature for the
iphone 5 everybody is LTE this decade is
all about speed and well marketing
specialists are doing a really good job
in marketing hspa+ 4g but you and I
power users know that 4G is LTE or wimax
curly in the United States the standard
is LT because most probably Sprint will
be moving on to LTE and many may debate
whether it's really worth its implement
4G LTE on a smartphone but still i mean
if Apple wants to build a future-proof
device a device that will probably work
for the next two years that you'll be
stuck on a contract LTE will be
something in porn as of next year so
Apple most likely needs to work on
building LTE to their devices let's hope
that our dreams come true and while
leave us a comment build on below if you
have any other features that you'd like
for the iphone 5 4 s or 4g to bring and
that we probably missed that's it for
