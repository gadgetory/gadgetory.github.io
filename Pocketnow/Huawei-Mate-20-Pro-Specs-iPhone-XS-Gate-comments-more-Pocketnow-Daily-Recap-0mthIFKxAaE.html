knotch I know right the pixel aircraft
carrier time it'll be that have a king
of at some point for reviews lol what
are you implying every time I hear your
name I picture you on a late-night spot
in a silk robe sitting in a recliner
with a seafood platter saying your name
for four hours straight that is some
imagination that's right it's that time
of the week I am how you met Aviva now
this is PocketNow and this is the
bargain out daily recap your comments
for last week so on Monday the topic was
the oneplus 60 were very close to its
event and there were some in real life
leaks and I asked you what do you think
about design we had 408 comments no
headphone jack equals settle yes
definitely there are a ton of things
that equal settle but I would have to
agree that that's probably the top one
oneplus without headphone equals one
minus the fact that this was the comment
that was most voted because yes I do
have to agree I mean I feel that there
are better ways to be innovative than to
get rid of features that are essential
the headphone jack will be officially
dead when Samsung and LG drop it
I wonder if Samsung and LG will be
willing to drop it as the question I
feel that they're very invested with
this but I hope that they don't prove me
wrong then on Tuesday the topic was
iPhone connectivity issues a lot of us
are having problems with our iPhones
like yesterday I was at a bar and
literally every other phone that I was
carrying was connected its second for
the iPhone it indicated there was signal
it just didn't provide me any data
I asked you what were you having any of
these issues and we had 539 comments
imagine paying the price for a used car
to have connectivity issues pretty much
that is my biggest problem you should
not be dealing with these kinds of
problems with a product that is so
expensive it is supposed to be the
premium the cream of the crop I'm having
major issues with the iPhone 10s
I can't afford it exactly that is the
biggest problem that you should not be
dealing with these kinds of problems
well the product that's so expensive
people are having issues affording it no
man it's an awesome feature they want
you to focus on your work and don't
leave your desk it's Apple mobile
industry's first innovation it's called
focus area seriously I love your irony
man and then on Wednesday the topic was
the rating of Consumer Reports already
considering the Galaxy Note 9 as the
best smartphone of 2018
while we're early I asked you what was
your favorite smartphone of 2018 so far
we had 850 comments
I agree the Galaxy Note 9 is the best
smartphone of 2018 so far I'm glad it's
getting some highlights because it's
worth it the note 9 has highlights
regardless of the rating I do feel that
at this moment it is the best phone you
can buy but then again it's not for
everybody and I was very clear about
that in my review yes it is the best
best overall there are phones that beat
it in singular categories but no phone
does it all better than the note true
that I have to agree the Galaxy Note is
probably the phone that the liver is the
best out of every single thing
photography user interface simply just
the features it's got a little of
everything that does everything really
well Samsung is so late with updates
can't crown them as the best alright
thank you for correcting me true that is
one thing they get wrong but because of
the features of the S Pen I get that
software updates take them a little
longer even if that a little longer is
buy the next generation of the phone
there's the limo waiting birthday like
seriously Bao and then on Thursday the
topic was a huawei mate 20 Pro we saw
some impressive specifications being
leaked I asked you what do you think we
had 577 comments Huawei is so underrated
with its general audience here in
America I hope that the maid 20 finally
gets people excited about something
other than Apple and Samsung the moment
that it is able to be sold in the United
States sadly
imagine mate 20 pro with stock Android
oh wow that I you know I would love it
if we would go back to the Google
edition of phones and you could pick
like the moment you buy a product you'd
be like yeah I want the Google edition
of that and I wish they would help me
prove a point that people actually want
less bloat the next generation of
smartphone is the made 20 pro if the
leaks are true of everything that we've
seen is real this is true Huawei has
been doing an amazing job at pushing
innovation I hate that they're having
issues with the United States because I
wish everybody had a chance to test them
out particularly the p20 Pro so yet and
then finally Friday at a topic was the
Google pixel three excel it came up in a
Russian Channel and a full hands-on I
asked you what you thought we had six
hundred fifty-three comments I still
hope that this is some kind of prank by
Google I do hope so too
mainly because of that screen but hey
man I mean at this point I honestly
don't think so but we could be proven
wrong pixel three excel is a notch above
the rest
in what particular case bad design yeah
probably
they should have just named it the notch
that would have been an amazing way to
just differentiate it I don't know man I
mean it's just funny like Google I wish
Google understood that particular part
of design I feel they've gotten the back
of phones well designed for a while but
then the pixel one had the biggest
Chin's ever the pixel to excel well we
know that it's bezels weren't the best
and now we get this like really Google I
know you guys could do better than this
but anyways that's just me we'll see
what we end up getting at the event
friends that's it for the parking out
