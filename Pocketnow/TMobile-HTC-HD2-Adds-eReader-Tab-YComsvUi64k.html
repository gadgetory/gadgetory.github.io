pocketnow.com we've seen how the tmobile
hd2 rums have brought brought new
features such as the documents reader to
HTC Sense the latest version of this rom
version 2.0 7 brings a new feature that
allows you to use your hd2 as an
e-reader and download ebooks from
borders it's really cool let's take a
look so we're going to slide to the
right and we're going to land on the i
missed it back here the new tab reader
it's not too often that we see HTC add
new tabs but here we have a new one so
basically you can flick through the
books that you have and right now I've
got 10 books loaded on to this rom and
we can tap on any of them to bring up
the book I'll show you that in a second
where I can tap library down here again
and get the HTC Sense library very nice
this looks the same as it would look for
your music or for your movies are things
like that we can slide to the right and
go to archived items and then we can go
to the right here we can log into the
borders bookstore we really haven't seen
borders get into ebooks in a really big
way perhaps they're finally starting to
make partnerships with cell phone
companies like HTC and so on and they're
going to have a presence I've tried to
log in or create an account and it
didn't work so obviously this isn't set
up yet and borders isn't streaming or
providing the store to HTC quite yet but
let's take a look at the book reading
experience so let's go to one of these
books let's read Dracula so we tap on it
and then we get page one and what we can
do is swipe to the right and table of
contents and we can zoom in by using the
multi-touch of the hd2 and it resizes
all of the the contents of the page to
nicely fit we can jump to a particular
chapter just by tapping on the link and
then it becomes a very nice and pleasant
reading experience we can flick to the
right flick to the left just like you
would be able to do on say the apple
ipad when that comes out and we can of
course change the size of the text like
so and it takes a second but it will
reflow quite nicely so a surprising
really very good reading experience on
the HTC hd2 and we really haven't
seen anything like this yet for any
other cell phone platform with this type
of integration with the interface so we
can go back here we can click on another
book we can search for the books up here
and and so on and so forth so very nice
new tab we're looking forward to seeing
how this evolves and how the integration
with borders works the other change to
this 2.07 rom is that swype is included
we did a video demonstrating swype which
is a really fast way to input text into
your device the idea is that you connect
the letters with a line and this isn't
actually working i don't think so if i
do this it's it's not working on this
round but we did a demo before a really
awesome way to to type it really
increases your speed so guys that was
just a quick look at the new 2.07 rom
for the HTC hd2 heading to t-mobile it's
nice to see that we're seeing even more
enhancements and changes come to HTC
Sense before we saw the documents reader
and now we are seeing now we are seeing
the the reader panel just quite nice
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
