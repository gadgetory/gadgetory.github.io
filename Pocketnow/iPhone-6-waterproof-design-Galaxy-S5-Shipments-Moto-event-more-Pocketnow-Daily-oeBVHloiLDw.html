6 being a waterproof phone reports have
samsung shipping 10 million galaxy s
five units in record time and LG is
doing a ton of announcements including
the G watch details I'm high memory that
I and I was supposed to have off today
guys but since I love you all this is
 out daily let's start today off
the way we like it with the official
news as LG has just announced new
tablets even though the G pad's were
great they're announcing some more now
we have a seventh and eighth and the
10-inch variant of the tablets like so
there's repair full details aren't
specifications these are quite
compelling and obviously we can't wait
to get them in our Park now laughs to
give them a test ride but as I found
that the company has also just launched
this teaser video of the G watch and one
of the most interesting hints is that
apparently this thing will work on one
charge and the question is exactly what
this LG plan to do with this battery and
what can I enjoyed where to do for that
so um we'll see how that goes now let's
talk about some unofficial announcements
that are kind of interesting is we have
reports that Samsung has shipped shipped
10 million galaxy s 5 units in 25 days
which is a record the gs4 took 27 days
and then the gs3 took a couple of weeks
and then it took months for the gs2 and
the galaxy original was even worse but
this is great obviously this means that
the company is boosting more sales even
though we know that there are complaints
about the camera on the galaxy s5 but
just remember these are shipments
Samsung does not report how many devices
they've actually sold so whether these
are rotting in some store shelf renata
is really interesting what phone did you
get you get the galaxy s5 now let's talk
about motorola as the company has an
announcement for tomorrow and they've
begun teasing what to expect and hashtag
I hate saying this but hashtag goodbye
flip phones which they invented they
invented this category but it seems that
Motorola's alluding that they will
launch more entry-level and affordable
phones to get rid of the entry-level
market they did that with the Moto G and
apparently that's going to happen today
as well so let's see what we get
tomorrow this is going to be quite
interesting now talk about HTC and it's
come back to Windows Phone as famous
tipster applique sis just shown us
renders of the HTC w8 which is pretty
much the One m8 the only difference is
that instead of running Android it's
running Windows Phone 8.1 and it'll keep
the same design and almost the same
specifications we're not sure of the
ultrapixel camera will also make it here
but uh this is really interesting a lot
of us have been waiting for another HTC
windows phone and this could probably be
the most compelling one and finally for
the interesting news of the day new
reports have it that Apple might
consider bringing the iphone 6 in a
waterproof design and yeah there are
some leaked photos out there am a dummy
being tested but there are other
compelling rumors that state that
apparently the company is considering
this technology for the next design of
the iphone but obviously it's really
hard to confirm right now but it is the
trend that's happening starting with
motor oil and some other companies but
that leads me to the question of the day
how important would a phone being
waterproof BTW you for your next
purchase because in my particular case i
feel that it will be a need i feel that
my phone should be waterproof next
coming up and I do feel that it should
be a standard I mean what is taking so
long but there was a comment down below
what do you think in front you know the
drill if you want to get the news
