resolution photos on the next iPhone LG
announces a 5.5 inch 4k display that
could be used on the g3 and we get more
hints of the Moto X plus one coming soon
I'm hi Marilee that I and the ironic
part about Thursday's is the fact that
you can drink all you want and then have
to work the next day this is out
daily let's begin today with the
official news as Google has just brought
a new update to its google play services
to version 4.4 and reason why this is
cool is because the company is adding
new features and functionality aside
from other api's for developers like for
example additional integration would
street view aside from the fact that now
the phone can detect the way you move
how much you walk your steps and
actually provide that information for
applications as well interesting it
seems that Fitness will be the new deal
right swarovski right I got it right ok
swarovski for samsung has just been
announced this new lineup of accessories
will be available on a samsung store as
it made 20 seconds and now you can get
all those crystals in the back of your
phone with back covers and other
different accessories that will make
your phone what is it gonna be called
pimp my phone instead of pin my ride I
don't know interesting something cool
coming in not sore about LG as the
company has just announced a quad HD
display or its probable future g3 as
this display is a 5.5 inch display
that's got 2560 x 1440 pixels in
resolution which is a hundred pixels per
inch more than any phone out there right
now which is great it's interesting but
I'm talking about any phone with 1080p
display so it's great to see that we are
getting more innovation we just need to
see when exactly are we getting this now
talk about motorola and that's actually
the company that still builds phones for
lenovo now and we get more rumors and
these are actually leaks from motorola
of the Moto X plus one is it's being
teased for AT&amp;amp;T and aside from that the
teasers also include the fact that there
are other options we've talked about
that and aside from that that it'll be
below four hundred dollars on the price
tag in this
Billy which is great let's just hope we
get it soon even they keep the same
design and we just get you know new back
covers and finally for the interesting
news of the day Apple has just filed a
new patent for super resolution photos
and the concept is pretty much would you
get on the Oppo find 7 which is you take
a photograph and it'll actually take
photographs on different angles and
they'll give you a 50 megapixel shot
like you get on the fine seven again and
that was just paddling this technology
because apparently Apple wants to use
optical image stabilization for this to
work so start to tell that I'm coming
the iphone 6 or not but uh you know I
guess Apple is just trying to find the
way to not give us more megapixels it
seems a lazy to the question of the day
what do you think about this whole
concept of super resolution photos
because in my particular case i prefer
the nokia approach the 41-megapixel shot
where i can zoom in and out videos etc
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think and friends you know the
