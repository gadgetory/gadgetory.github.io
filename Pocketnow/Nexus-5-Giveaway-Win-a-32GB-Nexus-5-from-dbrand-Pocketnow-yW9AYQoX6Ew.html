this smartphone but I wish it had just a
few more color options besides white and
black and maybe read or maybe you find

color options and those wooden backs are
awesome but I just can't live without a
5-inch screen or a bleeding edge
processor and then maybe you find
yourself saying gosh if only I could
have it both ways if only at awesome
