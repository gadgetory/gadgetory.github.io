pocket now calm now Windows Mobile has
been able to cut copy and paste for a
pretty long time well at least the
professional touchscreen version but
what about the non touchscreen version
well in this video I'm going to show you
how to do cut copy and paste in Windows
Mobile non touchscreen devices I think a
lot of people don't realize that this
capability exists it's actually a very
new capability that only came around
with windows mobile 6.1 6.0 did not have
it so I'm gonna show you on the non
touchscreen version then we're gonna do
a review of the touchscreen version of
Windows Mobile on how to cut copy and
paste so let's get a little closer on
the screen and this is the samsung
propelled pro and we are going to go to
a place where there is text so i'm gonna
go into internet explorer and here we've
got pocketnow.com mobile loaded so I
want to take some of this text and put
it in an email or a word document or
wherever you're putting text and the way
that you do it is you go to the write
soft key here menu and you go to the
bottom copy and paste over to the right
and do select text now what you do now
is position the cursor where you want
the highlighting to start so let's say
we want to take the first sentence the
glorious HTC snap and go to the end of
the sentence right there so we click on
the select button and we bring the
cursor down to where we want the
highlighting to stop so we're gonna go
to the end of HTC device right there you
click copy and now you go to where you
want the text to go so let's go into
messaging and we'll make a new text
message so now we position the cursor
where you want the text to go just as if
you were cut copying and pasting on a
regular computer and go to menu and then
down to copy paste and hit paste there
it is so for Windows Mobile touchscreen
or professional it's actually a little
bit easier than that because you have
the control being able to tap on the
screen so here we are in Wikipedia and
let's say we're looking something
looking up something interesting about
Japan and we want to send this we want
to put this into a document so let's
find some text we want to highlight so
I'm gonna take the whole paragraph here
from Japan all the way down to the end
of the sentence do a little too much
there alright and now what you do is
you tap and hold on the text that you
selected and you do copy quite simple
right now we're gonna open up word
mobile all right so here's word mobile
and quite simply you tap and hold and do
paste and there it is very easy so it's
quite easy to copy and paste in Windows
Mobile both non-touchscreen and
touchscreen just a quick review on how
to do these functions that are pretty
important in using your device and
getting around for more tips and tricks
