the iPhone 10 doesn't mean we can't have
a little fun with an Android iPhone
showdown how does the iPhone 8 compare
against the top premium offering from
Samsung stable upon Carlos Magna here
for pocket now and here's our note 8 vs.
iPhone 8 plus comparison brought to you
by deeper and I like to kick these off
with design and there's just no contest
here Samsung has won most of these
fights and against the iPhone they win
again against a newer bolder note the
iPhone 8 represents the fourth
generation of iPhone to use this
aesthetic apples take on glass is a bit
more resistant to fingerprints but I
think we can move on display tech is
another obvious win for Samsung with a
taller higher resolution juicier AMOLED
the iPhone screen is more than capable
of getting your work done but again this
LCD and aspect ratio feel a bit dated
switching to the tech inside this fight
is a lot more interesting there's no
denying the insane horsepower delivered
by Apple's new a11 chipset again handily
leapfrogging the best that Qualcomm has
to offer it's also a testament to
optimization that Apple can deliver such
smooth multitasking performance with
half the RAM of this competitor the note
will obviously keep more apps running in
RAM though I'm not usually that guy who
has six games in Google Earth loaded on
my phone at all times
speaking of gaming the iPhone delivered
smoother performance in our Troublesome
benchmark Marvel future fight which is
poorly optimized for Android but other
comparable titles were neck-and-neck the
iPhone produces significantly bigger
numbers in a synthetic bench but we're
not seeing many apps truly taking
advantage of that power just yet outside
of a few that load a bit quicker the
Samsung's focus on the note is in
everything in the kitchen sink hardware
platform Apple has caught up on wireless
charging and water resistance but you
can always count on Sammy to include
more stuff like a heart rate sensor iris
scanning and yeope still has a headphone
jack the crown jewel feature of course
is the s-pen a holy unique method of
input transforming the note into a
different tier of productivity product
it's a neat addition to be sure but one
that offers significant and notice
benefits over say apples 3d touch Apple
does have one disruptive trick up its
sleeve though augmented reality has the
potential to affect nearly every app and
service on our phones that Apple can
deliver excellent world tracking
performance without a bevy of cameras
and sensors on the back is a phenomenal
achievement software is also an
interesting fight iOS 11 is improving on
areas we've been critical like file
management and app integration plus it's
still a handy winner for communication
services like iMessage and FaceTime like
hardware Samsung just gives you more a
layer of Samsung UI lives on top of
Android changing the interaction
depending on how you hold the thing edge
panel shortcuts for one hand use stylus
interface for two-handed work plus
Google and Samsung are well ahead on
more advanced multitasking like split
screening apps whether you want simple
and familiar or more options for
customization and navigation will
largely come down to which ecosystem a
user has already invested in the audio
game is a win for the iPhone the stereo
speakers on the A+ are noticeably better
than the notes mono bottom firing unit
the headphone game is pretty close
though even considering the dongle
quality numbers are neck-and-neck but
the iPhone has a slightly punchy ramp we
will admit though that the Galaxy is the
more convenient solution and also they
include better earbuds with the price of
the phone the camera battle is also
increasingly nuanced the two seem to be
built to compete directly against each
other the iPhones horsepower and
software optimization delivers some
incredible benefits smaller photo and
video sizes more consistent HDR
processing a higher resolution 240
frames per second slow motion and 4k
video at 60 frames per second the note
is no slouch though delivering better
low-light performance faster and more
accurate autofocus a more complete app
with manual controls and Hardware
stabilization on the zoom sensor even a
feature like their respective portrait
modes is a conversation of pros and cons
Apple tracking depth information for
better lighting filters but Samsung
allowing finer adjustments to the blur
effect and capturing a photo from the
main sensor to use as a safety net it's
been a long while since Samsung and
Apple cameras have felt so evenly
matched Samsung does pull a win for
battery life however where we would
normally praise Apple's efficiency as
iPhone chipsets have gotten more
powerful the gap in runtime has widened
in our streaming bench that galaxy takes
a significantly draining a smaller
percentage of a larger battery this is
echoed in our recharge test the iPhone
supporting fast charging just you don't
get a fast charger in the box like you
do with the note the note is not the
fastest recharge we've ever clocked but
it easily defeats the iPhone lastly the
cost comparison isn't as far off the
mark as the price tags might indicate
unlocked direct from each manufacturer a
hundred and thirty dollar separates the
two but the note does ship with better
ear buds and that fast chargers in the
box
considering the stylus as an accessory
the note eights premium over the iPhone
doesn't feel as significant so let's
wrap this up where's that leave us
between the note 8 and the iPhone 8 plus
this was actually a lot closer than I
thought it would be for all of our
criticisms on the iPhone 8 swarm does
9 it does bring some really cool tech to
the table it would be short-sighted to
write off something like augmented
reality after apples investments in AR
KITT developer tools still we have to
give the overall win to Samsung the note
8 is just a more exciting offering
boundary-pushing design the more
complete package for work and even for
our concerns over costs it manages to
make a compelling argument for that
sticker price when compared against
Apple's larger iPhone of course we all
know this was just an hors d'oeuvre of a
comparison as we wait to compare
Samsung's 900 ish dollar phone against
Apple's thousand dollar fare hikes
thousand dollar mobile tech investments
spending that much on a pocket
supercomputer doesn't it deserve a
little pampering a little care team
