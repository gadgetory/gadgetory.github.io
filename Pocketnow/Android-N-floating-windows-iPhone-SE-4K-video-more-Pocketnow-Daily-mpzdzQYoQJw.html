expect for the camera of the iphone SE e
we get more details on UI improvements
for android n and microsoft when i
finally deliver on some old and broken
promises with windows 10 mobile I'm hi
Mary vera and yeah I needed this haircut
really badly I think I lost like ten
pounds or something this is parking out
daily the official news today start with
Microsoft I will not recommend that you
hold your breath but it seems that the
windows 10 mobile is on target to reach
existing Lumia devices starting tomorrow
yeah we've been waiting a very long time
for this and after the major flop of the
new lumias it's about time let's just
hope it doesn't cripple our existing
devices speaking of products we've been
waiting a long time for let's include
the PlayStation VR which was teased a
very long time ago and we finally get
details on it seems that the product is
being slated for October that it'll cost
you four hundred dollars and we still
don't understand exactly why we have to
wait so long given all the VR headsets
already out there but hey let's just
hope it pulls over all the hype and even
though Apple has been slowly plateauing
as we didn't expect I phones to sell
like crazy forever it seems that
analysts are already predicting that it
might continue apparently they are
raising their predictions for this
quarter 250 6.5 million units 55 billion
for when it comes to revenues so let's
just see if Apple can pull it off as a
the galaxy s7 is out something has to
change here and speaking of predictions
we hear more about the iphone SE we have
a tipster claiming that this device is
actually going to be capable of 4k video
meaning that the camera might not be the
slouch that we currently already know
for of entry-level iphones do you call
it that way let's just call them old
iphones yeah it seems that the iphone SE
might follow on the tracks of the iphone
success when it comes to the camera
sensor probably 12 megapixels but again
there are still more to wait for march
21st and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with android and what
is apparently being dubbed internally
New York cheesecake I wish they had a
shorter name but anyways point here is
that apparently google is a testing out
new ways to do split window multitasking
we already saw how it works on
smartphones and tablets but apparently
there are also floating windows in the
mix which would pretty much turn android
into what chrome oh I should have always
been and it would be great but it does
lead me to the question of the day what
floating windows on tablet user
interfaces make you want to adopt
Android M an Android tablet in my case
probably it depends on exactly how
powerful these are splitting windows can
be or floating windows can be because
historically Android tablets haven't
really sold well leave us a comment down
