this is a Motorola Xoom running Android
3.2 honeycomb we're gonna see what it
looks like now and what it looks like
running Ice Cream Sandwich version 4.0
let's go take a look
all right so this is the Motorola Xoom
it's the launch device the partner
launch device for Android version 3
which is codenamed honeycomb this has
been updated over-the-air still stock
we're not running a custom ROM here and
it's up to Android 3.2 point 1 it's
still honeycomb if you missed out on our
last video it was kind of an editorial
about how honeycomb wasn't necessary
evil you may want to pause this video
and go and watch that one just to kind
of get a feeling about what honeycomb is
and was and why it's kind of gotten a
bad name or a black guy there are some
reasons why and well we explain it all
in that video so this is what we've got
let's go ahead and take a look now right
here we've got our home screen in fact
we've got lots of different home screens
that we can choose from as you scroll
back and forth you can kind of see a
outline with a fade in of the apps
coming from the next panel really kind
of a cool effect if you want to move
something you tap and drag and you can't
see it all that well will come over here
down by the moon and you can kind of see
a plus sign down there there's a grid of
pluses that shows up on the screen that
lets you kind of line up and define
where you're going to be placing these
icons you also have resizable widgets so
if we tap and hold on this we have these
little grabbing points these little
diamonds so we can come in here and
resize this widget to to fit the space
really kind of cool what they've done
there and that's carried through to
version 4.0 which is Ice Cream Sandwich
and you've seen that on the Galaxy Nexus
that we've shown you in other videos so
kind of cool what you've got there this
is also the first one that has done this
where you've got an apps and a kind of a
my apps type drawer they're not really
widgets per se in this view in fact if
we go back home if you want to drop a
widget on the screen you still have to
tap and hold and then you get you know
your widgets absalom papers and more
that you can do from here a little bit
different than what we've come to see on
Ice Cream Sandwich I like how you've got
your screens up here and you can simply
drag and
drop from this area to that area to put
things where you want to go but I like
having the apps and widgets in the same
drawer like we have an Ice Cream
Sandwich so kind of interesting this
like I've shown you in other videos has
something called fragments and what's a
fragment I'll show you here a little bit
if you look over on this side this is a
list and this is another content so if
we want to add a new note over here we
can add a new note in the list and see
the content over there in the view if
this were Gmail for example we would
have our Gmail list right here all of
our incoming emails and we would have
the body of the selected email over
there on a smartphone it's kind of this
is one view you select what you want and
then you have the other view in there so
it's kind of separated out but from a
development from a coding standpoint
it's really the same thing it's the same
logic you don't have to write the app
twice to be able to do it this is also
where we've got our picker our task
manager if you will we wanted to get rid
of this we can't if you notice an Ice
Cream Sandwich we have kind of a swipe
to dismiss well you don't have that in
this one you've just got you know tap to
switch into it so one of the cooling is
about Ice Cream Sandwich that's really
all I have to say about honeycomb it's
it's honeycomb and it does what it does
and that's about it you've got kind of
notification bar over here and soft
buttons down here back home and your
multitask button these fade away effects
so does this one kind of fades into just
dots when you're in an app like Netflix
for example Netflix is another good
example of of those fragments there's a
different view in the smartphone version
Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich then
there is in a honeycomb view or even an
Ice Cream Sandwich view on a tablet just
because the tablets got a bigger screen
so there we go
here's kind of your status indicator
lots of cool stuff in there but it's
been really laggy honeycomb does not
have GPU acceleration for the the core
launcher
if you want to GPU accelerate your app
like if you've got a game you can do
that you just have to put a couple lines
of code into your app to turn it on Ice
Cream Sandwich it's turned on by default
so that'll be really cool to see how
their performance improves from this to
the next one I'm gonna go ahead and run
quadrant here if I can do that and I'll
show you the score here shortly it's not
optimized for tablets so it kind of kind
of wonky how it moves all around and
does that you can see my fingerprints
really well on there but it's going
through and running the test it hasn't
scored really well in the past probably
isn't going to do too good here so we'll
see what it does on Ice Cream Sandwich
as well
okay so flashing Ice Cream Sandwich on
to the zoom was really really easy what
we're gonna do now is just unlock now
you'll notice we've got the Ice Cream
Sandwich style unlocker
unfortunately we don't have face unlock
like we have on the Galaxy Nexus if we
come over here to security and take a
look our screen lock we have none slide
a pattern pin and password we don't have
face on locket I don't know why but
looking down here at the bottom we can
see we've got the new Ice Cream Sandwich
back home and multitask if we come into
multitask we can see now we can easily
dismiss these very fast very quick
looking over here we've got the new
icons the new Roboto font which honestly
looks so much nicer than the font that
we had on here before I really didn't
acknowledge or respect just how much
crisper and clearer that font looked
when it was on the Galaxy Nexus but now
that I see it on the zoom I'm really
impressed so let's go ahead and take a
look this is my screen now I didn't have
to reset I didn't have to do anything I
just flashed and it took quite a while
probably not quite 10 minutes to do a
full boot before I was able to get up
and running which is not uncommon for a
first boot after doing a full flash now
it remembered all of my icon locations
where everything was which is really
really nice so I didn't have to do
anything different now
taking a look over here you'll see we've
got the same behavior on the the
resizable widgets so that's nice to have
too but did you notice this when I was
swiping here everything is just so
smooth and fluid really quite impressive
how fast that was let's go ahead and
open up a calendar here in fact I'm
gonna use my calendar icon there now
this is also very smooth very fluid and
it kind of shows you what I was
referring to where we have the view and
then a fragment over there for a list in
this case the list is a date picker so
we can come over here and look at my
week addenda see how that is just flip
through the weeks just really really
fast month the same thing except this
goes up so we can get through that
quickly the agenda we can just fly
through that really really quick so
really cool I like it quite a bit
contacts is new as well so here's my
contacts I've got all of my groups over
here my favorites over there just really
fast the way that things work here's a
lot smoother I mean you've just got to
play with this - to see exactly what I'm
talking about so let's go ahead and go
into what we can do here just like with
Ice Cream Sandwich on a smart phone long
pressing on the desktop only lets you do
wallpaper like stuff so here we can
choose from the Galleria the live
wallpapers a perfect viewer which is an
app that I have installed and wallpapers
in general so I like what I've got which
is a live wallpaper this is beautiful
weather by the way by the makers of
beautiful widgets which is what these
two widgets is same ad same developer
but let's go ahead and take a look in
here and see what we can do let's get
over to a screen that has some space on
it you'll notice now when we go into
apps we have apps and we have widgets
okay and notice how smooth this this is
I mean I can just flip throw the pose as
fast as I possibly can it's really nice
it's really quick let's say we want to
do some stuff with videos let's make a
videos group so I'm gonna go ahead and
grab the MX video player I'm gonna drop
that right there I'm gonna go back and
we're going to choose YouTube we'll drop
that right there and make a folder or a
group we'll do the videos app will do XD
a TV just like that and we'll go ahead
and add we'll go ahead and add Netflix
into that as well so now we can open
this up we can give it a name and just
like with Ice Cream Sandwich we have
these nice little tutorials that are
they kind of get in your way if you know
what you're doing but if this is the
first time that you're using Ice Cream
Sandwich it's kind of nice to show you
what you can do so I'm gonna name this
folder watching just like that and it's
named there we go I can now position
this wherever I want and I can get rid
of this however I get rid of it I don't
know how to get rid of it over here live
on the screen but anyway you can see
what we're talking about very quick very
easy very smooth and fluid I'm really
really impressed with the the way this
is now I've never been able to get
quadrant to run on the zoom I don't know
why but I want you to see this and it's
it blew my socks off the the boring part
is up here at the front while it runs
through this stuff but the part that I
like is the planet so you know what I'm
talking about where you've got the moon
going in from the planet well it's
really really slow on the zoom running
honeycomb at least running honeycomb 3.2
which is why I had the most experience
with on this device now over here if I
can get this to run and like I said this
this is not a tablet based benchmarking
utility but sometimes you can get it to
do more stuff than others but you'll
notice just how smooth and fluid this is
coming through here we're at about 20
frames per second 22 a little bit of a
graphic anomaly and some missing stuff
in there that's supposed to have rings
that goes up and down this is what was
really telling just smooth fluid crisp
or getting
above 40 frames per second over here
this is very resource-intensive we're
still getting about 30 frames per second
on that just overall really really
really nice and this time we got a
result back benchmarking it just shy of
1700 points which isn't tremendous but
you guys know as well as I do benchmarks
aren't always telling of the true
performance but overall I'm really
impressed you know of course we've got
our our menu button down here at the
bottom as well this is what tablets are
supposed to be an Ice Cream Sandwich
runs every bit as good on tablets as it
does on smartphones in fact I'd be
willing to go out on the limb and say it
runs even better on tablets than it does
on smartphones really kind of neat
showing off Ice Cream Sandwich running
on the Motorola Xoom 4 pocket now I'm
