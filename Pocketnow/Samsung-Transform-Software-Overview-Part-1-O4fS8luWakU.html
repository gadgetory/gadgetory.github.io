now calm so far you've seen us unbox the
samsung transform with sprint well now
we're actually on jump into a quick
software overview in part one we're
basically going to show you some of the
different tweaks that sprint has done
the device to actually make the device
yours and make it easier to actually
jump into the smartphone world if this
is your first smartphone device so let's
get started all right in we're back and
jumping into some of the software that
sprint has actually incorporated on to
this device the samsung transform one
very unique thing that sprint is
included here is called sprint ID now at
first glance this is a type of device
that will actually bridge the gap from a
normal cell phone user to having a
smartphone the reason being is what
they've done is they've actually created
a very simple setup process for the
Android operating system now the
open-ended opportunities with Android in
terms of the customization the different
apps you can add are a great opportunity
for many of us but for some people they
find it overwhelming now what's Sprint
ID does actually this little application
is little icon here it opens up
different profiles that you can use so
as you can see we have the standard
sprint one already set up we have my
very own it's just a custom one that
comes on there it's just a blank slate
and then you can of course add get new
sprint nighties and I what this is
basically going to do is take care of
adding all the widgets for you adding
all the different screens so as you can
see here this is the main screen what
we've actually done is added the what
weather and talk flip clock and our own
little shortcuts here but what Sprint ID
has done scrolling over to the right
you'll actually see that they bring the
sprint TV widget right there for you as
well as all of these different icons
these were actually already pre-loaded
in terms of the TeleNav GPS which is the
sprint navigation you have your sprint
football coverage there you have the
NASCAR coverage you have the family
locator ESP and again these are all
shortcuts that sprint has already taken
care of adding for you so this makes
life a lot easier because you can get up
and going right away you can press the
Facebook app there it actually won't
bring into the application we're
actually bring it to the website if
actually just press right here this will
open up the browser and it will bring
you right to the facebook website as you
can see here now it's automatic a little
the mobile version of Facebook for your
viewing pleasure so that makes life a
lot easier because you can actually get
through things now if you are brand new
user to Android especially this is
actually your first smartphone now you
will have the ability for five home
screens so actually scrolling back to
the left to our Center home screen once
again this is the one that we've
customized ourselves going over to the
left one rice you're going to have the
messaging widget so it will show you
your messages there you can reply to a
message right on the screen itself it
will give you some icons down here for
you know music camera browser in the
market as well and then one more this is
actually the very cool one we have
what's called the sprint zone so it will
basically give you shortcuts to my
account if you press that you can also
press find a store that sort of thing
but it will give you kind of a toggle
for Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth airplane mode so
i can actually press bluetooth on and
it's that simple you'll actually see the
icon pop up there once it actually
powers there we go power is the actual
Bluetooth chip on itself so this really
is going to make your transition to a
smartphone even just to an android phone
let's say you've been a user of a
different phone before you know whether
it be a knife on a blackberry whatever
it maybe even a nokia device and you're
switching to an android device now and
you're you know not looking to kind of
jump in over your head this will be a
good option for you because the Sprint
ID will actually set things up and to
actually demonstrate that I'm actually
going to press the ID here and just go
to the custom one that they call my ID
now this has not been touched at all we
have not loaded any kind of widgets on
here now one thing you're going to
notice it's a little slow to load so far
the experience hasn't been the snappiest
it hasn't been painful either though now
as you'll see it's the standard
background and it keeps giving us that
error there about the widgets so
standard background and actually give
you some directions in terms of swiping
to the left and right you'll have your
google search toolbar so same idea we're
going to have the five home screens here
but these are now completely blank so
you can start from scratch change your
wallpaper or whatever it may be so you
can use the Sprint ID and just customize
that as usually as you see fit of course
but once again that's the kind of make
your experience a little bit better in
terms of easing that transition this way
though you can change things as you see
fit now one of the really nice things is
you do have the phone button there the
actual dedicated phone button you can
bring up which reminds us
froyo how they have that launcher and
for sure there's no browser button
built-in now this is running Android 2.1
and to actually show that we're going to
go right to the settings and go to the
about phone section to show you so
they've actually kind of tweaked the UI
a little bit to give you a different
experience there now the nice thing is
it doesn't have the TouchWiz UI which
most people aren't a fan of so if you
don't like TouchWiz this could be a good
option for you as you see here we have
2.1 for the firmware the advantage of
already being on 2.1 right out of the
box means that most of the applications
in the market if not all are already
compatible with your device if you were
to pick up a android device that has
let's say 1.6 on there right now for the
current version you would be behind you
wouldn't be able to actually access a
lot of the current market applications
such as the official twitter app so
that's always a great thing to be up to
date if not ahead right out of the box
now it doesn't include Froyo as we've
stated but 2.1 keeps it somewhat close
so this has been our brief software
overview part 1 and part 2 we're
actually going to compare the samsung
transform which you see right here to a
samsung epic 4g which are both sprint
devices we're going to compare actually
opening up some of the different
applications such as Facebook the
Twitter applications Google Maps the
browser that's a big thing doing actual
browser test so actually going to test
both those out with the Wi-Fi network
now we're also going to compare that to
the epic 4g for the hardware overview as
well so we're actually going to go into
detail of the hardware of this device
here and we'll finish that off by
comparing it to the hardware of its big
brother the samsung epic 4g so as always
thank you very much for watching
everyone please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it and leave any
comments that you see fit thanks
