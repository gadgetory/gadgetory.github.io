galaxy devices offer something for
everyone and when the limited data
package is on Sprint you're backed up by
a network that lets you use samsung
galaxy phones as they were intended with
no metering throttling or overages while
on the sprint network as users we're all
different though some of us want great
gaming experiences with a big beautiful
display and a powerful CPU some want the
best possible email experience and some
just want an elegant tool for daily
phone calls and text messages the
question is which one is right for you
is the galaxy s3 or future daily driver
or is it really too much for your needs
in a more budget-friendly option like
the galaxy s2 or Galaxy victory will
suffice so allow us to make this easy
for you I'm hai meri beta this is pocket
now and this is our Samsung Galaxy
comparison on sprint
ever since the first galaxy s samsung
has proven to clearly understand
designed it doesn't matter which galaxy
variant you choose then and light will
be included in the box along with your
ability to expand everything from
external storage to a replaceable
battery their size is similar and
they're durable build quality means that
you can live with less worried of
marring the device with daily use on
paper though the specs do show their
significant differences the galaxy s3 is
the more powerful younger brother
sporting a dual-core Qualcomm s4 CPU
with two gigabytes of RAM that pushes
today's technology to the limit the
galaxy s2 is not so far out though
sporting a spirited dual-core exit 0 cpu
with one gigabyte of ram that still
today proves to be current and capable
and then we've got the Galaxy victory
which is the most budget-friendly galaxy
smartphone on sprint without skimping on
power though thanks to its dual core
Qualcomm s4 light CPU with one gigabyte
of RAM and once you test these phones
side-by-side it's clear that no matter
which device you pick they are all very
capable products where you'll see the
main differences in their displays each
display provides saturated color and
deep blacks but they are each different
the galaxy s3 uses Samsung Super AMOLED
HD panel powering 720p resolution on a
generous 4.8 inch display the galaxy s2
is a different animal sporting Samsung
super amoled plus technology surely wvga
resolution isn't as dense as the 720p
panel on the galaxy s3 but it uses the
RGB pixel matrix that's more accurate
when it comes to color reproduction and
believe it or not it's hard to see
pixels on it even with the smaller pixel
density additionally the 4.3 inch
display on the galaxy s2 makes it more
adequate for one-handed usability the
Galaxy victory on the other hand is the
more budget-minded of the three sporting
a TFT wvga display that also provides
fantastic color and contrast now
software is the different story that
makes these devices stand apart from any
other offering on sprint each of these
devices runs a specific version of
Samsung's TouchWiz user interface that's
specifically tailored to its hardware
capabilities as a result don't expect to
tell the difference between any of these
devices here what they do they do well
lag is rarely ever seen when flipping
through applications and it just proves
why Samsung is king and providing the
best processors in the mobile industry
if you're replacing any older Android
phone you'll notice a night and day
difference of upgrading to a new sprint
galaxy phone both the Galaxy victory in
the galaxy s2 are current with Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich providing a range
of enhancements to the Android user
experience such as face to unlock a new
cleaner system font and improve browsing
experience among other things on the
galaxy s3 though you'll be getting the
latest version of Android 4.1 jelly bean
which provides new and unique features
like Google now which is the future of
search on mobile devices and once you
add Sprint's 4G LTE network capabilities
your experience is fast and fluid speedo
sprint the carrier is running a variety
of great BOGO deals that come in handy
when buying phones or friends and family
you can see more information at
sprint.com / holiday but in a nutshell
you can buy any of these three galaxy
phones and get the second one for free
the deal ends soon and it's available
for both new customers and upgrading I
just advising you move quick while
supplies last now when it comes to the
overall user experience thanks very and
here's where you have to choose what's
right for you all three devices run on
Sprint's 4G network but only the galaxy
s3 and the victory run on Sprint's new
4G LTE network while the galaxy s2
remains on sprint's 4g wimax network
each device handles all the networks
well depending on your coverage and
incredibly Samsung has managed to
provide a full day of battery life on
each now that doesn't change the fact
that your mileage may vary depending on
what you do most with your smartphone
the galaxy s3 is the Beast of the pack
it's the fastest of the three in the
most fluid of the three and the most
future-proof device when you compare the
three when it comes to software upgrades
it's also the most media-centric device
with a larger screen the camera excels
by taking gorgeous 8 megapixel photos
that are in the opinion of many the best
photos taken by an Android phone to date
now the difference with the galaxy s2 is
minor it's almost as fast as the galaxy
s3 has a decent screen size which is not
too large and not too small
the camera is also quite good providing
accurate color and respectable
performance in most scenarios the galaxy
s2 is also remarkably thin and light
which you'll appreciate if you use your
phone a lot and the Galaxy victory which
even though with lesser specs this
proved to be a good contender it's the
smallest of the Sprint Galaxy phones and
thus has a better feel in the pocket and
in the hand and when it comes to
photographs it may not be the best of
the pack but it does provide these in
photography and video recording so
bottom line which of these galaxy
smartphones fits your needs it's kind of
hard to declare a winner because clearly
the galaxy s3 would take the cake until
you can pair them with a price tag if
you're in the market for a cheaper
galaxy s phone that's not as expensive
as the 199 galaxy s3 there are some
really great options and spreads so
let's break them down depending on who
they fit best the Galaxy victory is what
we'd like to call a team machine or a
starter smartphone it won't put a hole
in your wallet and would also be a
device any teen or first-time smartphone
buyer would love to show off it's got
the design elements that make a galaxy
phone a galaxy phone and is also
powerful enough to keep any teenager
playing a game or listening to music
during the day the galaxy s2 is our
example of a phone for the business
minded it's not too big not too small
and it's no slouch when compared to even
the hottest of Android competitors it's
sharper curves give it more of a serious
design that proves you mean business and
it's lightweight makes it perfect for
somebody that hits email or SMS all day
and to that the fact that sprint's 4g
wimax network is nearly available in
every major city and this is more of a
business phone when it comes to
reliability and speed for a 4G network
and finally the galaxy s3 the ultimate
power house for those that want the best
video and gaming experience if your wad
can spare it there is no way around how
good this phone is it's a powerful
device for day-to-day use life for all
day email and an awesome media machine
with its four point eight inch display
it's also the most future proof of the
three since it's samsung's current
flagship device Samsung has figured out
a way to make this device a style
statement so yeah if you get this phone
you'll be using the new galaxies as a
lot of my friends
like to say so the choice is yours I'm
sure you'll be served just fine
