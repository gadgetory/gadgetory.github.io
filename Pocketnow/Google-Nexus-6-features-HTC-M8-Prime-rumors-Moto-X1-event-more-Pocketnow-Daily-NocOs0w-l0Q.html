have begun to get leaked remorse point
to an HTC m8 Prime in the works and if
you're interested in the oneplus one
we've got the launch details which are
kind of odd I'm high memory that I and
one extra degree of temperature in this
room and this camera won't make it let's
try this is the hot version of the
pocket now daily let's begin today with
the official news as Motorola has just
announced an event to happen in London
on May thirteenth and apparently we are
expecting an affordable phone to happen
at this event but given the fact that a
lot of the phones immoral has launched
lately are affordable the question is
exactly what are we getting could we be
getting the Moto e or the moto g LT
variant or the Ferrari variant that was
talked about other rumors point that we
might get the Moto X plus 1 which is the
future Moto X that's apparently going to
be in leather and also have moto maker
and stuff like that so cross your
fingers that's what we get and speaking
of launch events those of you interested
in the LG g3 apparently there will be an
event on May 27th or this film to be
launched great and apparently we aren't
getting the g watch at the same events
which makes sense since samsung is doing
the same thing launching its wearables
at the same time as it launches its
phone so it's great a lot of leaks on
the g3 a lot of really interesting
renders and photos apparently the design
will be compelling so stay tuned this is
one of the phones that I'm personally
interested on and if you thought that
Samsung was the only company working on
a prime version of its flagship phone
HTC is now rumored to bring us an HTC
One m8 Prime and I need to catch my
breath after that at Lisa's the tipping
that apparently this phone will happen
soon the question is exactly what are we
getting from this prime variant could we
be getting the camera that we're not
getting on the current one aside from
that we get rumors that the HTC One m8
mini is also when the works let me
breathe and apparently this phone will
not bring the dual camera interesting
let's see what we get now speaking of
interesting phones apparently even
though we were talking about Android
silver yesterday there are rumors that
Google is still work
on a nexus 6 for this year as Android
silver happens next year apparently this
stone will have a lot of flagship
features but interesting one of the
biggest ones is the fact that it will
include a fingerprint scanner and it's
really hard to tell exactly why but we
do know that Google wants to push
payments with the fingerprint scanning
technology as it does make a lot of
sense though obviously it will take some
time as we know that Apple figured it
out when it comes to sensitivity and
then Samsung has it but they figure it
out the payment part so this is just
going to be a big mix back hopefully it
will be a reality a better reality from
google later and finally for the
complicated news of the day those of you
interested in the oneplus one man that's
gonna hurt first of all the company
hasn't built enough phones apparently
they have only built 100 for a certain
to show that they have so that's 100
phones and apparently they won't have
phones until the end of May and these
will only be the 16 gig variants and
then if you're interested in the 64 gig
variant that won't be available until
end of June and this is all invitation
only by the way you just can't walk into
a store and buy one and this will be
region based and it'll take some time
and my god that leads you to the
question of the day what do you think
about the oneplus one now because in my
particular case I mean come on one plus
I hate your name but still the Nexus 5
couldn't do this because it took Google
too long to build in a phones you could
have had it this was like the
opportunity of a lifetime to launch this
phone and good quantities because people
were gonna go crazy for the price tag it
was a no-brainer and now you don't have
enough phones I'm disappointed what
about you guys are you disappointed
