pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to talk about my top five
must-have cannot live without Android
applications let's get to it so in this
video we're not going to cover the
built-in apps like calculator mail and
calendar because those are kind of
obvious we're also not going to cover
the apps that probably everyone has like
Twitter and Facebook because those two
are also very obvious we're going to
talk about some slightly more obscure
applications that you can find in the
android market most of which are free so
let's start off with number one and
these aren't rent in any particular
order just going through the five
applications the first one is verizon
fios DVR manager if you use verizon fios
cable service for your television you
can get this going if you have a DVR in
your apartment or your house now if
you're using comcast xfinity or another
cable service it's likely that the
company has a similar app that you can
use so let's go into this application
and yes i am recording Jersey Shore and
if you don't watch Jersey Shore you're
just not admitting it because you
probably do so what you can do here is
you get this great on-screen guide that
is already pre cached so it is really
fast performance you can flick around
scroll around it just performs very well
and if you find something that you want
to record let's say Top Chef you tap on
it it gives you a little synopsis the
cast and from here you press record show
and it records it it's very simple
furthermore if you want to record the
entire series you press record series it
sets up a recording job on your DVR
remotely so that every episode of Top
Chef will now be recorded it was really
interesting the other day the Grammys
were on sort of halfway through and I
remembered that it was on and I forgot
to record it so I took out this
application I press record on graph on
the grammys and within about two seconds
I see the little red light on the DVR
flicker on in the living room it's just
it's just amazing how instantaneous it
is and how a phone can have a connection
with your DVR wherever you are in the
world just a really cool idea that we
actually have the technology to do that
so let's move on at number two here is
just simply amazon
if you don't use the amazon app you
should amazon sells everything nowadays
and the application makes it really easy
to sort of i want to say impulse buy but
but by something within a moment's
notice when you're out and about and you
think of something you want for example
what if you need a micro USB car charger
your phone just died in your car and
you're thinking yourself if only i had a
simple micro USB car charger this
wouldn't have happened so here we have
the listings and the one on the top is
the most relevant so we can tap on it
you can already see four and a half out
of five star rating so it's got to be
pretty good right so we scroll down and
from here you don't even have to put in
your password if you have it set up with
one click you press get this item free
with the free shipping if you have
amazon prime if not it'll be a charge
but one touch and the item is on its way
to you another cool feature of the
amazon app is the barcode scanner so i'm
going to go over here to barcode and
let's say you are out of tissues and you
don't feel like going to the store to
buy more tissues well you can buy them
through amazon you don't even have to
type the name of the product what we're
going to do here is go to the bar code
scanner going to position this on the
barcode and boom it works so fast and
there we are have the exact match for
the product that i just hand tissues
pretty cool right okay so that's the
amazon app it is free another app that I
use all the time and this is because I'm
kind of obsessed with testing my
internet speed is the speedtest.net
application I'm reviewing phones I want
to know at various locations what the
speed test is going to be like and I get
kind of excited when I see big numbers
come through the application it's a
great app it's very accurate most of the
time I say most of the time because
there are some situations where it
doesn't really work that well especially
if you don't have the server set but
from here you can choose a server that
is near you and definitely you want to
get the server closest to you to get the
best results and you run the test and it
tells you your download speed your
upload speed and compare it with friends
or whatever you may want to do there's
also a results column so you can keep
track of all of these speeds that you've
gotten and you can differentiate between
cellular data and wife
I data here on your device so really
cool app speedtest.net application
really the quintessential app if you
want to to benchmark your cellular data
speed moving on the next step I want to
talk about here is words with friends
this was previously an iOS only
application what it allows you to do is
to play an ongoing game of Scrabble with
your friends on your terms and what I
mean by that is that when your friend
moves you get a notification whether
you're using an iPhone or an Android
device or an iPad that says hey it's
your turn now you don't have to move
right now you can move in an hour from
now you can move tomorrow you can move
next week it's kind of a leisurely game
of Scrabble on your own terms with your
friends and it's just a lot of fun and
it works really well that's another free
application another application here
that I want to talk about is droid
analytics Google Analytics is sort of
the tool to use to track website data so
if you have a blog or if you have some
sort of website you want to see how many
hits you get how many page views you get
this is an ideal application that hooks
seamlessly into google analytics it's
about three dollars forget what the
exact amount is these days they've been
changing the price but if you pull it up
you'll get a list of all the sites you
watch and here's an old pocket now site
that's really not doing anything anymore
it's called wm5 fixed site we launched
it in like 2005 and here you can see
basically what what the what the stats
are so pageviews visits visitors pages
per visit bounce rate and time and you
can flip through you can custom filter
just a really cool application I use it
almost every day to track website data
very very useful indeed and finally the
last application that I could not live
without is the New York Times
application I really like the new york
times I like their journalistic style
and this application allows me to keep
up to date with what the New York Times
is writing about on a daily basis you
start off in the main screen here you go
to latest news and it gives you a little
synopsis a little picture you see
something you like you can click on it
and you can also change the text size
here through the menu so you can make it
a lot smaller if you have really good
eyes and so on and so forth
just a cool application that brings
forth the New York Times coverage it is
a free application please leave a
comment and let us know your top five
apps you cannot live without we're going
to have other pocket now editors come on
and talk about their five must-have
cannot live with that apps but we really
want to know what yours are too so
please give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it and thank you very much
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
