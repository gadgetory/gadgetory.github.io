pocketnow.com if you remember last week
on pocket now we talked about the HTC
touch HD and how it will have a new
version of opera mobile with flash
support plus some other new things well
I've actually got the new version here
on my touch pro and I'm going to show it
to you I got it from XDA developers and
i'll post links on how to get it so i'm
just going to go into opera and launch
it it's not perfect it's a little bit
buggy but it does pretty well it indeed
does that flash support okay so here we
have YouTube loading and I'm just going
to click on any video here looks like a
tribute to paul newman that goes all
right here we are someone to press play
there it is sound on everything fluid a
video pretty nice and check this out
another feature of opera mobile that
will be included on the new version that
comes out soon as a zoom bar on the
bottom so i can zoom in with this or
zoom out and as you know you can double
tap columns in opera mobile and it'll
zoom in that way or you can use this new
zoom bar which is pretty convenient to
have a little bit more control over
where you zoom so it's really great that
we can finally have flash on Opera
Mobile i'll post links on pocketnow.com
on how to get this early release and how
to install and everything like that if
you want to follow us go to twitter.com

of the new stuff that we post on pocket
