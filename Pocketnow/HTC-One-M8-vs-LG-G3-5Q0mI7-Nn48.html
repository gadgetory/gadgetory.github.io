market or attention to detail makes all
the difference but which manufacturer
pays closest attention I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is the HTC One m8 versus the LG
g3 before we get started we'd like to
thank our friends over at GSM nation for
lending us a g3 for review if you'd like
a g3 to call your own the folks over at
DSM nation have pre-orders open right
now pre-order at the first link in the
description below since this is a battle
of finer details let's start with the
hardware that set these two smartphones
apart from the competition the outside
of the One m8 is easily one of its most
distinguished features love it or hate
it it's an exceptionally well-built
phone and design was clearly one of
HTC's priorities in making this year's
one handset some feel the design of last
year's m7 was prettier but we'll try to
leave the subjectivity at home plain and
simple this phone feels like it's worth
the asking price and it looks and feels
like one of the most premium handsets
money can buy that's not always the case
with high-end smartphones especially
when they're made mostly of plastic in
the past LG has been known for using
slick slimy plastics even in its
flagships the g3 is not one of those
handsets instead it also feels great in
the hand better than any LG smartphone
we can remember
despite the plastic build it feels solid
weighty and premium most importantly LG
has managed to trim an incredible amount
of bezel away it's barely there and it
makes the 5.5 inch phone feel as Michael
Fisher said with the Moto X like you're
getting away with something does the m8
feel better and more premium absolutely
but it's also a bit more difficult to
hold on to and we're constantly worried
about scratching the brushed metal but
the unique features don't end there
for instance both the One m8 and g3 come
with larger than normal speakers the g3
s loudspeaker positioned around back is
powered by a dedicated amp and it's
rated at one watt
not a first in the industry but
definitely a noteworthy feature the one
a mate of course has us dual
front-facing boomsound speakers both are
exceptionally loud especially for phones
the g3 speaker may be a hair louder but
its rear firing and definitely sounds
more muffled the m8 tends to provide a
more full sound better
mids and lows which also provides a more
immersive multimedia experience at the
other end of that multimedia experience
is the display situation the one I'm
AIT's SLCD three display measures five
inches and bears a 1080p resolution it's
easily one of the nicest smartphone
displays to date the g3 is true HD IPS
plus display diagonally is a half inch
larger but it comes with a quad HD
resolution or a density of 534 pixels
per inch compared to the 441 PPI of the
One m8 how noticeable is it barely but
it is noticeable the thing is quad HD
content is barely existent games are
going to play at 1080p great wallpapers
will be even harder to find and the
gains are minuscule at best but the g3 s
display looks fantastic even if the
black levels aren't as dark as the MAS
at certain angles the g3 s display also
washes out and it's noticeably warmer
both displays however are phenomenal
things are just as impressive on the
inside for both phones both are powered
by the Snapdragon 801 SOC though the g3
s quad-core Krait 400 CPU is clocked at
2.5 gigahertz while the inmates is
clocked at 2.3 the m8 has two gigabytes
of RAM to the g3 s three gigabytes both
come with 16 gigabytes of storage though
the m8 has a 32 gigabyte version and
both have 128 gigabyte microSD card
sport and the m8 has a 2600 milliamp
hour integrated battery to the g3 s 3000
milliamp hour removable battery around
back the g3 has a 13 megapixel optically
stabilized sensor or the m8 has just 4.1
megapixels to work with in its duo
camera setup connectivity options are
virtually identical as well infrared NFC
Wi-Fi 802 an se and LTE however we must
note that this is the Korean model of
the g3 so you may or may not get LTE
with your GSM carrier we've been stuck
on t-mobile 3G here in the Charlotte
metro area for the duration of our time
with the g3 to summarize both of these
smartphones are supremely high-end with
gorgeous displays loudspeakers solid
construction and beautiful designs on
the hardware front it's difficult to go
wrong with either the g3 or the m8
software is a similar story both LG and
HTC took the last year to change the
appearance of their custom strains of
Android atop Android 4.4.2 kitkat both
flattened various UI elements simplified
some settings and added utility LG
software certainly comes with a more
full utility belt
things like qslide apps allow the user
to access various limited tasks without
ever leaving the current application and
dual window mode gives users a limited
split-screen functionality if you spend
enough time tinkering and tweaking
settings you'll find some cool stuff
like the ability to add a shortcut key
to cue memo plus or the notification
shade in the navigation part or change
the system font we must admit we
certainly like the appearance of LG's
new software especially how clean it
looks for how LG makes better use of the
home screen real estate but the heavy
customization options come with baggage
in the form of an overbearing density of
options and the tabbed interface of the
Settings app and some things just don't
make sense like the task switching menu
which is still a bit disorienting HTC
software is definitely more vanilla
blinkfeed is one of those love or hate
features aside from the appearance of a
few menus and the colors it's a lot like
the stock Android experience there's no
true split-screen multitasking there are
no native floating apps and the Settings
app is definitely more digestible it
makes for a more boring yet simple
experience which depending on your level
of expertise may be a good or bad thing
neither version of software immediately
turns us off which should say a lot that
said a middle ground of since 6 and the
g3 software would be a nice balance of
everything performance is as expected
great on both handsets the quad HD
resolution doesn't seem to affect the g3
performance and both handsets zip
through standard tasks and even
graphically intense gaming side by side
you may notice the occasional difference
in speed switching apps load times pinch
zooming in the browser etc but to harp
on these minor differences is to nitpick
both handsets are impressive performance
machines as their synthetic benchmark
scores will corroborate comparing
battery life and network performance
between these two models is both futile
and flawed we're testing the Korean
model of the g3 meaning it isn't
optimized for networks here in the US
we've been stuck on t-mobile 3G for the
duration of a review period and battery
life
already had its ups and downs we were
able however to reach upwards of four
hours of screen on time with the g3 and
the One m8 battery life has usually
netted us a full day of usage though on
heavier days we typically need some
juice in the late afternoon especially
to make it well into the night we will
give the g3 points for being able to
swap batteries on the fly and feature
mini have come to love in light of
modern day smartphone battery life the
cameras of these two smartphones are of
great focus but for rather different
reasons
HTC put a lot of effort into image
sensing on the One m8 LG is d3 has
optical image stabilization and laser
autofocus surprisingly it isn't the
landside victory we were hoping for and
great lighting both take great pictures
with plenty of detail though the g3
provides significantly more data to work
with for cropping and post both also
tend to boost saturation making photos
look more lively though somewhat surreal
and because g3 has oh is we expected
low-light performance to be better than
it was
instead low-light images are extremely
soft and look like oil paintings the one
image dual camera is a nice parlor trick
but it also comes with a lot of problems
for more information on that check out
our video review of the one m8 in short
the g3 s images often appeared more true
to life and the laser autofocus helped
lock onto subjects in the blink of an
eye the EM aids images had better
contrast and weren't so prone to
overexposing
but neither camera blew us away in this
comparison at the end of the day both of
these smartphones are incredible their
tip for tat and aside from the camera
experience neither phone has a glaring
flaw the user experience performance and
hardware are all top-notch but we can
break it down this way if you're after
an over-the-top foam that has it all the
g3 will not disappoint the quad HD
display 3 gigabytes of RAM and removable
battery all come together to make it a
superior foam on paper but if you're a
multimedia nut or after a phone that
feels nicer in the hand the One m8 is a
sure shot the boom sound speakers in
higher contrast of the display boost its
multimedia experience we must note that
the One m8 is a little cheaper and
easier to come by right now with carrier
subsidies but you can pre-order the g3
through GSM nation so it's not exactly
impossible to get your hands on either
whichever phone you choose we're
confident that you can
go wrong folks thanks for watching this
