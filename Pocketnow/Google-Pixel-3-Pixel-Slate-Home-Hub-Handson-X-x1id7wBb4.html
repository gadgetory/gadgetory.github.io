things with its hardware and proof is
absolutely everything that we saw in
today's event we were just thinking of
getting a couple of leet pixels but it
turns out that we got a lot more I'm
high metal even with pocket now and
let's go hands on the new Google pixel
threes the Google Home Hub and the pixel
slate Google spends a great deal of time
telling us about its approach how
devices have to focus on being your own
personal Google that your security is
crucial and the digital well being is a
top priority and we've seen a ton of
these changes in Android pie let's begin
today with the Google home hub the
company really wants to eliminate how
convoluted of this to communicate with
all these IOT devices at one time the
Google home hub is a solution reimagined
it's actually way smaller than it seems
there are four color options there's no
camera because security is a priority
and it's special ambient EQ helps it not
be intrusive when the lights go out
there are key experiences focused on the
kitchen the living room your bedroom
where the hub provides tailored
solutions to help you find the recipe
control your home and I love how it can
give you a full briefing of your day
every morning yes there is voice matched
parental controls it also controls
devices for up to 1000 brands and
there's a cool swipe down to access all
these IOT devices at one time YouTube is
also well adapted to Home Hub as it is
one of its key features let's just call
this the evolution of the Google home as
for 149 bucks I call this a steal now I
was really impressed by the new pixel
slate it's not trying to be a laptop or
a tablet but instead a good solution to
blend both it comes in a midnight blue
color that's actually quite prone to
fingerprints Google also claims that it
worked hard on enhancing its center of
gravity in order to make it easy to
handle as a tablet we have a 12 point 3
inch LCD at 3000 by 2,000 pixels at
Voronin it's of brightness which google
claims to have worked hard and tuning
with new technologies they mentioned
tucked inside we have choices for an
Intel Celeron or an eighth generation
Intel Core M 3 i5 or i7 that determines
if you're getting four eight or 16
gigabytes of RAM there's also a 48 watt
hour battery to eight megapixel cameras
one being wider for video calls there's
an all-new Chrome OS now meant to be
used with your hands and which also
allows Linux applications developer
tools split-screen productivity machine
learning to help the launcher be smarter
family controls etc but signature
feature is this keyboard in case you
want to turn it into more of a laptop it
is a backlit it takes cues from the
pixel book and how well it feels when
you type you can also use the folio
design in different angles best of all
this is a full-blown Chrome browser from
a desktop meaning there is no compromise
in the experience pricing begins a
little steep at $5.99 with the keyboard
being an extra $200 and then the pixel
pen for another 100 yeah not cheap and
finally the star of the show or should I
say the notch of the show meet the
Google pixel 3 and pixel 3 excel let's
just say that I'm holding everything
that we saw in the leaks and rumors and
you know what I'm kind of changing my
mind about my complaints it actually
looks better in real life than what we
saw in the leaks there's a two-tone
glass finish made possible by a new
edging process colors go from just black
to clearly white to not pink
lol I love that one it's for a new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor 4 gigs
of ram 64 or 128 gigs of non-expandable
storage batteries that vary depending on
the size 29 15 or 30 for 30 milli amp
hours with qi wireless charging and a
fast 18 watt adapter in the box along
with ip68 water and dust resistance
screens also vary depending on the
variant 5.5 inches without a notch or
6.3 inches with a notch both sporting
OLED technology and HDR support
there's also dual firing speakers in
order to assist with content consumption
we see the most important feature are
the cameras now with a single firing 12
megapixel shooter at the back @f 1.8
aperture and 1.4 microns and then dual 8
megapixel cameras at the front 1 regular
and 1 wide we have enhancements like
pixel core HDR plus a new top shot which
helps you avoid those bad moments by
helping the phone choose the best shot
there's even a super resume that takes
various photos in order to help you get
lossless zoom whenever you need to get
closer in a shot we'll also see a night
sight feature next month helping you
avoid the need for flash and dim LED
scenarios and for those of you asking
why two cameras at the front it's for
group selfies which brings one hundred
eighty four percent more field of view
than the iPhone 10s though tons of
phones have better field of view than
that phone it comes in two sizes the
Google pixel 3 in Google pixel 3 XL but
this clearly white model being a
nightmare to shoot but also my favorite
finish honestly it feels and looks like
ceramic pricing starts at $7.99 for the
smaller variant and $8.99 for the larger
one so yes this is the made by Google

begun let us know in the comments what
