and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview alright this time we're in
the car and we got the new maps program
for windows phone mango this is a
preview and looks pretty much the same
but there's some new features and
there's new button down there we still
have the satellite view automatic new
button is for scout and we have
directions means search is there now and
we also have a new favorite places did I
press it
so this is where you can save favorites
favorite locations and that's really
nice to have because they'll always show
up on the map and you can see them
whenever you're searching for other
things as well it doesn't seem to sync
with your windows live ID so I don't
think they're accessible from the
desktop that would be a good feature
it's also a recent listing there and
let's try the directions right down here
I have settings I read directions
allowed when tapping so it's not really
turn by turn but you'll see how that
works let's find someplace to go first
here's the location scout
and how about the pizza place so I'm
going to do directions from my location
and just like before it's going to
calculate directions but now kind of a
bigger design and if I just touch the
screen turn right onto roxbury dr west
and then immediately turn right onto
remsen road then prepare to make a right
it's going to tell me the instructions
for my next turn and maybe a couple
other new turns so I'm going to start
driving and see how this works and
you're going to see it here we go
you've gone a different way tap anywhere
to get new directions so it didn't tell
me which way to go when it was supposed
to turn but it told me that I went a
wrong way getting directions to cart
roxbury dr west toward Croydon road then
turn left onto crowing road
depart roxbury dr west toward Croydon
road then turn left onto Croydon you've
gone a different way to have anywhere to
get new directions getting directions
getting directions turn right onto
remsen road and then immediately turn
right onto Regent place and prepare to
make a right
okay it's going to tell me go right and
if I make correct turn it should make a
different noise there's the correct turn
noise so you can go along and you'll
know when you made the correct turn and
if you uh kind of forgot where you go
and you can just capture straight to
roxbury dr west then turn left onto
route 100 north / Central Park Avenue so
it's not totally hands-free but you
don't really have to look at this I can
just feel the phone tap it anywhere
roxbury dr west and turn left onto route
100 north / Central Park Avenue and it's
going to tell me where to go so it's not
great but it's usable as a turn by turn
directions I don't know why they require
you to do the tap-in screen in order to
hear directions but that's the way it is
so there you go usable let's get back
out here and not too bad actually so be
sure to check out Pacquiao calm for our
full preview of windows phone mango
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
