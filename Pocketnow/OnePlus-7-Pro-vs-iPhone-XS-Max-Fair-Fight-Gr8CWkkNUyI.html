of bang for buck devices in Android
today finding itself among the flagship
elite despite not having typical
flagship prices and even with its little
quarks the solid day to day experience
is plenty for the multitudes of the
oneplus faithful but does the never
settle model ring true when the phone is
pitted against the biggest Apple
competitor this is PocketNow and I'm
Josh Megara what's going on everybody
let's find out the answer to that
question in this comparison between the
1 plus 7 Pro and the iPhone 10s max
there's no getting around it both of
these phones are big there's a lot of
screen to go around to be sure but both
of these phones are dancing around the
6.5 inch display range as such the
footprints are also really similar with
the phones pushing and for some people
blasting past the comfort level needed
for one-handed usage the oneplus Evan
pearl makes handling a bit tougher by
curving the screen so ease of use gets
knocked down a peg because of this but
it's pretty easy to forgive the phone
for all of this when the screen is this
good a 90 Hertz refresh rate makes
oxygen OS just glide underneath the
finger and the higher resolution is a
welcomed new step for a oneplus in
general you need no better example of
smart phone design evolution than these
two phones right here while the screen
of the iPhone is still a good looker it
is already antiquated compared to many
phones I came after it because they
discovered ways of removing the notch
like many users I got used to this
cutout pretty easily but comparisons
like this are what cause phone Envy
let's put aside for a second the fact
that the front facing camera isn't a
cool motorized pop-up on the 1 + 7 Pro
instead just look at the near bezel is
quad HD AMOLED display here's to hoping
that the next iPhone finds a way to give
this kind of display experience going
around the frames the iPhone might have
a silent toggle but then again there's
the oneplus alert slider there are no
headphone jacks for either phone but
both companies do have their own
wireless headphone solutions external
sound favors the 1 + 7 Pro whose dual
speaker setup is above average and the
battery in the 1 + 7 Pro is large at
4000 milliamp hour units which is almost
1000 / that found in the iPhone 10s max
however the longevity of the 1 + 7 Pro
gets taken down a little bit by the high
refresh rate and the high resolution of
the screen luckily though the 1 + 7 Pro
can be charged up really easily using
warp chargers which are conveniently
included in the box that's not the case
for the iPhone 10s Mac's even though it
does have wireless charge
alright that brings us to the cameras
which is a matter of options and feature
sets honestly the quality comparison
came down to the 1 plus 7 pros 48
megapixel Sony IMX sensor that continues
to impress and pretty much any phone
that rocks it it's highly detailed
provides great stabilization in video
and is accompanied by both the zoom and
a wide-angle lens in this case along
with the pro mode for manual controls
the 7 pro simply gives users more to
work with
while updates are still rolling in to
improve camera quality since its initial
release the only real bummer is as of
right now are that the wide-angle lens
is a bit soft in the edges and only the
Sony sensor is used in video recording
Diophantus max on the other hand brings
dual 12 megapixel shooters for robust
portrait shooting options and smart HDR
capabilities to be honest photos and
videos are consistently captured well in
the iPhone making it a great
point-and-shoot solution for many
general users smart HDR can be a bit
aggressive though especially in the
shadows of photos and videos but detail
is high throughout Apple has yet to
embrace the wide-angle life but the real
omission here is a night mode that we're
starting to see in a lot of Android
phones these days selfies between these
two phones are pretty comparable and
neither phone really pulls ahead in this
particular department you do have to
decide if portrait lighting is cooler
than a pop-up camera and this pop-up
camera hasn't gotten old yet performance
isn't really something you'll envy in
either direction as iPhones are always
optimized properly for both daily user
interface operation and app usage Bay 12
ionic is backed by 4 gigabytes of RAM
and no expandable storage and
unfortunately the higher you get with
the internal storage options the further
up the price goes the 1 plus 7 pro has
oxygen OS itself a very optimized
version of Android in particular as with
any Android flagship the higher
specifications ensure that the daily
experience is top notch with the
snapdragon a 55 supporting the 7 pro
alongside up to 12 gigabytes of RAM and
storage options that can get up to 256
gigabytes without breaking the bank the
way the iPhone does gaming does favour
the 1 + 7 Pro a bit more simply because
it gives players more options there's a
gaming mode that blocks unwanted
distractions which can be done in iOS as
well but now there's a fanatic mode that
boosts performance if you've ever wanted
to do gaming content there's now a
built-in screen recorder here that
record the internal audio iOS has had
its own screen recorder for a while but
there's more control and oxygen OS over
the quality of the capture and as far as
everything else goes into user
interfaces the story is summed up pretty
simply they're both clean but the looks
are only surface level what matters most
to Apple users is the ecosystem for
example iMessage still remains one of
the biggest reasons to stick to iOS and
a lot of you talk about it in the
comments especially when it comes to
group messaging airdrop kind of doesn't
have a true equivalent in Android yet
and as Apple makes bigger and bigger
moves towards their services
interconnectivity between these devices
Mac OS and now the new iPad OS devices
will be appreciated by those who go
all-in on the Apple stuff those
functions are not lost on the oneplus
fan but they're a bit harder to come by
due to the fragmented nature of Android
but the story of oneplus is software is
about how it takes Android and makes it
simple and clean them oxygen OS has
actually had some features that are now
getting into iOS 13 just announced at
WWDC for example the dark mode and of
course Android is more customizable than
iOS but oxygen keeps those options
simple yet significant right down to a 1
plus slate font as is always the case
with these Android versus iOS
comparisons your choice is gonna come
down to your needs oxygen OS cleanly
delivers the possibilities of Android
while iOS is just one layer to an
ecosystem that rewards users for willing
to bite more and more of the app a quick
shout-out to the sponsor of this video
the brave browser now I've been using
the brave browser on my desktop for
quite a while now and I've been able to
block so many different ads and trackers
thanks to the brave shields but now it
also rewards you with bat or be 80
tokens when you look at targeted ads and
by looking at some of those ads you
obtain cryptocurrency that you can use
to paid forward to your favorite
creators and also websites across the
internet that you want to support
directly to find out more information
about the brave browser its shield and
the bat tokens you can look at the link
that is found in the description down
below and so there you have it a look at
two of the biggest phones kind of
literally and figuratively
in Android and iOS you may be put off by
the high price of the Apple device
especially at higher storage capacities
but if you have your eyes on the latest
iOS smartphone you might already be far
into the Apple ecosystem to begin with
one plus is getting better and better
each year this year making a phone that
provides a lot without too many
sacrifices and it certainly gets closer
to the cleanliness experience that Apple
users have enjoyed in their camp thus
far all right it's time to ask which one
you would pick into the comment sections
down below and let us know which one of
these large phones you might end up
picking and let us know why as well drop
some likes on this video so we know you
like what we're doing here at pocket now

haven't already I'm gonna go ahead and
call it on this one thank you so much
