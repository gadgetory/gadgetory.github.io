another convertible laptop and even the
branding would lead you to believe that
this is another iteration of the HP Envy
series but it's not oh it is definitely
not I'm high metal even with PocketNow
reporting from the snapdragon Tech
Summit in Hawaii and let's talk about
the always connected PC with this new HP
Envy x2 and the assertion ov ago today
sees the birth of a new category of
computer the always connected PC is a
full-blown Windows 10 computer that's
now powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 this means a couple of significant
things that make these computers stand
apart from a standard PC first of all as
the name States these computers are
always connected thanks to the
technology provided by the Snapdragon
835 processor because it's like if you
were using a cell phone processor here
second is that it's an extremely
powerful fish and computer once again
thanks to all the mobile technology
provided by the Snapdragon 835 it
doesn't really matter if it's the HP
Envy x2 or the issue Sonova go you're
getting 20 plus hours of battery life
third is the non compromised experience
believe it or not the 10 nanometer
process on the Snapdragon 835 is
powerful enough to run Windows 10 and
for those of you worrying about
applications x86 apps run just fine
through emulation and it doesn't really
matter if you've got Windows 10 S or
Windows 10 Pro it'll run just fine
fourth the new HP Envy x2 is the perfect
example of how slim designs can become
it looks like a surface pro 4 from a
distance but it's far slimmer in
thickness we're talking about a machined
aluminum build that's slim and light
enough to be used like it's habit or you
can turn it into a computer thanks to
this keyboard case ports include USB C a
headphone jack micro is the expansion
and most important a SIM tray to remain
connected to the Internet
tucked inside we have the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 a gigabytes of ram 256
gigs of storage even if this computer is
set to run window
10 s you can upgrade for it to run other
versions of Windows just like a regular
PC this is also a world view camera
allowing the specie to access 3d and AR
tools in Windows 10 and yes there's
stylus support through Windows ink and
then v we have the Asuza Nova Co this
being the more laptop like model that
brings less of an inspired design but a
more conventional computer with standard
USB ports HDMI and a form factor that
can be set into tent mode laptop mode
you name it specifications are nearly
the same when compared to the env
snapdragon 835 options for 6 or 8
gigabytes of RAM 256 gigabytes of
storage and windows ink is also
supported through a stylus and there's
even a fingerprint scanner that provides
Windows hello support so for those of
you asking yourself what's the catch
literally there is no catch this is
again the future of computing as we see
it if you want to notice any sort of a
difference between how apps run on this
or a regular Windows 10 PC apps will
probably take about a second longer to
launch but after that they'll work just
fine all in all I have to say that I am
extremely impressed with these offerings
I feel at least when it comes to those
who need computing on the go this is
definitely the best option to buy
they're definitely not powerful gaming
computers but that's what other
processors and platforms will serve e4 I
mean the price tag is between six to
eight hundred dollars so definitely this
is more a mobile computer than anything
else you can bet that I personally can't
wait to give either of these computers a
try as our review units are set to
arrive very soon
well that happens chime in the comments
let us know what you think about the
always connected PC first of all do you
