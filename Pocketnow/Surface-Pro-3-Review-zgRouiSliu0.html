tablet I've ever used since I'm more
than just a tech journalist the power to
use real high-end creative programs that
have been around for decades has been
very important now I've got a surface
pro 3 and that brings a whole host of
changes to Microsoft's line of tablets
Microsoft's big point about the surface
pro 3 is that it is a tablet that can
replace your laptop for me that already
happened in 2002 but for everyone else
that remains to be seen this is Adam
Liam from pocket I'll keep watching for
our full review of the surface pro 3
we'll start with the Spence surface pro
3 is available in a greater range of
configurations the previous surface
Pro's hours as a fourth generation Core
i5 4300 u 2.5 gigahertz Haswell
processor 8 gigs of ram 256 gigs of
storage and the battery life can
generally last all day without having to
plug in it's got an Intel HD 4400 GPU as
well but the surface pro 3 is available
in other configurations that offer even
more horsepower if that's what you're
looking for in terms of hardware the
surface pro 3 steps things up
considerably the weight and dimensions
have changed significantly from previous
surface pros at 292 millimeters by 2 a
1.3 millimeters by of 9.1 millimeters
and only 800 grams the surface pro 3 is
much thinner than previous generations
it's lighter to the screen size is
bigger at 12 inches with a gorgeous 2160
by 1440 pixels resolution and a nice
paper like three by two aspect ratio of
course also has full size USB 3 port
microSD slot for storage expansion and
said Jack Wi-Fi Bluetooth and a mini
DisplayPort that can be daisy changed
for multiple monitors front and rear
cameras have been upgraded to 5
megapixels each as well but since this
is a tablet you shouldn't be using those
for anything other than video chats the
new kickstand is a significant
improvement instead of only one or two
viewing angle positions the surface pro
3 is kickstand can be adjusted for
almost any viewing angle the first angle
flips out very easily so you can set it
on a table very quickly but the hinge
becomes much different when you bend it
further define
desired angle it's a great solution and
frankly I'm very impressed with the
engineering behind it one of my favorite
parts of the new surface pro 3 is the
new screen size the larger 12 inch
screen and 3 by 2 aspiration make
professional-grade desktop programs like
those in the Adobe suite much easier to
use there's a lot more vertical space
available for all of those tools and
control panels high resolution is great
too so for some of the programs that
don't yet support high DPI screens in
those cases buttons are often way too
small the screen mainly works best
indoors though even with full brightness
turned up outdoor viewing isn't so good
Microsoft's had to make larger type
covers for the new surface pro 3 due to
the larger screen the new type covers
are still sold separately so that you
can choose the color you want or just
not get one and used some other keyboard
instead it still has the backlit keys
and a nice soft material on the back but
now there's a new trackpad because the
keyboard is bigger Microsoft was able to
make the trackpad 68 percent larger and
it's also nice smooth plastic instead of
the cloth like material the new keyboard
has an extra folding area that can
magnetically attached to the bottom
bezel of the screen without this
attached touching the screen can cause
the tablet to wobble a bit if you have a
steep angle on the kickstand and you're
setting it on your lap attaching it
makes the screen a lot more stable in
that scenario the original surface pro
and surface pro 2 both use an
inexpensive version of Wacom Cintiq
digitizer technology with the surface
pro 3 mics to switch the stylist
digitizer technology to an intrigue
version the advantages including thinner
screen less of a visual gap between the
stylus tip and pointer display and
better accuracy the surface pro 3 stylus
only supports 256 levels of pressure
sensitivity which is much less than
stars far too but in real life the
difference is not noticeable at all you
still have plenty of control over
variable brush strip with using the
stylus in all of your high-end graphics
programs now let's talk about the
software the surface pro 3 comes with
Windows 8.1 pro pre-installed this is
the only touch friendly operating system
out there that can run your
professional-grade desktop PC programs
that means you've got access to the
largest computing ecosystem in the world
more software than androids and apples
app stores combined if you're an artist
with Photoshop see brush illustrator
manga studio etc you'll want to install
the wind tap drivers from the intrigue
website in order to enable pressure
sensitivity in all of those programs
after you do that it all works just as
well as the Wacom tech and the previous
surface pros the new drawing hardware is
slightly more accurate to Windows 8.1 is
great for fullscreen consumption
applications as well you can snap up to
four Metro apps side by side on the
surface pro 3 screen and the interface
is designed to make very efficient use
of edge gestures swipe from the left
edge to swap apps swipe from the right
edge to exit important functions like
settings printing or sharing some people
may think that switching between the
desktop environment and the new touch
friendly modern interface is joined
that's kind of true but it's no more
jarring than opening the program like
the Lightwave 3d and switching between
that and Microsoft Word the surface pro
3 introduces one more extremely cool
sound or function though if the new
stylus has a proper Bluetooth connection
to the tablet you can press the purple
button on the end of the pen to launch
one note even if the tablet is in sleep
mode in our review unit this only works
some of the time but we expect some
software updates to come down the line
and prove the reliability not everything
on the surface pro 3 is an improvement
though my biggest annoyance is that the
capacitive start button is now in the
right bezel when the tablet is held in
landscape mode I've accidentally pressed
it far too many times when using the
stylus on the screen the other anoints
is that the stylus uses three
non-rechargeable batteries I've been
using it for a week now and Oswell but
I'm sure when those batteries die I will
be very annoyed using the type cover
keyboard on your lap in combination with
the kickstand might feel awkward if you
used to a bottom heavy laptop but this
isn't a laptop use the handwriting
recognition or touch screen keyboard
instead there are plenty of other
comfortable infant methods on this thing
when you're running some CPU heavy
functions or it's updating something in
the background the surface pro 3 can get
pretty hot on the back and once or twice
we've had some major slowness when we're
assuming from sleep mode those few
negative issues seem very minor compared
to all the others awesomeness in the
surface pro 3 our final radiant is going
to be
in eight point eight out of ten the
surface pro 3 loses a few points for
having batteries in the stylist and an
awkward start button in the bezel
everything else makes the surface pro 3
the best tablet PC we've ever used the
large screen and super thin body
combined with the most powerful mobile
computing hardware around make the new
surface pro 3 practically irresistible
that's it for now be sure to give this
video a thumbs up and thanks for
