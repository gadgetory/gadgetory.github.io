pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna talk about swipe pad which is a
must-have Android utility which makes a
lot faster to multitask let's get to it
now of course in Android you can
multitask by tapping and holding the
home button so let's say you're an opera
mobile and you want to get to the
multitasking menu tap in home
here's your 8 most recently used
programs this is great now but the tap
on hold is just too long for a lot of
people if you're trying to bounce in and
out of applications there's a faster way
thanks to an application called swipe
pad what it allows you to do and let's
go to an application to demonstrate this
you can swipe from the left side of the
screen the right side of the screen or
one of the corners and quickly get this
little pop-up menu which you can
configure with your own set of shortcuts
with twelve of them and the reason that
this is faster is because you don't have
to tap and hold the swiping action is
just so much faster so I can go into the
market that has to load I'm going to go
back and most of the time works
perfectly we can go into the gallery or
opera mobile and it just works very well
now we can also configure some of these
that are empty so if I tap and hold it
asks do you want to launch an
application a shortcut like a direct
dial or there's a task manager that you
can download but it's just highly
configurable it works really well and
I've been using it for a couple of days
and I've found that it's much easier to
multitask with this than it is to tap
and hold on the recent items list so
again that's called swipe path there are
some settings which I want to dive into
really quickly so we go over here
swipe pad so you can enable swipe pad
this will to determine the region from
which swipe pad will open up so you can
do the bottom edge if we do that it'll
pop up from the bottom as you can see
there I think it works very well on the
Left edge just a very natural thing to
do kind of swipe left to right kind of
like you're unlocking the screen we have
some advanced controls in here sort of
animations and things like that very
basic settings very easy to get going
again it's called swipe pad it's free in
the Android Market it's a really cool
way to multitask that's it for now
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
