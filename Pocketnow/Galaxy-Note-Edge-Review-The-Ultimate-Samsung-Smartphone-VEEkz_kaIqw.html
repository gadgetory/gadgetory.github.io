screen Android smartphone that brought a
new take on multitasking to the Galaxy S
experience four years later the company
is doing it again and this time its
phablet owners who are taking note I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our video review of the Samsung
Galaxy Note edge when we first saw the
smartphone at Aoife 2014 in September I
was less than impressed the software was
buggy and the compromises made to
accommodate the novel display meant the
fit and finish suffered in comparison
with the excellent galaxy note 4 that
last point still stands the note 4 does
boast a better in hand feel and if you
want more details on that check out our
recent comparison video standing alone
though the Note edge is more oddity than
anything else an asymmetric airplane
wing of a smart phone that's a little
awkward to pick up and a little delicate
to hold both thanks to that futuristic
curved display the curved component is
just a small part of an otherwise
excellent AMOLED screen with plenty of
pixel density terrific saturation and
contrast and the embedded Wacom
digitizer that makes the included S Pen
work the edge display dominates the
phone's entire right-hand side so the
power standby key now sits up top and
inconvenience on a phone this big
everything else though remains where you
expect it on a top tier Samsung from the
IR transmitter to the heart rate blood
oxygen sensor to the removable battery
and storage expansion bay there may be
an edge here but remember that's the
second word in the name first and
foremost this thing's a note and as such
it's a really good smart phone if you
watched our galaxy note 4 review a few
months back you already know our
feelings on the software here if you
didn't they can be easily summarized if
you don't mind waiting a while for an
update to the latest Android version and
you really want to make the most out of
an oversized display you'll be right at
home on a note
Samsung's software is neither the
prettiest nor the most consistent but it
takes better advantage of a big screen
than any other interface out there and
that goes double for the Note edge
that's thanks to the edge display which
Samsung's UI treats as a totally
different screen kind of like the old
external color ID screens on yesterday's
clamshell phones the edge display serves
as a cosmetic accessory big notification
bar handy bedside clock sports social
and stock ticker data usage meter
shortcuts panel you name it Samsung has
probably found a way to shoehorn it into
160 pixels even the ruler which I
instinctively made fun of it first came
in handy recently when a friend called
me up asking me to measure my foot to be
fitted for wedding shoes and even if
none of that ties your top ciders
Samsung has provided the api's for
developers to build their own
downloadable panels which are sparse now
but may grow if Samsung releases more
bent screen phones in the future as a
whole the edge display is definitely a
bit superfluous
but don't be too quick to dismiss it if
you really commit to using it it's very
convenient for one-handed access to your
apps and it frees up a ton of home
screen space for widgets or just a
cleaner look and it adds still another
layer to Samsung's multitasking
portfolio check it out with the edge
screen combined with multi window you
can literally watch netflix surf twitter
and keep an eye on football scores all
on the same screen and the phone doesn't
even break a sweat while you're doing it
is it comfortable or practical not in
the slightest but you can if you want to
and come to think of it that might as
well be the unofficial slogan of the
whole note family the edge smartly takes
advantage of its curved display in the
camera software which puts all the
controls above the fold of the screen
this looks great
probably better than any Samsung
viewfinder on the market but it's also
really easy to accidentally shoot
pictures especially when you're shooting
one-handed fortunately the performance
of the camera itself is just as
impressive here as on the note 4
the 16 megapixel shots feature great
rich colors and contrast smart blending
in HDR and pretty good low-light quality
thanks to optical image stabilization
unless you regularly tote a DSLR or
mirrorless camera around this is a
smartphone shooter that probably won't
leave you wishing for another by the
same token you're probably going to be
impressed by the note edges general
performance regardless of application
our AT&amp;amp;T review device gave us excellent
data speeds and average voice quality
and Greater Boston over a one week
period and testing its Snapdragon 805
with a title like sky gamblers air
supremacy was sublime even over a
nonstop half-hour of play the game
didn't stutter once the interface is
still subject to the occasional
herky-jerky responsiveness issues but as
we learned in our Nexus 6 review that's
no longer an issue confined to phones
with heavy skins still sluggishness does
tend to get worse over time rather than
better so we'll keep an eye out for how
well the note edge ages and if we're
able we'll report back in an installment
of after the buzz the final test area
battery life yielded no surprises
despite the reduction in battery size
relative to the note 4 the edge is
capable of the same 5 hours of screen on
time over a day of moderate usage that's
admirable considering the added display
activity the edge screen brings but it's
not nearly as impressive as the 6 7 even
10 hour screen on times we've seen on
similarly sized devices with lower
resolution displays
fortunately the same quick charging
we're seeing on most modern phones has
made its way here as well is the node
edge the best Galaxy Note there is not
necessarily the more conventional note 4
might be less flashy but it feels better
in the hand it's easier to use in some
ways and I think it looks better but the
Note edge is bigger in an abstract sense
it's the ultimate expression of
Samsung's phablet philosophy the Note
edge seems to say anything you can dream
of doing on a smartphone you can do with
this device and in that respect
it almost justifies its outsized price
tag
almost the Galaxy Note edge isn't for
Joe Sixpack looking for mirror utility
it's an overpowered showboat for the
futurist the feature flaunt ur or just
the Android user who truly wants it all
for an in-depth look at everything the
Note edge was built upon check out our
galaxy note 4 review here on youtube and
at pocket now linked in the description
below and check out Galaxy Note edge vs.
galaxy note 4 also here on YouTube till
next time this has been michael fisher
with pocket now captain two phones on
twitter thanks for watching I'm gonna go
take the edge off sorry that's the last
one I promise we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
