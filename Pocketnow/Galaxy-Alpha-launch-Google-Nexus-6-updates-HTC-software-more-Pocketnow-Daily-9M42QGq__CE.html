we can't understand what for new details
of the Moto 360 mention its superiority
to existing Android wear products and
the Google Nexus 6 by motorola may not
be as big as you think I'm hi I'm Adam
iveta and yes what we needed was a
metallic underdog Samsung thank you very
much this is parking a daily let's begin
today talking about HTC as the company
has just made it official that it is
segregating more of its business HTC
creative labs is now going to focus on
the company's software and they're going
to start building applications for
everybody to be able to use meaning you
will need to buy an HTC phone in order
to be able to use things like Zoe which
is the first service that's going to be
launched in the next couple of days and
you should be able to download it on
your phone eventually even if it's not
HTC now we don't know exactly what other
applications are going to be included
not sure of HTC Sense is going to be
part of that but let's see how that goes
as hopefully this will not make HTC
software division which is probably one
of the coolest parts of HTC products be
something that everybody else would have
I mean what else would HTC you to
differentiate now let's talk about
Microsoft mobile or Nokia however you
want to call it as we've got some new
reports on those only eight-thirty
thought I was were concerned apparently
this phone is going to be a verizon
exclusive but as new rumors point out it
seems that there will be three different
models of Lumia 830 that will be based
on three different carriers AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
and t-mobile the AT&amp;amp;T variant will
apparently not have wireless charging
and apparently it'll have a bigger
display when compared to the other
models though we still can't make up
what will happen with that 20.7
megapixel rear view camera hopefully
it'll make it to 3 models but yeah it
seems that there will be some spec
differences stay tuned we'll keep you
posted as microsoft's Aoife event will
tell us more one of the most anticipated
wearables of the year is the Moto 360
that we are still waiting for we know
that it's metallic it's got wireless
charging and everything but if you were
wondering what else would make this moto
360 better than the existing Android
wear products it seems a battery life
will be one of those things as reports
claim that apparently this device will
have as much as 3.5 days
of battery life when compared to one day
that you're getting on the LG G watch
that's one of the biggest issues with
Android wear is the fact that battery
life is terrible and the charging these
products is terrible as well motorola
seems to have an edge on everybody with
how things are done we just wish we had
a launch thing and it seems of the
people from gfxbench we're watching the
pocket out daily yesterday and they
heard your comments with you complaining
over the motorola shamu or Google Nexus
6 as it turns out they've updated the
page for this phone and it seems that it
will be better in some ways like for
example it seems that it will have a
Snapdragon 805 it seems that it will
have a 2k display but it seems that it
will be just the 5.2 inch 2k display and
not a 5.9 inch which is not necessarily
bad a lot of people don't want a 6-inch
phone and it's great to see that this
phone will not be a monster so stay
tuned as we get more details on the
motorola shampoo or whatever this thing
is going to be called a lot of us want
this phone and probably for the very
interesting news of the day Sam things
just announced this galaxy alpha nothing
fancy the galaxy alpha is announced it
is an italic 4.7 inch Galaxy phone that
looks a lot like the galaxy s5 but with
the metallic trim that suppose probably
gonna make it to the note lineup as well
and specification Zarn tat big yes it
does have an octa-core processor but you
don't have expandable storage even
though you do get 32 gigs which is not
bad and the rest of the things aren't
bad 12 megapixel camera elixir for full
details on specifications but that leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think about this galaxy alpha
they're calling it just alpha do you
think that this is a cool phone is it's
something that you want in my case
honestly uh no metal is not really what
I want from a galaxy phone especially in
touch was is still there but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
frenzy asst you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video was filmed she follow us on
it out I promise structure to channel as
well it also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore iveta please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw i am
home every letter thank you very much
