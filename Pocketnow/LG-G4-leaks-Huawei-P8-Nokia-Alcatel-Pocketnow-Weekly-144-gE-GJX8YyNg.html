pocketnow sent you Adam Dowd yo did you
survive that in try still awake I'm and
tell him pocketnow sent you Adam Dowd yo
did you survive that intro not true hey
tell everybody watching wiggling in my
that's not true hey tell everybody
watching what long for us to come on the
air I think they deserve some
instructions I think your watch a little
Q&amp;amp;A question in the google apps Google
Hangouts over there you just welcome to
contribute a Q&amp;amp;A question in the google
ads google hangouts bucks got over there
you just type in your question and then
other people like it they'll upload it
will get to the ones that we love and
the ones that everybody else loves and
there will be a lot of love for you oh
and i just i don't know how they're
going to have the manpower is there an
extra charge for this i didn't i didn't
see how it is not that that there will
avoid that at all costs because
wondering how that can be financially
viable then and actually that's why
right it's gonna cost him a lot of money
and it remember brevity is king for this
um and that's a good question right i'm
sure that uh i'm sure that there are
other things that give you spending
their money on but it's no doubt well
done thank you for that I'm dad filling
in for Stephen shank today he usually
tells people at this point what they
have to do to participate in the show
but he today recording at an
inconvenient unconventional time and
we're going to try not to do this again
except for next week when we do
something specific implement the only
job being to go out and deliver these
phones and all that or do you think
they're just gonna let you know slap a
cap on whether existing you know
whoever's doing the worst and sales
right now if you're like well you're the
dress today yeah I wonder about that
it'll be like like it'll turn a sprint
store into a pizza joint right yeah
you're gonna be working the counter and
Tim you're driving today all right I
don't know but they hope to get 5,000
cars out doing this delivering phones to
users you know that's pretty cool it's
almost like a tmobile boom when you so
when you think about it is talk about
the device itself but how was your time
with it it was good I you know I got out
of the box the very first thing that I
see is you know the awesome looking red
color of the phone and uh yeah I just
didn't want to put it down because of
that color in the way it feels it's
awesome so this is the device itself but
I want to know I mean you had to pull
some all-nighters to get those the phone
delivered to you within the same day or
you have to wait for you whenever they
get whenever one of the drivers gets to
you or what do you think so if it's not
the same day you might as well just you
know it offer free coconut chili right
yeah right right right but but then you
don't get the concierge service have
like the changeover something I feel
like this is gonna be like a
grandmother's are gonna are going to
want to do this maybe but then that's
kind of like kind of old-school to right
it's like and I'll just get an iphone
but this is supposed to begin in
September as a commenter rightfully
points out that's iphone release time
and um oh and then the comment devolves
into a trollee bash on iOS users of
course yeah would really go from five
thousand girls to 50,000 cars compact
 right everyone in the chat is
saying you've got some some issues with
our feed apologies apparently it's
hangouts we're we're back up here so I
don't actually know what this situation
is but everyone who's still watching
thanks our life view count just went
into the trash hangouts it's got to be
atrocious today that's your patent but
I'm son Ansem yeah if she you guys look
great to me I don't know what the
problem is on the broadcast side but you
know what we're all having a good time
and that's what matters was right Jules
is going to listen to that point when
he's at about our four or five of
editing the high quality cut together
out of all this trash and then he's
gonna throw his computer then he too
will have tech
problems listen this is it this news
feed is about to end because we're about
to get to the end of it and that's this
week in mobile history Adam doubt
favorite series to write my favorite
series to read one of those things is
true you decide which one down tell us
what happened this week in mobile
history ah this week in mobile history
is actually um it was a little bit light
well I have to admit there wasn't a
whole lot going on there were a couple
of things coming full circle though
which was kind of nice i'll start off
i'll just give you a quick rundown i
like the first story that i had i call
it a missed opportunity because packard
bell in 2002 was in that it was
introduced in its pocket pc called the
pocket gear and we reported on pocket
now and there should have been a better
headline than than what we had but it
wasn't meant to be let's see then we
have an mp3 player from brandon that he
liked from dell in 2004 all those dell
mp3 players yeah they were monster boxes
of delight yes we had a wizard versus
wizard comparison indeed slicks that
windows supplies it was a singular 8125
versus the IM 8k jam which is basically
the same in size with a differing hard
candy shells and then the one of our
fascinating pieces that i found from
2007 was a battery charger which he hath
again oh it's a battery charger Gil yeah
it's not big deal but this battery
charger ran off of double-a batteries I
am so mad at you actually put double a
batteries in this case and then plug
that into the bottom of your phone oh no
totally I saw those the other used to
sell iment that likes a 7-eleven and
stuff and convenience yeah you opened
some double a batteries and juice up
your phone right quick cuz like what was
the rating on phones back then was the
milliamp hour rating probably like 806 I
don't know six or seven no but and then
the other thing from 2007 rolled around
I that I've actually found the intro
fascinating was a windows mobile 6 of
great details from released
HTC so even back in two thousand seven
people were still asking the question am
i going to get the latest version of the
operating system so I thought that was
kind of cool um and didn't that a lot of
scanning headlines from 2000 a that came
across microsoft introduces or Microsoft
Surface arrives and I'm like what thats
how emo's not right and I opened up the
article and they're talking about the
surface table top computer which they
use in Hawaii five-o all the time but
I've never seen anywhere else and then
Adam Lane made an impassioned plea to
keep mobile web alive so one of those
two things was cool and the other one
was a fitness guided finally a 2011 HBO
GO video on demand came to iOS and
Android but I thought it was interesting
that you know this week in mobile
history four years ago HBO GO video on
demand came to iOS and then this year
right around the same time HBO's
independent online streaming services
comes to iOS so I HBO has a has a long
lasting relationship with iOS burying
the lead here dad you know what I want
you to get to uh and are we talking well
there's there's two other choices and
she's not the Mets not the one named
after the fruit not the mango okay so
first shots arrive of Angry Birds Easter
yeah I'm an angry birds was still a
thing and they had this seasonal game
game boards that they would release for
octo for halloween and labor day and
arbor day and we were excited enough to
post a lead story about Angry Birds
Easter we were really really sad back in
2011 and that and right away they
matched up this week in mobile history
if they've got some deep angry birds
game that just booked me with a 30
second ad anytime I'm playing any of my
league freemium apps on on my head
really oh no that's sucks i always pay
to get rid of the ads because i don't
like that it ruins the ruins experience
for me hey there's um you know how many
comments are on this post out
um last I checked it ended in zero they
go ball goose egg who cares about this
week in mobile history except me listen
keep writing these pieces for me and I'm
you know we'll just arrange it that way
because I like it I'm it makes me sad
that you said that because when you said
nobody cares about this week in local
history spots including me including
yeah I know it's not your favorite thing
to do but it's fun it's fine you know
it's a nice stroll back through memory
lane and actually i think if my memory
went back before 2009 this would be a
lot more fascinating for me but you know
i got in on the i got in late to the
mobile tech scene so I never had a
pocket pc that's mine that's my failing
and I understand that that's the same
time just gonna head down here when we
were talking about that Sony CLE a which
was a good time I also never watched
movies that were made before nineteen
eighty so well it's how I roll that's
alright that's you know that's neither
actually really it's time for us to help
out to do our civic duty and help out
some of our fellow smartphone sailors in
distress Jules would you please take us
into what phone should i get as parallel
mariners on the storm-tossed seas of the
smartphone world we're bound by honor
and tradition to lend a hand when their
turn comes to upgrade join us in the Q&amp;amp;A
section as we try to help out Burt
cocaine till the best thing I've ever
Lakota we in wrapper and Andrew burgess
as they struggle to decide which
smartphone will be there next by the way
if you write in twice or more than once
and you detect that we are having
trouble with your name the first time
around and it's pronunciation please
append notes to help us pronounce it on
this go-around please Bert cocaine says
we don't have any trouble with that name
Bert cocaine says he sent us a message i
think last week the one before San I
want to go to to sprint and I need a the
best Windows Phone there is and we were
like there's no possible way you can do
that sprint barely has anything so he's
clarifying he says I'm moving from
sprint to t-mobile that changes
everything sprint does not have a range
of choices for devices in my area next
reason I'm leaving my
three and moving to Windows Phone is
more to do with use alongside a tablet
than anything else I have a 7-inch
galaxy tab for that i love but it's way
too similar to my note 3 as far as the
m8 vs 640 these just seemed like the
best choices on t-mobile are there
others for Windows Phone that are better
than these hi Otto we're going to press
you into service for the first time uh
you know coming many times on this show
as a tmobile escho team little boy yeah
what what help can you lend to our
friend Bert cocaine well anytime our
nokia or our microsoft now Rep comes in
just to show us the new nokia or
microsoft phone we always end up having
a conversation about how there are
really no good windows phones on tmobile
these days um especially at the store I
work at where we don't carry the m8 for
Windows that's oh sort of it's sort of a
scattered um no no police on there um so
really I mean the only the only good
windows phone you can get on tmobile
right now is the MA and I don't know if
they're even still selling that one or
if they've they've stopped the same way
that we don't carry the Android I made
anymore if you can get your hands on
that that's probably what I'd recommend
unless you don't mind paying full price
and buying an unlocked windows phone
that would be better I thinking of which
essentially came across the news feeds
today it came from a competitor so I
think we can I think we're safe and
mentioning this though that Windows
Phone central posted a thing I'm today
talking about ebates was selling
unlocked and refurbished Lumia 1520 s
for 249 dollars that's a nice lady whoa
yeah so I was wondering and it's funny
because i was reading this question when
that came across Twitter I'm like ah and
that and it's a really good thing that
that came across litter because I had no
other answers for you at all so uh huh I
mean it is a refurb you got to keep that
in mind there yeah you know but it's
online just cuz oh hey just be able to
get tmobile Wow absolutely and as I
understand it hi Otto you should be able
to heat up goes for that option or
decides to buy alumium
9 30 which would be another
recommendation of mine hardly an
original one or even an 830 if you're
trying to save some money the 834 what
you pay it should be cheaper i still
think or it should have been at lunch
but it's it's a pretty good value you
should just be able to grab an NSM from
t-mobile and put in there right that's
right yeah there we go Bert cocaine I
hope you have some you have some luck
there good luck in the move congrats on
being satisfied with your tablet and you
know we are going to see some new
windows phone hardware this year but
it's who knows at this point what what
even month it's going to be you probably
announce something it build but it's
going to be a while so if you're looking
to make this purchase now yeah 15 20 or
930 or the 830 if you're going to save
some money and if you have a couple
weeks see what the 640 XL is like maybe
it'll be cheaper than the 830 but I
think for my money I an 830 be a bit
better by between those two just cuz the
camera but the 1520 is a damn good deal
though if it's a solid deal it is a
refurb that gives me a little bit of
pause if it's a green refurb let me not
let green colors mad hot when that
happened on this is what phone should i
get number two you want to read lakota
bees email adam doubt or however as soon
as i find it what was the subject line
oh you know why is choosing so hard okay
I got this yeah dear flaca del team love
what you're doing you got to put on the
glasses I have been a loyal listener
since day one I apologize if this email
gets lengthy that's fine we're just
going to go ahead and skip over a couple
of things you use HD si si si you're on
an iphone 6 and verizon iphone 6 is
great at a power on the go for pho and
photo editing and ague i'm assuming good
camera um well try to switch between a
lot of photo apps and get on tumblr so
you're the one that gets on tumblr
anyway it starts from a great radio down
your works great job on this uh start to
notice that the one gigabyte of RAM
kills me and so I'll capsule an
explanation point seriously considering
galaxy note 4 but then I saw the Galaxy
Note edge and I really liked it and
might they feel it my handles good the
curved screen made one hand
is pretty easy ish and I think multi
window and the s-pen could really help
my multitasking however should i wait
for the note 5 or the note f note 5 edge
because i really like the edge on one
side and not both sides like the galaxy
s6 edge and that's not the right reason
you should not like the galaxy s6 edge
but we'll talk about that in a second I
do have one of my lines ready for
upgrade now and I want to breach really
appreciate your guys input alright so
this is easy right if you're going to
wait for the note it's going to be
September yeah member announced October
availability that's a long time to wait
if you're looking upgrade now upgrade
now yeah so I wrote it down a couple of
notes on this one great tasting phones
because of the note edge but I'm afraid
it will be a laggy mess before long if
you if you go with a note for edge of
the note the note edge which doesn't
have a number not necessarily I mean
what it won't it won't be why would if I
would it be it's TouchWiz and that does
not end well the TouchWiz does not age
well that is correct but I just got the
lollipop update on the note 4 on our
verizon note for which we just took
delivery on and I am I mean that's a new
device to private just fresh out of the
box but um so my nose go on to say the
s6 edge is a handcuffed edge so don't
get that and I would wait for the note 5
edge to see if a samsung returns the
edge functionality and actually makes
the edge useful again and be Samsung
maintains its light skinny this is like
the one time that I will ever advocate
for waiting for a new phone but this is
probably the one case where I would
actually consider consider waiting
interesting hi Otto do you have a
thought here I really have a mess with
the no edge much at all that's another
phone we don't carry at my specific
t-mobile store um so I don't really have
any any valuable input on the note edge
I can't say me if you get the note for
it's still a really really good phone
it's only fantastic yes six months old
now eight seven months old weather alert
there I'm preparing a comparison between
the s6 and the note for right now and
I'm heavily leaning toward like I mean
it's it's tough to find a reason beyond
aesthetics that you would
that you would pick the note for ya
quick the s6 I'm sorry here's something
building the studio around me especially
especially with the edge and you know he
specifically alludes to the edge
functionality which is not there on the
s6 you know the really the only thing
that the s6 edge is good for is you know
this context of the glowing for a
different color swiping to quickly
access a contact but the one thing that
made the edge awesome in my in my view
and I know Michael absolutely disagrees
with this categorically was the fact
that the edge was so useful on you know
in terms of getting the f you know the
app launcher is over on the sign then it
depends on what you mean by youthful I
think I mean I don't know I was just
about to explain that if you look kind
of finish Kenneth enough but you know
having the you know the viewfinder for
the camera the controls up on the top
it's stuff like that that was absol as
opposed to this gimmicky contacts up
what they're doing that they're doing
these days and so if Samsung can get
back to that it's just it's like they
had this really great concept of the
edge and then they just completely look
like all right a very very quick story
um when my son was learning how to ride
right up like the first time he wrote a
bike without training wheels i was
running along behind him I let go of the
bike and he started going he got about
10 feet before I panicked and grabbed
him and said oh my god you're gonna fall
and I realized wait he's not going to
fall and so I let him ride his bike I
wish Samsung had just let the darn kid
riding bike I don't know why they had to
handcuff this functionality you know
it's funny I have not figured out a way
to activate the edge screen and the s6
edge yet like it's been like five days
and I have I have all the features
turned out but I can't do that like
thumb action that likes the in from the
side and back out or out for the to the
side back in like nothing I do will
activate the stupid edge screen so i
will say that i actually i agree with
you Adam but on the s6 edge it's nice
just just the look is so much nicer
everyone who told me this while I was
holding the regular Essex for like a
week
was right this is a gorgeous gorgeous
device I almost worth the extra hundo
just for the aesthetics of the girl it's
almost actually it's almost worth the
extra hundo just to be able to do that
little swiping like to swipe in the
slidable menus on android the open the
what menus on android like a sliding
menus on android like oh yeah yeah yeah
you had to pull them from the side yeah
it feels so cool on the on the s6 edge
yeah it's but no spoilers on that non
our final conclusion toyota you were
right though so anyway my vote was to
wait what are you guys thinking i don't
i don't see the you know it's such a
long time to wait it's not even the
summer like we just got into the spring
it's gonna be fall late fall by the time
this thing is wide availability this
note 5 whatever it's going to be and i
bet that they're not going to be able to
pack in much better hardware than
they're doing right now I bet they're
gonna tweak some aesthetics probably put
in a screen with 800 pixels every inch
that you just don't need and you know i
think the note 4 is such a good device
that it's if if you really want it
whether if you want the note 4 or the
edge variant um you know I think you
should jump on it now okay put it in
pixels a reach out and grab you by your
eyeballs right I thought I had the note
in my hand just now and I got excited
about pulling out the s-pen so it could
help me with the pocket but I don't have
that stuff so it's fine it's fine I'll
live with the s6 edge because my life is
apparently horrible hey what's the next
thing um my goodness I picked a lot of
long emails I'm gonna power through this
one hi Otto get ready to read the next
one okay all right this one is going to
be from Ian repel dear pocket now first
praise for the podcast longtime listener
first-time writer save a few Q&amp;amp;A
questions I Capri she ate the thorough
and intelligent conversation of an
industry i find fascinating thanks again
but to move on to bread predicament I've
deemed it time to move on from my oh so
beloved Nexus 5 everybody pay attention
because it starts talking my roms and I
don't get robbed I slept rom after
Rahman to it before feeling unique by
using the l dev preview and then calming
down like a return from a midlife crisis
back to stock five dot 0 but now my baby
is growing dated growing alongside a
bug-ridden five dot one update
experience and I'm shopping from the
next
ice I'm working on tmobile and I have
many little preferences to account for
I'm interested in the galaxy s6 but that
battery size life terrifies me indeed
alongside the fingerprint making
backside the m9 has a lovely unibody but
a camera reported to be not so good
isn't the best situation coming from the
Nexus here's what I want bigger better
battery a better camera a larger size
phablets are fine price is no concern so
do I get the shiny s6 edge the sleek m9
or desperately wait for its larger
brother to come to the u.s. the
soon-to-be LG g4 or even the sony z 4 is
the note 4 still viable lead this sheep
home thank you for the great content and
the aid in my tech choices sorry for the
length it's quite the predicament indeed
it is in this is a difficult question
since we were just talking about 4 i'm
just going to jump in with it I think
the note 4 is certainly still viable
you've got a big battery it's removable
it doesn't last as long as its
predecessors but it lasts longer than
most of the phones you just listed
particularly the s6 if cameras are
concern the m9 takes good ones if you're
not going to scrutinize every every
pixel but if you spend a lot of time in
the dark you're right it's not the right
phone g 4 z4 we don't know anything
about nexus 6 doesn't have the better
life it should for such a big phone but
that's another pretty okay option in my
view I'm leaning toward note for nexus 6
what do you guys think Adam in hi Otto
well originally I thought Nexus 6 but
then he mentions that he's not really a
big fan of olive lollipop so right but
the five dot one update just dropped
that was why I selected this was to make
that clear cuz you know that that that's
is supposed to smooth out a lot of the
performance problems in fact I dota 2 so
yeah I mean if you're concerned about
battery life then you know the es6
battery life concerns are definitely
legitimate can the m9 camera be fixed
with software I wonder or is that just a
bad sense that's the question
everybody's asking and I don't think
it's a bad sensor we've talked about it
before toshiba makes the Lumia sensors
yeah so I mean if that can be fixed with
an update then I guess you know the vm 9
would probably be the way to go
otherwise yeah i was thinking Nexus 6
you know I guess known for would be okay
um but yeah I mean pretty much
everything you get these days gonna have
lollipops so uh yeah that's that's
pretty much where I am and also just so
you know you can't and actually go back
on the Nexus 5 all the way back to four
dot one if you want so yeah but who died
altered that yeah that there were some
there was a camera update I wanted to
say this I did it last week but people
keep asking me like are you gonna go
rira view the m9 now that the update
fixed the camera that update only
updated us versions of the m9 gene we
were already running on our EMEA device
guys we're not going to re-review it
with the same software I know it's
confusing and it's but I just get asked
that a couple times a day and I have to
clarify it over a couple of times a day
but unless you know cut updated what
other than that my only on the thought
was Moto X so but then there's also like
sesame my battery life yeah one of
concerns are too so it's not really bad
in get my my my battery got a lot better
on the Moto X with the latest software
update so I did it yeah I mean it lasts
me probably actually three or four hours
a day with the with the last update no
kidding yeah it's really good back to my
Moto X then um I overall though for for
his question I'd probably say either the
Nexus 6 of the note 4 as well um the
nexus 6 didn't have great battery life
compared to some other phones but uh
especially since he said he has done
some robbing he's obviously pretty
familiar and comfortable with with
modding his phone Joey what I did the
piece a while ago or I don't think you
did pc uh just tweeted about it i think
but he he found a tweak to reduce the
the resolution on the screen to only
1080p instead of qhd and he said got him
significantly better battery life oh I
think how do you how does it tweak
adjust the number of pixels on them on
an AMOLED panel I don't so it's still
obviously all pixel mm still owe pixel
they're still gonna be on but that's the
cuz the DPI oh I see okay yeah it's it's
the output resolution is what
Jules is saying basically phone you're
still technically getting you know the
2560 by 1600 pixels but it only has to
actually create the 1080p resolution and
so it's saving it's mostly its timing on
the Jeep I'm the chi pu side right yeah
yeah yeah man so on Jojo so that gave
him significantly better value life so
if he's comfortable doing that then
maybe sure it's like the downscaling win
games when games have to run at reduced
resolution on some phones yeah yeah oh
that's interesting okay but they're
initially stupid reaction but I was just
like would i'd still probably say no for
overall just because he also wanted a
good camera and the nexus 6 doesn't
exactly offer that either yeah but above
all if if you're if you're hopping all
over the place in wait wait for the g4
we got a couple weeks for the g4 wait to
see what that's going to bring to the
table and it's a sony every week we got
six more rumors on the sony z 4 but the
latest rumor we have has it may be
coming in on the 20th the announcement
so we'll see if that's true and if you
don't like the z4 just wait you know
three or four more weeks and something
input on another phone so weird up there
you go uh we got to move this along
Andrew Burgess is our last piece of mail
in the what phone should I get and then
we've got one listener mail after that
and I'm a high auto can you read that
one yeah so Andrew says thank you for
the amazing content you put out every
week to the point where just where you
are one of the few websites and YouTube
channels that I check every single day
um I'm what you'd call it tough spot
regarding my next smartphone purchase
and I'll try to be as brief as possible
my dream device is probably the next
Moto X but my problem is with Android
lollipop ever since my ATT note 3
received the five-point update it's been
slower than my iphone 4 that I had
nearly four years ago exclamation all
night ! based on these experiences and
your reviews lollipop has indeed become
the windows vista of android in my mind
I'd be fine with the current Moto X but
only
if it hasn't gotten updated to the
Lalique off yet which does it ships out
of the box with it doesn't it uh yeah
now it does yeah um see although if
Michael or anyone else you know has had
positive experiences with the update
i'll reconsider i'll be making a final
decision within the next two months so
time isn't is an urgent urgent
incredibly urgent to me i prefer to
stick to android because none of the
current windows phone offering strike my
fancy and i'm not an apple person my
question is as follows are there any Kit
Kat phones left that I can grab in that
time frame or you still have any other
recommendations I love to hear your
opinions thanks again for your help and
have an awesome day so this is I this is
great i picked it specifically so that i
could say no i don't think i don't think
it's a good idea to go for a previous
release software just because you liked
it better i understand it completely
believe me I get it but I also as we
said on the last answer you know five
dot one is supposed to have fixed a lot
of performance issues hi Otto is finding
out that on his moto x you're getting
what three or four more hours about her
life I said yeah it's a lot better yeah
and and how's the responsiveness on it I
haven't noticed any performance issues
it's been pretty good um it's got the
standard lollipop issue that I've had
with pretty much every phone besides the
m9 which is whenever I launch the
multitasking it takes a really long time
yeah that's about my only my only issue
with I like with the latest update to
lollipop on the Moto X they definitely
need to follow this up with like in 5 2
or 5 25 or whatever they do with you
know project tallow or something you
know like a good project lard or it's
some kind of follow-up to the butter
thing because when they announced that
everyone rejoiced and everyone's like
jelly bean that's awesome it's smooth
isn't it this is amazing the days of lag
and Android are over and then of course
they painted lollipop with all these
pretty project lipid yeah jewels and a
lollipop with all these pretty pretty
colors and material design it and it is
beautiful but it's really suffered in
the performance so five dot one where
we're seeing fix a lot of that stuff so
I wouldn't be too apprehensive do you
agree doubt or do have a different view
I mean the only phones
can get these days that have Kit Kat on
them are the aforementioned Nexus 5
which like I said you can sideload any
OS from 41 up onto it i actually have
four dot for running on my Nexus 5 just
because I'm not a big fan of lollipop
myself um and I you know I've got the
one plus one which supposedly has cm12
out which is based on lollipop but I
haven't gotten it yet so I'm a little on
the fence about that one so but beyond
that I mean I don't think there's really
anything else out there that's shipping
with with KitKat on it so I think there
I honestly you just gotta you gotta
stick your head down in charge charge
forward can you cancel needles and full
speed ahead who was that that was
somebody that i never knew personally
who is one man that has never been in my
kitchen yeah exactly alright let me pin
right nice thank you this is mr. mail
just to wrap us up on the show because
we're a little bit over time and this is
a big one Joe Levi was kind enough to
answer this one for us in absentia so
poor little odd for Joe Levi um he's
still around but you know he has to be
to write in his responses so William Lee
writes hi everyone quick question on
quick charging why is it that the first
half of the battery charges faster than
the second half Joel as I write back
well that's a very definition of a brief
listener mail by the way so all of your
listeners pay attention because her
point exactly Joe Levi rights that's a
great question William just start out
let me lay a little background I Drive a
Prius yeah yeah yeah well you're busy
snickering I'm busy getting 42 miles per
gallon Oh super unlike most other cars
and my Prius doesn't have a gas tank
it's got a bladder I didn't know this by
the way the bladder is basically a
squishy bag into which the gasoline is
pumped it expands and contracts while in
use to accommodate the volume of
gasoline that it's holding when I fill
up with gasoline every three weeks
uh-huh the first part feels pretty
quickly but the last two gallons take a
long time why when the bladder is empty
it can take in a lot of gasoline
very quickly as it gets full and the
bladder is forced to expand by the
incoming liquid vapors back up the fill
tube causing the nozzle to click off
since the tank is only ten point nine
gallons stopping at nine gallons means
I'm cheating myself out of almost a
hundred miles of driving on that Phillip
so after the nozzle clicks off I pump
the rest slowly by hand until it's got
at least ten point five gallons in it
those last few gallons take longer to
pump than the first eight all right
what's all that got to do with batteries
although a battery isn't the same as a
gas tank the concepts are similar
electricity flowing through a circuit
behaves very similarly to how a liquid
flows through a system as a battery
fills resistance increases just like the
bladder in my Prius a side effect of
this is heat heat increases resistance
resistance increases heat and so on if
left unchecked a condition called
thermal runaway occurs boom to mitigate
all this the charging circuit monitors
the heat state of charge etc once a
certain set of conditions is met it
scales back the charge rate limiting
amps voltage etc just like i do when i
manually fill the last two gallons of my
Prius another example just for fun this
is a shorter one let's say your battery
is a five gallon bucket that you're
filling with a fire hose at full blast
you might be able to fill half the
bucket quickly but if you don't hurry
and scale back the pressure on the hose
you're going to end up with water
spraying all over the place and you
might find you've only filled up a small
portion of the bucket to fill the rest
of the bucket you'll have to fill it
slowly maybe even down to a trickle to
get that last little bit in to fill it
to one hundred percent capacity Joe Levi
well done Joe thanks well done Joe
thanks good stuff hey guys I'm actually
coming up against the heart of stuff
here so can ya we gotta go yeah we got a
rabbi ok get out of here tell everywhere
they can find you on the internet really
quickly you can find me on Twitter at
dead technology or if you're interested
in a technology podcast I got a pimpette
sorry Michael yeah a great vibe tech
beard calm tek de ard come on we are a
bi weekly podcast discusses all things
tech and most things geek hosted by
yours truly so thank you very much both
for having me on
I doubt thank you for being here yeah I
hate to split seconds before the outro
music which I love so much but I really
got a book it's not a problem man thank
you for being with us thank you for
taking over when I disappeared against
my will and we will see you very soon
absolutely thanks everybody for
listening you're awesome later brother
well hi Otto stick around for two
seconds so we can answer the most
upvoted questions in the queue a I had
to like chop them down because a lot of
them were talking about flickering video
green screens audio explosions and a lot
of other hangouts problems that that we
had no control over so sorry everyone
thanks for sticking with us etc what are
your thoughts on a six point eight inch
fhd display on a phone asks Luke but hmm
I want none of that cheese yeah no no in
almost seven inch fhd display whoa is
that the what is that the p p8 max or
something the huawei thing because they
were talking about isn't isn't it it's
not with somebody else why are we being
asked about this because you didn't talk
about that in the hands-on because i
only got hands-on with the p8 itself 6.8
if HD display wow if my assumption is
right yes it is in fact Huawei p8 5 all
right so there's a 5.2 inch full HD
screen on the p8 but then the p8 max
with a six point eight inch fhd display
indeed yeah that's insane it's and I see
that Huawei this is my first time
looking at their dot view case for this
things interesting choice uh I really
really get frustrated when people just
straight-up rip off stuff and that is I
don't know that list it's kind of nice
to just see that kind of it like to
other phones because it's the Dove you
and the mi is so cool it is cool and
that's why it's like I don't know it's a
long time it's always a long
conversation when you get into like did
they copy this other company
conversation and it's but that's blatant
than it sucks I think anyway whatever
did you see the new Star Wars trailer
asks matthew Miller it's not mobile tech
but I still want to know it's a good
question i meant to watch it before the
show i have not seen it yet what about
you hired i haven't
see you neither all right it's gonna be
badass from what I understand all Benna
Jonas come out we'll talk about the
Microsoft and signage and partnership
when we have more time and Jonathan wats
same deal and Jonathan wats we're gonna
close out the show with your comment
which really kept us going that's okay
Michael we're all in this together that
made me feel better I don't know which
particular difficulty I was bitching
about when you posted that but thank you
Jonathan that made me feel good motto
now we're in a segment called weekend
reading which I would have forgotten
about if Jules didn't put the drops
right on top of my head there thanks
buddy appreciate it this is a one minute
segment where I tell you about something
cool in the heady days of the dawn of
radio the word wireless meant a very
different thing indeed this week in fact
just the other night marks the hundred
and third anniversary of the sinking of
the Titanic where wireless telegraphy
played a crucial role historian parks
Stephenson or Steffensen I've been
reading them for a long time I don't
know his last name has amassed a massive
information Titanic in a particular
Marconi installation at his website
Marconi graph comm tragic circumstances
aside the complexity of the century old
equipment is a helpful reminder of the
sophisticated technology we carry in our
own pockets today go check it out he's
gonna it's a great article and it's just
ridiculous how look at the thing and the
expert the excerpt on the site is like
odds the vertical lead in its
corresponding wire in the horizontal
flat top was connected by means of a
mcintyre connector with two 20-foot
spreaders and towered hemp rope ratline
keeping it stable I don't know how five
percent of that entire system work and
it's over a century old and it should
should you know remind you that the
stuff we talked about is very
sophisticated stuff so don't throw your
phone if you're mad at who you're
talking to mmm it it's it's a very
complex piece of equipment mine just
buzzed me everything it was my fault so
that's your weekend reading folks please
enjoy that and with that I'm going to
say to hi Otto thanks man it is great to
have you back on the show as a
contributor please come on
