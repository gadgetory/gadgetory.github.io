different hey guys its brand am in them
in front pocket now and this is hands-on
with iOS 7 on the iPhone 5 let's get to
it so we are looking at beta 1 this is a
Developer Preview the final version will
be out in the fall in a few months 3 or
4 months for everyone to download but we
wanted to give you a look at what I oh
s7 is like using it because there is a
lot here guys it goes really really deep
so even your starting on the lockscreen
swipe to unlock is no longer just on the
bottom you can swipe to unlock from
anywhere along the lockscreen and when
we do a swipe to unlock we have a new
animation to go to your home screen it's
a subtle little touch but again it just
shows that everything in iOS 7 has been
redone so if we swipe to unlock and two
icons float in first and then everything
follows behind it we've got all new
fonts we've got a thinner skinnier kind
of cleaner looking font here we've also
got a new color palette which some
people are not going to like it's a neon
color palette and you can really tell
down here on the phone and the messages
icon it is just this bright neon green
that you that you might have seen in a
storybook when you are a little kid now
speaking of little kid these icons are
so incredibly simplistic some people
think and it is my opinion that they
look like they've been haphazardly
designed I mean look at this Safari icon
look at the settings icon I mean there's
a point at which you might go a little
too extreme and making things simple and
clean but there's a lot to us 7 that is
really quite beautiful let's jump into
the settings which has been totally
redesigned settings was getting really
ugly in iOS 6 and below and so we've got
a much more cleaner look here everything
is as you'd expect it everything is
where it's been before but there are
some new settings I want to go over the
first thing I want to show you is
brightness and wallpaper so if we go to
choose wallpaper and Apple now has a
dynamic wallpaper also known as live
wallpaper which Android has been doing
for years of course and right now there
are only two to choose from while we're
in the screen I want to show you
something that's really cool we get this
back option which has been in iOS 6 for
a very long time but new to iOS 7 is the
ability to swipe backwards let me let me
show you that again just a really handy
gesture for one
handed usability and this is present
throughout the entire operating system
whether you're in messages or you're
making a new bookmark in Safari and
there is that back icon you can always
do the swipe and you can even do it
repeatedly to go back throughout all of
the settings that you're going through
now go I'm gonna go back in wallpaper
one second because Apple is doing a cool
trick with the wallpaper I'm gonna go to
stills and I'm gonna choose this
wallpaper and I'm gonna click set look
very very clean-looking buttons no more
gloss no more shine so I'm gonna click
set both apples doing this cool thing
with the background where when you move
the phone the icons move it's very very
subtle the icons move along with the
background you might not even be able to
tell it gives us interesting effect the
icons are sort of floating on top of the
background again it's so incredibly
subtle you barely notice it they'll
probably Ratchet that up or down as the
betas progress here at iOS 7 let's go
back into the settings see what else we
have here can we're to use that back
gesture which is really nice and we've
got Notification Center here which has
been redone and let's pull that down
what this lets you do here in the
Notification Center you've got three
tabs which is today all and missed you
still can't swipe away notifications
like you can an Android unfortunately
but this is kind of a cool little glance
of glanceable view that lets you see
what you're doing today see all of your
notifications of your missed
notifications you can't swipe between
them like again you can an Android and
what's also kind of neat about the
notification shade is that it's slightly
translucent so if you have a background
that has some color on it you'll just
kind of see through it and Apple is
really doing a lot of this gauzy and
blur kind of effect where it looks like
a layer on top of another layer which is
just a really nice UI touch so let's go
back into here we've got some new
settings for Notification Center not
going to go through them too much
in-depth look at these new toggles kind
of these basic toggles they don't look
metallic anymore they look just sort of
graphical very very simple and clean we
can turn various things off in the
Notification Center and so forth we've
got a new thing called control center
which the jailbreaking community has
been doing for a very long time swiping
up from the bottom will bring up this
quick control and just like the
Notification Center it will inherit the
color of the background so if we're on
the home screen here more
whoo you get that kind of blueish look
if you're in settings it's kind of white
you swipe up you get a kind of white
look and from here you can toggle on
Bluetooth Wi-Fi Do Not Disturb screen
lock and you can see everything that is
here you get some quick shortcuts down
here to stuff that you cannot change
such as the camera calculator no idea
what the heck that is and flashlight so
this will bring you into your obviously
your your calculator if you tap and hold
on this nothing happens you cannot
change them we're going to the camera in
a minute another thing that's been
changed is the multitask UI and this is
again another thing that the
jailbreaking community has been doing
for eons they've been making this card
view and Apple finally did it so what
you get here and let's let's start from
the beginning here if you double tap the
home button first you start off with
your most recently used app and then if
you swipe over you get three things on
the screen at the top at a time this
looks a lot like Windows Phone to me and
it's it's a little bit low on utility
because you can only see four things on
the screen at a time actually one two
three four five to be exact and just
like in the multitask switchers of the
jailbreak community you can swipe up and
exit the app and it shows you a full
screen preview of these things which is
really nice looking not exactly sure
it's more efficient than the old icon
thing but it's definitely a lot more
beautiful let's go into Safari because
the browser has been changed and
speaking of the browser when we go up
here to the web address bar you're gonna
see the new Kay the new keyboard here
which is really nice
so we are gonna go to pocketnow.com but
interestingly the keyboard only will
work if the developer supports it so for
example if we go into the Facebook app
which obviously has not been updated for
iOS 7 yet and we go over here and we
search you're gonna see the old keyboard
so developers have to update their app
to include the new keyboard which is a
little bit of a shame but it's just
gonna take some time so I'm gonna use
the multi task switcher to go back here
to pocket now and we've got a new UI
here for the browser we've got these
icons on the bottom which again might be
too much to the degree of simplicity
because you might not know what they do
until you actually press them
the share button here and from here you
still can't share to third-party like
Instagram and other services that you
might have on an Android phone for
example we can do airdrop that's a new
feature then there's these other things
that we can do here plus print over here
is your bookmarks kind of used to that
and again here's a place in the UI where
you have that back button so I can just
do that swipe to go back which is nice
I'm gonna click done up there down here
we have a new tab UI that looks a lot
like what Google Chrome does so we've
got this kind of 3d view then we've got
a really cool listing of the iCloud
bookmarks if you have an iPad or another
iPhone and from here we can just tap on
your tab and go to the next running and
so forth browser performances it's just
fine it's always good on iOS as you move
along the page here you kind of get this
full-screen view which is a really nice
thing and over up here at the top you
see the address bar it kind of collapses
and there's a little bit of translucency
it's very subtle but if you look at
where the AT&amp;amp;T logo is you might see the
images kind of tint the color there we
go see the blue so a lot of little
subtle touches like this just make I Oh
s delightful to use and speaking of the
AT&amp;amp;T logo look at the new signal bars
they are no longer the standard you know
bars they're just circles with dots
filled in with color a little touch I'm
not sure that they had to fix something
that wasn't broken but but but there you
have it
so let's go into the photo gallery I
know this is getting to be a long video
but there's just a whole lot to show you
here go to the photo gallery it's really
interesting what they've done here
because a lot of people have this
situation right where you have so many
pictures to go through them you got to
kind of flip flip flip flip flip and
some people thousands of pictures so now
either
now pictures are organized by all kinds
of criteria you start off by years right
so we're gonna go into years and we're
gonna go into collections and again
there's that back button there which
means that we can do the do the swipe
here sometimes maybe maybe not maybe not
in this screen and from collections we
can drill down a little bit further and
then we go to moments which is kind of
cool because iOS is trying to group your
photos into events things that happen
kind of like each the HTC one does with
events and some other phones can do and
from here that's really as far as you
can go you can tap on a picture you can
zoom in you can click Edit to click on
to the editing tools and so forth kind
of what you're used to and then you can
back all the way out and you just have a
nicer way to organize your photos which
is quite fantastic finally let's take a
look at the camera see what they've done
here we've got a new UI here I'm going
to go into landscape and we can either
click on the name of the different type
of photo here which is pano square photo
and video or you can actually swipe and
there's really not that much more you
can do with it this is this is always oh
it has always been iOS as thing except
that now we get real-time effects
something that Android has been doing
forever which is kind of cool
taking advantage of modern processing
technology to be able to do this on the
fly it's kind of cool so there's my hand
with an effect and and so forth it takes
photos pretty cool and another thing
here to show you is folders folders has
been redone this is what folders look
like they're just these grey sort of
rounded circle the square things but the
cool thing about folders now is that you
can have multiple panels for folders and
there's no limit to how many panels you
can have we really haven't been able to
hit the maximum there's probably a
maximum of you know 9 times 10 90 icons
in a folder but this is actually kind of
ugly and unfortunately another thing
that they did not change with iOS 7 is
that folders don't close when you click
into an app so if I go into doodle jump
and then I go back to the homescreen
folder stays open that's not how it's
supposed to go
Android has it right where it closes the
folder so overall what we see here is a
very very deep redesign of everything
that you know about iOS and it really
does look nice it's incredibly different
some people are gonna have trouble with
these neon colors but you got to admit
that there's this overall smoothness
that has been brought to the operating
system that just wasn't there before
it's definitely a lot more modern than
before however there's no new
functionality that really puts it ahead
of the other operating systems out there
which is a huge leg up for Android and
for Windows Phone because Android is
focusing a lot on functionality with
Google now and bringing information to
you before you know you need it and
Windows Phone well when this one is
entirely different of course on its own
so iOS 7 something to definitely look
forward to it's not a paradigm shift
it's just a refinement really on pretty
much the entire experience which is a
great thing do i disability oh please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching
that's it for now
