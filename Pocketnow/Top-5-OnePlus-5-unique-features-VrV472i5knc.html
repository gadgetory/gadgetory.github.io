sheep killer is now official the 1+5 has
just been announced and before I bore
you with a special edition of the
bargain out daily that just focuses on
this phone why don't we discuss what
makes this phone unique I'm high memory
that up with pocket now and these are
top five reasons why we recommend you
consider the oneplus five number five is
the fact that this phone is actually
more global than any other product out
there for example if you bought yourself
a Galaxy s8 there's a variant in Canada
varies in the United States and there's
also a variant in Europe whereas in the
case of the one plus five it is just one
phone and it is a dual SIM phone so
there are a couple of advantages where
you don't have to actually deal with
problems whenever you roam fly around I
think this is probably one of the
features that the company didn't mention
and I would say it's one of the coolest
ones indeed number four is the fact that
this phone actually carries the latest
and greatest hardware you've got
Bluetooth five where there are
reflections from 2017 that don't have it
and then you have ufs 2.1 and this is
where it's an advantage that there is
just one SKU you can pretty much know
that it doesn't matter which variant you
get you will be getting that ufs 2.1
whereas in the case of devices like the
Galaxy s8 the si+ does include ufs 2.1
the SI dozen so that is another
advantage of a one plus five
number three eight gigabytes of ram and
for those of you that say a gigabytes is
overkill I don't know if you've noticed
but in devices like the LG G six or in
the galaxy s 8 you pretty much only get
like seven hundred and fifty megabytes
left after the whole operating system
and everything loads so multitasking can
sometimes become a pain after a couple
of apps are being launched or these apps
are being closed aggressively in the
case of the one plus three T within
relax a deal with that we had six
gigabytes of RAM here we've got oxygen
OS that's close to near to stock in
addition to the fact that you also have
the advantage of a gigabytes of RAM go
crazy doing whatever you want with that
phone number to one plus has finally
figured out the camera and I would
highly suggest you watch Kwan's real
camera review he goes into full detail
over why this camera matters one of our
biggest complaints in the past with
plus 3t for example was the fact that
you're buying a flagship killer but one
of the main reasons that makes a
flagship a flagship is its awesome
camera performance and we didn't get
that with previous one plus devices with
the whole partnership with the XO it
seems that they've finally figured it
out and finally the top number one
feature that makes the oneplus 5 matter
is its price tag it continues its legacy
of being a flagship killer $479 buys you
a lot of the things you can't really get
on most black ships out there and if you
won't pay $50 more you get a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of storage I think it
doesn't really get better than that
obviously this is not a perfect phone
there are things that could have been
included that weren't so it leads me to
the question of this video what do you
think about the 1 + 5 now that it's live
do you think that you would buy this
phone or not in my case I do recommend
it I do want it but it was a comment
