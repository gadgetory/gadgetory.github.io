Android wear SmartWatch for fitness
would have been a total no-go but that
was before polar did something about it
I'm high memory better with pocket now
and this is our first look at the polar
m600
ever since polar developed the first
ever wireless heart rate monitor more
than 30 years ago
the company has gained significant
popularity and Trust among the fitness
community and if not look around at the
gym a lot of people wear Polar's now all
that prestige only gains an added level
of convenience when smarter technologies
are blended together and that's the
particular case of the new m600
SmartWatch running Android where the
polar m600 ships in a minimalistic box
with bold text that claims that now you
can while referencing all its new
SmartWatch features within the box
you'll find your new SmartWatch a
proprietary magnetic charger and the
standard literature that many of us are
accustomed to by design the m600 is
extremely unique from the soft touch
strap to the squared 1.3 inch display
flanked by chrome accents the watch
exudes quality the minute you hold it
for the first time there are some things
about the m600 that not only make it
stand apart from other Fitness watches
but even from other Android wear
offerings for starters the band is fully
replaceable addressing one of the main
complaints of fitness watches and
extending the lifespan of the m600
second this is one of the few Android
wear smartwatches with a built-in GPS
for accurate tracking of outdoor
activity the m600 is also ipx8
water-resistant meaning yes the tracking
can even include swimming third look at
this heart rate sensor it's huge
polar is famous for being the best at
heart rate monitoring and by the looks
alone there is a lot of hardware to back
that claim up here fourth and most
important the main difference is how the
watch works instead of making you fumble
around Android wear menus Poehler
included the convenience of an extra
button that's focused specifically on
fitness activities for the button to
work you first need to install polar
flow after the set of process is done
polar flow is where the magic is at as
it helps you define what fitness
activities you want the watch to track
through the button and then gives you a
very comprehensive overview of your
daily activities sleep tracking and then
consolidates this and
very detailed weekly graphs now all this
being said what's best at the m600 in
combination with polar flow is that this
is one of the few watches that actually
provides real-time heart rate zone
information heart rate zone awareness is
crucial for smarter training as your
goals may either be weight loss or
improvement in physical condition almost
every other Smart Watch gets this all
wrong and it's the main reason why I
praised what polar has done here NES for
everything else this is pretty much a
standard Android wear SmartWatch with
access to thousands of applications from
the Google Play Store and the most
robust messaging experience that I've
had with smartwatches in addition to an
evolving ecosystem now this has just
really been a week of testing the polar
m600 our review period has really just
begun and we'd love for you to chime in
