one way around the only company who's
got a solution for you this is the ZTE
grand memo to and man this thing is big
let's go through this I'm every better
with parking now Tony behind the camera
ZTE grand memo to now wait a second this
is a very interesting this way let me
turn this off notice that it's like a
sort of a matte texture this is an IPS
display but when you look at it it's
actually not as glary as every other
this way that we've used you know I kind
of even think that it's plastic but the
thing is it doesn't reflect your face if
you look at doesn't reflect the camera
either it's a really interesting
technology so again this is an IPS
display we've got a new flat UI from
busy te there is no app tray you can
definitely add more stuff more widgets
or add enough pains as you want the ZTE
phone is running sadly s damn dragon
more of your father's
not a flagship phone under us standards
android 4.4 out of the box we do have
two gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage that
is expandable we've got the typical
typical settings we go into that Sam
version of the UI that we hate again for
more put you right here and again the
ZTE bonus huge is insanely big it's got
a sort of like no it's for textures of
magnets what you're seeing carbon fiber
two atoms so you have a 13 got another
microphone down here we've got a 5
megapixel camera and all the typical
century it's very very interesting you
are they'll be happier we're definitely
going to be looking at it and our future
of you hopefully go again
well market now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
