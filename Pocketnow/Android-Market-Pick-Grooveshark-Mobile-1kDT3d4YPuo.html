pakman.com and today machine probably
one of my favorite applications all time
now this is called grooveshark mobile
and it allows you to play nearly any
song in the entire world on your android
device so let's get started okay so here
we are on grooveshark mobile which is
free to download on Android Market but
you will need a VIP subscription and it
is about three dollars a month or thirty
dollars a year so very reasonable the
cool thing about this is you can search
for any song pretty much in the world so
let's see here I'm going to search for
owl city and see what we come up with
and as you see we came up with quite a
few songs so if I wanted to listen to
this song right here all I have to do is
select it and play the song and it
begins playing it and you can also go
down here and it will give a radio
station if you look if it wants to play
similar songs you can do that as well so
we can search for another song let's try
a song title by the same group so we're
just going to click here song is called
hello Seattle and we can search for that
song instead of just searching for the
artist and as you see it gives a few
other suggestions if you misspell it or
or whatnot so we can just click here and
play the song and it will begin to load
and as you see or hear these songs gets
two plays so a very great application
probably one of my favorites for any
device is the grooveshark mobile
application and this another Android
Market pick and this is grooveshark
mobile and it is free to download on
Android Market but you will meet a VIP
membership which is either three dollars
a month or thirty dollars a year thanks
for watching and if any time you want to
download this program to your device
just navigate using google goggles to
the image
the QR code on the screen and snap a
