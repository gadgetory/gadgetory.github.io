nine plus has been one of the most
important search terms for the last
couple of months and our review unit is
finally here
reporting from MWC 2018 in Barcelona
I'm hime Italy that I will pocket now
and it's time for an unboxing brought to
you by invisible shield
we've been doing unboxings since the
inception of this YouTube channel really
for a reason that first impression that
first look pretty much defines your
connection to a product just like people
treat you the way they see you in the
same way you'll treat your product as
well as the manufacturer treats you with
how the product is presented and what it
includes the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus
barks follows the same design language
that we've seen for the last three
generations which is great we've got to
cover protecting the goods and showing
off the specific unit you chose
indications - the color variant you
picked in a description of what comes in
the box slide it from the top and you
find Samsung engraving open that flap
and below that we have literature and
under that as your sim ejector tool then
your device is front and center below
and it seems midnight black is gonna be
the way we're gonna play below the
device we have a USB OTG adapter for
Samsung Smart Switch a u.s. fast charger
a USB C cable and a pair of Samsung's
AKG tuned headphones that we've praised
in the past you know gotta love the fact
that Samsung has stuck to this plan of
black accessories and makes it so much
easier to keep them clean and even if
it's kind of noisy here let's remove
this plastic protection oh yeah the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus surely feels as
large as its predecessor but I'm
actually glad that Samsung stuck to its
design language for another year
I mean we've still got competitors
trying to catch up to this design but
hey let us know in the comments what do
you think about samsung's design
language and are you happy that it
continues I personally love these curves
and I noticed that it's actually now a
matte finish on the borders of the
aluminum which is awesome it reminds us
of the s7 now definite fact is that this
glass finish will require some sort of
protection and our sponsor of this video
actually specializes in that here's a
word from them

Galaxy has 9 + &amp;amp; RM WC 2018 videos
