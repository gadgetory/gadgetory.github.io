pocket now calm and in this video we're
gonna talk about the phony experience of
Windows Phone 7 so what happens when you
receive a call what happens when you
want to make a call what happens when
you're on the con you want to do
something else go on the internet check
your email we're going to go through all
of that right now let's get to it now
before getting started once again we
want to mention that this is not final
Windows Phone 7 hardware software in
fact there are some emissions you're
going to see to the phone application
that I'm sure will be addressed in the
final build of Windows Phone 7 so just
keep that in mind we're doing this just
for fun so let's get started I'm going
to call this device right now so you can
see what it's like to receive a call on
a Windows Phone 7 device or at least a
beta of Windows Phone 7 okay so phone
wakes up you get this full screen caller
ID I'm going to slide up and then you
get the two choices answer or ignore I'm
going to choose to answer it so right
now I'm on the call and I get this
little overlay and from this overlay I
can open up the phone dial pad if I want
to maybe press 2 to enter customer
service or whatever I'm doing or I can
press the down arrow which will allow me
to go to speakerphone mode mute hold or
add call now let's say I want to check
my email right now well quite simply you
can go back to the home screen and you
get a notification and at the top that
tells you who you are currently talking
to it also gives you a counter so let's
say I want to go into the Internet and
here I'm on pocketnow.com let's say I
want to end the call or I want to mute
the call if I tap up here what's this
tap to expand you actually get this a
really cool overlay on top of what
you're doing so it's not actually
jumping into the phone application but
it's keeping you in the same application
while giving you an overlay and from
here you get those same options where
you can put it on speaker you can bring
up the dial pad if we go back to the
Start screen and we click on the phone
application that overlay comes on top
again ok so I'm going to end the call
we're going to talk about how to
actually make a call on Windows Phone 7
okay so probably the fastest way to call
somebody in Windows Phone 7 is to pin
favorites to your home screen here and
you can do this with any contact so
presumably you'll have three or four of
your favorite friends listed right on
your home screen and you can see the
pictures show up - quite nicely so let's
say you want to make the cause of
somebody new so you tap on the phone
icon and you're immediately taken to
your call history and what happens in a
very zoom like way tapping on the icon
on the left the little phone icon
will initiate the call immediately one
touch call initiate or he can actually
tap on the person and it will bring up
their information okay so here's my
profile you can you can from here you
can call the person or text message then
it shows the picture caller ID or you
can go down here you can hit the link
button and this will actually link
together certain Facebook contacts with
your people so you can actually do that
within Windows Phone 7 so you can see
their updates right in their contact
card you can see their photo albums and
everything like that I'm not going to
link the context right now you can press
the UP button or you can delete the
contact edit the contact or pin the
contact to your Start screen so I'm
gonna pin and now at the bottom you see
there's one new entry with the picture
caller ID now in this build of Windows
Phone 7 there's no way to do that quick
dial function so if we open up the phone
pad with the button in the center down
here if I start typing say Brandon you
don't get suggestions this is probably
one of the things that will be changed
when the final Windows Phone 7 is
released because this is a really quick
way to dial people and to be nice to
have that option so if we click back we
can do a couple of other things we can
enter the phone book right from this
application and this is the People Hub
actually and from here of course you can
swipe to the right to see people's
updates or go to the left and just
scroll through your contacts and of
course Windows Phone 7 has this ability
to instantly jump through the alphabet
to the people that you want to call
really quick way to not have to type in
the person's name and let us not forget
that you can use the handy-dandy search
button to find a contact while you are
in the contacts
for the phone application so if I hit
contacts and I type Brandon it will
bring up call history or if you are in
your phonebook and you start to type
after you hit the search button it will
search through your context instantly
quite fast too so just another way to to
find a contact within your list another
thing you can do from here is click on
the voicemail icon to call your
voicemail immediately or of course we
already saw that you can go right into
the dialpad
so that was a look at the phone in
Windows Phone 7 when you receive a call
it's very simple you get full screen
beautiful caller ID that takes up pretty
much the entire display you can answer
it or ignore when you're on a call you
can still do other things and you get
that little notification at the top that
actually acts as an overlay on top of
what you're doing and finally to make a
call you can pin people to your Start
screen probably the fastest way to call
people or you can go through your
contacts list although hopefully in the
final version of Windows Phone 7 the
quick dial feature is built-in so that
you can quickly and easily type
somebody's name just by using the keypad
