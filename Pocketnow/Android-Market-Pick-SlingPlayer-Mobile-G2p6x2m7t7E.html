packing.com and today's sling has just
released a slingplayer mobile for
android devices so we're going to take a
look at this application and see how
great it is if you do have a slingbox at
home okay so here we are on the
slingplayer mobile and after you've
input your username and password will
ask you which slingbox you want to
connect to if you have multiple on your
sling account and then all we have to do
this hit connect and my slingbox is
connected to my digital cable box which
also has a DVR and HD encoding so I'm
going to show you a few HD channels as
well as some other channels that you can
get on you know on regular basic cable
or whatnot so we'll just wait for this
to load okay so here we are on a non HD
channel and all his good is hits cause
if I want to cause on my DVR and that's
a cool feature to have on the
slingplayer is to allow you to record
exactly without having to go into the
remote on the older styles so I can play
if I want I can also skip ahead and
fast-forward I can go up to here to my
other channel it's kind of like another
remote control I can go page up page
down if I'm on my guide I'll show you
that in just second I could also click
ok and go left and right and go back so
I can click here and this gives me my
info my record my life and my also my
cancel if I want to I can also cancel
that go here and select channel so let's
see i have a chance Saved here but right
now it's early in the morning so i don't
know what's going to be on this is a HD
channel so click here ok so here you on
the HD channel and as you see it uses
the full screen for this unlike the
windows mobile versions of previous
builds was only used a portion of the
screen this one for android devices use
these the entire screen so you get a
full aspect ratio of wide screen so i
can click on here can also go to
miscellaneous and this gives you a
program guide your DVR your volume up
volume down all these great features
that you have
remote control at home so that's great
if you want to have more access to other
channels and more features on your cable
box or whatever is connected to your
sling just click on the video I can also
click here on these settings and I can
disconnect mute change the devices I
only have one device connected to this
slingbox right now but you can change
devices if you have a blu-ray player or
DVD player or game console or anything
connected to your slingbox so I can also
change the aspect so I can have it at a
regular aspect I can have it fitted so
it will shrink it down to the screen
size I can change it to letter box and a
different sort of other aspect ratio
also so if i go back to menu i can just
select guide and it will give me my
on-screen guy in just a second will load
up here as you see we have the entire
program guide and I can go page down and
of course it is a little delayed because
it does have to send a signal to the
slingbox and also to the device that
it's connected to so you can go page
down again and if I find something
that's interesting I can just select
that and we'll click here okay and then
it will load that HD channel as well i'm
just going to change the aspect ratio
again to the full version so this is
slang player mobile you can find this on
android market for twenty nine dollars
and ninety-nine cents unfortunately
there is no trial available but it is a
great application if you have a slingbox
and you want to play your TV or whatnot
on your android device thanks for
watching and if at any time you want to
download this program to your device

the image of the QR code on the screen
