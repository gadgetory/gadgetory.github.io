here back at Samsung and Aoife day 2 in
Berlin checking out the Galaxy Note 2
again we had a hands-on with this device
yesterday and went through a lot of its
features but we want to sort of compare
and contrast it to the Galaxy s3 this is
an AT&amp;amp;T branded variant I brought with
me from the States but it is identical
to all galaxy s3s physically right next
to the Galaxy Note 2 you can see the
obvious size increase and also a color
difference that we did not immediately
detect still the same kind of faux
brushed metal but this I believe it's
titanium gray is not quite at all and
not quite the same as the deep blue of
the galaxy s3 you can see the
similarities and the camera modules here
similar configurations as far as the
headphone jacks go no stylus obviously
on the s3 volume rocker power button
coming to the galaxy note 2 from a
Galaxy s3 will feel just like coming
home right down to the ripple pattern on
the nature UX so obviously very similar
devices from a manufacturer that prizes
uniformity across its high-end product
line so one of the primary reasons that
the note stands apart from the high-end
standard smartphone like the Galaxy s3
is that S Pen Stylus now if you fire up
s note on the galaxy s3 or rather s memo
excuse me you know you're perfectly free
to write with your finger on the
capacitive screen here but there's no
pressure-sensitive Wacom digitizer or
anything of that sort so you're going to
kind of get this constant pressure of
this thick line on the screen that
doesn't really do a lot and we know that
stylus is tend to be
a bit more specific than that the s-pen
takes it a little bit further see we've
got that air view hovering action going
on but also
you can see pressure sensitivity
variations as I push harder and the
virtual ink seeps into the virtual paper
whereas with softer
you can see a very plain difference
there another thing people have been
asking us are if there are any
improvements to s voice in jelly bean in
the jelly bird version of that's that
the note 2 is running so we're just
going to ask us boys a couple questions
here double tap on both what's the
weather like in Berlin today
these are running on different networks
the galaxy s3 giving us the forecast for
Berlin New Jersey lol
and of course the calyx c-note to
following suit so no improvement in
general awareness of location let's go
ahead and just try and open a nap
open gallery
boom there that is that's Reginald
veljohnson which is awesome and there's
the new gallery in jelly bean that's
great and why don't we try composing a
tweet
tweet IFA is awesome exclamation point
once again this is on HSPA this is on
samsung's Wi-Fi network here at Aoife
looks like I got that understood
perfectly so s-voice does some things
well on the note 2 something's not so
great and that's about on par with our
experience on the galaxy s3 it's one of
the things about the galaxy s3 being a
smaller device than the note 2 that's
convenient is that the keyboard
generally is accessible with one hand if
you have your other hand is busy with
something whereas on the note 2 that is
still sort of the case but really not
not quite so much getting the cue and
the one that's a little bit difficult
and I have medium-sized hands if you
have smaller hands that'll be much more
difficult so Samsung has thoughtfully
included a setting in their stock
keyboard if you jump on into settings
and you can set one-handed operation
right there you check that box jump back
into the keyboard and the keyboard will
favor one side of the screen over the
other so if you're right-handed you set
it over here if you're left-handed you
can set it over there very very handy
for a device of this size so while we're
here we're just gonna hop into the
browser and do a little bit of
comparison while we're talking about
screen size and because these are on
different networks this is not a speed
test necessarily as much as it is an
examination of what the sites look like
on what the same site looks like on a
standard superphone display and on a
standard phablet display a term that
Samsung has recently sort of embraced so
you can see rendering is much much
faster on the note 2 in this
circumstance that doesn't really mean
anything because their test conditions
are not ideal but it certainly is
reflecting what we saw yesterday on the
note 2 with a really nice performance in
the browser from pinch to zoom to scroll
rendering
when you look at this you definitely
have to double tap to get to column view
to actually read the text whereas on the
note 2 you really don't have to it's not
necessarily comfortable to read text
this size but you can do it it is
possible whereas on the s3 it's not
really possible unless you are having
especially acute vision then of course
there are additional enhancements to
Android the jellybean version that the
note 2 is running the gallery app has
been rethought and in addition there
have been some enhancements have been
made to the Galaxy s3 is pop-up Play
version which is still here but only
more so of course on the note 2 with the
resizable window that you can move
around and when you hop back into the
video player
you can use the s-pen and the air view
to hover over points in the timeline
without stopping the video just like on
a flash-based player on a computer or on
YouTube and finally support has been
included this being jellybean once again
for Google now which is not functioning
on the network right now but which is
really handy to have or might prove
itself really handy to have depending on
your tastes

side-by-side comparison the galaxy s3
