pocket now calm and this is the software
review of the motorola droid 2 on
verizon let's get started so the
software on the motorola droid 2 is very
similar to what you get on the droid x
but of course the screen is a lot
smaller on the droid to 3.7 inches
compared to 4.3 now the main difference
between these two devices besides the
form factor is that the joy to is
running android 2.2 and the droid x is
running android 2.1 so in theory the
droid two should be faster at doing
everything launching applications
browsing the web compared to the droid x
because android 2.2 is supposed to be
much faster so in a couple of minutes
we're going to compare the two in
launching applications and browsing the
web and see if that claim holds to be
true okay so let's talk about the droid
2 so obviously we have a slide out
keyboard which means that the home
screen can reorient to the proper
orientation here and quite smoothly and
quickly on my dad so we can go back and
forth and it takes sometimes it takes a
little bit more than a second but most
of the time it happens in about half of
a second and even if you go to a home
screen that is a little bit more
advanced when you slide open the
keyboard it still happens very fast and
it lines up very nicely so that is a
nice thing to have so just like the
droid x you get a choice of seven home
screens to customize and when you swipe
to the right or to the left you get this
quick jump on the bottom that lets you
quickly jump from home screen 12 home
screen 2 and so on and so forth and so
we can add motorola widgets and we can
add stock android widgets i'm going to
take you through some of the motorola
widgets that are included on the droid
two they're very similar to what you get
on the droid x so here we have a simple
clock widget we can actually resize all
of the motorola widgets which is quite
nuts and the function actually changes
sometimes when you resize the widgets
for example here I've changed the clock
widget into a calendar widget just by
changing its size so that's really neat
so you get these handles and you can
make it skinny a little bit wider and
you get the point from there then
just the variety of shortcuts here on
the bottom we have the permanent buttons
we've contacts the application launcher
and the phone over here on the Left
swiping over to the left here we have a
google search bar froyo style and we can
change what we're actually searching
although right now moment have it only
set to google and the web going back we
have a quick link into our calendar down
here we have a messaging application
which will open up a widget not the
actual mail application to let you
quickly preview your email which is nice
and i've got some links on the bottom
scrolling to the left have some quick
toggles for Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and
airplane mode and they're very visual
and they look pretty cool so you swipe
them on and let's see how this one looks
in landscape pretty good the the toggles
actually change design when you go into
landscape and that's happening pretty
fast which is impressive we can go over
here to the weather widget and it's
using GPS to see where I am and tell me
the weather in the location go back this
does have the 3g mobile hotspot
capability like the droid x but
unfortunately you have to pay an extra
twenty dollars a month to get it to work
on top of your data plan so don't expect
to use this as a 3g Wi-Fi hotspot out of
the box although if you root it you may
be able to get away with it so let's go
back okay and on the left we have
nothing so we can add a couple of
widgets just kind of play around here so
we've already seen these two toggles
you've seen the calendar the contact
quick task is really awesome and they
have this on the droid x as well so we
can take a particular contact and we can
assign a quick action to them so for
example we can have a quick action for
text messaging or to email or to call
their home so I'm going to just do
Twitter and you contact detail just to
choose to and then we get these two
little offshoots of the contacts so
imagine having one of your home screens
be assigned to all of your friends and
all of your friends have these two
little dropdowns one for text messaging
and want to call them really awesome way
to kind of group together context and be
able to perform an action on them in a
quick amount of time jump back into the
motorola widgets photo view photo widget
is just a quick little widget
lets you flip through photos I don't
have any gallery set up so can't go
through that we have a picture frame
plus widget which is a little bit more
fancy than what you get with the photo
widget social networking which is cool
ties into multiple services all right
now I only have twitter set up so I can
click done and I can see what's going on
in Twitter if I tap on it it brings up
this little widget I can flick through
all of the different tweets that have
been going on through my account and
just kind of look at look at Twitter in
a quick and easy way let's delete that
there's also of course a widget that
lets you update your twitter or facebook
status right from your home screen
that's called social status we have
something called sticky note which is a
way to remind you to do certain things
which is quite nice and also whether
what you've seen and the Wi-Fi toggle
and one more thing there's a news widget
which will allow you to add custom feeds
so let's say we want to add the RSS from
pocket now calm and by the way we do
have an on-screen keyboard here which is
a pretty good it's it's very much
similar in functionality to the stock
android keyboard you would get on say
the google nexus one but i mean a little
device like this you probably should be
using a slide-out keyboard so it's
trying to find the RSS feed for pocket
now it seems to have found it so I'm
going to click Subscribe and now i will
have the pocket now RSS feed upon my
home screen and I can tap here and swipe
through all of the recent RSS feeds from
today so kind of a cool way to quickly
check on news and see what's going on so
I'm going to delete that and beyond that
you get the other standard standard
Android widgets some of these I've added
like battery widget digital clock so on
and so forth nothing special in the
pulldown notification it's not like the
galaxy s where you can quickly toggle
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from up here but you
get the sort of white style the white
skin some Android phones have a black or
dark gray skin to go with their entire
skin ok so let's talk now about some of
the built-in programs then we're going
to compare launching programs i'm using
the browser with the droid x to see if
froyo has made a difference so let's go
into the application tray and oddly even
though I've turned off animations I
still get an anime
in and out of the application train just
kind of annoying it slows down the
device a little bit so the droid 2 comes
with a blockbuster application of course
you have to pay for that it comes with
city ID a lot of these apps you can get
in the android marketplace but verizon
obviously has some deals with these
these companies like amazon mp3 and down
here with google search gallery which
probably doesn't have any pictures in it
well maybe one can open this picture
this is actually a video that i took
earlier and we'll go over you to play
back in in a couple of minutes we'll
compare that to the droid x and see
which play back a smoother so that is a
big gallery it has DLNA support so you
can play multimedia from your joy to on
through any other DLNA supported device
kindle application is included although
of course that's an android market
application quickoffice is included so
you can view and edit Microsoft Office
documents always nice to have and then
you get the other standard stuff here
that is typical for an android 2.2
device and of course in settings we have
the froyo adjusted settings so now
display and sound are two different
elements not too big of a deal but I'm
just a nice way to separate the two okay
so here now we have the droid x right
next to the droid two and we're going to
do some speed tests I've tried to set up
the home screens as similarly as
possible so if I swipe to the left
you're getting basically the same thing
here let's see how fast things happen
faster on the droid to their simple
operation scroll to the left they
basically seem the same have the same
amount of smoothness maybe the droid 2
is a little bit smoother than the droid
x in this situation let's see how long
it takes to launch the application tray
okay was faster on the droid two so far
so good the droid 2 is definitely
proving to be a little bit faster let's
open up settings okay droid 2 is faster
and opening up settings let's open up
the browser joy to a slightly faster in
that case also so let's go to pocket now
that
over the same Wi-Fi network and let's
see if the droid to froyo browser is
indeed faster now should tell you that I
plugins enabled which means that it's
going to show Flash content whereas the
droid x is not going to so that actually
gives you the droid x an advantage but
out of the box the droid two as plugins
enabled so I'm trying to replicate that
out of box experience so let's see which
is faster so far the droid 2 is smoking
the droid x
actually it looks like the droid x is
droid x 1 very interesting we left the
droid to finish and we're actually going
to turn off plugins in a minute just
want to move around the page so you kind
of get an idea for how smooth they do
that ok so let's pinch and zoom seems a
little bit smoother on the droid x
actually and again I think that's
because the droid 2 is showing Flash
content so real quick i'm going to
disable the plugins the flash content so
that it's more of an even playing field
here ok and now let's go to engadget.com
see which gets there faster now with
plugins disabled got that up there
okay and even with the delay the droid
two still won by it looks like five
seconds so far we're going to get to 10
seconds now so I'll just stop it from
loading so the droid 2 is definitely
faster let's move around on the page
here on the joy to accidentally clicked
on a link and we're going to click on a
permalink at the same time and see which
gets there faster so but a double tap to
zoom in double tap to zoom in and click
these at the same time okay then they're
off and by the way neither device has
any tabs open which could slow down
performance so let's see which works
fastest and the droid x keeps on going
we're gonna have to stop it here let's
go to the sidebar here and tap on
something we'll try one more speed test
I should mention that the droid x on the
droid to have similar hardware inside
they both have a 1 gigahertz texas
instruments omap processor they both
have 512 megabytes of RAM the real big
difference here is of course the
operating system version so let's see
which gets fastest to this page okay the
droid 2 1 living up to its claim to be
faster than android 2.1 in fact
applications loaded faster the
application tray open up quicker let's
just test screen rotation speed just to
see if there's a difference there okay
exactly the same they're exactly the
same so the joy to is faster there are
no big difference in terms of screen
rotation speed and just for good measure
let's jump into YouTube try to do it at
the exact same time so you can get a
sense for how smooth video playback is
compared to these two by two devices and
how fast YouTube actually opens lots of
fingerprints on the screen there so
let's say the joy to was about a half a
second ahead so we're going to tap on
the first video see which buffer is the
first take it from there well that was
unfair because the droid two didn't pick
up that press go back and we'll do this
one
ok so the droid two died in a crafter
and let's just watch video playback for
just a minute sewage cribs and so the
colors are more saturated here on the
joy to and the contrast is also better
but of course you get a bigger screen on
the droid x so this concludes the
software review of the motorola droid 2
for those of you that have the original
droid which had a very much stock
Android installation you may be a little
bit disappointed with the customizations
made to the droid two but personally I
think it's a good thing because you've
got to get a lot of extra widgets you
get a little bit of customization that
makes your android phone feel different
than other android phones out there and
of course we found out that with android
2.2 the droid 2 is significantly faster
than the droid x which has android 2.1
running very similar hardware programs
open faster web pages render quick more
quickly and it's smoother japan and
scroll around on a web page so the droid
2 gets high marks in the software
Department be sure to check pocket now
calm for the four of you or we'll talk
about photo quality camera quality
battery life and more about performance
