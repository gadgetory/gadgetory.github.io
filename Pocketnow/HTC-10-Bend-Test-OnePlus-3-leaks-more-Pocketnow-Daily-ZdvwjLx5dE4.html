with optimism over the 10 lenovo takes a
stab at project tango and we even hear
more about the Moto X 2016 and the one
plus three leaks already show us what to
expect from the hardware I'm high Meadow
Ravenna and tell me what is your
favorite movie of all time in the
comments down below mine was this one
Spaceballs just hands down this is
parking out daily
I always like to begin the day with
deals if you're in the market for a new
smartphone you don't want to buy a
mid-ranger but you want to buy a really
good flagship the g4 continues to be one
of my favorite phones of all time from
LG it's probably still open of the best
cameras out there and it's only $275
from a trusted seller on ebay you can
learn more in the links of the
description and speaking of budget
phones one that we are highly
anticipating is the one plus three for
the oneplus 2 and the 1 plus 1 have been
awesome smartphones for their price tags
even beyond the damn price tag and we
already start hearing more rumors of
what to expect there's this leak back it
seems that they're moving away from
sandstone or that could just be some
sort of sandstone blend that also
includes aluminum stripes it could just
be but it doesn't really matter the one
plus three will be all about its
hardware and price tag doesn't really
matter what the hardware looks like and
the company's always done a really good
job in making it look great but stay
tuned we should learn more soon a
company that is planning to make
something of motorola's lenovo we hear
that there might be some interesting
event happening on jun 9th and it's kind
of confusing because at the same time we
also see that the company is teasing its
project tango smartphone and it doesn't
look like anything horrible that we've
seen before for project tango so that
could mean something even though that's
still a niche but anyways there is a lot
to expect from Lenovo it seems that Jew
is going to be the date set your
calendars I actually had to separate
these news because uh separately from
other sources we have found some leaks
of a probable either moto x or droid
turbo 3 whatever the case may be this is
a completely different design it looks
like Motorola but it does not look like
Motorola we've actually been covering
leaks from that back for a while and we
thought that they were going to make it
to the Moto X 2016 and they didn't
hopefully this does come to the next
Moto X though I'm not gonna say that it
looks great it doesn't look that ugly
though well you tell me in the comments
what you think and finally the very hot
news today well if we could say that
they're hot have to do with the results
of HTC there is a full link of the
script
with details on its quarter results it
wasn't that good 150 million in losses
we've been seeing this trend from HTC
but obviously this quarter doesn't
include the sales for the 10 and it
doesn't include the sales for the vibe
either the company has spun off a couple
of projects that should bring in more
money in the future quarters and the
things are so positive with the HTC 10
that it's probably one of our favorite
phones of the year in addition there are
some tests right now durability tests
for scratch test bend tests on video
showing just how strong this phone is
it's crazy it feels strong when you hold
it and it clearly is strong in these
tests but it leads me to the question of
today how important is smartphone
durability for you when you buy a device
I will admit for me it's everything for
me if the phone feels too fragile or it
feels cheap you just don't enjoy the
experience of holding it and you don't
have peace of mind you're worried about
where you set the phone and everything
which is the thing I didn't like the
most about the iphone 6 and the thing
that I don't have to deal with with the
HTC 10 and other devices I would even
say that devices like the Galaxy s7 edge
make me feel that way but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
