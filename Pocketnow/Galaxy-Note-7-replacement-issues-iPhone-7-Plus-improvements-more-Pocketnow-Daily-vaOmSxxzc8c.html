if the green icon is included iphone 7
plus gets more improvements than just
the protoid photo mode and blackberry is
done making smartphones sort of I'm hi
Mary vera and I explicitly asked for a
kylo Ren costume that look like this and
they told me they didn't have any this
is parking out daily the official lose
today as always begin with deals it
seems a team oval wants to make their
summers endless mainly because the
company had a couple of deals where you
were allowed to travel to certain
countries in South America and in Europe
and you would get high-speed roaming for
free well that's actually going to
extend because apparently t-mobile's
adding more countries and more time you
can learn more about which countries and
how long in the link of the description
other official news are not necessarily
positive if you think of it or they
could be blackberry has just announced
that the company will no longer be
making its own smartphones the company
is going to outsource what they do which
is pretty much what we saw with the
detect if T we already saw the grounders
of the detects 60 which is the idol 4s
with the fingerprint scanner and
everything just seems that the company
wants to work with TCL which is the
parent company of alcatel it makes a lot
of sense i mean those alcatel
smartphones are really cool looking
let's see how that future holds up for
blackberry they're very interesting and
possibly controversial changes have to
do with the Huawei watch too I've
personally been waiting for that update
for a while I love the version one but
seems that version two might not be
running Android wear or at least not all
variants we hear that apparently
Huawei's working with sam singh and
building a Tizen variant of the Huawei
watch too and while I'm not a personal
fan of ties and I know a lot of people
at bar so let's see if that works after
those of you that have been testing iOS
10.1 beta and I cannot wait to join you
haven't been able to because I'm
currently finalizing the review of the
iphone 7 plus we have to use final
software for that but yeah in addition
to getting portrait mode for photos
which is something cool so that's not
the only thing you know that the iphone
7 plus an extra gig of ram
when compared to last year's variants
and also the seven but apparently you
can take advantage of it until now
rumors claim that you can now load mode
applications in RAM which is cool even
though refresh times on iPhones aren't
really that bad let's see what we get in
the end hopefully apple doesn't end up
pulling that plug on that at the end of
the day and finally for the very
interesting news today we hear two
things number one that Samsung is
apparently recalling a few galaxy note 7
units that were already replaced meeting
these are the new phones that it
replaced already over reports of
overheating number two is that
apparently we still have explosions of
the node 7 even with the green icon this
is rather worrisome because we don't
know exactly what the feature of the
node 7 will be if we get more cases of
explosions that is extremely ridiculous
but then again it's something that's
happening we will keep you posted as
soon as we learn more but we would love
to know in the questions of today with
these reports are you still trying to
get a note 7 or are you concerned about
it in my case I still want my node 7 but
hey I will definitely play it by ear
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends in all the
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the videos filmed but was
unpacking out on come and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you can also catch
our videos on vessel vessel that calm /
