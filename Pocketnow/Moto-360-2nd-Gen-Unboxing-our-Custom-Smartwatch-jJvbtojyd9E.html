when it landed in our offices last year
I was away at Aoife and Berlin so that
was handled by Joe Levi unfortunately
Motorola's second generation SmartWatch
comes in much the same packaging so now
I finally get to unbox it I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and here's some
early thoughts on the Moto 360 for 2015
unlike its competitor Huawei Motorola
didn't necessarily strive to redefine
the unboxing experience with its new
SmartWatch but that doesn't mean it's
skimped either the plastic and cardboard
container catches the eye with its
cylindrical design and it does a nice
job of featuring the Moto 360 front and
center braced with packing material that
also snugly accommodates a wall plug and
an included wireless charging pedestal
kudos to moto for retaining this nice
touch most of its competitors have stuck
with far less imaginative Chargers but
she didn't pop open the box to admire
the accessories this is the new Moto 360
and yes it's a bit of a departure from
the last gen model as we discussed in
our show floor comparison from Eva 2015
the buttons bigger the screen is
brighter the back is glass here and of
course dem lugs
as you can see we went with the 46
millimeter version and retrospect I'd
probably have opted for the 42
millimeter version just because I'm
fresh off a week with the Huawei watch
and I tend to prefer a smaller
SmartWatch anyway also we opted to keep
our review device and no frills and went
with the leather band but if I'd had to
order it again
I'd have spent the $50 for the steel
upgrade not that the leather is bad it's
for wien with a newer firmer surface
treatment it's just that the leather
called attention to the lugs while the
metal D emphasizes them and I prefer the
latter
anyway firing up the watch prompts us to
sync with our phone in this case a1 plus
2 but the watch will also work with iOS
and we'll be testing it with a new
iPhone next week my favorite thing so
far the newer bigger button at the 2
o'clock position and not just because
it's got a Motorola logo now it's also
got much improved travel and feedback
you can
really feel it chunk into place when you
press it adding to the already sturdy
feel of this beefy watch it might be a
few days before we're able to get back
to this device so here's some first
impressions if the new moto 360 looks
big on the wrist but it doesn't feel
much different if at all different than
the first edition Android wear works
exactly as it does on any other Google
SmartWatch and while there were a few
hiccups here and there at first I'm
gonna chalk that up to the watch still
syncing apps in the background because
it's been very smooth since yes the flat
tire is still here but that means that
the ambient light sensor is too if you
don't have to babysit the Moto 360s
screen brightness setting I continue to
be disappointed in the decision to go
with an LCD screen over an AMOLED panel
though while the colors are on point the
always-on display just can't get as
bright Wi-Fi usage iPhone syncing heart
rate monitoring quick release bands and
of course battery life that's just a
handful of the stuff we're slated to
cover in our moto 360 second generation
review coming well just as soon as we
can get it to you stay tuned to
pocketnow.com a follow pocket now on the
socials follow me at captain two phones
