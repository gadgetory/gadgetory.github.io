pocket now calm and this is the hardware
review of the Android L venue is like
the venue pro but without the slide-out
keyboard let's get to it so the dell
venue is very much like the dell venue
pro except as mentioned it doesn't have
the slide-out keyboard it has the same
design it's got the same level of build
quality which is extremely high and its
really nice to hold in the hand it's a
little bit heavy and a little bit thick
but it's got a lot of really interesting
design cues for example if you've got
these chrome strips on the side they are
plastic unfortunately and they look
really nice when you turn it over to the
side it's kind of take a tour around the
device this is a four point one inch
AMOLED display and if you compare it to
a Super AMOLED display it doesn't look
that great because Super AMOLED displays
are awesome but if you compare it to an
LCD it looks quite good let me show you
an example of what I mean so let's turn
it on real quick let's take a look at
something that has some black color to
it so let's just open up the calculator
and we've got a super amoled screen here
with the with the Nexus S here and you
can just get a sense for how the blacks
on the Super AMOLED are pretty much
blacker than you get on the amoled here
nevertheless compared to lcds as I
mentioned you get you get really good
contrast on the screen and hey the
display is actually curve just like the
venue pro what this means is for some
reason the screen sensitivity is far
greater than what you'll get on standard
phone so on-screen keyboard typing is a
breeze we're going to talk more about
that in the software review of the venue
in an upcoming video so again this is a
four point one inch diagonal screen it's
800 x 480 resolution oddly the volume
rocker is on the right side of the
device most phones have it on the left
side but we do get this handy-dandy mute
switch which you really don't get to see
these days on smartphones so that's a
nice addition we've got three capacitive
touch android buttons down here home
menu and back they nixed the search
button which is okay kind of keep it
minimal and fresh on the bottom here
we've got a speaker and a microphone the
speakers particularly loud on the bed
on the venue pro here we have Micro USB
for charging and syncing let's turn over
to the back we have a really interesting
texture and if you remember the venue
pro you also got the same kind of
texture which makes it feel very high
quality in hand got an 8 megapixel
camera with flash matted to an awesome
shutter release here a lot of phones
again don't have that dedicated camera
button but it's so handy because it
helps you study the the phone when
you're taking a picture so very welcomed
addition here we've got a nice big dell
logo there 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and the power buttons and the kind of a
strange plays something to get used to
usually it's over here or over here
Dell's trying to be a little bit
different here by putting it on the top
so popping open the back here we get a
battery which is 1400 milliamp hours
we've got a sim card slot here I'm using
a tmobile sim this is a tmobile phone of
course and it actually will work on
their hspa+ network which is fantastic
comes with a 16 gig class for micro SD
card of course you can expand that up to
32 gigabytes now inside you've got a
Qualcomm Snapdragon one gigahertz
processor the same chick found on a lot
of hardware these days you've got 512
megabytes of RAM so it's no slouch it's
a it's a fast device we're going to run
benchmarks on this in the software
review we're going to run quadrant and
compare this to pretty much the fastest
android device out there right now which
is the the Nexus S so overall in terms
of hardware the venue just like the
venue pro gets extremely high marks it's
relatively thin has very high boat had
built build quality and a lot of really
good attention to detail so we've got
chrome strips different textures to
curved glass display great screen
sensitivity and of course the beauty of
a 4.1 inch touchscreen which is always a
nice size because a little bit bigger
than the galaxy s a little bit smaller
than the you know the Evo's out there so
that was the hardware review of the Dell
Venue please thumbs up thumbs up this
video if you liked it and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
