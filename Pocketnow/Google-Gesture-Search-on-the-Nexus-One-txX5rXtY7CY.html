pocketnow.com like to show you in little
app that's free from google called
gesture search now to get this app you
head out to the market and you type in
gesture search search for that and go
ahead and download it you'll come up
with this looks like just plain blank
screen nice thing about this is it's a
free forum search box if you will to run
it you simply tap on the home screen
icon which it will ask if you want to
install and then from there you can hand
write on the screen search for almost
anything you want let's search for a
song I've got on here by the northern
Kings so we'll write n o R T and you can
already see it's starting to pare down
the information on my phone I've got
some stuff in here with spare parts and
wired tether stuff that matches that
that search string just a little bit but
up here at the top my first three hits
our northern Kings Radiohead northern
Kings don't stop believin and northern
Kings I just died in your arms tonight i
think is the name of that song so i can
play any of those really easily so let's
go back search for something else let's
say i want to send a message to brandon
minimun from pocket now I'll write up B
R a n D oh and I've got a Brandon in
here but that's not Brandon minimun I
don't want to show you his home address
or phone number or whatnot so this is
just some other Brandon that I've made
up let's go back again and let's search
now for I don't know let's search for me
J oh now you notice i didn't start over
so it's just gone ahead and put the
whole string together n 0 RT j 0
that's not what I'm after so let's go
back start a clean slate and search
again J 0 e there i am first result not
a problem neat little search tool I
don't know how useful it is you've got
to tap and then go into it but it's a
quick way to search for all kinds of
stuff even if you don't have microphone
capability at the time if you can't do a
speech search using the built-in google
search for example it's kind of nice to
be able to search really quickly just by
scribbling it out with your finger show
you how this is let's go back and search
jolie by using the quick search Joe Levi
and then right here you see it's got
called yo Levi search for Joe Levi all
kinds of cool stuff so is it more useful
than the built-in search maybe maybe not
let's go ahead and search in here see
what it comes up with just in case you
don't like to use voice search go ahead
and look that up this does a web search
so yes it comes up with different
results kind of nice go ahead and give
it a try it's free from the marketplace
you can excuse me the android market we
can't get our markets confused now can
we but you can find it really easily
just go out to the market and we want to
search for gesture search for that and
you can tell google gesture search right
there easy to download it's got
relatively high reviews and a couple of
really low ones this worked just fine on
my Nexus One it works very well on a GU
room one running cyanogenmod so go out
and give it a try I'm really curious to
see what you think about it so please if
you like it thumb up this video I
mentioned in comments retweet it all
over the internet and of course leave
comments on the pocket now article so
showing you Google's gesture search I am
