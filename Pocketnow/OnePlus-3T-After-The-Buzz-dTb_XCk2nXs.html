story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the bus behind that new tool you
might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as important as the moment you
unbox your product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
expensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's have a second look at version 2 of
the world's favorite flagship killer
I'm hai medley that it would pocket now
and this is the one plus 3t act the buzz
at the time of or one plus three after
the buzz we still haven't really seen
what 2017 had to offer today nearly six
months later it turns out that black
ships have changed and they've changed a
lot this place have gotten taller bezels
have been reduced glass has become
predominant you could say that the 1
plus 3t was made obsolete from a sheer
design standpoint but not so fast I
still prefer aluminum over glass in the
long run you don't have to worry about
the back of her breaking on a fall or
keep your phone smudge free the sheet of
aluminum has handled use very well and
these 1 plus back plates look pretty
much like if they were brand new say
from a few scratches on a display from
your average wear and tear I'd say that
this phone looks pretty much brand new
the same goes for internal to the
snapdragon each one has really aged well
up to the point where it powers newer
flagships like the LGG six and this
phone is the only way to get sixty good
bytes of ram and even dual-sim
capabilities without having to go buy
one of those special edition versions of
whatever flag shipped really if it
wasn't for the lack of IP 6pa water and
does resistance this phone has nearly
everything you need it also continues to
be a device that won praise for its
performance and audio and i'm really in
love with simple little things like the
audio toggle switch i can't stress
enough how delighted I am every time
that I have to go back to this phone it
pretty much nails a ton of the basics
just right oh and remember that one plus
that was always late to software updates
yeah you can scratch that out the one
plus three T was one of the first
devices to gain Android 7.1.1 and the
fact that oxygen OS is near stock
experience is really code for delight
I'm still in love with the simple way
that you can set extra shortcuts for the
navigation buttons and that you can also
turn these into soft keys whenever you
want to oneplus is seriously a be tansy
and how software should age over time
and yes I have been approached
continuously about the touch latency
issues and honestly I wish I could
report on them but as it stands this is
our second one plus three T review unit
and then we also had the oneplus three
and I can't really say that I've ever
noticed any lesser performance over
competitors this phone is buttery smooth
and day-to-day tasks and when it comes
to games there is really nothing to
complain about it I'm not going to call
my experience with battery life to be
disappointing but I was expecting the
latest version of Android to do some
extra magic you will get through the day
without a problem but all I can say is
that the battery is about the same as
when we review the phone back in
November
now what's definitely not average over
time is this camera so I'm not exactly
sure what oneplus has done silently to
improve the low-light performance on
this phone but I am very impressed no
it's not at the level of an LG g6 but
there is clearly some new processing
happening over in the background because
it produces far better detail than
before making it a decent contender for
camera whenever you need it again and
this is all considering low-light
obviously for daylight shots this phone
does the trick and then when it comes to
video recording yes this phone is also
an obvious really good contender when
compared to everything else
overall at $439 the one plus 3t
continues to be the most bang for your
buck that you'll be able to find there
is simply no other film that balances
this much power and this much delight on
such an elegant and practical design and
fits this crazy price tag that may lack
the slim bezels or the tall aspect ratio
and yes we would love water resistance
but it nails every single other basic
very well sure we know the one plus five
is just a few days away and the purpose
of this video is mainly because once
this other device launches the one plus
3t will most likely become even less
expensive would we recommend this device
after the buzz absolutely this is one of
those cases where we're very sure that
you will not be disappointed even today
