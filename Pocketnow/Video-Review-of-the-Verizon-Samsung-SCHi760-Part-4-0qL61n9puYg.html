pocketnow.com this is part 4 of the
video review of the verizon samsung i760
i had intended on discussing the
included software in part 4 however
there have been enough review requests
that i will address some of them in
today's video the two requests that I'm
going to look at today are call quality
and YouTube let's take a look at sound
quality I find the the audio to be a
little tinny in comparison to my
t-mobile wing but it's really not that
bad so I thought what I would do to
demonstrate this is I access the
voicemail so we'll go ahead and make the
call to voicemail and then I will place
it so we'll enter the password not
everybody knows it try to get in here
you have one saved boys message to
listen to your messages press one to
send a message press two to change your
personal option press 42 just that
Prescott as you can see the the audio is
fine there's no real issue it's a little
bit on the high end and the speakerphone
actually works quite well from that
aspect so unless you're very sensitive
to high frequencies I don't think the
call quality will bother you now let's
talk about YouTube as most windows
mobile users know youtube videos will
not play out of the box however the guys
over at windows mobile experts have
developed a plugin for the open source
TCP MP mobile player and once that's
installed you can actually use the
desktop
version of the YouTube website to get
videos to play so why don't I bring up
Internet Explorer here
and we're connecting and opening the
default web page I'll click on YouTube
now what happens is YouTube knows that
this is a mobile device and will go
directly to its mobile web site but its
mobile website won't work because it
tries to launch Windows Mobile player
you actually have to go to the bottom of
the page and go to the classic view
which is the desktop version of the
YouTube website and once that loads we
can go and click on the first video and
the new menu pops up you can say play
video this will launch the TCP NP on
media player and the video will launch
shortly here you go
november six so we can also go to full
screen mode on the side so you can see
that it works quite well especially with
the evdo broadband capabilities on the
verizon network so that's it for today's
video tomorrow i'll be back to discuss
and show the cameras picture quality as
well as how fast the screen rotation is
in comparison to other devices like the
t-mobile Wayne</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
