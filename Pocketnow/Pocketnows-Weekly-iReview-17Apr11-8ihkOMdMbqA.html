its way to an iPhone near you apples to
sell the square credit card service to
anyone at Apple stores and Apple now
facing a lawsuit over in-app purchases
to minors all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi Mary
vet and welcome to the pocket nail I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
as skeptical as the media has been the
gree Electronics is somehow figured out
how to unlock any iphone on any carrier
using your imei code or email there's
pretty much the same way you unlock any
other smartphone in the market and even
feature phones and it just works it
leaves your phone factory unlocked we
have a hands-on video showing you not
only that it works but we also show you
that we updated our phone to our latest
iOS version and that it still
permanently unlocks your phone now our
video also shows you why you should
really consider considering that things
are really becoming difficult for you to
have your phone unlocked white iphone 4
rumors keep coming up strong this time
spring is still being mentioned but a
lot of noise is out there about verizon
getting the white iphone 4 now if only
Apple would bring a specific day to that
spring I would probably not have this
sarcastic look on my face saying yeah
I'll believe it when I see it one really
cool surprise this week is seeing that
the square credit card reader is now
being sold on Apple stores online and
that it will eventually be sold on Apple
stores nationwide now squares that
little credit card reader that allows
you to pretty much swipe a credit card
and charged anybody on your iPhone for
ipod touch 4th generation and ipad now
the service the little device will cost
you ten bucks but then you'll get a ten
dollar credit so it's pretty much free
and then you'll only be billed to point
seventy five percent per every
transaction now that's really cool
considering how difficult it was for you
to become a merchant years ago and how
easy squares making things happen well
iOS 4.3 point2 has just been released
out of the blue which is four point two
point seven for risin customers nothing
really big to report it's only a couple
of bug fixes and security exploit
closures to iOS device
now I really wish that Apple wouldn't
have to update the whole West for is
just a little buck closure but it's the
way it is now the cool thing is that the
gel brakes are still working tether for
now but the dev team has confirmed that
the exploit that allows untether
jailbreak still works and then it's just
a matter of time before they update
their tools to bring you another
jailbreaks the iOS 4.3 point two or four
point two point seven well if you
remember the rumors of the smart bezel
that we talked about last week rumors
are still strong but the interesting
thing is that it seems that Apple is
also patenting that the iOS 4.3 gestures
that we saw on the beta will make it to
iOS 5 in a really big and new way not
just the fourth thing in gestures five
finger gestures that we saw it seems
that the smart bezel is designed to work
with these new smart gestures and that
we should expect that to be the really
new thing on iOS 5 well that doesn't for
the cool that's continuing on with the
not so cool a man from Pennsylvania is
filing a lawsuit against apple for
unlawful exploitation of children kind
of big words if you asked me but it
seems that the argument from this guy is
that it's really easy for you to have
in-app purchases within iOS devices
Apple closed a lot of gaps there by
making you have to add your password for
every and have purchased recently on iOS
4.3 but it seems that the guy's not
really happy there because he says that
then children can know the passwords you
know that if you're a chill if you're a
child from 13 years old and up where you
can have an itunes account so it's
really easy but then again you know i
tell you my friend how about if you go
into settings and then look for parental
controls and then deactivate the app
store so that children cannot buy
applications and therefore not buy in
app purchases and then you knock
yourself out with that because most
likely you're not going to make it there
big rumors have apple pushing their iOS
5 or next generation iOS release to june
instead of april and their iphone 5 or
next-generation iphone release to
September though there are another batch
of rumors out there saying that apple
will release him on time now Apple's
been really good at keeping up with
their yearly cycles of I
phone ipod touch an iOS releases so we
really don't know if to give it much
importance or not but then again we also
could use the white iphone for release
as a thermometer and say yeah wait a
second they haven't released a white
iphone 4 anyways so really not know what
to expect now the ultrasnow carrier
unlock has just been updated to iOS 4.3
point one but well iOS 4.3 point 2 was
released eventually and remember this is
the not so cool section what's uncool
here is that sadly that iOS 4.3 point
one update is just compatibility updates
to allow old base bands and ultrasnow to
work with iOS 4.3 point 1 and that's
pretty much it this is not a really a
new unlock so for those of you on the
list they're still waiting for ultrasnow
to be updated for your base bands i'm
officially off that list of people that
are waiting I one with an agree
electronics option sorry guys that's it
for today show thank you very much for
watching remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
