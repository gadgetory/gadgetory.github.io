internals are what you're looking for in
your next smartphone two devices just
landed at Aoife 2014 that are bound to
catch your eye
our michael fisher with pocket now join
us for a quick show floor comparison of
the galaxy note 4 and the huawei ascend
mate 7 each of these is writing on
xtreme screen size as a differentiator
with huawei's 6 inch IPS panel edging
out Samsung's by a third of an inch
resolution is much higher on the samsung
device though with its quad HD Super
AMOLED screen also producing higher
saturation and incorporating a digitizer
for its S Pen Stylus Samsung also sports
a wider range of brightness settings so
it's the more versatile panel overall
it's not as much of a slam-dunk in terms
of the build quality with good news on
both sides Samsung's introduction of
metal has done a lot for the new notes
look and feel and Huawei's use of a full
aluminum back has done the same it's too
early to say which will hold up better
over time but our early money is on the
note with its soft leather at backing
either way these each feel really good
in the hand on software there's a lot to
see on each but the winner for novelty
points at least for this American
reviewer is Huawei Samsung is kind of
bringing the same old thing with
TouchWiz only tweaking a few of its
interface elements from what we're used
to
well Huawei has almost totally revamped
its emotion UI on the mate7
giving us a much more modern look and
feel and if you don't like it you can
swap it out with any of a number of
themes available the note 4 brings a lot
of added utility with its multi window
support making great use of the added
screen real estate
and while the mate7 brings a few tricks
of its own we still think Samsung edges
it out for cheer utility there are far
too many differences in the hardware and
feature sets to include them all but
highlights include a 13 megapixel camera
on the ascend and an optically
stabilized 16 megapixel shooter on the
note custom made chipsets driving each a
fingerprint scanner that's much easier
to use and more reliable on the ascend
than on the note and of course the
ascend mates huge 4100 milliamp hour
battery almost
third larger than the notes it's tough
to say which one will eventually come
out on top in our full comparison but
these are both very compelling devices
if you're shopping for a long-lasting
big-screen er which one would you choose
let us know in the comments below and
stay tuned for much more coverage from
Aoife 2014 in Berlin from PocketNow
until next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow with taylor martin
on the camera stay with us and we'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
