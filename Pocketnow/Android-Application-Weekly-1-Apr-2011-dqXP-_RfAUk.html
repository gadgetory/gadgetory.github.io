overcame this is another episode of the
android application weekly in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started this
application is called DJ studio and
there are two versions available a demo
version and a paid version which costs
about five dollars and twenty-five cents
so what this allows you to do is to mix
mayor various tracks of music and you
can also record it and save it so here I
have a couple tracks and if I want you
just begin playing this one and I can go
here and I can sync them together yes I
can scratch I can also add effects
whiteboard is a free and paid widget
based application allows you to save
notes directly on to your home screen so
i'll just type a note i can add them
alarm down here i can also record a note
if I like I can record a message and I
can also save it as an archive so the
cool thing about this is it does save it
directly on here and let's say they
don't want to change this I will just
move that down will go to this a quick
color I'll choose something red would
say at 5pm or something like that and
I've just click home and it will be on
my home screen join me is a free
application in service by logmein com
what this allows you to do is to view
your friends or your co-workers or
whoever the screen on your android
device so let's rotate it here so as you
can see I can view the screen I can't
really do anything to it like a remote
desktop but if i was going to share
files let's see here if I wanted to go
to microsoft word on my computer and it
will come directly on to my android
device so this is great for meetings you
can also go down here and you can send
messages and even call to set up a
meeting over the phone pic please is a
free application available on android
market that allows you to share your
photos across multiple social networks
you can also view a interesting photos
so let's just click here and it give you
some interesting photos i can save them
as my wallpaper if it like i need to go
to activity and view what others have
posted so i can just go back thank you
notes view my profile go to gallery and
also start the camera in which I can
pictures I used vignettes for my photos
on this device so you take pictures and
share them directly over the pic please
application secret spy cam is a paid and
demo application so what this
application allows you to do is to turn
your Android device into a spy cam that
activates with motions so all I do is
set it up and hit the play button and
then if motion is detected behind the
camera it will begin recording and save
an image directly onto the device so it
shows that motion detection started so
it will record an image and I can just
go back and now I can also view the
images and here is a previous image from
earlier in the day so this has been
another episode of the android
application weekly if you like our

Android Market a free version which
doesn't allow you to change many
settings in a paid version which costs
about 99 cents so you can also activate
the live wallpaper by touching and
moving these little flower petals around

these applications just follow the link

knives website where we stored the QR
codes which you can just snap a picture
