taking a second stab at delivering a
flagship Xperia for 2016 the acts
performance left us underwhelmed so
let's see if the xperia x Z can at least
get us up to whelmed if not excited
first for you Hardware junkie you can
pause the video now to see what the XE
is packing and getting that out of the
way Sony's made another attractive slab
of a phone here new for the XE some
gentle curves around corners and edges
it's softer for Sony but still
represents one of the more modern and
sharp edged looks for any current
smartphone as someone with smaller hands
it's always nice picking up a premium
device with a medium sized screen though
taller forehead and chin bezels keep it
from feeling petite this phone feels
better pieced together than our X
performance review unit but there are
still a lot of seams for a unibody
device backplate edges we're assuming
radio antennas probably live down here
this 5.2 inch LCD isn't one of the
brighter displays we've reviewed and
resolution is only clocking in at 1080p
again Full HD is perfectly usable but at
this price point the XV is battling
brighter higher resolution displays from
many competitors we also have to address
the fingerprint issue in the United
States the scanner hardware is included
but it's software disabled for those
heavier members of our audience you can
flash different software to activate it
but this is not something we think users
should have to perform to correct Sony's
issues so as far as we're concerned for
this review this phone doesn't have a
fingerprint scanner this is the first
Xperia SP type-c connector though which
we're happy to see it's maybe a bit
embarrassing how quickly I've gotten
spoiled by a symmetrical connector and
how cranky I get these days when I need
to track down a microUSB cable some of
this layout is just a bit funky compared
to what most people might be used to
like the really low mounted volume
rocker or the front-facing NFC yeah I
left the sticker on on the last Xperia
we reviewed I kept forgetting it was
here it'll be familiar to the Sony
faithful though and will always be fans
of hardware camera shutter buttons now
moving to software Sony's custom UI
touches are subtle we're mostly stock
adjacent here some extra organization
options in
app drawer a more colorful Settings menu
and some custom Sony services
pre-installed though at the end of the
year we have been spoiled by recent
experiences with Android 7 nougat where
the x/z is still on marshmallow so we're
hoping this phone gets updated soon it
is a snappy performer sliding through
the user interface no surprises there
with a Qualcomm 820 chipset onboard it's
not going to take any performance crowns
but it's a more than capable daily
driver this is well understood hardware
and for most titles the phone performs
well but looking at a game like future
fight which isn't particularly well
optimised for Android we're definitely
seeing stutters and dropped frames Wi-Fi
performance is leaner than several of
the metal back phones we've recently
reviewed falling behind the LGV 20 and
Huawei mate 9 this phone struggles to
reach my router at the edges of my Wi-Fi
reception LTE performance is similar
falling behind our galaxy s7 and mate 9
on ET and just edging out the HTC 10
it's not poor performance but it's not
the best speaker performance is solid
though Sony's been turning out
competitive phone speakers for years and
the XE continues to represent well
against other stereo solutions
especially considering this is a
water-resistant device the headphone
story though still isn't much improved
from the X performance these quality
numbers are hovering nearly identically
with the galaxy s7 it's a somewhat weak
amp with mid-pack noise floor and
dynamic range performance we don't hear
anything here to suggest that Sony will
be improving their audiophile reputation
anytime soon and we've got numerous
requests to produce a real camera review
but even for the additional sensors we
just don't see where this is
significantly different than what we
experienced with the xperia x and x
performance where we do see improvements
the focusing system is far less
confrontational and the newer object
tracking really does help you stay
locked onto your subject we're happy to
see a better layout for manual options
this is usable now and really comes in
handy when auto modes let you down and
4k video recording returns which was a
horrible oversight for the X performance
still for having some of the best camera
Hardware we've ever seen sony software
leaves a lot to be desired
moving between modes is painfully slow
and often you tap or swipe with zero
response or enough of a delay that you
go to rese wipe in the camera skips the
mode you want intelligent auto mode
regularly misses the exposure which
would best fit your subject and you
still feel like you're fighting this app
more than using it to actually create
something if you're going to rely mostly
on auto camera modes this shooter has a
tough time competing against the iPhone
in the pixel video can be captured in a
higher resolution but in 4k mode you
can't focus it's all full auto and why
is the 4k mode a separate internal app
from the rest of the camera why can't I
just change the resolution in the video
settings whoo the image stabilization
doesn't seem to be much improved either
when trying to hold still using the
intelligent stabilization there's still
a lot of twitch and we just can't ignore
that experien hot after recording seven
minutes of HD video in an
air-conditioned room
we got an overheating warning telling us
that features were being disabled now
we've linked our xperia x performance
camera review in the description below
for folks who want to dig deeper but
somebody probably won't be topping our
list of best cameras for 2016 using a
slightly smaller 2,900 milliamp hour
capacity we wouldn't be surprised to see
leaner performance but the X Z runs
really lean with moderate use on our
media test streaming 30 minutes of HD
video over Wi-Fi at 190 Lux we drained
9% of this battery one of the poorer
performers we've run this year and that
is reflected in daily use where it was
difficult making it to dinnertime
without a recharge a shooting some
camera samples drained this phone
significantly faster the recharge story
is also a bit disappointing 30 minutes
on a sony charger resulted in a 22% top
off certainly not the speediest you can
get a little jump from a short stint
plugged in but for a slightly smaller
battery we were hoping to see faster
charging to compensate so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us with
the Sony Xperia XE judged by our
previous experiences with Sony this year
this is a significant improvement this
feels a lot more like a proper flagship
and a truer successor
the Xperia Z it also seems like Sony is
reacting to the market a bit more
aggressively cutting the price of this
phone unlocked to 599 dollars it's still
an expensive device which rightfully has
difficulties competing directly against
HTC 10's Galaxy s7 s after recent price
drops but will still call this progress
ultimately weighing what this phone has
to offer in this tier it's still a
tricky recommendation we think this will
play better with Xperia Z fans looking
to upgrade and stay under the Sony
umbrella but folks coming from other
manufacturers well there might be better
options for your cash as always thanks
