android smartphone this spring there's
no shortage of options but in the United
States at least there's no fiercer
retail rivalry than that of HTC and
Samsung they play in the same space they
release on the same schedule and they
compete for the same pocket yours find
out which one deserves your dollars in
Samsung Galaxy s6 vs. HTC One m9 brought
to you by Squarespace
for the past three years HTC has spanked
Samsung in our opening category Hardware
fit and finish from special
polycarbonate to aluminum unibody the
taiwanese company has always placed a
premium on how a device looks and feels
while samsung has traditionally been
content to iterate slowly on the same
basic design this year though the roles
are reversed HTC is now the more
conservative contender while Samsung is
the bold reinvent er and with that
turning of the tables the company's
respective Android flagships are now
closer to parity that's not to say
they're the same while each is
attractive in its own way they're still
about as different as can be
HTC retains its all-aluminum approach
with the one m9 this year incorporating
sharp edges double anodization and a
dual tone finish to make the heavy and
thick handset more evocative of a
refined wristwatch meanwhile Samsung
goes in a completely different direction
with the s6 whose glass sandwich
construction is much smoother and
rounder it's also lighter and thinner in
the hand and in the pocket but thanks to
its metal mid plate it's subtle chamfers
and whatever coating they're using on
that Gorilla Glass 4 it doesn't look or
feel any less premium the Samsung design
is also the easier one from a control
standpoint it sensibly divides power and
volume buttons across two sides of the
chassis and it makes the neighboring SIM
slot perfectly flush HTC crowds all its
buttons onto one side rail along with
the memory card slot that sort of feels
like a button that makes it harder to
discern the m9 s keys by touch and
they're also not as satisfying and
traveler feedback as Samsung's
speaking of buttons Samsung incorporates
a new and very accurate fingerprint
sensor into its physical home key that
particular bit of biometrics is absent
from the one m9 as is Samsung's now
expected heart rate and blood oxygen
sensor rounding out Samsung's Hardware
advantage is its absurdly high
resolution display it's got over a
hundred more pixels every inch than the
one m9 but that resolution advantage is
overkill and you're not likely to notice
it unless you're looking for it or
you're using Samsung's gear VR headset
the real edge Samsung's screen offers is
its Super AMOLED technology which brings
darker blacks deeper colors and a
broader range of brightness settings
Samsung's lead is less pronounced in
software I still find HTC Sense better
looking than the skin formerly known as
Samsung TouchWiz out of the box
HTC seems to have a keener eye for
modern design and Samsung still hasn't
been able to fully divorce itself from
its cartoony roots HTC Sense 7 is also
highly customizable it's soft keys can
be changed up on the fly for easier
one-handed shortcuts and there's a much
more robust theming engine now you can
make sense look like pretty much
anything you want right down to
customizing your typefaces or creating a
theme from a photo or from scratch
Samsung's themes are cool too but
they're essentially untreatable until
the company releases the api's at the
moment you're limited to just a handful
of prefab themes and you have to pay for
most font downloads back on the stock
stuff Samsung's Flipboard powered
Magazine is slick and more responsive
than ever but it doesn't have the
personalization power of HTC blinkfeed
which does a better job integrating
social accounts still HTC's lead and
software is now much narrower Samsung's
UI is very fast on the s6 also it lets
you run two apps side-by-side something
HTC has yet to duplicate the Samsung
camera shortcut is much more reliable
than HTC's cumbersome motion based
trigger just a double click on the HOME
key then that too is very fast system
sounds change based on the theme and
they're all much better than the water
droplet effects of years past and the
themes themselves
at least a handful available as of now
seem to do a better job of unifying icon
packs and accent colors HTC hasn't won a
camera shootout with Samsung in quite a
while and well this year is no exception
to begin with these sensors turn out
remarkably similar results outdoors in
bright sunlight with the m9 showing a
slight tendency toward warmer or
yellower tones the s6 renders more
balanced color and generally brings more
contrast if you can't catch those
differences then try keeping an eye out
for changes in brightness HTC almost
always airs on the brighter side washing
out some of the shadow that could make
this shot a little more dramatic in
photos with direct sunlight this leaning
toward luminosity sometimes results in
blown out whites on the m9 and the m9
also produces noisier photos on the
whole note the more visible grain in the
blue sky here and speaking of blue the
galaxy s6 slightly emphasizes that color
in much of its output while the m9
sometimes straight-up dismisses it in
this side-by-side comparison the galaxy
s6 gets far closer to replicating the
actual color of the Coldharbour water as
I remember it come back to more neutral
colors and the comparison comes back
toward neutral to neither phone seems to
have any trouble with macro photography
as the tiny hair sticking up from this
pewter statue will attest switch over to
HDR and you'll find that HTC brings more
light out of the shadows as it did in
our m9 vs. iPhone 6 comparison but
notice that the m9 s photos also wash
out more resulting in a duller debtor
photo samsung does a better job of
preserving the scenes color contrast and
texture as the sun goes down the
differences are magnified the m9 starts
skewing even warmer as the light goes
away and gets more sensitive on the
exposure settings as well while the s6
can usually find a nice mid point the m9
still tends to jump between over and
under exposure depending on where you
put the focus reticle
pet indoors and the differences jump off
the screen the galaxy isn't immune to
digital noise but the m9s pictures are
defined by it and the farther away you
get from your subject the worse off you
are the m9s resolution advantage might
work for it on the spec sheet but the
galaxy's optical image stabilization and
larger aperture make it the phone to
pick if you're a night owl
the Samsung is also the better choice if
you're a video taker though here it's
for a different reason
focus problems as the camera moves the
s6 cleanly transitions between distant
and close objects moving or still and
it's smoothly ramps exposure up or down
as needed
by contrast the m9 is constantly
readjusting its focus in jarring jumps
as the camera pans and the impact on
detail is obvious pair that with the
hardware stabilization on the s6 and
you've got a clear winner in the
camcorder department as well the only
place the one m9 really gets a leg up on
the s6 is in the ultra pixel front
facing camera but even here the lead
isn't as pronounced as it once was in
exchange for that low-light boost you
get a fuzzier shot with a pinkish hue
hardly ideal the one m9 is much more
notable for its camera software which is
a little clunkier but also many times
more fun than Samsung's viewfinder with
the best suite of out of box effects and
filters we've seen anywhere the m9 also
features a full suite of manual controls
and upcoming support for raw image files
so standing alone it's not a write-off
by any means
especially if most of your photos go
through Twitter or Instagram filters
anyway but up against the galaxy s6 well
I know what camera I'd choose much has
been made of the difference in
processors between these phones and from
a strategic standpoint that makes sense
it's notable that Samsung has opted to
go with its own silicon for the entire
galaxy s6 lineup but for the vast
majority of folks more concerned with
how the phone's function on a day to day
basis none of that matters because they
perform almost identically each is
snappy and responsive as mentioned
earlier but each may also bog down after
few days of uptime lag like this is
common to most Android 5 devices but out
of the box these two do an excellent job
of minimizing it and yes
each heats up with extended use on
phones this slim no processor is immune
to thermal effects fortunately neither
one gets hot enough to affect
performance in even the most demanding
games play those games long enough and
you'll see battery life crater on each
one
neither phone is an endurance champion
but if I were often stuck away from an
outlet I'd go for the HTC it's battery
is bigger and in daily use I find it
lasts about 20% longer than the s6 even
though our European m9 unit is not
optimized for us networks and our
t-mobile s6 is then again the s6 has
wireless charging so if you've invested
in wireless chargers for a previous
phone or you've got one of those fancy
Starbucks nearby that's something to
consider as well finally how about media
consumption well with its micro SD card
slot capable of a theoretical 2
terabytes of expanded storage the m9
does a better job of preserving what
used to be a staple of Android phones
extensibility and whether you're using
that storage for video or music the m9
is the better device to consume it the
front firing speakers with Dolby
Surround make for a more dynamic
unplugged experience and the boom sound
software enhancements carry that over to
the ear buds as well in the end though
you're going to have to care an awful
lot about that audio superiority or
expandable storage to pick the m9 over
the s6 sure there's the question of
aluminum versus glass - and some might
like sense so much or hate TouchWiz so
much that the one is the only way to go
here but it seems safe to say those
folks will be in the minority in the
past samsung has relied mainly on its
massive marketing resources to shoulder
HTC aside despite the latter often
having the superior product with this
generation that reality changes Samsung
has finally started listening to its
audience and the result is the company's
most competitive smartphone ever against
HTC is much less significant iteration
the galaxy s6 probably
won't have any trouble stealing the
spotlight when it goes on sale on April
10th and this time the victory will be
mostly deserved this comparison was
