iPhone 11 max and it seems that it's
going to catch up in some departments
google is trying to lift where OS by
buying a big part of fossils
intellectual property and it looks like
we should expect the pixel for with no
horrible knotch
I'm Jaime Rivera and well definitely
it's great to say that it's Friday this
is actually a Friday I'm going to
celebrate this is probably now Daley
sponsored by swap on the official news
today begin with unrecognizable deals as
it seems that Cupertino has either
smelled the coffee or they're dealing
with something with Best Buy cuz we've
got $150 off when it comes to the new
MacBook Air for example the one that
just launched that was too overpriced
which is totally true and then if you've
do trade-ins you get obviously a lot
more money that could bring you a gift
card that goes up to 400 bucks and stuff
like that there are so many deals that
I'm not gonna bore you follow the link
in the description now let's talk about
Xiaomi as a the company just reportedly
started working on a new technology that
will allow fingerprint scanners to
become larger on the display obviously
oneplus and while we have done a
tremendous job in this but we can't deny
that it's really hard to get that
specific spot where the fingerprint
scanner is certain time so yeah the
sensor is getting larger we just don't
know when we're getting the technology
now let's talk about the feature of
pixels as a there are some new pens from
Google regarding the design of the
future pixel and it seems that the back
is not really gonna change much was just
fine the front is the one that we wanted
to change it apparently it's going to go
bezel as' is that going to happen or not
it's hard to tell but hopefully that's
going to be for the following pixels I
do believe that the company finally
heard what we thought about their pixel
3xl and speaking of Google the company
just made this very interesting move
they just bought 40 million dollars
worth of intellectual property from
fossil for everything that they've done
for where OS and I feel that the company
that's pushing where OS the most right
now is fossil I be we've got so many
brands I'm currently using a fossil
right now I really like this watch and
the company was one of the first to
bring us a snapdragon we're thirty
100 processor in a watch and so on and
so forth Google is even bringing in some
of their employees fossil will continue
their designs will continue but I like
the fact that Google is wanting to take
where OS to the next level by bringing
some experts and how to do it right
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the iPhone 11 and I presume
this is the max we've got the Wall
Street Journal claiming a couple of
things the first one of the batteries
getting larger 4,000 milliamp hours
finally though we get a fast charger in
the box 15 watts I don't consider that
fast but fine that's gonna work fine for
me but then we talked about the cameras
and we hear a super wide angle a wide
angle which is the regular one that we
currently know of and then a 3x
telephoto if that doesn't sound like the
made 20 pro or the p20 pro I don't know
what is but let us know in the comments
down below what do you think I think do
you think that Apple should bring these
changes to the next iPhone or do you
think that that's not gonna be enough
cuz in my case I feel that it's great
that they're bringing these but how
about if they bring a better price tag
Apple needs to work on that part leave
us a comment down below would love to
know your opinion and friends again
