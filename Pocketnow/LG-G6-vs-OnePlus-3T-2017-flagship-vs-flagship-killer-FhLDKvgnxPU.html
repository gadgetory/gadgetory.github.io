making almost every flagship looked bad
in 2016 but the question is if it still
has enough to battle the new trends of
2017 I'm how you might've even I would
pocket now and let's find out this is LG
G 6 vs 1 + 3 T this comparison is
actually more complicated than you think
on each hand we hold two devices that we
highly recommend and where this video is
really more a showcase of the reasons
why you should pick either one or the
other
visually I will admit I am a big fan of
both devices whether you prefer the
solid aluminum build of the 1 + 3 T or
the glass and metal approach of the LG G
6 both devices are elegant sturdy and
feel great in the hand about the only
advantage I'd give LG is the fact that
it has ip68 water in those resistance
where the 1 + 3 team doesn't defenses
are also found in dimensions even though
they're hard to notice the LG G 6 is
four millimeters shorter and four
millimeters narrower than the 3t even if
a hair thicker and 5 grams heavier but
obviously you have an insane camera hump
on the 3t where you don't have anything
on the g 6 LG manages to do this while
also offering a taller 5.7 inch panel
the company is dubbing its full vision
display offering little room for bezels
a new 2x1 aspect ratio or 18 by 9 and
quad HD + resolution its IPS technology
offers great color reproduction and
support for HDR 10 and Dolby vision the
3t may have a smaller 5.5 inch display
at 1080p resolution but it's really hard
not to love the fact that the company
chose AMOLED with punchy err color and
there are cases where you even notice
the 3t having a brighter display as well
and as for added value both companies
offer different approaches to always-on
displays but that I actually like both
and I recommend both regardless
internally it's where things get tricky
both devices support the same snapdragon
801 processor but then let's give
everything else to oneplus here see the
3t has two more gigs of ram it has dual
SIM support and even if it doesn't
include expandable storage the base
storage doubles that of the g6 on the
least expensive model both devices have
the same size battery and even if the g6
has a wireless charging and quick charge
3.0 it doesn't top-up nearly as fast as
the one plus 3t does through - charging
now I can't really say that those spec
differences will be noticeable in how
the phone handles graphics intensive
games or even day-to-day tasks as
neither of these devices struggles with
anything you throw at them another thing
I also love is that both companies are
flexible about what you can do with the
navigation buttons but oneplus offers up
to three different triggers per button
where in the case of the g6 you really
can only rearrange what the buttons do
and not all of these buttons are really
useful whereas on the one plus 3t you
can literally add anything you want and
that really takes us through the whole
software approach which is actually a
matter of taste I'm more of a fan of a
clean and stock Android approach of 1 +
versus LG's proprietary skin but it's
understandable for LG to offer a better
way to make use of this two by one
aspect ratio which is relatively new now
the problem of LG's approach is that it
doesn't really offer advantages into how
you can trigger buttons at the top of
such a tall display where even oneplus
lets you set navigation buttons to hit
menus whenever you need them even though
they're still not reachable so it's just
half-baked regardless where I will give
points to oneplus is the fact that it's
now running Android 7.1.1 nougat here
where LG continues to lag behind on the
g6 with Android 7.0 even if the company
promised 7.1 at launch now the reason
why 7.1 is so important is mainly
because of its battery optimizations
where I've been able to land a full day
with a 3t without a problem and where
the d6 really struggles to achieve
day of moderate use I won't declare a
winner and phone calls mainly because
both devices sound great and both also
disappoint and offering just a single
firing speaker at the bottom that's easy
to muffle now both devices past ones
real audio review with flying colors so
even if the speaker experience is not
the best you can trust either of these
with your headphone audio and then when
it comes to the cameras well this is
really not much of a debate anymore see
the t6 has a superior camera experience
regardless even if the one plus 3t has
done a ton of improvements the reason
why is because the g6 doesn't just sport
the added value of two separate cameras
with different fields of view but also
that the d6 performs better in low light
when compared to the 3t during the day
you can't really tell much of a
difference on either but there is just
too much of a difference inconvenience
when you add the wide-angle camera of
the g6 where none is really offering
with the one plus 3t and this
convenience is even offered with the
selfie shooter in the case of the g6
when compared to the 3t I have also
noticed improvements in the video
civilization with the 3t after the
recent new good updates but to really
side by side you can notice that the g6
will handle certain movement a little
better overall this is one of those very
difficult comparisons where as I
mentioned at the beginning it's really
pointless to declare a winner these are
two great phones that anyone would feel
proud of using and that I wouldn't mind
recommending to both my friends and
family obviously the 3t is significantly
less expensive than the g6 but in 2017
it's really hard to say that you're
getting more for your money given all
the design changes of the g6 and in
addition to that the g6 also offers a
better camera experience and ip68 water
and dust resistance still if these
things aren't crucial to you you could
save a couple of bucks and go for the 3t
what I will tell you is that regardless
of which device you pick I am sure you
will not regret it
