pocket now calm and today we're taking a
look at another LG application which is
available for free from the LG
application store inside Windows Phone 7
now it's called photo stylus now there
are quite a lot of applications for
windows phone 7 available in the
marketplace that allow you to tweak edit
apply certain effects to pictures you've
already taken or you have transferred to
your windows own but this one is free
it's made by LG and it has some cool
features so let's take a look oh and
here we are with LG's photo stylist we
have a nice splash screen while the
application is loading and right from
the start we are presented with two
options we can either take a new photo
or select the photo from those which are
already transferred to our windows phone
7 let's just capture a photo right now
we have this camera remote control here
and we'll try to capture a picture of
that
there we go it asks you if you want to
accept or retake the picture now but
this is good when you let's say you have
some camera shake or the picture quality
is not that good as you would have
expected will accept this picture and
the application automatically will load
up the picture now right from the
beginning we are presented with a user
interface which is divided into three
parts the first upper part is where all
the effects are listed now we have the
second part where we will have a preview
of the picture with the settings and
effects applied and at the bottom we
will have our this part here the screen
which will be responsible for all the
tweaks and for all the settings now this
certain filter will give your picture a
colored accent and as you swipe your
finger right here on this color bar and
release you will see that it will start
previewing we now gave our picture a
let's say reddish accent I don't know if
you can see that on the camera but it's
a little bit the difference is a little
bit let's say tiny we go forward to
beauty now this one will apply a
smoothing effect to your picture yeah it
changed I'll try to zoom in a little bit
so you can see how it changes if we get
to the minimum it's a little bit sharper
and if we go to the maximum setting it
will be a little bit smoother now next
one is called glow and it will make your
picture globe you can set smoothing you
can set also the brightness of the
effect let's take it to minimum and
smoothing also summer in the first part
and you will see it will smooth a little
bit lomo is applying vignetting and it's
amount let's see we want a
bigger moving yet and you can see there
it's automatically previewing and the
amount minimum or maximum you can see in
that preparing the preview that it
automatically changed mono is pretty
straightforward it will apply a
monochrome or let's say customized sepia
effect you can choose that say let's
choose a bluish tint and it will make a
monochrome bluish picture you can set
the contrast too high or too low
according to your preference rainbow is
a feature which makes one you can see
one picture here made out of four
smaller pictures of the same frame but
all of them are in different color I
don't know who would find this useful
but it's cool if you want to play around
with pictures vintage will make your
picture look vintage you can select the
amount of tint and this rules you will
see the difference is between maximum
and minimum vivid will do nothing else
but bump up the colors let's say if you
take it to minimum you are close to the
original but if you bump it up to
maximum all the colors will be more
vibrant and those of you who are using a
super amoled display will find this very
very useful so this was a short walk
through of the application called
picture stylist from LG for our next
part of the contest puzzle question take
your note the contest puzzle question
part of today is feature ? this wasn't

look at photo stylist application from
LG give it a thumbs up if you had like
