pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to take you through all the
software in the HP mini 1151 NR that's
on the verizon wireless network we're
going to run speed benchmarks talk about
battery life talk about the software
that comes on the netbook and things
like that so let's start off by turning
on the netbook and we do that if you saw
the hardware video a hardware tour
through this button down here and it's
kind of commerce emily placed because
it's a little difficult to slide it over
and let's see how long it takes to come
out of hibernate
okay so that was quite fast just a few
seconds to come out of hibernate okay so
here i am on the desktop and the first
thing that I did when I got the HP mini
out of the box is I disabled all of the
visual eye candy that comes in Windows
XP this being a netbook you want it to
be as light and fast as possible and
already with one gigabyte of RAM and the
1.6 gigahertz atom processor it's pretty
snappy especially since i'm not running
too many background processes but I went
into system and I went into the Advanced
tab and performance and I unchecked most
of these items that's why you get that
kind of old school windows 98 look when
they're you know there's no visual eye
candy turned on so for a browser I'm
using google chrome because Google
Chrome really gives you the maximum
amount of screen space when you're when
you're browsing the web because it takes
away the status bar on the bottom of the
screen and it also is quite lightweight
which is good for a netbook which it
doesn't have as much power as you know a
dual core quad core machine that you may
be using now right now I'm connected to
the Wi-Fi network in my office here and
I'm going to disconnect that and show
you what it's like to connect to the
verizon evdo network so I'm going to go
into the network configuration and I'm
going to disable the wireless area
network now I should note while I'm
doing this the purpose of the evdo
connection is not so that you will use
this all the time because you're limited
in the amount of data that you can use
and I'll talk about the pricing plans in
a minute it's so that when you don't
have Wi-Fi such as you're in the back of
a taxi cab or you're at the park or
you're just you know on in the back of a
car you're a passenger seat or something
like that you have internet access so
the way that we do this is you have to
launch this program first it's called
vzaccess manager just kind of
unfortunately always have to have this
program open in fact if you minima or
exit this program the connection won't
work so it starts off by saying please
wait while powering on the wireless
device and this is what you have to go
through every time you want to get
access via verizon's network and yeah it
takes a few minutes which is a little
bit annoying but again you're not going
to be using this feature as much as as
Wi-Fi
okay here we are and now i'm going to
click get access and i've got limited
signal here in the office so the speeds
aren't going to be that great but we're
going to do some benchmarks and i'll
talk about exactly how fast can possibly
go so i clicked get access and it's
going to take another few few moments
here to get the everything working ok
now it's showing me the kind of signal
that i have so i only have one bar and
in a moment i'll be able to click
connect and here we go connect and it'll
take another 34 seconds and we'll
finally be connected to the network
there it is it says connected to
broadband access revision a so we are
connected to verizon's network right now
we're not on Wi-Fi so let's see how fast
things are we can keep in mind that we
are using we're in an area where there
isn't great cell phone coverage so let's
go to youtube let's see how fast that
loads what you're going to notice is
things come on the screen very fast it
is a pretty fast connection let's go to
the the benchmark site speedtest net
which was fantastic for measuring your
broadband speed and let's see the kind
of speeds that we're getting right now
in the office over the verizon network
so click on that let me scroll down a
little bit so i can see the little meter
okay so it looks like we're going to max
out at about 1.3 mega bits per second
which is pretty good and we're going to
do the upload speed which is going to be
much much slower you don't want to
upload YouTube videos or anything like
that while on the verizon network and
we're getting a paltry point one five
megabits per second and I'm actually
surprised by how low that is how fast
can this go well this afternoon I tested
it in an area with great cellular
reception and I got actually 1.9
megabits per second down and about 0.5%
up which is quite good if i were to
tether my 3g phone to my laptop i
usually get about 1.1 1.2 megabits per
second at best so the fact that the
verizon network can get up to 1.9 that
is very encouraging and again you're
going to be using this connection for
casual web browsing you're not going to
be using it for downloading from itunes
or for uploading movies or anything like
that and so it's really quite adequate
and even even pretty extraordinary for
being able to get this wireless coverage
anywhere now what about the effect on
battery life well the battery life if
you're not using any any wireless is
about two and a half hours with this
3-cell battery you can get the six cell
battery option on the verizon netbook
although it costs an additional one
hundred and thirty dollars which
probably isn't worth it considering that
the netbook is two hundred dollars
itself now if you're using Wi-Fi expect
to get two hours of battery life if
you're using the evdo connection full
time expect about an hour and a half
it's definitely it definitely uses more
battery than does Wi-Fi because it
requires more power to get a cellular
signal than it does a short-range Wi-Fi
signal in terms of pricing you have to
pay for data of course on the verizon
network it's forty dollars for let's
actually go to the website it's forty
dollars for the 250 megabyte plan which
is really not enough especially if you
plan on doing some email attachment
downloading and that sort of thing but
for the five gigabyte plan it's only
twenty dollars more so if you're getting
this device you're likely going to want
to go with the the higher tier plan so
let's go to netbooks and things are very
snappy
and plans and accessories and here it is
the HP mini and here it is the unit cost
199 dollars it's subsidized and you get
these choices of plants there is no
unlimited plan it seems which makes
sense that would be a very big toll on
verizon's network if you could you know
download and upload an unlimited amount
of data so overall I'm quite excited
about the verizon HP mini netbook it's
their first attempt at a netbook and I
think they chose a really fantastic unit
with great performance and excellent
keyboard and a really nice look to it as
well although the outdoor visibility
isn't so great because the screen has
such a strong shine you can see the
reflection of the light right there the
evdo speeds are fantastic the only gripe
that I have is that it takes a little
bit of time to connect to their evdo
network and you can only use the
vzaccess manager to to connect that said
if you are a mobile professional then
certainly this device may be
indispensable to you so that's it for
the verizon wireless HP mini 1151 NR
we'll be back with some more coverage on
the netbook comparing it to the celio
red fly which is a windows mobile hub
that allows you to have a netbook like
experience but for your windows mobile
