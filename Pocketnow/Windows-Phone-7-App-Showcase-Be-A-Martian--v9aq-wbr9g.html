this is where we can get to analyze
Martian data and help out NASA in our
spare time
namely there's the video over here you
got tagged Mars and so it's going to
load an image from the rover and so I
can look at this and if I see anything
that I can recognize I can tag it as the
rover or the sky or land I'm not
entirely sure what this is so I don't
think I can tag it so I'll do pass now
it's got a little nother one so that's
pretty cool you can help analyze things
and another feature we can count craters
so it's going to download another Mars
image so now I can tap on the creator's
sound greater and help count them it

spare time as we got learn this is a
pretty cool connected thing we got quick

questions so you can go into a forum and
asked all sorts of questions about Mars
and other people will answer them that's
