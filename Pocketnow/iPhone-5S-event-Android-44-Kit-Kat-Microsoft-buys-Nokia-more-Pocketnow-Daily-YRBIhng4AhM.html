event official google has just landed a
gigantic android kitkat in their front
lawn and believe it or not microsoft
buys nokia I'm hina Rivera and can
somebody kindly ask these companies to
please announce their things one day
apart from each other this is pocket
nail daily oh man today has been one of
those days that's full of announcements
and that's actually positive i just wish
that they would just announce things one
day apart from each other but Apple is
first they had now some press
invitations for their September 10th
event and usually they say let's talk
iphone or let's talk i've had this time
they don't say anything but judging by
all the dots in the invitation it's
clear that we get all the colors that we
will find in the next iphone 5c and
probably our iphone 5s so stay tuned for
our live coverage happening on September
10 and speaking of surprises google has
landed this gigantic android kitkat in
their front lawn so yeah android 4.4
kitkat is the name of their next version
of android sadly we don't have any
details we don't know what it's gonna be
launched what phone is gonna be launched
with it but you know just wait for the
iphones launch and most probably in the
next couple of weeks we'll get that but
again leave us a comment down below
would you prefer keylime pie instead of
KitKat it seems like a whole nestle
sponsorship here now let's talk about
Sony and their Aoife than happening
tomorrow morning we've got the leak
press renders and press information on
the Xperia z1 which was the previous
honami and we also get more information
on the cyber-shot now they're being
dubbed cyber-shot those lens cameras
that are coming for smartphones
obviously the event happens tomorrow
morning our own Michael Fisher and Anton
v-notch will be covering everything
hands on everything you want and then
we'll be hosting a hangout happening at
1pm Eastern where we will be covering
the sansa event life but obviously we
will be talking about what we saw at
Sony so make sure you stay tuned for our
coverage and if you thought that the
Moto X was the only thing under Google
and Motorola sleep well we've got the
motorola dvx at the FCC right now and
it's actually in two units you remember
all those leaks of a European Moto X
that would be more affordable and have
replaceable back plates and well this is
the device we don't know if one device
is going to Europe and the other for the
United States is kind of hard to know
right now but it's kind of harsh that
you know the cheaper more for
bones get the replaceable back plates
and also the replaceable batteries and
you can't get that with a more expensive
model so let's see what goes and finally
for the incredibly hot news of the day
yes believe it or not Microsoft this
just made official that they're buying
no gift for around seven billion dollars
which is a lot less than they paid for
skype and yes Stephen Elop returns the
Microsoft as a Microsoft employee now
yeah nokia will remain being a company
they'll be in charge of their networking
solutions and everything that old
venture that they have with semen so
that still remains but their mobile
device division goes to Microsoft now
and it's just interesting I mean that
leads me to the question of the day do
you believe that this whole Microsoft
Nokia perches is actually part of a
bigger plan you know honestly it's just
interesting I mean the way things are
going it seems that they're actually
just looking to make Nokia more
affordable since the beginning so that
they could be able to buy it that's
pretty much what's happened so far with
this partnership and it's hard to know
if this will actually bring better units
better products to nokia and microsoft
let's just hope they do but leave us a
comment down below what are you
expecting and do you think that this is
actually a good or a bad thing and do
you think that it was part of a plan or
not I kind of think it was friends is
always for an earlier scope of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tough world my chief
always I'm out comment subscribe
