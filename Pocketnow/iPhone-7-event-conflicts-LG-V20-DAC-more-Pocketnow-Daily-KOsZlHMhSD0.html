the event date for the next iPhone LG n
the v20 will make audio files go crazy
according to some rumors and Google
takes an odd stance on the whole
quadrotor or whatever then name is
problem I'm hi Mary vera and yeah marvel
vs capcom continues to be one of my
favorite movies of all time this is
parking out daily
as we try to do so every day the
official nusa day begin with deals as if
you're in the market for the Samsung
gear s2 particularly that classic
variant I'm not really much of a fan of
the sport I love the classic a lot more
it's currently forty percent often it's
unlocked very into daily steals and yeah
there's pretty much a daily cielo I
highly suggest you consider and speaking
of round smartwatches one that we have
not seen yet but apparently isn't the
pipeline comes from the sous the company
has been famous for zen watches the
first one for being great the second one
for being affordable apparently the
third one will be all about a round
design crossing by the FCC it apparently
we should expect it soon can I wait to
see what we get a t5 if you're within
the 900 million Android smartphones
running Qualcomm procedures that are
being affected by the whole quadrotor
exploit and all that lovely thing that's
happening right now yeah I know we're
pretty much all stuck in that one
apparently google has just made an
official stance on it number one stating
the company is providing patched updates
and just about everything the problem is
that according to trusted sources the
update that we need to fix quadrotor is
probably more than a couple of weeks
away meaning you should beware what you
do with your phone over the next few
days we should learn more about quadra
in the link in the description I'll
spill the spotlight over to LG is the
company has pretty much made it official
that it's adopting quad deck technology
to the lgb 20 I love this about LG the
company doesn't keep any secrets quantec
technology brings 32-bit audio to the
b20 just to give you an idea the v10 had
a deck the g5 you needed to adapt one
with the v 20 you pretty much get the
same technology that you'd spend
hundreds of dollars for on regular
technology that audio files only would
know about this is crazy that means a
lot for the b20 we can not wait to give
it a try and finally the very
interesting rumors did they have to do
with the iphone 7 and bloomberg mainly
Apple in Bloomberg these two companies
number one because well Bloomberg has
conflicting rumors first it stated that
the probable September 7th event that's
being rumored er September 9
is going to be for macbooks that it has
nothing to do with iPhones apparently we
should expect the next max but pro great
I'm really in need of an update but
apparently then a couple of hours later
the company just retracted and said that
no the event is going to happen on sep
tember 739 and that it has everything to
do with the iphone as well so it just
makes everything crazy it could just be
that we're getting it it could just be
that we aren't but it leads me to the
question of the day are you ready for
the next generation iphone or are you
setting your eyesight's on any of the
current devices are already in the
market in my case oh my god the galaxy
note 7 will determine a lot I cannot
wait to get my review in it and then I
will report back on how i feel about
iphones leave us a comment down below
