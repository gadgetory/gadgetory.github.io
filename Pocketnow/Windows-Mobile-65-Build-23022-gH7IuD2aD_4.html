pocketnow.com and this is a look at a
new windows mobile 6.5 build that's 20
30 22 from XDA developers that bring
some mysterious new features that may be
paving the way for a build of windows
mobile that goes between 6.5 and seven
we've heard about a possible six point
five point one or possible 6.7 it's
tough to say but there are new features
in place that really allow for better
finger control that would be conducive
to abuse on a capacitive display for
example so let's go through those now to
start we have a larger notification area
at the top that's actually scrollable to
the right and to the left which will
help to manage multiple notifications if
you didn't have a stylist and I think
that's the key here so we can tap on the
volume icon and we get a very finger
friendly way to change the volume very
large obviously these things that we're
showing you aren't complete their kind
of the infrastructure that is being put
in place presumably for a new version of
windows mobile that has bigger buttons
and they can do some different things
also new and you've probably seen this
already is all the soft keys are down
here including the ok button it used to
be up here in the upper right and now
it's down here so if we go into an
application like notes it's really weird
to see four buttons on the bottom here
and now if you tap on the keyboard it
obviously brings up the keyboard it used
to be centered if you do a double tap on
the keyboard button you get the touch
input settings a lot of people that have
windows mobile devices compare that it's
really tough to get this keyboard
selector and the last feature that is
different or new in this build is the
magnifier so if we go into let's say
contacts and we want to make a new
contact okay and we type something and
then if we double tap watch what happens
we get a magnification box kind of like
an iPhone that'll allow us to position
the cursor presumably without a stylus
it's more difficult to position the
cursor especially on a capacitive
display but now with this double tap
feature you have that option obviously
this is very crude it doesn't work too
well but again we may be seeing the
pieces put in place for a
of windows mobile that comes between 6.5
and seven so we'll keep our ear to the
ground and when we hear more about this
possible interim build of windows mobile
you'll be the first to know follow us on
twitter at twitter.com slash pocket now
tweets that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
