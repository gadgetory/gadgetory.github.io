pocket cast this is our version of a
podcast we did one last week just as an
experiment to see if anybody really
wanted us to do more of them and
apparently the feedback hasn't been good
so here we are we're back again doing
another one the format will be like last
week so we're going to go through about
eight stories from the last week things
that were interesting that we posted
about on pocket now regarding smartphone
news and this week we have three people
joining us including myself we still
have Evan we still have Evan blast
managing editor if he got a new
microphone and we've made a lot of
improvements to the setup so you should
be able to hear him better say hi Evan
hey guys favourited hey and we've also
got Tony senior editor also known as
Anton on the site he's coming from
Romania so he's got a fantastic accent
that I wish I had say hi Tony hey guys
nice to be here thank you so so yeah and
this podcast should were calling the
pocket cast work we're eliminating that
word podcast from vocabulary should be
distributed not only on youtube like
last time but also iTunes and zune if
all goes according to plan it's a little
bit more complicated than I thought it
was going to be but we should be able to
get it out there or at least as a direct
download so you can put it right on your
device listen to it on the way to work I
don't know why you want to do that but
so let's get started we're going to
start with what do we what are we
starting with thinking this blogger the
inspire yes just a couple of notes on
the inspire 4G of course this is a tease
first 4g phone but it's not really for
jamming it's been certified as a 4g
standard but it's it's probably 3.75 g
if you were to define it as anything and
we're actually getting some problems
with it we're talking to AT&amp;amp;T right now
but right now what's happening and
hopefully by the time this podcast
pocket casts goes up we'll have an
answer i'm getting an h+ indicator all
the time and yet i'm not getting hspa+
which is very deceiving and you know
AT&amp;amp;T has advertised that there
VA plus network is reaching millions and
millions of people as if they flip the
switch and everyone lights up that's not
true they did flip a switch but it will
only turn on hspa+ in areas that have
the quote enhanced backhaul which means
that they've upgraded the equipment on
cell phone towers and whatnot but AT&amp;amp;T
isn't making it known which areas are
getting the enhanced back also maybe
some small corner of New York has hspa+
while the rest of the country is dark or
maybe come februari 13th when the
inspire 4G hits it will be turned on
we're branded let me let me interrupt
you for a sec I think the problem here
is that that you're you're getting an
indicator showing that you're getting
hspa+ say that you're um you know that
you're connected to the network but
you're not actually getting the speeds
yep that's it that's it's just
misleading you know
okay that was an interesting sound in
Romania do they have hspa+ or is it
pretty much all hsdpa its moral hsdpa so
we get suburb once you advertise but
it's nothing close to that what do you
get in real world testing best case well
let's say someone points 8 + 3.5 if you
have full coverage yeah that's pretty
much where we get around here Evan have
you at benchmarked your iphone 4 yeah
nothing special nothing special Tony
tell everyone how fast Orlando in
connected oh well let me just say this
without advertising my eyes be in
Romania it's the fastest internet and
the cheapest one in the whole Europe I
mean we may like the nine dollars per
month and I had 100 megabytes per second
for downloads and some are close to 10
for uploads fantastic that's any uploads
are faster than my down that's
unbelievable and what do you what do you
actually clock when you go to like
speedtest.net all its around 80 for a
690 it depends on the distance to the
server so so Tony's in Romania getting
84 megabits per second down for nine
dollars and in the u.s. I think there's
a still a tremendous amount of people
that don't even have regular broadband
yet it's really interesting how how did
that come to be this is totally off
topic but well they're our topic and
this is another discussion related to a
salaries and wages while you are
bringing some thirty dollars for
internet and it will be lets say around
a 15 spark of your salary in Romania
people pay for internet somewhere around
the tents or the 8th part of their
monthly wages so it's so expensive if
you live and earn your money here Ghani
the issue is also i'm like geographic
and that it's a lot easier to roll out
the infrastructure and in a small area
in europe then than it is over the
entirety of the united states so yeah I
mean I bet Romania doesn't have
vast stretches of farmlands like we do
here nobody's internet access is mainly
in the cities so don't think that the
whole Romania is covered by I speed
internet no major cities are yes but
villages and other lands are not so I
think there are people in Romania many
many many that don't even know what
computer is so don't get me wrong very
interesting already well so let's move
on from the inspire 4G again look for
the post on pocket now in a video
showing this in action and we're waiting
to hear back hopefully within the next
hour and a half from AT&amp;amp;T on this just
to make it fair because there's got to
be something going on here so let's move
on something we posted on actually today
and actually several times through the
week about the HTC saga we first showed
you a picture of what we thought would
be HTC's flagship the desire to
basically a phone that looks like and
what does this look like this is like
the desire maybe yeah like a rounder
version of the desire with a bit
imagination a little bit imagine a
little bit nexus one it overall kind of
a bland design I mean if this if this is
really HTC's next flagship proof they're
going very conservative on this one
indeed so so we're seeing we're seeing
some pictures of it and now today we saw
a picture of it with three microphone
holes which no one else seems to be
noticing and I guess the thought is that
two of them are for noise cancellation
and the third is for kind of honing in
on the audio when you're filming a video
is it I'm not a sir I'm sorry coming
continue I'm sorry so I was just asking
click record maybe stereo so oh that's
that's a possibility or if not stereo
sound maybe it's the first android HTC
phone to do 1080p video recording and
they wanted to add a better quality of
of audio so I was just going to say that
you know it
it's far from certain that this is going
to be this is going to be a flagship
device I mean you know I think we can
assume that it's probably the follow-up
to the desire HD but I think it's also
possible that that HTC has some other
handsets in the works that that you know
we just haven't seen yet including this
this one called a pyramid that you know
we really have a bother to talk about
because it hasn't been much said about
it other than you know it'll be might be
one of HTC's first devices to step up
beyond the 1 gigahertz or or 800
megahertz some Snapdragon processors
that that basically you know been in all
of their hands heads for last few years
yeah and what is to say that the saga
also doesn't have a dual core processor
with a 965 540 screen plus some other
quote stuff that maybe sense three-point
oh so it looks a little bit uh
unassuming but perhaps once we see the
spec sheet it's more than just a you
know conservative designed phone one
more thing guys I smell something fishy
here regarding this data I mean I
inclined to believe that HTC is doing
say a control bleep member do you
remember how they did it would be
incredible HD in the Thunderbolt I me
now yeah they have those prototypes and
most of the pictures that were surfaced
on the internet and elite they came from
Taiwan I mean HTC you must for sure know
which one of their employees got to
throw the dice chair isn't it something
is she here so yeah because I'll tell
you something else that the vivo which
is which is going to be the incredible a
lot to that that's all over picasa right
now so you know that's taken quite a few
pictures the saga hasn't taken anything
so i think HTC is well aware of what's
going on about information that's
leaking in and some of it is indeed done
strategically what we want to remember
all these leaks started after our
exclusive of the render we found the
posted it's a good point good point well
but what would their reason being doing
this well the same reason the units for
the Thunderbolts
by the way its variants anticipation
building but from now we're talking
about it you're advertising it we are or
another theory could be that this device
the saga is a prototype maybe last
generation because it actually looks
very last generation and maybe they're
going to come out with something that
blows this out of the water and so
they're setting expectations kind of
kind of kind of low you know what I mean
well let me tell you this one doesn't
come up with a dual core processor and
gingerbread HTC is losing the game Evans
gonna have to write another dear HTC bra
that was a good one um cool well let's
let's move on from here we are going to
februari first talking about the HTC
mozart being Wi-Fi certified and perhaps
heading to the heading to t-mobile in
the US you know it's it's been kind of
quiet with Windows Phone 7 hardware
releases in this I mean this isn't
really news this isn't that I mean we've
seen the Mozart before yeah should I
start or Evan sure good I'm sorry ok so
look I don't think there's really much
more to the story here I mean
manufacturers have laid down their cards
on the table at the time where you know
windows phone 7 was launched the devices
are the same will accept the dell venue
pro which is still in and out of markets
and the HTC 7 pro so i don't think there
will be any change in devices until the
second wave of devices come out and
until then manufacturers are trying to
somehow move devices from one region to
the other they are moving the sprint
exclusive 7 pro to europe and they are
moving this with the mozart to us so i
think that's the only option until the
sector where it comes out to their
detriment clear on my dad yes yes yes
and i think the HTC trophy like
launching on verizon and whatever it's
going to be you know march april which
which is going to be you know possibly
as much as six months after it launched
in Europe and when in the first place
you know it
was really sort of a you know I'm not
all that impressive device you know sort
of at least in terms of the windows from
seven devices launch devices it was
pretty on unremarkable so I certainly
think that six months later when it's
going up against you know that atrix is
and it infuses it just doesn't look very
good it's they need to keep the momentum
up but I mean this is very this is very
typical of Microsoft you know they do a
little they do something pretty great
but too late and by that time the
competitive landscape has changed
significantly I mean they needed to keep
the momentum with Windows Phone 7 by
bringing forth a wave of new phones as
soon as six months later and in the
corporate world that may seem crazy but
I mean you got to be agile and you got
to compete a little bit faster than a
Mozart or or trophy six months after we
already knew about it it's ridiculous
nobody handsome now I will say the
Mozart is handsome I like it I think it
sounds a nicer launch pond's I mean
first of all it's got an 8 megapixel
camera it's got a pretty nice body style
compared to some of the other ones and
material if they use and and the shape
of it you know it's it's fairly slim you
know it's pretty compact for for this
first wave devices so I like it so I was
just saying that by the way momentum and
second wave of devices what do you think
of this these rumors that started these
days with the microsoft and nokia
preparing to announce something do you
think that the nokia will finally adopt
windows phone 7 and if yes will be a
second wave device or maybe a first
worth of us there's so many issues at
play there there is smoke the the
primary issue of how I think Microsoft
has NV nokia for many many years I
remember going to the microsoft campus
in 2005 for for some mobile get together
and the head the head guys we're talking
about nokia like they were they were
gods i mean nokia number one number one
billions of dollars we got to get there
you know they they have a great strategy
so it would come to knows it would be no
surprise that they would work together
but then how would it fit in wood nokia
sort of be the premium hardware partner
of Microsoft no because Microsoft wants
to make sure HTC and Samsung and LG have
a lot of have a lot of notoriety to get
their devices out I mean what could they
possibly do together well I think it
behooves I mean if he who is Microsoft a
lot to get there's many manufacturers as
they can on the on the windows phone 7
bo I mean it you know it's the same
strategy with desktop PCs is you know
gopher gopher quantity and try to get as
many as many OEMs on board as you can
because you know obviously there's more
you know throw as many darts at the dart
board as you can some of her gonna stick
well they'd have to do something special
with Nokia because no key is in a
position where they could go with
Android and make great you know put some
great software on there and on great
hardware and so if they're gonna go if
they're gonna date Microsoft exclusively
Microsoft's got to be giving some better
deal oh absolutely not theirs I can
almost guarantee you that it would not
be an exclusive relationship I'm almost
one hundred percent guarantee that that
Nokia would not give up me go and
Symbian to go for a windows phone 7 only
strategy I mean it's it's almost
impossible to see that happen if
anything I think this would just be
added to their their stable of platforms
I think Nokia probably looks at at HTC
and and how they've been successful but
you know two person with their dual
platform strategy of Android and Windows
Mobile first and then Windows Phone
nouns you know it's been working out
well for them HTC just had you know
another record quarter and I think Nokia
sees that and says you know what do we
have to lose by by picking up yet
another OS the worst that's going to
happen is it's you know it's going to be
unsuccessful but we're sort of you know
in a little bit of dire straits now
anyway so why not take a risk well I
think it's a win-win situation I mean
Microsoft wins because they have the new
manufacturer nokia rings because they
are selling devices and users will be
because nokia is building fantastic
phones just look at HTC look at LG
windows phone 7 s they all have crappy
cameras look at how you look at your
nokia n8 review its upcoming it's
fantastic
the build quality is good and when
windows phone 7 on it I think it will be
huge what in a big good wouldn't it be
cool if i agree i mean nokia has has
really good hardware and as you apply
Tony in Adams upcoming review he thinks
he finds the camera on the ne ne to be
so sometimes rival his DSLR what yeah
it's it's incredible what would be
awesome and we kind of talked about this
a lot Evan nine tony about how hardware
so important you'll be awesome if nokia
created these like awesome devices you
go to their website and you could like
fill in a little radio check box I want
windows phone 7 on this i want android
2.3 on this and it comes to looks leo
semi customized in that respect well
everyone if you get the chance to see
this in the future you should know the
idea came from us haha right and I mean
furthermore I think it would be awesome
for any on that note to any OEM to come
out with sort of a customization
platform for smartphones you choose your
CPU you choose your RAM this would be
probably what was that site that we saw
to go grab it yeah I know what you mean
there's a like a prototype just like it
but I mean that would be too expensive
for the consumer unfortunately it would
be probably potentially too expensive
for the OEM so that's why they don't do
it because all the drivers and you have
to actually two or three or more
operating systems on the same hardware
so it will be a bit difficult yeah yeah
and I mean those you never get software
upgrades because they have to configure
for potentially dozens of different
types of devices both hi so so I guess
the takeaway here is hopefully we see
some some interesting nokia windows
phone 7 hardware or at least there's a
forthcoming wave of Windows Phone 7
devices I think keepsake at the very
least would say something big is
happening with Nokia whether it's a move
to other platforms or you know a bigger
us push some you know they they said
that something big is gonna happen
you're a major strategy changing and so
I maybe definitely have something to
look forward to yeah yeah all right
let's move
let's see we are talking about med on
january thirty first we were talking
about the pre to on verizon we've been
talking about the pre to on verizon for
many many months i think it was
announced back in october and you know
as HP palm have their event coming up in
what a week and then the pre to is gonna
launch kind of late don't you think yeah
it's kind of funny we've seen the pre to
the verizon pre to show up just about
everywhere about verizon it's been on
every other like retailer site it's been
an ads you can now buy unlocked gsm
rhythm which I actually have right here
there you go so yeah I don't know about
the timing of this i think it's sort of
suspect them and if anything this is
going to end up being you know a mid to
low low range of webos device if there
is anything else released i think or
announced it would be that the verizon
is pulling all old ball models and they
will be lets say announcing a tablet to
replace them hmm well they look I they
still Nina we still need to have a phone
we're pretty sure that they're going to
launch the pre too so I mean that's
going to happen so the question is where
where is the pre to then going to sick
and in a lineup of new webos smart
phones you know presumably pond has to
go higher end now to to attract some
attention but you know they may also try
to slap something you know pixie like
underneath the tree to and try to
capture some of that entry-level
smartphone market don't this verizon
pulls this off then they will have the
iphone for the Thunderbolt for Android
and the bomb-bay tuned to webos so I
think that will cover pretty much the
meteors except when those 17 yes have
you used webos Tony no no unfortunately
on is it available in Romania no maybe
if I import or buy from another country
but as far as I know
years or other shops or e taylor center
selling phone devices yeah i haven't
seen it on anything romanian websites
either and i do like each other actually
really mm-hmm have you have you used
webos Evan yeah I wouldn't say I'm you
know expert in it but I definitely have
some sub working familiarity with it I
think it's it's interesting so many
people agree and say this all the time
that webos is awesome i mean the concept
of the cards and the way that it works
is awesome it's just it's already stale
and dead in the hardware is horrible
it's not horrible but the screen
resolution is low the battery life still
not great the keyboards junkie so you
know presumably the tide will turn come
next week and they definitely need high
end devices and with on-screen keyboards
and high-resolution screens and you know
can I go a little bit off topic here
while talking about webos i'm not
totally off topic there's an online
survey coming and going for like three
or four days now it's the OS bowls
finals yes i like yeah HP webos is in
the finals with guess who windows phone
7 happened i'm looking at the current
results and HP webos has 49.7 to 2% of
oats and windows 7 as 5528 i think that
the system got game yes somebody
somewhere lovely most probably published
something saying people go vote for
windows phone 7 i mean i'm a windows
phone 7 a fan but it can be windows from
seven beat apple iOS for the finals so
it's strange i think i found that reason
it's posted on XDA developers and
there's like a thousand replies so
that's right so that's kind of a that's
kind of a difficult thing to determine
because naturally people are going to
vote for the operating system that they
use are using yep or they're going to
try to game the system and make a winner
out of something
shouldn't be a winner or wouldn't be a
winner but uh further wearing Dada for
the win hey mesons and that's such a bad
little platform there oh yeah even
reviewed a bottle phone yet mmm we
didn't because it's not technically a
smartphone uh I mean I they are they are
for well they're not in the in the in
the context that we define the word in
their old last one but f decays and
developers there they're very much it's
very much I'm entry-level smartphone
platform isn't it the same like blue M V
like the dumb smartphones or smart dumb
phones no I I think that it's you know
it's more akin to to webos and it's got
you know they've got an SDK to people
developing for bada so yeah it's it's
it's own legitimate platform um you know
certainly they're not they're not
monetizing it the way that the android
or iOS is but yeah it's um and i think
that there are you know that they're
iterating their only on a father should
chug 1.5 now oh yeah there it's becoming
something and I'm a little bit surprised
because it's pushing the needle a little
bit it's starting to show up you know on
when they do on evaluations and surveys
of who's of what platforms have
percentages and it's starting to to
actually make it into those surveys he's
had a you know one for one or two
percent of the market it would help if
they launched in the US one of the
problems is that why would someone
choose bada when they could choose you
know like Android which looks a lot like
pada most cases what I don't know Owens
I think are the hardware they're pushing
it is as less expensive we know with the
androids are still some licensing fees
associated with it even though you're
not paying Google you have to pay all
these companies that have patents that
now Android may or may not infringe upon
but would buy you know that some that
Samsung's home-brewed OS so you know
they're they're paying very little to to
roll it out on a lot of devices and I
can bring the price of a hardware down
usually you see that the bottom of us
that's more budget oriented than a low
end android device like the HTC Wildfire
i think if they start out like that but
if there's some body phones now that
that aren't cheap i mean like the way of
to I don't think that's I don't think
that's entry-level by any means so I
don't know it'll be interesting to see
where body goes because it is making
more of a splash than I thought and and
you know Samsung is smartly diversifying
beyond windows phone seven and an
Android which HTC sort of is trying to
do with the the brew MP I mean if it's
not going to happen but if Android fails
and Windows Phone 7 fails at the same
time again not going to happen you know
if if people sunday is combusted if the
world ends well then HTC is left with
what well brew MP products I was yeah
right we'll have to be impossible just a
note of clarification I think you
mentioned Evan that when an oem puts
android on the phone they don't have to
pay Google a licensing fee they do have
to pay a licensing fee if they include
any of the above android market you know
gmail the Google Maps any Google
application and they get up they gonna I
think they get a fair amount of revenue
from that because most OEM is included
yeah every device isn't really I would
think that that Google would be paying
them to take it like they do on with the
search agreements because if you who's
google to get their products on as many
devices as possible while while OMS have
a choice of going with Google stuff or
or possibly thing or you know their own
their own home brewed applications well
I I think I think that I sort of look at
it the other way in OEM would want to
have the google search and would want to
have google products there's an
exception to this our coast which has a
line of 2.8 4.3 5.18 all these different
they call them tablets they run android
a lot of them especially the low-end
really cheap ones that are like 150
bucks don't come with the android market
they come with the archos market which
links out to like
and apps and they're doing that to keep
the cost down at the detriment to the
experience of the user interesting yeah
don't buy the rocket ass is so
informative no boy it should start
listening in we shouldn't try it I'm
gonna start listening to the pocket
casts and we have we have free
subscribers already haha very fun
alright well let's move on from the pre
to hopefully there's going to be some
really cool stuff coming out of webos
soon because the boss is good what was
good alright so let's talk about the
yahoo mail issue turns out that the
mysterious source of Windows Phone 7
data usage came from yahoo mail but I
guess even though it was birthstone
suspected to be HTC right I love ya the
hub how I mean it seems that Windows
Phone 7 is quite locked down to avoid
any application taking control of really
anything and doing anything negative
edge I gotta wonder how this could have
do you guys know the technicalities
behind this not actually but there's
there's a post from Rafael Rivera who is
explaining it very well and he's been
the one with how it go well that pointed
the initial finger towards yahoo mail
and he's the one that points in the face
pointing the finger towards yahoo having
the same problem on iOS because if you
remember yahoo to its own defense said
that there is no problem with the ugly
real application on other platforms this
was after apologizing but they started
pointing fingers at microsoft and this
rafael rivera guy has made some tests
and guess what iOS has the problem to
the same problem only the differences
that is less noticeable the iOS version
of yahoo mail goals for 50 messages if i
recall well from the server role in this
47 fetches around 200 that's the biggest
difference so that's that's the
conference is that right yeah and I
think the answer your question Brandon
is that
there's certain um developers big
developers like you know netflix or
yahoo who have more access to be on the
core api's and the code the native code
and then say you know your your average
developer house right right cool cool
well I don't know if there's much more
to discuss about this do you guys have
any other although I just say it's it's
not fair from yahoo to point the finger
back at Microsoft and I'm not defending
Microsoft I say drops the mattress off
for actually admitting the problem and
bucks yeah 3 4 for apologizing for the
problem but the they should have stopped
here is that they have started pointing
finger pointing fingers again and i
think this got a little bit ugly
everyone needs to just hug it out yeah
okay haha all right let's move on this
is a story I wanted to cover because um
well I guess you'll find out why kin
studio closes permanently we're kin
which also technically doesn't fit under
the smartphone umbrella of course was
launched in May of 2010 and it was
cancelled in what like July so three
months later this project that Microsoft
spent millions of dollars on they had a
big press conference about they they
killed it and now the pork in users the
five of them up oh wow but alright they
they they can't use their phone as it
was intended i think they should all get
rebates or something or you know well i
think that was a story back in december
when the first rumors got out that
verizon is actually killing that in
studio that they will give out free 3g
phones for King users and as a
reparation yeah I don't know do you know
anything about this then does those who
all the way I remember hearing I care
about not honestly that there was there
there really were probably so if you can
solve any you know it just really didn't
that if there was an exchange program or
just really did make a news because
there wasn't a lot of people taking
advantage of it
I was uh I was watching the engadget
show on the way to I don't know las
vegas for CES and i watched an old
episode where they were talking about
ken before Kim came out and I forget who
one of the guys was saying you know hey
you know I think Kim could work you know
it's hitting a market that doesn't that
doesn't have a particular phone targeted
at them and then the other side said
this is the biggest piece of garbage to
ever of graced our computer monitors and
then we wrote of course why you know the
five reasons why kid died hasn't it's
just been sort of it fun to watch
because that is just well I think ken is
a product that it could have worked no
two or three years ago but I think at
this point Microsoft's or so under
estimated that the sophistication of the
market that they were looking at and and
they thought that that you know teens
and tweens want to dent want to dumb
down smartphones when in fact they just
want regular smartphones and you know if
you go into any school kids are using
iPhones and you know android and and
really you know blackberries even just
regular smartphones they don't want
something that's you know stupid what
should I say smile what's the right word
then stupid is not the right word haha
there's sort of the functionality has
been reduced that they've been dumbed
down a little bit yeah yeah and about
those of five users you remember that
there was this rumor that there were
five hundred or so Kim's so yeah Adam
Adam wrote a post on 7th of July 2010
and he was saying that according to a
certainty an application on Facebook
there were at that time around almost
9,000 users of the key an application of
facebook which implies approximately the
same amount of kids being sold and I'm
looking at the page right now and we
have somewhere close to 2000
so uh it was decreasing oh that's
interesting so maybe if you don't login
or I guess what's happening is I don't
know why would that go down people i
bought a device I don't like it and I
work in summer those uses them waco you
return it yeah yeah on that note evan
with this sort of trying to be a
low-cost accessible smartphone for young
people the data plan was as much as a
standard smartphone which just didn't
make sense yeah that was a fail fail
they should have had like a tween data
plan you know no no data during school
hours you know it's funny guys thinking
about when we were in school we didn't
have maybe maybe we had smartphones I
didn't have a smartphone until I
graduated last year brer yeah yeah I
just I'm not that young uh it's just
funny to think about like if we had
iphones in class if we had joy texts in
class we could I guess would it be make
school better or worse we could text our
friends before we get the lunch I'm sure
that there's many rules prohibiting that
but it's just fun to think about yeah it
would make it worse I mean it's phones
are already distracting for adults at
jobs you know imagine like kids who are
trying to learn in school where they're
already kind of bored yeah it's a
distraction one time my brother who
actually started pocketnow had handed me
down an ipaq one of the big I packs with
the expansion sleeve and one of the
add-ons of the expansion sleeve was an
ethernet adapter and i remember at my in
my high school they had you know
plug-ins for the computer stations and
one day after school I was so excited I
was like well I can get internet on this
little screen i plug in the ethernet
cable to my my ipaq expansion sleeve i
plug it the other side into the little
station and i'm like surfing the web on
this qvga transflective display it was
it was heaven
yeah I remember getting that feeling
using like a palm constancy for the
first time that I think was the first
palm Wi-Fi yeah it was one of those tiny
little screens but just two TVs like
great like color web pages showing up
yeah pretty much how they were supposed
to look on I'm a desktop it was just
amazing what do you guys think would
make let's say if Kim studio made it to
Windows Phone 7 would its boost windows
phone 7 I love the idea of remote phone
management you know the HTC Desire HD
and they inspire all those new devices
can let you access HTC Sense calm and
depending depending on what day of the
week it is you'll get different
functionality but I love the idea of
being able to send text messages through
the web browser having all your photos
sync to the cloud I think I think
windows phone 7 would hugely benefit
from a kin studio like product I mean
think about it android has web cloud
products in sort of different pieces iOS
doesn't have anything like it and it
could be a real real thing to to
differentiate so what do you guys think
can we expect in studio to come the
windows phone 7 I vote I hope you
haven't they said that they're going to
try to bring something like that I mean
I know he's not even called kin studio
but help so I can imagine that there
will be some go before you know what was
the what's the name of the other the
Microsoft service windows like now the
one the one I was on windows mobile 6.5
cloud oh oh my phone my phone phone
phone yeah I can see that that's sort of
been expanding and becoming a little bit
more user-friendly he'll think I don't
think my phone is necessarily as
optimized as it could have been for for
the average user hmm yeah it is a little
bit technical I mean yeah there's
there's no doubt that this would be a
winning thing to do it's already been
proved in a little bit with the previous
cloud products but the again it's about
timing are they going to wait until 2012
to bring this out or are they going to
do it soon when they the strike while
the iron's hot hopefully oh it's
comes to windows phone 7i think it will
come summer in the second half when when
we can expect the second major update
for windows phone 7 so this is my guess
yeah and by then you know microsoft's
working on the next update of Windows
Phone 7 so probably done and then
they're working on this bigger update by
then we'll know about iOS four point or
what are we up to now 5 you know and and
it's gonna it's going to have stuff like
that we can't even imagine and you know
microsoft's going to come through this
awesome update that would have been cool
today but it's just 10 months to wait
boom I'm being really down on Microsoft
but sometimes it just it just frustrates
me the whole the whole timing it's just
really puts them in a disadvantage
sometimes anyhow um alright soak in
studio closes that's probably the last
thing we'll ever say about Kim alrighty
he can yeah alright pkn but that starts
the look oh I hope so yeah there's a
everyone should check this out I think
it was our IP KN right mmm we're all
checking we should edit out this part
now we'll leave it I don't know it's not
here anyway next thing I want to talk
about here is something that I really
don't want to talk about because things
aren't working out the way that I
thought they would or hope they would ha
I know we're gonna get into sad yeah
yeah so you know this is about honeycomb
and you know we have the the Google
event I think was on Tuesday which would
be februari first Oh is Wednesday second
and we were hoping very much that we
would see something about the next
version of android on smartphones
thinking that there would be a version
of honeycomb for phones and it would
kind of make sense we've had a ton of
posts about how this could work but they
didn't talk anything about honeycomb on
phones which sort of makes sense they
just released gingerbread android
release cycles for phones is like six to
eight months so you know we'll see
something this summer but it would have
been nice to hear at least one utterance
of an indication of
what the next version version of Android
will sort of focus on four phones well
I'd say it doesn't surprise me that much
because first of all the gingerbread
which is fresh and second of all I think
we should have seen this one coming
because I think I remember summer on the
way we saw some rumors some here say
about honeycomb being actually a tablet
only platform and it's normal with the
with the market being dominated by apple
and ipad of course there's galaxy tab
and there's the upcoming tempts you but
they both run android 2.2 froyo so come
on they should come up with something to
to bring that competition to a point
where maybe Apple will actually start
losing points of the market and bringing
it didn't you watch that interview with
was it Matias Duarte I don't yeah I've
got it right on my screen now and and i
wrote a post right after i saw that you
know josh Topolsky from engadget
interviewed him at CES and I could have
sworn I listened closely I could have
sworn he said something to the effect of
you're going to see Android or you're
going to see honeycomb come to phones
now what he probably meant is you're
going to see parts of honeycomb come to
a future version of Android and write
that I think that that kind of threw us
off a little bit or threw me off but I
mean there's there's a lot of I guess
there's a little bit less potential and
sort of bringing the honeycomb
experience with the new what are they
caught holographic interface the new
home screen manager the button list
design the stacks are kind of cool I
think those could translate to
smartphones especially the ones you know
with now that we're moving up to two qHD
resolution yeah yeah no problem I was
just going to say you know it would be
awesome if in a future version of
Android you could have a tablet mode
that you could turn on or a phone mode
so people with good eyesight and large
screen phones could use sort of the
split pain view in certain applications
that would be awesome what does that
imply maybe a hypothetical minimum
requirement the five inches
plays at least I mean it will be
difficult on on 3.7 3.8 some or even
four point freeze yeah yeah it would
which is why I would be nice to be able
to turn it off you know on a 4.3 inch
display looking at a dull pain emailview
probably would be reasonable yeah it
seriously depends on how good your
eyesight is and also of course how small
they can get the pixels on a on an
android phone so we are going to keep
our ear close to the ground about the
next version of android naturally since
we don't cover tablets we're trying to
give it a smartphone spin so as Android
Honeycomb comes around two tablets will
be diving in a little bit to see what we
can learn about you know what Google has
in store for the next version of android
cuz it's always fun to look ahead boom
it is we love looking ahead at one of
our main things here that is right all
right bro hard always ahead full speed
alright so next thing and we've got just
a couple more things to talk about this
pocket cast is probably gonna be a
little bit shorter than than the
previous one for better or for worse so
the next thing we're talking about is
the motorola atrix 4g kind of kind of a
surprise but not really if you're if you
think about it for a sec the atrix 4g
with the doc whether you get the laptop
or the or maybe it's just with the
laptop if you get the doc you have to
pay the tethering fee which is another
20 bucks a month and people were kind of
outraged about this because you know
you're not necessary but not really what
you guys think about this well i think
you know um I think in one in one sense
it's reasonable because you you are
using it you are using the internet with
a device that that's going to naturally
be be pulling down you know more data
than than you would or could with the
smartphone itself you know especially
because they have that full firefox
browser on there
presumably there's going to be a lot
more video watching and you know flash
browsing whatever so in one sense i can
see yet you know it's basically like you
know tethering your your regular phone
to a netbook and why shouldn't you have
to pay that extra feet but but another
hand you know they're they're selling
this as one of the on the integral
features of the handset you know one of
the main reasons why you should buy it
so it leaves a little bit of a sour
taste in your mouth that you should have
to pay an extra you know x dollars per
month to be able to take advantage of
what sort of being sold or or implied a
little bit as a core functionality yeah
do you guys remember I think we weave
unit approximately two years ago the CEO
red flight a new you're going to say
that I knew you're gonna say that yeah
I'm actually that one was a dummy device
it wasn't operating on its own my
question is the eight races duck is it
operating on itself or is it tied to the
agents and they are forming one I don't
think it has its own its own OS or
anything I think all that it brings to
the equation is the ability to to to
have a full firefox browser as opposed
to you know your your your standard
Android browser 20 point you're just
using the handset so then was the
justification of a daring feat is the
atrix and about our one because it's the
usage on the usage scenario is i think
so if i have a keyboard or a larger
screen i tend to consume more intimate
than i would be on my age makes alone
right I think that the theory there and
I think I'm actually the atrix doc that
speaking that on the laptop there's
nothing inside of it but a screen
keyboard in the mouse I'm pretty darn
sure that everything's happening on the
phone you know thanks to the dual core
and the one gigabyte of RAM absolutely
um it does sound like they they might be
charging quite a bit of money though for
this is dumb terminal well I think that
the the laptop was there a price i think
was 150 night
now I'm hearing closer to the 400 or 450
really which I guess the multimedia dock
was 150 the thing you can connect here
boom what I think they should do is and
I mean you're gonna this is you're going
to make people unhappy either way you
could either charge them extra data and
add to their monthly bill and people
hate monthly bills because when you get
a smartphone it's already much higher
much higher than you were paying with a
feature phone they could do that or they
could increase the price of the the
little laptop you know by a significant
amount and sort of have all of the extra
data fees paid for for you know two
years or whatever well I think money
will turn their backs on the HH stock
and mata for that matter for the veteran
feed but i think the real loser here
besides the user is motorola itself
because this is their sort of first
attempt at something like this and
people aren't going to like it is it i
mean would you buy a dog if you had to
be a tethering fee for for that dog to
use with your phone yeah i would use the
money to buy a freakin net no not
netbook a tablet or a macbook air or
something else that's then in light and
can compute yeah i think people buy it
in the same way that people bought that
that projector that that you know um
tacked on to the LG expo even though it
wasn't a very good projector and for a
couple bucks more you could have you
know by your own dedicated projector
that that hooked into the video out and
gave you a better picture by your
picture or whatever but but the fact
that it's integrated with the phone
people you know they really they're into
their phones they want to get the
accessories for it and and for people
where where money is in as much of an
issue i think they're definitely going
to pick this thing up mmm i mean we
could probably go back and forth all day
about this product and and we would
probably both be equally right but i
think that this idea is flawed just like
the palm folio was fall just like the
celio red fly was flawed I mean you
could are you could argue that the
technology has improved
lastly for this this laptop thing but I
don't I I'm thinking about use case
scenarios and I can't think of it I mean
if I'm gonna grab something substantial
and the laptop dock is very thin but it
is substantial I'm going to get
something that can do more than browse
Firefox and let me remotely access my
phone I'm gonna bring my tablet I'm
going to bring my you know my laptop or
something I what I think they're really
looking at this as a netbook replacement
end and in that sense it I mean it is if
you know when the atrix has basically
the specs in the phone you know a
dual-core processor 1 gigahertz are
hiring anybody by to ram and that's what
they are he had potato fancy graphics or
anything so so I think it's sort of
reasonable but they they probably should
have priced it lower if it is truly
going to be in the four hundred dollar
range because you could buy a real
netbook with its own processor and
whatnot and then you know you can be
talking on the phone in one hand and
then poking in the other yeah yeah
absolutely I suppose the real test for
this or the result of whether this is
successful is whether in you know six
months a year we still see this product
for sale whether we still whether we see
additional Motorola phones come out with
this capability I I'm going to predict
that it's not going to be successful but
Evan you seem to disagree and I guess
it's kind of impossible to determine say
it's going to be success but I I think
they will sell some of them and I think
it'll probably be more popular than say
a folio or red fly because it's being
marketed one thumping market is an
accessory that you know is motorola
brandon and is meant to go with the
phone as opposed to these other things
which were you know especially Celia
which was sort of a third party thing
you know you're not quite sure how your
how your phone is going to interact with
it and there were some problems there
with their OS so I'm not their OS just
beyond the configuration between her or
the communication between the devices so
I think that this will this will be more
successful than those but
I don't think it's going to be a blowout
hit but um no no well I i think that
unless it's a blowout hit we're not
going to see it come back because if
they saw 10,000 of these things they're
gonna they're going to sigh and you know
go to their accounting and say okay we
have to write down all the money we
spent on RD for this thing in
development I mean this thing has to
sell a lot for it to be tonight I
actually probably have it figured out
exactly how many of these they need to
sell / you know hundred atrix is sold
and if it's above that number then it's
considered success if it's below no this
is all it's all set up ahead of time I'm
not sure that that are metric of success
is going to be the same as Motorola's
you know they might think that if you
sell one dock for every thousand atrix
as does you know that's their target and
if they do better than that you know
damn successful well curious to hear
from the people listening to this leave
a comment let us know if the atrix dog
or the atrix laptop is something that
appeals to you along those lines we're
going to start doing Collins in the near
future for the pocket cast so that we
can actually have people come in and
talk about it rather than listen to us
yet about what we think so let's move on
on that note to the final thing we've
got for today iOS 4.3 potentially coming
for the iPhone and the iPad and all
those other iOS devices on februari 14th
and of course that will bring the
personal hotspot feature and also more
importantly I think is the the gesture
support Evan you are a iphone user
currently well you got Hawaii ghatal
everyone know that ah sorry what only a
nice eve in front of America no I like
my iphone no I don't particularly care
for all the gestures stuff and I don't
you know I'm not going to be using it as
a mobile hotspot so so none of these
things interest me particularly but you
know I think at this point iOS is very
polished and you know there's not these
huge features that they can add to a
like in the beginning when we add copy
paste now or multitasking like you know
most of the the basic smartphone
features and some more advanced ones are
already taken care of so so now they're
sort of adding you know value-added
features or what some people would
consider about your added features I
don't see any reason for for the
gestures I mean okay to finger gestures
are okay three fingered registers to
update let's say it's okay but four or
five finger gestures on a small screen
of a smartphone that's hilarious so I'd
rather and this might sound strange I'd
rather use that no style Inga and
actually haha with my nose with the
iphone rather than have a five finger
gesture to bring up I don't know test
manager or something I i unlocked my
phone today with my nose thinking how
cool would be to have that our newest
dialer application um so pocket now
gives a one finger death fair to the
multi finger gesture but we were you I
you guys do but um I've got a I think
that ok so the multi fingers is kind of
annoying especially people with large
hands but the idea of being able to you
know as an additional way to multitask
swipe right swipe left I mean usually
when you're multitasking you're bouncing
between three apps at the most maybe the
web the email and your contacts list or
something and in in Android in iOS you
have to do some action that is kind of
unnatural DoubleTap of the home button
in iOS a tap and hold of the home button
in Android to get up your your list of
previously used applications to swipe
right to swipe left that is so fast and
easy and I really hope it's they're
going to have this in iOS 4.3 and I hope
it comes to android or some third-party
developer figures out how to do it I
left you guys saw Brandon's clearly more
cutting edge but not now I think this
least I'm Tony and I are getting kind of
old yeah okay um I mean so I I'm excited
for iOS 4.3 although my micro sim is
dead and I
can't use my iphone because i
deactivated my AT&amp;amp;T account to use
google voice so I'm not even on 4.2
actually you are living in the past man
well I was waiting for this jailbreak
which untethered jailbreak which it
looks like just happened this weekend so
it looks like i will be upgrading soon
have you done any really cool amazing
jailbreak tricks i know i basically at
first I just kind of did it because I
didn't want to it was more you know for
the not to actually I've done it but
just to him for to make myself sort of
feel better than up high having moved
from windows mobile 6.5 which is really
unlocked oh yeah I sort of did you know
just just the heck of it but I have put
a few apps on there nothing you know
totally exciting I think the most
exciting thing that you can do with it
is is to trick the phone into thinking
that it's on Wi-Fi when it's actually on
3g oh that's good that that seems to
come in handy for quite a few on for
quite a few applications but shutting
than that I mean there's for the average
person there's not a huge need to
jailbreak because you know there's so
many apps that do you know almost
everything that you need you know just
on your regular non jailbroken phone
absolutely I I want to add a bonus topic
and I'm calling a bonus because if
people want to leave us now we're at the
hour mark then that's fine but on the
topic of front-facing cameras I was
going to write a bit of an editorial
about this um it's funny because you
know the story the story briefly goes
that in Europe they had front-facing
cameras well before they did in the
United States and Tony will tell you
that it's a feature that's okay to have
but you don't you don't use it that much
as that is that our third one right and
then so in the US we started see
front-facing cameras with the evo 4g
they were first and you had quick video
chat and then the iphone 4 had facetime
and now a lot of the new high-end
smartphones are having video chat but
like anyone that I know that has a front
facing camera has used it one or two
times and they only used it those those
one or two times just to see what it's
like um I I kind of I kind of think that
front facing cameras are going to go
away soon I know it's a value-add and
it's good for marketing material but no
one's using it and what do you guys
think I suggest they start to get tied
in more to on the desktop applications
which is starting to happen now that you
know Skype is bringing video calling to
to the handsets and FaceTime has you
know opened up to up to max as well I
think it'll start getting used more as
there's more interoperability between
the platforms you know if I if I can
talk to someone on Android not just
another dinosaur iOS user I might be
more I'm fine to do it that being said
you know in general I think there's only
there's only a very small portion of the
population that that wants to make
regular regular calls you know the
technology has been around for landline
video calls for years and years and no
one wants it and there's a reason for
that it's inconvenient i and it's
inefficient that you know people like
text messages so much because boom you
get it done you don't have to say hello
how are you because no one likes to talk
to each other these days it's the future
and so video chat takes it to the
opposite extreme you got to see their
face you got to make sure your hair is
done up or your pants are on or whenever
you're doing that that would be a deal
breaker for you Brandon yeah what do you
what do you think about a front-facing
cameras Tony I just calculating
something here and I was about to ask
you something well we have the front
facing cameras in Europe for four years
now and as you said I agree I used it
let's say for three or four times in my
life first one was for testing purposes
and second one was maybe for me to
justify where I where I was and maybe
this thing to get more popular if the
rates were lower could you tell me
approximately what the rates per minutes
are for video calls in the US and
schedule eating to make comparison with
the with Romania freezes well I mean
making a video call is doesn't cost
anything beyond it will
you know if you're using if you're using
iOS phase or any of these it's just
using your data so it doesn't actually
cost I think that's actually a
difference that a lot of people aren't
aware of in Europe you actually have to
pay per minute for video chat we're in
the US has just built over the internet
connection well in Romania for instance
let's say Vodafone because I'm a hoarder
phone subscriber we bait around 0.3 17
this is US dollar sense for one minute
of video going so uh wonder why they're
not using it hmm well that's a big
roadblock yeah and another another
roadblock is that wasn't facetime
supposed to become open it yeah has that
it's uh it's on max now right oh no I
mean I think that'll be I'm not PC is to
go well I meant I mean you know Steve
Jobs when he had the keynote in in
whatever month it was last year talk
about the iphone 4 he said face time
would be open so other OEMs presumably
HTC and Samsung could enter eight this
in integrate this integrate this into
other operating systems and it just
hasn't happened yet yeah the to my
knowledge that has not happened here and
and that's a really big missed
opportunity because you know everyone's
using skype chat or no no one's you
having going with our thesis that no
one's using this stuff you get quick and
skype and another other things like that
final note i just got an email back from
AT&amp;amp;T about this issue and i'm scanning
it real quick you're going to see the
post on pocket now sunday evening I'm
kind of excited about this post because
it's a little bit a little bit annoying
and slightly outraging this is happening
let me just scan this blah blah blah ok
so what our water contact is done is
appropriately pasted their stance on
hspa+ which is that you know let's see
AT&amp;amp;T is the only company committed to
delivering 4G using both hspa+ and LTE
which is great not really answering my
question about why the inspire 4G is
constantly showing an h+ when it's not
on the hspa+ but I'm going to look
closer at that nothing really stands out
in this email well you because if it
technically is on the hspa+ network it's
just not getting those fees I mean to me
it seems like you know it's like when
you're out the baseball game you know
you can get four bars but you might not
be able to make a phone call so you're
you know you're getting a signal it's
just not that the signal that you know
you're expecting alas I don't think
that's the case because if i go into
mobile network settings it clearly shows
that i'm on hsdpa i think it's just a
simple matter of the indicator being
misleading just that's that's it so it's
the same item for for two different
types of connection yeah in fact there
is no 3g icon i was looking through the
manual that they sent which is something
that I never ever do and the the system
indicators are either H+ and I'm reading
this off the manual which says 4g
available or h plus with two arrows
which means you're connected to 4g I
mean that's kind of okay fired up but ok
not me whatever we care too much about
phones everybody and details details
details that's what matters yes all
right so I think that concludes the
second pocket cast hopefully you enjoyed
this again we're new at this and if we
messed up or didn't do something you
liked let us know or if you liked it and
you you're looking forward to the next
one let us know that too thank you Tony
and Evan for joining joining me on the
second pocket cast thank you thank you i
refer all right and that's it thanks
