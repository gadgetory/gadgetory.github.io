apples complete retail strategy Samson
surprises us with more lollipop updates
ahead of the galaxy s6 an apple seems to
be ready to reinvent the smartphone
camera with the next iPhone I'm hi Mary
vetta and yeah after yesterday's
hangover Tuesday's seems much better
even though it's not Friday this is
parked out daily brought to you by Linda
calm the official news today our kind of
a shocker Samsa has never been famous
for updating its bold smartphones before
they launch new ones such as the case of
the galaxy to widen up but the company
has just the pretty much launched the
Android 5.0 lollipop update for the
galaxy note 4 on AT&amp;amp;T hopefully it'll be
available to you today we still haven't
been able to verify it on our review
unit then no my galaxy note edge has not
received it on AT&amp;amp;T yet but yeah we are
still days away from the galaxy s6 em
it's cool to see that we are getting
updates a company that's not really
enjoying very much hi publicity when it
comes to newer versions of his operating
system is microsoft and windows sent for
mobile there was a lot of fanfare for
the whole preview of Windows 10 for
mobile of the first couple of months but
sadly there are some statistics that
prove that the install base of Windows
10 has dropped four point two percent to
just point one percent this month
because people are losing interest and
if you asked me why number one has to do
with the phones that are supported
number two it has to do with how bad it
is microsoft needs to fix a lot of it
and well that's the point of a preview
right that was moved to spotlight over
to Oppo as yeah the company innovated
with the Oppo r5 with bringing us the
Finnish smartphone in the world but that
wasn't it we've got some links of the
Oppo r7 already since they seem to want
to jump to numbers with every new
version and hey there are no bezels on
this display it is a true shocker and
hopefully it is real we'll keep you
posted as we might see a launch soon
Apple is up next as we've got some
leaked documents that talk about the
company's whole retail strategy for the
Apple watch and all the trainings that
the company's employees will receive the
next couple of weeks and
they're changing everything I mean hey
in the past that was a regular for you
to just be a geek like you and me and
become an apple store employee and just
tell people sell computers smartphones
and a couple of other gadgets but now
things are going to change these people
are learning techniques on how to sell
luxury products and then the list is
vast as to everything that'll do to help
people choose the right Apple watch up
to the point of not talking about price
tags really interesting links in the
description read the full thing because
there are a lot of changes as to how
Apple plans to sell things going forward
and yeah it does prove that they did
hire a lot of people from the fashion
business for a reason and finally for
the very hot news of the day Apple has
just been granted a new patent that was
fought back in 2011 over how to bring
not only optical image stabilization to
its next iPhone but even optical zoom
without making the phone bulkier it's a
whole different ballgame here we're
talking about an l-shaped sensor here
the light will enter the same way it
enters any current iPhone camera or
smartphone camera for that matter but
then the whole module is l-shaped being
the sensor is not really facing the lens
it's actually on the side in a way that
creates sort of like a periscope design
that allows not only optical image
stabilization through the lens but also
the fact that yeah you can have some
sort of zoom here now Apple is famous
for not really launching all of its
patents but this one makes a lot of
sense we just wonder if it will be able
to implement it I phone cameras have
been famous ever since the iphone 4 but
it leads me to the question of the day
what is your current smartphone and are
you satisfied with a camera quality in
my case guys I am testing the Galaxy
Note edge it is probably one of the best
smartphone cameras I've ever tested
hence I'm the guy that also tested the
lumia 930 leave us a comment down below

pro in Adobe tools or learn web designer
