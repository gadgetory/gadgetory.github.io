let's go take a look at Sprint's latest
phone it's the samsung epic 4g alright
so Brandon already showed you a lot of
this stuff but I want to go over it a
little bit more in detail this is the
packaging that the sprint epic 4g comes
in this is a 4g phone using sprint's
wimax network but it's also a samsung
galaxy s series phone now unlike most
galaxy s's this one has a physical
keyboard so you can clearly see on the
box the box is a little bit busy on the
front has a logo over on this side with
some social networking icons and then
same thing over here with the AMOLED and
whatnot bottom of the box completely
empty and top of the box as a bunch of
barcodes that I'm not going to go into
detail with the back of the box has all
of this information so just very basic
but let's get on to the good stuff first
thing I want to show you is your little
power adapter now this is a wall wart it
is not grounded so it'll fit neatly in
any any power plug without taking up too
much space with regular wall warts
you've got a problem where you plug the
thing in and it blocks two or three
outlets and it's a hassle to plug in you
know a couple of those near your search
strip is full so this is nice its
compact it's relatively heavy kind of
deceptively heavy for its size but there
you've got your little USB power port in
it now of course it's got a USB cord
that goes along with it there is the
normal side and then micro USB on the
other end now of course you can plug
this into your computer or you can plug
this in right here just like so but
let's move on next is the unusual thing
that we found in the package and that is
this little guy it is a samsung branded
micro SD SD adapter so you can take the
micro SD card that comes with the camera
it's a 16 gigabyte class too so not that
fast but pretty good size take this pop
it out and plug it into anything that
has a nice
SD card slot in it for you so you don't
have to go through anything proprietary
you don't have to load any drivers or
software if you're plugging it into a
USB so very convenient especially if you
want to get those pictures off while on
your vacation pop the microSD I'll pop
it in there take it to the kiosk and
you're good to go next we've got these
really cool headset and I was not
fighting with the tangled mess off
camera here I was really impressed with
these first of all they look really slim
really small really nice polished
they've got these nice little squishies
to adapt to the size of your ear for
your noise isolation but coming down
you've got this little guy so this is
down the right side the right headphone
you've got your speaker and your mute
button so you can be listening to music
and get a phone call you've got your
speaker right there you can mute it if
you need to ask somebody something in
the middle of the phone call very nice
the cord length is reasonable not too
long and then of course you've got one
of these newer slim line jacks on the
other end of course with the multiple
bars in here for the right and left and
the microphone audio as well you also
get this little bag that comes with a
little bit smaller and a little bit
larger pair of squishies so you can
adapt those to your ears as needed so
that's kind of cool but I know you're
not interested in all that you want to
get to the phone so we're going to
divide this review up into a hardware
review and a software review starting
out here with the hardware that's the
phone and it's just gorgeous put it
right next to the nexus one and I'm
doing this kind of offset for you for a
reason they'll show you in just a minute
the size is pretty much the same as far
as height goes you're looking at just a
teeny bit longer as far as width goes
it's about the same width maybe a little
bit more where you get into a difference
here is in the thickness now the
thickness is because of the sliding
keyboard now this is a spring assisted
keyboard which is very nice that means
you start pushing it up and it'll finish
popping up you start
down it'll finish popping down on the
droid two it's not you slide it that far
and you get that much so you've got to
push it all the way this is kind of nice
it's a little bit faster to actuate the
keyboard and it's very very smooth I've
got to give Samsung kudos for that once
you're inside you've got a very
responsive keyboard I don't know if you
can hear the click eNOS of that but it
gives you just enough tactile feedback
and enough sound feedback to know that
you were actually pushing the buttons
and it feels really good under finger
think I don't like about this is it's in
a grid it's not staggered like you'd
find on a normal keyboard which is kind
of frustrating both my wife and I both
when we were typing it found ourselves
hitting the wrong key because we were
touch typing on it and it was in the
wrong spot that's something that I'm
sure you overcome just by using it a
little bit more so not not too big of a
thing but something to keep in mind one
thing where Samsung really wins and this
I can't give them enough credit for this
you've got your android buttons right
over here including this directional
tpad so you've got your menu button back
home and search right there on your
keyboard and then you've got your cursor
navigation over here you don't really
have a cursor per se but you can
navigate between fields and between
hyperlinks using this as well so it's
really convenient you've also got a
little smiley face i key on the keyboard
there so that's kind of nice let's get
on to the rest of the phone first of all
you'll notice this screen is big and
gorgeous when we do the software review
i'll show you more how gorgeous it is
you can't see it right now all that much
but i've got a few fingerprints and
smudges on this screen they don't show
up at all when the screen is on it's
amazing that's one of the biggest
problems that I have with my nexus one
is this thing is a fingerprint magnet I
ask now clean it wipe it get rid of
those those fingerprints to three times
a day but with the Samsung it it blurs
up just like you'd expect that when that
light is on
you don't have to worry about it at all
now another thing to note you've got
this entire surface this is all one
glass piece with a little cutout up here
for your speaker your microphone is
buried way down here so it's not on the
front at all and there aren't any
buttons here any physical buttons now
i'll show you in the software review
here you actually have a menu button
home a back and a search button just
like you do over on the nexus one except
you can't see him here they're not
physical buttons that you can push their
touch sensitive areas of the screen that
when the screen is on you can touch them
on the nexus one you know where they are
all on where they are all the time but
on the epic you can't see them that from
a design perspective is beautiful
because you have this whole flat black
surface that's only ruined by the two
logos and I say ruined because I'm not a
really big logo guy take a look at the
nexus one you don't have any logos on
the front at all you've got your logos
for HTC and Google on the back so flip
this over you've got your Galaxy S and
your sprint 4G logos on the back as well
some other information we'll get to but
they don't need to be here that's just
overkill and it really takes away from
just how clean and beautiful this screen
is especially when it's on but these
buttons you have to touch somewhere to
activate them and then touch again to
take that text input or that that button
input kind of frustrating you've got
some LEDs some ambient light sensors and
then of course the front-facing camera
that I'll show you more about in the
software review so stay tuned for that
but let's get on to looking at the sides
in the back underneath we've already
showed you right there is your
microphone over on the side you have
your physical camera button something
that I really really like I don't have
one of those on the Nexus so you can
activate the camera app and take the
picture right there using a physical
button very nice up at the top is the
power button now this power button is
not the same as it's not in the same
location as it is on the nexus one which
is kind of hard to
used to I've gotten used to turning on
my phone turning it off using my index
finger now I have to get used to doing
it with my thumb but that didn't take
long at all for me to get used to what
did take a little bit of time is over
here I can push my trackball because I'm
running cyanogenmod and it turns on the
screen over here I don't have that in
fact it took me a while before I
realized there is no trackpad on this
phone there is no big glowing ball to
let you know when you have a
notification like there is on the nexus
one and I thought I would miss that a
lot and really I didn't it's surprising
how much I didn't miss that you might so
I bring that up just in case over here
you've got your volume rocker and it
functions really really well on the top
you've got your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack your multi-purpose jack I'll come
back to this in a minute you've got your
5 megapixel autofocus camera with LED
flash now this is the only galaxy s so
far that has an LED flash on it and it
really really is nice on it's something
I've gotten accustomed to with the nexus
one and for the galaxy s2 finally have
this on the sprint 4G it's very very
worthwhile down on the bottom you've got
your external speaker which I don't like
positioning of external speakers on the
back of the device why when you're
watching something on your device do you
have your sound going away from you you
have to cup your hand behind it to
direct that sound back to the front or
of course have your headphones so let's
go back to this this is a regular
microUSB port that Samson has amped up
with some bells and whistles we'll talk
about those in a while too but it's got
a door on it and this door is nearly
impossible to use even there I've got it
closed but it's not closed all the way
and I can't get it closed all the way to
open it close it it's it's a pain so I'm
just been leaving it open why they have
that on there I don't know you have to
charge this phone frequently but the
nexus one has theirs right there and
it's not a problem I
don't know you'll also notice you've got
these three gold dots on the bottom of
the nexus one there are no dots on the
bottom of the epic which is kind of a
shame because you you have to have that
door open to charge it inevitably it's
going to be left open once it is open
you can just pop that micro USB cable in
there if it fits securely and snuggly
here's one more place where Samsung did
a great job this is the top of the phone
that is where that it can have this
sitting in a cup holder in your car with
the cord coming out the top and not have
to worry about having the phone upside
down to be able to charge it like you do
with the Nexus so fabulous good job I
wish everyone would do that either in
the top or on the top part of the sides
but I think that it interfere with
buttons so so far so good let's break
into this and this is not an easy
process when we got this originally it
came with a battery pre-installed so
there wasn't any mucking around that had
to be done and when this thing is put
together its put together tight there's
a little thumb tab there we go that you
can get your thumb in but if you've got
the back installed correctly it's it's
snug and tight now before I show you the
innards notice back here you've got your
whole basically for your camera and your
LED there is no plastic or glass or
polycarbonate or anything in there it's
just straight through which is fabulous
over here you've got the lens to the
camera on the nexus one you take off
this back panel and the lens is part of
the back so you've got to clean that and
then once you're on the inside go ahead
and pop that off so this is closed
you've got to clean this you've got to
clean this and there's just a lot more
area where you could have potential dust
or debris or stuff build up Samsung's
idea to raise this out from the back of
the camera and then just have a back
that pivots in place rather than slides
I think is a piece of genius that that's
amazing and I think everybody should do
that it's it's wonderful now
come back over here and you've got first
thing that I noticed is you've got some
external camera connection excuse me
some external antenna connections that
you don't have access to through the
back that's a little bit self-defeating
I would imagine but at least you have
access there's also a fourth one down
here you'll also notice you've got your
microSD slot right there with a nice
little guide to help you get it in and
out again 16 gigabyte class too so what
came with it well just go ahead and
slide that back in now this is a cdma
phone so there is no sim slot anywhere
not even hiding underneath the battery
to activate this phone you've got a call
up sprint you've got to give them the
information you're probably buying it
from them already activated or buying it
from their store so you can just
transfer over your current account to
this so if that's what you're doing
great a couple more things and we'll
move on this is one of the more
confusing things I'm probably reading
this wrong this is a 3.7 volt
lithium-ion battery and to me it looks
like it's 5.5 5 watt hours which that's
a huge battery but either I'm reading it
wrong or they're trying to fool you
because you flip it over and it's a 1500
milliamp hour battery which honestly is
nowhere near enough for this phone this
is an amazingly fast phone so last thing
about the hardware and we'll put this
back on before I go to that snap it all
in place you'll notice this has what I'd
like to call an inverted chin if you're
familiar with the the original google
phones came out for t-mobile and whatnot
they had a little chin leaning out the
g1 for example at that little part of
the phone you remember what I'm talking
about on the bottom of the phone just
kind of stuck forward a little bit kind
of made it look like it was cupped more
to your face well this has got it except
in the opposite it's got this little
chin leaning away from you a little bit
thicker there it actually is really nice
because it gives you a place to kind of
hang on to the phone just 23 finger and
makes it easier to use it in a
one-handed operation so really really
cool i'll touch more on this when we do
the software review but speaking of
hardware this phone has a
Oh to 11 b g and n built into it and I
could really see the end performance on
my home network now the nexus one has
802 11 and capable but you're not going
to unlock it until you have the drivers
for it and those drivers I've only found
coming from cyanogenmod and his team not
from official google releases though I
could be wrong there they might have
slipped it in in the froyo release and I
just don't know these guys it comes just
right there right out of the chute
you've got 802 11 in what you don't have
is 4g which is kind of unusual i did a
factory reset on this phone to make sure
it was exactly like they intended and 4g
is turned off so you have to go in and
turn 4g on when you turn 4g on it turns
Wi-Fi off so you have to choose do you
want Wi-Fi or do you want 4G or do you
want to manually toggle between the two
that's a problem and I don't think it's
necessarily Sprint's fault it's because
as I understand why max uses the 2.5
gigahertz spectrum just like 802 11 X
does be G and n can all sit and behave
nicely on that same frequency I don't
know why 4G can't it's probably going
through the same antenna which is why so
instead of having duplicate antennas in
there you have to toggle it but still
it's a pain in the neck why should I
have to choose between high speed at
home or high speed on the road so I hope
they can address that and I hope it's
not something that's going to require
hardware to do it but overall this is a
very very impressive phone I have some
complaints about the sprint network in
testing this 4G is spotty in my area at
best I had to drive about 20-30 minutes
to get to it but when I did I went from
3g of about nice somewhere around 3 400
kilobit per second up speeds their
excuse me down speeds to about five we
were sometimes a little bit higher
sometimes a little bit lower than five
megabit per second so it's really really
impressive when you've got the coverage
and when it's turned on which it
wouldn't have been turned on because I
use Wi-Fi at home so we're back to the
chicken and the egg problem
other than that call quality was
spectacular just as I expected it's a
really really good phone I don't know if
it's got the two microphones for active
cancellation like the nexus one does I
couldn't see another microphone hole
like on the nexus one you've got this
one down here for your voice and you've
gotten this one back here for the
ambient sounds and then using a software
algorithm it will do noise cancellation
to to make your voice sound better well
over here I didn't see that but they
sounded great both making calls over the
sprint network and using google voice
which of course is VoIP once you get to
the middle but it's still sprint network
on on the end to my phone into their
tower all in all very impressive phone
I've got to give it 4 out of 5 stars
rather than a full 5 out of 5 because of
the whole 4G Wi-Fi issue and because of
the keyboard not having the staggered
keys but for a samsung phone which
normally I am you could even call me a
samsung hater every samsung phone that
I've had in the past I have absolutely
despise they've done their job but
that's about it this phone takes all of
that away if you've looked at the
Samsung phones for tmobile the behold
the whole to this doesn't hold a light
to them I mean it's amazing you look at
this you'll think that it's gorgeous the
screen is actually about yay big but you
can't tell especially when you're
watching a show it just kind of blends
into the background gorgeous overall 4
out of 5 if you're on sprint and you
want a physical keyboard you're not
going with the evo this is the phone for
you if you don't care one way or another
the evo is a great phone but the samsung
epic 4g is every bit as powerful and
every bit as great so for pocket now
taking an early look at the sprint
samsung epic 4g i'm joe leave i don't
you hate it when you're so excited about
a product that you forget to include
some of the important spent no technical
specifications well i did just that this
phone
sprint samsung epic 4g has a 1 gigahertz
hummingbird processor which is
ridiculously fast it's every bit as fast
as the qual comes and whatnot in the
other phones it's got half a meg and
half a gig rather of ram and half a gig
of rom on board and it is just a
spectacularly fast phone like i
mentioned it is cdma it runs on the
sprint nextel network you can see a
whole bunch more detailed specifications
including the height width depth the
weight all that fun stuff in the article
related to this video you can check the
video notes to see a hyperlink over to
those specifications and of course if
you like this video go ahead and give it
a thumbs up if you have not yet
subscribed to our video channel now is
the time to do it we're getting more and
more of these early looks at the
production devices and that's what this
is this is a production phone it is not
a pre-release or a demo model phone this
is a production model this is what
you're going to see on the shelves when
it is officially released if you want to
