9 bringing fortnight to Android on
August 9th on its impact event it looks
like if Apple is ready to fully jump the
ship from Qualcomm to Intel modems and
we're kind of worried about that and
it's Black Friday at Best Buy yeah I
know the dates are off but it's Black
Friday at Best Buy I'm Jaime meta Rivera
and definitely thank you so much for
your support to the Spanish Channel
again you can subscribe and hit that
Bell icon we are trying to get you
videos every day in Spanish as well
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals because a
Best Buy has Black Friday and July
they're New Deal that's actually
exclusive to only Best Buy members so
for those of you that don't have one
that just getting the account is free
online go for it there are a ton of
deals particularly with Apple products
you can learn more about everything in
the description now let's talk about
Samsung we've been covering the rumors
of the galaxy x foldable smartphone
since I don't know since forever since
this show exists now we've got rumors
that there are up to four variants we
heard the galaxy x was probably gonna be
for gamers now we hear that that's
probably true that there is also a
galaxy f4 foldable for everybody else
and then we also hear that the Chinese
market might get other variants like the
R and the piece they tuned that's
actually gonna be very very interesting
and since we're talking Samsung one of
our major complaints with the Galaxy
Note line hint there is an after the
buzz coming very soon on the note 8 its
battery life honestly I mean it's not
that it's terrible but it's not great
for a portable note pad and that's the
whole purpose of the note line the
company is teasing that you're will have
great battery life on the galaxy note 9
and oK we've got the clock up snapdragon
845 which on its own is great in
addition to a possible larger battery at
four thousand milliamp hours let's just
hope that all that UI and operating
system deliver and since we talked about
Qualcomm we've got some drama going on
because I am the type of person that
really does not like Intel modems on
iPhones mainly because of the terrible
performance it's bad battery life it
doesn't connect to cell towers it's good
there was even a study from Ookla
recently published now we hear that
Apple has made it official they will
focus on Intel modems going forward in
our ditching Qualcomm yeah I I am really
worried about this I hope intel has
figured their stuff out because it's
just it's I wish you if you haven't
tested the difference it is just so
dramatic but we'll see what happens and
finally the hottest news today have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 once
again and fortnight we were expecting
for this game to launch on Android today
I was looking forward to it now we hear
rumors that there is an exclusive deal
between Epic Games and Samsung with the
launch of the Galaxy Note 9 we even hear
that ninj is gonna be there announcing
the game I'm I don't know i don't like
exclusive deals because obviously
everybody else is not going to take
advantage of this and we don't know for
how long but in today's question let us
know what do you think I mean do you
like the fact that fortnight is going to
probably launch exclusively will you
prefer it to launch on every platform I
think that question and answer is
obvious but definitely as well will
fortnight make you buy a Galaxy Note 9
if they said they'll hold it for six
months because in my case yeah I think I
probably would leave us a comment down
below we left in on your opinion friends
