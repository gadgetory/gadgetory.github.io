pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the software tour
of the Verizon XV 6900 we're going to
take a look at the programs that are
included on the device and in part two
we're gonna take a look at touch flow
including flick scrolling and other
touch enhancements now I could use the
stylus to operate the device but hey
it's an HTC touch so why don't I use my
finger so let's start here I'm gonna
zoom in a little bit this is the HTC
home today's screen
the HTC home plug-in is a good today
screen enhancement on the first tab we
have access to our messaging so we can
go right to our email or we can go right
to our text messaging and over here we
can go to our missed calls on the second
tab we can go to weather and here I'm in
Philadelphia 75 degrees and if you click
this right arrow we get a four day
forecast the next step over we have an
application launcher and you can add add
applications by clicking the plus button
and it'll bring you to a list and
finally we have a profile selector so if
you want to leave your phone on vibrate
if you're in a meeting or turn off the
ringer completely you can do it from
there also down here we have a button a
shortcut to the phone and I really like
this phone skin the buttons are large so
you can use your finger to to type
numbers we have a link to call history
if we go to to the second button here we
can do a device lock so right now I
can't do anything with a device because
it's locked and to unlock it I press
unlock down here and then press unlock
again on the screen usually though I
just pressed the power button on the top
of the device to shut it off so that I
don't accidentally press a button in the
center here we have another link to
messaging although we have one over here
as well I don't understand why we need
to if we click on the shopping cart we
go to mobile tank and Ango calm if we
want to buy some software for our device
looks like Verizon has a deal with
handing go and to the right we have a
photo gallery which is much better than
the default photo gallery for Windows
Mobile and we're going to talk about
that in part 2 of the video now if you
notice in the upper right corner we have
the HTC task manager it's fantastic as
you know with Windows Mobile devices
when you
press the X in the upper right corner it
doesn't actually close the program well
with this we can set using the little
wrench picture it'll bring us to a
setting that will allow us to have the
button and the program the way I have it
now is is if I want to end a program you
have to tap and hold the X otherwise it
just goes into hibernation mode so if
you want to see how much program memory
you have or if you want to close some
program so that you get back some
program memory you can do it from this
task manager here okay so let's go into
programs as you can see it's operating
quite well with just the touch of a
finger
we've office mobile and it includes
OneNote mobile going down the list we
have Adobe Reader for PDFs camera
Communication Manager which actually is
dressed up quite nicely so you hear if
you're going on an airplane you can turn
off all your connections you can turn on
Bluetooth it doesn't have Wi-Fi the xc60
900 unfortunately does not have Wi-Fi so
that's why you don't find it in the
Communication Manager movie mobi TV
doesn't come on the device I downloaded
that separately modem link is for
tethering to your laptop or your desktop
if you want to get an internet
connection through the e video radio on
the device going down some more we have
a running programs application which is
basically the same as the HTC task
manager just looks a little bit
different we have voice speed dial which
unfortunately has to be trained it's not
Microsoft voice command and if we go
down further we have wireless sync which
is kind of like Microsoft Exchange but
for people that don't have it I don't
like using that because you have to
install a program on your desktop in
order to get the wireless sync which
lets you sync your email contacts and
calendar data that sort of thing and on
the bottom we have an application to
make zip files so that's pretty much it
in programs let's go into settings ok
let's go to the top standard standard
and here's something that's different
large start menu as it is set now the
Start menu has large buttons good for
touch so if we want to take that off and
perhaps use the stylus
you can make it smaller and fit more
programs there but I like to have it on
the large Start menu so that I can use
my finger going down the list everything
else is pretty much standard except here
voice speed dial this is where you go to
train the voice speed dial and
unfortunately you have to do it one by
one and that's a very tedious process I
rather just use microsoft voice command
here on the system tab everything is
pretty much standard error error
recording hard to say make sure you have
that turned off it slows down your
device going down the list here's
something different long press end key
this will specify what happens when you
press the end button down here so as
it's set now if I press the end button I
get what's called the quick list so here
I can lock the device or end the data
connection to save battery life turn on
vibrate or if we go to settings it will
take you right back to the long key
press dialog box we can also have it do
other things like lock the device or
well pretty much anything you see in the
quick list I'll leave that as default
going down the list we have a setting
for touch flow but we're going to go
through that later in part two of the
video let's go to memory see how much we
have free right now we still have plenty
of memory free even though we're running
a lot of programs 48 megabytes so that's
good and back up to the top and let's go
the connections tab nothing unique this
device does not unfortunately have
integrated GPS in the next video we're
going to talk about flick scrolling and
all of the other touch enhancements that
HTC brings with the Verizon XV 6900
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
