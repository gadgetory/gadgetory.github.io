itself a badge of distinction in a time
when most smartphone screens hover
somewhere around five inches and even
longtime holdouts have gotten into the
super-sized game it's not enough just to
be big you've got to be smarter than the
average smartphone you've got to be
special and maybe just maybe you've got
to have a stylus is the fourth
generation of Samsung's famous phablet
line worth your time and your money
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
find out in our video review of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 okay so this is
the best Galaxy Note ever made of course
it is that's how annual upgrades work if
it wasn't there would be a problem but
what does that mean well for one thing
it means samsung has finally addressed
one of our longest standing gripes fit
and finish the polycarbonate backplate
is still done up in a fake leather
pattern to fit in with the whole
notebook aesthetic but last year's
stitch work and plated plastic is out in
its place a seamless joint meeting an
aluminum magnesium bezel with painted
detail and a gorgeous double chamfer
have we seen this design before oh yeah
are we worried about it scratching over
time absolutely we've already got a few
dings in our review unit in fact but one
will never get tired of design that
looks this good and too soft metal or
not it's got to take damage better than
the cheap plastic on the note three and
you better believe you're going to drop
it the note 4 is thicker and heavier
than most smartphones on the market and
reaching across its 5.7 inch display
with one hand is a daring endeavor best
suited to the brave or the foolish that
display is a Super AMOLED panel at the
super-high resolution that's become a
necessity for top-tier smartphones and
yes it's exactly as beautiful as the
manufacturer says it's dimmable too
almost absurdly low levels it's bright
enough to read in broad daylight
and it's protected by a layer of
material that Sampson tells us is more
robust than Gorilla Glass 3 but that
didn't stop us from scratching it when
we dropped it accidentally that glass
extends almost to the metal border with
a tiny expansion gap that's caused a big
stir you've probably read about it well
we're not really worried about it it is
a little concerning from the standpoint
of dust inversion so we'll keep an eye
on it for after the buzz in a few months
finally embedded in the glass is a Wacom
digitizer capable of over 2000 levels of
pressure sensitivity which gives life to
the s-pen silo'd in the phone's bottom
edge that special stylus is a big part
of what makes a note and note so let's
talk about it real quick
Samsung keeps adding features to the
s-pen suite but its core function is the
same as fun as drawing on a screen can
be it's the navigation function that we
like best we've said it before using the
S Pen as a pointer for ordinary actions
like scrolling and selecting feels much
like using a mouse on a computer and
Samsung has added to that experience
this year with a new highlight function
that makes it easier to copy and paste
text or to look up words in the
dictionary that kind of stuff comes in
handy more often than you'd think
and so do other abilities like
annotating photos or using swipe on the
keyboard it's stuff like this rather
than the party trick nonsense that makes
us sad to leave the Galaxy Note behind
after a review period every year even
though we wouldn't use it all the time
we wish every smartphone could have an S
Pen it's much more than a simple stylus
where the note 4 stumbles is when it
tries to do too much and here Samsung
can't help but fall back on old habits
the company's third party UI is just so
heavy that it can't avoid keeping you
waiting especially in the rebranded
magazine now called briefing and the
multitasking ribbon which has been
redone to resemble the latest version of
Android now this is a very common issue
we've yet to meet a smartphone that
doesn't lag at some point but Samsung
phones always seem to start bogging down
early which is concerning considering
how much power phones like this are
packing
and what you get in exchange for that
performance hit are features that all
too often seem incomplete scrolling with
the s-pen only works in certain apps
tossing content between apps is the same
story functionality is duplicated all
over the system making the phone more
confusing than it needs to be
while the company deserves some leeway
for including features that few others
are bringing to the table it's getting a
little old giving Samsung a pass on
design in exchange for capability the
competition isn't standing still after
all if you're the kind of power user the
note line was created for maybe you'll
adapt easily to the interface quirks if
so you'll get a feature package that
makes the note feel like much more than
an ordinary big screen smartphone you
can toss apps into resizable windows
shrink them down to floating orbs or
divide them across the screen so you can
keep an eye on facebook while you're
watching YouTube throw photos from the
gallery to an Evernote memo use s finder
to search the entire system for one
search term when the note 4 remembers
that it's a powerhouse it can do some
awesome stuff and it looks better doing
it than previous generations to new
transparencies and minimal design give
it a more modern feel if you use the
stock launcher and the briefing app is
so hip looking that you may forgive its
sluggishness as we expected the note 4
also brings many of the improvements
from the Galaxy s5s health is more
capable than ever thanks to the note 4's
heart rate blood oxygen and UV sensors
and even if you can't make sense of that
data the coach is back to tell you to
get off your Duff every hour and move
around a little bit fatty the
fingerprint scanner is still an awkward
swipe sensor but it works much better
now than when it debuted in the spring
and speaking of features there's a whole
menu section devoted to making the phone
easier to use with one hand on a device
is why does this shrinking the screen to
within a thumbs reach is more than a
clever add-on it's almost a necessity
and this is a feature even you lefties
can appreciate if you can master the
tricky activation gesture
same with the side key panel that slides
out from the bezel which would be much
more useful if you could trigger the
notification shade with it maybe in a
future update with a 16 megapixel sensor
and the fancy optical image
stabilization we love to see the note
4's camera isn't lacking for hardware
and as usual Samsung has backed it up
with plenty of controls on the software
side - in terms of design this huge
closely to what's happening in the rest
of the UI
it's pared down and modernized a little
bit but it's got a ways to go to catch
up with some of the competition's
usability this being 2014 selfie centric
options abound you've narcissists you
can squeeze more people into the frame
of the wide-angle 3.7 megapixel front
facing a much mo if you have any friends
or you can take a detailed self-portrait
with the main camera using audio and
vibration cues once you get over
yourself you can start taking pictures
of the world around you and hear the
note fours fancy hardware really pays
off colors are luscious contrast is rich
and automatic settings keep up really
well with most environments that optical
stabilization makes taking photos and
video much smoother through the
viewfinder and combined with faster
autofocus and some software magic it
makes low-light photography a real
pleasure the note 4 is still a big
device so it's a little awkward to shoot
with for the hundredth time we'd really
like to see a hardware camera button
here rather than the hacky solution of
using the heart rate sensor as a shutter
key also the audio tends to peak more
than on other phones when shooting video
in loud environments all told that's a
pretty short list of complaints for a
smartphone camera habitual shutter bugs
and budding cinematographers will
probably be very well served by the note
4's optics
just like Keanu Reeves showed us in
speed sometimes being taller makes all
the difference and the few millimeters
of added height on this year's note make
it slightly more comfortable as a phone
the sharp edges aren't the greatest on
the ear but sound quality is fairly
clear and plenty loud on our end and
callers reported that we came through
the same way loud to the point of
clipping but not as clear as some other
phones noise cancellation is thankfully
solid through both handset and
speakerphone modes and speaking of
speakers samsung's decision to move them
back to the back is kind of annoying but
the component is loud enough that it's
not a deal-breaker even if you're
someone who uses a lot of loudspeaker
that's our favorite background track
from one of our favorite games and
gaming is of course a delight on
hardware this powerful our american
review unit packs the potent combination
of a Snapdragon 805 with an Adreno 420
and three gigs of ram every game we
threw at it the note 4 ran wonderfully
and with microSD expansion up to 128
gigs you can install plenty of titles to
external memory if you're willing to
take a few extra steps it's also really
nice to know that your battery won't die
after a half hour of gameplay and the
note 4 stamina is fine it's got the
swappable battery common to Samsung
phones so you can carry a spare if you
need it and it also brings the super
efficient ultra power saving mode for
dire endurance emergencies over seven
days of testing we've usually been able
to hit five hours of screen on time
after a 16 hour day which is good the
note will probably get you through the
day just don't go trying to last all
weekend with it with the Galaxy Note 4
Samsung has reasserted its dominance of
the phablet market it helped create it's
not just another jumbo phone it's a
bundle of features so dense it should
probably come with an old-style
500 page instruction manual but you
wouldn't read that and despite its
quirks the note 4 really is friendly
enough that you wouldn't
- this is a smartphone for power users
yes for people who want one device
instead of a phone and a tablet then
it's even a device for people who don't
want a computer to an extent anyway more
than any of that though the note 4 is a
smart phone for people who love smart
phones and in that respect it's the best
one Samsung's ever made just like every
year there's so much more to the Galaxy
Note that we didn't cover here so go
check out the rest in our full note 4
review available at pocket now on
