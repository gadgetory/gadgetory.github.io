one on the back and one on the front
these are not professional quality at
all so this is an lane for packing.com
and in order to take some real
professional quality pictures I'm going
to use my surface pro to control a DSLR
so over here I have camera control pro 2
for nikon that's the camera that i have
connected as a d7000 you see there and i
have it plugged into the USB port if i
had a wireless adapter i could do this
through Wi-Fi but i'm just gonna use a
USB here and I have it set as a manual
exposure mode so I can change things
like aperture let's go for 1.8 exposure
compensation flash all that stuff and
you see my settings down here and we
also have some more exposure controls
over here I can choose the metering mode
the ISO sensitivity and you know
everything is pretty much controllable
here I choose RAW format to press record
to PC so that's gonna take a picture
right to the tablet and all my controls
are right there even movie controls now
one thing I did is change the transfer
options I'm gonna send the pictures to a
folder on the tablet and I'm going to
switch to live view so I can see what's
going on and maybe these shutters should
be a little slower and you can see the
effect is changing in the live view you
make a little brighter
so there's the live view of my camera we
see my hand is moving around and this
gives us some cool options I can change
the size of the viewfinder here auto
rotate focus mode face priority and I
can choose auto focus we can show a
horizon line grid all that now here's a
cool thing I can now I'm focused on that
point and you see the screen is out of
focus now I'm focused on the screen and
then I'll just hit start and it's taking
a picture and that is right here in
bridge and I can hit
open it in Camera Raw and now I can do
some more adjustments let's do some lens
profiling maybe a little exposure
adjustment how about some white balance
changes sure and there you go
let's do that again I'm gonna focus on
something else how about that keyboard
right there and I just hit the shutter
and we got another picture and you see
the focus is right there
so that is using these surface pro to
control eight DSLR much better than
these little built-in cameras which you
should probably shouldn't be using for
anything other than Skype video calling
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
