released to the public last week I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is the Ubuntu touch Developer Preview
versus iOS you might be asking why we're
comparing Ubuntu for phones with iOS and
that's a legitimate question I've been
using iOS and Ubuntu side-by-side not
extensively but side-by-side for a
couple of days now and it's very clear
that these operating systems are
complete total opposites it was apparent
after just using the two side-by-side
for just a couple of minutes virtually
everything within these operating
systems is completely and totally
different the home screens applications
and how visually stimulating each one of
them is for one canonical is all about
open source and keeping everything open
and Apple is all about having the walled
garden and making sure that everything
is safe so there are some core
differences that come into play here but
even visually on a graphical standpoint
these two operating systems are complete
total opposites the differences really
begin to show when you press the power
button I Oh SS lock screen has basically
become a utility notifications can be
slid to unlock or you can drag upwards
to open directly to the camera Ubuntu s
lock screen isn't a lock screen it's a
welcome screen and it displays
notifications but that's about it after
you get past these pages that's where
the differences really begin to stack up
Ubuntu is all about content at your
fingertips everything is out in the open
your contacts your favorite applications
music videos and pretty much everything
else is all right there ready to be
consumed without having to dig into
applications iOS is a complete 180 from
that everything is buried with the
applications you can rearrange
everything on your home screen set
wallpapers and you have folders that you
can set other than that the
customization options are pretty slim
however if you want to access any sort
of information you have to open the
applications there's no way to get
information directly on the home screen
one major contrast between these two
operating systems is how you navigate
them on Ubuntu everything is accessed
through a swipe either from the left
right top or bottom of the display you
access your recent applications settings
notifications or you go back a page with
iOS you have one swipe down from the top
of the display to access notifications
and everything else has done through
either on-screen buttons or the physical
button at the bottom of the device
gestures in Ubuntu are very
very fast you can navigate very quickly
however there's a learning curve and
there are so many gestures that
sometimes it gets a little clunky you
try to swipe from one edge to the
discipline to the other but you
accidentally do something that you
didn't want to do with iOS there's
really no way to mess up its click the
home button and you go home click it
twice you can switch applications hold
it open Siri or drag down from the top
of the display to access your
notifications and the on-screen buttons
are very straightforward as they tell
you what to do that's pretty much it
granted one area that Ubuntu excels is
switching applications simply swipe from
the right side of the display left words
and you go back to the previous
application on iOS to go back to the
previous application you have to double
click the home button and then select
the application so it's three clicks by
the time you do that on Ubuntu you could
have switched three four or five
applications it's just that fast and on
iOS there's no quick way to access your
favorite applications without going back
to the home screen on Ubuntu slightly
pull from the left side of the display
and it will reveal a launcher with all
your favorite applications swiped the
rest the way across and you will go back
home although there is a learning curve
once you learn it it is very quick one
thing I found very surprising is how
Ubuntu is camera stores more features
than the iOS camera even at a developer
preview level they're not working
features just yet but they're there and
you can see them simply slide up from
the bottom of the display in the camera
application and you will see features
for white balance and all sorts of other
settings you can toggle while in the
camera application for iOS all you have
is the option to turn on and off a grid
HDR mode flash and switch to the front
camera rear camera or to video mode
another major difference is how you
search for content on the operating
system with in iOS simply slide left
from your main home screen and you will
go to the spotlight feature where you
have a universal search for anything
local or you can perform a web search
using your default search engine the
search button in the top left corner of
the ubuntu interface is relative to what
page you're on if you're at the home
screen the search button does nothing if
you're on the people tab it searches
people if you're on the video tab in
searches videos if you're on the music
tab music and so on and so forth there
is no universal search you have to
navigate to different places to search
for different things but not everything
is totally different the dialer much
like with Android is very similar to the
one to dialer
you have contacts recent activity and
the dialer built into a single
application the notification shade on
iOS is a little different than the one
on Ubuntu the ubuntu notification shade
has a lot more features packed in it you
can respond to text messages Skype
messages and anything from within the
shade and you can toggle your battery
brightness anything from within the
shade but the idea is basically the same
pull down from the top of the display to
access all of your recent messages from
the way that the contacts are displayed
and Ubuntu to the home screen
everything is visually stimulating and
iOS is sort of the opposite of that it
used to be visually stimulating but it
hasn't been updated in a long time and
it's starting to look a little stale the
settings page is very ugly and dated and
it's just not very pleasing to the eye
anymore whereas everything on Ubuntu is
kind of modern and has that webOS appeal
it's lightweight and very friendly
looking neither of these things mean
that one is better than the other Ubuntu
is very early in its development phase
and iOS is a little more weathered but
it's surprising how different these two
operating systems truly are this has
been a comparison of Ubuntu touch and
iOS be sure to give the video a thumbs
