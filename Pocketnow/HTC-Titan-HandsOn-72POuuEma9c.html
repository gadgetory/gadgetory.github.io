pocketnow.com and we are here with the
HTC Titan which was launched yesterday
it's wave to HTC device it was launched
in London it will come shipping with 7.5
that's windows phone 7.5 mango and it's
got is 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor it's got a brand-new camera so
this will be a flagship phone for HTC
running Windows Phone 7 it's got a huge
4.7 inch screen it's really big but it
doesn't feel that big in hand it's
nothing like the samsung galaxy note for
instance so let's take a look at home we
have a speaker grill on the top we have
an LED indicator which is always great
to see if your phone is being charged or
if you have a notification living Nelly
front-facing webcam and this answers
many of our questions because we didn't
know whether mango will work from Pacers
or not but with Microsoft acquiring
skype video calls will be here as the
front facer is present at the bottom we
have the typical back start and search
buttons for windows phone
and on the side you have dedicated
camera button just above it your volume
rockers for volume up and volume down
there's nothing on the left side except
for the USB port for charging and on the
back we have a brand new camera which
HTC let's say advertisers as being a
better camera in terms of low-light
sensitivity it also has a double LED
flash at the top we have the power
button a secondary microphone which is
possibly for noise cancelling and the
3.5 millimeter
now in terms of software many of you may
have tried the mango in its beta or rtm
release this has better integration in
the people help Facebook or Twitter it
has many many new features including
fast app switching as you can see right
here the applications are running in the
background so it's pretty exciting it's
nothing out of the ordinary but it's got
a faster processor and the chipping wood
windows phone 7.5 mango so this was
Anton denied taking at the HTC Titan
