possible specifications of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 1000 time event just happen
then we get a ton of these services from
Cupertino not many details on pricing
and we already get teasers of the Oppo
Reno ahead of a P 30 Pro launch because
you know I'm high metal Iveta and when I
arrived I've told the guy at the desk
man this hotel room is small and he
responded very kindly of Monsieur put
you all in poly and so that I say you're
right
this is parking out daily brought to you
by brave the official loose today begin
with an interesting twist I mean we're
expecting the Galaxy fold to start
pre-orders on April 26 in the United
States no that's gonna happen actually
in Europe and well launch is going to
happen on May 3rd and $2,000 sorry two
thousand euros is gonna be the price and
sure you get a device you'll get Galaxy
buds and Sampson care two thousand year
old man now let's talk about Huawei as
we hear that the company is moving very
quickly towards building both smart
displays and actually even televisions
apparently their division from high
silicon which pretty much makes the
Karen 980 is also going to be in charge
of building chips for televisions that
they're working on this we're not
exactly sure what dates to expect that
but TSMC is involved then apparently
this is gonna happen soon now let's talk
about Oppo as well we're here for the
p30 pro event we've heard rumors that it
brings a periscopic camera but we also
know that Oppo was the first company to
announce this project Reno apparently
will launch on April 10th and they're
teasing it today obviously because
tomorrow is the Huawei event so stay
tuned for that now start about Apple as
well we actually delay the pocket out
daily today just to wait for the Apple
event and well as it turns out we've got
apple news plus we've got Apple TV plus
we've got a ton of subscription service
even Apple arcade there's even an Apple
credit card service working on Apple pay
it's just interesting that the only
service that we got pricing for is Apple
news Plus which is gonna be 990
the rest of everything is gonna be
launching either later or in the fall
and yeah that's that's kind of weird for
Apple to do that we wonder exactly why
but whenever that's gonna happen we'll
keep you posted
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note
1000 all the Samsung Galaxy S 10 5g with
an S Pen as we've got some leaked
specifications that indicate that this
device is pretty much the same Galaxy S
10 5 G the same display would do a punch
hole with the time-of-flight sensor
time-of-flight on the back same cameras
we don't hear anything about the s-pen
in the camera but yeah it seems that
Samsung is going to do this the
interesting part is that we don't hear
that it's going to bring 5g so could it
be that we are gonna get that trade off
for now let us know the comments down
below what do you think do you think
that this is a good idea for the Galaxy
Note 10 in my case I like the Galaxy S
10 5g so I'm down for it but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
