where two new phones were unveiled I'm
Taylor Martin with PocketNow and this is
a quick look at what weighs 299 euro no
compromise smart phone it's too soon to
tell if this phone lives up to the hype
Huawei is building around it but for the
price you'll be getting a lot for your
money in terms of horsepower but in
terms of value adds and build quality
the essentia has an all metal unibody
casing and a curved backside and it
actually feels quite nice in the hand
certainly like you're holding something
worth a little more cash in this phone
the buttons are precision machined the
sim and microSD card traits are made of
aluminum and it's actually quite hefty
165 grams it also has some fairly
impressive guts on the inside it's
powered by 1.2 gigahertz 32-bit
snapdragon 401 SOC not the most powerful
chips had ever but definitely capable
and has two gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of fixed storage cat 4 LTE and
a 3000 milliamp hour battery like many
other OEMs that need for this year
Huawei made sure to make the g7 handset
live up to the selfie fed with a 5
megapixel front camera and an 88 degree
wide angle lens around back as a
wide-angle 13 megapixel BSI shooter from
Sony for such a low price something has
to give in this case it was the display
as a 5.5 inch 720p IPS panel and we
definitely weren't impressed in the
short time we had with it it's vibrant
but contrast seemed a little low on the
floor and viewing angles fell off rather
quickly in certain angles the upshot
however is the new update to emui
version 3.0 it features the host of
changes many of which take from Google's
new material design including the
navigation buttons featured on the
developer preview our initial
impressions are that this new emui is
actually quite nice and lightweight but
we'll need more hands-on time with it to
tell for sure thanks for watching folks
and stay tuned for more on the ascend g7
as well as more Etha coverage here on
pocket now I'm Taylor Martin Kasper tech
on Twitter and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
