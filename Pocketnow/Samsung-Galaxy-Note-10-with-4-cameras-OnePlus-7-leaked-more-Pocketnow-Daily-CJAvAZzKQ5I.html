get rumors of the Galaxy Note tenements
possible for cameras one to us sort of
showed off their 5g device at MWC and it
could be the design of the one plus
seven and Vodafone is defending Huawei
from getting banned in Europe as it'll
set back 5g I'm Jaime Mehta Rivera and
definitely MWC continues being crazy
there's a lot more 5g here this is
parked out daily powered by qualcomm the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for new
MacBook Pros they are currently on sale
in Amazon $200 off in one case 150 on
the other it all depends on the storage
variant that you're looking for you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about ZTE believe it or not the
company did announced an X on 10 5g of
the interesting that there weren't any
invites to the event or whatever the
case may be but yeah there is a 5g foam
from ZT apparently it's slated to launch
in Asia and you're very soon obviously
qualcomm snapdragon 85 with the X 50
modem we'll see when and speaking of 5g
let's talk about oneplus as the company
pretty much demoed their 5g and well the
unit according to sources apparently
could be the prototype design for the
oneplus 7 now we're not exactly sure if
this is going to be the 1 + 7 or the
oneplus 70 but whatever the case may be
let us know in the comments what you
think about the design let's move the
spotlight over to wall way and obviously
the whole political debacle that's been
happening according to Vodafone CEO
particularly in Europe if you let a
company like wall way out of the whole
spectrum and the whole push of 5g this
might set back everything up to five
years for Europe to adopt it obviously
this is up for speculation this is just
what they believe is going to happen
we'll see in the end how that ends up
panning out and finally the hottest news
today have to do with the Galaxy Note 10
which I actually believe because we know
that the Galaxy S 10 the 5g Burien has
that time-of-flight extra camera I
actually like that design and will
actually have a separate hands-on
the 5g Berrien very soon in addition to
that apparently there will also be a
camera in the S Pen not saying that it's
actually going to happen but let us know
in the comments down below what do you
think I mean do you think that it would
be cool to have a camera in the S Pen
and then what would you use it for
because in my case again this for me
feels like that solution in search of a
problem
believe is a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion MWC 2019
brought us a lot of gaming phones and
did you know that a lot of what makes a
gaming phone possible is all powered by
the new Paul Keim stamp dragon 855
mobile platform this is the first
platform to support the Vulcan 1.1
graphics library but first to bring HDR
for gaming the first to bring 4k HDR
plus playback all thanks to the
Snapdragon Elite gaming experience
cinematic color grading means more
realistic games and all the while
improving drop-frame performance by 90%
and improving power efficiency follow
the link in the description below to
learn more about what makes the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 mobile platform so cool
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm out
on comments scripter both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter hi now it's going to be that are
on Instagram but high memory data please
