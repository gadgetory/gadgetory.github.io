and we're going to put the t-mobile g1
android form through our usability speed
tests now the first test is from the
standby position opening the email
contacts and calendar applications as
quickly as possible now this has you can
customize shortcut keys so fastest would
be using those all right right here we
go
this calendar
you know
context
okay good next test is from home screen
opening a third-party application buried
within the interface such as Google Maps
I don't have a home screen that would be
cheating so here we go where you go
actually Vince faster way to do that let
me try that again from the home screen
there you go
much better
android does support searching through
programs with that program drawer open
so that was pretty quick now so the
third test is opening a favorite from
the home screen now you can put
favorites on the home screen directly so
that's possible to speed up this test
but we're going to do it through the
browser because you may have tons and
tons of favorites so ready go menu
bookmarks with a can sweep there it is
so the bookmarking listing does not
support searching with keyboard the
fourth test is playing music by a
specific artist so from our home screen
ready go no all right start over where
you go
music
and artists
now
the weird thing is you can't play
everything from that artist when you
search for them you have to go and
select an album let's show that
so you say I want to play all of his
songs that's not an option here next
we're going to add a new contact contact
number
say
there we go and next is how quickly can
we send an email to that content so when
I want to do it through gmail there you
go
it didn't recognize that there is
contact there turns out our last test is
a little more difficult because android
doesn't want to search for john doe's
last name and either the email or gmail
application so we're going to have to
type by the first name and delete all
the other ones so that you don't have
any John email addresses for you all
right here we go gmail
ok
and take their butt
you see work and no kind of text
prediction for the keyboard there so
that about as long as it would normally
take on a regular keyboard and we had to
use these little buttons but that's it
for the usability speed test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
