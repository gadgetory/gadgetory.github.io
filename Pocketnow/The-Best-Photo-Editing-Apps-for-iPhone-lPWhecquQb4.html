great pictures out of the box but not
every picture turns out exactly as you
were hoping I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and these are the best photo editing
apps for the iPhone the iPhone 5s camera
is regarded as one of the best
smartphone cameras around Nokia's Lumia
920 may win in low-light performance and
a handful of newer smartphones carry a
higher resolution sensor but the iPhone
consistently captures accurate well
balanced shots however not every picture
turns out as intended
maybe the lighting was off or the image
needs a little saturation or color boost
the stock photos application on iOS
comes with a lightweight editor inside
that offers a quick auto fix crop
rotation and redeye fix but its
capabilities are quite slim in the App
Store there are thousands of photo
editing applications that offer all
sorts of additional features for those
looking for an endless array of effects
and filters your one-stop shop is FX
photo studio
other than the really cool homepage it
has a ton of different effects filters
and frames that could be applied to your
photos after you choose a photo and
before you edit you can crop it for
Instagram once you're in the edit mode
you can make the usual adjustments add
text or hit the FX button for a total of
a hundred and eighty-nine different
effects which can be used in conjunction
with one another
meaning the possibilities are virtually
endless and if you don't feel like going
through the very long list of effects
you can simply hit the dice button in
the upper right corner to choose a
random effect and you can keep rolling
until you find the perfect filter
currently FX photo studio is free with
in-app purchases that unlock more
effects but the app store description
notes that it will go back to page soon
Snapseed is one of our all-time favorite
photo editors both on iOS and Android
it's great for super quick edits or more
in-depth tweaks snap C comes with its
own selection of filters frames and
effects but there are two features in
particular that make snap seat so great
the tuned image feature and selectively
adjust the tuned image feature has five
basic categories brightness ambience
contrast saturation and white balance
slide your finger up and down to scroll
and select one sliding your finger left
and right adjusts that element of the
image selectively adjusts is similar but
it limits the adjustments to bright
this contrast or saturation and those
are only applied to the specified area
of the photo it's quick and easy to use
but it offers one of the best user
experiences for photo editing we've seen
to date that could be why Google
purchased the creator's Nik software and
added some of Snapseed features to the
Google+ application Snapseed is now
completely free
another photo editing app that is quick
and simple to use with a ton of features
is aviary as soon as you choose a photo
it's down to business there's a quick
enhancement feature which lets you apply
automatic adjustments for sharpness
brightness or a color fix there are a
ton of filters to choose from as well
and more can be purchased from within
the app there are also frames and
stickers that come pre-loaded and there
are paid add-ons for more of those as
well it has the option to add text apply
a teeth whitening effect red-eye fix and
even a blemish fix it also has your
typical photo adjustments such as
shortness temperature saturation
contrast etc our favorite feature of
aviary is the meme creator best of all
aviary is free another application worth
mentioning is Pickler Express plus it
has almost the exact same features as
aviary and Snapseed simply with a
different interface and UX it's free as
well so it's definitely worth a download
now for the more serious photo editors
Photoshop Touch is by and large the most
in-depth photo editor on a mobile
platform it features essentially
everything mentioned in all of the
applications above and much much more
filters texts and all the usual
adjustments such as saturation contrast
brightness etc but it also has the
ability to replace a color reduce noise
at a fill or gradient warp or add
multiple layers to a single image and
has a smudge tool a clone tool and best
of all the scribble selection tool which
allows you to drop out the background of
an image with ease for any extensive
editing Photoshop Touch is definitely
the way to go however it's one of the
more expensive photo editors for iPhone
at $4.99 lastly iPhoto it lies somewhere
between Photoshop Touch and Snapseed the
app itself looks great and it packs a
ton of features we've already talked
about but unlike Snapseed it takes a lot
of getting used to and it has one of the
most confusing interfaces and user
experiences but once you learn it it's a
powerful tool for ending photos via
mobile
best part of this app is what it can do
with the photos after you finish editing
them you can create a journal and share
and sync it with iCloud iPhoto is also
$4.99 in the App Store and it's also
worth mentioning that it's a hundred and
fifty one megabytes versus the 20 to 30
megabytes of the other applications
