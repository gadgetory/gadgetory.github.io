have the thick bezels that most of us
expected the Garris for will reportedly
bring different changes in addition to a
different name and oh yes that red one
plus 6 is available right now and we are
loving it I'm hey metal Yvette and thank
you so much for all your feedback on all
the change in graphics and everything
it's funny when we don't change things
people complain and then when we change
things people do so glad you liked it
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with that red one plus
6 this one yes and my advice to you get
the carbon fiber case and this looks
really cool 579 right now it's now
available and for those of you that have
been trying to get the Bullitt wireless
headphones they are back in stock I
don't know it's just funny this is a one
plus 6 just like every other I don't
know if it's a software update sir now I
will have a video soon a comparison that
you guys want to watch and there are a
ton of cool things about this phone now
let's talk about Microsoft the company
has just surprised this with a teaser
video of the new Microsoft Surface go
one of the biggest questions that people
have poised lately is you know Windows
computers the best ones are extremely
expensive when are we gonna get
something that's more affordable the
surface go is pretty much a revamp of
the surface 3 for those of you that
remember meaning is extremely thin it's
light there will be an LTE option and it
starts at 399 depending on whatever
specs you want you can learn more in the
description I'm definitely looking
forward to that thing but we'll see
those of you that are wondering exactly
when we're getting new wearables from
Samsung which are definitely do well we
are expecting to see them at the
unpacked event and not a Tifa this year
apparently and we continue to hear less
about the whole Tizen approach and more
about that where OS variant that's going
to be called the Galaxy watch we've got
more trusted sources charming and we
hear more specifications you can see the
full list in the description so far I
just hope they bring more of that gear
frontier design now let's talk about
Apple there's a very interesting twist
in the way manufacturing is going to go
through when it comes to the iPhones and
an iPhone se
we've got sources claiming that
manufacturing is going to halt pretty
much at the entry of q3 for the company
to prepare for the manufacturing of all
the three new iPhones that are coming so
this means a ton of things first of all
that the iPhone 10 2018 is going to
probably look like the iPhone 10 but not
necessarily share most of the internals
or anything obviously there are changes
every year internally so yeah that could
be the case but also since the iPhone S
II is going to not be manufactured
anymore it seems that Apple definitely
wants to dilute that product into
whatever it's offering in its new
iPhones whatever the case may be we'll
see if that's the case as a yeah I mean
the company ran out of stock of iPhones
at the beginning and then it's been
loaded with stock after that so yeah and
finally the hottest news today have to
do if gonna stand out on aldo leaving my
al Maleh deal and I know you can see
that grim of him joining um throughs but
no that's not the hottest news iPhone 10
or iPhone 9 the LCD variant we hear that
it's not gonna have the bezels that we
expected rumours early on were that LCD
technology needed large vessels just to
be able to power the LCD now we hear
that that's not gonna be an issue and
we've seen it with cases like for
example the shall need be mix 2s and
others but apparently Apple has figured
out even better alternatives coming from
a company in Japan now we haven't been
able to confirm any of this
this comes from a trusted source though
so in today's question let us know what
do you think I mean our thicker or
thinner bezel is going to be an issue
for you to by the LCD iPhone because in
my case I I guess I don't really care so
long as the price tag doesn't sound
