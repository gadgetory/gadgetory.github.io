high mad but dreamer and votes a lot of
similarities there this guy is a
hilfiger commercial and what do you want
me to do I like the guy shirts bomb was
out of him female a male see that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
Mary there this is pocket now and this
is the pocket now daily recap for last
week so on Monday I asked you how much
extra will you pay for a sapphire
display that we're optional as we had
some leaked video showing us the iphone
6 so far display being tortured and we
have 169 comments out of which minute
tough says having a sapphire screen
shouldn't be an optional purchase it
should come with every iPhone and no
expert cost because of the prices that
Apple is already charging for their
phones and even though the entry level
16 gig bones are pretty much the same
price as the rest that a hundred-dollar
step for the 32 gig and 64 gig models is
definitely a reason for something to be
free I do agree with the more expensive
models then then read says it costs
about a hundred dollars to get your
screen fix that most independent repair
shops so to pay hundred dollars up front
is not a bad idea plus you may drop your
phone multiple times and the biggest
problem with these repair shops is
number one they don't always give you
genuine parts and number two they don't
always do a good job so for me to
sacrifice having a phone that will be
crippled eventually I would rather pay
extra but one hundred dollars is a
little steep for me then Joelle are says
shut up and take my money and I don't
build sapphire displays but hey I'll
take your money anytime dude then on
Tuesday ask you what Android wear
product that you choose as Android wear
products were already shipping and it
turns out that a lot of people were
complaining about the gear lie that is
charging cradle and we have 300 comments
out of which and honest 34 says moto 360
can't be beat in my opinion and I do
agree I am waiting for the Moto 360 and
that's my particular case that another
commoner says none smartwatches are
useless to be honest then you have a
very interesting point there
smartwatches are no longer in the
gimmick phase but the problem is they
are nothing without a smartphone meaning
there's really no point for you to buy a
SmartWatch unless you have a smartphone
and then again there is no added value
aside from saving you a couple of steps
and pulling your smartphone
from your pocket android word does a
good job but there is still more to be
done and that's really where the
opportunity is left for Microsoft and
Apple then another commoner says I'm
waiting for the iWatch and a lot of
people are but again it will depend on
how Apple is planning to innovate here
then on Wednesday famous tipster at
leagues left us this very cool puzzle
where he got some interesting
information on the Galaxy Note 4 it's
got a 64 bit XO see but a cipher glad he
was also asking us if the galaxy note 3
is 2 h and the galaxy note 4 is the TR
what does that mean and well we have 355
comments out of which euromaster says h
humongous TR tremendous next then hassan
ali says h-horrible TR terrible just
kidding I don't know and lord have mercy
then kunal says the differences note 3
is H LTE and note forest call TR LTE and
yes thank you somebody got it right
thank you very much other commenters
agree with this and that's most probably
the case then on Thursday I asked you
what do you think about Microsoft's
recent changes as Satya Nadella had just
addressed his employees and he has said
that they were going to shift the
company from a product and services
company that Steve Ballmer left into a
productivity and platform company we
have 234 comments out of which Carly
Johnson says xbox sux windows 8 sucks
windows phone sucks they should just
focus on software again because they are
failing at everything and I don't agree
with everything that you say because the
Xbox does not suck and Windows Phone
does not suck windows 8 could improve
and that's really the case a lot of
these products like Windows Phone could
improve but it doesn't necessarily mean
they suck they could improve in the way
they approach developers they could
improve it the way they approach the
market but not necessarily that these
products are bad because they really are
not but then again Microsoft does have a
lot of room for improvement and that's
really the problem it seems that they
don't really understand consumers so it
could be a good thing for them to focus
on enterprise that they want but that's
not really where the money is as we see
competition dealing the Restless says I
think medela is right they should not
copy Apple and you know what Microsoft
is such a big company and they've
invested so much in products like the
surface and the xbox and no
yeah that you know I think that
Microsoft could be doing both things and
do great if they would separate both
businesses they don't necessarily have
to just focus on enterprise Microsoft
has built some really cool products and
the fact that they just acquired nokia
means that they have a lot of the mobile
innovations so i really wouldn't want
them to move away from building consumer
products because of nokia specifically
but pay then trying to says to focus on
enterprise have you seen windows 8 no
business would be caught dead using it
and again we made that comment earlier
the problem with windows 8 is really
that it tries to solve a lot of the
problems that a lot of people don't have
and it's not visually appealing to many
people I like it it's just that I don't
know a lot of people don't and I guess
that's really the biggest problem that a
lot of people don't and these are the
people that are going to buy it and then
finally on Friday I asked you if you
were waiting for the iWatch or if you
were getting an android wear product as
the rumors are that apple will be
delayed with the iWatch until end of
this year probably next year we have 340
comments out of which adrian says pebble
all the way moto 360 is sexy but it all
depends on the battery life and
interesting out of all the comments this
was the only one that mentioned the
pebble I have the pebble and I wish them
luck I want the pebble steel but the
problem is Android wear looks a lot
better I mean I'm not saying that the
pebble is not a good product than if you
have an iPhone than pebbles the only way
to go right now but still the biggest
deal is that if pebble would build an
Android wear watch they would have a
business and hopefully that's what
they're gonna do and yes the Moto 360 is
awesome when Captain ashra says I don't
even understand the question if someone
is waiting for the iWatch they would
probably have an iphone meaning the
Android wear platform wouldn't be an
option not necessarily surely right now
Android wear is specific to Android
devices but Google now is not specific
to Android devices it's also available
on the iPhone and then again on the
opposite side there are a lot of people
that are shifting towards Android and
that's one of the biggest questions that
a lot of people have right now would
Android wear make you shift to Android
if you're coming from an iphone and it
could be the case but again time will
tell us the iWatch gets announces a lot
of people are waiting
and then a lot of people are due for
replacement on their phones by the end
of this year which will also make this
change interesting then another commoner
says I watch early next year now they
have to push it for the holidays or else
it's irrelevant and no that's not really
the case if Android wear would be a hit
then yes if the pebble would be a hit or
the samsung gear watches would be a hit
then yes but they are selling very badly
right now below the million units so
Apple does have so much opportunity here
but if they follow the same trend and do
the same thing that these guys are doing
then no they don't stand a chance but if
Apple can figure out a way to innovate
in ways that these guys haven't then yes
they do have an opportunity so no i
sadly don't agree with that thats it for
our parking out daily recap thank you
