pocketnow.com the htc inspire 4G can do
4G data speeds on AT&amp;amp;T so what sort of
speeds can you expect in practice we've
got the answer in this video let's get
to it so there's something strange going
on about the inspire 4G let's talk about
unlock the screen here and things look a
little bit different than the last video
because we're running launcherpro
instead of HTC Sense anyway that doesn't
matter so if you remember in the
unboxing we took the phone out and we
ran a speedtest immediately and we were
surprised to see that the results were
bad the speeds were slow they were about
one megabit per second down now on their
website ATT says that their hspa+
network should be doing six megabits per
second down remember that in practice
ats 3g network will give you a 2 to 3
megabits per second down so we're
talking about a two to three times
increase in speed which is great you
know that's that's a really fast data
speed 6 megabits per second down so we
ran the benchmark we got a slow speed
despite seeing the h plus here at the
top of the screen implying that we're on
hspa+ and then also in the unboxing we
went to about phone and to network and
under network type it said hsdpa which
is the older 3g standard that AT&amp;amp;T uses
right now it says UMTS for some reason
but when you're on an hspa+ network if
you're truly on one it will reflect that
here in the mobile network type so why
why is it not reflecting that we're on
hspa+ if there's an indicator well
obviously the indicator is lying okay
let's run a test and we'll explain what
we're talking about here I know we're
kind of being roundabout so here we are
we are going to run the speed test and
let's see what we get we're going to do
this a couple of times okay there we go
we're going to probably be at around 1.2
megabits per second down and according
to the phone we have full bars and we're
on hspa+ now that's pretty good 1.8 it's
still not even close to the advertised
six megabits per second down hey you
know let's bring over the nexus one
a tease 3g network and you know if you
look at the indicator work on 3g we have
full bars we're running on the same
server let's see how they compare this
is kind of interesting and confusing
okay so we've got a ping of 170
milliseconds hear a ping of nearly a
second over on the on the inspire 4G and
we're getting data speeds that are
almost two times faster on the 3g nexus
one this is wild and i don't really
understand it it's very confusing so
we're going to run the test again just
in case that was an anomaly now i should
mention that h wow that's a this is an
anomaly this is probably one of the
first times i got speed to this fast ATT
says that you're only going to get hspa+
speeds in areas of enhanced backhaul
which means they have to upgrade their
infrastructure to be able to support
these faster data speeds and if there
isn't the upgraded infrastructure in
your area you're going to fall back to
hsdpa but what's strange is that AT&amp;amp;T
does not advertise where they have their
enhanced back off so i'm not sure if
it's in my area or if i go you know 30
miles the last 30 miles to the north
there's really no way of knowing so
we're going to let these benchmarks run
a little bit more and again we're seeing
that overall the nexus one running on
the 3g network is getting faster data
speeds then the inspire 4G running on
the 4g network but obviously we know by
now it's not on the 4g network this is
bumped down to hsdpa and then the next
question is why is this device which
scores much faster in Quadrant getting a
lower score than the nexus one anyway
this isn't just an isolated occurrence I
ran a lot of tests and as you can see
anywhere you see this little icon that
means it's a cellular test so we've got
1 point 3 2 point 0 was a pretty good
run 1.1 this was an anomaly
four-point-oh and I say it's an anomaly
because we've got 59 up oh let's see 1.9
one point five six hundred four hundred
that was over Wi-Fi don't look at that
and so on and so forth so we're
averaging about 1.1 to 1.8 megabits per
second down on the inspire 4G over on
the nexus one we get to three point 0 a
lot so as you can see here's a three
point two point six kind of slow 1.4
there to point 1 2.3 very strange that
this is happening and by the way I've
run the speed test on multiple
applications that benchmark your
internet connection speed so it's not
just speedtest.net application so if we
bounce over here we can go to extreme
labs around the same speed test we're
going to get similar results so it's
understandable that 18d hasn't fully
rolled out its hspa+ network that
obviously takes some time but why are
they misleading the customer by showing
them an h+ at all times in the top part
of the notification area this should
drop down the 3g like right now because
i'm obviously over 18 th 3g network
getting 3g speeds of about 1.8 megabits
per second it's very misleading people
are going to buy this phone bring it
home they're going to get these slow
data speeds and wonder if there's
something wrong with their phone it's
just misleading we're going to try to
get a statement from AT&amp;amp;T about this
because this is just very confusing to
the average customer and and one more
area to and one more note we've talked
to other reviewers that have this phone
thinking that it may be an issue with
just this unit and they're experiencing
the same data speeds so this is an issue
really with this indicator at the end of
the day not being accurate and telling
the truth anyhow let us know what you
think about this situation it's kind of
a little bit frustrating for us because
we were expecting a 4g phone and we
don't know where to go to get 4G speeds
ATT doesn't make that no anyway please
leave a comment let us know what you
think and thanks for watching that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
