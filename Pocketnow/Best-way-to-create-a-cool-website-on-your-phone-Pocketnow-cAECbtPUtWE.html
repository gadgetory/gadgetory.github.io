conversation with my buddy David Cogan
over how important it is for his
creators to have assets of our own sure
our content lives in YouTube but the
biggest problem is we can't really
control its future the only thing you
can truly control is a website of your
own but building one is difficult if you
want to build a really good one you need
coding skills and if you want to build
one or control one while on mobile that
can be even more difficult
so because we review phones and tablets
we decided to embark on a little journey
to find a balanced solution particularly
when you're on the go and it turns out
that there actually is I'm going to be
better with pocket now and these are our
impressions of using Wix while on mobile
the process of building your own website
is actually fairly simple and the bit
part is that it'll look good on either
your desktop browser or your phone's
browser grab your phone go to wix.com
and create an account it's actually free
and I suggest you start that way as Wix
has solutions that are tailored for
different types of businesses if you're
into tech like we are a photographer or
makeup artist the approach of the
website varies and if you want to sell
your own merchandise there are solutions
you could pay for to help you out with
that in our case we don't sell anything
we don't take any bookings but we are
focused on gaining more subscribers
start by giving your website a name
choose if you want to provide your
location info which has got a tool to
search of your business is already
online and then you can add a logo
connect your social media and here's
where we get to the cool part if you
want your website to be taken seriously
it has to look professional
lucky for us we still haven't paid a
dime and there are already Styles you
can choose from to pimp it out I'm
liking this one called innovative given
the fonts and icons but you can pick
whichever option you want and switch it
later select it and the tool starts
creating your website the process of
building it is actually really quick
voila your website is ready to either
preview or publish it loads a couple of
example posts just to give you an idea
of what your website would look like
once you start loading your own content
on it then hit that edit button and
believe it or not you're gonna start
editing your website while on the go
here there are three sections pages
themes and more themes is
self-explanatory if you want to change
the look of the websites and more is for
going to features like your account in
case you want to upgrade to a premium
plan probably the most important section
is pages because this is where you
actually make your website look like
your own you can add new sections like
an about you page contact information
etc if you edit the home section which
was actually created automatically you
can change basics like your header
welcome screen blog etc you can also
update a post from here once you're
comfortable with what you see there is a
publish button at the top right and your
website is ready for primetime
so notice a few things number one I
created a website without spending a
dime number two I created it all on my
phone in just a few minutes number three
which is most important the result is a
professional and robust website from the
beginning number four you can start
building your own idea on mobile and
then continue adding features and
customizations on the desktop and there
are a ton of options to choose from now
for those of you asking when is it worth
to pay well you actually don't have to
but there are some limitations in the
free tier and in the beginning your
website is creative with whatever name
you chose under the Wix domain the best
way to get your brand exposed is if you
get your own domain which you can
actually purchase on Wix and then you
can choose whichever plan adapts to your
particular needs
my personal choice was for the unlimited
plan but there are other offers and
added extras of your business requires
booking administration if you want to
sell your own merchandise etc you choose
where to start what options suit your
needs best and you can choose to upgrade
over time as your product evolves what's
most important is that you have total
creative freedom and the system is so
technologically advanced that you can do
everything yourself
so far I have to say that I am very
impressed at how easy it was to get
started and how complete the platform is
my advice to you go on over to the
description hit the link go visit Wix
com give it a try whether you're
creating your own personal website it
doesn't really matter just get started
check it
