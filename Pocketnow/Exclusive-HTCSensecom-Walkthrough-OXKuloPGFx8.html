pocket now calm when HTC announced the
HTC Desire HD in the desire z which go
on sale in October they also announced
HTC Sense calm which is a full-fledged
online management tool of your android
phone and it works with the desire HD
and the desire z it has a lot of awesome
features and up until about today you
couldn't really access it unless you had
a desire HD or desire z well we don't
have either of those devices but we are
running the desire HD rom on the HTC hd2
so we can give you an early preview of
all of the awesome features that HTC
Sense has to offer let's take a look
okay starting off this is your dashboard
and by the way if you are running the
HTC hd2 and your you're running the
desire HD rom you can register on HTC
Sense com for free so starting off on
the dashboard we get a map which shows
us where in the world our phone is and
this is really awesome because let's say
you lose your phone you don't know where
it is it could be across the country it
just came from California and you're
traveling you can see where your phone
is with a lot of precision here on this
map i'm not going to zoom in all the way
but i can tell you that it's very
precise and telling you where your phone
is in the world over here on the right
you can choose to forward calls if you
want you can also forward messages and
you can even forward messages to an
email address so let's say you aren't
going to be your leave your phone at
home you're going to go into work and
you want all of your SMS to go to your
work email you can do that through this
online interface down here it says ring
so let's say you lose your phone maybe
in the couch cushion you don't know
where it is if you press ring within
about a second watch this it happens
really fast your phone rings really
loudly pretty cool down below ring you
have lock phone this is so that lets say
you lose your phone in the back of a
taxi cab and you want to put a message
on the screen that says hey I've lost my
phone please call this number so that I
can meet up with you to get my phone you
can actually do that from this interface
and you can also put in a four-digit pin
so that the person that's looking at the
message cannot get into your data and
finally you can erase the phone if all
hopes are lost and you don't think
you're ever going to get your phone back
you don't want people looking at your
information you can wipe your phone
clean from this button here it says
erase phone now up here at the top there
are several other buttons we can press
footprints will back up your HTC
footprints although it's very likely
that most people don't use footprints
unless you travel a lot so we're not
going to cover that over here people is
pretty cool so this backs up all of the
contacts on your HTC phone and most
people already have a way to back up
their context they may have microsoft
exchange or gmail or something else but
if you don't have a way to get back up
your contacts HTC's Sense calm gives you
a way to do that and what we
here is just one contact that I've added
and it's synchronized instantly with my
phone when I add a new one and you can
do this both ways so you can add a
contact from your phone or add a contact
from the web interface and everything is
kept synchronized it's quite quite
fantastic now over here in the messages
column this is where things get really
cool so you can actually carry on an SMS
conversation through the web interface
in other words when you type a message
to somebody it routes it through the
internet through your phone and then apt
to the other person's phone / gsm of
course so i can actually manage this
conversation and i can type a new
message and literally that message will
show up on my phone as if i typed it
from my phone but actually I tucked it
from the web interface so a really cool
way to manage conversations while you're
not necessarily using your phone which
is great because for example at work
your boss doesn't want to see you
playing with your phone they want to see
you staring at a computer screen in a
lot of cases so you can carry on text
message conversations without them
knowing that you are actually you know
doing that let's go over here to HTC hub
this is really cool so this allows you
to push a lot of different programs and
themes and ringtones to your phone
remotely so you can browse what HTC
likes from here and this is actually an
application that is on the desire HD
it's just a app recommendation platform
that shows you some really cool apps to
try on your android phone and we can
kind of dial down more specifically
let's say we want to change scenes of
course HTC devices has a variety of
scenes but here you can actually choose
from more scenes so they have one called
the avid reader which is pretty cool so
we can click on that and click send to
phone and watch what happens okay so i
just clicked send a phone and i can see
a download remotely started on my
computer or on my phone here it says
avid reader and that is an HTC seen it's
downloading pretty fast and with a few
within a few seconds i'll be able to
change my theme to that now there's a
lot more stuff you can do over here with
the HTC help we can go to apps and
plugins and let's say i want to send
this application called backgrounds to
my phone you can't really download it
remotely but what you can do is click
the mark button and
on your phone let me show you what
happens okay and within about two
seconds especially if you're over a
high-speed connection we get a new
notification that says nieuwmarkt apps
so you tap on that and it takes you into
the HTC hub application and it shows you
all of the applications that you have
marked so that later you can go and
download them so you can really shop for
applications on HTC hub com or HTC Sense
calm and be able to find all of those
apps that HTC recommends and this is the
hub application which is now active with
HTC Sense calm being online so I can
show you that for quick second before we
conclude this video and it's going a
little bit slowly right now because the
Wi-Fi is not working on this build so
here we have featured applications and
we can kind of flick through with our
finger and get the carousel here we've
got starred items most popular to the
right of that unable to connect that's
not good friends comments over here is
my download so this will synchronize
with what you download here from the HTC
hub on HTC Sense calm and finally like
we talked about over here we have the
marked items so you know which items to
go back and download later so HTC help
calm is a really fantastic interface for
people that want to have full remote
management of their phone something that
we really have yet to see we've seen it
in parts through for example Microsoft
my phone on windows mobile devices but
HTC Sense chrome is really a full
experience of a remote phone management
which a lot of people are really going
to enjoy if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and visit pocket now
calm for the latest in smartphone news
and reviews that's it for now and thanks
