likely to bowl anyone over after all
carrier subsidies routinely bring the
retail price at least that low for some
of the fanciest devices you can find but
when you break or lose that phone and
need to replace it on the cheap or when
you tally up the total of all those
monthly installments it's true cost
becomes clear is it possible then to buy
a smartphone that costs only 2 or $300
off contract while also bringing the
experience of a much more expensive
flagship a soos gave it a go let's see
if it succeeded I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the azuz zenfone 2 for all its
potential to redefine the affordable
smartphone segment the zenfone 2 makes a
pretty low-key first impression with a
5.5 inch full HD display it's a big
phone and with 170 gram mass and nearly
11 millimeter thickness it's pretty
hefty to the features that could make it
stand out or minimized or watered-down
the cool rear mounted volume key for
instance is also shrunken and subdued
compared to competitors the capacitive
buttons below the screen don't light up
which is weird and the power button is
positioned way up top where it's tough
to get at fortunately you can double tap
the Gorilla Glass 3 over the IPS display
to wake it up but don't expect to be
blown away by the brightness while it's
plenty colorful it's also quite a dim
panel and even moderate daylight and
viewing angles are nothing to scream
about either it's only when you look
beneath the surface that things start
getting exciting the budget model
zenfone 2 takes its power from a 1.8
gigahertz Intel Atom processor backed up
by 2 gigs of RAM while the higher-end
trim packs in a 2.3 gigahertz processor
augmented by a whopping 4 gigs of ram
tossin dual SIM card support microSD
expansion and an embedded 3000 milliamp
hour battery and you've got a smart
phone that means serious business and if
you want everyone to know that it's much
more badass than its drab grey cover
implies a sues also sells an array of
colorful back covers to customize the
look and feel
the customizability doesn't stop there
if 2015 is the year of user tailored
software the zenfone 2 fits right in
while the Zen UI launcher writes atop an
aging Android 5.0 foundation it redeems
itself with some of the deepest
interface management available out of
the box using a mixture of icon packs
wallpapers and themes you can upgrade
the Zen phones cartoony stock interface
very easily my favorite combination over
a week of testing has been the
silhouette icon pack over the travel
theme with card flip animations but
there are literally thousands of other
combinations you could choose a soos has
also included lots of little
conveniences swiping down from anywhere
on the home screen triggers the
notification shade for example and
double tapping the status bar or a blank
portion of the wallpaper turns the
screen off and when the phone is locked
you can jump right into specific apps by
tracing a letter on the screen if you've
got younglings there's a dedicated kids
mode complete with app siloing and a
timer that shuts down access after a
predefined period we've seen all this
stuff before on other phones but it's
nice to have it all gathered together
under one roof the zenfone 2 also packs
an awful lot of bloat for an unlocked
device probably the most visible our
system utilities clean master and doctor
safety now each title does enjoy a very
high rating on the Google Play Store and
clean master is actually quite
therapeutic I loved hitting the boost
button and watching it clear up vast
swathes of RAM and seconds by closing
background processes but for years it's
been debated whether apps like this are
anything more than a placebo for
smartphone micromanagers and while I do
enjoy the sense that clean master is
boosting my system performance it's not
at all clear that it actually does as
for all the other cruft a soos Pak sin
it runs the gamut from uninvited
preloads like omelette chat and Zinio to
various PC remote control and cloud
storage apps fortunately you can
manually uninstall the worst of it if a
budget phone makes a compromise more
often than not you find it in the camera
but the zenfone 2 mostly avoids that
trap I say mostly because there are
definite compromises here there's no
optical stay
insite the double-click volume key
shortcut doesn't always work and the
viewfinder software is like something
out of 2012 with its 17 separate
shooting modes but start snapping
pictures and the results might surprise
you with space to spare on our 64 gig
review unit I cranked up the resolution
to the full 13 megapixels and what I
found was a camera that did really well
in broad daylight with sharp detail
crazy colors and fast enough shutter
speed to take the blur all the way out
of a passing commuter rail train whether
the supersaturation will impress you or
put you off will depend on how much you
value authenticity in your photography
these are definitely more colorful
reproductions than the real world
subjects they represent and the cartoony
effect gets much more pronounced in HDR
mode but given the choice between too
much color and not enough well call me
basic or whatever but I'll take the
former any day a soos tosses in a neat
trick here with its so-called super
resolution mode which combines four
photos to produce one giant 50 megapixel
image this takes a longer exposure time
but it also works pretty well comparing
a super resolution shot to a standard 13
megapixel photo of the same scene the
super photo features more detail and
less noise and the night mode does
indeed bring more light into the frame
using digital stabilization though
you'll want to be sure you're truly in
the dark before you use it and you need
to be okay with a much lower resolution
photo as well does the zenfone 2 have
the best smartphone camera ever not at
all there's an awful lot of artificial
sharpening in almost every image
low-light photos have a lot of digital
noise and HD video suffers from shaky
cam and exposure problems even in ideal
conditions but this camera like every
other aspect of the zenfone 2 needs to
be considered through the lens of its
price it is quite possibly the best
camera on an affordably priced
smartphone
an Intel chipset on an Android phone is
a relative rarity these days so I wasn't
sure what to expect from the zenfone 2 4
mints
turns out I had nothing to worry about
this n phone 2 runs like a dream stutter
and lag is so rare as to be almost
non-existent graphically loaded games
run without a hitch and here's the
kicker swapping back and forth between
them is just as effortless again this is
the higher end spec loaded model but if
the entry level version performs even
half as well as this it'll be worth the
cost the zenfone 2 lives up to the phone
portion of its name calls are reasonably
clear and loud through the earpiece
unfortunately conference calls and media
playback are no picnic at all despite
that big back mounted grill the
loudspeaker itself is tiny and tinny
even plugging in a set of earbuds didn't
help with the latter no matter what
software profile I used when playing
music or podcasts sound was just too
quiet
and too thin and audio files dreams this
phone is not finally in endurance the
zenfone 2 is about average there's
certainly potential for it to be a road
warrior with a big 3000 milliamp hour
battery quick charging capability ultra
power saving mode and other
optimizations but the combined drain of
whatever leaks there are in lollipop and
my usual bevy of social media apps means
I can't get much past four hours of
screen on time per charge I can usually
get through a full 12 hour day of
moderate use which is fine the zenfone 2
isn't the only affordable smartphone
with compelling specs leading a soos to
the punch this year and last were
oneplus Motorola Nokia and Alcatel
OneTouch among others but of all those
the zenfone 2 is easily the most
audacious this $2.99 model packs
responsiveness customizability and tons
of features into an absurdly potent
Hardware package and it throws in a
pretty good camera to boot it's not a
true grand slam but for a power-hungry
pragmatist on a budget the zenfone 2 is
pretty much impossible to beat
