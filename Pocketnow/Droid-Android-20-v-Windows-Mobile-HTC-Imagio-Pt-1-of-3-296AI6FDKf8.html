hi everyone this is chun win and today
we're going to take a look at the user
interface voice command and multimedia
features and compare that between the
android 2.2 mon the motorola droid with
windows mobile 6.5 and touchflo 3d on
the HTC imagio also on verizon wireless
in a second video segment we're going to
explore email and calendar and a third
video the final video we're going to
look at the settings programs menu and
the marketplace and how that differs so
let's go ahead and take a look let's go
back to the lock screen actually at the
main lock screen at the bottom here you
have the day date and time you also have
a notifications here if you do have
notifications such as emails missed call
or voicemail you can tap on the lock
here and it will pop down to show you
how many and which notifications you
have currently we have no notification
so it's not going to show anything you
can slide left or right on the main lock
screen to go to the main home screen or
if you have notifications they should
have individual lock icons themselves so
you can swipe those to go directly into
the application such as if you have a
missed call it will launch the call
application here we're at the main home
screen which gives you a touch flo 3d
experience which offers you also
different tabs that gives you a widget
like experience so you don't have to
individually launch applications such as
the weather or the calendar application
it will give you a quick view so here's
the calendar if you tap on the day it
will give you a schedule of what your
appointments are so this is our October
calendar we're going to go ahead and
exit out of that and go here to the
weather and it does pull in using your
gps location the weather and this is the
weather for los angeles for los angeles
and it gives you a five-day view so
that's a quick look at the user
interface here the user interface
unfortunately falls a little short and
isn't always as touch friendly as you
see so let's go ahead and dive deeper
and once you dive deeper you'll see what
I'm talking about and we're going to go
through the personal settings and when
we go into phone here we're reverted
back to a windows mobile
56.1 like experience here and you see
individual tabs here at the bottom and
arrows which are not to finger friendly
and so that's a little bit of a of a
disadvantage with windows mobile 6.5 is
that it doesn't completely skin all the
individual applications to bring it up
to date to a consistent you I feel you
also have voice command on here which
you can access by pressing and holding
the send button here so let's go ahead
and do that open windows media player
you can tell it to open applications
play songs by music or genre you can
tell it to say call and your contact
name or dial a number and you can also
ask it for command such as what is the
time but it doesn't allow you to search
or navigate through programs such as the
GPS in multimedia we're going to go
ahead and take a look at the HTC
implementation of multimedia on touchflo
3d here on the screen you can flick
through different pictures that you may
have or if you hit on album it will take
you into an album like view which shows
you pictures in a grid like view and
we're going to go ahead and tap it again
to select what we want to look at we're
going to choose the storage card and if
you tap on a picture it will launch in
landscape mode and you can swipe left
and right to change the picture and here
we have a play button so that is a movie
let's go ahead and play it I have Lord
of the Rings set up here
if you tap on the screen it will give
you an on-screen control let's go ahead
and fast-forward through it a little bit
the movie seems like it starts out to
populate it into a full screen mode
which takes up the screen but we know
this isn't a 16 by 9 screen so let's go
ahead and shrink it back you do have the
option of watching it in widescreen here
which is what it was encoded for and if
you don't like the black bars at the top
and bottom you can actually open it up
so you can have a full screen view and
fill out the screen that way as well go
ahead and stop the movie and this has
been a quick tour the user interface
voice command and multimedia features on
the imagio running windows mobile 6.5
let's go ahead and do the same for the
android 2.2 here we have the main unlock
screen which shows you you can set a
instead of a password you can actually
set a a pattern to unlock it that only
you would know so if you enter the
pattern it will unlock it at the top
here you have the notification bar you
can't access notifications directly like
you can with windows mobile 6.5 on the
unlock screen but after you unlock it
you can swipe down here and it will show
you that you have a new notification and
tapping on that opens up the email
application which we will cover in
another video but you can scroll through
your emails that way here is the home
screen you do have three panels which
you can add widgets or shortcuts to hear
we have a widget to the financial stock
market we can go ahead and add another
widget by tapping and holding and
choosing widget on the pop-up and we're
going to add an analog clock to remove a
widget just tap and hold and drag it
down to the trash it will glow red and
let go and you widget is gone programs
are accessed by either tapping on the
arrow here at the bottom which will pull
up a grid view of all your programs or
if you want you can swipe up slowly to
get a peek and swipe it down
android also comes with voice command
it's a more ubiquitous voice command and
is a combination of tell me which is a
Microsoft subsidiary and also Microsoft
voice command so you can tap and hold on
the microphone here and you can tell it
to search for different things and it
can search for your phone and then pulls
up the search also on the internet as
well you can tell it to call a person
let's go ahead and tell it to search
search for starbucks starbucks and then
it should pull up the results in a
browser interface here and you can
scroll through the results you can also
tell it to navigate to a certain
location as well so we're going to go
ahead and tell it to navigate to the
Getty Villa navigate to get Eve illa and
it will pull up google maps with
navigation which offers turn-by-turn
voice guidance gps navigation which is
nice I'm go ahead and select this as a
result exit navigation here and go to
the home screen at the home screen if
you tap and hold on home you have a task
menu which brings up these six most
recent applications that you open let's
go ahead and open up gallery so that we
can see some of the multimedia features
so here's our gallery you can open up a
picture unfortunately you can swipe but
if you tap on a picture you can go ahead
and scroll through to the next picture
and here we're at the movie which is
another I don't know if it's the same
Lord of the Rings clip but if you tap on
it and tap play go ahead and resume
playing good and fast forward if you tap
on it it will give you additional
on-screen commands unfortunately this
isn't coded to the proper screen
resolution so you do see black bars at
the top and the bottom but you don't
have the option to expand it to fill the
screen which is rather unfortunate for
those who want to watch the thing the
movie using their full screen and not be
bothered with the black bars so this has
been a quick look at android 2.0 using
we have taken a look at the user
interface voice command and multimedia
and have compared those basic features
to windows mobile 6.5 thanks for
