the improvements are not just minor
google seems to be just a week away from
supporting wearables in the android sdk
we get the first links of the Oppo find
7 i'm high memory that and what do you
do when you get home because i get a
haircut this is out daily let's
first lay off with some official news as
that was just released iOS 7.1 to the
public and even though the changes are
minor for some these are rather
significant for a lot of people using
the iphone 5s for example the iOS 7 was
probably one of the buggiest releases of
iOS and history and ever pretty much
nailed a lot of the changes here i'm
getting better battery life there's more
sensitivity in touch ID Syria is a lot
more reliable and you do get some
improvements like car play for example
which will not be released until later
whenever you buy a car that now supports
that put again the features are there
the update is their links to the super
in for the full list of updates and yeah
get your update now before the server
gets crashed now let's talk about Google
as the company has made it official that
they will be launching an SDK that
supports wearables as we've seen sony
try with wearables and samsung as well
the fact that samsung actually moved
away from android with their new gear
lineup is sort of a saying that hey
google we actually needed something that
would support wearables and had more
standards and as a matter of fact Boogle
is doing that the company will probably
be launching this within the next two
weeks and then it will have to wait for
developers and ODMs to actually take
advantage of it but it's great to see
that there is work in progress in that
direction speaking of Google sundar
Pichai was just at south by southwest in
an event and he confirmed that there
will be more support for other countries
with a chromecast for $39 it's just
incredible when you can do with this
device and the company keeps adding more
features and more users to it and we
also have the SDK so hopefully we will
be seeing other countries actually
selling this product and again it's a
work in progress and for the amount of
money it's just crazy to see that you
can do so much with it now talk about LG
as we get new rumors of the LG g3
apparently this phone will now support
water and dustproof technology just like
we have the galaxy s5 and almost every
Sony Xperia in the market it's really
great to see that LG is bringing this
technology to the market as a matter of
fact every cell phone should be this way
given the fact that we actually use our
cell phones just about everywhere
including when it's raining so again we
still don't know if this is going to
happen these are just rumors but given
the fact that the galaxy s5 includes it
and we know how LG operates this is most
likely going to happen and finally for
the more mixed news of the day we get
the first leaked images of the Oppo find
7 the smartphone that a lot of us have
been waiting for not necessarily because
it's made by one of the most popular
OEMs but because this is pretty much
gonna be the only smartphone that
actually pushes technology forward when
it comes to specification this one is
apparently going to be powering the
first to pay display on smartphones in
the market sacr√© mother goodies and we
were expecting a 50 megapixel camera
here but that's actually the odd and
mixed part about this news apparently
the 50 megapixel camera will not be
included just a 13 megapixel camera and
we're just hoping that these leaks are
of a some other phone or probably a
variant of the Oppo find 7 but that
leads me to the question of the day
after everything you've seen from Oppo
in these past couple of years is this
phone something you're looking forward
to because in my particular case it is
if they do include the 15 megapixel
camera 2k this place are not really that
big for me yet but leave us a comment
