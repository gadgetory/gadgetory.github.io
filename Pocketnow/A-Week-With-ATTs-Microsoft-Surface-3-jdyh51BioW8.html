and if you're looking for a very good
back-to-school tablet that can also
replace your laptop it's time to have a
second look at the Microsoft Surface
three sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T we don't blame
you if you still confuse the name
surface with the first two tablets that
Microsoft launched years ago which again
were just tablets the past changed
dramatically with the Microsoft Surface
3 up to the point where almost a year
later we are still recommending it as a
student or average consumer you can't
always afford to buy a tablet and a
computer and sometimes computers are too
bulky or tablets are too underpowered
now the Microsoft Surface 3 has a few
things that make it very unique first of
all it's made of a very sturdy and light
magnesium alloy that looks extremely
elegant thanks to its ceramic finish it
sports a full computer processor with an
Intel Atom x7 with options for 2 or 4
gigs of RAM depending on the choice of
either 64 or 128 gigs of storage along
with an Intel gen8 GPU what this means
is that it runs a full version of
Windows 10 and yes that also means it
runs a full version of Microsoft Office
and the surface 3 even includes a year
of Microsoft Office 365 the big matters
better you won't really have to be
fumbling with adapters we've got high
speed USB support a mini DisplayPort for
your monitor and even microSD expansion
it uses a standard micro USB connector
for charging meaning you can actually
use a regular battery pack after your 10
hours of battery or over something you
can't really do with every PC if you
want to be fully connected no problem it
connects the AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE network if you
want to scan a document on the go
there's an 8 megapixel camera at the
back along with a 3 megapixel camera at
the front for video calls now what I've
loved the most about the surface 3 after
a week of using it as my daily driver is
the fact that it can not only replace
your laptop it even does a really good
job at replacing a standard notebook
I mean the paper notebooks actually it
starts with the fact that we have a
gorgeous 10 inch display with high
resolution in nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty so things look like printed paper
the surface includes a built-in
kickstand to prop it over a table or
your lamp you don't really have to be
depending on cases and there's also a
very neat type cover that protects the
surface while you commute and then
becomes a full backlit keyboard with a
trackpad type all your notes with
Microsoft OneNote and you can later
highlight these or write on them with
the optional Microsoft Surface pen
pretty much like if you're using printed
paper the kickstand even has other
positions to enhance writing over it
even cooler writing your notes extends
to other applications from the Microsoft
Office suite you can even write on the
Microsoft edge browser and then if you
want to make this the full desktop
experience then sure you can also use
the optional Microsoft docking station
the Microsoft Store that enhances the
experience with even more applications
and since you're running a full version
of Windows you can install others like
you would on a regular PC and then after
school or work is done you've got great
fun firing dual stereo speakers with
Dolby audio and tons of media options to
choose from in addition to a lot of
great Xbox games if you're in the market
for a back-to-school tool that's also a
very portable tablet I can replace your
laptop and that can also replace a
standard paper notebook it really
doesn't get better than this right now
and through November 3rd AT&amp;amp;T is
offering customers an eligible Microsoft
Surface 3 type cover keyboard with the
purchase of a Microsoft Surface 3 on a
qualified data plan items must be
purchased together you can check out the
link below and be sure to review the
restrictions and fees that apply now
even when back-to-school doesn't really
apply to me this Microsoft Surface 3 has
become my favorite tool lately instead
of carrying a bulky computer I can
handle a ton of essentials here with a
lot less weight actually all the
scripting that we've done for our videos
over the last week has been done
entirely on the surface 3
and I'm not really going back and you
know what I highly suggest you give it a
try as well folks just like this we've
