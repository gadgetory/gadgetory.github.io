make it like a Beetlejuice situation but
Google is putting a stop to that that
isn't keeping the match phones from
being hot sellers however and the
numbers point to one particular
manufacturer as the king of the
polarizing feature there are plenty of
phones that we have yet to see in 2018
so we're really excited to see them but
a couple of them we will cover today
before we get on our respective planes
and head to New York for Samsung's next
unpacked event so look forward to that
listeners and viewers speaking of events
one did just happen however and now we
have a brand new moto phone the force
may not be strong with this one but one
of the key mods will bring the next
generation of mobile Internet hello
everybody and welcome to the weekly buy
pod pocket now and xda-developers on
this day the 3rd of august 2018 from
smartphones to tablets to wearables and
so much more welcome and let's get
started talking about all the stuff you
dreamed of having when you were a kid
I'm your host for the weekly Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody I'm so
excited to be here and thank you so much
not only to the fellows for having me as
the hosts but also to all of you
listening and perhaps watching here on
the livestream is because of you I
missed you all that I'm back on the
podcasting mic joining us in the
production booth is Jules Wong who did a
wonderful job of hosting the show before
a wild JV appeared so Jules I just
wanted to give a quick shout out to you
how are things going on here anybody
what type are your second tape or a
water-type what would you be I want to
say ground-type because I'm all about
drinking teas and teas from the ground
that's my first thing well anyways hello
welcome to you all and go Cubs
unfortunately they lost last night but
this was included in the in the Moto mod
cover or I think it's still called a
style cover it did look like a good time
right like it looked like an awesome
time out there yeah we spent way too
much time at bars should be especially
near especially near the Cubs stadium
right if you want to get into what we
did with Michael Fisher for art and a
whole bunch of other people but the
michael fisher bid i'll save for the
second segment here all right sounds
good we also have pocket now's brandon
minimun as part of our panel how's it
going brother
yo hey Josh I've always wondered what is
the origin of this ah well if you okay
so I'm kind of a I didn't used to like
being called by my initials and then
when I was playing around with a few
like new symbols and whatnot because if
you remember from the last place that I
used to work I used to do this kind of
whole thing I used to salute and all
that I face that out after a while
because I was starting to get people
still looking at me all the time a
little bit weird but I wanted to have a
thing and I like you know I do a few
signs of one and then I realized J
that's so interesting I see it now
there's a fingers that's exactly so I I
talked to one of my friends who I study
martial arts with and he's a graphic
designer and I was like what do you
think of this if I if I open up my own
channel and he's like I can make that
icon for you like that
and I was like sweet yeah so that's what
uh that's how that whole thing came
about it's awesome yeah speaking of
which I did want to thank you for
reminding me actually Brendan um thank
you so much for watching the
announcement video and also thanks to
these guys for letting me have some fun
with it
I had this song in mind that I always
wanted to use even though it's it's
admittedly a copyrighted song but you
know I got I got I got approval to use
it from these guys and just a few
comments that were on there um just to
set the record straight I am the host of
the podcast moving forward I am going to
do the odd video from time to time but
to the couple of people who are
wondering what's going on with me on my
own end I'm still continuing my work on
my channel and everything like that it
just so happens that I'm allowed to not
only allow to but I'm very happy to
collaborate with these guys and that's
gonna be a great ours is gonna be a
wonderful relationship moving forward
and isn't speaking of the relationship I
think there's one person that you would
like to introduce and that's right
speaking of that we have the man at the
helm of the daily and pocket mal espa√±ol
I'm a romera hello hello I was I was
just thinking right now if I had to use
my initials and and try to make you know
my yeah
total gang member man that's another
thing I had to be absolutely certain
that this didn't mean something bad
somewhere and I did so much research to
make sure as it turns out somewhere in I
think like mid Eastern Europe I forget
which countries in particular this is a
this is their peace symbol so so it's
like the you know two finger but with
the thumb out I
I would have to do the ring finger out
but because the tendons between the
Pinky and the ring finger are you can't
do the whole more thing so yeah there's
like a V and then I W is just another V
attached away but if you if you go for
jewels I will totally I will totally
support you what are your skills man
what are your freakin talents just you
know whatever you want to say hi it's
just wave all your initials are here
Jules there you go live long and prosper
everybody speaking of shout outs to
Fisher anyway okay so we're gonna go
ahead and get into the news all right so
we have a bunch of stories this week and
the first few of them actually have to
do with knotch
devices and number one though on the
list is the fact that Google is saying
hold up let's not go too crazy with
these notches let's let's put a few
regulations on this before it gets too
far
so only one notch per edge only two
total per device which kind of begs the
question what the heck would a three
knotch device even look like what would
that even before now a couple pieces of
info before we get into everybody's
thoughts what the what Google is trying
to say here is that mob cheese can only
be found on the short edge of the device
so if you're looking at let's say a
1080p frame it would be on the short
1080p side not on the 1920 side so
you're not going to see it on the long
sides on the right or the left of any
phone when you're looking at it in
portrait mode and you're not going to
see more than two on any given device so
that whole Beetlejuice situation not
happening moving forward so here's the
so I do want to pose the question to the
rest of you guys what could you even
imagine
three notch device and why I can't even
imagine a tattoo knotch device like well
what would that look like to you I may
like do you think a two notch device
where ones on the bottom half or bottom
edge would make sense again I I have
everything against bezels so it doesn't
matter if I get a chin at the bottom or
whatever whatever companies do to get
rid of them for me is fine so it would
make sense to me if we had dual speakers
like two notches that are symmetrical
and that these are speakers that from me
would be cool but that would be it like
no more than this please trying to think
of what other bits and pieces like could
there be a notch on the bottom that
maybe has like a fingerprint reader on
it maybe that's the way that they leave
it on the front you know is the question
well I mean I do have a reference point
here and that's a ZT I think we covered
this ZTE had a design award for a
conceptual phone that was like it had
glass that came off of the phone because
they hadn't rounded corners so it came
off over the phone and formed its own
corners then the glass met from the Frye
in the back but it had two notches and
there was all our presumption since
there was it was just the design we
didn't really know what was going on
with that one
so ZTE has experimented with that and
then there's also what we'll get to at
the very end of the show I'm not going
to spoil it but it is quite the thing to
look at yeah that's all I'm going to say
any thoughts on Aaron Brendan like
you're working right now with the most
bottom notches phone ever the key to so
[Laughter]
you know what I think would actually be
okay with me last time we were talking
about potential Huawei phone with an
island notch for the camera for a cutout
for the camera like I don't I think
would be that bad to go with high Mae's
dual dual speaker idea to have two
little lines that are basically cutouts
in the display for speakers to come
through that's so much better than
having to utilize like such a large area
to surround the speaker's you could just
do a little island
on the top and the bottom hmm oh oh
that's gonna happen a lot on the podcast
I'm sure I'm just looking forward to
when a to notch device finally comes out
if someone has the let's say the the
stones to do it and because the reason
why I'm looking forward to is because I
can't wait to see all the Twitter hate I
can't wait to see all the reviewers who
are like why and I might be one of them
personally but my one requirement for a
to notch device in my opinion would be
that like we've talked about with the 1
+ 6 that the content doesn't wrap around
it yes all they care about ya know for
me for me I guess the biggest problem
like I don't like the Huawei approach we
have this like huge chin at the bottom
on the beats when he broke and you know
they they make it they give it a purpose
with the fingerprint scanner but it did
that for me looks I don't know I I it
looks weird and I'm also concerned about
the pixel 3 Excel leaks but where it's
like this huge notch at the at the top
and and then you also have like the the
chin at the bottom for the speaker but
then it just doesn't look symmetrical
like what is shorter than the other it
looks weird to me I don't know what you
think so 3 does look weird I agree yeah
change and I'm assuming yeah now we are
going to move over to another to a
huawei device as we move from talking
about the general notch development to
Huawei's notches on a potential upcoming
device but Brendan you had some extra
thought you wanted to share real quick
we can use that as our as our quick cut
between these two topics yeah so I just
bought a device a very strange and kind
of old device but I'm so excited about
it
a few years ago phone was early was
released that was so thin and so light
that it just it changed the way you use
the phone like you could hope you could
hold it was so light that you could
watch videos in landscape just by
pinching it like this and it wouldn't
get tired and you know fall over like
that um any guesses what phone this was
the thinnest lightest not maybe not
lightest but the thinnest phone ever
released was the or5 the R the R 3 was
the first one ever okay that was like
the first film that didn't have a
headphone jack and so I I have one eye
I think I know I died now remember that
I don't have one first phone in the
modern age because that wouldn't have a
headphone jack because it just didn't
fit and that this is actually where Josh
and I met by the way in that event I I
was just about to say it sounds familiar
poor man yeah it was I'm talking about a
phone that is a full millimeter thinner
than the r3 yeah all right give me a
what year oh geez I'm gonna have to look
that up I mean we're talking like this
was us oh that's just 2016
I guess not that long ago two years ago
oh dear come on guys come on boil it
just boil it we don't have okay okay it
was the original moto Zio's five point
two millimeters so the cool thing about
the moto Z is that you can get a new
Moto Z and they have all these color
options like one is white and gold which
I got on Amazon for 229 bucks and the
software is a little outdated but you
can easily flash Oreo and Android P beta
onto it and it's just so sweet it's so
cheap and like it is so thin and like
that like it changes the way you use the
phone but it's had but it had like this
weird like the camera hump was
horrendous I oh yeah had that big ring
so that the Moto mods could attach to
and stay on and it was also missing a
headphone jack right of course yeah it's
not a perfect phone but it's cheap and
for those that like have never
experienced it it was just it's like for
watching video and it has a front facing
speaker so it's just it's perfect for
media consumption and it's so thin and
light that when you pick it up it's
effortless too tight because it's like
you're holding nothing at all yeah well
you know what I should have that I
should have asked you Brandon what you
were going
bringing up it would have been great to
use that as a segue to our motto z3 talk
a little bit later so I apologize for
mixing up the the topics a little bit
but let's get back to our our track here
speaking of the notches clearly there
are a lot of knotch devices out there
Google did say that there are 16 devices
from 11 OMS now speaking of those 16
devices a number of upwards of eighty
six million notch smartphones were
shipped globally in the first half of
2018 and it's probably no surprise given
their market but Huawei is at the top of
that list so any hot takes from you guys
about how because I heard you were just
talking Jaime about how you weren't a
big fan of their design of the notch but
it's the best-selling notch from
yesterday I I was filming some b-roll
for a video that's gonna go live on
Saturday if that oh my god like I had
literally six photos on the table with
notches all different things
so for me it's like well this is it you
know this is where things are going I
can't say that it's my favorite design
choice but it is what it is I just I
wish that companies became creative with
it like I honestly like the the approach
oddly the approach that I like the most
is one plus six and Apple where there is
very little chin at the bottom like I
don't have a problem with it so long as
the chin is not you know taking over you
know the the rest of the design it just
looks weird
asymmetrical okay Brendon has a few
technical difficulties oh there you go
there's a light in here that it's motion
activated and it automatically turns off
at certain intervals and you cannot you
cannot go like flailing for a little bit
[Laughter]
so why did you hide the camera that's
actually a moment we wanted to see in
about 20 minutes and I'll I'll just do
this Brendon have you used the peach one
yet all yet like like because right now
you have the one plus six and that's
your knotch device per se but have you
used the p20 yet because it's clearly
the best-selling knotch device right now
no but I did use the honor 10 for a
while which is like
kind of like the p20 light um but for a
while I was using the vivo necks which
I'm gonna hand off to a hi MA when I see
him next week and I was trying to figure
out if like not having a notch and
having like a very high screen to body
ratio is better than like a 1 plus 6 you
know which has this little notch and
like sometimes sometimes it's cool just
because when like your when it's sitting
on a table top it's kind of all
inspiring to see like so much screen but
but there are compromises of course to
that like on the Oppo find X you've got
yeah you've got to wait a second for the
whole thing to move up to take any
pictures at all or on the vivo necks
we've got that little front-facing
camera that pops up and again you have
to wait a couple of seconds for that to
happen I I rather have like a 1 plus 6
with a notch that's not that offensive
with no moving parts yeah I don't mind I
really don't mind yeah David Baptista de
Silva on Twitter says one notch is
already a design abomination so 2/3
half-a-dozen notches makes no difference
top notch for sensors and bottom notch
for fingerprint scanner at least would
keep the symmetry why is it here's the
thing how are bezels like not a design
abomination as well they store nothing
in them they stay anything but keep
everything to the sides and it's like
well like it's and it has structure so
it doesn't fall apart when you pick it
up you know it's like it's like that
yeah but it can't just hold everything
up right right here just another glass
you know don't worry
strum yeah and I mean perhaps the nod
like like I was saying one time before
the notches are gonna be a means to an
end as as manufacturers trying to find a
way to make it work or try to find a
ways of working around it we're gonna
get new types of form factors like the
fine 10 and stuff like that but as far
as Huawei is concerned the notch is
probably something that's going to
maintain and we have a phone coming up
from them potentially in the mate 20 or
the mate 20 Pro in this case which the
main piece of news there aside from the
fact that it probably will have a notch
to is that it's going to be Spore
potentially the akhirin 980 now we do
have a lot of good things that stay
generally about huawei's silicon they're
high silicon and if the ki-rin 980 is
going to be the case in the made 20 then
they're probably going to be a lot of
high-powered specs in general six
gigabytes of RAM 120 gigabytes of
storage a 4200 milliamp hour battery
I like that justjust think about the
fact that this would if the rumors are
true this would be the first ever seven
nanometer process processor yes I do
remember yes that that is that is the
thing I mean we're at ten nanometers
right now and everyone makes a big deal
about that going sub ten
I mean well here's the thing I mean
Intel hasn't like desktop processors
haven't reached ten nanometers yet and
so like mobile was really the like the
first which was what was the company
that that came up with the processor was
at media tech or or might have been I
can't remember tsmc tsfc is the one that
came up with with the design um yeah and
so like it's it's huge on its own it's
it that alone brings more power
efficiency because there's literally
less travel for you know everything but
that alone for me will be plus that
forty two hundred million power battery
and if they fit that triple camera from
the p20 Pro like I don't think there's a
need to look at anything else
right there I mean it's done for the
next five years
oh yeah this is not just my phone it's
v5 you're not gonna look at anything for
the next five years then maybe you can
donate that trip to China for me fair
enough wireless charging in display
fingerprint reader so you know I'm
really trying to put all of these
features right in there along with
Android P you say what you will about am
you I am II it's gonna be Android P
based my only thing about the Huawei
phones especially the made series is
that okay so likely it's going to be a
1080 a full HD plus resolution is the
only thing that kind of gives me pause
cuz and why not a quad HD display why
not I know it doesn't really matter so
much but you know do you have it all
been conservative yeah yeah yeah
do you have quad HD on your key - no I
don't I don't even
one plus six for goodness sake I have a
galaxy s nine plus here which I've been
using for the last few days and I have
it at 1080p Plus man like nobody uses
quad it's that's true that's true I I
completely agree with that and the are
their actual games to be had with a
1440p screen not necessarily but you
know it's just one of those things that
when you're looking at the spec sheet
before you actually get the phone in
your hand you're like oh well it doesn't
even have much of a presence in the VR
game because I don't know so maybe it's
just that I guess directing attention
away from any sort of investment in that
because obviously screens are one of the
few kind of parts that they have that
has to be outsourced because a lot of
stuff in China yeah I agree with that
okay so speaking of phones that are
incoming we are getting a little bit
more information regarding the red
hydrogen one I'm a little bit peeved
about this phone not necessarily because
of any bad reason but because I was I
was invited to that event that they had
in LA a number of weeks ago I wasn't
there I wasn't there this is the problem
I emailed them over and over again
saying will we get time with the device
because their hands on area blah blah
blah and they said you're not gonna be
able to do for that yeah yeah you're not
gonna do anything with it so I was like
okay like do I want to brave the LA
traffic to get all the way over there
and just like look at it and then be
like hey guys I saw as it turns out a
few people were able to touch the phone
at the event so I was a little bit
peeves about that but it's okay as it
turns out though the hydrogen one is a
hot device people are really looking
forward to it and speaking of putting as
many features as possible on here we
have four cameras we have a forty five
ten million power battery and speaking
you were talking about a thin device
earlier Brandon this thing is probably
not gonna be that okay yeah I'm gonna
need it how are the Holograms you pray
yeah pretty much
so we are plenty we're plenty that we
already know about the device it is
coming soon it's it's it's gonna become
a reality sometime soon and some
pictures are up that show contents of
the box a power delivery charger which
I'm all for I love power delivery and it
also shows off a few pieces of the
innards of the device itself aren't you
guys excited at all for the hydrogen
phone the hydrogen one rather I just I
can't imagine what the price of the
accessories is gonna be so that's that
phone I guess I'd have to see it I
haven't been able to see the whole
holographic thing they want to do I mean
is it gonna be useful or not it's the
first question but if that doesn't
really is if that's not really able to
stand on its own and if it's not able to
produce great photography on its own
without accessories then the question
begs what are the price of the
accessories that's gonna be the success
or lack of success of it yeah
and also like what like we still don't
really understand what benefits the
holographic display will bring is it
going to be like the HTC EVO 3d oh my
god or the Amazon fire phone has not
heard that in a while
oh my god what's interesting though
about the FCC listing is that if you
look at the model number of the hydrogen
one its h1 a 1000 which sounds to me and
this is total speculation like it's the
beginning of a series h1 a 1000 it
sounds like a nomenclature that would
suggest that there would be an h1 a
2,000 or an h2 a 2,000 or additional
variants of the of the one likely oh you
mean like the essential phone pH one
which actually if you look at that the
text actually stands for phone the h1
stands for phone that was true any yeah
yeah and so we're actually starting a
series here that hasn't been continued
yeah so ya never know I mean I am going
to have to recuse myself from this
conversation since I've been made very
privy to a lot of off-the-record
conversations at the motorola event
there was a Verizon guy there
and there's it has been an interesting
path in terms of red trying to get their
certification their network stuff it
together that's all I'll say
but I mean that could be tied to one of
the reasons why you were where you were
not allowed to take pictures or video of
the device at that event
yeah I'm kicking myself because I least
should have been able to see in concept
what they're trying to offer with this
phone but I wasn't there chalk that up
to a lesson learned for me whenever
there's an event in LA I freaking live
here I should just freaking go yeah
three numbers 405 yeah exactly you know
the 10 freeway I used to get in there
and is the worst I don't even go all the
way to the 405 I was about to say you
don't need to grab the 405 in your case
where you live exactly I just go five is
the worst all right so um speaking of
looking at the innards of a phone in the
case of the hydrogen one you are able to
look at the innards of another device
that I mean I would love to be able to
see in the flesh but there's a little
bit of controversy behind it we're
talking of course about the Xiaomi me8
Explorer edition now I'm sure you guys
have covered this before either on the
cast or in any of your content on the
other YouTube channel and on the website
but obviously there's there has been the
news that the me8 Explorer edition has
some extra bits under the cover that
actually aren't real it's literally
they're just for aesthetic and what's
funny is that it's not even like a
painted or like a picture that's
underneath that translucent glass on the
back it's an actual decorative board and
I think that's pretty funny to be honest
and if it gives a little bit of extra
look a lot of extra aesthetic to the
phone then I'm all for that but there is
the argument that if they didn't do that
they could have put a bigger battery
they could have added some other bits in
there any hot takes on this one oh so I
actually held that me eight Explorer
edition so I was at event at a small
event the Xiaomi head and
New York I just I don't get the point
first of all it looks like an iPhone
like it looks like an iPhone 10 in every
way so it's like it's this blend of
design which yeah I have no problem with
it it's just what's the point about that
the whatever you know art they have
they're like does it really serve a
purpose like but then again I'm not I
can't go hard on them because you also
have the HTC you 12 plus which you do
see the internals but there is like a
pattern being drawn over the casing to
make it look cooler but it's not really
that like the internals don't fully look
that way I mean it's not about really
deception for me it's more about just
using your space wisely and if I mean
there's a whole narrative about making
phones thinner and thinner and whatnot
and that's great I mean if you were to
take that board out you could have made
that phone dinner and you could have
used translucent glass anyways to show
off whatever was inside no matter how
weird it was because I think people in
having it would be so boring though if
you didn't have that there like it would
be translucent glass and then the heat
to impress all of my friends with this
phone because they I'm gonna say my
phone is see-through you can see the
motherboard that's where the brain is
okay you over there do you read pocket
now no look at this again very rig
everything variant of the v8 that's a
yeah you know what one thing I find
interesting about this decorative board
is that it very clearly shows the the
Snapdragon logo and kind of makes me
wonder like did Qualcomm you know kind
of throw some you know throw some in
there like hey that'd be cool if they
did because you know that's that's
branding that's good branding on their
part and that's their tentacles working
out in China again after a whole bunch
of debacles with the licensing over
there a few years ago fair fair uh well
yeah I mean I like the look of the phone
I would love to check it out I love I
would love to check out the me a in
general Xiaomi phones have this weird
thing where
it's clearly not completely finished the
time like a few updates later it becomes
the phone it was meant to be but even
then there are some brilliance there's a
little bit of brilliance and plenty of
the Xiaomi phones those just quick
flashes of it I actually really enjoyed
the portrait mode in the previous one
and Lord knows Xiaomi puts out stuff
like the me mix so yeah I mean there's
their flashes of brilliance on every
device that they make even if it's not
fully baked you I was not me UI man like
and I get it I get the purpose of their
software I know that the reason why
their phones are so affordable in China
is because of the whole mix they do
where they pretty much make more money
off their stores and everything that
makes all the sense in the world the
problem is god it's just so bad it is so
bad like I have a hard time finding
things in the settings because they
rearranged them completely and I and I
get it like even even a in something
that I'm working on you know I get that
they they have no reason to embrace the
Google approach because there is no
Google services in China I totally get
that
god it's so for me it's annoying it's a
very beautiful annoying phone I think
it's the best way can that be the can
that be a headline for you've got it all
right so there's no easy segue for this
last story okay without getting
political at all or really just even
social climate um what-what the hell
sprint just what the hell that's all I
want to say because they're trying to
marketing for the iPhone 10 in the
iPhone 8 are getting more aggressive
apparently but this video from Sprint
talking about this flash sale and they
took the word flash way too seriously
and actually okay my first question is
there were professional flashers like
that's an occupation and they got these
two people who are wearing this board on
their chests that say there's a flash
sale on the iPhone 8 and they're wearing
these humongous coats and they just run
in front of people are like blah flash
sale and I thought this was a good idea
like I'm all for
subversive marketing but this is
ridiculous my reaction from Jaime what
are you talking about the smith-lever
and all this is how you get me tuned the
best part is how the jackets are sprint
colors the outsides like dark blue and
inside it's yellow so it's like total
branding it's so cool this is absolutely
ridiculous I can't believe that they did
this because like you can even see it in
the faces of the people who got
quote-unquote flashed like what the heck
and like that's not how you you don't
jolt people into a sale like this is
this is so weird I'm gonna make a very
easy this is gonna sound sexist but I
guess if they would have grabbed these
like very beautiful models there the
result would have been so much different
I mean there are biases I mean the
picture that you guys have at the top of
this article shows a dude going up to
two girls that's the worst idea I'm sure
that if they got a couple of girls that
were the result would have been
different and you know what like you all
power to the sale itself like an iPhone
eight at sixty four gigabytes for $6.99
like that sounds pretty cool it's not a
thousand dollars so cool but this is not
the way you tell people about well the
thing is the flash sale was like eight
dollars a month so instead of $6.99 it
would be like 200 something so but yeah
this is a weird and it's especially
weird given that they did it in Kansas
City because I I see the streetcar it's
all got Sprint branding and that's their
hometown so way to kind of piss off your
home crowd I guess maybe I guess what do
you guys know about the future of Sprint
and t-mobile by the way like how's that
gonna any comment mode man yeah I've
never actually used Sprint as a carrier
I had once
amber when Sprint with
gonna skip LTE but and did WiMAX instead
oh god LT wasn't ready LT isn't ready
and so what they did was they adopted
WiMAX this was like back in the it was
it was a condition of the nextel merger
they had to do something by 2008 like
some advanced timeline and that was one
of the requirements for G by at that
time so yeah I love the I love this
question I'm looking at the chat by the
way everybody so be Floyd over on our
top chat who was broke enough to wear a
winter coat in the middle of 89 degrees
summer every time that I see somebody
like you know standing on a street
corner with a sign or something see
those jobs
I hate wouldn't people do those jobs
like I feel that companies I don't know
I consider that to be humanly degrading
to have somebody hold a sign I consider
that to be disrespectful to the
Employment Act of every citation right
exactly that's exploitation like every
time that I see something like that I
cringe and I get upset because I feel
company should be smarter about their
advertisement like seriously
exactly which is which is probably the
overarching point of this particular ad
can be smarter about this guy's yeah so
on that note we are going to take a
quick break I suppose yeah we'll be
right back with our main topic all right
this episode of the weekly is brought to
you by Jeff now helping you track your
Apple devices it's hard enough
remembering to keep your iPhone and iPad
in sight sometimes especially when
you're on the move or in a co-working
space or what have you but if you run a
business you know it gets even more
complicated than that and don't get us
started about managing fleets with
remote employees - Jeff now gives you
complete control over your inventory
allowing you to deploy uniform sets of
networking credentials apps and data you
can even lock or wipe a device at any
time best of all you have peace of mind
without having to take in hours of IT
lectures and you don't even have to pay
that much for it weekly listeners can
set up their first three devices for
free with each device after that just
cost
an extra $2.00 a month all you need to
do to get in on the deal its head over
to Jay a MF dot-com slash pocket now
that's JAMF that's a jam with an F at
the end JAMF dot-com / Puckett now for
your free account hey do you guys use
Google opinion rewards is that they do
surveys every sort of like have you
cashed out on it you get get free Google
Play credits for just compose baby like
that's twice a week and sometimes you
get like 10 cents kind of sucks
sometimes you like get some political
questions and you legit get like 85
cents credited to your Play account and
all you got to do is have this app on
your phone you guys look like three or
four surveys you get a couple of games
that's okay not even bad you can you can
fill out the surveys on your way or
while in the bathroom I mean it's just
like it's like it's like free money I
mean I'd be able to fill a ton of
surveys them how much how much worth do
you put into your bathroom breaks make a
good five bucks oh that is a nice way to
return from break
I mean segue from bathroom breaks I
suppose I don't know so um all right so
we have our we have remains high week
for today and Jules I'm gonna go ahead
and start off with you I think you have
a bit of a package that you wanted to
play it's the Moto XIII play I got in
front of me here and it's going to Josh
as soon as we meet during unpacked it's
gonna be great I actually unpacked it
for the video that I hope to have up
coming up this weekend on Monday and
it's a it's an interesting beast of a
swords yeah we had a whole meet up at
Motorola headquarters in Chicago
yesterday a whole bunch of the TUC the
tech press corps was there and she
wanted a bus I saw a trolley bus which
was nice but was had ineffective air
conditioning
so um yeah good thank you for that but I
do have a little piece that I do want to
play this one for our live streamers
here you're going to hear mostly from
just one person however for our audio
podcast which I hope you'll tune in to
you'll be hearing more wide array of
people from David Cogan being one of
them and as well as I think did hi out I
do one I think so I'm not sure I'm gonna
have to check back but in any case said
listen to this one here right here I
don't think the adapter is working here
yeah okay well in in any case then I am
just gonna have to play this out loud
and use the phone and it's like a do or
die
when everything doesn't work and
technology sometimes just happens to
throw everything in your path that
sounds like my Wi-Fi but you know what's
funny you've been consistent on this one
don't jinx it he's working on it so
obviously we're talk about the moto xiv
as we walk into the freaking revolving
doors and make more work for me because
i have to stop at this link later
there's a stream and I'm just gonna
probably not leave this in but hey
whatever the way to be wait another
street sweeper out there how many do you
want to ride it running goddamn street
sweepers okay alright now we're good
alright I'm sure let's turn this is
pretending that that didn't happen and
welcome mr. Michael fetch your p2 mr.
wobbles little segment on our podcast
here it's two minutes two questions you
ready I'm ready I'm it comfortably
ensconced in my quarter
if I were to be French I would call it
the model set leg because the whole 3mb
thing I don't know maybe but I have to
go German so I understand you said dry
would that be it knows it yeah just long
set over whatever I want to cut all this
let's cut I think there's a little
judgment that is to be had here because
you saw what happened you saw the spin
and the blush that they gave this
Meadows III thing yeah and it came from
all sides from Qualcomm verizon Motorola
yeah yeah so you got like you digest all
this information what is your initial
kind of takeaway after listening to all
that and then just you know seeing the
device holding it was it I have to be I
have to be frank you know there's a lot
of people here there's a lot of people
from the media here you know there's
like 20 people and on the other side of
the wall we're recording this from and
that's not even all the people Motorola
brought in to Chicago for this event so
frankly I expected a big splash and
their teaser said you know it's a whole
new way to like to communicate it's a
whole new way to have video calls a
whole new way to do everything whole new
yeah and you know what we got was of
course a phone that's this rather
unremarkable I think and a moto mod that
is very remarkable but it won't arrive
and for six months at least or I guess
four months at least
and we don't know what the price is
gonna be and we don't even know what
it's actually gonna look like since we
saw mock-ups today so like you know it's
really hard to take all that together
and say wow yeah I'm really jazzed about
what I saw today I'm not down on it I'm
just I have to say I'm expected a bit
more suffering in the mod for a second
here we got this up several times in the
course of conversation today but it's
always that thought experiment that we
have in terms of last year's flagship
phone versus this year's mid-range phone
and it seems like we seem to be hitting
a chord with that in terms of just you
know putting forward the package pricing
what not you
to reflect on offer just a little bit
and see how maybe a little initial
impression on how love us how well how
well doesn't just striking whatever that
is so weird right because the I'm
looking at the phone I'm holding in my
hand right now and several times today I
had to make sure I wasn't holding this
III play I brought along because this is
so similar I mean it's like the cameras
even I don't even verified this but I
think the camera module is exactly the
same we all talk but yet there's a force
which is a year old phone at this point
and that wasn't a very good camera and I
don't think this is a very good camera
either so you have that you have the
kind of design language that I was kind
of mad on on the XIII play you got this
weird power button on the left and the
fingerprint scanner on the side and
buzzing in your pocket all the time phew
visceral improvements they've made is
stretching out that screen a little bit
which facilitated that move button and
whatnot fingerprint sensor too yeah you
know I mean it's just you did the most
exciting thing about the phone to me is
the price 480 but then again it's 480 on
Verizon and you have to be on Verizon to
appreciate it
like this phone exists as a chassis for
the mod there's nothing special about it
unless you're talking about the 5g mod
and that's again tough to get excited
about I think review day is coming big
questions that need to be asked what's
one of them that you're hoping to answer
in a definitive way oh my god that's the
tough question Jules it's a good one
though right because it's easy to hedge
and be like yeah but you know Motorola's
great companies so yeah I think some
people buy this stuff I love this filler
yeah what's the question right right I
know what's the answer the answer to
your question about what my favorite
question is going to be it can't be
should you buy this phone because I
think you probably shouldn't unless you
know I that's not entirely true there's
use cases for it so that but that's not
the most interesting question the most
interesting question is by the time this
moto mod launches is it already going to
be irrelevant because it fully
integrated 5g
competitors will be out there and I'm
not sure I'll be able to answer that a
review time but it's one I'll be able to
pose I don't you know I can't
definitively say because I can't see the
future but it's just I can't be really
optimistic about a lot of us despite how
in love with the technology I am with
regard to the mod well that left us was
something to ponder at 1:00 a.m. on a
freaking Chicago night thank you so much
Michael Thank You Jules
always a pleasure indeed so yeah there
was a whole bunch of just reactions
mostly to the 5 G mod in terms of how
we're talking about this upgradable path
so that 5g moto mod that's not gonna be
that's the phone itself
Red's a Snapdragon 2 835 which don't
gain don't even get me started about
that but the fact is that last year I've
pointed this out last year the Moto z2
Force had a much more ambitious strategy
in terms of launch you know at all five
carriers all five major carriers I'm not
sure US Cellular would like be
accounting against that but you know it
was all around it was $700 this was a
$700 phone last year
now it's 480 there
Verizon's doing it on the 16th of august
and they're doing $300 trade-ins per
thing so it's like it'd be like a $200
phone almost and I don't know what do
you guys a what do you guys think in
terms of the first impression here what
what is the 5g mod what is inside of it
why is it so big like is it hot if
they're like they're like oh yeah so the
5g moto mod is basically the Qualcomm
Snapdragon X 50 modem which doesn't take
much space in itself but because of how
5g has to propagate because of its
license most of it is going to be in
that millimeter-wave area
it's kind of hard to get through even
the human kind of mass so all that is
going to be antennas it's a real weird
and misshapen little thing I'm gonna
pull it back up on the video stream for
a second here it's got another sort of
notch at the top above the camera sort
of but that's all antennas reaching out
making sure that there's proper coverage
so that even when you're holding it it
doesn't you know phase out and that's a
it's one of the concerns on going with
the 5g in terms of well just I mean the
5g standard itself can be used on pretty
much any spectrum the problem is is that
most of the spectrum that's usable is in
that upper range because everyone else
is already using the lower end for LTE
for a 3G for existing technologies and
they still have to run that for a time
so race on that thing no price given we
have to weigh in till early 2019
only gonna work on Verizon it's only
gonna work on Verizon phones under the
Moto Z thing so if you got your Moto Z
to force your Moto Z under Verizon it's
only gonna work the Moto mod is gonna
work for that if you bought it anywhere
else
tough luck but I'm trying to understand
like what you saw the recent survey that
included over how the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 you know a far
outperforms any phone that doesn't have
the chip so why go 835 and then make
people wait six months for 5g to use a
weird moto mod that's most likely not
gonna be it's not gonna be cheap and
then it's not like if you're you're you
have access to 5g everywhere like what
cities are gonna like I don't think 5
G's gonna be ready to launch into like
mid next year anyway so what's the I
don't know man I
so Verizon has an interesting narrative
here yeah yeah so but it's behind the
ball bit in terms of 5g it for
it was when that I think was the first
carrier to nap that I had plans just
general plans for 5g it turned out that
it was gonna be for fixed broadband it
would be like the enough towers going
out to base stations inside homes and
that would be their way in and then
everyone else started talking about
mobile 5g and their plans and the kind
of work caught behind with that so now
they're trying to say hey we're working
on this being the first phone it's a
Verizon exclusive and it's gonna be
upgradable upgradeable is their term for
5g which you know they I mean Snapdragon
X 24 on the Snapdragon 835 processors
processor that they have on the motors
III is gonna get you decent speeds it's
fine I guess it's but it's not even
Gigabit LTE capable that's the problem I
mean gigabit LTE came at the 8:45
so some tests were I'll be fair to
Qualcomm here some tests theoretical
tests only theoretical tests big
underline on that did provide the 8:35
with I think it was one point two
gigabit downlink but again the lab
conditions whatnot you're right so right
yes you're right yes yes but else he
came with the 8:35 and then it's like a
version two that we have with the 8:45
I guess terms yeah favorite terms that
they want to push out in terms of
getting the speed up and you know they
were all it was more of a Verizon
Qualcomm event I'll be honest in to has
been a Motorola V even though it was at
their headquarters Motorola's Chicago
headquarters it sound that there was a
lot more talking being done by the
Verizon representative there was a video
from Verizon
there was Qualcomm you know everyone was
there and they were talking about how 5g
is gonna be used for everything they had
a whole room set up even though all the
art assets were Motorola's like they
were like yeah this is how 5g is gonna
improve everything for VR AR your life
in general and you are going to be using
it
Jaime you and I we've we've been to
plenty of these types of events not
necessary for devices but for the con
- 5g with Qualcomm I mean tell me how
Hawaii it was like other than the whole
swimming with mr. mobile in the buff
though those feeds and those LTE speeds
look great in the studio my swim trunks
well you know it makes sense to me that
Verizon would be at the helm of
something like this because I mean I
don't know if there's really too much
argument here but in the u.s.
domestically Verizon is the most
reliable and fastest network for very
particular reasons though it's not going
to be something that's proliferated
easily across the globe because Verizon
is a very proprietary network band and
every time I use a verizon phone I'm
having a lot of fun with it because it's
real it's it's always speedy it's always
really awesome to you so I'm ok with
that I understand that Verizon is
probably going to be the the company
that brings this version of 5g to the
market but the problem that I have with
this is that clearly we're trying to get
to 5g because I think most of these
manufacturers and companies have just
given up on trying to perfect our
current LTE because we fall so far
behind compared to many other countries
in the world even a country like Estonia
just just wipes the floor with us even a
country like Condor desk has faster LTE
speeds I think we skipped LTE advanced
right like that thing so that's a good
question I don't know but so you can see
there's a thing I totally understand
like for example why is it Verizon
because Qualcomm and Verizon have been
partners since the inception of digital
you have to remember CDMA was invented
by by Qualcomm so and their first
partner was Verizon so I get that they
have a long term partnership and I you
know whichever company so that the
advantage of 5g is that it's a global
thing the the faster people adopt 5g the
easier it is for people to just stop
dropping off LTE and so it's it's a
win-win where people you know 5g is
gonna piggyback on LTE but it provides
the assistance and and it just you know
it liberates I guess is the word it
liberates a little spectrum because it
seems companies are not gonna be
investing more on LTE and have you guys
experienced regular H
va+ on carriers like AT&amp;amp;T I mean like 3G
is horrendous right now like if the
phone falls into 3G just forget it it's
the worst well unlike AT&amp;amp;T you go to
HSPA+ which it's bad really
probably affiliates great but in New
York it's like the worst man Wow
but maybe it's just too much to ingest
it yeah literally edge on t-mobile edge
on t-mobile while roaming is faster than
HSPA+ on a vow it is that bad like it
certainly I would rather tell me it's
not connected I mean that's the kind of
mean meaning that you would like to have
hope but I want to get back to the z3 in
that it's a shuttle for this you know I
mean I guess propaganda about 5g which
you know I mean it's it has it's valid
points but it's a shuttle this z3 is
getting jettisoned it's gonna I feel
like it's gonna be out the door by
whenever come next year when all the
integrated solutions all the ones that
have the snapdragon 855 inside and does
you don't need a freaking 5 Jima to
achieve those speeds and pricing is
enticing though and I you know I think I
didn't see the motive unfortunately you
have jewels but you know all moto mods
are like that they're all chunky so I
think it's just the design thing I don't
think it's a it's an antenna like in the
old days you know you remember those
antennas for like the satellite phones I
don't think it's a necessity I think it
was yeah you almost look like you you
almost look like you're holding a
satellite phone with this thing to and
which is funny to me because the image
of somebody holding up this moto mod and
the phone to their face is funny because
that's not what the 5g modems for yeah
but what I'm thinking here is so as
Fisher was saying in that clip by the
way great job on that one Jules the
the whole idea behind this mod is that's
gonna come out within four to six months
from now but by the time this mod comes
out is it is it in line with or at least
coming up close to a potential Z for
launch
so like this this mod is obviously
suppose to be backwards compatible with
this phone and the next phone so I can
see why the timeline is the way it is
but still like it only really makes
sense to buy the mod if it's expensive
with this phone because potentially the
z4 is gonna be the one that comes in at
at least $6.99 and then you're painting
way more out the butt with that but then
you're probably around that time you
know come early next year you might be
looking at a Galaxy S 10 with built in
5g the only I guess I think it's just
the selling points not where it's like
you know we're giving you a phone that's
gonna be 5g capable so if you buy this
phone now you will be able to connect to
5g whenever it's available and since
people hold onto phones for more than a
year I guess they're just trying to make
it a marketing stunt I get it I would
make more sense to me if the Moto line
that the Z line from moto was like the
only phone on Verizon and if like stuff
like the s10 wouldn't be coming to
Verizon if something like whatever the
next phones iPhones are going to be
didn't have the potential to have this
type of technology weren't going to be
on Verizon in the first place because
remember the old nobody the old days but
like remember how a moto droid was like
the number one line on Verizon like that
that was there was a certain exclusivity
behind that but if all of these other
phones are definitely coming and they
probably are going to have this kind of
tech then it makes this harder to sell
aside from the price point except that
it's August 2018 and like there's no s10
and it's not even in sight and so if
you're a Verizon customer walking a
Verizon store and you're like okay I'm
gonna spend a bunch of money on a phone
I want to be a little bit future proof
and the sales guy is like hey buddy
what's up what's your name Michael
Fisher is gonna be so pissed at you
trying to act like him selling next
telephones right sales reps gonna be
like yo dude we've got this phone that
can get it on our next generation of
cellular technology that's not even out
check out this moto z3 with the 5g mod
you should buy this phone and you'll be
happy in two years from now because
you'll be on the fastest speeds so it's
it's like it's great for right now
before you know we get to early next
year you know we have a future-proof
phone with it with last year's processor
that is exact and you know like motorola
is like the worst when it comes to and
when it comes to Android updates
all right have they gotten better there
I use the Moto phone in a while they're
kind of checkered in terms of that
because the you know it they treat their
flagships okay but you know I mean we
had that debacle with the Moto G 4 and
Android
um yeah I was the OREA and it was like
they Oh
we had a misprint in an ad for the Moto
G 4 plus saying that it would get Oreo
it wasn't supposed to but you know what
we'll honor our word is to get years of
one year of updates so we have we heard
you loud and clear everybody here you go
that's pretty much it the one thing that
this makes me think of before we before
we call it on this one okay it's
obviously in a mod there are a couple of
issues there are a couple of worries
that I have there might be unfounded
that you know the modem has to get the
data then funnel it through the contacts
you know that that might actually make
it slower than it should be it's like
thinking about how this mod has a 2000
million power battery inside of it just
to power the dang thing you know cuz
obviously there's a lot that it has to
do to get the most optimal speeds that
are called 5g could I'm not as
optimistic that our next-generation
phones next year are going to have this
tech because it's going to be a battery
suck and they're not gonna want to have
that in in the new flagship phones could
we see 5g mods coming out that are
peripherals that are that that can be
connected let's say via us PC to the
phones in the future because it requires
this amount of power and extra battery
if you remember from the presentations
that we've that we've seen from Qualcomm
I don't expect them to be a battery hog
because they they piggyback on out
he and it's it's actually from what from
what we understood there was until
impact in battery it was actually the
other way around
it's all about it's all about signal
strength yeah I'm yeah when you have
five bars at its 5g and and it's an its
pervasive and it penetrates walls your
phone doesn't have to do that much to
send and receive extra circuitry in what
has to be done to get those 5g speeds to
the motors III I think is going to
generate some heat sink effect or at
least you know use up more power than
would be otherwise needed because I
because you're right we we did see a lot
of these demos I'm a but like looking at
this mod I just keep looking at it I'm
like there's way more in here than I
remember Qualcomm claiming would be
needed so I'm a little bit worried about
that I mean it is about a mod it has to
fit the Moto G design and there has to
be you know kind of usable I guess so
yeah yg so in the five years different
to every other generation of
connectivity like 1g was analog 2g was
digital 3G was you know high higher
speeds I believe it was or I'm trying to
remember but then LT that all these were
like different antennas whereas 5g is
actually the 5g can't survive without
without LT it needs LTE to you know be
able to to provide what you know the the
signal so it's not like if the phones
are gonna ship without LT they need LT
it's it's it's part of the spectrum um
well a meter wave is only useful when
you're outside it's not useful when
you're inside for example it's those
kind of like 3G was the UMTS and then a
piggyback on that was the HSPA and HSPA+
it so you it's still used to the 3G UMTS
connection but it was almost like an
add-on that's exactly so far that much
was clear to me if I'm G requires a
combination of everything we already
have yeah yeah exactly
yeah that's are like a potluck soup like
for everyone it's a network jambalaya
put it out for a second here with the
the phone and the keys or the guy dude I
am so envious so back in the day fun
fact
unload us and just how bad things were
so I had cable for the first time until
I was eight and we only had one W cheeto
so I grew up and the I grew up watching
the clubs and that was like literally
the only thing you can watch I was a
whole eSports you can watch was Harry
Caray Steve stone and then Tom what was
it the other guy here at Wrigley Field
for the Cubs game so for me like I was
like damn it I have to change my flight
that you guys are going to Wrigley Field
man yeah it's like for me it would have
been sorry man I'm free to be there I am
so envious - all right listen if you
have a little off time and I'll pay for
your ticket actually take you up on that
man the myth the legend Jules over there
in the production as well and and yeah
don't let it don't let it don't let it
be a don't let it be a false claim it's
it's gotta happen before that it happens
[Laughter]
it has to go to a Dodgers game maybe I
don't know maybe that will be have to be
the case but we'll see all three of us
exactly okay so speaking of things that
are announced and usually never coming
to light we have one final thing to talk
about so here comes Roy oh boy oh boy oh
boy here comes a beautiful name from
announcer a beautiful company the Hubble
phone this is a concept from a company
that we all know way too well and I
actually have a bone to pick myself
because at my previous at my previous
place of work I did do a lot of work
with this company touring and I was at a
lot of their like-like-like press
briefings and stuff like that and they
were always they always were really
forthcoming with information regarding
their devices and the fact that things
were going to like this really a
revolutionary film but they had a lot to
say about their phones and like the last
one do you what was it called the
appassionato or the appassionato I think
it was which had like a cool name and
what made me feel like it was actually
gonna be a reality was because they gave
me a working unit and I was able to
actually review it as long as I did some
software updates and then they were like
even though they had a partnership with
TCL they were like nah we turns out what
we can do just like what's why what do
what is wrong with what is happening
here like I I felt slighted because I I
was with them for hours and actually
here in Pasadena and I was with them for
hours just talking about this phone and
having having fun talking about like
what they wanted to do with it this
concierge service that they were going
to bring with the phone that I actually
used a couple of times and I thought it
was really awesome I thought it was
really cool made the phone feel
exclusive and then they just sort of
like turn their backs just like they did
with the original touring phone and it's
like ok here they are again with a flip
phone concept that I mean it's totally
coming out in the first quarter of 2020
just so you know sure let's go back up
to that notch there's like 15 sensors in
it go up which notch you mean the one
that's on the main screen the one that's
on the secondary screen the one that's
on the rear screen that's before that
doesn't want yeah exactly it's on the
long edge okay so both we will get into
the actual device itself like they are
saying that it's going to have their
custom OS is gonna have Android P it'll
potentially have a custom Snapdragon 855
and like what are you talking about and
can I do the honors because I have it
right in front of me here go for it
all right so this this thing here
imagine you know Samsung's Chinese flip
phone that has the
the Snapdragon in every blow think about
like yeah the w so much better yeah
great it's amazing I'm sorry about this
but in any case this dual Snapdragon 855
so with the and there is a 60 megapixel
camera that's at the hinge so it's like
it's pointing outwards and the the flip
screen like you can turn on a different
axes so that you can use it as a
viewfinder and there's also like dual 12
megapixel sensors here there's a kind of
a structured light thing for facial
recognition and there are 12 megapixel
freaking 5 cameras here any of the five
I don't think I see no oh is mentions in
any of this there's 15 times octave
optical zoom for the 16 megapixel thing
though and variable aperture from 2.8 to
5 point 6 so I mean they're just they're
thinking about hey what numbers on this
screen can we put that sound vaguely
realistic in the next couple of years
but you know look at that hinge
mechanism that's sticking out on the
side right there and yeah I mean it's a
crazy concept and like I always say
concepts are gonna be awesome to see
that's why I actually I allow the notch
in my life because I like to see things
like the Opel fine 10 and stuff like
that happen or the vivo necks and all
that and this is the thing those phones
actually made it to market so that's the
difference here and when the first
turning phone came out and I was able to
view it it got a lot of views it was it
was obviously something that people
wanted to see and then it never really
went anywhere
and then the appassionato came out and
then I was able to actually hold it and
whereas I originally said I'll see I'll
believe it when I see it I did and then
it didn't go to market so this is what
I'll say with this one I'll believe it
when I
see someone buy it I'll believe it when
I see someone actually give a card to
somebody at a manufacturer or a carrier
and say I will have that fun please
thank you goodbye because that has never
happened with this company never so I
remember I remember little Michael
Fisher since he was on the show I can
reference this I remember he he asked me
like why you did a really good piece on
the appassionato are you are you at all
like I don't know how you could do that
knowing what their track record is and
that was I was very optimistic at the
time and I always am when it comes to
tech I'm the kind of guy that says oh is
this phone the best one no because all
phones are amazing you know like why
don't we say all things are amazing
right now that's the whole point of life
right now is that everything's cool and
it's like why would I pick a side when
everyone can benefit and I'm the
positivity dude and that's what that's
the that's the mentality I had going in
tutoring and they've always disappointed
sucks to have Lego Batman be so
disappointed by something Jaime popped
up for a second there but I wanted a
thank you for juicing my connection by
the way the show and it was only for a
little bit so thank God question for you
I I ranted for a little while about
Turing and the relationship I had with
them now have you had your run-ins with
turning a 0-0 relationship it's okay it
was weird and I guess I don't know man
what they were trying to offer initially
was looked like you know what this looks
like this looks like southall CES you
know the South Hall where you find
there's like the cesspool of the voices
concepts that pretty much will never
make the light of day that's your that's
what it you know it looks like something
that I don't even see the functionality
in the product I mean hey prove me wrong
yeah it's one of those cases where
whenever I see concept designs I'm tired
of it it's just don't show me a concept
show don't be something that you're
gonna launch this is like you know in
most companies I feel that they make the
mistake of creating I think we've just
gone through so much in the mobile space
where you
remember like Windows Phone 7 it was a
lot it was announced in January it was
launched in December like whatever you
do something like that you literally
killed the products buzz you create buzz
and then it just dies out and so
whatever you you make these
announcements of a concept that's two
years away like what do you expect for
people to remember who you are three
months from now he's gonna care and so
you don't do yourself a favor companies
like turning whatever don't do this like
I think that I think that red is making
a big mistake with their hydrogen-1
teaser I think that they would have just
made an event you know let the rumor
mill play itself red is working on a
phone red is working on a phone that's
you know that's all cool and then boom
three months later just launch a damn
thing I think that that's gonna have a
better effect then show me a concept
that's just gonna allow the the big guns
like Samsung to actually put their RMD
into hey can we do this and they'll pull
it off we have to remember that red is
film fans it's not just you know
smartphone fans I think there's a good
cross-section there but they're more
into you know digging into color space
and whether I mean they have their own
forms that's where we've been getting
all of this information and you just
wanted to be transparent at that said he
has his own kind of this James argent
Jannard
who is running the place he has his own
kind of cult of personality there and
sometimes tenets that forget it's in the
way things
forgive my face but yeah I totally agree
with you there and like especially with
what turning like one day if they ever
do put out a phone it's going to be on
the back of all the controversy that
they create for themselves like do you
want to be infamous and then you prove
that you can do something like that's
that's that seems like their path right
now and I guess my smartphone
manufacturers let me let me give you
this the reason why concepts work in the
car industry is because they make it
very clear from the outset this is a
concept you're never gonna see this on
the road if you do it's gonna be
radically different from this and even
if it is like this we're going to make
that announcement later then you don't
come up with like
these renders that and then say hey this
is gonna be on two years you don't know
it doesn't work that way I mean look at
vivo vivo didn't even show their phone
out to anybody you know the concept
phone that eventually became the next
very few people were able to see it and
then boom just out of the blue we have
the vivo next four months later see
that's how you do it
yeah that's that's how you do it but
like like what of what of this concept
is even possible it's like whenever I
see those concepts of the galaxy as nine
I'm like yeah I mean just remove the
bezels in Photoshop anybody could do
that like it's not gonna happen like
technology doesn't really work that way
so you know whenever I see those concept
designs you know it's there no offense
to Evers into that industry it's all
great but you know in the case of Turing
like whatever I'm like every like I
didn't even cover that in daily like it
was Sam Kane came up to me and he was
like oh yeah dude look at this this
looks really cool and I'm like you're
too young you have no idea how much
paper we're we're exposed to at CES come
on no what Brandon make the dance I have
to throw something at the light switch
work to work see that is a perfect
perfect Ferris Bueller's Day Off I think
I think that is a perfect way of calling
it on this one one thing I did I want to
give a shout out to you real quick Jules
because this final line of the Turing
one I love how you do this it's called a
mobile phone right so this is what Jules
wrote no pricing has been announced but
we do know that the Hubble telescope ran
up to an initial cause of 1.5 billion
dollars in 1990 to command more than 20
billion and maintenance co-researcher oh
