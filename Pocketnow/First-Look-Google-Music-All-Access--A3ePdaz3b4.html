now google has launched its spotify
competitor google music all access and
we're going to show it to you so the
premise of google play all access is
that Google can do a better job of
learning and eventually predicting what
you want to hear than other services at
least in theory it's going live in geo
specific areas right now and if you're
in a live market like the u.s. you can
sign up for a trial read the fine print
here though you pay per month once the
free trial is over but the plus side is
it's seven ninety-nine a month instead
of 999 if you sign up now it would have
been nice to see Google try and be a bit
more competitive on pricing against
services like Spotify but for early
adopters or Google fans the eight dollar
price versus the ten dollar price is a
nice incentive once you update the
google music app on your phone you'll
see the new interface with the revised
features I didn't even have google music
and my quick apps because I didn't find
it terribly useful before but maybe the
new features will change that popping in
you can see my library which is the
repository of your tracks you can search
for your favorite artists and add an
album here and google has also
pre-populated my library with some music
it thinks I'd like we'll see you can tap
any of the tracks you've put in your
library to start them playing and it
will auto populate the album art and
such though it looks like there's a
warping problem with this particular
example it's cool that it pans and scans
across the art though this interface is
familiar from apps like Spotify and it's
easy to navigate within my library you
can organize by song album genre and so
on and you can also hop back out to the
main menu tree to check out google
auto-generated playlists create radio
stations which should improve as you
listen more and explore which is
supposed to make it easy to figure out
what to play next again based on how
often you use it hopping back to
playlists to answer the million-dollar
question yes you can add entire albums
to a playlist and yes you can download
them directly to the device for offline
listening finally hopping into settings
we see the familiar tweaks and account
level controls in fact a lot of this is
very familiar indeed when we put it
right up next to Spotify it's up to time
to determine whether it's a more
compelling offering in the long run if
you think it will be
you can save two bucks a month every
month by signing up before june
thirtieth in the meantime we hope you've
enjoyed this quick tour of google music
all access stay tuned to pocket now for
much more from Google i/o 2013 and
beyond
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
