now google has launched its spotify
competitor Google Music all access and
we're going to show it to you so the
premise of Google Play all-access is
that Google can do a better job of
learning and eventually predicting what
you want to hear than other services at
least in theory it's going live in geo
specific areas right now and if you're
in a live market like the US you can
sign up for a trial read the fine print
here though you pay per month once the
free trial is over but the plus side is
it's $7.99 a month instead of $9.99 if
you sign up now it would have been nice
to see Google try and be a bit more
competitive on pricing against services
like Spotify but for early adopters or
Google fans the $8 price versus the $10
price is a nice incentive once you
update the Google Music app on your
phone you'll see the new interface with
the revised features I didn't even have
Google music and my quick apps because I
didn't find it terribly useful before
but maybe the new features will change
that popping in you can see my library
which is the repository of your tracks
you can search for your favorite artists
and add an album here and Google has
also pre-populated my library with some
music it thinks I'd like we'll see you
can tap any of the tracks you've put in
your library to start them playing and
it will auto populate the album art and
such though it looks like there's a
warping problem with this particular
example it's cool that it pans and scans
across the art though this interface is
familiar from apps like Spotify and it's
easy to navigate within my library you
can organized by song album genre and so
on and you can also hop back out to the
main menu tree to check out Google
auto-generated playlists create radio
stations which should improve as you
listen more and explore which is
supposed to make it easy to figure out
what to play next again based on how
often you use it hopping back to
playlists to answer the million dollar
question yes you can add entire albums
to a playlist and yes you can download
them directly to the device for offline
listening
finally hopping into settings we see the
familiar tweaks and account level
controls in fact a lot of this is very
familiar indeed when we put it right up
next to Spotify it's up to time to
determine whether it's a more compelling
offering in the long run if you think it
will be
you can save two bucks a month every
month by signing up before June 30th in
the meantime we hope you've enjoyed this
quick tour of Google Music all access
stay tuned to pocket now for much more
from Google i/o 2013 and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
