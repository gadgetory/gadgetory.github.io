hear of extra odd charges from retailers
Samsung has appointed new leadership
when we hear record earnings from the
company and according to Google the
pixel to excel and pixel to have
surpassed expectations I'm high metal
Iveta praying for the victims of what
just happened in the city
definitely patron needs to end this is
parking out daily the official loose
today begin with deals and these deals
extend to things you care about Sam's
Club is currently offering something
that is a little too good to be true but
there are a ton of conditions like
activations and everything you can learn
more about the conditions in like a
description the point being is that you
could get up to 250 dollars off any
high-end smartphone and that actually
includes the iPhone 10 again you can
learn more in the description now the
company that is not offering deals and
is actually generating confusion is Best
Buy you can learn more about what's been
going on over the last couple of days in
the description as well the company was
charging $100 and it's not charging
these anymore for the iPhone 10 and
apparently it had everything to do with
the fact that a lot of people wanted the
phone without any sort of carrier
activation and according to Best Buy the
only way to give you the retail price of
the iPhone is if you bought it with an
activation which is totally weird you
can buy the phone without that at an
Apple store and I don't really
understand what's going on with profits
again Best Buy has stopped doing this
but just buyers beware now sorry about
Microsoft and the company's surface Pro
lte-advanced I don't know where they got
that name but this is the LT model that
we've been waiting for remember that the
company pretty much said that we should
expect the device to be available in
December well the news are that you will
be getting it in December so long as
your business customer apparently
they're not really launching it for
everybody at least not initially but you
can stay tuned and learn more we will be
covering as soon as we learn more
information that was a spotlight over to
Samsung as the company has just
announced changes in leadership a lot of
it could have to do with the legal
problems that the company has been
dealing with in its higher leadership in
Korea we're not exactly sure if that's
going to be the case we do know that the
co-ceos that were have just
down including JK shen and now we get
new leadership and you can get details
in the description most important I
don't think it's going to bring any
changes to the smartphone division at
least initially
I hope not at least because everything
that we've seen so far has been awesome
still most important as well as that the
company has also announced record
profits so hopefully that will help the
company bring even better products next
year and finally the very hot news today
have to do with sundar pichai in a
statement confirming the Google pixel to
in pixel to excel have sold more at
least twice as much as the pixels did
last year according to the try a lot of
it had to do with the fact that the
company changed its go to market
strategy in addition to extended other
countries and other markets to be able
to sell this phone and this is all great
I think that the pixel to excel which is
the one that I've been using lately has
been a great phone and almost everything
we've got a couple of videos over the
next couple of days that will show you
what we like and what we don't like most
important today is the question what do
you think about the pixel have you
ordered it have you been testing it do
you like it are you upset with the
display problems in my case I don't have
the bluish tint issues in my unit but
the screen is dull I'll be covering it
