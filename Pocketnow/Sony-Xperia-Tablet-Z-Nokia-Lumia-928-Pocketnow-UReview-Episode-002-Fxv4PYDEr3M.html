glad that we are both nice and tan and
it looks like we are on air hello
everyone and welcome to episode 002 of
the pocket now you review the hangout
series from pocket minimal where we let
you the listeners viewers and readers
pocket now ask us questions and give us
your opinion about the hottest and
newest devices on the market today's
device the Sony Xperia tablet Z
alongside because there hasn't been all
that much interest in the review on this
one we'll get to that in a second
alongside the Nokia Lumia 928 welcome
aboard and I'm Michael Fisher editorial
director of pocket now the room is
filling up and if you're coming into the
room just now I will ask you to please
mute your mic on the way in just like we
do in the pocket now live and I am
joined today by multimedia manager Jaime
Rivera I'm a welcome aboard good
afternoon and good morning to certain
people and as Taylor said he had coffee
last time I have water this time you
have water as well alright so I have a
giant bucket of dunkin donuts as usual
actually this is number three today I
should please explain to me why why is
your devotion to dunkin donuts coffee I
i will explain you at first i have to
tell you that normally the bottom of a
cup of ice to dunkin honors coffees
about that much like sugar yeah and
there's none in this one so it's very
very bitter dunkin donuts is a big
boston thing it's a national chain but
in boston is just like huge for some
reason so starbucks isn't that big of it
uh starbucks is huge is huge but not in
boston um i mean it is huge in but it's
not as big as Dunkin Donuts so anyway
that's the deal will while we while we
wait for the for the room tube to fill
here I want to make clear now Jaime you
were talking about something earlier you
you have not reviewed the either of
these devices you haven't even had
hands-on time of them is that right I
did with with the tablet Z with the
template see okay minor very minor Lee
and it at a store here were they when
they announced it here hmm what were
your impressions I love the tablet
honestly you know I you know if I would
if I had any
fran for big android tablets i love that
tablet myself my problem is that I'm you
know if you if you want an android
tablet the smartest thing to do is to
get a nexus 7 because applications still
don't scale well to the larger tablet
you know form factor so it's always an
exercise in frustration it's like china
clay Spotify or trying to use the
Facebook app it's like terrible on oh
yeah it's really great my favorite part
about it is firing up Spotify and a 10
inch android tablet and watching it
rotate into portrait and they split
itself at all exactly so you know the
problem is not really the tablets how
much beautiful the problem is using it
yeah I'm using it for the usual things
that you would use a tablet which is not
necessarily what the manufacturer
intends you to do with the built-in
applications you want to do more with it
right and I do wonder actually a little
bit about it how much of that is
affecting the response here because we
tend to meet her everyone we tend to
meet her a review not just based on
analytics because we don't always happen
two pocket knives analytics for too busy
but you can kind of easily get a
barometer reading on how popular pieces
by how many comments it's generating I
may you know something about this you
get about 400 comments a piece because
you're always during the S up somehow
and you know but but the thing is that
with the Xperia tablet Z review and the
Z is here for everybody just joining us
and right here star of the show for
today uh disease comment count is so low
it just seems to be so much so little
interest in it which is a shame because
it is such an unbelievably thin and and
really quite beautiful tablet so we're
going to get to talking about it we've
got a little bit of a room load here we
got some familiar faces some new faces I
love the mix so let's get started how
might you haven't been on the show
before since this is the first time
you're joining us we'll break down the
format for you and for anybody new to
the you review this is how we do it
we're going to every viewer that we
select is going to have a five minutes
to ask us questions about either of
these devices the Xperia tablet Z or the
Nokia Lumia 928 please have specific
questions have specific observations we
want to keep the discussion confined to
these devices otherwise it's just
another episode of the pocket now live
and while that's fun we already do that
once a week so please keep that lens in
mind and for this particular one we're
going to be asking folks a couple folks
to stick around
the end of the show we're going to steal
an idea from the pocket not weekly and
maybe do a little two-minute debate
corner if time allows sound good to you
hymen that's perfect sounds awesome well
I will ask you as I think I asked taylor
an episode 12 dutifully please select
our first guest for episode two okay we
are going to select mr. Verdi earnest
haven't met you before we're all right
okay maybe I 30 yes you've a familiar
face I think we have you been on that
life before or no no this is my first
time so oh well welcome in that case i'm
sorry i miss misidentified you welcome
to the you review yeah thank you uh I
won't talk about the xperia z tablet yes
right here um i have the ipad mini okay
and and do it it works good for me but
i'm thinking is it as light as the ipad
mini or is the ipad mini lighter so how
many how many grams is the ipad mini can
we look that up real quick okay
vacations focus on your side and I look
for them thank you so what I've been
telling people Freddie first of all
where you got where you calling from
from the Netherlands from the
Netherlands okay nice i like we should
have like a like a little pimp push pins
for where people call in from i I've
been talking about this tablet as though
the way people have been the way i've
been explaining it to people is that
it's like a nexus 7 yes at 10 inches
like it's that portable this Way's 495
grams yeah okay so i've had many as
three hundred and twelve grams for the
4g LTE variant okay so this is like what
more than more than twenty-five percent
heavier than the ipad mini which i'm not
surprised at because the ipad mini I've
handled in and it feels like almost like
a dummy tablet to me yes so yeah it's
like until you something I mean I it's
not that I measured them it's just when
I held the tablet Z and then the demo
that I saw it that the launch here um it
was I felt that just this thin I mean
what is the thickness do you have
number because it's a yeah it's six
point nine millimeters on the okay so
here's the thing the iPad Mini is 7.2
millimeters so the iPad Mini is actually
thicker thicker than this and exactly
yeah it was so much fun to film this
Ferdie because I mean like you know you
can find different angles to do it from
and it just it looks impossible i think
sony has a little image up where they
put a pencil up next to it you know to
answer your question like when you read
in bed you know when you do this thing
and you're like you hold it up like this
the it is so easy to do and it's so easy
just to hold with one hand while you're
typing on it the portability of this
besides the water resistant nature is
the best aspect of it in my opinion yes
you did the review on the Xperia Z
tablet and what I thought was it was
funny when you lifted the ipad and i had
i had the problem with the ipad me i had
held it on above my head when I was
sleeping almost and then I dropped it
but I have glasses so I broke my glasses
I've never you broke your glasses with
the matter these are new pairs of oh man
I thought that was only you know because
I have the big one I recited the big
ipad 3rd generation and man that thing
as heavy as anything but yeah broke your
glasses with the mini man I'm sorry to
hear that Graham yeah yeah hazard maybe
a welding mask for for using a tablet
yeah do you have any any any other
questions on that on the tablet II know
about the about the 928 yes awesome some
leaks about the nokia e use what would
you think would be better than 928 or
the eros compare just just the phone so
we were talking about this on the weekly
today we recorded the pocket night
weekly podcast earlier today and we were
discussing that very thing now this is
the the Nokia Lumia 928 now it's white
and so the camera is going to have like
a harder time with it but you can see
the Xenon flash there yes yeah but also
you can see this lens module is the same
exact one we're familiar with from the
920 it actually I believe it is hardware
identical so the EOS if it lives up to
the promises if it lives up to the leaks
we're
probably going to be seeing a very
substantial increase in quality all
around we hope so i think you know
they're not going to be in the same
class I don't think yeah because you
here in turn about the 808 PureView and
he loves the phone but it's a brick I
mean it's it's thick and you see have
you seen the latest leaks of the of the
ears yeah it has a big camel hump on the
back around camera home but yeah it
doesn't look appealing it looks a little
bit ugly like how do you say The
Hunchback of nuts without it you know it
does i mean it's it's going to be an
acquired taste i as i said on the on the
podcast today I don't know I'm gonna ask
jaime for his opinion on it too just to
get him talking for a second like I
think it is so ugly it's beautiful if
that makes any sense I think it has that
really disgusting that appealing
disgusting factor I mean what do you
think about it you know probably my
biggest question is do you think that
that hump is a replaceable cap oh dude
hahaha a replaceable lands on a
smartphone camera that would no i don't
i don't think that but that would be
amazing i mean that's the design looks I
don't know the design right maybe you
can change the colors of the cab maybe
yeah now I was debating you know
yesterday when I was preparing the
script for parking out daily I was like
man this thing looks so fake and then it
looks so real at the same time it
depends on which photo you look at so
the thing about the EO says I feel that
at the beginning it's gonna be a niche
product just because it you know it
brings something to the table that's
revolutionary but a lot of people value
thin and light a lot of people value
Portability and so I don't think it's
gonna be easily adopted at the beginning
until nokia probably figures out a way
to scale down but you know it's gonna be
a good it's gonna be a good proof of
concept it's gonna be like the Galaxy
Note well and for all speaking speaking
of which I'm pick them taking notes on
the on the note I'm Tim keeping score on
the nose exactly I wouldn't bother
galaxy note of the beginning they're
like what that
gonna use this i mean what i was talking
the size so you know and then it found
quite a quite a niche for itself and so
uh do you now that the 928 though is is
just you know pretty the easiest way i
can describe it is that it is it is just
a squared off 920 with some
differentiators that are not great in
particular these you know these these
buttons here which you can't see because
very crappy webkinz are no longer
ceramic there are you know plastic so
before we let you go for di want to ask
because we forgot to do this until the
end of the show last time would you just
in a general sense would you give the
Xperia tablet Z a thumbs-up or a
thumbs-down definitely thumbs up because
it's a real thing tablet and I would
like to get my hands on one too
hopefully it's nothing stores yet in
Indonesian so the Xperia Z is but i have
an iphone 5 with with a wide angle lens
so yeah ok let me invade you within much
this really nice with the cover let me
invade you with a question because I've
seen those lens covers all around is the
photo quality dramatically improved that
alone when you look in the middle of the
photo it's really sharp like the normal
lens itself but every lens when you put
on a lens it's going to be a little bit
difficult but the sides there a softer
mmhmm yeah I want to me that the middle
is sharper than the center weighted yeah
its centre metered let me ask you before
I get off the scorecard here because we
do if we move on the Lumia 928 thumbs up
thumbs down middle middle middle middle
area all right I will let you do metal
it will do the score while I love is the
official storage phone but it is a good
phone but how they say it's it's not as
different as the 920 I understand I you
know and I feel the same way I said as
much in the review and I'm glad I'm not
the only one who feels that way Ferdie
thank you so much for joining us and
thanks for being our first guest on
episode to thank you it was a pleasure
it was the first time so I'm a little
bit excited so thank you I
we're a lot excited thank you seriously
it was it was great to have you on and
hopefully we'll see on a future one love
yoga every pocket no host guy who works
there so I love your reviews and keep
all good thank you thank you sir sorry
you know one thing that you that you
said on the review that was like
striking for me was the design of that
928 being so it fixes the problem of the
920 because it's a much thinner and
lighter device so I I don't know how how
have you felt so far after using it
compared to your experience with a 920
you know it's funny uh my girlfriend
prefers the 928 like crazy style wise
aesthetically and I get it and I can
appreciate a squared off rounded design
but it's different a squared off non
rounded design but the thing is yes it's
a little bit lighter it's almost
indiscernibly lighter though and the
sacrifices you make are in the in the
back cover here which once again here's
my crappy webcam but you can't really
see this this uh speaker grill you know
which I would let sheep it does it looks
cheaper it feels cheaper um it doesn't
feel I'm not gonna say it feels cheap
I'm gonna say it feels cheaper than the
920 and that's a step backward I would
prefer they not have taken yeah
thatthat's figure rose very badly design
it's like a big blow on the face to the
920 which we had them very smartly place
right along the edge here exact that was
much smarter I should have the 920 in
the booth and I don't I want to get to
because he was here I think it was our
first guest today I want to I want to
ask Kevin yen to turn on his microphone
and say hello Kevin guinea wrath yes he
can but we can hear you've got a mute
button in the upper right of your screen
if you would toggle that off and no lo
dice no dice Kevin uh stick around yeah
yeah somebody somebody's very helpfully
turning this week is it's a red button
in the upper right hand side of your
screen can you turn that off going one
yeah going are having some technical
problems at Kevin stick around a
gentleman at the left yeah
yeah when you figure that out when you
figure that out please unmute yourself
and say hello but in the interim let's
say hello to the helpful Zach slam
messing I'm got that kinda right that's
the worst mispronunciation I've ever
heard it schmoozing well there is there
oh there's an I yes there's a dot over
there if you listen to talking at weekly
i mispronounced names all the time the
top yeah I I have all the episodes on my
I my trusted all ipod nano right here
we'd oh it's good to have a dedicated
listener Thank You Zach welcome to the
you review thank you um this is my first
time being on any of these live hangout
so I'm really excited that's awesome I
do you're our second number one number
one guest in the in a row thank you all
right were you were you calling from um
I'm calling from Folsom California it's
near Sacramento nice outstanding i was
in sacramento last year for my brother's
wedding I likes nice place but is hot in
the summer it is hot in the summer
what's hot in Boston in the summer too
probably not as how does it gets out
there under only five degrees under
yeah I think you gotta speed you got a
speedo hi may may have us both feet high
me how does it get down there in the
summer 110-120 sometimes that's what a
lot yeah and I'm talking 1 100 at 7am
yeah that's gross that's when you go
running to know I go running it fine
because of that no yeah I follow you on
Instagram and I see you're all your post
about the running Jaime oh nice thank
you I'm it does take some pretty good
running shots exactly are you are you
calling in about the the Xperia tablet Z
the Lumia 928 or both um a little bit of
both I think first um what is it much of
an upgrade I've got my iPad jus right
here is it too much is it much of not
greater sure to just keep with this
until they stop supporting it so we just
know I'm gonna ask him his opinion on
this too but we just aired a ipad vs
galaxy if I've had Versailles but Xperia
tablet Z ok so but you the ipad 2 so you
have the lighter but older one yeah it
is like is slightly thinner and lighter
which makes it helpful yeah now i don't
i know our own go ahead I'm
it's not only thinner and lighter the
weight distribution of the ipad 2 yes
but for me the iPad 3 was a desperate
move into just bumping you know just
raising the bar for competition but the
ipad 2 seems to be like something that
was well thought out its thinnest i
padded thinnest ipad it's thinner than
the three than the four and then the one
and it's not thinner than the meaning no
no it's not thinner than the minute now
it means a movie it's not that in the
mini but but still I think that you know
the problem with the ipad 2 is that your
resale values at the floor right now if
you yeah that's what I'm just keeping it
yeah if you try to sell it right now
you'll definitely get more money now
than later on ebay and probably use that
money to buy another tablet but other
than that I mean it's a good tablet it's
it's it's a trustee tablet it's a
workhorse I I feel that it's a good
product so far yeah I mean don't you
feel like now would be the best time for
Zach to to like to actually unload the
ipad 2 on someone else because I feel
like WWDC even if it doesn't have a tab
on announcements probably won't it's
still gonna affect the resale value of
it somewhat am I totally off base there
was this thing wrong exact the problem
is is its launch another sorry you can
finish okay fine i was gonna say this
thing will probably support iOS 7 if
that comes out at WWDC because odds are
still selling it right now and then
Rock'em come out with a new ipad most
likely right oh um thing is I OS 7
there's different degrees of support
right especially when you talk about
Apple like I mean my initial iPad I
remember like to two generations in or
it was the ipod touch actually and all
of a sudden I I'm running the latest
software and every app is crashing all
the time and this is why I don't pay
crashes on here yet it's still pretty
good that's your advantage your
advantage is that you're holding an ipad
mini with a larger size basically yes
they're gonna continue supporting the
ipad 2 for a while um the thing is this
if you try to sell that tablet right now
and no tablet gets announced at WWDC
you're gonna have to buy an old a
current generation ipad because you just
don't want to be left out without a
tablet ya know i would recommend
for you to wait for it to be announced
and most likely Apple usually announces
something right now and then gives you
you know usually 10 to 15 days for them
to actually start three orders of the
plot the next product that they do
announce it so most likely you know here
you know June tenth that's when the
event happens watch it if you see that
thing announced a new tablet then put
that thing on sale then also how much
sure is good to go ahead although I have
a question for you when you're finished
okay how much lighter is the tablet Z
then the ipad 2 so what's the what's the
weight on the ipad too high man Oh get
that to you right now hold on 13.3 three
pounds for the Wi-Fi model and what is
that in grams I mammogram I'm am a
stinker I have no idea we try to get you
I think they're gonna be pretty
comparable to be honest with you cuz
this is 495 grams which is somewhere on
rid of uh oh hey it's half a kilo that's
like 1.2 pounds so that is 607 grams 607
grams for the ipad 2 okay yeah okay so
this is substantially lighter and like I
was doing before I mean you can it is so
easy to prop it up thusly and n-type
like this I could do this all day long
so you're gonna get a little bit of a
you know a weight bonus on this that's
what you have the smart cover for tybee
yeah if you want to prop it up but I
don't know I do a lot of this kind of
stuff I do a lot of one-handed use a lot
a lot you know what I mean but what
about knows like what I mean are you
like a it with the water resistance of
this tablet offer any love that i mean i
play Angry Birds in the hot tub okay no
no no but you're you're absolutely right
so so the question for you is going to
be is going to be do those do those
advantages of water resistance and
lighter weight overcome the deficiencies
of the android tablet app ecosystem
which as you know is less robust yeah
god I've got this rooted Kindle Fire
here with apps is basically a nexus 7
except it doesn't have a camera has a
dual core processor at one point two
gigahertz and it only has half a gig of
ram but anyway I have noticed there's
not that much app support here sorry my
phone ringing oh no problem no problem
no that's uh you know you're right i
mean the apps are the
there there are hundreds of thousands of
them but the problem is that they don't
scale well to the larger display and
listen yeah I didn't know but you know
we may see we may see that problem
correct itself as as Google puts a lot
more effort into correcting it but as of
now you're still not be suffering with
that if you go to the tablet Z now yes
remix what does that happen one question
what's the PPI on that tablet Z 0 264 or
229 that's like twice what this is yeah
that's twice yeah it's out now another
question how are the viewing angles
because my xperia ZL is a huge
disappointment right so we were looking
at this in at mwc and it's it once again
it's very tough to illustrate with my
webcam but you can actually see it's
actually not too difficult to illustrate
you can see how quickly it falls off as
you as you get away from center of
course you can double tap to bring it
back which is a which is a very nice
touch but that it that is somewhat
exaggerated i have found I found that on
a video camera this polarization effect
is much more pronounced in real life you
can still watch you know a movie from
the side like this it's it is
significantly dimmer but it's still
clear so I think it's a little out of
proportion and so no Sony's Mobile
BRAVIA Engine really helps to to comfort
that here's the demonstration with the
ipad 2 it's really pretty darn good
viewing angles them had a reflection in
my face and like you know that's that's
especially interesting considering
that's not a laminated display you know
that's that's like what a half a
millimeter under the glass there so when
I be yeah so when Apple brings that that
surface laminated display technology to
to the next generation hopefully that's
only going to improve though that yeah
that's it no one looking Michael about
that you know the tablet Z I'm truck the
problem with the xperia phone lineup is
really that colors wash out when you
look at a man do you have that problem
or colors remain accurate colors don't
don't stay accurate but they don't wash
out to the grade agree that the phones
do and I do wonder how much that screen
protector has to do with it that kind of
means i took the screen protector off
and then I wasn't that bad for
scratching the screen protector being
off
good question scratch it no no scratches
at all I mean you get yeah I'm sure that
you can I'm just oh I'm sure that you
can easily the other problem is it seems
that the adhesive doesn't completely get
removed from the display so it's very
easy to smudge this display in
comparison to any other display that I'm
yeah exactly I do want to say what sorry
dude sorry I'm just keeping an eye on
the clock there is no sort of coating on
this phone and you know I remove it just
to make to see if it was a screen
protector issue and no it's a display
problem Zack I know that I know we
didn't get a chance to talk much about
the 928 we do have to move on a little
bit i want to ask you before before I
ask you if you have any more questions
the Xperia tablet Z and your opinion
thumbs up thumbs down thumbs up two
thumbs up that's a really good tablet
I've seen your videos about it you're
not well one thing is I'm pretty
impressed on how quickly you can churn
out those videos what was it like a week
that's when you're unboxing your review
and yeah yeah and you know um a large
part of that zach is we have we have up
we have a large support system here at
paga Knox we were all able to help each
other out and it's it's very nice to
have that to lean on so yeah it's off
running a small tech thing as you see my

having me hey that's that's awesome keep
at it everybody visit table top tech if
you get a chance i will take a spin by
there as soon as we're done with the
your review thanks again Zack why don't
you thanks so much okay bye-bye that was
fun alright so we got we're keeping the
scorecard around we're remembering at
least once in a while to tell people to
share where they can be found on the
internet so that's a good thing and it
looks like Kevin may have solved his
audio problem i am i guessing that right
yeah yes outside on switched on to my
phone Oh the problem was on it was on a
computer was it ah well uh we're glad
the mobile devices have have come to the
rescue Kevin where you're calling from
and welcome to you review i'm calling
from Oklahoma Oh what part of Oklahoma
game um around Oklahoma City Central I'm
glad you uh I'm glad your your house is
still standing I presume yeah it was
around 2530 minutes away ah ah well yeah
I was actually around like two weeks of
constant storms yeah and Aaron's going
on yeah for those who have not watched
the news in the past month Oklahoma has
just been getting destroyed by tornadoes
so really glad that that Kevin you're
still with us and I've got a I've got a
college buddy in Oklahoma but anyway
we're uh we're talking talking mobile
devices and your seem to still be with
you are you calling it about the Xperia
tablet Z or the Lumia 928 on the tablet
Z 0 seems like a really good tablet I've
been keeping up with it when it first
sight was introduced I'm glad I could
see a review from you guys cuz I love
your YouTube channel on the website well
it's awesome to know that someone is uh
is watching the watching the reviews and
particularly reading the review on the
tablet Z as we open up the show we told
you that the comment traffic
on that has been a little bit low but
what are you considering buying the
tablet Z do you have a question we
didn't cover in the review is there
something i would get a miller android
tablet like i have the motorola xoom
still i my my my family um they have the
ipad like the ipad 3rd generation and i
have an android tablet okay say are you
the are you that you're the contrarian
in the family then yeah good for you
yeah i thought i still had this thing
here here it is i mean i was gonna ask
if you still have the zoom wow wow can
we do it on the air on the air thickness
comparison right now yeah yeah alright
Zane seriously oh the zoom how is it
working for you Kevin is it is it
something mattered right I use it
sometimes but not that much anymore like
I used to before I got a high-end
smartphone what is your hands much fun
well I'm you have an s3 right now I'm
planning on getting the one soon 9s
spoke great devices that's that's
awesome so I in terms of that though
which one you're buying first you're
gonna be big or tablet shopping first
because I feel like I feel like this has
got to be ranking somewhere in your
consideration if you already have an
android tablet right yeah yeah since I
already have a pretty like pretty
high-end smartphone even for a year old
I think I'll go of the tablet z yeah now
it what I mean is there is there
competition are you considering other
devices and what can we tell you about
the z that uh that you don't know
already yeah like uh like tablet wise
i'm interested in like um getting a
nexus 7 or 10 or waiting for like a new
one if it does come out soon like in the
fall yeah we're good now Jaime we've
been talking about that as i recall we
had some some discussion on the the new
Nexus 7 class product didn't we yeah
yeah it's
kind of it's kind of a tough call right
now I don't you know I you know the
tablet Z comes out you know the tablet Z
would have come out a couple of months
earlier it would have had a better head
start some people are waiting you know
nothing was released at Google i/o and I
think that a lot of people have been
having second thoughts about the tablet
Z because they thought that they would
see another nexus in Google i/o so I
don't know it's it's it's kind of a
tough call i feel that the tablet z is a
product that could stand on its own
meaning that you aren't buying a good
product if you're interested in an
Android tablet when compared to a nexus
you know it's not like if you're getting
a better product with the Nexus just
because it's a nexus product i think
that the tablets he has a lot of things
that are that are great like the
waterproof like the waterproof system to
get display etc etc so i don't know it's
a tough call to know if you should wait
for nexus 7 if it could be until the
fall until we get that product you
should wear and you know and what we're
talking nexus stuff is important to note
that the the tablet z supports the the
AOSP a sony has added it to the android
open source project so you know it's
it's only a matter of time as i
understand things i'm not a routing guy
but as I understand things it's only a
matter time we're going to see a really
solid stock Android build on this tablet
if you don't like Sony's skin already
you know and so many skin imparts a
little bit of lag and I understand why
you would want to run a google edition
you know stock build of Android but you
know if that is your if the if that is
your direction if that's what you want
and you want to a very very thin very
portable tablet that I was also
waterproof as long as you're okay with
charging it once every day or so or once
every day and a half you know you should
really be considering it because the
battery is quite small yeah so is the
battery like all night just normal use
yeah so the battery you know what did i
do i did the weekend test with like
light to moderate use for you yeah I did
browsing at night during the day or
resume I could use that lightly and I
even though it's pretty old now like
lightly I can still last like two days
or a little bit more you know what the
power rating on that battery is
I don't remember likes it was a pretty
big one for you hon hai Medina it's been
a while ah yeah I don't know it's uh oh
you were typing I was like wet it was
audios driving up yeah no I mean here's
the thing you know it's so very
difficult to say it's also difficult for
me to focus because i keep getting like
are you getting that audio sound what is
that stupid audio cue mean i had i think
it's it's the hangouts thing it's it's
really dumb i believe that it's it's got
like seven thousand milliamp hours
combined in the tool in the two cells
that it has what on the zoom yeah really
so that's only beating this by a
thousand milliamp hours but Kevin you
say that you can it'll last you like you
might use like just browsing have a
couple yeah you're growing a much the
resolution on the displace much much
it's much lower yeah yeah and what kind
of processors are running on again oh
god it was a dual core yeah it's good
this tool car it's not the s4 pro z will
get more processor for Android I'm just
trying to remember right so all that
kind of stuff it's all right it doesn't
matter what it is so yeah these are the
differences you're working with the
thing is I'm not trying to gain say that
the endurance on the Xperia tablet Z it
lasts very long for a spin a tablet it
is it's just not like something like
it's not nowhere near some like the iPad
of the ipad 2 or what's an or the nexus
10 which has like a 9000 milliamp hour
battery and also dual core processor but
it has a display but the tenor last long
time this won't last quite as long so
it's something to think that too I want
to prompt you for some final thoughts
Kevin before I take you have anything
else no that was a sec so that was a
Tegra 2 there was a Tegra 2 in the zoom
on the zoom yeah that was a Tegra 2 Wow
well I Kevin you're probably going to be
the most qualified person to ask as far
as scoring goes because you're actually
in the market right now for the Xperia
tablet Z if you had to say yes or no to
it right now would you give it a thumbs
up or thumbs down yeah
get that thumbs up thumbs up for the
tablet see that's awesome will you let
us know Kevin we've got a mailbox here
we've got you review at pocketnow.com
shoot us an email let us know which way
you decide to go okay and before you
bail out right now tell people where
they can find you on the Internet if
that is something you want to share um
you can find me on Twitter at UM at Y a
B oh I k evo sounds good and that's
gonna be on the broadcast and that's
where you can reach Kevin Kevin thank
you for joining us today alright thank
you alright see ya bye bye hi may I
believe it has come time for you to
select the next guest right now in case
anyone is wondering about halfway
through the show we're working with
three thumbs ups for the Xperia tablet Z
no thumbs downs the Lumia 928 has only
one middle of the hand thumb fascinating
good I've obviously met hi Otto in the
past in the past hangouts I just
wondered man are you running out of fuel
in that car engine turns off engine turn
a/c cranking all right now let's let's
get you out of there ah all right then
that I missing doing the Hangout his
works been getting away I was just gonna
ask that now hi Otto is that a welcome
to the you review by the way is that a
tmobile shirt you have honors that's
something else because he looks like
you're on lunch break from t-mobile
right now yes I am yes oh that is
awesome I'm a good choice i'm glad we
got iata on before his lunch break is
fired how is very briefly how is life in
in the mobile retail world since I left
it five years ago they're good it's um
we get a lot of new phones lately and I
think we've been another one here soon
least a couple so yes bad Nicholas hi
Otto has the distinction viewers of
beating us to the punch on the
blackberry q10 because because it works
for you mobile so congratulations on
that I love the photo you posted earlier
this week
thank you you know I guess hey I'm
actually uh I've never been a fan of
physical keyboards um or blackberry for
that matter but I I do like the q10 I am
I wouldn't you I'm hoping that you get
to spend some extended time with her
because I would like to hear your
thoughts on that I want to I want to
keep us on track because I have to be a
martinet here because I am so easily
distracted uh hi May why don't you uh
why don't you ask our friend I ought to
weather is here for the phone or the
tablet yeah it's a good question i mean
you your in T bowl so that's that's kind
of a tough question i mean what are you
are you considering any of the either
products the tablet Z or the Lumia 928
you know um and what we're getting the
experience Z phone here soon oh are you
guys gonna get the tablet I thought I
saw some rumor that the tablet Z with
t-mobile LTE bands had maybe landed I
haven't I haven't heard about the tablet
coming at mobile but I mean I figure the
phone pretty much the same more or less
right and I question is are you
interested in the tablet does it call
your eye or with me I right now I don't
remember I have that nexus 10 actually
uh you're rocking within the nexus 10
there so the thicker front firing
speakers equipped Google sourced tablet
is that that's not what you're calling
it from right now right you're you're
from a phone right now yeah I'm just
calling on my one yeah wow yeah there's
that wide angle camera lens yeah I
understand so like I I thought the other
day I was like well t-mobile LTE bands
if this thing had a cellular radio in it
it would be even more attractive to me
because of its extreme portability now
I've handled the nexus 10 i love the
stick back i love that it's it's thick
and you know it's kind of substantial i
love that almost 10,000 milliamp hour
battery but this this calls to me are
you a portability guy either like i mean
you'd you need to be able to move around
very quickly with something like this
where you can just kind of throw it
around like a frisbee or do you not care
about that no I definitely like that I
mean that that's actually why I've been
considering I've had many over my Nexus
and um that that and uh you know then
android tablets just don't have a good
ecosystem perhaps yeah ought to say I
mean that that's an interesting ditch
moving from a nexus 10 to an ipad mini
you've got such a beautiful resolution
display on the Nexus 10 and then nothing
escapes me really it's like what people
are complaining all the time it's like
oh man this is the best display on a
tablet but it's pointless if everything
looks choppy on it right axel but it and
I do want to make the point that it is
not it is not necessarily pointless if
you're willing to make that sacrifice
and you have a big investment in
Google's ecosystem because Google's
native apps tend to look quite good for
the most part on Android tablets and
also the content consumption you know
Netflix is Netflix no matter what you're
running it on I mean like that's awesome
amazon it has a great version for
everything so if you're not you know if
you're not jumping into a smartphone
version of twitter all the time if
you're not jumping into spotify all the
time well that's that's a big downside
right so yeah it's it's it's a
compromise as always would you add to a
few carried this thing would you would
you consider buying it as an employee or
as a customer uh you know what yeah I
mean I the experience at Lizzie has
excuse me has a lot of things that I
really like about it I mean like like
you said it's light and portable and I
definitely like that and I'm a big fan
of the fact that it's waterproof come
because Aussie I tend to attend a listen
to the out weekly well I'm
taking a shower before work don't we all
welcome welcome to the welcome to the
pocket now share all that's that's
hilarious that's awesome so yeah now
what one question hi Otto I mean just I
held the Nexus the nexus 10 and I used
it for a week um feel that the tablet is
big and heavy I don't know what is it
what it is about the build in this
tablet but it feels light because of the
plastic specifically so do you really
feel that you would change that nexus 10
for a tablet Z
I'm not sure that I would that I would
trade it for of the tablet Z I might
just because of the water resistance and
that's that's a huge plus sign to me
because I'm always uh you know I I like
your own brown liquid yeah I don't
always feel liquids on my tablets but I
mean you know it I would rather have the
the protection in case I do that's
that's how I feel and even if I think I
would feel that way even if I didn't
spend a lot of the time on the on the
water iata we've got it we've got to
move on I'm sorry I've got to keep a
pretty tight schedule here but I want to
ask and I think I know the answer but I
really want to ask tablet Z from you
thumbs up thumbs down I give a thumbs up
um nice yeah i mean i've seen clash
about the laagi software but i'm sure
you could avoid that with with either a
custom rom or just not using sony
widgets so i'd give it up that's exactly
right now we'll look forward to hearing
if if t-mobile carries it and what your
how your opinions change or become
reinforced once you get a demo unit in
your hands but in the interim I think
this is the first time I this is
certainly the first time I the you
review it might be a first time for the
live unless you've done this before for
someone's joined us from a car which is
awesome thank you please join us from
the bathroom that's good I was just
gonna say i was just gonna say never
never join us from the bathroom never
join us from the shower but you know
enjoy your showers all the same yeah
probable personal but about the car that
this works I'm just really sweaty right
now alright hopefully the malls are the
stories air conditioning is still
working well and we'll see on the next
one yeah yeah um I'm looking forward to
getting the 925 also in t-mobile cuz I
figure that's probably the very similar
to the 928 so yeah with you no problem
yeah but will remember the 925 has that
as an extra sixth element in the camera
it lacks the the Xenon flash
of the 928 and hopefully you know I
really hope that the compromises the 928
has made are not mirrored exactly in the
925 because this this between the
speaker the voice quality a time just
like it's not a bad phone but it's not
as good as the 920 in those respects all
right so i have to thank you very much
well good job thanks all right you find
me on twitter at dredge dro a GE or uh
just you can see my website droid in
mobile com but i haven't really touched
that about a month so I mean get some
month all articles that's it sounds good
man well we'll see on the next one and
uh and thank you for joining us take
care all right thanks nice see ya well I
am a question for you I mean I have the
impression that you're the guy that
would never touch the flash on a camera
if you didn't have to yeah yeah you're
absolutely not flash a big plus for you
on the Lumia 928 so it's not a big plus
it's not a big plus for me but that is
because frankly I'm not really skilled
enough to use it i'll see if i can fire
off the the Xenon flash here now if
you're skilled or if you're even just
marginally capable BAM there that goes
um you can use the flesh to great effect
in night scenes by you know but you to
illuminate your your foreground subject
while keeping the background exposed at
nice levels using I think it's night
portrait is the mode but at tonys really
good at it on the 808 but the thing is
there's a great example when you're in
ultra low light like I closed the door
here in the booth and it was basically
pitch dark and I challenged the Nokia
Lumia 920 to a flash shot and that LED
spotlight while powerful was not
powerful enough to give the camera
enough time to get focused before it
snapped the shot so the result was a
very blurry shot and the 928 snapped it
very clearly Oh interesting yeah so
there's that advantage and there are
others that frankly are beyond me
because if I if you're carrying a Lumia
product if say what you will about
windows
about nokia about whatever i cannot find
a better low-light performer in
smartphones than these devices with
using standard settings including the
HTC One so I rarely have used for the
flash so I think the Xenon flash is a
bit of a I don't want to say it you're
right it's nice to have it's nice to
have if you're more capable than I am at
shooting smartphones we do you ever use
the flash uh well on the iphone 5 you
can get some really good shots at night
with the flash I don't know why it is
but really if you have the flat so
usually i'm not a flash type of guy i
really don't like to use it but at night
it feels like if you're using a point
and shoot the resulting photos feel like
a point shoot mmm i don't know why but
it just balances the color really well
with the flash and I think that's mostly
the problem with usually with
smartphones they they don't know how to
really handle the flash to balance
everything out and I feel that the
iphone is the one that dunce does it
best but obviously I haven't really seen
the 928 you know in the type of action
that I've used the iphone fire for right
yeah and you know i mean the 928 I've
been poking around with and taking some
shots and I hope uh let me ask it it
folks who are joining us who are still
in the ribbon down below if you've got a
question or a comment about the 928
we've been talking a lot about the Sony
Xperia tablet Z if you've got a question
or comment about the 928 you want to
dress make make yourself visible will
you raise your hand will you dance
around or do something Aereo and 0
karthik i think is car pick is a big
lumia guy yeah yeah oh very nice is that
a 920 or 909 20 nice i just couldn't see
it i was very very brief he should see
this one one sec see what you got no
check this play oh geez ouch how that
happened farthing well I was jogging and
I want to see how much I how much
distance I could I
covered I took it out and it fell flat
on top have to display on on the app but
it'll tell you how you're going i was
using runtastic and i had to see how
many mind says whatever uh did you are
there any nokia what do they call them
nokia care points in your room will give
it replacing myself because i had an
xperia x10 which is completely gone but
I tried Xperia mean I literally
experimented I was able to remove the
glass front facing class so I bought a
replacement I'm gonna do that myself
hopefully it will work out wow I was
taking a piss play on that phone is not
easy no yeah hopefully the guy it's the
first portion of the phone that you pull
out that's the cool thing the suction
yeah we were so worried you just attach
a suction cup to the to the disco and
you're gonna use a hairdryer of
something to hear I it but that's yes
the first portion that comes out you
pull out the SIM tray and then after you
pull out the SIM tray you you pry it
from the from the edges and then you
pull it out with suction cup I feel like
I feel like somebody's telling me about
their trip to the dentist like this just
hurts no oh well that's that's awesome
Carly good are you uh are you guys gonna
see the 928 over the I don't think so
right this is still gonna be a verizon
exclusive for a while yeah yeah but the
question I had was you use both of them
right you you've been using 920 for a
while yeah and n 20 you just took it
whatever but what do you think the form
factor is because i love the form factor
of 9 20 the way it fits in the hand here
and 928 it's little more square I
actually make a difference yes it does
yeah I mean have you seen the every
singer comparison the 920 versus not
here yeah so like it if if there were a
list of things that were this device
differed from the 920 that would the
design would be at the top of it I mean
this thing is so incredibly boxy in and
of itself you put an X to the 920 and
while it's not immediately apparent you
get it in your hand and it's like wow
you know how the 920 when you hold it
like this that that corner
yeah that in many flip you off Justin
but yeah like the corner digs into your
palm the 928 does it about three times
worse it is just a device yeah it's on
as well as the Lumia 900 I will say that
the Lumia 900 is the one that gave me
the blister yeah you really did this hey
a buster yeah so um so yeah it is it is
fundamentally different and and this the
nokia smile is completely gone yeah
that's what I hate yeah I'm dad it's a
lot i do too frankly i think that was
one thing now we can't expect no cater
just stand still we can't expect them
not to evolve the design i get it but I
don't know if boxy is is the way the way
to go here a minute okay so it's all
something Michael am I the only guy that
actually likes that phone no no again
that's what I was just let us say I want
it I do like it I just don't like it as
much as I like the 920 okay so do me a
favor do me a favor where's your trash
can it's right there you just throw it
there and then you had a shipping label
to address very soon you know it's funny
I'm I owed my objection usually when I
may ask me for a phone is to be like hi
Mia won't work in your country don't
worry about it I popped a AT&amp;amp;T sim Yanni
it's unlocked yeah it's unlocked out of
the box yeah all LTE phones from verizon
by law have to be unlocked what they
have real gsm capabilities you can make
any verizon phone Lettie current verizon
phone from this year from last year on
yeah AT&amp;amp;T right yeah but I'm it you have
to deal with that big ol verizon
branding on the on the unit up the bride
and we're ones up for hugs I've got this
polished specific paint that I use for
my car oh really oh you think I'll take
it right off of there this is so car
they just check out this top bezel I
hate that I'm here today I known it on
the 920 you know you've got that dub
death you've got the bottom bezel but
not that top one that forehead is just
go on what is complaining about a top
bezel this is the worst top bezel in
history no bacon one that AT&amp;amp;T logo oh
yeah seeing the AT&amp;amp;T logo is diminutive
compared to the verizon check that's why
i bought the replacement i bought one
without it oh nice oh that is nice see I
don't even III talked to nokia care us
on Twitter recently about the dust in my
920 front facing camera and because we
don't have any nokia care points in the
US and they were like I gotta mail it to
Fort Worth Texas and have it replaced
funny that's the same way to ship HTC
phones that's interesting ya think
there's a lot of stuff I'm gonna I want
to pay a visit to Fort Worth I'm right
next to it are you even yeah because I'm
from India yes but I'm doing my graduate
studies here in ut you da oh really I
mean Arlington actually right next to
cover stadium Oh your flag through me I
thought you were you were calling
internationally oh no I'm sleeping at
this time if I was in India I know well
you know some people stay up late and
they you know they hang out late with us
Carly before we before we move on thank
you for asking about the 928 first one
more question though please hit me when
you when you have 920 right if you shake
it feels like there's something loose
inside but there's nothing do you feel
the same thing with the 928 now the 928
is is is solid in that respect and we
have to give it its to perhaps there it
is lighter it is a tad thinner but you
know it's I never had that rattling
problem with my 920 I don't think I mean
some people like the battery was loose
it wasn't the OIS module it was the best
I I have two friends were the same 920
and they also have the same thing so I
was like is there something wrong with
the phone yeah I seem to recall that was
some kind of batch issue with with a
particular batch of Lumias I'm just
talking out of my mom out here so I
don't know i might be wrong on that but
no the 928 that i have the demo unit
here does not it is solid i mean you're
you're hearing your hearing all the
rattling there is and there's none so
okay yeah trash can you should car thik
thank you for coming on the air with us
tell people where they can reach you and
before you go your thumbs up or thumbs
down Oh 928 all right thumbs up in some
ways because of the weight otherwise I
loved 920 design so it's I don't know or
all maybe
like this not completely but like sixty
seventy percent somebody somebody beats
you to the punch on the on the one
middle thumb so okay then thumbs up I
guess thumbs are worse because there are
there on verizon and Xperia Z thumbs up
because I have aces 101 with the first
generation tablet oh very nice and as it
what is that running for that too yeah
it's hopeful for point-to-point oh yeah
I was a clock widget is stock isn't yeah
that's awesome huh because any time it
has to be rooted anyway okay Karthik
tell it could what is that does he spell
it spell your Twitter handle for us
because we're low res uh it's k udupa
that's it it's awesome garlic thank you
very much for joining us and we'll look
forward to seeing you on the next one
sure tomorrow awesome all right thank
you very much thank you yeah man I would
die if I would smash the display on a
Lumia 920 Michael seriously seriously
and you know what I mean I should have
broken minor ready you know how many
time I've dropped the 920 on its face
and I don't mean like on carpet like in
a parking lot on concrete and my 920 is
still soldiering on so no way well just
you know just cross your fingers because
like the the the only crack display that
I've ever had is the Galaxy Nexus and
the reason why wait you have my other
galaxy nexus of the reason why is
because Brandon had already dropped it
so much that whatever you chip the
display even if it doesn't break
immediately that second fall regardless
of how big or small it is it'll crack it
yes I did that on my fear you ever have
that you ever have that situation where
you your anybody and you guys know what
I'm talking about where you've got the
phone in your hand and you're doing
whatever but your your trip or whatever
for some reason the phone starts you
start to lose it and you go for the grab
to save it and what it ends up doing is
like catapulting it into the
stratosphere no tell me have you ever
done this have you ever tried to save a
phone by putting your foot between the
you know between the phone and the floor
and it ends up shipping all the way
does it land on that angled top part of
your foot is like Queen yeah yeah just
completely strips that happens if I 1x
you know who you know who you can't have
a conversation with this about Tony
Anton according to Anthony's never
dropped a phone in his life anyway we
were talking about it on the weekly
today listen to it this morning let's
talk to to another guest and let's see
if let's see if if one has ever dropped
a phone one welcome to the you review
can you unmute your mic and say hello
it's me yes yes welcome aboard are you
refers to first of all next to speak to
you and greetings from Dominican
Republic yeah very nice to speak to you
as well and greetings from the United
States and I and I have to say that the
reason that I listen to you guys is
because you are multinational because it
yeah because it when you listen to
podcast you only you only listen to the
American that the American situated
right and with Jaime Jaime can tell you
how this internet that America and the
Tony they tell you how teens are in
Europe for example here we don't have
black berry spitting plans it's really
hard get a nice phone yeah we got you
leaving to 200 bucks and you got a
really nice fun you know if I if I don't
want I have to pay that I don't know
like a thousand dollars exactly yeah
yeah I want to go to galaxy s4 Oh cost
you a thousand two hundred dollars yeah
yeah yeah oh that is that is why I need
you because you were a global know right
now man you know that's that's awesome
to hear of one because we don't you know
it's very easy to forget that it really
is i mean it's it's it's just uh it's
it's so nice to hear that that people
listen to us for for the fact that we
have a pretty diverse team yeah yeah
it's for anything my man weakly again is
what you're saying hi Mei is overdue for
a weekly laughs again ah well um what
happened many question but I will tell
you one um why I may I have an iPad to
write and I have like um are we r &amp;amp;
why buy android toggle head table when
you can buy the new land windows phone
table it's a whether I like that on the
table tab there are like really
computers for example I have an
afternoon a new night Wayne and I have
another noon got some windows from the
iphone but I had yeah but why buy a
table I have an iPad I don't use it I
really for new for the newspaper in the
morning but dice is that I use my
computer and if I got a computer like
for example the acer 3w that is high if
we agree w right why buy an android
tablet that you can only use angry if
you can buy the real computer that you
can use everything windows a full power
it yeah you can no use photoshop but who
will use photoshop in a table right so
it's it's a good idea it's a good
question to bring up in the context of
the you review because we've got we have
a really good example of an Android
tablet here in the Xperia Z which
compelling hardware that is running
software that is not as capable in terms
of raw power as something like Windows
the answer for me one and I will I will
just answer first and let hi may go for
it is that is that yes running a mobile
OS and a tablet form factor it is more
limiting but sometimes that's all I need
and I'm not willing to make the
sacrifices that a I'm not always willing
to make the sacrifices that are demanded
by a more fully featured OS I don't want
a fan in my tablet necessarily and I
also don't want if I use like the HP
Envy x2 which I was formerly in love
with and now I am NOT you know I'm not
willing to make the performance
sacrifices that that the that they that
it demands often so it you know it's a
question of the right tool for the right
job often for me hi Mei how would you
answer the question I was going to ask
you how much did that Envy x2 cost it
was like 600 bucks or 500 bucks or
something step but it's windows 8 right
what was the processor on that thing
it's the full version of Windows 8 and
it's an atom processor I don't know the
spec
okay so here's the problem or a clever
trailer yeah yeah what okay so if you
can buy a surface pro answering your
question one comes yeah and by a surface
pro then it isn't worth it instead of
buying a lesser tablet to go for a much
more capable tablet because the surface
pro is a more capable tablet yeah yeah
the problem is that an intel atom tablet
is not necessarily a more capable tablet
it can run everything that when those
times when those computers can run the
question is how well can you run them I
mean how well can it run photoshop for
example yeah yeah but that is detecting
my point I have a computer powerful
computers esta come to the right so when
I use a table I don't use photoshop i
really don't use I use it for like
everybody I everybody that has a table
at Abba tape I don't know how to say
that it's a tablet tablet everybody I
have a tablet like I use in probably
know you really prohibiting so besides i
wish i did a sustained now there are
creepy speakers you don't use it for
music your home not to use headphones so
you use it for like watching movies yeah
m and reading the newspaper that in
emails so you know i can perfectly do
that in a windows 8 table i will not
rule photoshop so i will not do anything
hard-working so why so one I want to ask
you if because it's because we are kind
of keeping our focus on the devices that
are in the title it do you have
something specific that you have a
question ask about about about this
particular tablet the young another
table I see the review is being it's
waterproof is beautiful and but it's not
compelling to you though yeah because i
enjoy i like android but i won't then I
will have to pay that no half a thousand
donors for that for the table so this
valley did you say like after that this
would be how much would you tell this
yeah you have it great you would pay
eight hundred dollars here for that yeah
i'll have to pay a hundred to a hundred
dollars so for you guys it will be that
cheaper but for me it's really expensive
and i have to i have think well the
iphone i I don't like the iphone I
have all the iphones where I really
don't like it right now but the iOS is
like the most complete ecosystem so why
why I'm commit myself to buy this real
expensive device beautiful nevertheless
but really expensive if I for less money
can buy this one I know they will have
all application we have all the game so
yeah I don't know you're making a
compelling point you're making a very
very compelling point you know I think
that the launch so you're saying that if
Sony would come up with a bio tablet Z
you know a full windows 8 vaio on the
design of that experience a blitz Z that
you would like it you would prefer i I
don't know i don't think so because i
don't know like it though so you're
saying that you if it ran windows 8
that's what you're saying right you
would love that beautiful design right I
don't know because I it is a really good
question because in my experience when I
came home I don't I don't pick the table
at the I would say a table a table it's
all right I don't think I don't make it
I think this is really bad I never end
TV and watching movies over your English
is nothing wrong with your Englishman it
sounds great so are they all right and
so when I came home I really don't use
it I use my pc and I met you guys do the
same like we know that needs to be the
case for me I mean I used to be in the
same boat and yeah when I still want to
do something fast and efficiently then
absolutely yes i will i will go for the
for the macbook here but you know I i do
use tablets for a lot of consumption
these days especially tablets that are
exceedingly portable and very
lightweight and you know my ipad is more
capable for a lot of the things i do
then the tablet Z but I will still pick
this and I'll suffer through it just
because it is so so light now if it cost
me eight hundred nine hundred dollars no
no I would not do that and that is a
situation at the American yeah and
that's the thing I mean Juan Carlos and
I live a specific issue so I I I went
crazy with the nexus 7 came to market
and the reason why is because man if
somebody mugged me with this
two-hundred-dollar tablet I would
fine right you know I'd be like okay
fine you know it's a two-hundred-dollar
tablet like we say in Spanish me more
but you know I I was carrying a nine
hundred dollar ipad 3 the 64 gig LT
variant so you know of course I wouldn't
want to be mug with a nine hundred
dollar I know that's the reason I feel
that the tablet Z is a beautiful product
yes i agree with one Carlos but the
problem is that for the price tag it
doesn't compare to the scale of an NB x2
that you have there and they're priced
similarly I guess that's the point yeah
and that is a real thing in America I
have an iphone 4 when I buy it was like
a thousand dollars I was afraid to get
in industry I was afraid so you guys
don't have that I don't know how to know
how the planner they're good yes really
expensive i will i don't know i will
make the point here that that on the
pocket now team the American pocket now
a team most of us here are pretty
fortunate to live in in cities where
that's that's not necessarily a problem
there's plenty of cities in America
where you don't want to take anything
out of the house so I you know America
is a big place but I do want to say I do
want to get to one more guest before we
have to sign up so juan carlos i will
ask you for your final thoughts if you
have them or a final question final
question yes night to any most beautiful
phone ever made see the 1i have to see
the one but i don't like the verizon I
don't know it is i don't know from your
wire I don't get and it is and it's what
we were talking about just a second ago
with it with the square design compared
to the title i I don't I can you know
it's it's it's definite it's interesting
to see how much of a change it is
because i think everyone most people
agree that the 920's design is very
appealing even if it is a bit heavy and
this is it with the exception of some of
the common design elements it's it's
very very very different so really
really quick everybody say everybody say
is heavy but you know that when you grab
the nights when you say this is well
done everybody everybody everybody say
oh it's too heavy when when you grab it
to say like and stings I am so I don't
know yeah the way I got it no different
so one girl she would I'm hearing may be
that you would not give what would be
your thumbs up or thumbs down on the 928
it sounds like you're not too enthused
about maybe 20 25 for the extra extra
lens because time when you take a
picture in the lights kind of like
blurry right maybe that but I will wait
for the maybe for me Windows Phone need
to be quad-core and need to be needs to
be ready because I will know by another
windows phone with the one but if I had
to pay a thousand dollars you bet I will
I will not know why yeah what about the
one comes what about the Xperia tablet Z
the thumbs up or thumbs down don't stop
it's really beautiful nice i wanna go
thank you very much for joining it's
great to to get a call from the
Dominican Republic great to get somebody
with some really strong opinions thank
you for for joining us today yeah Thank
You Ezra figure all right hi mate would
you like the honor of choosing our last
guest of the day okay Hendrick you've
been ever since we started this call so
I feel really bad having to go without
talking to you how's everything can you
hear yeah I can hear you okay um you
know you are Hendrick welcoming other
your review sorry sorry for the latency
there yeah you know that's all it's
funny that the only FC Barcelona fan of
your team it's choosing yes if I am
unique then oh okay then so it's a great
team you've gotta get you've got a great
new trainer now so that's that's that
has a lot to do with it I hope so I hope
so no but tell us what do you think
about the tablet Z or the Lumia 928
which product do you want to talk about
specifically and I'm not gonna
disappoint you but I want to talk about
the devisee okay toss no I nearly run
two years by Android and iOS and this
happened like four days ago no let me
lock the camera on you there oh is it
just one crack or is it various cracks
it is like the
you can see it it's very much wait let
us know it looks like it's taking the
film off the bezel there is that what's
going on like it yeah what what's
happened what's how is that it's an iPad
second generation okay sadly it's it's
more than one crack for those of you
that don't know if you only have one
crack on your iPad that's covered by
your warranty it's a single line single
hairline crack is covered you can just
take the ipad to an apple store wherever
and they'll give you a new one
interesting that's good to know how many
yeah i'm inside yeah i've already done
like two swaps like that but man so sad
that that's a really bad news so you're
considering a tablet z now and no
further i was in the bathroom and just
watching some podcast and pick it up by
the flip cover and it went down and
straight on my bathtub and so are you
are you shopping are you in the market
for a for a tablet z are you are you're
thinking about it what are your thought
and I I need a tablet like when I go to
sleep I need some music in the
background or just listen to some
podcasts and that's that's good with it
added so I choose this body what do we
got there that's a nexus 10 as net yeah
it's a nexus 10 running trick droid the
newest version and yeah I'm pretty much
it's a fine tablet I thought about
getting the Xperia Z but yeah the Tappan
Zee I mean but the Xperia Z as a
smartphone isn't good in my opinion now
yeah what yeah the experience he is is
not terribly compelling to me for a
variety of reasons but the Xperia tablet
Z is is more so and it kind of bears out
how different these categories are right
um well it all seems like if two
different departments built these
products like it like if it's not the
same ability department that built
either because there was a good product
choices for the tablet Z and then again
with the Xperia Z it's the complete
opposite yeah but it isn't this
is the display on the tablet Z like it's
grayish also we were doing a little
talking about that before the tablet Z
has a display that I think performs
better than the one on the Xperia Z
smartphone and I'm going to see if I can
get a just a nice white panel here for
for Twitter and and do a little side so
you can see if you know that brightness
falls off pretty quickly but the clarity
does not and you can see the colors look
at this look at this this is black yeah
and she's only logo and look at this
yeah I'm gonna lock it on you in there
feel wider and that is not so let me let
me boot the tablet Z and I will I will
compare that with you see that's the
thing that turned us off about the
tablet Z excuse me about the xperia z
god these product names are confusing
when we were at Jaime where was at CES
Yesi yes yeah but the Z is not the
tablet Z is not like that necessarily
now I'm prompting it to boot right now
and I'll do the same thing for you now
that is without the screen protector is
that right that is without the screen
protector all right I meant take the
lock off you analyzing economy months so
check mark screen look at the lock
screen buttons they're supposed to be
just dimmed out bezels and as it turns
out look at how whitish they become as
you tell the display yeah I'm gonna run
out I'm gonna run out of boot animation
here so I have a look at the black now
you that's perfect black nice now so
they've really enric to answer your
question they've really done a much
nicer job with the display on this then
on the the smartphone variant of the of
the xperia c it looks that would be
better than on the it is and you know i
mean some of these colors you know
unfortunately we're doing all this with
with crappy webcams abut but you know
some of these colors really just pop and
of course you got fingerprints you got
my big overhead light there in you
really need to wipe the screen off about
every five minutes but if you're willing
to do that then these these colors
really pop especially for an LCD so it
sounds you know i want to say that it
sounds like i'm often defending this
product and then the full review of
course I call out its multitude of
failings I just think that it's it's so
surprising to be able to generate a
product like this that's so unbelievably
thin that's so lightweight and
it operates relatively well you know I
think it serves laughing come on if it
were my money right now if the nexus 7
wouldn't exist and i had to choose an
android tablet for specific reasons
that's the tablet that i would buy yeah
you know and increasingly i'm feeling
that way too and i don't want to give it
away cuz it's gonna go to other team
members to do comparisons and like no I
don't want to want to do that hendrik it
given the chance again you you seem very
happy with your nexus 10 but knowing
that the Xperia tablet Z supports AOSP
etcetera etc would you would you
consider this or what what would keep
you from from getting at just a question
I'm definitely against Sony I can't
stand the firm the brand i use an xbox I
used to have a PlayStation but i can't
stand for sony what is like what is it
about the brand what is it about the
company that you don't that you don't
like because i don't have much
experience with them that sorry why are
you from where are you from let's start
with that I'm from Germany ok gotcha
okay and yeah I'm like more like I used
to have a samsung galaxy s3 and also
this one correct so maybe it's bad luck
and i bought this bother you oh yes nice
nice i think that sounds like more of an
of a user problem minute maybe maybe I'm
what out before before we wrap it up
with you and Rick what is it exactly
about the about the sony brand that is
that is unappealing to you is it just
aesthetics is it a you don't like their
design or what is it now these I don't
have a dense that's great no it's a
better good quality in the Nexus I'm
sure but um it's a bit laggy i watch
your reviews and also the ipad versus
the fabbity review you uploaded today or
yesterday and interfaces kind of laggy
and with the nexus i get to do the
android and exclude make upgrades it's
right in time and that's that big point
for me I like to root my phone and flesh
new firmware like nearly every day and
with the next end of my data to other
from home sounds like you got a choice
it's with sony products and sitter miss
you know sometimes you get support
sometimes you don't probably it's
interesting because sony has such brand
appeal in latin america i mean when if
you if you walked into somebody's house
you could determine if that person had
or did not have money of their products
or either made by sony or by lucky gold
star which is now LG mmm interesting
that that you don't have that same brand
recognition because for me this product
is that the ZL is disappointing because
you know i use the Xperia S last year
and this play was just gorgeous the
camera the photos of the camera were
gorgeous and then you come a year later
with better design and lesser quality
materials yes confusing right yeah but
but you didn't have that problem with
the tablet z Michael which is just
interesting yes and which I'm pleased to
see and somebody seems to be getting
increasingly serious about mobile and
we'll see what what else they do i will
say that that today the tablet z has
done fairly well on the you review
hendrik i would like to get your score
if you don't mind can you give us a
thumbs-up or a thumbs-down overall on
the tablet z I think you can guess it I
love to have a good spectrum that's nice
and we didn't have any flavor to our
spectrum so far so thank you for your
for your honest feedback and Hendrick
tell people where they can find you on
the internet if you like yeah they can
find me on Twitter it's 80 + n es ch
thank you very much and and really uh
thank you very much for calling in all
the way from from Germany and hopefully
we'll see you on another episode yeah I
love it thank you both thank you sir
writer Jaime it sounds like it looks to
me like we are button up against the
clock and yeah we have to bail do you
agree I do agree yes I do have to before
we go and before we lose everybody in
the in the bottom rim in there I want to
thank you guys for old not I'm sorry we
couldn't get to you this time around but
i do want to announce also the scores
which will be a surprise to positively
no one starting with the Lumia 928 which
was such a non focus of
this episode that is relegated to the
sidelines here's you that tell you
something about Windows Phone no it's a
verizon branded phone I may stop see we
got this whole episode without you
making a new enemies and now you're
gonna ruin it now uh it we have we have
a amusing once again the galaxy note 2
to keep score no it's not a sponsorship
I'm just using it we have one thumbs up
for the 928 one thumbs down 29 28 and
one right middle of the road sort of tie
so interesting not quite as interesting
as the Xperia tablet Z which garnered
six thumbs ups 2 1 thumbs down thank you
everyone for your votes not surprised a
little bit surprised though at the level
of interest of this device if you
haven't read our review please go read
it leave a comment if you feel like it
because no one else does I'm a closing
thoughts before we get out of here uh so
many needs to do much more of a brand
question it's interesting that they used
CES to launch the xperia touted the
Xperia Z and ZL and still we don't see
these products in the United States yet
um so I feel that they they have a lot
more work to do yes the tablet Z is a
beautiful product but it's not heavily
available in the market yet so there is
a lot of work that Sony needs to do
right now and as far as the Lumia 928
trashcan and shipping label please you
You cheeky bastard all right man hey I'm
