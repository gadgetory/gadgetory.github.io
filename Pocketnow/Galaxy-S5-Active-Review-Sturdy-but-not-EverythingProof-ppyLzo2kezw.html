like phones that get dirty after all
these things are supposed to be life
companions sticking by your side no
matter how muddy wet or bumpy your slog
through life becomes we got a taste of
that with this year's Galaxy s5 and it's
water-resistant casing and now Samsung
is taking things up a notch with the
Galaxy s5 active is this the smartphone
you should buy if your life is more a
construction site than corporate office
find out in our video review let's get
the most common objection out of the way
first if you wanted a durable phone
you'd just buy a durable case right no
the whole idea of a phone built from the
inside out to be durable is that you
don't need to drop the extra 60 bucks on
a bulky case and the Galaxy s5 active is
indeed built to be durable it carries
the same immersion rating as the
standard s5 but it also brings milspec
durability to boot that means it should
hold up to exotic stuff like vibration
and altitude temperature humidity
extremes but also to the mundane tests
of everyday life like impacts but as
always it's crucial to read the fine
print
samsung warns us that the device may not
perform as shown in all extreme
conditions in real life testing over
about 10 days we found that to mean that
the Galaxy s5 active is either impact
resistant or water resistant but not
necessarily both at the same time at
first the phone was a great diving
companion giving us an opportunity to
film some of the more florescent sea
life we've seen in a local fountain but
dropping the phone onto a hard surface
jarred something loose in our test
device which then allowed water into the
formerly water-resistant casing that
wasn't much fun and even after a day of
drying out we were still forced to get a
replacement unit to complete this review
now to be fair the fatal cocktail of
impact plus immersion doesn't
must affect Samsung phones as we found
out with the Xperia z1s a few months
back but we were able to trip up the s5
active without water as well a drop on
to a hard drive
jarred the SIM card loose that was an
easy fix all we had to do was reboot it
to get it back online but if you're
going out of your way to claim that a
product is most everything-proof beefing
it up with extra plastic and even
painting a camouflage pattern on it to
show the world how tough it is well
you've got a tougher burden of proof -
you should make sure that it actually is
more durable than it's lighter slimmer
compatriots while we're on the subject
of other devices some good news
this year's active edition Galaxy S
doesn't make nearly as many sacrifices
as last year's model yes the charging
port takes a step down from USB 3.0 to
2.0 and we lose the fingerprint scanner
but we don't consider either of these a
terribly great loss in more important
aspects you're getting everything the s5
offers from the high-speed processor to
the 5.1 inch AMOLED display in an
automatic mode that screen gets almost
unbelievably bright in direct sunlight
making it one of the more readable
outdoor displays we've seen and say what
you will about Samsung's software it
makes that AMOLED screen look good it's
the same software we covered in depth in
our galaxy s5 review Samsung's newest
version of TouchWiz riding atop Android
4.4.2 and it's just as fluid and
responsive here the only significant
difference is the activity zone a pretty
bare-bones collection of vaguely
outdoorsy features it would be cooler if
it integrated more fully into other
aspects of the device as it stands now
it certainly looks good but it's also
very Spartan it just kind of feels
hastily thrown together the new blue
active key on the side launches the
activity zone by default but it can be
reassigned to access other apps
including the camera
sadly Samsung hasn't given that key the
ability to wake the device from standby
you still need to unlock the phone the
conventional way first and then hit the
button so we're left wondering why it's
even there
shooting with a 16 megapixel camera is
an awful lot like shooting with the s5s
which is to say that the end results can
be really really good from the sharp
just slightly oversaturated daylight
shots to the effective but not overblown
HDR mode you can get some nice captures
and bright lighting and we especially
like the ability to shoot in full
resolution using a widescreen format
using the active key as a camera shutter
makes underwater photos easier to
capture though getting focus is still
tricky on the whole no matter what
you're trying to photograph on your
outdoor adventures the active probably
won't disappoint unless of course you're
shooting at night we already covered
this on our galaxy s5 review so we won't
belabor the point but this device isn't
necessarily the one you want with you
when it comes to low-light photography
thankfully video output is gorgeous
again given the right lighting framerate
is a little low in the default mode but
you've got options available to smooth
that out and you can also shoot in
slo-mo or crank the resolution all the
way up to 4k if you like the device is
sensitive to shakes and shimmies though
so make sure you've got a steady hand
when you're sneaking up on wildlife in
terms of day-to-day performance the
galaxy s5 active is say with us a whole
lot like the galaxy s5 from phone calls
to gaming to s-health
to the rear firing but surprisingly
loudspeaker the s5 active sticks close
to its roots as a solid performer
especially on ATT's excellent LTE
network here in Boston the phone does
have at least one annoying quirk though
it often wakes up in our pocket for no
good reason
something the stock s5 doesn't really do
we're not sure why this is but since it
happened on both our review devices we
thought it worth mentioning keep a close
eye on that because while the battery is
removable that screen sucks power
quickly in super-bright outdoor mode
with almost no price difference on ATT
between the s5 active and the galaxy s5
which one to buy depends on how much
meat you really need on your smartphones
bones
remember the stock s5 is already
water-resistant and while a milspec
rating should mean the active is much
more durable in our experience that just
doesn't seem to be the case at least in
every day drops and fumbles for most
people the standard Galaxy s5 will offer
enough durability to last the length of
a two-year contract for you folks who
truly need the slight edge that the
milspec 810 rating provides the active
is probably the better choice just don't
test its limits and don't believe it's
