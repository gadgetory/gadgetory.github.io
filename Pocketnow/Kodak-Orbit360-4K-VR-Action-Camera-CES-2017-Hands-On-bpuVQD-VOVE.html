products the kodak pixpro SP 360 was one
of the first cameras to properly support
360 degree horizontal video but only in
a vertical Half Dome the next camera
fixed that but only if you bought two
cameras and bolted them together but now
we arrive at the orbit 360 for K
properly including 220 megapixel image
sensors each with an ultra wide-angle
lens
producing fully spherical 4k video the
standard set of tricks is of course
included NFC support with Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi radios to pair with Android and
iOS devices microSD card support for up
to 128 gigabyte cards and the orbit will
have a mic input and HDMI output adding
quite a bit of flexibility to the
built-in hardware and phone based app
control kodak will also be selling an
optional Bluetooth controller which can
be mounted to Steadicam or selfie sticks
even with two large dome lenses this is
a fairly rugged housing rated IP 65 for
dust and water resistance with the port
cover closed now 360 degree video is
still finding its footing for consumer
applications here the pix pro team is
improving the backend experience for
editing and sharing the camera can
capture higher-quality video files from
each lens saved as separate files and
merged through a program installed on a
computer or the orbit can immediately
output a merged 360 degree video at a
lower bitrate and for those times you
don't need the full field of view from
both cameras you can shift to a standard
wide-angle UHD video looking similar to
other action cameras on the market
previous pixpro cameras have arrived
well accessorized with mounts brackets
and clips and we'd expect the orbit to
come similarly equipped when the camera
shifts in the first quarter of 2017 for
499 dollars as always thanks so much for
