how many shirts do you have last time I
Canada was 27 hello everyone I'm a
potato yeah I guess you are hi miss
Joker impression is enough to make any
DC fan boy cry want to know how I got
these scars that's right it's that time
of the week I am high metal even at this
is pocket now and this is the bargain
out daily recap for last week on Monday
we began the comments with LG we saw the
company launched its new fingerprint
capable display and I asked you how
important our fingerprint scanners
whenever you buy a smartphone we had 639
comments I don't even lock my phone too
lazy yeah I know a ton of people that
are and that's weird fingerprint scanner
is something you really don't care about
if you have not used it but once you use
it it's hard to go back that is
precisely the case with fingerprint
scanners and smart watches these are
things you don't need but once you start
using them it's extremely hard to go
back I totally agree with you
fingerprint scanner is a given hi MA
would love to see face iris unlock
detection become the norm great fit as
always thanks a lot buddy and I would
like to see that iris scanner and all
the problem is you know just holding
your phone and the amount of time that
it takes is just it's really bad it has
to be like fingerprint scanners where
it's just instant on Tuesday the topic
was the iphone 7 we saw some leaks that
the headphone jack might make the cut
and I asked you how important is it for
you we had 620 comments yes cuz you
won't listen to music while charging
your phone I do love this comment I hate
adapters it's the main reason why I
haven't bought the new macbook and okay
I would prefer to have a headphone jack
I do feel that we should make a move to
headphone jacks that use higher quality
audio but i would rather apple at a USB
type-c connector for there to be a
standard like the headphone jack and not
force us to by lightning headphones or
USB type-c headphones that would be
horrible people would still buy the new
iphone even if it didn't come with a
cellular antenna I don't think people
are that stupid dude if Apple would take
out the camera completely they would
still buy it Apple fans or Apple fans
just paying for the brand dude you have
no idea how many flops Apple's had in
its history if that were true the Apple
TV would sell like hotcakes if that were
true iPads would still sell like
hotcakes if that were true the Apple
watch would sell insanely it's not the
case man on Wednesday the topic was time
magazine's recent rankings where they
consider the iphone to be the most
influential gadget of all time I asked
you of you agreed and we had 670
comments the original iphone yes now not
at all Apple's innovation died with
steve job you know it's funny I actually
don't agree with this I feel that Steve
Jobs did an amazing job at simplifying
what a smartphone should do and doing it
really well but that didn't mean an
evasion the iphone remains stuck with a
small display for the longest time and
it couldn't do a lot of things for the
longest time people have just forgotten
about that no the Nokia 3310 that was
the phone that revolutionized the way
people see mobile devices d√©mocratie
sized mobile phones without it the
iphone would have never happened where
is that successor to the Nokia 3310
there isn't right the iphone first
generation was the biggest hit on the
tech world this is coming from an
Android user Nexus 6p you know a lot of
people continue referencing the first
generation iphone and you forgot a ton
of things actually that wasn't the
iphone if anything i would say that it
was the iphone 4 why not the first
iphone well because it was extremely
clunky it only had 2g it didn't have
third-party applications and didn't
multitask it didn't even have cut copy
and paste it was a very rudimentary
iphone that was a great stepping point
to what it is now why the iPhone 4 Wow
720p video was the first smartphone
camera that I considered to be great
which is pretty much the trend of
smartphones lately it's set the
priorities for what smartphones do now
but that's my opinion on Thursday there
was speculation over an HTC vive
spin-off a new company and I asked you
do you really think the VR is important
enough to warrant a new company we had
345 comments I have the vibe and once I
put it on I do
want to take it out anymore that's how
good it is i also have a gear vr but
it's nowhere nearly as good as the vibe
yes the vibe is a product in its own
I've tested the oculus rift I have a
gear VR the vibe is just completely
different I feel that there is a need
for more content that takes advantage of
what the vibe can do but I do feel that
it's a tremendous starting point up to
the point where yes hcc should take it
seriously no the live seems to be a
success so far due to nearly every
gaming youtuber using it at some point
and keeping the HTC in name and whatever
it is you say they're at next yes
there's a lot of buzz with the vibe
right now but you know it's like for
example in our case in this channel
we're not sponsored by anyone HTC
doesn't pay everyone and even if hcc did
I don't think the company is doing well
enough right now to pay so many
youtubers the product is just really
good you know it's one of those products
where even when I reviewed it I had a
hard time figuring out how to do the
review to be able to tell you about it
because it's really hard for us to look
that excited and not looked as if it
were biased or anything I do understand
the purpose of the comment but this is
just one of those products that i would
highly suggest you go give a try before
you judge it do not judge this book by
it's cover you said it will be there
someday if we want to get there someday
companies are going to have to start
making bold boobs like HTC yes I do
agree there is a way to do things that
are half-baked I feel its smartphone VR
is still a little half-baked because the
smartphone wasn't really designed for it
it can do it it's practical if you're
traveling for example but if you really
want reality to be virtual or no should
I say if you want virtual to feel real
you need to take the steps that the vibe
did true and then finally Friday the
topic was the galaxy note 6 light there
are rumors of a snapdragon 820 processor
variant which is pretty much the galaxy
s7 on the note which is what we
currently have with a galaxy note 5 and
a galaxy s6 and ask you if you have to
choose when you go for the light with a
Snapdragon 820 or would you go for the
Snapdragon 823 variant which would be or
we assume would be the note 6 we had 574
ments note equals power or that's what
it should be uh yes I do agree with you
probably one of the reasons why I don't
use the note 5 is because you're using a
galaxy s6 pretty much for me know it's
like saying let's find Bugatti very
unsure on our white version how
ridiculous is that the note series is
meant to be a flagship class let's stick
to it you have to understand that that
note 6 light is apparently going to have
flagship specifications only it's
pulling the galaxy s7 spec so that's not
necessarily a bad thing want to note 6
as powerful as it can be in as beautiful
as it can be that is my opinion the note
has always stood up for being the classy
phablet the phone that's inspirational
the phone that the business guy is going
to be carrying around and it's going to
make you look good it has a lot to do
with the fact that also it's a
powerhouse non compromise if the
Snapdragon a 23 is the processor that's
out I want that to be on the next note i
want that next note to not be
overshadowed by the future galaxy s
that's my opinion and now there's a
helicopter passing by
god this is the recap with the most
interruptions in history every gaming
youtuber using it at some point every
gaming youtuber using it at point being
it at some point and keeping the HTC in
name will that's it for the pocket out
