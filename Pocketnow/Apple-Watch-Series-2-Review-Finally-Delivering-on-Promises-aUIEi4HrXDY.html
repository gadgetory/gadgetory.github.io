Apple watch the first generation model
promised a lot but was too clunky to the
liver and it didn't really age well for
the $400 that I paid for it it was a
huge letdown but so has every single
first generation Apple product version
two is usually works worth investing and
now it's time to prove that right or
wrong I'm hiding that out with pocket
now and this is our review of the Apple
watch series too so let's begin by
saying the most important fact about the
Apple watch series - everything that
Apple said that the first watch could do
and suck that well series - actually can
visually the new variant is almost
identical to last year's model and
that's actually not a bad thing these
similarities mean that the current watch
bands and some accessories work with it
just fine in case you want to upgrade we
chose to try the woven nylon band that
Apple sells as a complement to the sport
band during the day but keep in mind
that there are a ton of third-party
solutions from Amazon that look just as
great and work just fine on series -
really to tell them apart you need to
notice that there's a second microphone
on the left side because the added
millimeter and thickness is
indistinguishable the same can be said
about the thicker glass on the new model
so if you're asking yourself why should
you upgrade of these watches are so much
alike well because everything that
changed is actually important the main
complaint about the first Apple watch is
that it was too clunky I mean the whole
selling point was that it could run
applications but then these wouldn't
load or would take forever apples do is
to chip addresses this with dual core
performance and the results are just a
night-and-day when compared to last
year's model the second complaint was
that the screen was too dim for those of
you using the sapphire glass variant and
to address that the brightness has
nearly doubled so much so that in the
case of my ion X variant I use it at
minimum brightness and I'm just fine
with it
the third complaint was durability and
accuracy where the
posit vac would scratch so bad that
sensors were just totally unreliable
series 2 now includes a ceramic back
across all models for scratch resistance
though notice I said series 2 the new
series 1 sticks to the composite
materials and I personally do not
recommend them lastly the first model
was supposed to serve phone calls and
yes they were terrible series 2 includes
a new and very impressive speaker that
not only sounds well but people on the
other end of the call could not really
tell that I was using the watch and
there's even a nifty new feature that
clears water from the speaker through
sound and why clear out water
well because Apple watch series 2 takes
fitness activities a lot more seriously
it's now water resistant up to 50 meters
to support swimming and has grown up to
include GPS tracking for outdoor
activities and am i testing running
outdoors I've noticed that the watch
takes around half a mile for the GPS to
catch up with my phone comparisons but
after that it's extremely accurate still
you don't really need to bring a phone
now that you have a GPS just use the
built-in Siksika bytes of storage to
sync your music and pair your favorite
bluetooth headphones and leave the extra
smartphone bulk behind the battery will
last around 5 hours of GPS tracking
which matches your typical Garmin but
for everything else I'm really impressed
with battery life with a standard hour
to two hours of fitness activities every
day I usually end with around 60 to 50
percent of battery life left which makes
it even convenient for sleep tracking
what I usually do is just charge it the
next day when I shower and it tops it
off just fine by the time I'm done now
for those of you asking just how much I
enjoy using Apple watch Series 2 for
everything else my response is a little
mixed watch it which 3 plays a major
role in me liking it a little more the
new dark feature on the side button is
really convenient for multitasking and
making more sense than the context being
there in the past I also love that you
can switch your watch face with a simple
slide to the left or right but I won't
why there are other features like for
example of the
old crown that I rarely use though it
doesn't mean that it's not nice to have
them around and then there are the
little things that I loved about the
first model like the ability to very
accurately detect when I raise my wrists
or when I put my wrist down and how it
automatically locks itself the moment
you take it off and you can unlock it
with touch ID as well something really
cool now where I still feel that the
Apple watch series 2 fails in comparison
to every other SmartWatch is in the
basics like notifications for example
where it's just extremely annoying to
always get an animated icon and be
interrupted by the icon every time
you're trying to read a message I feel
that Apple really needs to redo the
whole concept of how notifications work
and ask for applications I have to admit
that I rarely use them sure they launch
faster but the experience is still too
crammed for me to prefer using this than
to pull the phone out about the only
exceptions are when I use Siri for Apple
maps for walking directions in the city
and controlling honk it from the watch
and also keeping up with my daily
activities maybe your usage scenario
changes but at least for me the Smart
Watch is really not for the apps and
again notifications really need to go
back to the drawing board and I guess
the specific argument is the perfect way
to conclude back to the matter is you
don't really need an Apple watch or even
a SmartWatch for that matter but we do
have to be fair and clarify that there
are certain things that the watch will
do better than your phone a smartphone
was simply not designed to track your
fitness activities even if some
companies try even find the inclusion of
a heart rate sensor on certain
smartphones to be a gimmick you really
need permanent tracking for this to be
done right but then again there are also
less expensive fitness trackers that can
do this if you don't want to pay so much
for the Apple watch probably the main
selling point for the Apple watch is
just how well it works in just about
everything
swap a band to go to the gym swap
another to go to work have all those
statistics combined in one place and
have these on a watch that can do far
more than two
fitness if you're upgrading I highly
suggest that you sell your old Apple
watch on eBay and get this one as I said
at the beginning the Apple watch series
2 is finally what Apple promised that
the first one should have always been
but it's not necessarily the only
SmartWatch that works with an iPhone
