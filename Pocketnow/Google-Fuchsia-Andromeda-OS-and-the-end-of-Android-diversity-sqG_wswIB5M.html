something of a philosophical question
for you fine folks especially you fans
of Android every year we expect our
phones and our tablets to get more
powerful more powerful more RAM better
features and yet with regular use over
time we have to expect those same
devices to get slower and slower and
companies are trying to address those
problems Huawei with the undividable
with the pixel but ultimately it would
seem that Google's biggest strengths the
diversity of the Android ecosystem is
still one of its biggest weaknesses when
you can run Android on literally
anything with the processor it becomes a
little bit more difficult to really hone
in on that super tight hardware software
optimization looking at the landscape I
don't really think horsepower is the
problem even our mid-range chipsets are
capable of some pretty astounding feats
you've got bones powered by the Qualcomm
625 that are out there shooting 4k video
and when we leave the general-purpose
computing land of consumer electronics
and look at a single purpose platform
powered by the same hardware we see some
pretty incredible stuff last year we saw
a fighter pilot AI that was starting to
rival human fighter pilots that was
powered by a Raspberry Pi Hardware in
this phone is more powerful but it has
to do a lot more stuff and a lot more
stuff a lot less efficiently as we're
starting to get little bits of
information filtering in on Andromeda
and Google future future operating
system projects from Google is it time
to walk away from the broader diversity
that we enjoy and Android and start
focusing in more on hardware and
software optimization from the consumer
standpoint would we miss that wider
array of choices if it meant
significantly better performance we've
got a little viewer poll that probably
just pops up above my head and drop us a
comment down below this video to share
your thoughts as always thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe to
this channel for more rambling vloggy
videos like these and be on the lookout
for our future MWC coverage i'm going to
be on a plane next week to Barcelona to
do some cool stuff out there and help us
out with some sharing on your favorite
social networks for packing out I'm Juan
Carlos now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
