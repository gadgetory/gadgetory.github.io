pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at which of these
nine devices has the best keyboard
basically I have these devices arranged
by keyboard type so we start with the
devices with the slide out keyboards
like the touch pro and the Titan 2 and
then going down the line we have the
devices with on-screen keyboards and
finally devices that have keyboards
built right into them so we're going to
start at the top and go to the bottom
and here are the rules on each device i
will type the quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog spelling doesn't have
to be perfect it just has to be
comprehensible because we're trying to
simulate you know sending a text message
you're sending an email I will be timing
how long it takes to type that phrase so
that at the end we have a winner okay
we're going to start with the HTC touch
pro now what I like about this
particular keyboard is that it has five
rows so that you can get the dedicated
number row here at the top I'm going to
start off by going into office mobile
and opening upward ready set go
that was 12 seconds 12 seconds on the
touch pro okay now we're going to do the
Titan two or the 18 detailed as many
people know it what I like about this
device is it has the tilting screen so
it makes it a little easier to position
the device for optimum keyboard typing
the keys are also bigger than they are
on the touch pro because it has not as
many rows of keys so let's go into word
ready set go
that was about 13 seconds okay so now
we're on to the devices with the
on-screen keyboard and I'm going to
start off with the HTC touch this is the
touch on the verizon network and i'm
going to go into office mobile and i'm
going to use the suretype keyboard that
comes on the device set go
that was 16 seconds okay now we have the
samsung omnia which like the touch has a
shirt type like keyboards i'm going to
go into office mobile ready set go
that was 13 seconds now we'll do the
iphone the last device that i have here
with a keyboard on the screen so i'm
just going to go into the notes
application set go
that was 11 seconds the fastest yet okay
next up we have the motorola q 9h ready
set go stop that was eight seconds
absolutely the fastest yet okay next up
we have the palm treo pro which has a
pretty small keyboard but we'll see how
how how we do on the test here go into
word set go
stop
that was nine seconds pretty fast now we
have the old vintage treo 700w it
actually has the same keyboard as the
modern-day treo 750 they changed the
keyboard on the treo pro to be a little
bit smaller and to have this kind of
horizontal layout instead of the curved
ones so let's see how this does set go
stop that was nine seconds and finally
we have the blackjack two and this is an
important test because this same
keyboard is going to be used on the
upcoming samsung epix which some people
thought was going to be the blackjack
three but it's really not going to be
called that so let's see how this
keyboard does set go
that was that was 11 seconds what I like
about this keyboard is that it's spaced
out quite nicely but the problem with it
is that the keys are kind of hard to
press compared to like the q9h where
they have just enough feedback so in
conclusion of the devices that we tested
the motorola q9 each came on top here I
just wish Motorola would continue using
this keyboard but with a touchscreen
configuration I think a lot of people
would agree with me on that in second
place we have both of the trio's and I'm
actually a little bit surprised that the
treo pro is able to keep up with the
bigger keyboard of the treo 700w but I
think what really helps the treo pro is
the fact that the keys are so close
together that you hardly have to move
your fingers when you're your thumbs
when you're trying to type a message and
of the devices with the on-screen
keyboards the iphone one and the touch
the verizon XV 6900 came in last place
I've always found it very difficult to
type on this device perhaps it's just
how small the devices and the
responsiveness of the touchscreen and
finally if we look at the devices that
have the slide out keyboards touch pro
and the 18t tilt we find that the touch
pro is a slightly better keyboard in
terms of being able to type fast and I
think that's because although the
letters are smaller the keys are smaller
they're spaced closer together and as we
saw with the treo pro closer together
often means less finger travel which
means you can type faster for people
that have large sized hands this may be
a problem but for the person with the
average-sized hand or small size 10
smaller keyboards actually seem to to be
conducive to faster typing so that's it
