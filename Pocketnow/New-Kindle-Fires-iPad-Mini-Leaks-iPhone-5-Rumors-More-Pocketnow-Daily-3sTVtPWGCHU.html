ipad mini housing photos emerged and
Apple is already threatening to drop the
iphone 4s to just eight gigabytes I'm hi
Mary Vera strong supporter of lots and
lots of storage and this is parking out
daily amazon has just announced their
new Kindle Fire lineup which includes
not one but three tablets first of all
the already known kindle fire with
double the specs and fifty bucks off the
price and then you get a new Kindle Fire
HD which includes a seven inch and an
8.9 inch model which are HD but nothing
really groundbreaking though the devices
are really good and Amazon was really
pushy about all the specs on these
tablets so if you're interested they're
available for pre-order today but sadly
no there was no phone announced now even
though apple's iphone 5 event is just a
week away there are tons of rumors that
apple will release and iPad Mini later
this year rumors now have a new image of
the housing of this new iPad Mini or I
book or whatever Apple is going to call
it but the difference now is that this
time it has a back camera when past
cases it didn't have a back camera and
this device is the Wi-Fi only model
apparently now with all the disruption
of the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire are
doing in the 7-inch tablet market it's
only understandable that Apple wants a
piece of the pie the questions went now
sprint has just shed some love with
galaxy nexus and nexus s 4g customers by
allowing them to finally download
android 4.1 jelly bean this is the
typical over-the-air upgrade well you'll
be able to access Google now and other
features like project butter the only
irony what the story is why Sprint has a
Nexus device that can't behave like a
Nexus device anyways a recent leak shows
verizon's full fall lineup for this
holiday season and it includes a HTC
device which many people assume it's
their 1080p phablet which i assume is
the 1x Varian coming to verizon but the
cool news was a nokia lumia 822 on the
list which means that verizon's finally
coming back to Windows Phone that's
great news for this holiday season sadly
there was no Lillian 9
22 variant on the list but hey anything
can happen and finally let's end the
week by talking iphone 5 rumors first of
all the recent NFC antenna leaks now
apparently aren't NFC antennas some
experts now are saying that this is just
the speaker so that's going to be bad
news of the iphone doesn't have NFC even
though many people don't really use it
and then on the other sad news is that
obviously Apple drops their current
generation iphones into the entry-level
market so they drop the storage but the
problem is that apparently the iphone 4s
is going for eight gigabytes which well
the other pests devices did but the
problem is hate gigabytes they're going
to stick to a gigabytes on that then
it's going to be the typical a gigabyte
iphone 4 and then the iphone 3gs is
going to say goodbye but that leads me
to the question of the day can you guys
survive with 8 gigabytes I mean in my
case my whole music library is 32
gigabytes so leave us a comment down
below now we want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
