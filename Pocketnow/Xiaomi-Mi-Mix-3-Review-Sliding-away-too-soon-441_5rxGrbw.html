geun-hye weekly and any of my own
content over the last few months you
know that I actually applaud the knotch
not because I thought it actually led to
anything truly worthwhile but because
smartphone manufacturers began
scrambling to find ways of abolishing it
we got a look at what could be the new
craze the hole punch and it was just a
little while ago with the honor of u-20
but while I don't hate the hole punch at
all I do have one problem with it it is
leading to the death of some really fun
form factors that barely had any time in
the Sun this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
this is a look at one of the last
bastions of the slider design this is a
look at the Xiaomi me mix three now
before I begin a disclaimer this won't
be a super in-depth review I will give
some thoughts on my experience with this
phone but the focus of this video is on
the different design concepts that came
after the notch but before the new hole
punches spoiler alert I adore this phone
not just because it is different from
pretty much any other flagship out there
right now
but also because it fulfills a promise
that Xiaomi made with their first mimics
device look at that screen the supposed
future of the smartphone was supposed to
have no compromises in the display what
you're supposed to have in your hand
according to Xiaomi was a glorious
presentation of the digital world and
while Xiaomi tried to make that a
reality by putting the front-facing
camera on the bottom of their first two
attempts they realized that they could
just hide it altogether by putting it
literally behind the display and so
slide it on down and there it is the
return of the slider concept was not
only exciting but also really addicting
just that tactile movement and click up
and down for the screen meant that the
mimics three could be the same fidget
toy that sliders of old used to be and
me oh I even baked in some extra fun in
the form of sound effects when the slide
occurred and this was on top of extra
functions for when one slides and the
screen from stambha now while fun the
sliding mechanism makes way for the true
joy of this phone using a full screen
with no interruptions seriously this
Super AMOLED screen looks great and
gives you everything no compromises you
don't really notice things like notches
and hole punches and other devices until
you get to use a literal full screen
like this
Media looks great in games like the
newly released nostalgia trip ragnarok
em performed wonderfully especially
because of the internal specs
I actually got decent battery life
during my binges of the game reaching
four hours of screen on time when I just
couldn't stop trying to reach monk class
with my character you get the snapdragon
845 along with six eight or even ten
gigabytes of RAM in a special edition of
the phone and you can get up to 256
gigabytes of on-board storage the body
was made of shammies trademark ceramic
that can slip when you're trying to
slide the screen down but thankfully in
the box is a case included so you can
help maintain your grip an extra button
triggers voice assistance which means
Google assistant in this global edition
of the phone and ROM and they also kept
the traditional fingerprint reader on
the back me oh I got some update since I
first got my hands on this phone and
while it won't be most people's cup of
tea I actually think it is really simple
and clean it has a certain speed and
smoothness that makes up for the lack of
an Abbe drawer and some extra features
help add to the overall experience like
the app vault the hiding front-facing
camera reminds you to slide the screen
down when getting selfies but the
pictures come out looking pretty decent
albeit a bit soft because of the beauty
modes and because this is kind of common
in Chinese phones now DX Omar gave the
rear cameras a really good mark and the
dual 12 megapixel shooters indeed do a
good job pictures come out looking
pretty detailed that the colors look
fine and for the most part there's not a
whole lot of noise until you get into
lower light shots and it's at this point
that the phone comes with its own
version of a night mode where eight
photos are taken at different exposures
to combine and make one final result
this night mode is pretty quick too
making it useful in more situations
where long exposure might be a nuisance
while some other camera forward phones
might have a bit more to offer there's
no denying that Xiaomi did a great job
of tuning their shooter and it
definitely deserves those high marks ok
so there aren't too many bells and
whistles aside from the sliding
mechanism and honestly I think that was
the right move aside from a snap here
and a snap there the rest of the phone
is familiar and doesn't mess with the
established top-tier formula and that
was where smartphones at least a venetie
were headed with other companies trying
to do the same but in different ways
there was the honor magic too which was
also a slider there was the vivo necks
which made just the camera motorized and
then there was the Oppo find ex
which might have done all of the above
in the most stylish manner it's also
just a bit cooler in general because
that motorized top portion also does a
face unlock a feature that my me mix 3
stow hasn't gotten in a software update
I think that the me mix 3 is the most
well-rounded of all of these phones
especially due to its much lower price
than competing flag ships but I also
think the reason why I will always think
of this phone fondly is its Cole factor
sure you sacrifice waterproofing for a
unique design but personally I don't
really mind and having features tied to
the sliding mechanism just adds a little
more functionality to the established
formula but with the onslaught of hole
punch phones we're about to get this
season I can't help but feel a little
disappointed that we might not get
phones like this anymore the slider
simply had no time to get in more
people's hands and now the big brands
are going to start cutting holes in
their displays or they might just
straight-up start bending them for the
rest of the year so here's my question
many of you were excited to see this
phone after my hands-on and you might
have been excited to see the slider
design in general but do you think it's
gone all too soon and do you think the
hole punch phones will be as cool as
this or even the Oppo find X let's have
that discussion in the comment sections
down below as always thank you very much
for watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review this short issue review of the
Xiaomi me mix 3 I'm not trying to
disparage the fact that in 2019 we're
going to get phones that actually Bend
and the hole punch itself is actually
not all that bad but I do think that we
have room for phones like this for
manufacturers to actually get creative
with their designs and also to just make
them fun again but if there's one
takeaway that you can have here it's
that when things get a little bit weird
when it comes to the design of a phone
it could still be a really well
performing well-rounded flagship and
that's exactly what the Xiaomi me makes
3 is don't forget to subscribe to pocket
now for all of the best coverage
including the pocket now daily and of
course the pocket now weekly of which I
am a host you can also subscribe to my
channel if you want to see what I'm up
to and I did a couple of other pieces
with this phone there as well the links
are appearing right now and they're also
in the description down below you can
also drop some likes on these videos and
let us know what you think in the
comment sections once again as you
answer the questions that I posed in
this video and until the next one we're
gonna go ahead and just call it on this
one and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
