some manufacturing trouble the Nokia
Lumia icon gets confirmed killing years
of some crazy model numbers and Intel's
new plan to help you dual boot windows
and Android is on its works I'm hi Mary
vetta and can you imagine a bottle of
beer that could do a boot into a cup of
coffee the next day wishful thinking but
this is walking out daily Lester's day
off with some official news as Microsoft
has just published this official
statement it neyo and claiming that
windows phone is out so the iphone and
at least 24 markets which is great it's
great to see that the platform is
growing but the problem is that once you
start digging into which markets these
are you get to see that these are all
emerging markets where obviously the
iphone is ten times more expensive than
the Nokia Lumia 520 or 521 again it's
great to see if the platform is growing
it's just something that is not really
as big as they make it seem and speaking
of Windows Phone verizon has just
spilled the beans on the Nokia Lumia
icon and yeah this is pretty much the
first film that I remember that has a
name and not a number which is great
it's great to see evolution at least the
naming we're not sure why this is
happening this pretty much the Nokia
Lumia 929 that was rumoured recently
which is pretty much a 1520 only for
verizon a couple of changes there but
it's a great phone stay tuned as we are
expecting for the official announcement
you know now a company that's been
struggling pretty much for over a year's
bhuntu we filmed our hands on at CES
2013 and it's 2014 CS is over and we
still don't get any phones running a
boat to which was the promise canonical
just came on a Google hangout to tell
everybody to not worry they are actually
bringing a boom to on a lot of phones
from a certain OEM that they're not
specifying so hopefully we will be
getting this because it is a really cool
operating system and we want some
competition and another company that
seems to be struggling with building
something as Apple as we get more rumors
that they're struggling with the iWatch
this time because of leadership because
of production problems with the battery
with the display apparently they're
landing a lot of issues up to the player
Apple has actually changed the whole
leadership team from this project and
adding some other people in order to get
this happening it's not sure what to
expect we already got the new Gorilla
Glass 4
watches and everything so this is
something that we are expecting to
happen very soon we just don't know
exactly when stay tuned for that and
finally for the hot news of the date and
the intel has had a lot of trouble
trying to make some relevance in the
mobile market they just shown as their
strategy on how they're planning to do
it they showed us this a sous tablet
that's actually running windows and
android and they showed how that thing
can do a boot between operating systems
in four seconds which is actually
awesome it is really really good it's
probably the future they're planning to
make their mobile processors in the
future compatible with both operating
systems and that's the strategy which is
great we just hope that they make that
free as well as Android is free but
anyways that leads me to the question of
the day what Windows tablets be more
appealing to you or Android tablets for
that matter if they ran windows or
android the other way around leave us a
comment down below in my particular case
if they price them right because again
Android is free and they gave me the
option why not I'd love the option for
that and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video so mushy follow us on parking
out comment subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well you'll also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore be better
