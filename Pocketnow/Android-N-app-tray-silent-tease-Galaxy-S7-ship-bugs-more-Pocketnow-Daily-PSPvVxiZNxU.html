different it is from competitors google
has already begun teasing a version of
Android without an app tray and
Microsoft has already begun taking steps
toward a very expensive hololens future
I'm hi meri behna and if I would get a
dollar for every Bon Jovi song I've
heard on the street here I'd be a
millionaire this is parking out daily
the sort of official news today began
with Samsung as it seems that their
shipment crew is having some sort of
issues we hear of at least two customers
that have already received the galaxy s7
edge and we're still a couple of days
away from that having to start on March
11 it's great news for these people
hopefully that happens to a lot more
customers soon we can't wait to get some
coverage for you as soon as our review
units arrived in other official news
let's continue with Samsung the
company's advertisement has already
begun we know the company is legendary
in this department and we highly suggest
you hit the link in the description
watch these ads they are hilarious but
they're also kind of up to a point
Samsung really wants to show people how
different the Galaxy s7 is and they're
pointing out to the fact that it's the
only waterproof long lasting battery
life expandable storage phone out there
and while we kind of debate that we
can't wait to prove them either right or
wrong in a review as well now believe it
or not these are not the only hilarious
official news today Microsoft's
developer kit for the hollow lens is
already out developers can now get it
for the amazing amount of three thousand
dollars yes we know that that was going
to be the price tag but it's just
interesting that now that we know the
price tag for the HTC vive and
everything Microsoft is willing to
charge so much for a product that's
still not proven spill again hololens
and augmented reality is very different
to VR but my god just three thousand
dollars just completely defeats the
purpose obviously the consumer edition
might change in price tag but this seems
to be just another Google glass for now
and speaking of virtual reality google
has taken a step into making this more
serious today we see that the company
has now launched a new video
our section in the Google store now
selling you accessories that are focused
on the yard we've also seen the company
also deploying a certain applications
that are focused on cardboard we also
see Samsung doing the same thing both
companies are taking the steps necessary
to make this serious obviously the price
tag on these products and their
availability will make a big difference
going forward finally the very hot news
that they have to do with Google again
the company has just launched a new ad
on Twitter showing us the benefits of
google maps but people have not really
even cared about that part well people
have cared about is the fact that the ad
shows us a version of Android without an
app tray a lot of people are panicking
here because we have heard the rumors
that Android n will not include an app
tray google has responded to this they
have the told us that that we have
nothing to worry about it seems that the
purpose was the show maps and not
Australia the UI but hey it leads me to
the question of the day tell us do you
care about Google actually removing the
app tray from Android I know a lot of us
here at Pocket now don't care I mean
we've dealt with this with other you
eyes in the past but I know a lot of
people are looking a big deal out of it
particularly with what LG is doing with
the g5 so hey we would love to know your
opinion in the comments down below
