rumored to be showcased earlier than
expected mostly glass iphone nate is
being tipped to go back to stainless
steel and the LG G six might make a run
for the expected mwc announcement I'm
hina Rivera and forgive the tired mutt
face I was forced into a run today after
running yesterday this is parking out
daily the biggest problem with doing the
parking out daily and this time of the
year is the amount of rumors we get this
time we hear that Huawei might innovate
with the design of the p10 we've really
enjoyed the p9 mainly because of its
camera but not because if it's an
uninspired design we hear the p10 might
bring that same curve display of the
porsche design but we also hear that
there will also be a variant that does
not include the curves so stay tuned now
let's talk about the LG G 6lg is
desperate to make a comeback in the
smartphone world we do not understand
why the company understated the b20
being probably the best smartphone of
2016 we hear the g6 will ditch
modularity in addition it apparently
will be ready for an mwc announcement
apparently the device will also be ready
for our launch on March 10th we cannot
wait to see what we get I'm sorry about
Apple we've got a couple of rumors that
have to do with the feature of augmented
reality we heard some rumors earlier
that Apple was interested in doing this
but we thought that it was just
far-fetched and patents and everything
apparently the company is partnering
with carl zeiss for a product we don't
know exactly what they're planning but
it would make a lot of sense of the
world for Apple to move into a are given
all the popularity and the lack of
popularity of Pokemon go today and what
would a day like today be without iphone
8 rumors we have heard the glass on
glass design as a possibility but
apparently that's not it it seems that
stainless steel is making a comeback the
last time we saw a stainless steel
iphone it was with the iphone 4s some of
us really like the design we just didn't
really like how heavy it was so let's
see how the company plans to make this
iphone 8 not so heavy and bring all
these design elements and finally the
very hot news they have to do with the
samsung galaxy s 8 or should we say
rumors as we were hearing that samsung
might make a late launch
of the galaxy s a given all the problems
it had with the note 7 and the company
wanting to take its time apparently the
company is planning to make some sort of
an announcement at mwc and it's been
doing so since the galaxy s6 so it would
make all the sense in the world for the
company to do so at mwc but apparently
the launch is going to happen much later
even later than the g6 for reasons that
make a lot of sense as well the company
needs to take its time with this phone
we also hear rumors on the fact that
we're getting 8 gigabytes of RAM in
addition to no headphone jack anyways it
leads me to the question of the day
would you wait for the galaxy s 8 if
Samsung took its time or would you
consider buying any other phone that you
get earlier in my case ooh obviously I
will have to wait for the galaxy SI just
because of my job but if I had to do it
as a consumer I would see what LG comes
out with the g6 but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
if you want to get the news earlier

talking about calm and hit that

videos like this one and also follow me
