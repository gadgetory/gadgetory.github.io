but someday it might just save your life
I'm Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now
and here's a quick review of the AT&amp;amp;T
spare one emergency backup phone this
will be a quick review because there's
not a lot here to actually review now we
obsess over metrics like screen on time
and battery life but in an emergency how
long might your phone last if there's no
power can you get your phone recharged I
live in an earthquake prone state and we
keep emergency bags in each car as we
have medical equipment we need to keep
powered I've stocked those with
batteries solar chargers and a
hand-crank radio charger but even for us
if we need to quickly call 9-1-1 we
can't rightfully wait for the sun to
juice up our phone battery this is where
spare one comes into play this is a no
frills backup phone to help you quickly
contact your family or emergency
responders the set up is powered by a
pair of double-a batteries and those two
batteries are good for up to 10 hours of
talktime and up to 10 days of standby
time store the phone with an eight pack
of double a's and you could conceivably
keep it running for over a month
options on the spare one are pretty
simple we get a dialer pad hang up in
call buttons and a volume toggle which
cycles between the earpiece and a
speakerphone there's no screen for
information here but we do get some
fancy technologies an LED flashlight can
help you see things in the dark and
these holes here are perfect for a
lanyard or wrist strap okay that's a
joke but there is also a low-power GPS
receiver onboard and that ties into some
pretty cool server-side features when
you set up the phone you can create an
account with AT&amp;amp;T where you can
designate up to five Guardians and which
emergency services number you want to
use if you need to contact someone
specifically instead of just hitting 911
now pressing this red button here will
automatically dial that emergency number
and contact your Guardians via text and
email the GPS radio will track the
last-known position of the phone making
you easier to find if there's a problem
and all of this information is easily
managed through the account you set up
online the spare one costs $60 and has
its own special AT&amp;amp;T go phone plan
twenty-five dollars a year gives you one
hundred and twenty minutes of talk time
that's not bad for a year of backups
service and that includes the Guardian
contacts in GPS location but if you just
want something to make phone calls you
can always use the SIM card in your main
phone and spare one even has a little
slot to hold a nano to micro SIM card
adapter plus there's enough room in this
casing to keep a pin tool if your main
phone requires one it's a peace of mind
solution knowing you always have some
way of communicating or calling for help
you hope you'll never have to use it but
if you do need it at some point it'll be
sixty dollars well spent as always
