made 20 Pro and they are just as beastly
as rumors claimed we get some
predictions on Apple strategy of how the
iPhone 10 are will sell from a trusted
source and the Montblanc summit to is
the first ever where o a SmartWatch
sporting a Snapdragon wear 3100 I'm high
mattering that uh definitely feeling
really sad with a passing of Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen and pre-recording
because today is the Huawei made 20 pro
event this is firing out daily the
official news today began with deals
that are probably on sale because many
people don't care about them for any of
you are that are in the market for the
Google daydream view it's currently very
heavily discounted it depends on which
model if you want a last year's model
it's a nearly $60 off and then the one
from before that is nearly $70 pretty
much off you can learn more about it in
the description even if I I personally
don't really care now let's talk about
palm you guys remember that company and
if you don't don't worry I'm the old one
here the company has just announced the
phone that's designed to complement your
other phone it's a smaller version of
Android and it looks like a feature
phone but it's not and it has to connect
to your existing plan and you pay $10 a
month for it and I really don't
understand what the purpose of this
phone is palm did sort of furthest back
in the day they invented the PDA and
pretty much the modern smartphone to a
certain degree so I don't exactly
understand what the plan here is but you
can learn more about it in the
description you know that palm is now
owned by TCL so I'm still scratching my
head here now let's talk about the Mont
Blanc summit - it has now been announced
we saw it at the Snapdragon worth 3100
event I have been really looking forward
to this watch but it is not cheap at all
$1000 but you're getting you know a Mont
Blanc design in addition to one gig of
ram which is new for smartwatches eight
gigs of storage and definitely the new
processor that claims amazing
performance you can learn more about it
in our video in the description and now
let's make an interruption from all the
official news to talk about the strategy
for the eye
ten are make she quotes just chimed then
apparently this phone is going to break
records 38 million units in the holiday
season according to rumors and then it
seems that it's gonna continue
outselling for the beginning of the
following year it's very hard to predict
if this is going to happen or not but
obviously he is the expert so up let's
see in the end this is going to end up
happening that way
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Huawei made 20 and made
20 Pro link in the description to our
full hands-on video yes I begin this
video by claiming that this device is a
beast and it kind of is this is actually
one of the first times in a very long
time where I've been sitting in a
presentation and where I'm like wow like
wow like yeah like it does that too
because oh my god it's very hard for
smartphones as a price lately sure
they've got great cameras and a lot of
things but then you've got a device
that's got an even greater camera that's
got even greater capabilities and that
looks beautiful our unit it's already in
definitely let us know in the comments
where you like for us to be testing and
let us know what you think do you like
them 8:20 a.m. 8:20 Pro or not because
in my case mate 20 Pro is definitely my
favorite so far
