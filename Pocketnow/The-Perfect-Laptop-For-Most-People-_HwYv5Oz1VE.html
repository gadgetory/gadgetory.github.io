use multiple monitors to get work done I
use Windows and it's been that way for a
very long time but when it comes to a
laptop even though there are great
options from huawei Microsoft and others
for me it has to be a MacBook when it
comes to the nuances that makes a laptop
great it's really hard to beat the
MacBook Air and I think that for most
people the MacBook Air is the perfect
laptop and in this video I'm going to
tell you why the hardware on the MacBook
Air is amazing I know some might call
garish but I really like this gold color
because it is different personalities in
different light sometimes it looks gold
sometimes it looks a little bit red
sometimes it looks a little brown if you
want a more traditional option you can
choose silver or Space Gray but I think
those are a little bit boring the
MacBook Air weighs just 2.7 pounds
making it one of the lightest laptops
that you can buy and it's really thin
too making it so portable whether you're
traveling with it or just using around
the house the new display on the MacBook
Air is so much better than previous
generations it's finally high resolution
enough so that you don't see pixels on
the screen plus it's got great color
accuracy deep blacks awesome viewing
angles it's just a massive upgrade over
MacBook Airs of the past below the
screen is an updated butterfly keyboard
which like previous butterfly keyboards
have very short key travel some people
love it some people hate it personally I
like it because it requires less effort
to type because the key travel is
smaller just my personal preference the
trackpad on the new MacBook Air is
glorious it's significantly bigger than
previous MacBook Airs
plus it has forced touch so that you can
press anywhere on the trackpad to get it
to register a click if you use gestures
in Mac OS which have gotten really good
using such a large trackpad makes it
really easy to use for finger gestures
and three finger gestures and all the
cool stuff that you can do on a Mac in
the upper right corner of the keyboard
is a touch ID sensor which works as
great as it does on the older iPhones
that had the touch ID sensor it's great
to not have to type your password when
getting into your MacBook and use it for
Apple pay and any other place you need
authentication
I kind of wish there was face ID here
too but what can you expect the MacBook
Air has a low-power Core i5 processor
and for most people it's going to be
enough for me I use a lot of Chrome
Photoshop and Office and it keeps up
just fine if you're going to be using
your MacBook Air for heavy video editing
or photo editing it might not be the
best solution especially since it has
integrated graphics although you can
connect an e GPU if you want to one of
the two USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports so yes
with the new MacBook Air you're going to
be livin the dongle life because there
are only two ports but at least you get
a headphone jack the included 30 watt
charger can charge the 50 watt hour
battery on the MacBook Air in a few
hours
apple claims that you can get 12 hours
of web browsing on the MacBook Air but
in my usage I didn't find that to be the
case probably because I'm using Chrome
and not Safari my usage had about 3 to 5
hours of battery life usually closer to
that 5 using Chrome and the apps that I
use the MacBook Air starts at 1,200
bucks
and goes up to $1,400 for a higher
capacity model this is definitely more
expensive than other competing laptops
and you're definitely paying an Apple
tax here but I think that for most
people the MacBook Air represents really
the perfect laptop that's just a great
all-rounder it's thin and light and
quick and has great battery life what do
you think about the MacBook Air drop a
comment and let us know please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw you can follow me on twitter at
