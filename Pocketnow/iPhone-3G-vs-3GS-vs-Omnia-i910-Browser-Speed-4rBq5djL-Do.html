pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
compare browser speed rendering between
the iPhone 3G the iPhone 3GS and the
Verizon omnia I 9/10 for this test we're
going to use Wi-Fi so we won't have any
issues with the cellular networks the
iPhone 3GS is a 600 megahertz unit as
well as the omnia I 9/10 which also is
rated at 600 megahertz while the iPhone
3G is a 400 megahertz unit so I expect
that one to be slower you can find many
comparisons of the 3G in the 3G s on
YouTube but I thought it would be
interesting to compare it to the windows
mobile device but first we will do the
3G to 3GS comparison by using a mobile
site MDOT cnn.com
so we'll first bring up the Safari
Browser get a new page up and I'll type
in MDOT cnn.com you'll also notice that
the 3GS screen does seem a little dimmer
than the 3G and that's mostly due to the
yellow or tint
that's exhibited on the 3GS so I don't
know if this is something Apple is going
to fix but I'm pretty sure I have my
settings for brightness at the middle
and they also could have had the
brightness recalibrated so let's try it
now one two three go
and you can see the rendering of the 3GS
is almost instantaneously it's a quite
impressive display so now we're going to
take the 3G out of the mix
and pair the 3GS to the Anya I 9/10 the
omnia from Verizon comes with opera 9.5
I also want to mention that I am using
OS 3.0 on both 3G and the 3GS so we're
gonna bring up the browser and I'll type
in m dot cnn.com and switching keyboards
and really devices that the sensitivity
of the screens are quite different
between the omnia in the iPhone but once
you get used to either I don't think
it's a it's an issue there again I think
you see that the omnia is quite a bit
brighter than the 3GS something I
definitely have to look at in terms of
adjustments or is it something that
Apple has to fix with a tweak of their
graphics chip so we'll get rid of that
page Oh
remove that page ask for a new page then
type in m dot cnn.com
and then we're ready to go so make sure
I'm all set here
one two three go and you can see it's
the 3GS there's just no comparison I
mean Apple did a great job of optimizing
the rendering speed and you can also see
that the the pages are different the
mobile site for the iPhone is probably
optimized for the iPhone versus the
windows mobile site which is optimized
for mobile browsers in general not
specific to any device but that's the
speed test and something for the windows
mobile OAM manufacturers to ponder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
