pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
compare browser speed rendering between
the iphone 3g the iphone 3gs n the
verizon omnia i-94 this test we're going
to use Wi-Fi so we won't have any issues
with the cellular networks the iphone
3gs is a 600 megahertz unit as well as
the omnia I 19 which also is rated at
600 megahertz while the iphone 3g is a
400 megahertz unit so i expect that one
to be slower you can find many
comparisons of the 3g in the 3gs on
youtube but i thought it would be
interesting to compare it to the windows
mobile device but first we will do the
3g to 3gs comparison by using a mobile
site MDOT cnn.com so we'll first bring
up the safari browser get a new page up
and i'll type in EM cnn.com you'll also
notice that the 3gs screen does seem a
little dimmer than the 3g and that's
mostly due to the yellow or tint that's
exhibited on the 3gs so i don't know if
this is something Apple is going to fix
but i'm pretty sure i have my settings
for brightness at the middle and they
also could have had the brightness
recalibrated so let's try it now one two
three go and you can see the rendering
of the 3gs is almost instantaneously
it's a quite impressive
display so now we're going to take the
3g out of the mix and pair the 3gs to
the Anya I 9-10 the omnia from verizon
comes with the opera 9.5 i also want to
mention that i am using OS 3.0 on both
3g and the 3gs so we're going to bring
up the browser and i'll type in a.m
cnn.com and switching keyboards and
really devices that the sensitivity of
the screens are quite different between
the omnia in the iphone but once you get
used to either i don't think it's it's
an issue there again i think you see
that the omnia is quite a bit brighter
than the 3gs something I definitely have
to look at in terms of adjustments or is
it something that Apple has to fix with
a tweak of their graphics chip so we'll
get rid of that page Oh remove that page
ask for a new page then type in m dot
cnn.com
and then we're ready to go so make sure
I'm all set here one two three go and
you can see it's the 3gs there's just no
comparison I mean Apple did a great job
of optimizing the rendering speed and
you can also see that the the pages are
different the mobile site for the iphone
is probably optimized for the iphone
versus the windows mobile site which is
optimized for mobile browsers in general
not specific to any device but that's
the speed test and something for the
windows mobile OEM manufacturers to
ponder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
