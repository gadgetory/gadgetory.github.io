and we're going to take a look at how
Windows Mobile works with a wireless car
stereo here we have the clarion FB 275
BTS installed and up here is my HTC
touch diamond
it's connected via bluetooth see our
icon right here and so if I press this
button twice what is my next appointment
in 40 minutes
Hawaiian stereo video so that that was a
voice command and I activated it with
the car stereos buttons and it played
through my car stereo speakers so I
could hear everything there now I can
also receive calls and it will tell me
who's calling
let's see how this works
I'm going to make a call
every night high performance the RAM is
planes to my stereo and I can hear the
number of the caller calling I can hang
up by pressing it
so that that's pretty nice and now what
about music now the same with this this
does support the advanced audio
distribution profile however it does not
Auto connect so I have to go into my
Bluetooth settings every time I get into
the car I have to do this
I have to set the stereo as wireless
audio so now when I do that
now I have wireless music playing
through the stereo and right here I have
forward and back buttons and I can press
this to pause so see we're playing
another song for us to pause press to
play again go to the next track you see
just changes right right there really
nice now another thing with let me pause
that another thing with this is we can
also do my GPS navigation program so
here it is launching TomTom and since
TomTom has voice prompts it will
broadcast that through the car stereo
audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
