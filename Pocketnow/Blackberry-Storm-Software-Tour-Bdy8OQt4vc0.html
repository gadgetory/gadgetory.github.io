guest editor for pocketnow.com I'm going
to walk you through the software on the
just-released rim blackberry storm give
you a sense of what it's like to own the
device I'm going to take you through the
browser the media player contacts mail
messages really take you step-by-step
through the device and hopefully help
you decide if it's right for you or not
so let's stick around and joy and I'll
see you in the next video bye so we turn
the device on you're greeted by a very
simple and elegant home screen with the
date featured prominently in the middle
battery indicator in the upper left on
the right side you've got your signal
strength and conveniently located right
below the battery indicator is a profile
switcher so the bulk of the screen is
taken up by these two rows which are
shortcut keys which consists of two rows
of four you can configure these for
anything that you'd like you can even
had a third row if you choose so we'll
go ahead and hit the blackberry button
here and take you to the main menu so
you can set these order any way you like
but here's what they are for me I've got
to email icons SMS and text contacts
calendar browser full visual voicemail
sounds options messages Verizon's
proprietary navigation system which
supports the built-in GPS chip in the
storm instant messaging applications
games download setup help search music
manage contacts lock and turn device off
so some of the stuff you guys are
definitely going to want to see and want
to know about say it's calendar for the
business users out there and you're
greeted by a very typical blackberry
calendar things that you're used to on
the Pearl the curve and some of you at
the bold you can view by date and you
can tap the day you want to see click it
and publicity your appointments very
nice very simple typical blackberry so
we'll go ahead and go back to the main
screen here and the browser is one of
the biggest selling points of the storm
so let me go ahead and demonstrate that
for you I have it already queued up to
pocketnow.com now when you scroll
through it is very smooth scrolling but
it's not flick scrolling meaning when
you take your finger off it stops right
where you are
this is true for contacts and for most
of the applications in the menus through
the storm well it is a nice silky
transition again we take your finger off
it's going to stop so some people like
that some may not for zooming you've got
two options you can get a double tap and
let sue min for you or down at the
bottom you've got a minus and a plus
magnifying glass similar to what's on
the t-mobile g1 and you can zoom in or
zoom out doing that as well and this is
a full HTML capable browser based on the
same webkit browser that the iphone uses
and it's very full-featured and very
robust and I've been relatively
impressed with it although at this point
it does not support flash so let's go
back here and one thing I should mention
about the browser as well is that it
does not support tabbed internet
browsing which I wish it did not so bad
and if you want to type in a web page at
www and you can type in what you like
right there has all of your bookmarks
and your history right below it so the
next thing is it's got a full visual
voicemail very similar to what's found
on apple iphone and a verizon has rolled
this out on a few other devices
essentially what that means instead of
seeing an indicator showing the you have
one or two voicemails this will actually
tell you who the voicemails are from you
can select and pick what you want to
play as well as a status bar across the
bottom lets you fast forward to
different points in the voicemails very
handy if something i really enjoyed on
the storm next thing you've got sounds
did you change your profiles from ring
to vibrate options your typical
blackberry options nothing at any
ordinary here and it works with the
scrolling like i said before not flick
scrolling so when you take your finger
off it stops go back here you've got
messages very certificate or messages
push capabilities setting up and email
is very easy all you need to do is type
in your email address and your password
and they will take care of the rest for
you it makes it a very nice and simple
transition VZ navigator verizon's
proprietary navigation system for
turn-by-turn directions which are very
nice media this is a very full-featured
media phone as well so I'm go ahead and
show you some of the cool things that
it's got for it
so the first one it's got music it's got
a full music player and it's broken up
by music songs artists albums drawn
around playlists so go ahead and play a
sample song for you and you can fill it
up as much as you want to the 8
gigabytes built in micro SD card here's
a demo takes a second to load up as you
can hear the speakers are quite loud and
those speakers are coming from the
bottom right there that's bigger grow
very loud so when accelerometer kicked
in there and close that up all right
let's go back next even have is videos
and the screen on on the storm is
fantastic and really makes videos pop so
I'm going to show you a quick clip here
they included a trailer for the movie
babylon ad for better or worse so go
ahead and play that for you can see what
video looks like on the storm
so please video quite well and quite
loudly again really the video pops on
this if you want to watch a movie on an
airplane will not be a problem it's got
a gorgeous gorgeous screen so let's go
back here ringtones select all your
ringtones right there and you can set
them for any contact you choose it's got
a very nice picture of you are two years
I'm go ahead and show you that sample
pictures and any pictures that you take
using the built-in 3.2 megapixel
autofocus and camera will show up here
as well and any videos you take using
that same camera will show up in the
video selection it also has a built-in
flash and self portrait mirror so put an
open a picture and you can flick from
picture the next using your finger very
nice and easy if you want to zoom in
just like a webpage and DoubleTap it and
notice when I double tap I'm not
depressing the screen I'm just making
very light contact and you can scroll
around to that same way very cool we'll
go back and using the built-in
microphone keep going back here you can
record voice notes very handy feature
and something I've actually used quite
frequently remember to pick up milk
record it I can forget to pick up your
milk so let's go back to the home screen
I will keep going camera stick simple
camera controls I'll show you that very
quickly very similar to what you'll find
on the pearl or the curve close out of
that clock it's like alarm clock and
control the clock same top applications
this does have an application store
which is quite handy so right now it's
not that populate it just has free apps
in here but it will have some pay apps
as it beginning continues to develop
it's got facebook some windows live
messenger or google talk nothing else
revolutionary and there but it is nice
that they do have a built-in application
center and i should notice that this is
completely over the air for more
upgradable so meaning as the device
matures rim can push out new features or
stability upgrades you can download
right over the bill
video network instant messaging it comes
out of the box equipped with windows
live messenger yahoo messenger google
talk AOL instant messenger and
blackberries fantastic blackberry
messenger as we continue to scroll down
here applications does come with a bevy
of applications tasks calendar a full
microsoft word sweet meeting you can
create or edit any microsoft office
documents so you've got word to go sheet
to go which is excel and powerpoint to
go which they call slideshow to go
another control for your video camera
another control for voice notes voice
dialing which does not need to be
trained it automatically will recognize
your voice which is very handy I've
always been a fan of the voice dialing
in the blackberries password keeper and
some saved messages games comes a two
built-in games the old blackberry staple
brick breaker which I used to love to
play on my old pearl I want to show you
what that looks like because it is very
cool how they did it so instead of using
the trackball to control you know can
use your finger into the touch screen to
put your finger in there and it
highlights as you move around it's a
very cool take on an old classic and
it's very reliable and it's very stable
and quick and makes using brickbreaker
even more fun than it was before limp
close out of there includes a game
called word moles well it's a word
stretching game downloads well your
downloads will go set up gives you very
quick easy setup for setting up your
email Bluetooth nice and quick and
painless help search another control for
your music manager connections and
locking the device so if since this is a
touchscreen and does not have a tactile
keyboard I want to show you guys how the
keyboards function here so let me go
ahead and go to messages go to SMS and I
will create a new message here
alright I've got a new message ready to
go and as you can see that this is in
landscape I'm sorry in portrait mode and
you've got a shirt type qwerty keyboard
very I'd actually identical to what's
found on the current pearl but it's very
quick and easy to use and as you put
your finger over it you get a blue color
lets you know which key are on so I'm
going to go ahead and type my name is
John
so recognize it's a new name is John but
not too bad it learns what you type and
we'll get more accurate as you go one
fantastic thing about the blackberry
storm is it does support multitouch so
copy and paste and such are nice and
easy so what you do for copy and paste
you hold your finger down take your
other finger it can select the text
actually very nice and comes relatively
intuitive and you can select cop cut
copy and paste now if you want to type
in full landscape mode take care of
advantage of the accelerometer and
you've got a full landscape keyboard so
I'll type the same thing hello my name
is John and you'll notice again as you
move your finger over the letters you
get that blue glow now that is a little
harder to see which letter your finger
is on top of but it's not bad so I'll go
ahead and type that for you let's see
how that works out
so not quite so accurate there but not
too bad I think it's something that you
would get used to the more you use the
device I've only had it for a few days
but I feel after a few weeks it would
become intuitive and second nature and
it highlights as you put your finger
over and it clicks actually push the
screen down and I should mention again
that the screen pushing down is nothing
revolutionary I was expecting something
that would transcend mobile phones in a
really unique experience it ends up
feeling identical to the new trackpads
found on the macbooks and macbook pros I
really enjoy actually the screen pushing
down well it's not revolutionary I found
it became very intuitive something I
started to enjoy to use and missed it
when I was using my other mobile phones
something to keep in mind so the
accelerometer is like I showed you here
a very nice feature but it can be a
little bit laggy so I'll show you here
takes a second to turn so one thing
about the blackberry is the operating
system that's on it was initially
developed for non touch screen devices
such as the blackberry bold the curve
the Pearl and others it was actually
adapted for touchscreen meaning it
wasn't built for this platform well it
does work nice it is a little bit laggy
and it can be a little bit slow I think
it's something that RIM will fix with
software upgrade so I'm not terribly
concerned about it but something to keep
in mind i'll show you another example
that when i hit the blackberry button
there's about a second delay it's
nothing terribly long but if using the
device a lot and it's leping a lot of
options you will certainly notice it so
