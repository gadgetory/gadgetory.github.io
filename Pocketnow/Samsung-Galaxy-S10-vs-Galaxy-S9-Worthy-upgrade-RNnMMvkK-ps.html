question on one end we have the most
powerful Samsung Galaxy of 2019 and on
the other we have its direct predecessor
with all the heavy discounts you can
find right now it is a good question
should you keep what you have or upgrade
to the new I'm hey I'm going to be
better with pocket now and this is
Galaxy S 10 plus vs. galaxy s 9 plus
brought to you by D brand I've spent the
last four years comparing old galaxies
to new ones and being like math it's not
really worth an upgrade but I think that
Samsung noticed that they noticed that
the Galaxy S 9 didn't really sell well
so for this year things have changed
dramatically at a glance I find the
Galaxy S tend to look more like the note
9 than anything with sharper corners and
the horizontal arrangement of the
cameras the s9 plus is actually one
millimeter taller and nearly a
millimeter thicker and get this 14 grams
heavier yes 14 the s10 plus is just a
millimeter thicker and that's about it
so imagine the smaller and lighter
footprint of the new galaxy and max it
with a larger six point four inch
display versus a six point two this is
also a new dynamic AMOLED with even more
natural color reproduction a smarter
approach to avoid blue light and HDR 10
plus support the only one of the galaxy
has nine plus is that it's more
symmetrical in its approach with the
bezels at the top of the bottom but this
whole trend of fun wallpapers for the
s10 plus is it maybe really fond of the
hole punch believe it or not plus also
has louder speakers I don't have a
scientific number to prove that but I
love its quality and depth when compared
to the s9 internally the galaxy s 10
plus wins with a more powerful and
efficient Wacom Snapdragon 855 versus
the 845 more ram double the starting
storage a 15% larger battery reversible
she wireless charging a better Gorilla
Glass faster LTE and yeah you get the
picture it's not just the newer phone
but it also includes a lot more in the
now when you jump at the software the
differences died down both devices run
on one UI on top of Android 9pi and
they're pretty much the same this is one
of those cases where it seems that
Samsung didn't shortchange last year's
model on features and that's fair given
how long the phone took to get the
update some people complain about the
size of the icons but I found it really
easy to reduce their size and pretty
much mimicked the way things looked
before full screen gestures work on both
and I love how flexible Samsung is being
about it like seriously I've got nothing
to complain about here navigation feels
fluid you can switch off bixby home to
make it even more fluid and no worries
you can remap the bixby key on both
devices just as well I do wish we didn't
have all the extra applications that
Samsung has over Google's on both but at
least you get the variety or you can
disable whichever apps you don't want
the Galaxy S 10 plus is also proven to
be better when it comes to battery life
not by a significant margin you can end
the day with both with the s9 plus in
the feelings while the s10 plus will
have twenty to thirty percent more
depending on your use one thing that I
will tell you that I missed from last
year's model is the fingerprint scanner
I consider it to be a little more
reliable and I also missed the iris
scanner even if it wasn't great at least
I knew that I could rely on a more
secure way to unlock my phone whereas in
the case of the SN plus that's not
necessarily what you get the camera
conversation is where things take an
interesting twist see technically both
the primary and the telephoto camera on
these devices is the same at least in
specification z' where things change in
the s10 plus is having an added
wide-angle camera and a better selfie
camera in addition to a depth sensor
resulting photos during they look very
similar I do notice scene optimization
on the s10 to do a better job in certain
scenarios but the improvements aren't
really what I would call significant
where the s10 just beats the pants off
the s9 plus is in the versatility of the
wide-angle you can get such epic
photography from it
this wide-angle also allows for better
portrait photos you don't have to step
back to get the shot on the s10 as
opposed to the crop on the s9 plus and
then in selfie photos given the added
megapixels on the def sensor on the s10
plus you will notice better results than
the s9 even if dynamic range seems to be
good on both devices regardless now the
wide-angle camera also plays a major
role in video with the s10 providing
super steady movement at a wider crop
than the s9 plus and also file sizes are
now more efficient with its support of
HEV see I'm also going to praise selfie
video on the SN Plus given the wider
crop and also 4k video finally being
supported and before we reach our
conclusion let me tell you about today's
sponsor D brand if you want to avoid
those fingerprint smudges and pimp out
your new Galaxy S 10 plus or last year's
Galaxy S 9 + D brands new swarm skin is
fantastic and of course that's just one
of many options they have available to
cater to your tastes follow the link of
the description below to choose the skin
that matches your style most to conclude
I think that the theme of this video is
noticeable with the exception of
software and absolutely everything else
the galaxy s 10 plus is almost what I
would call a far better phone than the S
9 plus we've got a better display better
specifications a more versatile camera
and all packaged in a slightly more
compact device usually I've spent these
comparisons telling you that it might
not be worth it to upgrade but that's
not the case here the galaxy s 10 plus
doesn't feel like an iteration Samsung
has really raised the bar with this
phone and things that compel me to tell
you that it might be time for you to
sell your old phone and give this new
one a try let us know what you think
about the galaxy s 10 plus and the
galaxy s 9 plus which one would you pick
