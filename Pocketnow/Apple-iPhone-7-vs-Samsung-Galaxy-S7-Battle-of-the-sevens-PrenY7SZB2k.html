tablet please visit D brand calm both
Samsung and Apple are hoping consumers
will part with their hard-earned cash
for a lucky number seven now playing
with the latest iPhone it's time for a
grudge match between the smaller
offerings from each manufacturer looking
at the specs on paper between iOS and
Android phones is never really a true
oranges to oranges comparison but you
can pause the video here to see which of
these numbers matter most to you with
that out of the way moving on to design
the new color options for Apple this
season are two flavors of black will be
spending time with the matte black
iPhone mostly because I'm not a fan of
glossy back devices I really do like the
look of this new iPhone especially for
these matching antenna bands Samsung has
done a terrific job of refining the look
of the galaxy over these last two years
and the s7 stands is one of the most
attractive devices of the year it'll be
a personal preference whether people
gravitate towards a metal or glass phone
body but between these two in front of
us it is kind of funny that they both
show off fingerprints we can already see
the comments below this video that both
will just live in cases so why should it
matter if they're beautifully designed
phones moving over to the screens
Samsung shots up an easy victory for the
display this year not only a higher
resolution and a brighter outdoor auto
mode this AMOLED panel delivers
wonderful saturation and contrast and
for purists switching the display to
basic mode provides one of the most
color accurate screens available on any
mobile gadget it should also be
mentioned that even though we have a
larger screen on the galaxy the s7
doesn't feel that much bigger than the
iPhone 7 maybe one advantage for the
iPhone the home button is slightly
easier to reach for folks with smaller
hands speaking of those home buttons
Apple removing the actual button and
relying on four sensors will hopefully
improve on what's historically been one
of the more common failure areas for the
iPhone and we're confident this button
will aged better than the easily
scratched home button on the Galaxy
taking a look at cameras the iPhone 7 is
nicely improved faster autofocus
performance a wider aperture and optical
image stabilization all add up to a
better performing shooter but we still
need to give the overall win to Samsung
the galaxy's focusing system
is second-to-none and insanely quick the
larger image sensor helps eke out a win
in lower light situations and the app to
control the camera is better organized
with more options for folks of all
photography skill levels where Apple
still holds a clear lead is with HDR
processing and slow motion video though
we are disappointed to see that the
iPhone still can't record stereo audio
when shooting video and I hate selfie
cameras but these two are a split
decision when shooting stills we like
the look of this new iPhone camera
Samsung has the wider field of view but
is more prone to washing out your shot
and blurring details for video we'll
give Samsung the nod the iPhone finally
produces 1080p video from the front
camera but Samsung has been producing
quad HD video from the front camera
since the galaxy note 4 the flipside to
the multimedia debate is audio
performance if Samsung slacked off
anywhere it was with headphone and
speaker playback the iPhone stereo
speakers helped fill in a wider range
and are louder than the single bottom
firing galaxy speaker we're not
particularly fans of Apple strategy to
remove the headphone jack but even
through an adapter the iPhone provides a
more powerful amp to drive your
headphones the Galaxy will properly
playback 24-bit audio files but output
is upper mid pack at best a bug phones
now future water resistance with a
slight edge going to Samsung with ip68
certification over Apple's ip67 rating
though in real world use how people
might damage their phones we don't know
that there is a clear advantage for
either device context is key and say you
dropped both phones on their backs in a
rocky Lake the iPhone would likely
survive that better as any crack in the
galaxy glass would likely reduce the
effectiveness of Samsung's water sealing
and this brings us to battery life the
iPhone 7 battery is larger than the
iPhone 6s but in refining our battery
benchmark it can't outperform the galaxy
s7 streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the six month old
galaxy s7 drained 6% of its battery
while the iPhone 7 drained 7% these
numbers look a little different than the
tests we ran on the iPhone 6s and that's
because we used to only set phones to
50% brightness hitting 190 Lux runs
the iPhone screen brighter than
positioning the brightness slider
halfway both phones actually do a better
than average job of hanging through
moderate use days and getting us to
dinnertime with a little juice to spare
but for those times you need to top off
during the day the galaxy also wins that
race even though it has a 50% larger
battery than the iPhone Samsung claims
the s Evan can charge up to 60 percent
in 30 minutes but we've never gotten
close to that on our Qualcomm powered
galaxy the best we've managed in that
time is around a 35 percent charge but
that still handily bests the iPhone 7
which only managed a 26 percent charge
when connected to the included charger
for a half hour it's a shame that first
power efficiency Apple doesn't include a
faster charger with the phone that's
expensive so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us between the iPhone 7 and
the galaxy s7 well obviously when
comparing these two phones
the clear winner is the LG B 20 I kid I
kid but seriously these two phones seem
almost perfectly designed in
laboratories to battle each other Apple
executives might act like the iPhone is
incomparable to other devices but the
iPhone 7 takes a large step in closing
the gap on lifestyle features we enjoy
like water resistance and camera
stabilization and it's fair to say that
Samsung is drawn its fair share of
inspiration from Cupertino over the
years - outside of an individual's
preference between Android or iOS if you
really twisted our arms here at pocket
now we'd likely give a subtle edge to
the galaxy s7 in this comparison camera
is formidable and when staring at a
phone screen all day
Samsung has a nicer display to gaze upon
however much that might mean one device
wins over another we'll leave that up to
you guys to debate down in the comments
and of course we do want to hear from
