Android version 3 was the worst
operating system of all time maybe even
worse than Windows ME millennium edition
I have honeycomb running here on some
pretty interesting and experimental
hardware the sony vaio tablet p i'm
brand a minimun and in this video i want
to revisit why honeycomb was so bad and
why it causes Google to mostly abandon
their tablet efforts and so let's take a
look at the hardware on the sony vaio
tablet p as you can see it's a clamshell
design which is actually pretty smart
because inside you get two 5.5 inch
displays so in effect you get a large
screen and a footprint that allows you
to put the device into your pocket back
in 2011 when this device came out
tablets were big like ipad dig so
portability really wasn't possible with
a tablet the sony vaio tablet be made it
possible to get a big screen in a small
form-factor a small footprint something
that could fit inside of your pocket or
your back unfortunately you get big
black border between the screens so it's
not a continuous large display in terms
of specifications the sony vaio tablet p
has an NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core CPU it
also had one gigabyte of RAM and 4
gigabytes of expandable storage plus it
had an embedded SIM card in this case on
AT&amp;amp;T where you could get AT&amp;amp;T 3G the
battery is around 3000 milliamp hours
and charges with a proprietary barrel
Charter and the standby battery life on
this device isn't really that good this
was when Android really wasn't optimized
like it is today for battery life and
standby battery life the UI of honeycomb
is an early version of Google's holo UI
which we saw an Ice Cream Sandwich
Android version 4 on phones but in
honeycomb it just wasn't ready it was a
combination of black and blue colors and
weird fonts that were just difficult to
read in honeycomb certain parts of the
OS like the app drawer were bright white
for some reason and then there were the
apps even Google's own apps look like
blown up phone apps and not to pain you
eyes like we saw on the iPad since
developers never thought Google is
serious about tablets if you updated
their apps to take advantage of the
bigger screens by far the worst part of
honeycomb was its performance whether
dual-core quad-core whether 2 gigs of
ram with three gigs of ram honeycomb
device it had such poor performance to
almost be completely unusable scrolling
was choppy multitasking was terrible
even the launcher seemed unfinished and
just terrible this was long before
Android 4.2 jellybean came around with
project butter to allow Android to run
any consistent 60 frames per second
overall Google really abandoned their
tablet efforts after honeycomb they
really didn't do much I think that they
just realized that phones were getting
bigger and people really wouldn't have
such a need for two devices like they
might have back when phones were about
four inches which is kind of a small
screen now phones have six inch screens
six and a half inch screens and you
really don't need to have two devices
plus if you want the best tablet
experience you're just gonna get an iPad
for being honest about it but as far as
Android goes they missed the boat
probably because honeycomb was just such
a bad first impression of what a Android
tablet experience would be like so I
hope you enjoyed this video let me know
in the comments if you agree or disagree
that honeycomb was one of if not the
worst operating system of all time and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
