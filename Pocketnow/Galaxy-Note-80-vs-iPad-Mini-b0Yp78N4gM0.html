dominated the tablet market but now it
has some serious competition on Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Apple iPad Mini versus
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 in the
tablet market Apple has largely ruled
the plane but over the last year thanks
to several high-end Android tablets with
highly competitive price tags Android
OMS have started to make some headway in
the tablet realm cutting into apples
significant market share lead and slowly
bringing Android tablets into the
mainstream one of the few manufacturers
bringing Android tablets up to speed is
unsurprisingly Samsung it's Galaxy Tab
line is relatively successful but the
brand that's truly turning heads is the
Galaxy Note lineup thanks to the added
utility of the s-pen at Mobile World
Congress in February Samsung announced
one addition to the Galaxy Note lineup
the Galaxy Note 8.0 boasting high-end
specifications and a hoard of software
features that set it apart from the
competition but how does samsung's
latest mid sized tablet fare against its
toughest competitor Apple's wildly
popular iPad Mini surprisingly well the
first matters are hardware and design
both in which Apple's mid sized tablet
win by a wide margin the iPad minis
design is not unlike that of the iPhone
5 that shell is made of anodized
aluminum making it both feel great in
the hand and relatively durable not to
mention it feels extremely lightweight
for a 7.9 inch device its buttons are
solid the design is minimal and there is
almost no bezel on the sides it's not
that the Galaxy Note 8.0 is hardware is
bad but it's unmoving like virtually
every other galaxy device from Samsung
the Note 8.0 is made almost entirely of
plastic and it shares the same mundane
design as all its siblings wide radius
corners lightweight plastic and faux
brushed metal trim along the edges in
fact it's practically a much larger
Galaxy s4 with an S Pen the Note 8.0 is
also larger than the iPad Mini in all
dimensions it's taller by 10.8
millimeters wider by 1.2 millimeters and
thicker by 0.8 millimeters it's also 30
grams heavier and has a point one inch
larger display yet features much more
bezel on the sides the
part of the note 8.0 s design however is
the inclusion of a camera hump around
back on a device as large as the note
8.0 there's no excuse for a notable
camera hump one because the rear camera
is not a notable feature and two because
there are thinner smartphones with
larger sensors and no camera hump both
devices are geared towards consumers
seeking a powerful ultra portable device
with a large display and both Samsung
and Apple succeed Apple simply does it
with more class once you look under the
hood however it's apparent where apples
and Samsung's priorities lie the Galaxy
Note 8.0 may not be as pretty as the
iPad Mini it may not be a small light
weight or nearly bezel 'less but it's
packed with raw horsepower whereas the
iPad Mini is much more conservative the
note 8.0 has a distinct advantage in
terms of specifications granted the iPad
Mini doesn't need a ton of horsepower to
run smoothly the Galaxy Note 8.0 comes
with a 1.6 gigahertz quad core Exynos
chip set 2 gigabytes of RAM either 16 or
32 gigabytes of built-in storage a micro
SD card slot for expansion 5 megapixel
rear camera 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera and a 4,600 milliamp hour battery
they I've had many features a 1
gigahertz dual-core a5 chip 512
megabytes of RAM 16 32 or 64 gigabytes
of built-in storage a 5 megapixel camera
around back
1.2 megapixel camera on the front and a
16-point 3 watt hour battery on tablets
displays are generally make-or-break
features unfortunately in the mid-sized
sector no tablet has a killer display
both the iPad Mini and the Galaxy Note
8.0 feature mediocre displays the Note
8.0 display measures 8 inches diagonally
and sports a resolution of 1280 by 800
pixels for a density of 189 pixels per
inch the iPad minis display measures
seven point nine inches with a
resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels or 162
pixels per inch the Note 8.0 has a
distinct advantage in sharpness and
saturation but make no mistake
both of these displays will be rather
disappointing next to the ultra high
density display on your smartphone
pixelation can be viewed from a distance
and although viewing angles are fine the
contrast and color reproduction is
paltry compared to other displays
between the note 8.0 and the iPad Mini
when it comes to hardware design and
specifications it's a toss-up you're
either looking at a device that's
gorgeous but conservative in
specifications or a device that's not
nearly as polished made of cheap
materials but packed with top-notch
specs when it comes to tablets though
software plays a major role in the
usefulness of a device content on the
iOS App Store even for tablets is
chock-full of quality applications as
generally the first stop for developers
and has resulted in hundreds of
thousands of tablet compatible
applications for download
while the iOS software itself may be
dating poorly the content within the App
Store is what's keeping the iPad brand
relevant and even ahead of the
competition on Android the story was
once quite different one had to search
high and low for decent tablet
applications but high quality tablet
apps have slowly found their way to
Android 2 though not nearly to the same
degree just yet there are tablet
applications to be had but there are
still a ton of apps out there Facebook
for example that do not support tablets
once you look past the application
support however the Galaxy Note 8.0
jumps ahead way ahead day I've had many
features virtually the same exact
software is the much smaller iPhone sure
the homepage has been updated to hold
more icons and folders and the settings
application is paying to be better
optimized for extra real estate other
than that there is nothing truly
compelling or unique about how the iPad
Mini operates there is no true
multitasking no additional features
aside from the display size that make it
any different from using an iPhone the
Galaxy Note 8.0 comes with the S Pen
which not only acts as a stylus but as a
tool that unlocks more unique software
features on the tablet hold the button
on the S Pen and DoubleTap the display
yes note will open and top the current
application hold the button on the S Pen
and long press on the display a
screenshot is taken or press the button
on the S Pen and outline a section of
the display where you want to capture
and it saves the selection as a clipping
for pasting into s note the Note 8.0
also comes with the multi window feature
which allows the user to run to
applications
side by side the application selection
may not be nearly as developed on
Android but on 8-inch tablets that's
less of an issue than it is with
full-sized tablets and we have such
expansive and useful software features
like multi window or pop-up note it's
hard to deny that the Note 8.0 has a leg
up on the iPad Mini in terms of software
content is something that comes with
time something that more of as being
added to Android by the week as far as
everyday tasks go
the Note 8.0 and iPad Mini Excel and
performance rarely skipping a beat or
bogging down both tablets feature enough
horsepower to push through common tasks
with ease but when something more
graphically intensive is thrown into the
mix the iPad minis dual-core a5 chipset
does tend to get bogged down while
playing the amazing spider-man on the
galaxy note 8.0 everything is buttery
smooth from swinging to intense fight
scenes on the iPad Mini the entire
gameplay is choppy such as the case for
a few other games too though more
lightweight games play just fine it's
difficult to compare performance between
two completely different operating
systems in the mobile space there aren't
too many software agnostic synthetic
benchmarks but if the SunSpider
JavaScript test is any indication to the
difference in horsepower between the two
mid-size tablets the Note 8.0 has very
little to worry about the Galaxy Note
8.0 ran circles around the iPad Mini
with an average of nine hundred and
sixty two point eight milliseconds - the
iPad minis higher 1440 nine point eight
millisecond average and the SunSpider
test lower is better battery life is an
important factor with any mobile device
without a long lasting battery you'll
stay tagged to an outlet which is hardly
mobile in normal use both the iPad Mini
in the Galaxy Note 8.0 last well over a
full day I struggled to kill either
tablet in a single day when performing
routine tasks browsing the web email
social media watching YouTube videos
like photo editing taking notes and some
instant messaging both lasted on average
about a day and a half
outside of normal usage either extremely
heavy usage or no usage at all
total standby the iPad Mini takes the
cake it easily lasts upwards of a week
on standby but the Galaxy Note 8.0
needed to be plugged in after just a
couple days of standby and an extremely
heavy usage the Galaxy Note 8.0 is 4600
million power battery seems to drain
notably quicker than the iPad minis
likely due to the extra horsepower under
the hood lastly the cameras on the two
devices will hardly knock your socks off
both are equipped with five megapixel
cameras and for the most part they can
pair with most smart phone cameras from
a few years ago
images like the level of detail we're
used to seeing in 8 megapixel cameras
and beyond colors are pretty washed out
and seriously
taking pictures where the tablet looks
plain silly but that's your own
prerogative on a serious note tablet
cameras are great for record-keeping and
both the Galaxy Note 8.0 s and iPad
minis shooters will suffice for video
calls and snapping stills and a pinch
both the Galaxy Note 8.0 and I've had
many our fine specimens in the mid-size
tablet market through most tasks they
perform quite well and they're both
ultra portable exactly what Samsung and
Apple intended when building these
tablets however it's hard to overlook
the most disappointing feature of all
mid-size tablets display quality when
5-inch smart phones feature 1080p
displays and 10-inch tablets feature
displays double that resolution it's
hard to understand why 7 inch and 8 inch
tablets still feature WXGA and 720p
resolution the density is so low
comparatively that it's difficult to
look at the iPad Mini or Note 8.0 and be
impressed with the display that aside
the Note 8.0 and iPad Mini are easily
the best midsize tablets money can
currently buy with the s-pen and
multitasking features the Note 8.0
offers the perfect amount of utility for
an 8-inch tablet and the seemingly
endless supply of content along with its
superior design and build keep the iPad
Mini though slightly underpowered in the
running for the best midsize tablet if
you can deal with some content gaps and
a lower quality build the Galaxy Note
8.0 is for you however if you're after a
premium tablet and don't need excessive
multitasking the iPad Mini is probably
your best choice
