pocketnow.com and even though recently
we had our software and user experience
tour of the Sony Xperia S it turns out
that Sony has just launched their
PlayStation Store and well so far sadly
it only works for the experience any of
you users of the Xperia Play will just
have to wait but let's talk about it
now when Sony said that they were going
to make their phones PlayStation
Certified I didn't think they'd take
that literal because they didn't say
PlayStation 2 certified or Playstation 3
certified or PSP they set PlayStation
and Playstations back from 1995-96 I
think some of you weren't even born back
then and the problem is that these games
are obviously there were good games for
most of us back then but they're not
really optimized for 720p resolution
display back then what we had were TVs
you know usual TVs the typical cathode
boxes not the ones that we see now with
720p or 1080p resolutions so obviously
games back then weren't optimized for
what we have now but still it's what we
got the way this works is fairly simple
and straightforward you go into your
application tray and then you have this
icon at the top that tells you let's
start the PS Store you go in there once
you launch it you get an information
about the phones that are being
supported currently trying to zoom in
here it only supports the Xperia Arc
Xperia Arc oh the Xperia Play on the
Xperia NX and Arco HD in Japan and then
in the United Kingdom France Italy
Germany Spain and Australia the Xperia S
now I got these this Xperia S in
Barcelona so that's why it's still
working even though I'm an on notice
right now I could probably be in the
United States so you have to download
these two applications one is 1.07
megabytes which is the playstation
pocket which is pretty much the launcher
and then you have the PlayStation Store
start with the store and then you start
with the pocket once these are
downloaded you don't want get into your
application train you get these two
applications installed the PS Store and
the PS pocket is mentioned within the PS
store you have to log on to your
information so signing in you have to
create a sony online store account for
this to work and obviously leave your
credit card once the store is launched
you'll notice that there are 16 titles
and that these 16 titles all cost six
dollars now the interesting part here is
if you go into any of these titles try
to move to the bottom you'll notice this
is 1995 let's go back to
Hot Shot golf see where that's from
mm these are not new games and the only
reason why I chose for example Warhawk
is because I remember this game was
published in 2007 for the PlayStation 3
as it mentions therefore the problem is
this is the original Sony PlayStation
version of Warhawk so my biggest
disappointment with this service is that
obviously once you buy and by the way it
only works in landscape let's start the
PS pocket
this is Warhawk that I just purchased
and let's play let's start a new game
and you'll notice that everything here
is from back in the old days hopefully
you guys remember that's right
the old PlayStation way to launch let's
get this plane
you get the typical controls and then
look at this this is a four by three
aspect ratio we try to put the volume
down a little bit this is a four by
three aspect ratio because obviously it
was optimized for the TVs but back in
1995 it's not optimized for a 720p
resolution display and therefore you'll
notice that the graphics in the game are
quite choppy so let's move away from
this demo was 1995 Sony Interactive even
though it says 2007 so let's launch a
mission
sadly up touch controls don't work so
only the buttons that are on the side
you'll notice that the graphics are
grainy choppy old and 4x3
so let's start this game find and
retrieve this canister ok let's start
playing
notice all the choppiness in the game
obviously this is a 1995 game and even
though it's got all the sorry about that
even though it's got all the nine yards
of a typical game from the old days well
it's not optimized for this display
obviously I tried to use it on the
Xperia Play because it's got lower
resolution than this but sadly it's
still not working and still not
available let me try to get a lock here
mark let's see so again if you were born
back in the 1980s and hat and old an
original PlayStation this is definitely
a treat for you at least for the 16
titles that are there but would I play 6
bucks for this
honestly I tell you know I definitely
not pay 6 bucks for this now I know this
is going to be a very rude comparison
for Sony but how about if we try a
typical game in the Android Market this
is dead space from EA and this cost me
50 cents a couple of days ago that was
on sale in the Play Google Play Store
and let's just see it let's just compare
I mean look at the pixel density look at
the quality look at the detail this is a
game from now that's obviously not
optimized for game console it's
optimized for computer and the and the
portable you know phone tablet but look
at the detail see if I could skip this
let's go to play
have a look at the detail in the
graphics probably this is not like the
best game in the world obviously there
are other options out there but if we
would compare this for 50 Cent's or I
could even pay the 10 bucks that it
costs whatever it's not on sale but
compare this to the Sony Playstation
games I mean if Sony would have said
PlayStation 3 or even PSP even though
PSP has a terrible resolution in
comparison to what this phone has I
would have probably said sure why not
but I would definitely not recommend
that you pay the $6 for any of the old
games unless you definitely come from
the old-school gamers that want to have
those old games from the past
currently the PlayStation Store is
pretty much just an emulator that plays
are arms from old school that you could
probably even get on the Android Market
on your own so is it worth paying not
really sure I'd recommend so that's it
for our hands-on tour of the Sony
PlayStation Store for Xperia devices
hope you enjoyed it don't forget to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
