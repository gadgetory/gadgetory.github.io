terms of the specs of the Galaxy S 10
trio next year Samsung just teased the
samsung galaxy a8 s and that truly bezel
s display with the new technology and we
get some predictions on what to expect
for Apple's upcoming iPad event I'm
highly metally that and you know what's
funny how Diego was able to pull out
some amazing funny edits for the recap
and then he completely is run out of
jokes for the daily this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
more deals for the samsung galaxy note 9
those of you in the market there's a
trusted seller on eBay that has the
Exynos variant which is the
international one we've got the typical
specification six years of RAM four
thousand milliamp power battery pretty
much everything under in twenty eight
gigs of storage so the only thing is you
get an Exynos variant which people
actually want in most cases for $270 off
you can learn more in the description
now let's talk about Apple min cheek
whoa and predictions for the iPad event
that's happening next Tuesday set your
calendars apparently we're getting a new
iPad Mini finally and supporting Apple
pencil we've got two new iPad pros and
we've got all the specifications that we
heard of including USB see and it seems
that we might be getting up to three
Mac's one of these to be really
affordable which in apple terms is a
thousand bucks I guess anyways we also
hear that air power is coming in
addition to a new pair of air pods
I don't care about air pods now but
maybe that'll make me care about them
then so I would not buy any of this if I
were you right now now let's talk about
the oneplus 60 as we've got some
speculation that the new device will
support Verizon vans and bear in mind
we're not talking about Verizon actually
partnering with oneplus and launching a
variant for Verizon we're talking that
now there will be full compatibility and
just bear in mind because they've got
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8045 that
compatibility has always been there
technically it was just not enabled in
the past I guess or I don't know exactly
what the terms of the previous chips for
oneplus were but yeah apparently it's
gonna fully work on the carrier even
though you might need to buy it on
oneplus we'll see now let's talk about
Samsung the company just had an event in
Korea where they
showing us their new a lineup and within
the event they teased another fun date
and launch which is the a 8s and that is
a horrible name the point here is that
it has no bezels whatsoever and that
whole camera technology that we saw in
patents where there's just a hole and no
notch or anything on the display is
going to be part of this device which is
going to launch before the galaxy s 10
it's so interesting to see Samsung
launching mid Rangers with all this cool
technology like four cameras three
cameras and then all this display
technology now so yeah it seems that the
company is preparing for what's next and
finally the hot news today is precisely
what's next the Samsung Galaxy has 10
we've heard rumors of CES launch we've
heard rumors of three devices now the
differences are now being at ease to a
certain degree or at least rumored we
hear that the smaller variant is only
gonna have limited amounts of RAM and
storage will bring just one camera but
will be a smaller device for those of
you looking for that for this we'll be
looking for the middle and the larger
one apparently you're getting a
full-blown either two or three camera
device at the back and that all display
technology we're not exactly sure if
that all display technology is gonna
make make it to all the phones but we do
hear that you will be getting tears of
four and six gigabytes of RAM which I'm
like more really for the middle and the
large one and it'll start at 128 gigs of
storage whereas the small one will start
at 64 whatever the case may be let us
know in the comments I mean what do you
think do you think this is smart
strategy because in my case I wish that
Samsung would be like here are three
sizes small middle and large with
everything you want on all three phones
and just differences in battery size
that would be me leave us a comment down
below we love to know your opinion
