of the rumors are true while we may 10
is claimed to be more powerful than
anything we'll see this year and it
seems that the essential phone is losing
a couple of essential employees before
its launch i'm hilah Iveta and if you
want to catch some behind-the-scenes
footage of everything that happens
before this video goes live check out
our Instagram stories this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for a
decent SmartWatch the LG watch style is
currently on eBay for an insane price
tag 140 dollars even though the other
problem is it's a limited quantities and
number two the watch style is probably
the watch that I would least recommend
from Android wear it's not the best
performer but anyways if you want to
give it a start learn more in the
description now let's talk about
Microsoft and Nokia we've got some great
news as Microsoft is transferring 500
design patents actually more than that
to HMV global to be able to use these
nokia because both these were Nokia
patents that Microsoft acquired when it
acquired Nokia let's go the company kept
the patents and now everything is being
moved back so yeah those of you that
wanted that amazing photo quality that
we had from Lumias in the past and Nokia
devices in general yes this is about
that time and I cannot wait now let's
talk about the essential phone we
essentially still don't have it and it's
losing a couple of essential employees
first of all the company's a head of
marketing left a couple of weeks ago and
today the head of user design has also
left the funny part is he left for
Google and apparently he's going to be
working in the Google home division oh
but it makes us wonder exactly what is
going to happen with the essential phone
when will it launch we don't have
anything solid yet now let's move the
spotlight over to huawei we have a lot
of admiration for devices like the mate
9 at the t10 and according to the
company CEO we should expect amazing
things for the mate 10 fast err charging
better battery life in addition to
faster performance and according to him
that device is going to be all display
in his words there is no phone that's
going to be as powerful as the mate
that is a lot of claim but after we
experienced with the Maine tonight would
and how long it took Qualcomm to catch
up to the care 1960 in addition to
everything this phone could do yeah I
kind of believe we're always going to
pull this off I can't wait to see this
phone and finally the very interesting
rumors they have to do with the iPhone
eight yet again we've got some leaked
images of the devices packaging that
particular piece of cardboard inside the
unlocked units of the iPhone where it
explains how to remove the SIM tray yet
this pretty much shows that the bezels
that we've seen on leaks are true it
shows that that interesting bezel at the
top is actually going to make the cut
it's not as the previous leaks where we
saw that this is going to be part of
like a status bar or anything no Apple
is pretty much claiming that it's
intentionally going to be designed this
way probably the most interesting part
are those bezels at the bottom if this
device is real it's going to be
completely different to anything out
there I don't think there is another
phone with less bezels than that iPhone
a whenever it launches it leads me to
the question today we have been carrying
rumors of the iPhone eight like crazy
for weeks does this make you want to
hold out for this phone or are you
looking out for anything else like the
Galaxy Note 8 for example in my case I'm
not going to lie I have become more of
an Android user this year but I can't
wait to see if this phone is real leave
