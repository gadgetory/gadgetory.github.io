pocketnow.com this is another episode of
the android application weekly in which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
game is called astral commander and
there are two versions available a free
version and a paid version which costs
around two dollars at unlock various
worlds so I can just click continue the
object of this game is to move your
robots into the area of the mines and
prevent the mines from exploding and you
also get more points so I want to move
my little robot right here and once he
gets saturated with the amount of energy
from the mind we can move him off the
screen and then we get more points
unfortunately if you crash the robots
into each other they will explode pulse
is a free application available in the
android market that brings many
different internet feeds news feeds
directly to your android device so i
have all these different channels that i
can choose and i even have the pocket
now channels at the bottom so let's say
they want to view this swype pad and we
can get a little blurb about the video
on youtube or we can go to the original
article just by clicking here we can
also go back let's say that i wanted to
share some of these all i do is click on
the plus sign at the bottom and go to
bump and now i have to do is and all i
have to do is bump the two devices
together words view is really fun and
addictive word playing game and which is
kind of like a scrabble clone the object
of the game is to play against your
friends or you can also play against
random opponents on the internet and
there are two versions available a free
version and a paid version which costs
about three dollars and 23 cents so
anyways object of the game is to move
your tiles just like you would in
scrabble and to accumulate the most
points so right here and playing it's a
random opponent and just waiting for
that person to move so you can place the
phone in your pocket and we'll send you
a notification when it is your move
again X construction is a free game
available in the android market the
object of the game is to build a bridge
across this ravine here to allow vehicle
to pass over it so all i have to do is
move my finger and you want to try to
build as many triangles as possible
because the more triangles the more
structural strength you're a bridge will
have it looks as though i didn't do that
great ok so now i just hit play and wait
for my vehicle to either go over
or fall into the ravine if you like
saving money then you probably have some
of those shopper frequent rewards cards
or whatever they're called this
application called key ring which is
free on the android market allows you to
save all of your key codes and barcodes
directly from those cards so let's say
that I have a card right here all I have
to do is scan this barcode with the
application and wait for it to load now
we can add a custom label or we can
choose one of these programs so if I
knew exactly what the store was I could
choose it from here it will save it
directly to the cards that I have so
