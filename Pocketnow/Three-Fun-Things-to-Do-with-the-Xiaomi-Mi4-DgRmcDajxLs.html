using the Xiaomi me for in in my time
with it I've discovered some pretty cool
features I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and here are three fun things
to do with a chamois me for the awesome
people over at 28 Mobile are the reason
we had a chance to look at the Xiaomi me
four so go check out their site to see
what devices they have for sale or to
pick up me for to call your very own
click the link in the description below
or simply go to 28 mobile comm we just
wrapped up a review of the Xiaomi me for
earlier this week it's a fantastic phone
which like many others is not without
faults however embedded deep in its
software are some fun little tricks that
are extremely helpful here are three of
those features just about every
smartphone now comes with a set of quick
toggles an easily accessible panel of
switches and buttons for the most
essential settings brightness Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS sounds etc me--why on the
v4 is no exception however it's more
customizable than any other pre-loaded
Quick Settings panel I know of simply
pull down the notification shade and
select the toggles tab if you hit more
you're met with a page where you can
rearrange the order of the toggles no
biggie a lot of quick settings pages
have this feature that said if you hit
the notifications button at the very
bottom of this page it will shoot you
into the notification settings in the
Settings app there you can determine how
your toggles are displayed either as a
whole page or a bar at the bottom of the
notification shade you can also toggle
things like a connection speed display
showing the service provider and how the
shade reacts after you select a setting
when you plug headphones into the
me--for for the first time you are
prompted to set up with the inline
buttons do which I couldn't get to work
with my Bose mi e2 eyes but you are also
prompted to set up which type of
headphones they are general earbuds in
ear headphones or one of shammies own
set of buds you'll need to enable the me
sound enhancer to choose the most
relevant option from there you can also
say equalizer settings choose between
sub presets and slide the frequency
adjusters until your heart is content
finally since the me--for has capacitive
navigation buttons including a Menu key
it's unlike most current Android
handsets but I think there's a reason
Xiaomi has stuck with capacitive instead
of on-screen buttons there's a settings
submenu simply called buttons there you
can choose what long pressing each of
the capacitive buttons will do you can
set no function or launch the recent
apps tray assistant or Google now and
close the current app by long pressing
one of the three navigation buttons from
the lock screen you can also select the
back button to launch the camera and
take a picture in one step you can also
have the volume buttons wake the screen
and you can control the backlighting on
the navigation buttons are there some
fun features of the me four that we
missed tell us about them in the
