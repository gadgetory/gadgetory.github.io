pocketnow.com as phone screen sizes get
larger and larger they become
increasingly cumbersome to use as actual
phones holding a 1x or a galaxy note up
against your head looks weird and it
feels weird so you can do a few things
you can use speakerphone but the problem
with speakerphone is that everyone has
to hear your conversation it's not
private you have to hold the
speakerphone at the right distance so
you can hear the other color they can
hear you and these tinny speakers that
come on smartphones just aren't good
enough to produce a lot of volume option
number two or perhaps three is to use a
bluetooth headset but Bluetooth headsets
have to be charged all the time or
they're no good you also have to spend a
little bit more money if you want to
bluetooth headset with really good sound
quality something that cuts down on
background noise what if there was
another option something that was
comfortable had a lot of volume was
inexpensive and something that was also
private well we might just have the
perfect solution it's called the pop
phone and we're going to talk about it
now
so this is a very simple product and I
saw it in staples on a display and I
thought you know that is really a great
idea it's about 25 bucks on amazon com
comes in a variety of colors it's really
a tremendously simple piece of
technology it's basically a phone
receiver that fits extremely comfortably
up against your ear you can even do the
little secretary like thing and the
other end of it just plugs right into
your smartphone it's a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack just plug it into your
phone and what's kind of cool is that
there's actually a button in the center
of the phone here that you can use to
answer calls and to hang up and it
sounds crisp and clear it's discreet
because other people aren't hearing you
you don't have to recharge it and it's
just really comfortable to use as an
actual phone and I'm making a call right
now because I press the button in the
center there so it will put links up to
Amazon to get this it's called the pop
phone it's a really cool product if
you're looking for a comfortable way or
more comfortable way to make a phone
call on your smartphone if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
