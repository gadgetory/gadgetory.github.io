pocketnow.com we're here at CES 2013 and
we've come across some truly interesting
design with Android hardware from a
company you've never heard of probably
called noite Avani
let's take a look what they have now the
reason we're showing you this is because
seldom do we see any difference in
design and Android hardware it's always
just about the same these are just later
this year as design language all around
the device nice chrome accent and just
wrap your fingers around it it feels
like a nice cohesive thing those of you
that like the Nexus 7 a smaller form
factor we've got a smaller tablet here
again carry over the same design
languages as these other products just
this really nice edge white design
really cool stuff it's cool to see
innovation in design so again the
company is called noite Avani and if
they start selling these anytime soon
I'm probably gonna buy some and you'll
see them through a few come on unpack it
out hey guys Michael with pocketnow.com
getting ready to leave the exhibition
hall for the day at CES 2013 in Las
Vegas here but we stopped to the company
and I'm trying to pronounce really
really really hard and noise of onion
clothes very good and I think they're
going to come to Marco to the brand name
know it we kind of don't know but
Brandon Redmond has shown us some of
their concept designs this is actually a
working device this has what is this
called this is what about Recon series
we haven't actually made the actual
device for the market as of yet okay
phone is on them I'm here with Hershel
from monoids
correct and this is a rugged device this
was actually was a person that called my
I have you've been a long time watcher
you know that I like phones that you can
beat up and take on adventures and this
boasts right on its casing here this is
ip68
fully immersive all in water for
probably what an hour half hour sweat at
an empiric and if military standard 810g
to plan which usually put seems like
glowing rain human right so clogged this
is an 8 megapixel camera hiding behind a
very beefy gasket there what is that a
100 decibel speakerphone every 20 to 25
feet drop I'm not gonna do it cuz you'll
break the glass hobby report oh nice
and we're still guessing I am very
excited we've still got Android
this is ICS here but it is still running
just fine with some interesting software
customizations I'm sure none of this is
quite final but this is just it's just
wonderful to get our hands on something
truly different as Brandon said in the
other video so we're gonna keep an eye
on annoyed in the days weeks and months
ahead and you should keep an eye on
pocket now for the same period as we
continue covering CES and really
interesting stuff and guys thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
