rather impractical for a SmartWatch but
it offered the capabilities of a
smartphone on your wrist well we got our
hands on the more circular
second-generation gear s device today
but before we set on our quest to see
what it can do we have to get a box out
of the way
I'm Jules Wong with pocket now join me
as it's time to unbox the Samsung gear
s2 on a day as cold and damp as this one
that's good to know that the gear s2 is
rated to ip68
water and dust protection but the box
isn't so let's get those stubborn
stickers off and uncover the cylindrical
goodness inside and centre of attention
is the watch of course we should note
that this is just the s2 not the s2
classic and it's the Bluetooth connected
model so no 3G here but just as
important as the watch is what's beneath
the false bottom which contains a page
from Motorola's playbook a charging
cradle the other typical power
accoutrement
are here along with a typical packet of
literature there's also a second band a
smaller band for smaller wrists it's
made of the same material as the one
already attached for our block model
it's a grey elastomer like element that
actually feels pretty comfy on the wrist
if you want to change out the band's be
careful you have to push out the watch
cases buttons and then lift the band at
a certain upward angle if you end up
fussing too much you might rip the band
apart which I won't demonstrate for
obvious reasons but I got close there
are two buttons on case right the bottom
one takes you home the top takes you
back face down you'll see the heart
pulse monitor and then back up again as
you power this two up sits the 1.2 inch
AMOLED screen and it's a pretty thing
indeed at this point you're prompted to
find your phone download the gear
manager app from samsung site and go
through setup now supposedly any brand
Android phone can work with the gear s2
and not just galaxies but I had to
trudge through to wellspect
lollipop phones that more than
adequately fill
the bill to find a third running on
KitKat that could actually download that
the setup process was straightforward
mind the fact that I'm still waiting to
verify my new my Samsung Account to
download new apps for our gear but on
the watch we're all set we get a little
tutorial about how to use the rotating
bezel you get a look at widgets if you
spin clockwise to the right
notifications to the left and swipe up
for it toggles but that ring sure feels
satisfying to spin we'll be taking a
spin with the Samsung gear s2 for a bit
so be sure to keep up with this and all
other coverage at pocketnow.com plus
everywhere on the internet you see us my
name is Jules Wong i'm on twitter at
green point zero and as always more
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
