pocketnow.com
and this is the hardware tour of the new
AT&amp;amp;T pantech matrix Pro this is
basically the successor to the original
pantech duo and we're gonna take a look
at that and compare it with the new
version soon now the reason that they
called it the matrix probe was because
the matrix is kind of a non smartphone
version of this so this is the
smartphone version of the matrix they
call it the pro so that's that's where
the name comes from so let's take a look
at the device it is very rounded edges a
total fingerprint magnet on the front in
fact I haven't even touched the screen
yet within the last few minutes because
if I did look what would happen it would
get lots of fingerprints on it in hand
it is very very very thick in fact it's
as thick as a stack of 13 quarters to
give you an idea of exactly how thick it
is it's thicker than the 18 t tilt which
is also the Titan to just trust me when
I say it is quite thick so let's take a
look at the rest of the device we have a
2.4 inch diagonal screen with QVGA
resolution so that's 240 across and 320
down we have the speaker here and going
down here we have a much larger d-pad
than we found on the original pantech
duo and you'll see that in a minute we
also have a soft key menu here and here
we have a home button here which is kind
of flat and it's really easy to miss
this button and accidentally hit the
button above it because they're kind of
on the same level there and then we have
a call start call end button and then
the back button here that you find on
all Windows Mobile non touchscreen
devices if we slide out the first slider
we get a really nice-looking keypad but
unfortunately it is totally flat meaning
if I rub my finger against this the only
thing I can feel is are these lines here
that differentiate the rows so I can't
dial without actually looking at the
keypad which is a shame
this whole keypad is backlit so when you
type on it and it's dark out or actually
doesn't have a light sensor so when you
type on it anytime the light will go on
something that's kind of weird and this
is a note on usability because the
device is so thick and there's such a
large distance from
this area to this area it's quite
awkward to use both both this area in
this area to control the phone because
you're going down such a far distance
it's kind of uncomfortable for the thumb
and I imagine that people with large
thumbs may find this to be a bigger
problem than people with average sized
hands so we have a microphone down here
and also notice that the buttons are
covered with a metallic finish which
will also pick up fingerprints on the
left side we have a volume up and down
rocker and then we have the record
button which will bring up the the quick
list that will allow you to switch
profiles let's take a look at the
keyboard actually and this is actually
one of the bright points of this device
is the keyboard the tactile feedback on
these buttons are fantastic I was able
to type quite fast
the worst part about this keyboard is
that the spacebar is in line with the
letters between you know the V key and
the B key so it takes a lot of getting
used to but once you do get used to it
it's a really good keyboard surprisingly
and the soft keys are here and here so
they're kind of within reach of your
thumbs when you're typing along so you
can operate the controls on the screen
something that I really like about this
device is that the screen is perfectly
centered on the keyboard so it looks
really nice when you're typing with it
it looks like the screen is where it
should be okay let's go to the bottom
here here we have the micro SD slot so
good thing it's external meaning that
you can take out your your micro SD card
while the phone is on or over on the
other side we have the camera button for
the 2 megapixel camera and then we have
a flat for the proprietary Jack and
pentek's jacks are really difficult to
use so here is the USB cable it's thick
and cumbersome and you have to line it
up just right and you got to jiggle it
and sometimes it just doesn't want to
get in there unlike micro USB which just
goes right in so perhaps I have this
upside down although the arrows on the
top see what I mean it's not it's not
very easy to use unfortunately and on
the top there is nothing on the back we
can see this kind of greenish blue color
to it which is kind of interesting it's
got a metallic finish to it so it shines
in the Sun a 2 megapixel camera with a
speaker here and taking on the off the
back we reveal the the battery which is
1,003
20 million powers we'll talk more about
battery life up in the review now the
matrix Pro sort of comes with a case it
comes with this which is made to look
like suede but it's actually just fabric
it fits well but it adds even more
thickness to a device that's already
extremely thick though if you're worried
about getting scratches on the the
matrix Pro it may be a good idea to use
this alright and so let's compare the
original pantech duo with its successor
or sort of it's the matrix Pro the first
thing that you'll probably have noticed
by now is that the the new version looks
much more high quality much more
aesthetically pleasing than the previous
version which had this kind of dimpled
pattern around the screen and you can
tell but after a little bit of use dust
generated under the screen another sign
of bad build quality which is one of our
biggest complaints with the old pantech
duo the d-pad is much much larger which
is great the buttons have flattened out
a little bit which makes it difficult to
feel for unlike here where they're kind
of raised a little bit let's take a look
at the keypads again we have the flat
keypad here and on the Pentek duo we
have a kind of raised looking keypad but
it looks cheaper and and not as good
quality as the new version so let's take
a look at the side keyboards similar key
keyboard layout although these buttons
are raised while these buttons are flat
and I think that's why the the new
matrix Pro has better typing response
than does the previous version in terms
of thickness they're pretty much the
same thickness I'd say that the matrix
Pro maybe a hair maybe a millimeter
thicker than the previous generation and
flipping over to the back we don't have
that battery bulge that we did on the
the old version on the new version which
is good lending to cleaner lines and the
old version had a 1.3 megapixel camera
the new version has a 2 megapixel camera
though oddly they left out the self
portrait mirror which is kind of
interesting a way that the old pantech
duo has a leg up on the matrix Pro is
that there's a quick way to access the
lock a keyboard lock unfortunately on
the new version you have to press the
quicklist
go down to lock so it's basically three
steps to lock the device whereas on the
previous version it was
just one so I think that from at least a
design perspective
pantech did some really good things with
the matrix Pro to improve upon the last
generation device which looked you know
not modern it looked cheap and it felt
cheap in hand we have a lot more to go
on the pantech matrix Pro we're going to
do the software tour next and then we're
gonna have the review posted soon on
Pocket nail comm which will talk about
battery life and performance and all
that good stuff
so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
