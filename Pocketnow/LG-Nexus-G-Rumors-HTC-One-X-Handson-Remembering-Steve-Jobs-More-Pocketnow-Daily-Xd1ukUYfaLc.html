hands on the HTC one x+ and one VX for
AT&amp;amp;T and the will remember steve jobs a
year later I'm hi Mary vetta seriously
worried about that LG Nexus thing and
this is parking out daily
yes believe it or not the next Google
Nexus device may be built by LG it's
already being dubbed the LG Nexus G
being based on the Optimus G and for the
good part it will have the same
quad-core Snapdragon s4 processor along
with the same two gigabytes of RAM and
it's even going to bring wireless
charging which is different to the
Optimus G but the good news in there
apparently it'll be stuck to 16
gigabytes of storage with no expandable
storage which is just terrible we're not
in the year two thousand eight anymore
we have no dates no specifics and yes
I'm gonna be lighting up a candle just
praying for this not to happen that's
right AT&amp;amp;T one sort of crazy this week
by launching a ton of products and they
even held an event yesterday in New York
City to show us all the goods both
Michael and Brandon were there we have a
full video of all our hands on coverage
of the HTC One x+ of the one VX of the
Samsung Galaxy camera and we even
revisit the Nokia Lumia 920 so make sure
you hit the link now if any of you rely
on iOS 6 matt sorum should i say you're
stuck on them you'll be happy to know
that there are some improvements already
being seen specially in the new york
city area you'll notice a 3d maps
rendering and fly over already looking
much better than they did before though
we sadly still can't confirm
turn-by-turn navigation has improved in
accuracy so if any of you are using them
and you're not lost already leave us a
comment and the microsoft surface phone
rumors keep coming strong as apparently
the guys at redmond are already looking
for a manufacturing partner to build the
phone rumors have it that media tech
will be one of the partners but things
got really funky when they started
mentioning Huawei and don't get me wrong
here I mean we always got some good
phones but the problem is none of them
are great phones they're cheap most of
the time though sadly we still don't
have any vegetables probably it still
seems it will happen in 2013 so keep
your Black Friday money for something
else and finally for the nostalgic news
of the day today marks a full year after
the passing of Steve Jobs and the whole
tech world is full of tributes one of
the best being Apple's own tribute to
see which you could catch at apple com
when you land on the page whether you
were fan of Steve or not we had pocket
knife at a lot of respect for his
contributions to all of the gadgets that
you guys are using right now to watch
this video are
sites pretty much wouldn't have a reason
for being if these gadgets wouldn't
exist we even built a tribute to steam
which we edited all the voices of the
pocket now editors going through huge
the crazy ones so make sure you catch
the links and that leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about apple products a year after
Steve's passing are you a fan of them or
not I like some I don't like some but
leave us a comment down below now if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet will make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hina be better thanks for watching
