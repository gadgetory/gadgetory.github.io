iPhone tense price will actually hinder
its sales in a ton of markets Apple
watch Series 3 doesn't seem to be that
created LTE phone calls according to its
own specs and lo and behold all the
deals that you get for new iPhones have
just arrived I'm Jaime Rivera and for
all the news of iPhones yesterday
believe it or not there are a ton of
things that Apple didn't really want you
to know and it silently happened so
let's go through that this is PocketNow
daily about the only things that are
positive today have to do with the deals
and official news as well Sprint is
offering for example three hundred fifty
dollars off any trade-in and by any
trade and actually you don't really need
an iPhone if you want an iPhone 10 or an
iPhone 8 or eight plus on the case of
t-mobile it seems that you do need an
iPhone from the 6th and forward but then
again the company is compensating by
giving you three months of free service
on the Apple watch Series three and then
in the case of Verizon we only notice
the three months of free Apple watch
series three service then it's ten bucks
after that and we still don't hear
anything about AT&amp;amp;T we'll keep you
posted and how about if we begin with
the things that Apple doesn't really
want you to know if you look closely
into the Apple watch series three
specifications those battery life stats
don't seem too nice particularly if you
go for the LTE variants apparently even
though you are getting the same 18 hours
of battery life
you're only certified for those 18 hours
if you continuously do certain things
which include only making one hour of
phone calls and as phone calls become
less and less important over time it
makes sense for people not to be so much
on their phones let alone be on their
watches for phone calls but one hour
meaning of your own one hour call you're
pretty much losing the rest of your
battery life I think that that's really
risky obviously we will let you know
more as soon as we get our review units
and guess what other thing Apple didn't
want you to hear Apple Care Plus just
became more expensive if you want to get
yourself in the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8
plus Apple Care Plus will now cost you
one hundred and fifty dollars and we're
still waiting on the nitty-gritty over
what it'll cost you to be able to
replace a screen and replace a device
now in the case of the iPhone 10 oh my
god believe it or not 200
bucks 200 bucks for Apple Care Plus and
again we also need to get more details
on how much it will cost you to replace
a display or whatever this is not
necessarily the best deal but then in
the case of if you go for example for
that iPhone every year deal that Apple
offers were a bundles Apple Care Plus
that probably makes a lot more sense but
wait there's more in the case of the
iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus which still
remain in the market believe it or not
the red iPhones are not available
anymore for those of you that were lucky
enough to get these phones that was it
you no longer can get these devices and
if you wanted to get yourself an iPad
pro I would highly suggest you think
twice as they got $50 more expensive in
the case of the 256 and 512 gigabyte
storage variants not that I feel that
you need that much storage but yeah $50
more for iPads in the case of iPad so
don't really sell that well over time
but anyways and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
analyst predictions over the iPhone 10
you know that iPhones haven't really
broken records ever since the iPhone 6
the devices have actually sold less and
less over time and for those of you that
thought that these devices were really
the ones that we're gonna bring Apple
back into its selling limelight
apparently they won't it seems that the
price tag alone of the iPhone 10 will
make this device crazy in the case of
certain markets like China and others I
mean I was even reading your comments
yesterday over how much the iPhone 10 is
going to cost in your specific countries
and yes it is just insane and it's just
crazy and apparently that alone is going
to be the factor that's going to kill
the iPhone 10 up to the point where yeah
I don't think there's ever been a case
where a smartphone cost a thousand
dollars that's not one of those luxury
devices that's not really even worth it
but at least we to the question today I
mean do you believe that the iPhone 10
is hot enough to cost a thousand dollars
or do you believe it's not in my case as
I said yesterday because certain
phablets are costing close to that it
makes sense for Apple to price it that
way but I'm not saying that it's a
reasonable price I'm saying that it's
just what the market is trending towards
and I feel that the market is crazy but
pay leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion
