charger for the nexus 4 one arrived on
my doorstep this afternoon so let's take
a look I was sitting here shooting a
video when the doorbell rang it was the
UPS guy who had a little present for us
today the Nexus 4 wireless charging orb
get our little unboxing tool here my big
knife that I had laying on the desk
inside the box we can't get in there
there we go little paper inside the box
we've got some papers and your typical
USB cable this actually looks like it's
might have been opened before the USB
cable is starting to come unwrapped
already but it is just a standard micro
USB cable that plugs into the back of
the unit I'm guessing with a u.s. power
adapter for AC and the orb itself which
is very oddly reminiscent of the Nexus Q
by Google which was a released last year
the round little spherical shape yes
it's got dust and dirt on it already
let's go for the nice peal sound yeah
that was good it was really good I liked
that a lot
but the box is kind of weird
it's a really weird design and it does
it looks like it's already been opened
and taped back or something I don't know
that's just really strange see it looks
ripped inside I don't know it's really
strange
leave low quality packaging but you
would expect it would be very high
quality for something so expensive this
thing retails for $59.99 and they're
currently in stock still if you want to
get one the book is also kind of messed
up the wireless charger stuff Quick
Start Guide is comes with krinkle pages
and stuff
and the other package the other paper is
your limited warranty so here is the
actual orb itself if we can get a
autofocus on this thing it is just a
that that's got a little sticky surface
on it I guess so it'll hold on to the
nexus 4 little friction there and the
back is there's just this one port for
your micro USB charger and also some
more friction as a rubber or place
holder on the bottom there but you can
just toss your nexus 4 on it and it
stays sort of there we go
so let's get this thing plugged up and
see how it works before I crawl under
the table and plug this thing into the
wall let's take a look at the cables the
both ends of the micro USB cable are
very high-quality it is a very premium
feel to it and it fits snugly in the AC
power adapter which is also very high
quality it's lightweight plastic but it
is built really well I finagled the
cable around out of the table and let's
check out how this thing works
drop the nexus 4 ohm it charges and you
don't have to worry about the device
sliding off the friction pad on the
front of the charging orb is extremely
tacky and it doesn't let the device
slide around take the device off it
stops charging drop it back down and it
starts charging again I took the time to
also grab my Nexus Q which is very
similar in design to the Nexus 4's
charging orb they're both spherical and
have a slightly slanted cut on the
bottom that make them sit at an angle
it's very unique looking and
distinguishing build quality is
fantastic the device is actually very
weighty and it feels great in the hand
which I don't know why you'd be holding
it but it does feel very high quality
like I said the friction pad is very
tacky and you don't have to worry about
sitting the device on the pad just right
you don't have to line anything up it
just works the real question is how fast
does this thing actually charged since
that's the only thing it really does
I've been charging for less than an hour
and the percentage has jumped from 58%
to 84% that's pretty fast the DC output
is 1 amp and the Google Play Store lists
the average charge time about 4 hours so
it's not super fast not slow another
important tidbit is that it works really
well with a bumper case or even if you
have a skin on the back that stuff
doesn't really bother it at all
it still sits perfectly on the orb the
question is is this thing really worth
the money it retails for $60 so it's not
exactly cheap but it is really cool and
it props up the device for me it will
probably remain a device in my personal
Arsenal for as long as I have the Nexus
4 this has been a quick look at the
Nexus 4 wireless charging orb I'm Taylor
Martin with PocketNow and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
