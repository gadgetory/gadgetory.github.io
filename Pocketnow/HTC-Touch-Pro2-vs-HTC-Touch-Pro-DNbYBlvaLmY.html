pocketnow.com and this is a comparison
between the HTC Touch pro2
and the HTC Touch pro we've been getting
a lot of requests to do this comparison
because people that have the touch pro
are wondering if they should upgrade to
the brand new Touch pro2 or if they
should wait or if they should pay the
money etc and so forth in this video
we're going to compare the hardware of
the two devices and in the next video
we're going to compare the software so
let's start off comparing the
specifications of the two devices both
devices clock in at five hundred and
twenty eight megahertz running Qualcomm
CPUs although interestingly the touch
pro2 has a slightly older version of
that processor the MSM 7200 a and the
touch pro has the MSM 2070 201a both
devices have 512 megabytes of RAM
storage ROM and 288 megabytes of RAM
though again oddly the touch pro2 has
about 20 megabytes less of available RAM
meaning your ability to multitask is
slightly decreased on the touch pro2
because you're missing that extra 20
megabytes of RAM both devices share
pretty much everything else they both
have Wi-Fi B and G they have a GPS they
have bluetooth although the touch Pro
has 2.0 and the touch pro2 as the new
2.1 both have extended data rate on the
Bluetooth the touch pro has an FM radio
whereas the touch pro2 oddly does not
although it's possible that it has the
capability just not through the software
the guys that XD developers are trying
to work something up to get that to work
so that's pretty much it on
specifications we're going to post the
link on pocket down now showing these
two devices side by side so you can get
a better feel from all of the
specifications that differ between them
so let's talk about the actual design of
the devices when i zoom in a little bit
the first thing that you notice is that
the screen on the touch pro2 is huge
it's 3.6 inches by comparison the huge
screened HTC Touch HD has a 3.8 inch
screen and really you really can't tell
the difference between the two by that
point two inch margin in fact a lot of
people are calling the touch pro2 the
Touch HD pro because if you take a touch
HD add a slide-out keyboard you pretty
much have the touch pro2 by comparison
the touch pro has ace much smaller 2.8
inch screen the bigger screen makes a
huge difference it looks beautiful it
looks fantastic and the resolution has
also been increased so on the touch pro2
the resolution is 800 down and 480
across whereas on the touch pro it's
only 640 down and 480 across so you're
really getting an additional bit of
widescreen there that helps a lot when
you're viewing webpages or when you're
using Google Maps mobile or reading an
email the extra resolution helps now
something that the touch pro2 doesn't
have many of his hardware buttons in the
touch pro we have a nice d-pad we can
click in the center we have four
hardware buttons but on the touch pro we
don't have a d-pad and a lot of people
are asking does that actually make a
difference and yeah it's a little bit of
annoying and annoying sometimes but the
interface is well enough optimized to
where you don't really miss having a
d-pad down there and especially with the
slide-out keyboard which has the d-pad
kind of buttons over here
it's not that big of a deal so we also
get the zoom slider on the touch pro2
which allows you to zoom in when you're
viewing a picture or in Google Maps or
in your internet browser but I don't use
it too much personally because I find it
to be very imprecise it's much more
precise to double tap on an area on the
screen that you want to zoom into rather
than kind of arbitrarily zoom into the
center or a random part of the screen
let's flip them over and take a look at
how they compare in terms of thickness
so the touch pro2 is actually two
millimeters thinner than the touch pro
which is great the touch pro was always
a hefty device that said it is taller
and it is wider let me see if I can line
these up it is wider so it does feel
like a big device but it feels good in
hand it feels very high quality it's
actually about 13 grams heavier than the
touch pro
which i think is actually pretty good
because if you get a device like the
touch pro2 such a high end device you
make it half the weight it suddenly is
gonna feel kind of cheap so the weight
is a good thing and it feels quite nice
so let's continue our tour around the
device here on this side we have the
auxiliary microphone that is used for
straight talk we'll talk about that in a
second and then we have the styli the
stylus on the touch pro will suck itself
in when you get close because it's
magnetic
but the styli there the stylus on the
touch pro2 does not it is not magnetic
you have to push it in all the way not
sure why they admitted this feature it
was really great to have the magnetic
stylus that said on both devices when
you take out the stylus the screen
automatically turns on so that feature
remains there and here we are on the
back and let's zoom in a little bit both
devices have a 3.2 megapixel camera
although the touch pro had a flash and
the touch pro2 does not the flasher
really helps a lot in low-light
situations and so if you take a picture
with the touch pro2 when it's dimly lit
outside just near sunset or you're
inside there's not that much light
pictures are going to come out noisy
that said both devices have selective
autofocus which is really helpful to
take a picture of a macro and that sort
of thing now what we see back here is a
little different is a button to mute the
speakerphone the touch pro2 has a really
fantastic speakerphone with straight
talk technology so if you're on a call
and you want to go to speakerphone you
simply take your device and put it flat
on it's on the screen this will
automatically turn on the speakerphone
which utilizes two microphones one here
and one down there to provide noise
cancellation I actually tested this by
having someone in a bathroom with the
water on and I was talking to them on
the handset and then I told them to turn
over the phone and when they did that
the water sound was very much quieted so
the noise cancellation does work and
they're also two speakers here to make
the speakerphone a little more loud so
that you can hear more than you would if
you were using the touch Pro
speakerphone so if we take off the back
battery covers we find that the battery
on the touch pro2 is a little bit big
than it is on the touch pro2 milliamp
hours here
13:40 milliamp hours here and are in our
tests the touch pro2 actually is worse
battery life than the touch pro it may
be because the screen takes a lot of
power to illuminate it maybe because the
keyboard which is completely backlit you
can't see it because it's off right now
takes a lot of energy to be backlit
could be for a variety of reasons maybe
it's the ROM maybe it's the older CPU
but the battery life on the touch pro2
is slightly worse than it is on the
touch pro and if you're considering the
touch pro2 you probably really care
about how the keyboard is and of course
the HTC touch pro has a slide-out
keyboard which has Magnus isten s-- with
a spring so you bring it kind of halfway
and it goes the rest of the way ditto
with the touch pro2 I think over time it
gets kind of weak so the touch pro2 is
very springy whereas the Sprint version
of the touch pro isn't as springy so
let's take a look at these keyboards
side-by-side the first thing that you're
going to notice and let's zoom in a
little bit is that the surface area is
much greater on the touch pro2 than it
is on the touch pro we get about let's
see how much distance this is we get
about 3/4 of an inch maybe an inch extra
of keyboard space which really allows
for wider keys and as you can see the
keyboard layout is offset on the touch
pro2 compared to the touch pro which is
which is unnaturally arranged in a grid
a keyboard shouldn't be arranged in a
grid if you look at it on a keyboard or
laptop or desktop they are offset like
this for a reason it's more ergonomic
and because of that the keyboard on the
touch pro2 is very very very good
especially for people with medium or
large size hands that have a problem
with really scrunched up keyboards maybe
they found that the touch pro2 had a
scrunched up keyboard but a very nice
keyboard indeed we don't have that many
shortcut buttons on here so we don't
have a button to the Start menu or an OK
button or even programmable keys but we
do get a dedicated number row at the top
which is very much welcomed we get a
link to messaging here a link to the web
browser
and of course you get all your symbols
up here I have to do is press function
to get to them on the touch pro we have
also a dedicated number row we have a
link to email to change your profile so
pretty much the same in terms of actual
buttons but the main difference is just
that the layout is completely different
and the keys are much larger on the
touch pro now of course another reason
you're probably considering the touch
pro2 is because of the tilting screen
came back the tilting screen goes up
about 50 degrees which is less than the
tighten to tighten to went up about 80
degrees and actually if you look closely
what's keeping it from tilting is a
little piece of a little piece of fabric
here it's probably really difficult to
see and behind the piece of fabric there
is a piece of wire so HDC probably put
that there so that people don't turn
over the screen all the way and rip out
the wires making this display go dead
but I feel like they could have gotten
another few degrees of tilt out of that
I know it's very tough to tell on the
video but anyway so you get fifty
degrees of tilting which is great the
touch pro of course didn't allow for
tilting so if you wanted to you know sit
at a desk and watch a movie or if you're
on a plane you'd have to position the
device up like this kind of awkwardly
not the case with the touch pro2 the
tilting screen is awesome and it's a ton
of utility and it's a great addition to
an already awesome device so the big
question if you have a touch pro should
you upgrade to the touch pro2 I'd say
yes and I would also encourage you to
wait till it comes out on your carrier
so that you can get it at a subsidized
price the fact that there are so many
hardware improvements to the touch pro2
the fact that you get a free windows
mobile 6.5 upgrade the fact that it just
works so well really makes it from a
hardware perspective a compelling
upgrade of course we're going to talk
about software coming up in the next
comparison video so watch out for that
and if you want more on the HTC Touch
pro2 be sure to check out our unboxing
software tour and hardware tour videos
and I'll put a link up on the video
right now so that you can click on to
those since we're at the end of this
video now so that's it for the
comparison between the HTC Touch pro2
from the touch
we'll be back soon with the software
comparison that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
