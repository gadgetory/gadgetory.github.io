optimus G which has LTE support so why
don't we I'm Joe Levi for pocket now and
we're Android power users here's how to
get LTE on your Nexus 4 first up some
disclaimers this information has been
around for a while a lot of you may be
saying this is old news there have been
some recent advancements and that's why
we're sharing it right now the initial
problem was the Nexus 4 doesn't have LTE
in it it's not entirely true see it did
when it originally came out you just
have to go in and turn it on and set up
your APN correctly well that would stick
around for a little while and then no
longer work and then Google pressed out
a patch that turned that off so we
couldn't do it anymore
after that certain hacks were released
that let us do that again but again it's
been somewhat difficult the biggest
hurdle so far and the reason that we've
put off showing this to you until today
is Android 4.3 see one of the problems
with this hack before we get into the
problems let's get into the guts of why
why this isn't in the phone to begin
with it's not in the phone simply
because it's not FCC approved to be in
the phone and Google wanted to cut some
corners and save some money with LTE
that makes sense right so there's not
all the stuff that you need to get LTE
in the phone at least not optimally some
people have said there's no LTE
amplifier there's no LTE antenna blah
blah blah the chip is there the firmware
for the radio exists the settings
obviously exist so what's the problem
well that FCC certification is really
needed to do that in a legitimate way of
course it's the same essential hardware
as the Optimus G which does have FCC
certification so I'm not too worried
about it
first set of problems the bands are
somewhat limited Rogers you should be ok
t-mobile
LTE yep you're good
AT&amp;amp;T some others it may be hit or miss
probably not keep that in mind you can
go ahead and try this it's not going to
hurt anything if you don't have LTE for
that particular carrier or that
particular band rather so you may as
well give it a shot last problem is
Android 4.3 support now the reason that
this is taken so long as up until just
well not long ago if you wanted to use
Android 4.3 and this hack you had to
give up voice audio on your phone calls
at least on t-mobile which I have and it
was painful and I wasn't really prepared
to show you this and say hey this is
great until the upgrade and then if you
do you're kind of out of luck now that's
changed there are some new hybrid radios
out there that combine 0.27 and point
three three or the point eight four and
blah blah blah yeah it works now so
there's no reason not to show this to
you right now and get you going there's
the long intro hope it was worth it to
you let's get down to flashing
first up you're going to need a rooted
phone this does require root I have
rooted this and I'm booted up into
recovery mode the next thing you're
going to need one of two different zip
files to flash that's a new firmware for
your radio like I said there are two
versions now the point to 7/8 for hybrid
and the point 3 3/8 for hybrid either
one of them worked for me the point 3 3
worked better for me but your mileage
may vary so try them both and see which
performance you get better enough with
that I've gone ahead and downloaded this
so let's go ahead and flash this we want
to install zip from sdcard do that we'll
choose the zip from sd I'm user 0 and it
should be in my downloads and right here
you can see these are the old versions
I'm running on 0.33 right now point two
seven I had in there as well
the one that we want now is the point
three three eight four hybrid so we're
going to go ahead and select that one do
we want to install it yes now I'm going
to have links to all of this the thread
is very helpful the download links I'm
going to have those in the article over
at pocketnow.com the links down in the
descriptions as you can see here it's
writing the modem image this takes just
a second to go through and do and it's
just that simple we're done all we got
to do now is reboot and make sure that
our settings are correct so that we're
utilizing that new radio next we need to
make sure that 4G or LTE is turned on
you can see mine already is but this is
how you need to go through and do that
sometimes this happens automatically
sometimes more than often it does not
especially the first time so we go into
settings and we're going to come down in
here to more under Wireless and networks
once we're in there go to mobile
networks and then we're going to want to
change our network mode so that
preferred is LTE GSM WCDMA hey if you
just do this one you're not going to get
HSPA or your 3G speeds if you do this
you're going to get that and then fall
back to edge so make sure you keep that
in mind select that and one more thing
and we're all set
next up also underneath the mobile
network settings is our access point
names tap that and here's where you'll
need to possibly add an addition to do
that just click on the plus sign and you
can add that in there here's what it
needs to be very simple all of this
other stuff you don't have to worry
about all you've got to do is make sure
your APN is set to fast dot t - mobile
comm once that's done you should be good
to go you'll want to go ahead and reboot
at this point just to make sure
everything's all set and then you should
see if you're in a 4G area like I am
your H should take and change over to 4G
that can take a little bit of time the
first time around next thing we need to
do
test our speeds so before running your
speed test net which is a great app I
love it make sure you turn off your
Wi-Fi if you're not you're going to be
testing your Wi-Fi speed not your LTE
speed so you can see here I've got full
bars I'm going to go ahead and begin
test you'll notice a few minutes passed
that's because I was getting some
updates to apps and I didn't want that
to happen
as you can see 12 megabit per second
coming down that's not too bad now in
this same location during off-peak times
like you know the middle of the night
I'll easily get 30 megabit per second
down and 9 to 10 megabit up so really
really impressive let's run that again
just in case you don't believe this
again no Wi-Fi there this is just for G
1415 megabit per second down switch over
to up and eight to nine megabit up and
this is now 8 a.m. so it's starting the
workday when everybody's starting to use
this so wow I'm impressed one other
thing I do want to say battery life on
LTE I always thought was going to be
hideous it's actually better than HSPA
in my experience so if you're not
getting these kinds of speeds try to get
at an off-peak time of day and if you're
still not getting them try flashing the
other run again this one is not the
other run the other radio this one is
0.3 3/8 for try the point to 7/8 for see
if it performs better for you if it does
go ahead and switch to it use that one
there's really no reason to use one over
the other whichever performance works
best now like I said the reason we
haven't showed you this before is there
was an audio problem so when you were
getting phone calls you wouldn't be able
to hear the other person or more likely
they wouldn't be able to hear you this
all-in-one fixed that but Android 4.3
broke that again until these hybrid roms
so now you can use it on both Android
4.2 and Android 4.3 without any problem
at all
so that's how to get LTE on your Nexus 4
I hope you found it helpful if you did
give the video a thumbs up to share that
helpfulness with other P
