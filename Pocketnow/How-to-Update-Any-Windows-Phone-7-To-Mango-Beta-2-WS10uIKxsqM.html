pocketnow.com and today we're going to
show you how to get windows for mangled
beta-2 on any Windows Phone regardless
if you are a registered developer or not
and we have already posted about this in
this how to update to Windows from seven
mango beta for all but at back at that
time it was beta 1 now Microsoft has
released beta to those who are on beta 1
will get automatically on beta 2 if they
are running the new zoom version which
is the beta but if you haven't taken the
plunge yet and you have a Windows Phone
7 we'll show you how to update your
Windows Phone 7 mango beta 2 so let's
get to it
alright so the procedure is rather easy
you will need one Windows Phone 7 which
doesn't have to be developer unlocked
you don't have to have a developer
account you will need the Windows Phone
support tools either 32 or 64-bit I will
post a link on this article how to get
them and you will need your zoom player
with which you can update your phone so
first of all prerequisite number one is
to have a Windows Phone which is running
NoDo
or the build right after node oh and
this film right here it's an lg optimus
7 running build 73 92 which is the
security update post node oh and we have
already installed the Windows Phone
support tools and we have downloaded the
small application which Mable's you to
download the beta 2 so let's get to it
if you have the aforementioned please
make sure your phone is connected to
your computer and your zoom player is
closed then we will go to the downloaded
batch application which is called update
that b8e
it's a batch file and run it in
administrator mode if you have Windows
Vista or Windows 7 and it will do its
thing read carefully the instructions
and press any key to continue and once
again and it will start downloading some
updates and it will automatically make a
backup of your phone right now it's
rebooting the lg optimus 7 and while it
will reboot and as long as it will take
we will just cut out of the video but
return just in time so there we are we
are rebooted we are in a special mode in
which Windows Phone connects to your PC
it's installing the drivers as you can
see it will install the LG 900 driver
which is ready to use
and it's right now creating a backup now
what's really important is that you
should save it in a safe place now this
backup will allow you to return from the
beta to nodo and get back to the
official track once Microsoft releases
the official mango update so people back
up off the backup of the backup for the
actual states which is the no state of
your phone we are halfway there and the
backup which this batch application
makes will be saved on your local drive
on its root in a folder called pre mango
state so make sure to say that I cannot
stress it once the backup is created as
you can see it will go to the next step
and will apply some updates and then
reboot the phone installing the update
now if you will not see anything in the
status here but you will see it on your
phone screen that there is a a status
indicator and it's currently working
whatever you do make sure you have
plenty of juice in your battery and do
not disconnect your phone until the
procedure is finished once the update is
completed it took approximately a 80.5
seconds it will automatically reboot the
phone there you go
and you need to press one more key to
continue now the backup will be copied
to that certain pre mango State the zoo
will fire up and you will see your phone
connected right here let's check on the
pre mango state to folder this is the
folder which keeps your node Oh
update please back it up in a safe place
now the batch has finished you can close
it but we will just minimize it and
we'll go to zoom phone let's see we
should be running the same build as
before 7392 that's true and right now
you will go into the settings and check
for updates an update is available for
your phone let me just try to zoom in on
that there you go and it's built 7403 it
asks you whether you want to update or
not and of course we want to do that so
we'll just click on update update now
it's currently downloading the update
it updated the Zeus after meanwhile
let's fire up zoom go back to phone
settings update and update update now ok
so it downloaded the update it
transferred it to the device is
currently rebooting it will end it will
boot into that special update mode and
which it will update the builds to 7403
we'll just wait for the update screen
and we'll cut it and get back when the
update is complete there we go and it's
installing the updates and it's almost
finished still updating at the end of
the update process it should restart
your phone ok this took some time
approximately 5 to 6 minutes but it
should be all ready soon and it finished
it will currently reboot the phone which
is step 8 out of 9 rebooting
just remember this is not the manual
beta-2 it's the mango build 7403 whoops
sorry for that
let's get back still rebooting windows
from animation
and we're back successful update you can
now disconnect your phone we will not
disconnect we will check the build
number just to make sure your the
settings about more info and let's have
it here focus 73-70 403 okay so this is
where the fun part starts as you can see
there is another update available which
is beta 77 12 meanwhile let's check what
version do we have on the zoom software
we have 4.7 1404 okay let's get back to
phone update this is what we are looking
for Windows Phone 7 mango beta 2 still
checking that's right
build 77 12 update and the same
procedure once again update now is
downloading the update there we go
download it now it's transferring the
updates to the phone and then it should
reboot again in that special update mode
to apply the update and right now it's
rebooting the phone and we are back with
the reboot we have the boot logo and
soon we will have the special update
mode right there and it will start
installing Windows Phone 7 mango beta to
build 77 12 we'll come back once the
update this close to finishing this
process can take a little bit longer but
it's working if your device seems to not
respond or it seems to not do anything
at all just do not disconnect it just
let it do its thing
because it's working as you can see it's
currently updating and will come back
just in a couple of minutes we are
around halfway there so you need to
on side just a little bit for a couple
of minutes and we'll check back in a
couple of minutes again we are getting
pretty pretty close to finishing the
stage it should be followed by a reboot
and upon which you will be able to see
Windows Phone 7 Mango beta 2 on your
Windows Phone 7 handset
let's just wait a couple of more minutes
to see that and we're back for the first
time first boot new Windows Phone logo
let's see just step nine out of nine
completing updates
it takes a little bit more than usual
and here we go phone is ready waiting
for the zoom software to be ready -
meanwhile we can check it says success
your phone has been updated let's see if
we can focus that's right let's check on
the build
there we go build 77 12 Windows Phone
7.5 let's just leave finish and you will
run into this read error the zoom
software can't access important data on
your device try disconnecting and
reconnecting them this is what we'll do
just to demonstrate something we just
plugged it back in and it requires you
to update to get the update click OK
can't find media for installation
package this is an error which is normal
because Windows Phone 7.5 mango beta to
build 77 12 well lets a tongue twister
because the latest beta 2 isn't
supported by zoo software which we had
previously installed we will have to
install a private beta of the zoo
software itself so for that we will have
to install our current zoom player right
here
we want to uninstall it asks to
disconnect the phone we just did that
and it's been hung installed and this is
where you install the Zune for public
trial beta we will install the 64-bit
version we accept install this should
take just under one minute it's quite
about finished installation is complete
we can now close it and let's plug in
the phone again it's installing a driver
ready to use it's connecting to the
phone
welcome to Zune we'll go to the setup
process and
here it is our phone running Windows
Phone 7 mango beta 2 with zoom software
version 4 point 8 point 2098 so this has
been a tutorial on how to get windows
from 7.5 mango beta to build 77 12 to
her Windows Phone 7 to any Windows Phone
7 for that matter this % ND night from
