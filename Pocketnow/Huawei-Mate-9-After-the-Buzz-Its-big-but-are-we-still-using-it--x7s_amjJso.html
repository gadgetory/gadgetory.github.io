tech reviewers go crazy unboxing and
reviewing it then after a week we all
move on to the hot new gadget how a
phone ages is as important as that
initial out-of-the-box experience so
let's do something about that last
year's p and mate 9 series phones proved
huawei was able to compete not just on
specs but on crafting a unique user
experience the mate specifically
showcasing a focus on Western audiences
with a proper launch in the United
States nine months later how has this
phablet held up does it still find any
use in my rotation against newer phones
as the company lived up to their
promises on new features it's time to
take a second look here's our huawei
mate 9 after the buzz right off the bat
if you follow our channel you know I'm
not the biggest fan of phablets but
alongside another big screen option from
last year this is one of the most used
phones in my collection I literally fire
up my mate 9 every day we use Marvel
future fight as one reference for
performance in our reviews but I really
am kind of addicted to this game only
with the arrival of the Qualcomm 835 has
any phone matched the horsepower of the
mate I'd like that to resonate for just
a second if you jumped on the mate 9
train you were 6 months ahead of the
qualcomm curve you'd be using a phone
which still posts competitive numbers
against the latest and greatest today I
can't say I've ever experienced this
reviewing gadgets before we have an
expectation that something better will
come along weeks after we buy a phone
yet here's an offering which will
probably make it to the end of 2017
still near the top of the pile using
this phone a lot for multimedia and
gaming a large battery and fast charging
has been a boon there are a lot of
grindy bits that you can run on
autopilot so coming back a half hour
later it's nice to know I've got a full
charge that hardware horsepower is
appreciated so we're happy to report
that the software has aged similarly
well while we made a lot of noise about
machine learning and optimization for
resource allocation the mate was going
to do a better job of dumping garbage
and keeping things tidy I can't really
comment on exactly what this technology
might actually be doing but on the
surface my mate is running
we smooth still especially for including
such an aggressive and pervasive skin
have been very pleased with this
performance emui is a perfect data point
to show the evolution of this brand
earlier examples were disappointingly
iPhone II but last year Huawei gave us
the option to toggle whether we wanted a
natural or not and the notification
shade is much closer to a stock Android
layout small but important changes to
tailor one device for Asian and Western
markets the mate also became a platform
for partnerships of course the Leica
branded cameras but sharing
user-generated content through GoPros
quick video editor in North America you
can also fire up Amazon's Alexa the mate
arriving is the first Android handset
with this kind of integration I can't
say I've used either very much I have a
video editor I like and Alexa
unfortunately can't function as
seamlessly as Google assistant can but I
am happy to see Kwame reaching out for
collaboration instead of reinventing the
wheel these are recognizable solutions
consumers might enjoy and get back to
those cameras the mate is still one of
my favorite photo platforms only bested
in low light by qua ways p10 plush like
his influence over image processing
might not be the best fit for all
consumers but there's a texture to these
shots their contrasting in a way I find
very attractive this is my favorite
example of how to do dual cameras on a
smartphone now video requires a bit more
discussion however I'm shooting almost
exclusively in 4k these days I like that
clarity and on Huawei that means using
h.265 the upside file sizes are smaller
the downside Google is being stubborn
not supporting this codec installing to
deliver their own video codec solution
you can't upload directly to YouTube and
Google photos does not alert users that
videos will not be backed up that's a
huge issue when your cloud backup is
broken at least on onedrive my files are
uploaded even if I can't stream a TVC
online this is certainly a Google
problem but it doesn't change the fact
that users are affected in a way where
they'll likely blame the phone even more
frustrating that Twitter and Instagram
will transcode HEV C to share compressed
video so the problem feels inconsistent
in how and where users can share clips
until Google stops
holding back progress our solutions are
an elegant it's unfortunately up to the
user to convert the file but happily
that can happen on the phone if you make
a highlight video and quick that will be
saved as h.264 but my preferred solution
is paying for the unlocked version of
CyberLink PowerDirector which will
convert and render a 4k replacement that
video saved in an output folder which
will then be automatically backed up by
google photos others have written this
off as too complicated or anti-consumer
but i'm not letting this go
I want 4k I want smaller file sizes and
I'm tired of waiting for Google again
this solution is inelegant but there are
solutions for working with hi2 65 and
we've been producing whole video reviews
on the road mixing phone and camera
footage recording the vo from phone
microphones and rendering videos from
mobile apps it's not hard at all when
you know how to do it shifting gears the
mate doesn't have any rating for water
or drop resistance but it's been a
fairly durable device considering the
screen size while shooting this after
the buzz video a corner drop from about
waist-high shattered the included
snap-on cover with no markings on the
phone I got really lucky there I did
accidentally peel off the screen
protector though and I'm terrible at
reapplying these plastic guards it looks
rough at the moment but I want to keep
this glass pristine I do have a small
concern about software support early
updates were timely especially when
delivering Alexa but we're now a couple
months behind on security patches
hopefully we catch up this hardware is
just too good to be left behind and we
are happy to see a few rumors filtering
out that Huawei is already working on
Android oh the stereo speakers are a
nice touch but the headphone performance
is only adequate and I hope Huawei will
clean up bluetooth in the future to do a
better job of toggling between audio
sources like transferring between
headphones and car speaker phones the
1080p display is fine for daily use if a
bit unremarkable but on this surface
area the mate is a poor option for folks
flirting with VR unlike the mate 9 pro
this phone never got true daydream
compatibility maybe the biggest drawback
is this somewhat plain design Oh panels
prevent the need for
ten abeyance I genuinely prefer
rear-mounted fingerprint sensors and the
camera housing looks good but otherwise
it's just a large plain gray slate for a
mate ten this year a little pizzazz or
some Sparkle certainly wouldn't hurt but
I've rambled on enough we should wrap
this up nine months later where's that
leave us with the huawei mate nine I
don't know that I've ever revisited a
phone which is aged this well the may
easily outperformed last year's handsets
and is still nipping at the heels of
current cutting-edge tech in the States
we got an incredible bargain with this
unlocked price for one of the only truly
big screen options of 2016 we're all
very curious to see what Huawei will
deliver as a follow-up but more than any
other phone I've covered for an after
the buzz I have the fewest reservations
here and recommending someone purchase a
mate nine today the cons certainly need
to be spelled out especially for people
who shoot a lot of video or need to
power nicer headphones but the pricing
is still in line with current premium
handsets and the phone delivers a unique
experience
it doesn't look or feel like it was
listed from a competitor and I still
really enjoy using it now if you'll
excuse me I need to get a new case for
this beast and maybe something with a
kickstand as always thanks so much for
