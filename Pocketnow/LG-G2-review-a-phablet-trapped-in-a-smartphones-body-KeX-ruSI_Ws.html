something of an also-ran in the US
market LG is set on making a big dent in
the Android world with its follow-up to
last year's Optimus G the lg g2
with a new design and one of the
beefiest spec sheets around the new
flagship seems poised to finally earn LG
some long-overdue recognition but in
terms of features how much is too much
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our video
review of the LG g2 if this phone spec
sheet were the cast list of a Hollywood
film the g2 would be one of the biggest
blockbusters of the year it's one of the
first smartphones to be powered by the
new Snapdragon 800 SOC whose four cores
run at 2.2 6 gigahertz that are backed
up by 2 gigs of RAM the phone's storage
is not expandable the but with 16 or 32
gig options most people will be covered
and though the battery is embedded it
tips the scales at 3000 milliamp hours
or 11.4 watt hours for maximum endurance
the camera is a 13 megapixel unit with
optical image stabilization and the
display is a 5.2 inch 1080p IPS panel
with the density of 423 pixels per inch
on top of those sits a bunch of bonus
features like an IR transmitter Mirasol
compatibility an FM radio and many more
this phone is not playing around so how
does all that power feel sitting in the
palm of your hand well if you're still
with us after that spec dump we'll tell
you in a word disappointing it's not
that the g2 feels cheap per se but it
does represent a step backward for LG
last year's Optimus G might have been a
little on the low-profile side
aesthetically but at least it's all
glass construction gave it a premium
feel the g2 with its glossy plastic and
lightweight build feels a lot more like
a Samsung device now look if you like
the feel of the galaxy s4 as millions of
people do you won't have a problem with
the g2 we were just hoping for something
a little more
Premium from a late 2013 flagship on the
plus side LG is gamble to place the
volume and power standby keys on the
back of the device has worked out well
the new placement is pretty finger
friendly in most situations and it's
allowed the company to slim the screen
bezels down to a tenth of an inch per
side as a result the display dominates
the front of the phone and it's truly
stunning the software running on that
display is sometimes equally stunning
but not always for the right reasons
LG informs us that the custom build of
Android 4.2.2 is not final software but
it's close enough to the release
software that we're pretty confident
this is almost identical to what people
are seeing on store shelves on the plus
side the software is eminently tweakable
and usually quite responsive we said in
our g2 vs. HTC one comparison video that
the g2 doesn't know what lag is but
unfortunately that's since proved untrue
like most Android phones the g2 does
stutter a bit as its home screens get
more loaded down with apps and widgets
but it's still impressively smooth most
of the time given how many animations LG
has shoehorn into the experience and you
can adjust almost everything from unlock
and scrolling animations to the home key
button Rose appearance you can even put
a shortcut button down at the bottom to
deploy the notification shade with a tap
that shade is a great example of an area
we think LG misses the mark in software
put simply it's a mess the toggles up
top are scrollable and very convenient
but the qslide shortcuts below waste a
lot of space and they lead to small
windowed versions of a limited selection
of apps this is supposed to help with
multitasking but the execution is not
good enough to make it truly useful
outside maybe hovering a calculator over
your email window to add up expenses or
something
a qslide is a symptom of a larger
problem the g2 features three different
ways to multitask and only one of them
is routinely useful that's not qslide
and it's not LG's new slide aside
feature either which is cumbersome and
doesn't play nicely with many apps due
to its side sliding activate
gesture instead it's the stock app
ribbon that remains useful which you can
find on any Android phone
LG would have been better served leaving
well enough alone here or implementing a
different multi screen approach as is it
seems like a half realized effort to
make the g2 into more than a smartphone
given its large screen size that makes
sense but it doesn't really work in a
word
LG's software experience is best
described as overwrought the company has
obviously done a lot of work to make the
Android experience its own and look some
of it really is beautiful but a lot of
it is just tacky and there's very little
attention to detail there are more
korean to english translation problems
and layout errors than there should be
in software for a flagship device
fortunately the sun comes out again when
we take a look at the g2 s camera the 13
megapixel resolution is nice even if the
phone defaults to 10 megapixel shots for
wide angle cropping but the real halo
feature is the optical image
stabilization which LG has managed to
include without resorting to a large
unsightly bulge in the casing what's
more the slimming down hasn't affected
the OIS system's performance video shot
with the g2 is very stable and the
camera also does quite a nice job with
saturation and exposure adjustments
though it's a little slow in terms of
autofocus for stills the g-tube packs a
lot of viewfinder modes from the truly
useful like manual focus adjustment to
the just for fun like the dual shot yeah
I mean dual camera feature yes it's
almost a direct port of Samsung's camera
software and let's face it so is a lot
of the g2 software load but in the case
of the camera it's a good copy that
works well that's borne out by the
stills the g2 captures it may not quite
live up to the low-light performance of
Nokia's Lumia line but it Trump's pretty
much all of its Android competition in
this space once you get into the light
of day that's where the g2 s camera
really shines sharp edges fine detail
and rich use some might say - rich
saturation
for photos that really pop LG has
definitely made a camera to be proud of
here
if photography factors heavily in your
smartphone purchasing decisions the g2
is definitely a contender in other
domains we go back and forth call
quality on the g2 is just about average
with callers telling us we sounded fine
and our own experience on our end
mirroring that except on speakerphone
which was weak audio performance for
media playback was also average with
LG's acoustic enhancements sounding
great through earbuds but again only
average through the bottom mounted
speakers which are low amplitude and a
little on the tinny side while that low
volume takes away from the gaming
experience a bit gameplay itself was no
problem
during our one-week review period with
titles like sparkle 2 and f-18 carrier
landing performing flawlessly and we
didn't have to worry about battery life
much while playing either the g2 lasted
over 26 hours of mixed use on our first
time off the charger and it's
performance has held up nicely since it
would still be nice to have a removable
battery and a part of that power savings
is no doubt a result of no LTE on our
global unit here but even so most
moderate users should still feel ok
taking the g2 on an overnight trip even
if they forget their charger the g2 is a
confusing device on the one hand it's
got specs that beat most other phones
out there with a gorgeous display and
one of the best cameras we've seen on an
Android phone
on the other it's got a casing that
doesn't really stand out from the crowd
along with software that while very
customizable is also tacky and over
engineered with some pretty undercooked
areas hiding in the shadows still the g2
is a better equipped contender than we
typically see from LG and despite its
similarity to Samsung's Galaxy family it
does offer enough standouts to serve as
a refreshing alternative to that Android
juggernaut we give the LG g2 a 7 point 7
out of 10
so those are our thoughts on the lg g2
folks but before you go anywhere let us
know what you think drop us a line in

consider buying a g2 over something like
a galaxy s4 and HTC One and then check
out our comparison videos detailing
those devices the full text of the g2
