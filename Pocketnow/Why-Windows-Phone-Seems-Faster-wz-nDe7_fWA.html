calm and we're wondering why does
Windows Phone seem faster than some of
the high-end android phones out there
let's check it out turns out Windows
Phone employs a few little tricks that
make it seem faster to the user even if
the actual task may take longer to
complete first up let's look at the lock
screen as soon as you start sliding
upwards lock screen images instantly
responsive and as soon as you're done
it's instantly finished compare this
with the galaxy s3's on locking
mechanism I swipe your finger across the
water but my home screen doesn't appear
until a split second after i finished
the water ripple gesture what about when
it comes to launching certain built-in
functions of both phones when i touch
the people tile on Windows Phone the
tile instantly responds to my touch you
can see it tilt in space as if it is
literally being touched and when I let
my finger up the other tiles instantly
fly away while the people have listing
loads this instant response is what
gives Windows found the feeling of speed
look at the same function on the galaxy
s3 if you look closely there's not
instant response to my finger touching
the icon this response clearly happens
after my touch is finished it does lo
the intended action faster than the
people have blows on Windows Phone but
the perception is that there is lag in
some cases there really is some lag
though for example if I'm already in
some other app and I want to go to the
home screen I'll press the home button
again if you look closely the software
doesn't respond to the button press
until later windows phone on the other
end it starts responding instantly yet
takes a bit of time to finish its
animated transition though you'll see
that Windows Phone has the same kind of
lag problem when loading beam from the
search button of course this galaxy s3
is still running the old Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system and things
could certainly be different with
jellybean just as things could certainly
be different with Windows Phone 8
running on modern dual-core hardware
still it's interesting to see how some
subtle design change
is connect such an effect on perceived
speed thanks for watching and don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
