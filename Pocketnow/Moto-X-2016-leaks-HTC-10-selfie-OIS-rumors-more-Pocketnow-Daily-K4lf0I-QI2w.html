improvements for the HCC selfie shooter
we get the first leaks of the next Moto
X and good news might be coming and it
seems that Samsung is looking into
positive earnings with the galaxy s7 I'm
hi meri behna and I know I look tired it
is a crazy day to day so far but let's
get through the news this is pocket out
daily
the official news today start with the
FBI the iphone 5c in the whole San
Bernardino case for those of you that
are worried about the fact that that
phone got hacked and that they were able
to get into the information of the phone
well it really only matters if you use
an iphone 5c or any device with the a6
chip or below as the FBI director has
just confirmed that this pretty much
only works with those devices you
shouldn't worry if you have a new or
iPhone though it's kind of tricky that
they figured it out and speaking of iOS
this is rather interesting as we know
that one of Google's major nightmares
with Android so far is still writing
code on Java for the whole operating
system there are some major rumors that
apparently google is even considering
moving over to Swift which is the coding
language being currently used for iOS if
that move ever happens that would be
rather controversial or probably unique
or practical on behalf of Google that
again apparently it would bring some
major improvements in the speed of
Android that we wonder what would happen
to compatibility of applications that
everything will keep you posted as we
learn more and this is rather
interesting for those of you wondering
exactly how well is Sampson doing with
the sales of the galaxy s7 the company
has just provided official information
today it seems that it's up four percent
in sales revenue is pretty much rocking
42 billion dollars which is a crazy
amount and it pretty much tells us that
Sansa is going well with the galaxy s7
obviously the company doesn't really
provide any figures specifically to this
galaxy s7 or which unit is selling more
but it's great news to see the company
regaining its economical limelight now
as will the spotlight over HTC as we've
got some very interesting rumors from
the HTC 10 apparently optical image
stabilization might make the cut with
the selfie camera not the primary or
probably the primary but yet the selfie
camera the problem is that the leaks on
Twitter are no longer available but it
seems that this is probably going to be
a feature it's rather unique I haven't
really seen a smart phone ringing oh is
the selfie shooter and then again we
wonder exactly just how much
we really want to make selfies that
important we'll see and finally the very
interesting news today or should I say
leaks have to do with the next
generation Moto X for the longest time
Motorola now owned by lenovo has
struggled to have this flagship become
important and predominant in the market
even though you get a ton of things with
the Moto X you can't get with any other
smartphone one of the reasons why the
phone wasn't really so popular was
because of the lack of features like for
example essentials like a fingerprint
scanner and certainly leaks today have
showed us that a penalty the next
generation phone is bringing it though
this is rather interesting instead of
being at the dimple at the back it's
actually apparently in the front we
wonder exactly why but it does lead me
to the question of the day if you have
to choose where you want your
fingerprint scanner will you prefer to
the back or the front in my case to be
honest with you I prefer to the back i
just find it to be more usable they're
easier to reach but hey leave us a
comment down below what's your opinion
