same old song and dance we all go crazy
over the newest tech but after that
initial review period we all move on to
the next new hotness thing is how a
gadget ages is just as important as that
fresh out of the box perspective it's
how we hold companies accountable we
shouldn't shy away from that
conversation so let's do something about
that infinity displays cutting edge
cameras multiple methods of biometric
security
we're in full-on rumor mode for
Samsung's next flagship which is the
perfect time to revisit a phone you can
still buy today closing in on a full
year how is this puppy aged what worked
what has it here's our Galaxy S 8 plus
after the buzz
how can a manufacturer both lead the way
and play it safe at the same time look
no further than the Galaxy s8 Plus this
is the most successful version of
refining a phone line from 2017 both
breaking new ground for smartphone
design while wonderfully recovering from
one of the biggest tech disasters a
smartphone manufacturer has ever had to
bear it's incredible how much pressure
was heaped on this gadget and it's a
testament to how good of a phone this is
that it survived such intense scrutiny
it's a tightrope walk on paper only a
few bullet points truly separate this
phone from its predecessors but one big
item helps this phone feel like a
significantly bigger upgrade than we
found in galaxy's past we're of course
talking about the screen an early
example of skinnier taller displays LG
beat them to the punch but Samsung
delivered on a sleeker more eye-catching
design which is set the new standard for
all phones which followed it's still
fresh enough to impress especially
showing it to folks nearing the end of
their current two-year old phone lease
what's interesting to me while I'm still
an advocate of moving up to higher
resolution displays the si+ kicked off a
trend of moving back to 1080p I've spent
most of my time with this phone in full
HD and hasn't felt like much of a
compromise so much so that native 1080p
panels feel just fine for the most part
outside of magnified use like virtual
reality samsung also nailed the new
trend in security without ostracizing
traditional biometric unlocking under
screen fingerprint sensors weren't ready
for primetime so while the location is
less than ideal we still have that as an
option alongside pin/password and iris
scanning all screen on the front yet we
didn't have to reinvent the wheel for
basic control like maintaining a home
pulse where a button should be there's a
lot of functionality here which doesn't
interrupt the form of the gadget which
we can't say the same for some
competitors there have of course been
some changes just for the sake of change
sure over the course of a year we've
gotten used to Samsung's new layout in
UI long pressing for shortcuts swiping
in different directions for apps it's
not that we aren't capable
of adapting it's more why should we have
to these navigational differences
brought no benefit to the table and I'm
still cranky about the zoom rocker on
the camera app it's caused me to miss
numerous shots and it's up to me to work
around it again I can and I did
but why should I have to revisiting
Bixby I'm very happy to see how much
more functional this assistant has
become though I'm still not sure exactly
how I'd incorporate these features into
my daily use voice assistance in general
still have a ways to go for improving
casual interactions and commands there
are some terrific ideas on display
especially for easily creating macros
but more often than not it still takes
more work or more attention to get a
good result out of Bixby then manually
performing the same tasks and some of
this philosophy extends to the overall
hardware this phone has spent precious
little time out of a case regardless of
the video we show you I never use it
like this and if I had purchased this
phone with my own cash it would have
been in a skin on day one in addition to
wearing a bumper premium phones have
gotten too expensive and too fragile
huge surfaces of glass curved corners
just begging for a good side drop to
crack your day even shooting this video
makes me a bit uncomfortable showing it
off naked looks cool but feels a bit
dishonest from an editorial standpoint
in general use with the rear covered the
hardware has held up well but I haven't
been able to keep a screen protector on
it so it's covered in fine scratches so
I'm happy to report that the battery
hasn't suffered any significant
degradation it's still an all-day device
with the little extra juice after dinner
we're all a little sensitive about
battery performance not just from
Samsung's woes but also apples issues if
you're buying an expensive phone it
should have more than the bare minimum
capacity to make it through the day
brand new the s8 plus feels like it has
enough of a battery buffer to handle
another year of abuse performance wise
this has been one of the most well
behaved Samsung's I've ever reviewed
every galaxy I've owned has gotten a bit
stuttery after a stretch and this phone
is no exception
but the chipset manages to help minimise
those twitches there's still significant
custom software running on top of
Android so with the full suite of apps
driving this phone hard
feels a bit slower than competitors that
run leaner skins thankfully the worst
place this manifests are in games which
are poorly coded for Android anyway when
they chug
they chug bad but this isn't reflective
of general UI performance or covering
the basics it is software where I've had
the most concerns though we know an Oreo
update is around the corner if for no
other reason then the Galaxy S nine is
also right around the corner but it is a
bummer to see that our review unit is
still a couple months out of date on
security patches not only plugging some
recent holes in security this Hardware
would have benefited from Android 7.1
one of the most expensive phones on the
market what should we expect in terms of
support for a device were increasingly
living our lives out of the most
difficult thing about revisiting a
Samsung phone is that it never feels
like we ever quite leave Samsung phones
it wasn't that long ago we were
reviewing the note and - a zoom sensor
on the camera which I almost never use
and the s-pen which I actually do enjoy
the - are almost interchangeable it does
some weird things to your brain like
ubiquitous advertising it's like I can't
ever truly escape
the galaxy it makes the analysis part of
this video a bit easier though one year
later yes a plus is still a baller phone
we know moving forward we'll see some
refinement to the rear case probably
double up the camera sensors and AI tech
will be offloaded to a dedicated core on
Qualcomm future chipset similar to the
mate 10 pros keren 970 NP you some cool
bleeding edge tech coming soon but if
none of that is mission-critical for you
then the si+ will continue to be a
brutal competitor for phones launched in
early 2018 especially when you can get
one on sale as always thanks so much for
