Galaxy s4 plus Verizon's voice and LTE
networks I'm Joe Levi for Pocket now
this is the galaxy s4 Verizon edition
review we've already given quite a bit
of attention to the Samsung Galaxy s4
there's no doubt that it's a formidable
player and deserving of its flagship
status other than the radios and the
branding on the outside of the case the
Verizon version of the galaxy s4 has
identical hardware with its US siblings
the question of whether or not the
galaxy s4 is a great phone or worth
upgrading from one of last year's
flagship smartphones has already been
asked and answered now the question
becomes does the Verizon edition of the
galaxy s4 perform on par with its
siblings on the other carriers the first
thing you'll notice about the phone
regardless of which version is its
5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display we've
already bored you with pixel densities
and pentile displays to sum it all up at
441 PPI the screen is gorgeous to be
honest I didn't think I'd see much of a
difference past the 720p screen of my
Nexus 4 I was wrong
watching HD movies and reading ebooks on
the Galaxy s4 was beautiful the Verizon
version of the phone has the same
quad-core Snapdragon 600 CPU clocked at
1.9 gigahertz and the same Adreno 320
GPU packed with two gig of ram that the
other US variants have it's available in
16 and 32 gig varieties and comes with
an empty micro SD card slot which
accepts cards up to 64 gigabytes in size
the 13 megapixel camera performs the
same as the other versions of the phone
good but not great but enough of what's
the same let's get into what's different
the obvious difference is the inclusion
of the Verizon voice and data networks
which both performed quite well
Verizon's network seems to reach further
unless densely populated areas than a
dozen cities PocketNow is you two
offices are an ideal place to test this
in urban areas voice in LTE data were
flawless
audio was great
LTE was snappy in rural areas voice was
always good but data often dropped down
to what is best described as snail-paced
on to software blocking mode a really
nice Do Not Disturb feature included in
other versions of the galaxy s4 is
conspicuously missing on the Verizon
edition of the phone infinite scroll the
Samsung feature that lets you continue
swiping once you get to the end of your
home screens or app drawer has also been
removed another Samsung feature changing
your home screen mode between standard
mode and easy mode it's still there but
for some reason they call that starter
mode on the Verizon edition speaking of
software Verizon has always been the
king of bloatware in the past and no
that's not a very flattering title the
Verizon version of the galaxy s4 keeps
up the tradition the entire suite of
Amazon apps five or so and all come
pre-installed and although you can
disable them you can't remove them they
sort of made up for the extra Amazon
apps by removing some of the samsung
apps namely samsung optical reader the
Samsung App Store and chaton which may
or may not be a good thing depending on
if you use those apps all of the Samsung
gestures like air view smart scroll
smart stay they're all still there along
with sbeam though that's turned off by
default which we think is a good thing
for cross compatibility with other NFC
enabled Androids battery life even on
LTE was surprisingly good with the phone
lasting all day all night and into the
next day like the AT&amp;amp;T version the 16
gig Verizon edition runs about $200 with
a new contract and the 32 gig variant
goes for $100 more both are available
now the galaxy s4 for verizon lost a
couple of points for adding bloatware
and lost a couple more for removing
various features available in the other
versions of the phone but still commands
a solid eight point four out of ten
that's going to wrap up this quick
review but we've got a lot more
information about the Verizon edition
and the other editions of the galaxy s4
over
and now calm before you head on over
there make sure you give the video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw here
