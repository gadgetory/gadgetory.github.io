pocketnow.com here to bring you a quick
comparison of two photo editing
applications for Apple's iPad Adobe's
Photoshop Touch and Apple's own iPhoto
for iPad I'll do a quick overview of
each one and let you know which one I
would buy if I had to choose just one
it's pocket now now everyone it's
usually at this point where I say
something like I've been using these
applications for years and I know what
I'm talking about but really this is
weird considering I'm a tech editor I
have not used any advanced photo editing
applications I've really used basic
stuff like orphan View and I even build
stuff in preview on iOS so this was a
first-time experience for me on any
platform let alone just a tablet so I'm
gonna make plenty of mistakes and so
forth but if you're a first-time user of
this software as well this comparison
will be perfect for you
so let's dive in so let's go ahead and
start with iPhoto we're gonna be just
doing some edits on a pretty scenic
photo I took with the iPads own camera
in New York State in the United States
you notice iPhoto is run with these
icons that run along the bottom of the
display
they have no labels to them unless you
call up the help screen which we'll
discuss later so you kind of just have
to feel your way through if you're
running it for the first time and you
don't run the help screen which most
people do it's like reading the manual
not a lot of people do it so you can
kind of tap around and discover what the
app has to offer in that way you're not
gonna hurt too many things and you can
always undo which we'll talk about again
firstly you can change the orientation
using a pretty helpful little dial on
the bottom of the screen there if you're
not used to any kind of photo editing
applications you can use some sliders
down at the bottom there that interact
with each other to control brightness
contrast it takes a little getting used
to but you get the hang of it eventually
once you figure out exactly how that
interface paradigm works yet more
unlabeled controls along the bottom of
the display appear if you pull up the
color palette these are just things like
flesh tone and green and blue levels in
the photo
not exactly self-explanatory
but you get the hang of that pretty
quickly now tapping the brushes icon
brings up an array of you guessed it
paintbrushes which lets you do things
like saturate desaturate lighten darken
etc look I just unintentionally created
a burned through area on the photo but
you can probably do better than I the
final button on the left there is a
bunch of pre-built effects that you can
use to apply to the photo poor-man's
filters getting a little bit more
comfortable with cozy up to the rest of
the application here or at least try to
but we're not doing too well with the
control interface so there's a handy
little question mark up in the upper
left hand corner of the screen you go
ahead and tap that and you get a fairly
standard how-to menu which includes some
nice things like screenshots and labels
and things of that sort if you're
looking for inline help while you're
using the app you can tap another button
up top and that gives you labels for all
the buttons which would be great if they
were there to begin with but what are
you gonna do in the end we have a fairly
oversaturated contrast II blown out
photo that looks nothing like real life
but which I could definitely improve on
if I spent more time with it let's see
how Photoshop is different first thing
you'll notice is that Photoshop launches
in landscape as opposed to portrait mode
and your mileage may vary but personally
I prefer this it's a lot easier to work
on photos in landscape mode as I tend to
take more landscape photos if you take a
lot of vertically oriented photos that
might be different for you
or if you just prefer working in
portrait that might be different and the
next thing you notice is that you're
given the option to begin a tutorial or
begin a project now as I mentioned
before many people seem averse to
tutorials and manuals and help screens
and all that and I am no exception I
went ahead and created a project and I
bumbled around for about five minutes
and created a masterpiece of ridiculous
nonsense which was fun but it yielded
unimpressive results so I went back a
step and swallowed my pride and began
the tutorial and what I found was
unexpectedly delightful Adobe has really
put a lot of effort into making a
tutorial that is easy to use
for each individual effect that it wants
to teach you steps will appear in
sequence on the bottom bar you can
advance or go back using buttons on the
right it's a very self-explanatory
system occasionally tips will appear via
a pop-up dialog that manages not to be
intrusive because they're usually
relevant and useful tips and they
usually address a question that you are
just about to ask aloud to yourself also
handy call-outs pop up in smaller
windows to show you where to tap and
what to do
now tutorials exist for applying a lot
of different effects to photos and
they're all pretty uniformly helpful and
fairly easy I was surprised at how
quickly I could apply effects to certain
photos now more advanced uses like
carving out this woman from this photo
and putting her onto a separate
background proved to be a little bit
more daunting partially because of the
difficulty in using the iPad instead of
a mouse and pointer or a Wacom tablet or
some such and also because of my
beginners ineptitude fortunately there's
always an undo button available just
like in iPhoto when I get tired of being
inept at carving out the woman from the
background I decided to change the color
of this sky with another tutorial which
is something I would have done before
and preview by changing the color
balance of the entire photo but with
layers and with fading you can change
just the color of the sky it's just one
of many things you can do until
eventually you end up with a masterpiece
like this you too can be a real artist
someday if you try hard I'm just joking
of course it's junk but just like my
overexposed photo before wasn't I photos
fault
this isn't Adobe's fault it's just me
being a beginner playing around and I'll
get better I promise
more importantly I want to get better
because using this application is a lot
of fun
so what do they have in common they're
both apps that offer a lot more
functionality to help you get a lot more
from your photos but they also each have
a pretty steep learning curve if you're
a first-time user a Photoshop Touch
might be a little more complex but its
tutorial features are amazing and really
helped me feel comfortable with the
software after only about a half-hour
plus it's a more powerful application
letting you work with layers something
not many other apps give you the power
to do finally once you get used to photo
shops user interface you then have a
solid foundation for Photoshop on the
desktop in case you ever decide to
upgrade to desktop class photo editing
between the two the price difference is
notable Photoshop is $9.99 and double
the cost of iPhoto at $4.99 but look
either way you're spending at least $5
on an app so if it were me I'd spring
for the extra fiver get a much more
fully featured app for my money in
Photoshop but that said if you can get
both do so they're each convenient fun
and useful in their own way in different
circumstances
we hope you enjoyed this quick overview
of iPhoto for iPad and Adobe's Photoshop
Touch if you have a comment something to
contribute if you're an advanced user or
a beginner user if you saw something
that needs correction or something that
you just liked or didn't like drop us a
