better with pocket now and today was a
good day right about the end of it I was
greeted by FedEx with this box and boy
do I know what's in here
bear with me there is a reason why we're
doing this unboxing like we used to in
the old days I have to get on a plane in
a few hours yes I know I need sleep the
problem has already tried this box
doesn't fit in my bag and I am excited I
can't wait until then to unbox this
phone and I can't make you guys wait so
let's get to it this is the unboxing of
the BlackBerry key 2
and yes I have been asked by everyone
why am I so excited about the key to I
guess for me it has to do with nostalgia
I do agree it is a niche product but
bear in mind I am part of that niche I
use blackberries for years right about
from the time of the Pearl all the way
over to the BlackBerry Bold 9900 which
was my favorite one and yes I did want
to love the blackberry key one I know a
lot of my fellow reviewers did but the
keyboard was just too mushy for me and
that phone seriously needed more RAM it
was slow to take photos and ton of
things were just not there so I hear
that this phone is supposed to fix all
those things so this is the reason why
I'm looking forward to this review
period let's dig in you know what I
actually think this is fairly
appropriate retro style unboxing for a
retro style phone
all right Oh for some reason I thought
we were gonna get a prototype or
something but it seems that this is a
finally unit
it says blackberry keeps whoo and great
but you can barely see it yes this is a
final unit got a key to Athens huh
silver yes this is definitely the color
that I wanted some ejector tool a
literature that most of you won't really
care about we've got a wall adapter and
I believe this is quick charge but it
doesn't say anything so I'll let you
know in the review oh we've got will
lack Barry style headphones interesting
and your typical USB C cable love that
everything is in black makes it more
convenient and shotgun microphone is set
let's do this
oh yeah that felt really good so far
after a few minutes of using this phone
I have to tell you I am really looking
forward to this review period I'm not
saying that this is the perfect phone
I'm not saying this phone is right for
you I'm just saying that I fall in the
nation people that actually care about
this device
I want it to love the key one it was
great for things like battery life and
I'm looking forward to that with this
device as well again there is really
only one way to find out and that is
