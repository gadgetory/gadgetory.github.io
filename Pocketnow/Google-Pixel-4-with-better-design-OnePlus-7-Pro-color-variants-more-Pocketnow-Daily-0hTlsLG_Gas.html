take design more seriously after the
pixel 3 Excel design flopped someone at
Best Buy forgot that the pixel 3a isn't
out yet and put some boxes on the
shelves and we have new leaks of the
color variants of the 1 + 7 bro and it
looks really interesting I'm hey Matt
are Iveta and I was complaining
yesterday about the weather in New York
because it was great it's been raining
all day
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the iPad Pro and you
really don't care about getting the
latest generation currently less
generations iPad pros are I would say up
to three hundred and eighty dollars off
at B&amp;amp;H it depends on the variant you
picked whether it's a cellular or Wi-Fi
variant regardless these are really good
tablets you can learn more about it in
the description now let's talk about
Apple watch as something very
interesting in the quarter results call
was the market share being revealed
thirty five point eight of the market
percent of the market actually currently
owns an Apple watch meaning one in every
three smartwatches out there is an Apple
watch and that is a huge deal
considering the fact that there are so
many competitors with better designs but
sadly not a better operating system and
I didn't think this way before series
for now I kind of do now let's talk
about the oneplus 7 pro as we are
getting closer to the event and we get
more and more leaks this time we get
color variants one of them being blue
and the other one being silver which I
don't remember of a oneplus device being
blue in the past and neither do I
remember silver they always go for
either black or like purple colors or
you know at some point we had different
variations for the McLaren Edition so
yeah we'll see what colors we get I mean
I'm really looking forward to the blue
but obviously we never know what review
units we're gonna get now let's move the
spotlight over to Google with their
pixel 3a pics or 3a Excel as a well we
still don't have a date for when we're
getting the product I have no clue were
actually gonna see it at Google i/o or
not next week what I do know is that at
Best Buy recently it was put on store
shelves and I don't know if people
actually were able to buy it or if
a price tag but it showed up in the
leaks so this pretty much confirms the
packaging and apparently the color
options I'm not excited for the phone
but then again I could be wrong
and finally the hottest edition said I
have to do actually with Google and the
feature of the design of the pixels and
definitely one of my biggest criticisms
with the pixel 3 Excel was that it was
beautiful from the back
not at all from the front like from the
front that's probably the ugliest phone
out there and it seems that Google
pretty much noticed because their sales
have flopped up to the point that there
are three design departments out there
that are working on the feature design
of the pixel which for me is great but
in today's comments let us know what do
you think what would you change about
the design of the pixel for for you to
pick one because three design firms and
Google's gonna pick one in my case just
give me a screen without I don't care if
it's not without bezels but no notches
no chins man come on that and give me
the stereo speakers or whatever and
second keep the back just give me more
cameras that's just me leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
