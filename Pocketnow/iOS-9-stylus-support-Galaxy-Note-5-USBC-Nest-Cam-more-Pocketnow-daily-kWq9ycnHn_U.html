for legacy devices WWDC kind of hints to
an ipad stylus in the works and it seems
that nest is going into the camera
business I'm high in metairie vetta and
I apologize for the noise outside guys
is pouring rain here but the show must
go on this is pocket out daily the
official in this today are kind of
concerning as a new study conducted to
some Samsung gear smartwatches that are
not Android wear and LG Smart Watch is
that our Android wear apparently not
getting encrypted data meaning if you
get an email forward it to your
SmartWatch that information is not
encrypted and can be pulled in its
entirety from the SmartWatch which is
definitely a security issue so long as
somebody's actually intending to look
for the stuff on your watch just make
sure nobody steals it too and as Google
i/o and that we were clear that Google
takes the internet of things seriously
up to the point that there is project
brillo weave and other protocols to make
this work and some reports claim that
apparently nest is bringing a new camera
and the company acquired Dropcam a few
months ago but we haven't seen the
results of this and it seems that the
company's event next week is actually to
launch the next or the nest cam their
next nest cam I know but yeah it seems
that this product is coming we're not
exactly sure what's going to be cool
about it but stay tuned now some
interesting developments have surged
with iOS 9 at WWDC the event is still
happening in San Francisco and as it
turns out it seems that iOS 9 has this
new tool that allows developers to not
support legacy devices that are running
a 32-bit processor meaning if you
currently have an iPad 2 or an iPhone 4s
or an iphone 5 and these don't have a
32-bit processor this application may
not be available to you in the App Store
which is really interesting it makes the
job easier for developers as they built
powerful stuff for powerful devices but
it does mean that you should probably
upgrade now now other interesting
developments in iOS 9 are the fact that
it now supports predictive touch which
interestingly is technology you need for
a stylus to work on it so yeah it does
seem that Apple is working on a stylus
we've seen pants we
any everything but now that we see the
code now that we see apple's new notes
application supporting doodles i guess
we know where things are going and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day we've got more details on the
galaxy note 5 we're still ambiguous with
the reports of a 4k display but these
are hurt again but it seems that samsung
will jump the gun to USB type-c with the
galaxy note 5 in addition to the fact
that the company plans to bring a
whopping 40 100 million power battery to
this device you're definitely great news
we sadly haven't heard more of what to
expect for the Galaxy Note lineup but we
should learn more at e4 which is
happening in the next couple of months
and it does lead me to the question of
the day what would Samson need to bring
to the galaxy note5 for you to want to
acquire it because in my case it would
be the fact that they don't change the
mentality leave a replaceable battery
leave the expandable storage but that's
just me leave us a comment down below
it's your case friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is still
machine follow us on out comment
subscribe to channel as well get follow
me on twitter i underscore iveta please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am I metairie better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see it's more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
