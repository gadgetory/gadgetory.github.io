here in New York City for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 launch event this is just a
really quick and dirty video I'm working
with camera audio there's no editing
this is just going up very raw so we can
show you a very quick impression of the
US version of the Galaxy s3 at the
international version the 18 t version
and the sprinklers in here with me just
gonna do some app launch comparisons
maybe a few maybe a benchmark if we can
get a data connection to work for for
long enough just gonna give you a feel
for how these devices are similar and
how they're different like I say there's
no editing in this video so there's
nothing to cover up this really ugly pen
we have to do here but that wasn't too
too bad it seven and here are three
devices for the day this is the
International Galaxy s3 that I've been
working with for a couple of weeks is
the AT&amp;amp;T version is this print version
obviously from a hardware perspective
there is not a lot different with these
devices in fact they are identical they
are effectively identical I can find no
visual differences in them except for
the Qualcomm sticker on top of the
branded versions here but they are all
powered off here's the International
here is the TNT version here is the
sprint version there are some
significant differences under the hood
the international version here has a
Samsung Exynos quad-core processor with
one gig of ram but the u.s. versions are
each rockin the Samsung s4 excuse me the
Snapdragon s4 from Qualcomm which is a
dual-core processor
the advantage is LTE the disadvantage is
the loss of two cores obviously but
these are backed up by double the RAM
there are two gigs of RAM in each of
these devices which Samsung informs us
as an industry first so that's a pretty
cool thing we're gonna try a boot test
here it's really hard to press three
buttons at once but I'm going to give it
a shot one two three
Wow that was pretty good okay so already
the quad-core international version is
running the Samsung boot animation here
it's definitely spoiler alert probably
gonna beat the other two these guys have
the carrier animations to go through a
sprint an ATM teach to their little
colorful animation and we're already
ready to use here and almost connected
to the network and now we are connected
to the network on the international
version while the carrier versions here
we go these guys just woke up and became
usable so obviously there's that as I'm
mentioning we have some data issues here
these two units one of them is connected
to the network the other is not but I'm
having some Wi-Fi trouble here at this
particular venue so we want to just do
one or two apple launch comparisons to
show you the speed of app launching and
how it's similar 1 2 3 4 the camera 1 2
3 boom very very similar these are just
info screens because it's first used
very similar I should mention that these
devices are all starting from basically
a fresh out-of-the-box condition I did
do a factory reset on the international
one before I tried any of these tests I
wanted to do the data centric ones I
wanted to do a map launch an internet
browser launch but we're gonna have to
wait on that until we do a proper
comparison video and we have a little
bit more time but just to launch let's
see contacts here that's a pretty big
app 1 2 3 as you can see this you'll
have to take my word for word for now
this has kind of been my experience with
absolutely every interaction with these
devices the launch
times are very very very comparable in
spite of the fact that these are working
with processor of theoretically half the
power maybe because of the extra gig of
ram in each one I'm not sure like I said
we'll get into that more a little bit
later on now let's see if we can pop
open one more app for you let's see if
we can do the gallery the graphically
intense gallery application oh
well sorry about that I beat it beat
myself to the punch on
one and there we are so that's that
let's see if we can get the quadrant
benchmarking application to run here one
two three boom now we're going to run
every type of benchmark there is on
these devices but for now so we don't
have a ten minute video showing you a
bunch of three phones or running a bunch
of benchmarking apps we'll just go ahead
and run quadrant one two three and then
that goes and I'll run the other tests
off-camera and I will include the
results of Linpack and n22 and so forth
in the in the post at pocketnow.com so
here in a processor intensive
application like quadrant we're
obviously seeing that the the quad-core
device running at a higher clock speed
is just a little bit ahead of its
brothers seeing the usual doom like
animation here and while these are
running just show you the the back of
the device again very very carefully
once again the international version
this is the carrier branded AT&amp;amp;T version
and the carrier branded Sprint version
interestingly the carrier versions have
the Galaxy s3
branding at the bottom here whereas the
international version does not if you're
interested in those kind of things
devices are now going to warn me that
the results have to be sent to a web
service to compute the final score yes I
would like to proceed I don't think it's
going to let me proceed because I'm not
connected to a network here no house
connected that one so I can connect here
to my own a hotspot some reason I'm
having some real trouble connecting to
the Wi-Fi hotspot being issued by my by
my Galaxy Nexus so I don't think we're
gonna be able to get in on that one but
that's okay we'll just compare the
Sprint version and the international
version here the international version
earning a 5653
the Sprint version a little bit lower at
4848
like I said we're gonna run some other
benchmarks for you we're gonna get a
whole lot more time with these devices a
whole lot more detail but I wanted to
get this up right away so you can see
the differences and the similarities I
should mention before I go that there
are pebble blue variants these are all
white just from sheer coincidence these
are the demo units that that the that
Samsung had on hand for us obviously
very thankful for that stay tuned for a
lot more coverage at pocketnow.com and
watch the YouTube channel page here as
well we're gonna have a lot more
in-depth stuff this week next week and
for many weeks to come thanks for
watching guys we'll talk to you a little
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
