one and yes we know reviews have long
gone out on this thing but go around to
each and every outlet and you'll see
that they're all units bound to the
Chinese market and thus lock Google Play
services so on the edge of the N ones
international release with Google Play
services we're taking Nokia's AOSP
software for a spin what works what
doesn't and what might be next I'm
Jill's Wong with pocket now let's find
out what we have in the Nokia and one
before play our n 1 review unit comes to
us courtesy of 28 Mobile ringing you the
most sought-after mobile devices in the
world no matter where in the world you
are if you want to get your own n1 hop
on over to 28 mobile com and while
you're there tell him pocketnow sent you
it's all about the software in this
video and to be honest I wasn't really
impressed with the Nokia Z launcher
considering that I have so few apps i
rotate around on the whole and that the
launchers handwriting detection really
wants you to write diligently and not
naturally I guess I gave it a pass and
reverted to the standard lollipop
launcher nokia applied a minimal skin
over android bringing a proprietary app
store the boot we just installed an
update that came within hours of press
time that mostly changed what was going
on with the end store previously nothing
would appear when you open the app while
the system language was set to English
that they fixed that bug and gave a
friendlier Assad to the whole thing the
end store will remain mostly useless to
people who don't understand Chinese so I
went ahead and side loaded the amazon
appstore and download it whatever
android app i could that didn't rely on
Play services for the most part what it
could grab from the store and worked to
satisfaction if you want to discover new
apps to use though tread carefully
because whatever app store you happen to
peruse keep in mind that their sales and
permissions policies are probably more
relaxed than noodles
and you might be setting yourself up to
some unwanted exposure but the core of
all this really cuts down to access to
essential google apps or finding
substitutes for them that is what we're
trying to replace without Play services
after all I decided to try the most
obvious way around by using the web
browser improved feudal for the most
part as both the onboard browser along
with dolphin left us hung up on opening
documents and drive export thank you Dr
scrolling around Maps or trying to leaf
through of google play book youtube on
the web well extremely fiddly and
unstable was at least functional on both
the mobile version as well as the
desktop though with mobile the
resolution is knocked down to something
along the lines of 360 p and on the
other side desktop mode failed at full
screening so you'd have to zoom into
your player as much as you could and not
touch the screen lest you desire
disruption also disappointing is the
fact that there is no native voice
command functionality no ok Google now
camping a microphone icon no support for
no nothing because apparently most voice
data transmissions rely on Google Play
services to be clear you can use sound
input for search engines that don't
necessarily go through google say sound
oh there are substitute apps out there I
guess they kind of work 195 broadway
somerville massachusetts yeah not really
the brights part of this place our
vistas desert is with gmail on the web
at the full fledged saving grace when
compared to the AOSP email client which
doesn't thread responses properly and
just isn't smart enough anyways but
let's come back to reality here the
Nokia and one makes no business doing
what a can't
do without Google Play services and for
some reasons that might just render this
capable machine unusable put to the
shelf waiting for root will be watching
out for that will keep tinkering around
with a tablet and update you when we can
load an international rom on this thing
