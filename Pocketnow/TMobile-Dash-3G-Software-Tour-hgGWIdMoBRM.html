and we're going to take a look at the
software tour of the t-mobile
- 3G here we are with the home screen on
windows mobile 6.1 got the big clock up
top nose we also have 3G on t-mobile
that's a nice first panel it's a clock
on a date and you'll know something
right away it's different than the snap
we have our my faves down here so those
get downloaded straight from the
t-mobile servers if you've already set
them up and you can change them here of
course and one thing that was really
annoying is that it also puts these
people's birthdays in your calendar
along with a link to violent presents
and it got lots of duplicates in there
for some reason so I had to turn that
option off and delete those but uh so
that's nice we got my face and next
panel is your you know your notification
- if you're up here you see them as just
little icons with numbers to go down you
see your missed calls
you see 106 6 or 6 you can scroll
through left to right to see what else
you got missing here's your email
accounts MMS messages text messages
shows picture of your contact no new
voicemails and miss calls next one is
your calendar right you can see where
your next appointment is right there and
you scroll down to it and you can see
206 so you can scroll to the other ones
next down here is your messages again so
it's kind of strange to have it there
twice those are text messages you can
also access a new message so that's a
quick way to get a new message there and
here is your email and this is kind of
like a unified inbox of unread messages
so you can really easily scroll through
all your unread messages from you know
all your accounts all in one place so
that's nice next is the Windows Live
panel this is an option that you can
turn on when you sign into Windows Live
and got your contacts are online live
search connected and synced next is a
custom weather panel this is from HTC if
I click it with the trackball we get a
more five-day forecast
I go down another one you got Internet
Explorer with access to your favorites
next one is play all songs now if you
remember on the snap it opened it opened
a HTC's audio manager but with this one
we have it linked to the Windows Media
Player which is I prefer because Windows
Media Player responds to voice
recognition where's the audio manager
didn't and after that so you see the
album art shows up there when it's got
media player plane you can scroll
through
you click it again that'll play that
song guess it went to my other private
anyway there we go
and again deposit next is a getting
started panel this is for beginners to
you know help set up your device I've
got some these are all links to help
files that give you instructions and the
last one lets you remove this panel so
you don't want it taking up space if you
already know all those things that's one
of these settings you can change your
profile taxes con manager for Wireless
change ringtone tap manage your
background picture let's go to the comm
manager this is the HTC customized nice
red background a match can turn all
these normal things on and off so that's
good I'm going to start menu with the
left soft key right now I have the
recent programs list turned on this is
an option by default the recent programs
are not listed here just go straight to
all programs see if there it says recent
programs and this lists now recent
programs that I've used and here's a
trick you can actually actually have
shortcuts to these programs you see how
it's the four icons on top and then for
their if I type the W it goes to the
first icon e second RT that's that those
letters represent the first four icons
there and then these s DFG represent the
second row if I press S it goes right to
that voice command icon which is in the
first column of the second row and this
works also in the all programs listing
so see here I want to go to the instant
messaging just press energy
and it selects it right away and these
are some added programs on the - 3G and
get aim Google Talk my speciality I am
and Yahoo live mister you know normally
comes with Windows Mobile so that's
their - you also have a nice my account
icon which brings you to a nice little
claim that shows how many minutes you
use how many text messages you've used
you know how many you're allowed to on
your t-mobile account that's really nice
we got an applications folder this is
kind of putting some of your other
applications in a way out of the main
program folder on the Y but I guess to
clean it up a little have some internet
applications you got hand dangos so
there's your App Store included which a
lot of people don't know that when this
mobile has an app store already and you
got your camera photo and video album
this is a custom HTT program it's very
similar to what we saw in the original
touch diamond
except it's not touchscreen and we can
tap on a picture you can scroll to the
side and you can zoom with the soft keys
nicely animated so that's pretty nice
now it's got a video recorder sent audio
postcard setup email is a t-mobile
customized little wizard for setting up
yahoo mail Gmail now so make it easier
for new people oops to ask manager of
course commander Eric saw nice
management the usual suspects Wi-Fi I
would think this would be something to
set up t-mobile hotspots but it just
goes straight to the comm manager again
now these are some programs that I
installed being a wallet Facebook
actually becomes with Google Maps and
live search and this is an old version
of live search so when you start it up
it tells you to you know there's a newer
version available and you can download
it and that turns out to be bane so now
you've got to live searches installed a
new bin in an old live search my fave
settings you can change your my faves
right there quick GPS is to get you know
if former old data from the satellites
also comes with TeleNav a voice prompt
GPS navigation program to Kuakini I
installed YouTube it also comes with
let's open that this is a HTC customized
program I can scroll
and I can go look at the HTC snap
software tour connecting I think I have
it on high quality setting so it might
take a while
buffer let's see how it does
41% editor all right let's take too long
okay good
now this also comes with a new version
of Internet Explorer which supports
flash let's see if I can get to site
here I see I'm using keyboard shortcuts
to
I'm going to go to Johnny Utah's so you
want to go get some barbecue and do some
mechanical bull-riding I'm going to go
this website and it's all flash take a
couple minutes to load maybe and the
trackball works pretty nicely there we
are
there's your flash coming in
if I hold down the trackball I get a
menu if I press number two goes full
screen so this is great if you got
embedded videos you want to watch them
fullscreen it works you know excellent
here so that's about it for the software
tour on the t-mobile
