pocketnow.com
and in this video we're gonna compare
the homescreen interfaces of the four
operating systems that are out there
right now for mobile devices so we have
webOS running on the Palm Pre Plus on
Verizon we've the Google Nexus one here
running on Android 2.1 windows mobile
6.5 point three on the HTC hd2 and of
course iOS here on the iPhone 3GS so
we're gonna step through all of these
devices and talk about the philosophy
behind all of these homescreen
interfaces and try to determine which
one makes the most sense although of
course in the end it's very subjective
which one works the best for you so it's
clear away these devices and start with
the iPhone as we know by now the iPhone
is a very simple interface and that is
Bella we can slide to the right to
unlock and then we are presented with
icons and more icons and more icons and
of course you can move the icons around
on the screen you can add internet short
internet shortcuts here you cannot add a
shortcut to dial somebody quickly which
is kind of annoying Apple obviously
believes that you should be going into
programs to do anything on your device
so you can't see quickly your next
appointment or go preview your email or
anything like that everything requires
another step to get into the application
of course you can jailbreak your iPhone
you can get a lot of information such as
whether a next appointment or a quick
look into your email right on your home
screen but of course that voids your
warranty and that many people want to
jailbreak it's very likely that we're
gonna see a refresh to the home screen
interface of the iPhone coming up in
version 4.0 of the operating system but
for now
it's very application based and that's
it let's go to the HTC hd2 which takes
an entirely different approach HTC
believes that you should be able to
access the important data of your phone
right from the home screen so they've
created sort of mini applications all
along the home screen so you get your
favorite people here you have your
messages your email I don't have that
set up a panel for internet favorites
and you can search Google right from
here and then they have a new one here
for reading books so this really
prevents you from having to go into the
Start menu to launch any programs it's a
very interesting way of presenting the
interface the problem that I
always had with HTC sense or touchflo 3d
as they call it said it requires a lot
of finger travel so if I want to get
over to say the reader panel I have to
look down here and be very precise and
land right on the little reader icon
it's not always so easy to kind of do
that without looking well it's
impossible to do that without looking so
most of the time I spend here on the
home screen I like to add my favorite
programs right to this area so that I
don't have to be scrolling back and
forth to access different things but a
very unique interface from HTC Sense
where you don't have to join with
applications to check your email it's
all your favorite people look at your
photos listen to your music check your
calendar it's really all right here and
and it's really an interesting way to
sort of organize the homescreen let's
take a look at the Google Nexus One
which is sort of a combination between
the iPhone and the HD 2 so I'm gonna
unlock the screen here now with Android
devices and the Nexus One here we have
multiple home screen interfaces kind of
like the HD 2 although this is a lot
more customizable and we can have up to
two on the right and two on the left one
and then also five home screens where we
can add a variety of widgets widgets
that allow you to see the weather and
tap into Facebook and see your calendar
so it's a very customizable interface
and you can jump from screen to screen
by tapping and holding down here on
these dots and then sometimes it doesn't
work and then it gives you a little
preview of all of the home screens that
you have so you can quickly jump over to
the right and to the left we're hearing
that the next version of some Android
devices is actually going to have a
pinch functionality multi-touch on the
home screen that will allow you to zoom
out and see all of your home screens
sort of in one view now cool thing about
the the Android home screen here is that
you can add links to call people you can
add links to programs add links to
internet shortcuts you can have a
variety of widgets as we just saw a
quick way to access your communications
manager a Twitter widget a lot of
programs out there that you can get in
the Android application market actually
have an Associated widget so if you
really want to experience a program or
you can place its respective widget onto
your home screen and be able to access
it that way so very customizable Android
interface that kind of merges the iconic
based system of the iPhone
with the ability to access various
program functions and see your data
without having to drill into
applications like found on the hd2 now
let's take a look at the Palm Pre Plus
which of course is running webOS
software so we can slide to unlock here
so I'd say that the webOS operating
system is closer to the iPhone than
anything in terms of the amount of
information you get on the screen you
really don't get any information you can
customize four of these buttons down
here the way you do that is by tapping
and dragging by opening up the program
tray and then you can slide down another
application but you only get five
applications on the screen at one time
and of course you can access these at
any time when you're in an application
by tapping and gesturing upwards
which is a nice touch but again when
you're in your home screen you get to
see nothing but the open applications
and sort of four programs that you can
launch it's a little bit annoying
because you can't see your next
appointment or the weather again like
the iPhone you have to continually go
into various programs but fortunately on
the on Web OS you can have multiple
programs open at one time and so if you
really like to see your weather if you
really like to see your email you can
just keep them open as cards and then
access them by just tapping on them and
opening them that way and when you flick
away all the cards you are left with a
nice picture and not much else really so
if I were to write these home screen
interfaces against one another I would
say the most customizable is definitely
on the Google Nexus One or Android in
general you can really add widgets and
customize shortcuts and customize many
different home screens to access the
information that you need in terms of
eye candy I definitely give it to the
HTC Sense interface on the hd2 it
elegantly brings forth data and
information from various programs and
your photo viewer and other forms of
multimedia right on your home screen
interface which makes it a joy to use so
you don't have to constantly dig into
applications in terms of multitasking
obviously webOS is built around the
premise of these cards that allow
you to multitask but in terms of
usability there's not much you can do
with just four icons that you can change
on the bottom of the webOS interface and
finally the iPhone is probably the most
simple the most basic uncluttered way of
experiencing a smartphone you don't get
any choice in how these things look on
the screen you can't add any data but
again we're probably going to get a big
update for the iPhone interface that
moves past this just iconic based
interface in the near future so that was
just a quick comparison of the
homescreen interfaces of the four major
smartphone operating systems that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
