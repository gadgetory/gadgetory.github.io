they'd be more than likely to buy the
Apple watch Samsung decides to keep
things unchanged than its mobile
division and Huawei tells the world that
there is no money behind Windows Phone
I'm hi I'm Adam iveta and believe it or
not I am positive this monday and i know
that's odd this is parking out daily the
official news today are definitely
interesting samsung was going to have
this corporate shake-up of executives
because of the terrible resort in the
previous couple of quarters and as it
turns out the company will not reports
have at the JK Shin will remain as the
company's a CEO for mobile devices and
no word on the connected home as we
heard that they were planning to merge
with a BK Yoon the other CEO let's see
how that goes and then when we talk
about rumors it seems that the we have
the first league photographs of the
Lumia mclaurin which is the code name
for the Lumia 1030 there were reports
that this product was cancelled and now
we get some leaked screenshots though
apparently these are of a sale in China
for the prototype but still it seems
that we are getting a five to six inch
display it seems that this display will
be 1080p and that the camera will be a
50 megapixels and provided by Toshiba
when it comes to the sensor other
interesting changes come in the form of
gestures air gestures it seems and
several reports claim that it's still
happening let's just see when now in
other news that are not so positive
Huawei has just come on record to slam
windows phone number one the company has
ditched its plans for the dual booting
windows phones and Android devices that
we talked about and the company is also
confirmed that the reason why is because
no OEM has made any money from Windows
Phone hence the reason why a lot of OEMs
are just moving away from the platform
it seems that Microsoft is the only
company that's having fun here though we
have yet to see why this inscription for
the full details on what Huawei had to
say let's put the spotlight over to HTC
we get to hear about the future of the
HTC One m9 which should be announced in
the next couple of months were pretty
much already in 2015 almost and what
changes do we have here no men
chinon design changes remember that the
design head is not the same guy anymore
so that'll probably change but other
than that it seems that we are getting a
new partner for audio it seems that
it'll be bows apparently the ultrapixel
camera will die apparently we're going
to get a 16 megapixel shooter with
optical image stabilization Thank You
HTC let's wait for next year and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
if you were as shocked as we were with
the claims that Apple was planning to
sell 30 to 40 million Apple watches
there are some surveys that claim that
it will apparently 4,000 people from the
US UK China and India were surveyed and
these were not necessarily iphone users
they were asked about the Apple watch
and ten percent of these claimed that
they'd be willing most likely to buy the
Apple watch and then we've got other
figures like twenty-five percent of
these people holding out to see what
they're getting and then thirty-seven
percent of the people the remainder
saying that they would get the samsung
gear smartwatch and that really leads me
to the question of the day have you
bought a SmartWatch do you have one
right now or have you bought one in the
holiday season are you planning one and
it's so tell us which one and why did
you buy it or if not does why have you
not bought a SmartWatch in my case the
Samsung gear live is what i use in the
original pebble but obviously for you
know reasons of my job even though i do
like them i am waiting to see what the
Apple watch rings but leave us a comment
down below tells your story friends you
know the drill if you want to give in
those earlier before this video with
snow machine follow us on pocketnow.com
