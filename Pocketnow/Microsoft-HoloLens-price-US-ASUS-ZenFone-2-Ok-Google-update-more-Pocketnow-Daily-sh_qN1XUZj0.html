allegations of the Apple watch sensors
with tattoos microsoft hololens gets
detailed and everything including its
crazy price tag and prepare yourselves
on your pockets for the isuzu zenfone 2
i'm hi meri that I and yes I am trying
to rush through Friday like there is no
tomorrow
this is parking out daily the official
news today after with a soos one of the
most anticipated products of the year is
the asou central - mainly because you
get a lot of options with the phone and
the price tag is really not crazy at all
or at least very affordably crazy which
is great and for those of you that want
the phone in the United States there is
an event scheduled on may 18th president
bytes have already been sent out so we
should hear which US carriers are gonna
be picking it up and what the price
points will be we'll keep you posted and
for those of you that have been waiting
for flagship Lumias for ever there are
some credible sources claiming there are
two models in the works codename talk
men and city men little beasts are
pretty much almost the same fell when it
comes to designs and appeal but
apparently specification wise we've got
a snapdragon 808 including three gigs of
ram in addition to 32 gigs of storage
that it's expandable and that display is
quad HD when it comes to the tockman but
when it comes to the city man it's
pretty much almost the same phone
apparently only this would be a 5.7 inch
tablet and yes this will run Windows 10
and full bells and whistles which is
actually a problem because we would have
to wait for the summer for that next up
let's talk about Google the company has
just made a silent update to its boquete
Google Command or Google search and it's
included support for third-party
applications so for example if you want
to listen to NPR radio we just say ok
Google listen to NPR and it'll tune into
the radio station
it works with TripAdvisor and a ton of
other services there is a source link in
the description that gives you the full
details on what you can do and yes you
could do this starting now it seems up
next let's talk about Apple one of the
biggest controversies lately is that
people that have tattoos in their wrists
are complaining the heart rate sensor is
not accurate and to that what Apple has
done is pretty much update its
information and claim that the app
you've got permanent ink on your arm you
sadly will not be able to get an
accurate reading
then again we do know that the heart
rate sensor on any SmartWatch is not
perfect anyways but I will suggest that
you can either swap your wrist use it on
the other hand or you can use the you
know that strap on for your chest for
you to be able to get an accurate
reading that actually does give you an
accurate reading but yeah those of you
wearing tattoos if you're looking for
accurate stuff it's not gonna be the
case but then again as I said earlier no
smartwatches and finally for the very
hot news of the day Microsoft's BUILD
conference is served for a lot of things
and we've covered most of them in the
pocket now daily but the most
interesting one is hololens it left more
questions than answers when it was
announced 90 days ago almost a hundred
days ago but now the company has a new
and a full post of everything that
hololens is what the sensors are what
specific processors it has and what it
is and what it isn't what it is is a
computer on your head it's not really
Google glass that tethers to your phone
this is a full-fledged computer on your
head that overlays that you are in front
of you in whatever it is that you have
in front of you and that adapts
depending on what you have which is
really cool the concept is very nice but
if you're wondering exactly what it
costs well it seems that it'll be priced
above any game console meaning yes above
$400 but then the cap was not given and
given the fact that gaming computers can
oscillate to almost $3,000 in some cases
it is a point to be worried about what
exactly will be the price tag of
hololens and it does lead me to the
question of the day how much would you
be willing to pay for hololens what is
the maximum amount of money that you
would pay for it in my case I really
don't know if I'd be willing to use
hololens mainly because there is nothing
practical about doing this to try to
manipulate things and see it's better to
use just the keyboard in a mouse in a
coop you know what display but then
again people would geeks so am i I'd be
willing to pay a thousand bucks that'd
be it but leave us a comment down below
what's your case friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news

followers I pocket out a comment
