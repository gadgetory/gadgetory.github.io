everything it's shocking just how much
you can learn from a product in the
first 24 hours I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
with PocketNow and these are our first
impressions of the Samsung Galaxy s7
brought to you by D brand ah the
honeymoon phase that moment will you
just unwrapped your new toy and putting
it down as more painful than anything
some devices do a good job at this and
some don't but so far the galaxy s7 has
taken the cake Samsung has done an
amazing job in improving the already
great build quality of its predecessor
and taking ergonomics to the next level
with this design from the metallic trend
to the curved glass surrounding it this
is one of those phones that calls to be
held constantly the build sadly isn't
without its flaws as fingerprint magnet
as the galaxy s7 second name so choose
your color wisely as we did with this
gold platinum variant setting it up for
the first time gave us a clear hint of
how powerful the internals are Samsung
has updated its logo animation for
something a little more artistic and
once the carrier logo kicks in the
device follows most of the same process
of last year's unit we did fumble with
restoring this unit from a previous
device for reasons we don't know but
after a few tries we were shocked at
just how fast the galaxy s7 loaded all
of our applications it's clear that the
snapdragon 820 processor matched with
four gigs of ram is here to make a
statement and so far so good
once inside were greeted by Samsung's
class-leading 5.1 inch quad HD AMOLED
display which continues to Marvel with
great contrast and saturation sure you
probably won't be a fan of the TouchWiz
being portrayed by it but there are some
great improvements here for starters
samsung's new always-on mode which is
the only one we've seen with color
accents even though notifications don't
really benefit much from it from what
we've seen
Samson's game launcher is also here to
save you from accidentally pressing the
capacitive keys while you play and
marshmallow has done its fair deal of
good improvements here as well
we notice Samsung's adoption of the new
volume controls though the
do-not-disturb does require you to
enable the toggles separately as opposed
to how Nexus devices do it the
notification shade has also received the
subtle revamp in color and you now have
more control over notification banners
even though to a little more complexity
to stock Android Samsung has even
continued to push for more text with its
iconography as for example in the past
the camera application had HDR buttons
and now you see HDR on or off in the tar
goals which is rather weird other
options in our quick day of testing seem
to be the same Samsung's famous theme
store is still an option and this is one
of the few devices that actually takes
advantage of that quad HD display by
allowing you to split-screen multitask
in addition to also bring little things
like allow you to control the screen
grid for more applications on your
launcher we'll dig deeper into more of
these in our full review over the next
few days what's been most shocking so
far is actually the experience of using
this phone over a day things like
battery life have proven to be a major
improvement over last year's predecessor
yes it probably won't get you through
more than a day but last year's galaxy
s6 would already crawl by 4 p.m. so far
we've been testing this phone over a
period of ten hours of mix Wi-Fi and
data with long phone calls email and
video and we still have 30 percent of
battery life to show for something that
the previous device would just not be
able to accomplish storage management
was also better than on rumors but he
claimed that this phone would eat up
half your storage with bloat but after
loading all our applications games and
music I still have about half the
storage to play with and there's also
microSD support for added peace of mind
last year's experience with the camera
was already good but we've already begun
noticing some great performance
improvements even over gloomy New York
City after a winner and the speed at
which this camera focuses and takes
photos is just plain
we haven't really noticed major
differences in color saturation or the
resulting photos of the camera but speed
and performance are always great
improvements overall again it's really
too early to call this a class leader
but our review period has just begun we
still have to exit this honeymoon phase
in order to have the nerve to test it
when wet and we still have to see how
well it handles daily driver tests as we
load it with more stuff going forward
expect more details in the next coming
days as we compare it to every heart
smartphone in the market as we prepare
for our full review looking for a way to
add some grip and eliminate those
fingerprints from your new Galaxy s7 or
