new Google home and even a pixel book
have just emerged but watch Series three
early users claim that there are some
heavy LT problems and Amazon seems to
want to put Alexa and wearables and
we're actually not talking about watches
I'm Jaime Rivera and storm warnings in
New York are funny you get alerted by
the wind before the authorities and then
when the authorities alert you it stops
raining and the Sun comes out this is
PocketNow daily the official loose today
begin with deals to a certain degree
those of you in the market for the
galaxy s 8 plus you still find that for
rather expensive price tag right now but
daily steals currently offers the galaxy
s 8 plus refurbished for $500 yes I know
you can get the galaxy and certain
carriers for that amount of money but
again we're talking about the plus
though again it's a refurbished unit if
you're interested you can learn more in
the description now let's talk about the
Apple watch series 3 as our unit is
scheduled to arrive on Friday and we're
already hearing complaints of LTE
connectivity and you know I read that
this thing only offers one hour of LTE
phone calls that it just makes sense
that the battery is not able to keep up
but apparently it's not just that the
watch also has trouble remaining
connected and it has to do with the
transfer between Wi-Fi Nell T it seems
to be a glitch that Apple is apparently
working on so stay tuned as your watch
might not work as expected when you
unbox it and speaking of wearables we
hear that Amazon is working on its own
wearable but not a SmartWatch we hear
that the company is working on bringing
us Alexa to eyeglasses and regular
looking eyeglasses not Google glass not
snapchat spectacles glasses you'd
actually be willing to wear and not look
dorky now how exactly is this going to
work or is it going to Brig augmented
reality is really hard to predict just
yet but we'll keep you posted we should
learn more soon now bear in mind because
of the storm warning we actually
recorded this video early just in case
it started raining so at the time of
this recording we heard speculation that
HTC is apparently going to be acquired
by Google up to the point where the
Taiwanese stock market has considered
actually stalling that stock because
apparently the
position is going to happen now bear in
mind we've been hearing rumors about
this but we've also been hearing rumors
that HTC is not selling the smart phone
division but their vive division and
these are two markets that Google offers
so it could just be that it's buying one
thing or it could just be that it's
buying everything whatever the case may
be I'm not exactly sure that that's the
best idea given the history of Google
with Motorola but hey stay tuned we
should be hearing something very soon
though it would make sense for these
news to be held until the pixel launch
and I said these names I know I'm sorry
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the entire Google pixel
lineup as we've just seen leaked renders
that show us a couple of things number
one the pixel smartphones that we had
already seen and leaked renders they
look identical that's great we get to
see a Google home Mini that is
supposedly an option to be offered aside
from the Google home it seems that both
are going to be sold and you're just
gonna get the option to buy this one for
50 bucks which is great but even more
interesting is this Google pixel book
and by pixel book it seems like a
replacement to the pixel see but we
noticed that it also has a smart stylus
being included how is Google going to
balance these products or if this is
going to be true or not is really hard
to predict but it does leave me to the
question today number one what do you
think about the products that you see in
the leaks number two do you think that
Google should change their launch cycle
and probably launch their products a
little earlier because I think the buzz
was completely taken by devices like the
Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 10 leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion and friends remember if you
