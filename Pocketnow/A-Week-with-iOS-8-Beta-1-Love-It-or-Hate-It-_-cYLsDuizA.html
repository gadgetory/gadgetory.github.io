8 beta 1 the forthcoming update from
Apple for its mobile operating system
which technically isn't available to the
public just yet we should see it launch
sometime this year later in the fall
maybe but how have we fared on iOS 8
what do we love what do we hate I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now this is
a week on iOS 8 following the WWDC 2014
keynote gung ho as I typically am I
loaded my iOS devices up with iOS 8 beta
1 without hesitation being in early beta
expected some bugs and glitches along
the way app crashing and random reboots
are pretty common in such early software
this beta in particular is very early a
lot of the most prominent iOS 8 features
apple announced are not yet live
basically you get the new predictive
keyboard the recent and favorite
contacts in the task switching menu the
pretty rad overhaul in Safari more
in-depth search function and spotlight
hands-free see reactivation so long as
you're plugged in and a few other odds
and ends like SMS sync and I message on
the iPad which was more useful than I
imagined it would be one of the most
useful features in iOS 8 without
question is actionable notifications
when a text message or new IMATS which
comes in hold a better notification down
and begin typing when you're done hits
in and continue what you were doing you
never have to leave the app it's one of
the most simple features imaginable but
it goes a long way in a thoughtful UX
currently this only works with first
party apps from Apple but when the full
iOS 8 is released third-party
applications will be able to take full
advantage of the feature the new
spotlight search is also pretty helpful
when it works I've had times where I
search movies and a few apps pop up in
the results other times when it works
like a should show times and theater
results will appear searches will return
Wikipedia articles IMDb entries nearby
locations and more finally spotlight is
far more useful than before even if the
results get jumbled in the single column
view the new keyboard called quick type
aims to learn and predict your text it
worked really well but what I'm truly
waiting for is third-party keyboards
swiftkey swipe menu etc the old tap to
type method is a little old and data
these days so far these are the only
features I've really fallen in love with
minor as they may be i'm looking forward
to third-party sharing third-party
keyboards and fully functioning
continuity other iOS 8 features I can
live without contacts and the tax
coaching page for instance it doesn't
make sense it feels like a poorly placed
afterthought a double press the home
button to switch apps not start a call
or message I feel this would be more
appropriately placed amongst the
upcoming widgets in the debut of
notification center or maybe in control
center family share doesn't directly
benefit me as I'm a single adult with no
children my girlfriend and I could share
apps if she had an iphone or ipad but
outside that I'm not the target user for
that particular feature health iCloud
Drive continuity extensibility and even
the hidden features found within the
code like split-screen multitasking and
more functionality and control center
all sound great but we'll have to wait
to see what they're all about for now I
prefer to both the ipad mini in the
iphone 5 back to iOS 7 mainly due to the
stability of the beta 1 i was out of
town and relying on my iphone which
fully froze three times and one night I
got stuck in the activation process for
over an hour once and some of my most
vital apps simply would not load like
Rdio so I reverted but I'll definitely
be trying the next beta release once it
hits there's a lot to look forward to in
iOS 8 even if beta 1 doesn't show it all
n is a little buggy tell us about your
