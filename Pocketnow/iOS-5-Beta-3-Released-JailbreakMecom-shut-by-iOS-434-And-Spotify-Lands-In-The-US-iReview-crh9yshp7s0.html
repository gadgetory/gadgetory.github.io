we're tired of the beta 2 disaster iOS
4.3 point for also gets released so
sorry jailbreakme com and Spotify
finally lands in the u.s. to show I toes
how it's them all the sim bar coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi I'm
going to be that and welcome to the park
and nail I review the show we go through
all this week school and they're not so
cool inside the world of Apple's iOS
devices let's start this week off with
the cool iOS 5 beta 3 finally got
released the developers though there
aren't many enhancements at SEC for the
fact that things are finally working in
most departments for example FaceTime is
finally working syncing itunes over the
Wi-Fi is finally working and while other
new things are coming for example one of
the things that was discovered was the
fact that you can now do airplay
mirroring of facetime calls through your
iPad 2 now remember the ipad 2 is not
something we cover here but first of all
the a5 chip is something that is coming
to the next generation iphone so we can
expect for facetime mirroring through
airplay on an Apple TV on your TV
widescreen TV with your next generation
iphone hopefully iOS 5 beta 3 is
currently a box of surprises a lot of
new things that are coming out so we'll
be covering them on next videos as we
discover them spotify finally lands in
the u.s. apps or to show iTunes how it's
done we were all expecting itunes in the
cloud to be a streaming service and we
got itunes match and that was pretty
much it for the next year spotify will
allow you to stream millions of songs
from their libraries and even your
iTunes library for five dollars a month
over there free application on your iOS
device and well if you're lucky enough
to have a friend that's already a member
and you don't mind the ads you could
probably get in there for free though
there's also this $10 premium service
that will allow other features so
Spotify is there it's here to stay and
well that's just the way to compete with
you know the amazon cloud player and
other services that are out there
offering streaming services that Apple's
neglecting
itunes this how you do it a recent study
has revealed that it's more interesting
to develop apps for iOS than it is for
Android and you'd ask why I mean there
are more Android devices out there then
there are iOS devices but it seems that
developers are inclining more towards
iOS 42 different new reasons first of
all well the ipad 2 being released and
aside from that the verizon iphone but
also the fact that there are more credit
cards in itunes then there are or that
it is easy to purchase apps in the
android market because i have to be
adding my information all the time every
time i want to make a purchase as
opposed to iOS is a way of purchasing
apps where you just have to click once
and that's it and well think about it I
mean it just seems to be that it doesn't
have to do with how easy it is to
develop apps for iOS it doesn't have to
do with the size of the market it has to
do with the size of the people that are
willing to buy and that's another really
interesting aspect of iOS users because
they don't mind paying and well
interesting and the cat mouse game
continues and we'll talk more about that
in a so cool section because yeah Apple
has already released a version of iOS
that will patch the jailbreakme.com
exploit and all the cool news is that
the dev team is hard at work they've
already released a new version of the
pottage tool that will allow a tethered
jailbreak of your iOS device if you
mistakenly upgraded to iOS 4.3 point for
sadly it's currently tethered for both
the jailbreak it's not as simple as
jailbreakme com and also you'll have to
be tethered whenever you have to reset
your device or whatever powers out or
stuff like that not really the best way
to remain jailbroken but I know a lot of
people rely on that so well at least
there's a solution while they bring it
unto their jailbreak and no sad news is
the fact that the ipad 2 is not covered
by that new appanage tool so sorry about
that
well that is our for the coolest
continuing on with the not so cool and
well yeah we started the news backwards
this time apple also released iOS 4.3
point for which is four point two point
nine for Verizon customers and the only
reason for this release is to patch the
exploit that allows jailbreakme com to
work so first of all keep in mind you're
not obligated to upgrade your iOS device
to iOS four point three point four you
can remain in four point three point
three and continue being able to
jailbreak your device wirelessly and
simply with Dell break me calm again the
only reason you'd want to upgrade us to
have the latest and greatest nothing
will happen to your device if you don't
but again that's a matter of choice you
choose what you do with your device
again this is you know the cat and mouse
game working apples trying to catch up
but we'll see what happens and while the
ITC has just ruled in favor of Apple for
two of the tenth pans that they sued HTC
for infringement and why is this not
cool well first of all I mean kind of a
weird way of competing I mean we're not
really sure what Apple will do with this
recent one obviously HTC will appeal and
we'll see what happens when that works
out because we don't really see Apple
banning HTC devices from coming to the
United States but still they're entitled
to if there is the patent infringement
over those certain devices that they
caught again really I mean Apple just
figure out a way to compete just bring
out another leapfrog product just like
you did on 2004 with the iphone 5 and
well make people catch up to you again
then we don't have to worry about
lawsuits or pens or people not being
able to buy the HTC devices that they
want because they're really cool just
because you don't want them to use
certain of your technologies I mean you
also borrow some of their technologies
on iOS four on iOS 5 sorry that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Jaime to be better remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
