support LTE advanced that will recruit
some old webOS employees to bring some
love to its UI and HTC announced its
want to mate for Windows and it is
exactly that I'm hi Natalie that I and
this message will self-destruct at
around three and a half minutes if my
calculations are correct this is parking
out daily let's begin today with what's
official as HTC has just unveiled the
butterfly to two other markets if you
remember the j butterfly was recently
announced for kddi in japan and as of
September's second the butterfly 2 will
also be available which is pretty much
the same device only available in other
markets and hopefully we will be getting
a droid barian to in verizon eventually
or any other variants in the United
States but yeah this is pretty much a
one inmates with better specifications
and a waterproof chassis which makes it
a really hot product to look forward to
another interesting official news pebble
is the company that has not decided to
adopt Android wear yet we wonder how
long it will take them but for now the
company has looked for another even
smarter approach they've just hired some
webOS employees in order to work on the
UX and the whole user experience and
this is a very interesting addition as
webOS was really great the design that's
biggest problem was the under power to
hardware but let's see how the pebble
you I will work eventually as hopefully
it'll bring some color and if you're
still considering a moto x don't forget
that the event is happening in the next
couple of days but the company is
looking for some deals they want to
obviously get rid of current hardware so
they're offering the Moto X with a
wooden back for the same price tag as
you're getting for the plastic bag which
is great even though again it's really
hard for us to recommend the Moto X
right now as the Moto X plus 1 or
whatever the name is going to be should
we launch the next couple of days and
even so the only reason why I would buy
this because we're not really sure if
there would be a wood back on this
future Moto X plus one now let's talk
about apple in the iphone 6 as we get
more leaks on the logic board and this
time it seems that Apple is upgrading
the Qualcomm LTE chip that will be using
for its cellular radio and what's most
interesting about the cellular radio is
the fact that it includes support for
LTE Advanced now bear in mind that
doesn't mean that
there will be the service activated on
the phone it means that the hardware is
capable so could it be that Apple is
planning to include this service for
everyone even if it's only available in
certain markets in Asia or could it be
that that's planning to have its own
primary phone as other OEMs are doing
but without the need of building more
hardware what we do know is that the
chip is capable but again it's kind of
pointless for the rest of the world and
finally for the very hot news of the day
HTC has just unwrapped that's one of
made for Windows and it's pretty much a
One m8 that runs windows phone this is
the same phone specifications and
everything which is actually a great
thing as the one I made as a great
design I don't think there was a need
for a change in hardware this is perfect
though we don't know if it'll dual boot
eventually the only problem with the
phone is that it's currently exclusive
to verizon for a hundred dollars after
to your contractor price tag is actually
not bad and it's a great phone for those
of you that want Windows Phone and that
want this design but that leads you to
the question of the day link the
description for our full video coverage
on this phone tell us what you think
would you buy one because in my
particular case I would love one but i
would even love it more if it could dual
boot but leave us a comment down below
