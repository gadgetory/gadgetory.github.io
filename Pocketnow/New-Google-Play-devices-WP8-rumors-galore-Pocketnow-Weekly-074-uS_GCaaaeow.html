technology the news cycle that never
sleeps but this week's been bigger than
most with Android and Windows Phone
vying for attention as each cap spouts
rumors galore those rumors plus a lot of
hard actual news have flooded the feeds
for the past six days and we've called
in a four-man team to talk it over on
today's episode of the pocket now weekly
the once a week audio podcasts where we
discuss mart phones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now welcome and
joining me for the fun listed in order
of proximity to me our chief news editor
Stephen shank ahoy-hoy to you what it is
jive brother senior editor Taylor Martin
top of the moonshine to you haha and I'm
multimedia manager Jaime Rivera down in
Honduras buenas tardes sir when I start
with Carlos who I didn't say it right at
all I shouldn't have high me on the show
he makes me sound bad is all sound like
that makes it all sound like what yeah
what we think about I don't know where I
was gonna go with that I hadn't thought
that far ahead like the whitest the
whitest kids you know but then no that's
a wonderful band actually but and yeah
you know what I mean hi I'm a how are
things down in Honduras I have somebody
starting a car beside me and it's really
noisy oh oh yeah they're having trouble
with their fan belt down there seriously
you're getting here at can't chin ah
hate it I feel like we very often start
the show with with an admonition to to
our listeners to be understanding to us
because we have a lot to get through but
for some reason like this week just
seems really overwhelming i'm looking at
the rundown and i can't remember one
being this long in like a really long
time and ironically like we have a way
of you on the air you're the iOS guy and
there's like one piece of i quit this
week it's annex not in it yeah it's not
news it's like hey Jaime did this video
you should go watch it but we'll get to
that when we get to that I guess Before
we jump in I'm going to we're going to
have a couple announcements here today I
would very much like to talk about them
in order and
I think we're gonna let jaime do the
last one but let's kick off the
announcements with a request to our
listeners we are it is improper to say
we're up for an award we are mainly
seeking a nomination for an award the
2013 stitcher awards are here stitcher
is an app listeners if some of you are
listening to us through stitcher right
now it's an app on several platforms
that allows you to stream podcasts and
it's pretty cool app I actually like it
they're not paying us to say that nobody
pays us we don't have any sponsors on
our little podcast but it's an app i've
been using in know exactly if anyone
would like to sponsor us including
gunnar optiks nominate us for a stitcher
award is my point i've been using
stitcher since 2009 on webos and i use
it on android now it's a cool app it's
free and for the second year in a row
they are having a series of awards you
can nominate us there's a description in
there's a link in the description it's
the second week in a row of done that
and you can nominate us in the field of
Technology if you want layer or best new
podcast or the best overall podcast if
you're if you're very kind but it sounds
a lot over there doesn't that sound a
lot better or best everything ever yeah
I mean I don't know if that would exist
but I I nominate that category you can
write in categories like yeah best
everything ever best refrigerator
repairman podcast so anyway we really
appreciate it if you guys would do that
you can the way it works is you can vote
everyday so if all the details are in
the link but you can vote once a day up
til december 24th I think and then the
nominations are announced on December
31st so please vote once a day I think
you have to click a facebook like but
like button to do it but I it's not
entirely clear whether you actually need
a Facebook account I think that's
basically their their capture system I
don't know Steven have you tried voting
Steven to you of a Facebook account I
have not primarily because of that
reason you should vote you should vote
Stephen for our show you should not vote
for us yeah I am a fan I guess you could
call it yeah I don't dislike it not
wrong to vote from us so no it's it's
right you have to do it it's like I
presidential candidate right you bonus
but if you want to vote for yourself
yeah you can vote everyday for like a
month long although I think that's a
pretty it's a pretty loud
to move for like if you're in Iran and
you vote for the other guy I think
that's a pretty classy move then you
lose by one vote does that ever happen I
don't think that ever happens cuz
politicians aren't classy no they're not
no so anyway that's that's the deal
there that's enough of us appealing to
your sense of charity but really know if
you like the show please vote for us
also happening this week pocketnow VIP
double O 4 is happening the fourth in
our interview series and this week we're
meeting mark from soldierknowsbest do
you guys have you think he's got like
six hundred thousand subscribers have
you guys watched his videos at all yeah
big fan I was gonna say like he's an iOS
dude so I'm his gotta speak up here it
yes I got a called out for copying him I
didn't even know he existed back when I
started my xbox live account and my my
gamertag is Casper knows best I had no
idea soldierknowsbest existed back then
and people like why are you copying
soldier I'm like yeah daddy knows best
wasn't that an old or father knows best

we wanna cheat meal and by the ID so did
I I think we got our first question for
the VIP where'd you where'd you use her
name come from brother you stole it from
my gamertag misleading yeah father knows
best 1954 I'm also going to conduct the
entire VIP using the Hulk Hogan voice
from the 80s if that is the tale right
here old early right now check out these
plans brother give me 20 yeah okay so
Ric Flair yeah yeah because you're gonna
peek us so don't do it right now I don't
want any was on the air right now we're
into this one uh watch although i did
thank you so which is a stay tuned for
that that's going up on friday and also
i did in the last in a series of
announcements you should watch the
pocket now daily you're listening to the
pocket now weekly but if you don't start
your day with the pocket now daily i'm
pretty sure you're doing it wrong hi
mate isn't that right or your night or
your night yeah the daily goes up at
obscene hours of the morning and don't
remind me don't behind me i actually
using the pocket daily question hymen
yeah
when do you sleep that's a good question
it is always awake like I send you an
email like my four a.m. and you're like
yeah man and like I wake up and i'll
send you an e-mail when i wake up and
it's i guess what like 6am there and
you're like a man like a what like we
didn't sleep I have the oddest sleeping
habits ever like for example it at five
at 4am that you wake up if you write me
at 4am that's 3 a.m. my time I sometimes
wake up to run at that time I know I
think we have a prestige situation going
on here we have a pair of twins filling
the place of one man and that's a great
movie I saw a man that's you just
creeped me out Stephen that movie is
definitely really loose but a great
movie i agree so why does the talking
out daily I generally do it to prepare
for this podcast so that I know what's
been going on the news sadly it doesn't
help very often I still don't know
what's going on in the news because
we've been in review mode for basically
ever but hiss what has it been like
three months I don't even like remember
what day or month it is right now I'm
just kind of like coasting that's every
40 minutes I have to stop and go away
what day is it cuz I have an idea so
I've got any ask well I have you guys
get your you know it sounds like
complaining I'm it right it sounds like
we're bellyaching about no I i still
love being buried under a flood of
devices and this was about to say stop
complaining you've got my shipping
address let me help speaking of which I
might have you yet received the Nubia
five it should arrive today but I'm
still waiting for them to call me up
soon all right Jaime rivers take a look
at the ZTE nubia 5 which is not a gone
down so if you just jumped right to
Android or Windows Phone you fanboys you
missed that bit of fun news I've seen a
number of readers asking us do we have a
25-20 review coming anywhere in the
pipeline so let's talk about that I
think I think we may have entered at
this but yeah they keep asking for my
review of the G pad 8.3 as well yeah so
we guys the review process does not
always go smoothly and sometimes that is
not in that is not directly our fault we
had trouble with our demo unit on the g
five times misery sometimes it is
so one of them was not our fault the G
pad 8.3 was not our fault that was a
faulty demo unit and we by the time we
would have gotten a replacement the
review would no longer have been timely
enough for us to basically get the
enough views to make it worth it i know
that sounds really horribly like guess
you know view count whore worthy and
stuff but ultimately we do have to make
some business decisions from time to
time so it's a shame are buried yeah and
it's a shame because Jaime as I recall
you really liked that I really did I
really did it was a really really good
tablet you know even with the software
and everything I feel that LG did a
really good job with it would it just
had a little bit of a bootloop problem
well right every time the thing would
discharge it would start a boot loop and
until it was fully charged that would
work again it was crazy Anna in in the
finest example of demo God like
pettiness when we sent it back to LG our
contact at LG was like yeah I I've been
like putting that unit through its paces
and I can't get her to I can't get her
to do anything wrong I'm like man demo
gods really damn you but anyway so
that's the story with that and then the
2520 was my fault we sent it via our
shipping career to Taylor because Taylor
was going to do the review because I was
buried and the shipping company lost it
oh that sounds like it would be their
fault but in fact it was my fault for
not insisting that a signature was
required so we've learned our lesson
very expensive lesson we are trying to
get another 25 20 but fortune open call
to anyone who has our 2520 i would like
to film a review please send it to yeah
she's that Mario if you would all right
please film the review we can meet ya
you know we can take that be somebody in
my complex or the the UPS guy or FedEx
guy or whatever but uh yeah it has to be
somebody who lives near me I mean in
fairness it was like the shadiest
situation ever when I dropped us because
i was in new york city for the pep com
event I think that Adam Lane and Brandon
I covered and like it was after that
event it was like the middle of the
night and like I have to get this out
right away so I was at this FedEx Office
location in the middle the night and
nothing was shady about the location
itself nothing seemed off but if
definitely I don't know I don't know
what happened
something happened that's like that's
like the first time ever I mean thanks
for so long but oh yeah and I just we
ship it's going to happen sooner or
later mmhmm yeah it's true we're
shipping multiple boxes back and forth
to each other all the time anyway that's
starting to talk about review logistics
which gets real boring so we're not
gonna talk about anymore we'll get a
25-20 replacement at some point folks so
thanks for your patience I may just
message me and he said he took three
naps during the discussion so that's how
he's nice oh and I'm it yeah I just got
home his message from nine minutes ago
sorry I don't pay attention to the chat
when we're understand so here we go guys
would say is everybody ready should we
jump into Android and start getting this
news taken care of no actually I'd like
to talk about a rain of savage and cut
off his mic damn I miss this I really
miss this oh it's so good to have you
back Thunder in paradise here's here we
go with the Android news and it's nice
because this the first show we're doing
where we have little sound clips for all
of the category leaders instead of just
listener mail by the way no listener
mail this week sorry team sad face uh
new google play devices holy crap did
anyone see this coming who wants to take
us through this news because I sure
didn't know that this was going to
happen Steven you want to tell us what
happened yeah sure um so this also
started out with when we first got
Inklings of a new version of the or what
seems like a new version the G pad 8.3
people thought it might be a new Nexus
tablet there was a leak it was very very
little info just had that LG name it was
a tablet and it said something about
google in this tiny little database
entry just like a blip on the radar I
got just really curious about it then
like a day later someone found out LG
has files on this device on its server
legitimate official everything pull them
up it's clearly spelled out as a google
play edition g pad 8.3 which is the
first google play edition tablet you
know see ya and then just out of nowhere
less than it's just hours after it less
than 12 hours after this was found
google just it's like they did with the
since five this year in excess for last
year that goes plops up on the website
no big deal about it exempt we get not
only the g pad 8.3 we get a google play
edition xperia z ultra but the new
flavor nexus 7 it's a trifecta now the
white Nexus 7 I have a feeling Taylor's
can tell by because he'd like ordered
one for some reason but let's talk about
the exciting devices first what who
would have guessed that a Z ultra would
be the next Google Play Today okay wait
a second you set exciting devices listen
at 8.3 please yeah Wow literate let's
yeah let's vote I mean hi man Taylor are
obviously a jeep at Camp Stephen you're
the tiebreaker she pad oh you got your
old church sorry its channels no because
you have if the g pad had the xperia
they're not the xperia but the z ultra's
specs then yeah if we could talk about
i'd be super excited but the g pad the
snapdragon 600 cannot man so that's
what's in the g pad that snap snap 600
ship come on yeah it is it good really
solid ship wait what tell her you get
selling into like spec you know spec
traps I don't it so great so it performs
well and the battery life on that tablet
is better than any Snapdragon 600 phone
out there alright so you know the only
reason why you would want to Snapdragon
800 on a tablet is not really necessary
for that salad uh gaming it's just gonna
say yeah that's what I'm that's why I
had prefer the Snapdragon 800 is the kid
played really well man I again my prom
was really having a die not being able
to wake it up again but less so this is
my question guys like I am I I don't
play the most feature and excuse me
resource intensive games but I play like
asphalt 8 and I play a rise of glory air
superiority or whatever and loser you
know fairly taxing and they run great on
a 600 they even run great on the weirdo
computing system in the Moto X so why do
I need an 800 can some1 make the case
for this for me besides the quick
charging thing and the visible and yeah
but it was i don't i don't feel like i'd
lose any visuals playing those games on
Audrina
320 versus 330 exactly right now I
understand that's a big jump but it
doesn't eat I need light reflections and
winds players and I need all that man I
need it so you're saying that side by
side you're making the case that because
I think you're talking at asphalt 8
right uh just just in general like a
kind of have experience in general with
a snapdragon 800 how can you live with
that nexus 7 them I mean well there's a
the reason that i bought the nexus 7 uh
I don't know we if we want to get into
that but we don't okay cool basically
I'm basically replacing my car audio
system with a tablet and the Nexus 7 is
the tablet oh it's perfectly this isn't
the slot I'm sorry we do want to ask
about this so that's this is a project
for mod right yes I'm a pimp it for a
second Taylor if you don't know Taylor
has a nice side project yeah well I was
told not to but if you're doing Brandon
of course does that be but yeah okay so
you can mention it's a podcast you can
mention it it's not okay it's it's my
youtube channel that I started with my
roommate we haven't really done a whole
lot with it because I've been so buried
under devices but um basically it's a
do-it-yourself youtube channel and what
I'll be doing is mounting the nexus 7 in
my carbs dash so be taking out the
double din stereo that came in it and
putting a nexus 7 a wireless charger a
bluetooth module and some custom
fiberglass housing and its place is
rocking that's that's awesome i'm
looking forward to seeing that note you
guys when so that you could use the
white one and then you're going to put
the black one in inter car you soon well
the black one is actually pocket nails
so i don't think that ugh welcome to
prevent all right so wait you're putting
a white one in your car yeah so i don't
understand why you picked the white one
I mean isn't all the white going to be
obscured by whatever casing you install
around it well it's gonna be removable
the way I'm gonna do the mod stickers I
can see it with me but I gonna be like
but just because it it was cool and
because when they announced it they also
did the little $35 Google Play promotion
so I got another chromecast nice all
right all like I was going to buy
another nexus 7 anyway and then it just
kind of happened I'm like I need it now
so
alright well that's the least that's the
least interesting of all three with the
exception of your mod projects a good
luck with that follow taylor on its
Twitter account if you want to see that
develop over time but guys let's talk a
little bit then about the what's missing
from the GPE edition of the g pad
because it's all the LG skin right it's
google play edition so it's just stock
android for dot what yeah or i want to
say so for don't worry yeah so it's
missing all of the stuff that that
afflicts LG built in it's not missing
anything all right let's go sick burn I
actually do today I said google play
edition LG G flex google make it happen
oh my god this was a good talk man I've
had this phone like I really wasn't
excited about the g flex like i don't
know if you guys i'm not a huge fan of
LG and it's not their fault it's just
their products haven't really moved me
and generally i've been in the same boat
i understand yeah and i think most of us
have but this phone it's just there's
something about it i can't put a finger
on it I put it I took it out of the box
on I'm like man this thing is it's nice
like I really like it right I don't know
what but uh okay like I really like that
g 20 can i can i clarify though i like
it if you turn the volume off and leave
it off oh my god and no it's not the
speaker no down stand the speaker is
amazing but the sound effect so LG got
the Vienna Boys Choir to do a bunch of
life's good Oh God and when you when you
wake up I've done this in the pockets
before but you set an alarm Taylor and
you wake up to that phone waking up with
the default ringtone it's the creepiest
thing ever it's it is you know soprano
and alto boys singing good morning to
you and it's just horrible you're gonna
have a bad day areas oh good it's not
just it's not just them that sounds like
the ringtones and everything literally
everything you do on the phone makes a
noise looks like a galaxy s4 in that
respective Boop yeah all Samsung's bad
about it and I always said that Samsung
was the worst about all the noises but I
think LG was like you know what we're
gonna top it sounds like the depiction
of all technology from the future in
movies everything is
back to it oh yeah everything beeps all
the time yeah now so what we're going to
talk a little bit about the g flex I'm
glad that you got a Taylor has one and I
have one now and they both have to go
away at some point but if you missed it
watch our full review and stuff we
talked about that last week this is
actually the first pocket net weekly in
a long time that hasn't had chief flex
in the title so I think we're you know
the new cycle moves on its alright we're
coming I'm not gonna ask you any
questions about it anyway so let's go
great yeah exactly yeah nobody cares
anyway nobody just read the review and
nobody in the pocket i'll live ask me
anything about it last week you know my
problem with that g flex is that price
tag if it weren't so pricey be like oh
why not i love the g two i honestly did
she did try that something i love that
LG does this like they do this thing
where they release a bunch of things
that I'm not into which they did right
before the optimus G and I'm like and
then the optimus G came out I'm like
fine I'll guess I'll review this and it
was really good it was like sweeter and
then the g2 came out and I was like I'm
not really sold on this and then jaime
of course you were but I was like
whatever okay LG likes and I'm like oh
my god is the best thing ever and then
they'll have like five min Rangers and a
new view and will be like it's so weird
roller coaster but uh that you know who
put it best and I wish this had been my
quote but it's not Digital Trends had a
review which LG tweeted and by the way
LJ if you wanted to tweet my review I'd
really love that that'd be great but
Digital Trends had a wonderful review
where there's a quote that was like
going back to a flat phone somehow feels
wrong after using the g flex that's not
an exact quote but it's it's so true i
mean after you've used it for a little
bit you pick up any other phone it like
oh how did we go about using these flat
things for a very long time anyway
that's the g flex conversation we
promised we wouldn't have yeah if you
want to go from one extreme to the other
you go rama from the g flex to the z
ultra i was just going to make thank you
thank you you've redeemed yourself yes
that's exactly the opposite end of the Z
ultra which is now GP edition available
does is anyone if you had to choose
which one would you pick everyone answer
the stock Z ultra or the GPE addition
the gpe sorry hidden when people do that
I'm sorry was none an option no it's not
you saw you hate Iran if you had to get
what if what you're getting one under
under the Christmas tree or at the
Hanukkah bush or I'm in your stocking
wherever google play all day google play
edition what about you Stephen google
play and I'm it I'd be standing at
bestbuy to return it how do you not
allotted this one see I don't understand
I don't I don't know what I would do I I
actually kind of like Saudis skin am I
the only one in the world yep yep yep I
don't hate their skin but it's just when
you compare their skin to Google play's
the google play edition um it's it's a
different beast man this segues into
something that I wanted to ask you
gentlemen about before I wrote an
editorial about it how long do you think
it'll be until we see a native Android
version that can take advantage of
larger screen sizes because right now
you'd really can't you need a third
party skin to do for example multi
window yeah uh oh god I would love to
have multi window in in stock Android
that would be I would be in heaven when
that be amazing Oh happen here why was I
having see I mean the devices are
growing you know yeah I bounds when
Samsung does it the company can get away
with making it only work with their
specific subset of apps they wanted to
if google released us as a baked in
feature it would have to be compatible
with pretty much everything and that's
gonna be so much more work that i can't
see and how is that true I don't let me
go go just say like you need to listen
you can turn this on a raw food that no
well okay look at Samsung they limit
them by default so they limit what apps
work by default there was a simple
simple simple hack that a developer put
together and you can actually get it if
you're rooted you can get it from google
play and it's like multi-window
management or yeah that's we saw back
last year when they came literally yay
all you had to do was it was just a
simple like tweak very simple and every
app worked perfectly with it really
there's no compatibility issues with a
full screen everything full screen no
games are in the world games position
yeah you would want to limit
aims but yeah like what are you gonna do
like play asphalt while you're like
watching a YouTube video that's not the
worst thing Millie yeah but but pretty
much every app works because if you
develop your Android apps correctly they
should be able to work the same on any
screen size and that that includes
something with you know a one to one
aspect ratio or four three or something
to that effect so they're they're meant
to scale and with multi window all
you're doing is basically putting to use
quote views side by side so not view is
not V you know not use because then you
have a kyocera echo so thank you for the
clarification on that we're going to
think more about that in the future as
we as we write our editorial editorial
stiff but ok so I'm the only one who
would get the Z ultra but i would pay a
big premium if i were shopping the
google play edition store for that phone
right now 650 bucks yeah par for the
course you see it what did it make what
the changeover price because think about
it like the g flex its you know gpe g
pad 8.3 which is a mouthful is 350 yes
but you cannot i think i don't think it
says attractive a device as the sony
product and also you can't take it like
in the shower which sounds like I'm
making a stupid joke but I really really
value water resistance in my product I
don't find I like listen this from
coming from a guy that you that sweats
like a pig and runs with his phones I
would love a waterproof phone but it is
just the most uncomfortable and
cumbersome size and form factor that
I've ever seen have you no no have you
if you actually like used one for a bit
yeah yeah I kind of its I kind of did
but I how can I explains the one of my
friends brought it with him so I I
didn't really use it for a week or
tested for a week I just held it tight
around with it and I was like oh my god
how can you put up with the thing this
big it's like you know if it were
rounded somewhat you know it could
probably be a little more comfortable to
use but I I don't know I hey listen I
love
then in light though to you know it yes
but it's like one max or of 15 it's like
putting a clipboard in your pocket man
both it's not pocket-friendly I Oh
doesn't it have that little loop on the
bottom so you can look like I could get
up to it because my ankle after like a
wallet from your wristband oh yes you
can be Flavor Flav with a Z ultra that
so a neck lanyard yeah so in this phone
this phone reminds me of the optimist
view that's what it reminds me of you
know it's just one of those awkward
things that they can do and they did but
that doesn't have a market yeah I don't
think don't get me wrong i don't think
the market it has is very big at all but
don't say that i said that in the review
and i got reamed know but you know that
this is why i was happy to do that
review rebuttal because i was like you
know what if i were in the market for a
device of this class and by that i mean
a 6 plus inch screen size or near six
inch screens has like the the one max
the 1520 the mega 6.3 and this thing
does the ultra if i were in the market
for a device that big that i wanted to
use as a tablet replacement i would get
the z ultra because it's the thinnest
and i don't know if it's the lightest
but it's definitely the thinnest of the
bunch and you know as a result that's
the least cumbersome for me and is Rin
in addition you get beautiful build
quality and and waterproof no I'm with
you there but I just think that for a
lot of people the size is a non-starter
any other dimensions no that's listen it
is that's that Koreans had to get that
other way right up front like you have
to be shopping for this type of the
right by how I disagree it's gonna be
the most popular thing ever because
everybody loves putting clipboards in
their pockets whatever Riggins exactly
exactly listen I mean the galaxy note 3
has killed phablets everywhere and it's
just gonna be that way for that price
tag why not just get a note 3 and get
something that you can actually still
fit in your pocket that's got the best
processor the best battery life the best
everything and just you know deal with
TouchWiz which is the only sad part
about that phone this is gone I guess
with the Z ultra or any other phablet
this is not in the rundown but speaking
of the galaxy note and how it compares I
just posted a comparison between the G
the G flex and the galaxy note 3 so if
you're interested in how those devices
compared go watch that because that was
a
fun comparison because Jaime you spoke
directly to your point it's like anytime
we bring a phone up against the note 3
the other phone basically losses right
yeah it doesn't have as solid a phablet
experience the g flex it probably has
come the closest and it's not because
I'm an idiot fanboy it's it's because it
really does get quite close to offering
everything the note 3 does with the
exception of the s-pen so and it focuses
more on user experience and and form
factor yeah then than just hey this is
giant exactly and that's something that
I had to test like a giant foam for the
sake of being giant also nobody wants to
watch your comparison Michael because it
could it includes the g flex and just
just just saying yeah speaking of the g
flex brandon was just bugging me to sell
my chief leg i just got it like just now
we got an email he's like hey weren't
you supposed to sell that thing and like
oh god so you know hey check check swap
afore for a slightly tear-stained g flex
soon you didn't want to you're stayin
yeah I'm all comprised gonna cry all
over it well you didn't want to prod NCP
give it to you for Christmas that's what
I want to do but I don't have I don't
have the courage maybe maybe our
listeners can write and can start a
letter-writing campaign good deer vs
home addresses michael fisher wants this
so anyways let's be honest they're gonna
spell his name mmm-mmm-mmm brandon min
min min min min amendment oh sad news
brandon 10 CES this year sorry so yeah
Frau now does that mean that ticket
available banjos hoping we still really
like a four-man team but we don't I
don't think we're doing that so yeah
anti until that was gonna have you knew
that was gonna happen hired new though I
knew that was gonna happen that was too
good to be true it was you know it would
have been an all-star team now it's a
now it's a 75-percent our team that's a
three-wheeled wagon I what are we gonna
do I wish you were gonna be there my man
my dream oh yeah I'm just gonna have I'm
gonna have to swap that for bus along
I'm sorry about that
right hey so listen let's talk about
another phone can we move on let's talk
about the Moto G Taylor just posted his
review I just got mine in the mail I
actually woke up the first thing I woke
up to today was my door buzzer I'm
telling me the FedEx man was here and I
got a moto G so we both have moto g's
let's let's let's let's hear better
to either sleep way too later you have
an awesome FedEx guy no man now they
show up at like 730 like a man we got
stuff and got stuff for you and speaking
about that fits speak about that fax
just called me the ziti knew we had just
arrived I have to go pick it up soon
chocolate Oh awesome good stuff good
stead so this this moto G I gave it a
seven point seven out of ten I don't
want to spoil the review but I that's
that's a score i gave it and I feel like
it's a pretty fair score because it is a
very cheap device and its specifications
and everything else that you know motor
all I had to cut corners to make this
phone they only spent 125 dollars or
something to make it is that what it was
yeah what they said yeah that that's
just for the hardware component so
that's not including you know cost of
manufacturing labor marketing and all
this other stuff that's just the actual
price of the hardware and if i'm not
mistaken after you if you add everything
up and the 500 million that google spent
on marketing you know motorola or google
as a whole is taking a loss on this
phone no no there's a way don't we have
that moto x 10 bucks is what the st yeah
sorry the the 500 mil was a further for
the Moto X sorry that was actually in
the beginning of my review I'm like
crossing wires here but uh yeah so ten
dollars the after everything I still
think they're probably you know taking a
hit at some point some way you know ten
dollars is not a lot of margin but uh
for for them to turn out a phone that at
least I feel deserves a 7.7 I think
that's a good thing but in the comments
I'm getting you know blasted again
because we were like it deserves a 10
out of 10 or more than a seven there's
always going to be those jerks a matter
squirt well I want to let us trace not
talk about the score but go ahead said
it say your piece and then let's move
I really don't want to spend any time on
scoring bullsh no one yet I got a damn
it uh all right yeah I now go ahead go
ahead do it yeah yeah I mean okay so
here's the thing we don't include price
and how we make our scores I think what
you tell me if I'm wrong but I think
what you mean to say is that scoring is
is a much much more imprecisely taking a
blend of this court for me with the
three principal scored scoring card yeah
sure but just because the phone is 200
bucks and it's not terrible doesn't mean
it's an automatic 10 out of 10 or 9 out
of 10 or any of that it's a lot more
complicated than that and I feel
completely just with seven point seven
out of 10 for this to I agree with your
score what did we give the HTC first if
anyone remembers cuz that's I'm the same
level of this I reviewed it actually and
I don't remember HTC first review pocket
not better or worse than the Moto G
would you say it yeah what would you say
Taylor and then I'll tell you what you
said I don't know i'm gonna look it up
the HTC first scored an 8 out of 10 oh
yeah and that didn't have the benefit of
price I'm not nearly so much not as much
listen I think that in the case of the
of this moto g I think it's a disruptive
phone but you can't we can't review a
phone and tell people it's an awesome
device when it you know it really isn't
i mean if it's if a price tag is a
factor that's important and it is for a
lot of people than great this is one of
the best phones depict if the budget is
a thing but it's you can't give it a 10
out of 10 and compared to a galaxy note
3 for example you just can't this entire
this entire scoring just gets like this
this tiny talk we have had and i'm
putting it in past tense for a reason is
indicative of how messed up scores are
in general they do not age gracefully
they change over time we don't change
them over time because it would be a
massive amount of work this is why when
you come to a review and you read the
score and then you skip the entire
review go to the comments and start
arguing about the score you do yourself
a disservice because you're not actually
getting the messaging we're supposed to
be putting out there but we cannot do it
at this time
what the hell is that sorry buddy are
you are you is there did you move next
to like a damn what was that I'm a side
business is a cement mixer manufacturing
plant no the truck sorry about that
alright so this is it let's not talk if
you're riding in the bed of this truck
yeah okay okay Taylor so the question is
for example I want to for example I want
to buy my father and my mother a
Christmas gift I really want to buy them
a moto G I mean you think it's a it's a
from your review and from everything
after putting it together I mean I'm
really excited i think this is like a
really compelling gift you know not for
me because it's too little for me but
it's really something that i would love
to give somebody at that price tag it's
crazy not to yeah i'm sad to have to
send it back I mean I probably wouldn't
use it but it it's a great phone like
honestly it'd be something that I would
say you should use when you're working
out because hey if it gets water damage
while you're working out because you're
sweating too much oh well it was a 200
other phone it's not like you're missing
you know losing a 600 other phone you
know that's a question that can I jump
in with a question real quick Taylor I
didn't catch this in your review but are
the boards coated with motorola's nano
coating and this font and this one you
know um I heard somewhere it was but I
didn't know it before the review okay
I'll take on that and sorry keep making
your point yeah I'm just saying like
it's one of those phones that you kind
of feel like you know you think it's are
damaged or destroyed you know whatever
move on because it was 200 bucks no
contract um it's one of those good like
if you break your phone you know this is
something you can fall back on its a
good you know budget phone that you can
toss around and not worry about like if
I go climbing I like to go climbing if I
go climbing this is something I'd pop my
sim in and take with me because every
time I've gone climbing I've scratched
and damaged one of my other phones yeah
I think I think this phone is more
disruptive than a lot of people are
thinking that it is I mean right now you
can go buy a galaxy ace or galaxy duos
for like three hundred and something
dollars and these are H
da displays with terrible processors
terrible performance and now you've got
the Moto G for two hundred dollars and
it's got very little to envy from most
if not all mid-tier phones actually even
some high-end phones from early this
year so editorial about as much as this
the only way that it's going to avoid
disrupting the market is if somehow
other manufacturers prevent it from
being available as widely as we would
like it to be yeah yeah great and so to
answer my own question yes it does have
the nano coating and someone some brave
soul made a six-minute youtube video
dropping it in a sink full of water and
then like drying it out it works fine
it's a wait a second so he didn't do the
shower rubber ducky video that somebody
did it I feel it works her pocket now
yeah we have a copyright on that on that
particular yeah yeah yeah so I over
little area cement I read all of
motorola's promotional stuff and
everything and I apparently overlooked
that but uh well maybe there's somebody
pointed out how damn it is there yeah so
that's that's great that's just another
example of like wow this is what you get
for 179 bucks and that's pretty red I've
used them about you all day I'm about to
write a review on it right after the pod
crews me not a review an editorial on it
right after the podcast because it has
floored me not necessarily that like
okay Taylor you made some great points
the camera stinks the speaker is not
that great there are compromises that
this budget phone has made but none of
the compromises in my experience have
prevented me from doing literally
anything that I would do with one of my
daily drivers like the Moto X and I'm
talking about the deal like not the
accessories not like active display and
stuff but the pylons that make up my
daily smartphone experience I've been
using it all day and I'm like wow I
could actually carry this I wouldn't
because I value other things but if i
needed to i could buy this in a pinch
and it would do me fine did you guys any
blocks like the mighty tasking yeah and
and that's well i'm sorry steven are you
asking about multitasking second yeah i
got the impression from calendar
experience with it that the one thing it
really didn't do well was multitasking
Oh limited Ram yeah the only reason is
because every after you you know flip
between two apps every other app is
going to have to completely reload it's
very aggressive and how it manages your
RAM because it only has one gig and we
can't have I guess been spoiled with two
or three gigabytes of RAM so when you
switch apps yeah and they're closing a
lot more quickly than yours too early so
that I'm used to yeah I had like an
Amazon Kindle card that was maybe five
or six cards old and I just went back to
it had to reload the book and my place
in it so yeah I see what you're talking
about there yeah but throughout my
entire review I'd probably a third of it
or maybe you know half of it as Steven
will probably tell you is referencing
the Moto X and I didn't want to do that
when i started writing the review i
didn't want to make you know every i
didn't want to make it a moto x
comparison because that's not what it
was but in a sense it is because
motorola managed to capture most of what
makes the Moto X so great without you
know this giant price tag so you know
it's a great phone and it's almost as
great as the Moto X but it's you know a
third of the price it's interesting we
were talking a little earlier about the
cost to manufacture this and I was
thinking well what would it actually
take to bring the Moto G up to moto X
level specs you know pay a little more
for the more powerful SOC add that extra
gig of ram and by pulled up some
estimates here apparently the Moto X
really does cost quite a bit more to
make the Bill of material is estimated
at two hundred and nine dollars compared
to to the hundred twenty something we
were talking about and remember the Moto
G is not manufactured in the US well the
Moto X's creators just assembled well
well that's that 2009 figure is not
including manufacturing costs yeah uh
well see i think motorola would do
themselves a favor if they sold the moto
x at 350 to begin with yeah yeah yeah so
this one thing we were talking about was
you know they're not going to make a lot
of profit off this moto g but that's not
the point they're gonna fill the
emerging markets with a high end it not
high-end a mid-range android foam that
you know blows everything else away and
they're gonna do it without you know
making a lot of money but they're gonna
get that that market share and kind of
reestablish the brand that's kind of
been lost now that's not my question my
question in that vein is how will it do
against the similarly cheap Lumia 520
because I was having a conversation with
Brandon and Anton earlier where I was
like listen we need to do a comparison
about this like right now and I'm very
interested in how this pans out because
the Lumia 520 right now do you guys can
someone tell me how much it is at the
microsoft store right now I know it was
it was fifty dollars it was fifty
dollars during the day sale and now do
you know how much it's gone up since
black friday go ahead it's only it's
it's gone up by 20 bucks it's fifty nine
dollars for a Lumia 520 right now and so
we usually work in my head over what
I've been able to do with the Moto G all
day I can't think of something that I
did on the Moto G that I'm not gonna be
able to do on the 520 so the problem
with the Lumia 520 is that because of
the RAM limitation remember that Windows
Phone actually there are certain things
and specifically in nokia applications
that are very limited on that phone I
you know I thought that things were
supposed to be great but then when I was
putting together Adams review i started
learning that yet there are a lot of
limitations to the phone so it's not
like in the case of the Moto G where you
can get the full android experience
without compromise on the Moto G you
won't get that same experience on the
520 seen this with the 525 is supposed
to address well that's what the five
guys one of the five of the ramp I've
exactly that's what the 525 addresses
but in the case of the 520 it is not the
same thing so yeah I mean it's it's it's
a bowl it's a I mean it's a fifty-dollar
phone I mean it's like yeah why would I
spend i spent fifty dollars last night
and beer I mean you party animal yes the
dollar phone that is like crazy i could
use that I don't know for I can give it
to my dog I mean come on use that give
your dollars to my dog every Thursday
just to show him I love him here all
right so listen we gotta move on guys
we're we're
behind on time even more than usual
because I run down is so long so let's
is you Taylor do you have any final
thoughts on the Moto G other than just
directing people to your review no not
not aside from the fact that i would
recommend this to a lot of people a lot
of people who are looking for a phone
you know someone who's a first time
buyer people looking for a first-time
phone for their you know their teenager
grandparents it's just that that foam
that kind of fits the bill for a lot of
different people people who don't have a
lot of needs with their smartphone but
even those who do this still works it's
just not going to you know really appeal
to us the power users so there's that no
there is that I love it what's next on
the rundown guys I'm having a discussion
on the side here they oh yeah Stephen
just read this headline verbatim please
LG g2 mini could be the largest
quote-unquote mini phone yet I love
singing HTC was the manufacturer we made
fun of last for building a mini phone
that really wasn't all that many and now
it looks like that this one if it's real
might be an even bigger offender yeah
well if we look at many just as screen
size LG did some great things with the
g2 with the bezel so even if this so
what we're talking about is I think a
4.7 inch er which is not mini by any
phone would seem released to date but it
could be physically smaller than devices
like the HTC One just by you know
optimizing the the face of the screen so
its most or face of the phone so it's
mostly the screen sure because motorola
did the same thing with the Moto X I
know we just got done talking about moto
but you know that does still doesn't
feel like a 4.7 inch screen no it's
about the same size as the iphone right
yeah which is crazy so and it's jaime
makes a good point in that apparently we
skipped something what are you talking
about I don't know we we didn't but
let's go ahead go ahead continue oh I
see what you're saying yeah yeah yeah
yeah sorry so anyway the the g2 mini I
feel like first of all you can make a
phone much smaller than the HTC One with
little or no effort because you don't
have to bundle in the boomsound speakers
right because the one is one of the
bigger 4.7 inch slices
there but it is there a not many miles
do ya still not many my point in
bringing this into the rundown was to
ask the question has any manufacturer
really seen a lot of success selling
mini versions of its phones I can't
imagine they have no no way and so yeah
they do it because the the capability is
there they can manufacture them and it
will service a small niche of people who
would otherwise go elsewhere because if
that you know if we don't do it somebody
else is going to do a mini phone so I
was just in the sprint store the other
day I saw a galaxy s4 mini for the first
time maybe not for the first time if the
first time I was paying attention did
you point and laugh no I actually lil I
liked it and it I understood why Samsung
did it because if I were the type of
person which I was at one point to go
into storm be like listen big phones are
freaking lame man I don't want to carry
a shoe in my pocket like just give me
something with a manageable palm size mm
um the s4 you know if I was like a
normal person the s4 would have caught
my eye for a little bit actually so yeah
but ever every time that I see a friend
of mine with an s3 mini for example I
feel sorry for them you know cuz for
example here the price difference
between the s3 mini and the s3 back then
wasn't really significant and you know
you don't get any software updates you
don't get anything it's like that what I
hate about the whole mini mentality is
that they are really giving very minimal
support to that phone yeah yeah yeah
sorry the moped just I don't know why
that was funny of it that was funny
everyone's getting distracted by
vehicles today yeah no it's a good point
though I think what you were saying
about the store is probably you're right
on point here I don't think anyone
actually goes out looking for one of
these mini versions of flagships but you
stumble across them when you're looking
for something else and it can seem like
you know maybe a like a good idea
they're gonna settle but you know you
want something smaller and it's the best
thing available and the trick that is
built into the branding works it's like
here's the flagship name to catch your
eye here a mini right after it oh so
it's probably the same thing in a
smaller footprint of course we've had
the discussion why that's not the case
but my question is does the
LG g2 have enough credit this point to
where they can expect to sell a lot of
versions of the mini because they
haven't sold many g2 no but did we hear
about that figure like two and a half
million maybe three what was it was
something like that I think we talked
about it last week so that's you know
concerning and meanwhile the other half
of the company are not other half but
another division within the company
another portion of the same division
within the company is making a product
like the g flex which is kind of I don't
have blown me away maybe that's maybe
I'm alone in that but it just strikes me
as odd that they would dedicate any
resources to making a mini version of a
phone that um is a fine fighter there
wasn't really yeah is really selling it
they called it anything else we wouldn't
be having its discussion it was just the
LG G something the LG G small yeah like
7h phone with these specs I think it'd
be we wouldn't worry about what it was
called it's a yeah the point to have in
their lineup right so maybe that's a
good points even maybe the discussion
went like listen we're gonna build a
phone in the mid-range line anyway if we
call it what do they call their mid
wrench is the better mid-range the
wealthy capable ones are the absolute
asked series yeah so if we call it an F
Series not a lot of people are gonna get
excited if we're gonna build this anyway
why don't we just call it a g2 mini and
see if that see what that does to sales
I I understand I respect that I mean we
behind me we play with YouTube titles
all the time to see what gets more
attention yeah I don't want to do a
review on this thing 40 million reviews
have already come out all right two
videos one list of hates one list of
loves done you know what I do well I get
sidetracked when people talk about mini
phones that's what I do I think we I
think we all might be guilty of that
actually just read a hilarious headline
you've all heard about the interpreter
from nelson mandela's memorial yeah they
just said yeah it's get siffredi a coma
yeah first he claimed that he had asked
is schizophrenic episode then he claimed
that he was actually signing but he was
using a different dialect in sign
language and then are now interpreter at
mandela memorial says he saw angels
headlines all right have you watched the
video of it no known areas we're if we
if we were ahead of schedule like we
usually are we could talk or that up
over now let's move on Jaime makes a
good point about the next one we're not
going to talk about the next story
because it's no longer a story that was
the nexus 8 discussion and michael is
just too stupid to know that yeah same
you hurt my feelings just then something
is telling headline it caught your eye
see thank you galaxy s4 active one of my
favorite phones from Samsung ever for
real is joining the Snapdragon 800 club
isn't it right Steven yeah yeah it's the
latest samsung phone to get the LTE
advanced upgrade so we're going to be
seeing a new warm not way but people in
South Korea will be seeing a new version
of Aegeus were active 30cm lovely really
really awesome i hope that that upgrade
comes to the states even if it's not
with a lot of bombast if they just kind
of replace the existing stock with it
this is a good opportunity to mention i
was earlier this week we saw that sprint
announced a new version of its own
galaxy s4 to take advantage of its own
network upgrade for the sprint spark LTE
arctic it's not lte-advanced and i was
curious if this actually was going to be
a new version with an 800 because that's
been the modus operandi for samsung gear
comes out with a new galaxy model to
work with better LTE against the 800 I
can confirm that's not happening sadly
the new sprint gs4 will keep on running
the old 600 well that's okay because as
we said earlier in the show the 600 is
still pretty good yeah we like the six
but it would have been nice to see the
analyst at your point I wonder though
that it wasn't in his point but my point
is your point your points are
substantially inferior on a usual oasis
yeah I guess want to see your key is for
active with an AMOLED in it I was just
going to say that I that is what I would
love to see the LCD does well but an
AMOLED in a gs4 active would be great
however they don't leave us totally out
in the cold because they're also
swapping out the camera module alright
that last year's 8 megapixel unit we're
getting 13 megapixel sensor in the
galaxy s4 active and when I say we I'm a
good point we don't
and we we mean the South Koreans
congratulate yes if we're good maybe
every time I save if wee-bey what what
happen every time I see that I'm like
Oliver China only for Taiwan only felt
like ah whatever you know it's funny
like we it's I haven't heard that very
often recently like I think we've been
spoiled for a long time and now some
phones are coming out for Regions not
including our I was really upset today
there was a Sony contest where if they
have a really nice NFC commercial
showing off all their NFC accessories
and they made a Christmas tree that's
NFC controlled like this is awesome you
can enter to win it comes with a bunch
of NFC tags a NFC bluetooth speaker it's
only for the UK 00 i feel that pain well
you enjoy that UK folks serious great uh
and NFC Christmas tree just what I
wanted that's everybody's what I won't
need it really speaking of the UK we're
gonna do a little on the fly switcheroo
in the rundown and just touch very
briefly on HTC's well good news for HTC
today HTC has been in a legal battle
well as many people are with with Nokia
for a very long time and this has
resulted in some component changes
within the HTC one between the early and
late flights which we talked about in
listener mail last week yada yada yada
the point is the case is continuing and
HTC has managed to find itself a bit of
luck as stephen shank says and the court
has issued a stay on the one mini
injunction because what had happened was
that there was an injunction issued and
one minis could no longer be sold in the
UK so this is just a temporary thing HTC
is not totally off the hook but for the
moment the sales of its hardware can
continue so if you if all you want for
Christmas or the holidays is an HTC one
mini in you live in the UK then you no
longer have to worry problem solved yeah
good for you sorry it does stuff like
five times what well that's good Taylor
you woke up just in time to tell us all
about how Google is or is not killing
off the gallery this is like huge news
to me
I think this was the first thing I I
read when I woke up the other day I
don't I don't know what to make of this
I just started using google's new photo
editor today Taylor maybe you're the not
the best person that tell us about this
do you know anything about it or should
I ask Stephen the news chief to tell us
well he can explain it I can give my
take because I think that's the best I
would like Lana back that's a wonderful
compromise and while you guys do it I'm
going to continue being ignorant about
this piece of news as I grab a glass of
water I'll be right back Stephen begin
Oh Ethel calendar was going first ok no
no exactly sure what's happening though
so we saw these the new the google play
editions of the the g pad and the tablet
z from sony and tablet Z Xperia Z
whatever it is and when we actually got
to see the softer on these it turned out
that unlike the nexus 5 which came with
the old gallery app though familiar with
on stock Android to look at all your
pictures nexus 5 came with both that and
this new photo app which is google plus
baked in very similar but different in
some notable ways and unlike the nexus 5
these two new models have just the photo
app no more old gallery so you're they
forced your hand into you don't have to
use google+ to use the app but it's a
part of it it's always there and it's i
think it's going to be the way that we
see you know future nexus devices coming
out yeah i agree there and there's been
a lot of people who are upset over this
mainly because it does force you to use
Google+ but I frankly love it it doesn't
force you to you can get away without it
you can get away google has shamelessly
looked for ways to make you use Google+
so much that they can't figure it out
anymore i Taylor how can you live in
Google+ seriously I love it and there
are a lot of people who do so people who
say that Google+ is barren wasteland of
tumbleweeds and anywhere fans are kind
of out of loop there are a lot of people
who use it and there it's it's one of
the largest social platforms I have no
much they all for Google+ itself it's
just
not having an option to ignore it while
wanting to still be a committed Android
user is becoming a larger and larger
thing but it's kind of the whole
experience I mean you don't have to use
google plus um you have to sign up for
it but you know there are a lot of
friends I have that signed up for it and
have never posted anything you don't
have that sign up where I had google
account that still has not had Google+
activated on it yeah but it throws it in
your face every time something like when
you activate a phone and ask you like
six nights to donut don't remind me
about that i mean my pocket now account
is yeah I never wanted to open that
Google+ and it opened it and and now
everybody's following me to that account
and I never use it dude I'm in the same
but I thought it was the only one
everyone follows me at the wrong account
because I can't shut down in the wrong
account and use the right one I hate you
know it's not just Google Plus who you
can't have not managed multiple like it
provides the worst experience people
have multiple Google accounts it's
horrible yes yeah but you can't shut
down the old account because I had to
but that aside the new photos out there
are a lot of people who say they don't
like it because the photo editing is
worse or yeah it's less functional but I
think this is just a step along the way
they're taking a step back to kind of
regroup and they're probably and I don't
know for sure but I think they're
somehow going to integrate snapseed with
this because that's what they did with
with Google+ itself and with the old
gallery so it's it's really a non-issue
if you're complaining about what it can
do from within the Photos app versus
what it could do with in gallery because
I'm a person who probably takes as many
pictures as anybody else I mean probably
more yeah I'll take picture and I want
to get actors Taylor your pictures are
good and I good that was a dive dinner
jacket I'm sorry we have to let home I
go right now so he can go get that phone
so sorry it's hard to disrupt your flow
boys but hi my thank you for joining us
go get that new ba5 brother seriously
seriously um so yeah anyways i sorry I
have to go I sadly things here close at
5pm I hate this country and that's but
and they don't leave at 5pm they always
leave at four forty-five Mosley
no seriously you may be the first person
anywhere to rush off to get a ZTE phone
so congratulations oh thank you well the
problem is if I leave it there overnight
it probably won't wake up there so
that's really the reason I you know
every we've recently demonstrated that's
yeah the 20 that's we're not immune to
that problem here in the States
apparently so go get it I may we will
hear from you on the on that device soon
and enjoy it it's that Houston Rockets
branded one so you have a sort of a
really special device there so have fun
what are the Houston Rockets apparently
there's a kind of bowling team yeah by
now alright guys take care I don't see
you later i may say listeners if you
want to know where to reach high may you
should listen to the end of the show
guys can we wrap up talking about
pictures real quick you make your last
player Taylor yeah all I was going to
say is that if I need to edit a picture
that I've taken mmm 10 times out of ten
I'm either going to use photoshop or
Snapseed I never use the built-in one
because it's just a functional period
like the bill t I use it all the time
yeah I never did hmm Snapseed though is
a great app and people it's not as good
as fo tour which is like the best app
ever but you got to be on Windows fun to
use that I think I don't like that one
Oh photo are so great it's terrible no i
did a video on Windows Phone editors and
it's awful you're you're wrong you're
wrong tell her when you said use
Photoshop do me on your phone or on the
pc photoshop touch yes okay nice mmm rad
the last story in android sorry guys
were going to move on was spotify
related and i was going to have high
might talk about it unfortunately he is
no longer around to talk about that or
his iOS video so sad face on that so I'm
actually just going to dump the iOS
category completely you should watch
Jaime's video ipad air what we love and
hate and users in the United States who
use Spotify should you know notice the
fact that Spotify is rethought its
business model and has confirmed that
its new mobile experience is free so you
can listen to playlists search for
artists and listen to all the music you
would like without having to pay for
spotify premium and the experience on a
tablet is largely unencumbered stephen
shank reports but what's the catch
Steven well the tablet there's not so
much of a catch you can search
artist you can find the song can listen
to what you want to more or less the
catches for the smartphone where yeah
you can search for songs you can search
for artists and pull up the playlist to
spot by Spotify gives you but you can't
exactly choose where you want to listen
to within net flavor so with the only
way to play music is in a permanent
state of shovel so you know the song
you're looking for is in that playlist
but you're going to have to keep hidden
skip to get to it I think new limited to
like six an hour or something like that
so Oh God ideal but but get me table
yeah i mean it's it's a great option
where no option existed before so that's
awesome did it though cuz i was confused
about this i always had spotify on my
phone and we just listened to the
pre-built radio stations for artists and
that was always free oh I'd actually
didn't know that yeah least this now you
can I guess search for individual songs
is the benefit which is a huge benefit
and it's like the principal benefit of
Spotify so uh Wow well if you live in a
market where Spotify supported check
that out if you don't sorry that's so
that's unfortunate so shall we gentlemen
move on to windows what do you think no
mmm they had his chance oh man I would
say I wish hi mate was still here but he
would just make it worse all right I'll
be the lone contender for ya tell us
about the other 15 20 yes so jumping
into Windows the Nokia Lumia 1520 review
is up and it's it was a bit late but
it's up now other videos been up for
weeks but now it's linked and embedded
and everything looks good um if you like
shaft jokes you should read the review
but as we talked earlier in the show as
we discussed earlier round triche after
ya know like I think samuel l jackson
shaft cuz like yeah you know right yeah
it's like okay i can go watch that but i
wouldn't really want to be my first
choice that's how i feel about the 1520
personally just because as we discussed
earlier in the show the size when you
build a device this big you have to make
it as comfortable as possible and while
the 1520 is not uncomfortable it is kind
of unapologetically massive in the same
that the one max is but in a net saree
in a very different way than the one max
is but they are equally uncomfortable in
certain situations like I've been using
the 1520 to read in bed the past few
nights and it's just like oh my god
balancing it unless you are exactly like
properly vertical is impossible so if
you're lying on your side trying to read
in bed it's like this thing is just huge
and big go that's it vertical I pictured
you hanging on the wall in a sleeping
bag like astronauts Lee yeah yeah that's
better for your back really right yeah
if I'm dangling upside down with my
wings folded over my chest then it works
nicely but it's it's just a big heavy
device um which is wonderful i think i
summed it up in the bottom I was like
the screen is beautiful the the
experience when you're watching movies
when you're reading a book when you're
doing stuff that that is taking up all
of your attention is great and I kind of
called it a monster but a friendly
lovable one it's it's Windows Phone
needed to get into the phablet game
nokia needed to get into the phablet
game and they did it fairly well here i
like how the home screen uses the space
efficiently up front i can kind of
glance and see everything i need to see
but unfortunately there's no like
advanced multitasking options unless you
go for a third-party solution which was
linked to me by a generous commenter and
i was like oh let me go check this out a
third-party up let's let's multi-window
happen on windows phones and I kind of
looked at the screenshots and was like
oh oh no no I can't I can't Brook this
good at home screen just makes my head
hurt it's just too many I too much going
on yeah I like it see I like it too i
I've it's it's so refreshing to me not
to have to scroll down to see any more
like it's all right there I'd for the
I've said this before but for the first
time since 2010 Microsoft's like
promised to deliver a glanceable UI has
been fulfilled it's like it's all right
here yeah well glanceable or something
you have to scan with your eyes I don't
know cuz I like you may have to because
you haven't used it but I've used it for
about two weeks and I know mean you ever
use the foam you haven't used my
configuration right you know where to
look exactly right my eyeball knows
where to go when I want to know what
I go right to the middle you know when I
went news is right below that calendar
is right to the left like I know you
know I know where stuff is I think this
interface could be made better by the
allowance to color code your own tiles
because I don't know about you guys but
my brain instantly seeks out color first
and when I'm trying to find something in
a hurry and to be able to like make the
phone tile green for example would be a
big help to me that's interesting i was
just reading through some design
documents for us doing an editorial on
the notification bar that some of you
may have seen an android and google says
specifically don't use anything in your
notifications that uses color to
identify your app we don't want you
doing that interesting well you know
that's I see why they would do that
because for a while Android was kind of
like a no-holds-barred like no rules
land cowboy landscape and like there
were all kinds of colors everywhere and
none of it made any sense so they really
had to clamp down on that yes I think
they've gone a little far with the
latest version of Android though because
like the complete removal of all those
blue highlights from the status bar has
just made it look really boring to me
like when my Moto X got the updated i
miss the blue for for data kind that's
another design decision they made any
icons went up there have to be white for
the transparent bar yeah like you know
I'm not digging on that too much but
well let's just say that you can go read
the 15 20 review if you want to go read
it it's linked right there it's awesome
i'd love it if you read it i spent a
long time on it and there are great
things about the device i painted a
really crappy picture of it just now but
there it does a lot of things really
well let's talk about these Windows
Phone rumors i'm going to change it up
again because we started talking you I
Stephen what is going on with this rumor
is it at all feasible that any of this
is true or total different rumors here
in the rundown which are you talking
about the UI one this this this crazy
rumor that hog and in 2014 windows phone
is somehow gonna lose the Metro
aesthetic yeah what we could tell us
what the hell this is okay I don't
believe a word of it yeah so eldar
Mertes een who some of you may be
familiar with has been a really prolific
a tipster guy he has his sources
he makes all these predictions and he's
kind of hitting this a while back he was
known for generally beating on point but
let me make the point here before you
know it to that I'm not I don't mean to
throw him under the bus as a tipster I'm
actually not really familiar with him so
I can't say one way or the other way I
just mean this rumor sounds so
outlandish we don't know whether he's
trying to mislead at now here's he heard
this he's passing it on and so the
couple components to it basically he's
talking about next big iteration of
Windows Phone Windows Phone 9 or
whatever it's called coming out sometime
in the second half of next year which is
way sooner than we've been hearing about
we were still looking forward to 8.1
just launching in the spring sometime
and you know more than just coming out
then he says it's going to integrate RT
which we also thought was a lot farther
out and it could completely ditch the
you know the Metro UI no more live tiles
and that's just it's crazy DOM Microsoft
just spent years putting hands on
everything I can see how this is going
around now because there's been a lot of
talk about on the desktop them going
back to the start menu and am returning
to the traditional desktop look because
users have really been rejecting the
Metro look there I think it's working on
the smartphone side I can't see them a
switching course so drastically yeah I
mean it is i think a windows phone is
easily the most readily identifiable
divide mobile device out there in terms
of the platform like when you look at a
blackberry screen is kind of like okay
well there's big tiles i kind of don't
know what that is web a lesson well no I
know oh yeah yeah exactly well like
you're looking at an iOS 7 device and
you look at an Android device and yes we
can all tell the differences but I don't
know that a lot of consumers would
instantly be able to remove the benefit
of hardware if you can pass one off as a
heavily skinned version of the other
vice for exactly right whereas actually
have athenaeum actually have a theme on
my Nexus 5 that I applied in for a video
i just posted where my Nexus 5 actually
looks just like iOS 7 so yeah but
whereas windows phone looks nothing like
that and when you try to make Windows
Phone look like another OS like it fails
visibly yeah uh well that there's that's
a double-edged sword and I think we've
talked about this before where a lot of
people have had terrible terrible
experiences on windows 8 and that's kind
of trickling down into the mobile
systems where they're not really wanting
to try windows phone because their home
pc is something that just makes them
angry when they turn it on which is
which is funny because we did talk about
this like over a year ago on this
podcast I was the one saying like hey
listen guys we got windows 8 coming soon
if it's a hit it is going to naturally
inject some life into windows phone
sales and I'm not willing to say it's
not a hit I in terms of sales numbers
and stuff i really don't know I but it
certainly offers its way down what's
that historically if you compare
adoption based on when windows 8 release
compared to when windows 7 was released
and look at over time windows 7 has been
selling at like twice the rate as
Windows 8 really yeah yeah I think
there's definitely been some stigma
attached to two windows 8 in a variety
of areas but I don't really want to get
into that because I'm frankly not
informed enough to do it I know that I
feel much less passionate about Windows
8 then I do windows phone 8 and I don't
think that's really news to anybody out
there do you guys feel the same or no ah
i can't i have trouble getting excited
over anything windows phone 8 and that's
not because i dislike windows only it's
just not exciting for me it's just
something it's a valid option it's
decent at what it does but for me it
just doesn't it doesn't really think
really diverse windows 8 though I mean
like which I haven't really spent a lot
of time with windows 8 I yeah see I I
try to I go back and Stephen you answer
the question then i'll talk about that i
have larger philosophical issues with
windows 8 than I do with Windows Phone 8
and specifically if there's one thing I
like about Windows Phone 8 it's that
Metro will look to it that completely
nailed it for me me too I agree and
every time i go back to try and use
windows 8 for a specific purpose or
because there's been an update and i
want to try it out I'm like ah it's
almost as the as if for the way I use
things windows 8 brings all of the
things I don't like about Windows Phone
8 and makes them bigger and it
eliminates all the good things I like
about Windows Phone 8 I don't know but
in any case uh I probably isn't going to
happen I think this particular is total
crap yeah I I don't see them ditching
the tile-based you I and I don't see
Artie I'm on the fence about whether RT
is going to disappear or is going to get
rebranded as I believe it something yeah
it's going to merge into something else
but I've gotta trust in Mary Jo Foley is
you know incredibly reliable and she was
talking about that's transition coming
after the rumor threshold series of
upgrades which itself wouldn't be until
sometime in 2015 so I really gotta
believe that she knows what she's
talking about here and this is very very
far off all right I want to make the
point for some reason when we were
talking Windows 8 I felt like I was
betraying an inner part of myself as
like why am I trash-talking this why do
I have this fond memory of using it and
now I remember the only truly fond
memory I have of using Windows 8 it was
actually Windows 8 Windows 8/rt for
Windows 8.1 RT on the Lumia 2520 when we
had it because it was a really fun
experience i use done the entire train
ride down to New York City and I was
like this is really enjoyable and
obviously I think a large part of that
came came down to the hardware because I
liked using that device better than I
liked using the surface or the envy x2
the other two devices I run windows 8 on
mmm show yeah anyway let's move on we
will talk more about this rumor when it
is debunked or when the world turns
upside down and it comes true uh do you
want to talk about Nokia's big PR win
here Steven yeah Nokia's been nailing it
with these these PR events where it
finds some other company it's kind of
dropping the ball making themselves look
like a bit of a jerk and it gives like
hey check us we're cool they swung in
when a couple months back there was an
incident where Apple stole a video from
the sky and he was complaining about it
and Nokia had no interest in this
initially they were not involved but
they kind of swooped in like hey you
like videos check out this 10 20 here it
is for pretty and they got them a lot of
you know good food karma there and it
pretty much the same thing here where a
guy had an issue with Samsung it was he
was charging his phone for one reason or
another the phone did not like being
charged and caught a little bit on fire
just a little bit yeah and Samsung
wanted him to sign all these agreements
saying he wasn't going to talk anymore
about the incident for them to replace
the phone for him and they weren't in
replace it they're gonna replace it with
a comparable model no then they always
say that next to me they might be
refurbished right no but when you're
when you're doing that though when
you're like yeah not just drafting a
piece of boilerplate you're actually
like writing a new letter like you look
at it you don't say like a comparable
device you say will give you the same
phone yes Sam's like did not handle it
as well as they could but the issue
isn't Samsung's failing so much as Nokia
then reaching out to this guy and
they're hooking him up with I don't know
it's gonna get 10 20 but a new Lumia
model and it no he keeps this up i think
it could you know do a lot to restore
the public image they're not just
another arm of the faceless giant evil
Microsoft Nokia's are the fun guys they
help people out yeah I'd like to know if
if Casey nice dad is still using his
lumia 1020 okay we got to yeah I would
really like to know that as well ah well
I will say uh what what else is going on
this well we wrap up nokia here can we
talk about that last rumor about their
health i point to it yeah that's
supposedly 5.2 inch Lumia rumored to be
in the works what's the story here well
this awesome indian import/export
database which is rapidly becoming a
source for our information on upcoming
phones reveals that nokia i don't think
it says nokia a company in finland shift
a phone with a serial number that looks
a lot like how nokia does their serial
numbers sent it to india it's a
five-point to make sure we don't know
much about it resolution or anything we
can make some assumptions the stated
price makes it seem like it's going to
be relatively high end I think listen
the five hundred dollar range so 65 okay
so this could be something coming up
early next year new phablet for nokia
and a snapdragon 800 and probably a
1080p display and we've seen some rain
boots yeah we've seen some renders or
photos actually of devices that are
smaller than the 15
20 but running the new mega three row
like Start screen right oh yeah well
first we thought that that might be an
option for that can upgrade for lower
res displays but you don't know what's
going on there but we're kind of half
expecting that to be on the 929 right
the extra row of tiles I don't even know
at this point we've seen pictures of it
we have and and it makes sense with a
1080p to screen yet smaller on the 929
but anyway I wouldn't be at all
surprised to see to see that home screen
configuration or start showing a
configuration on the 929 and on this new
mystery device this RM 964 smartly
renewed key is going to have a device
every single size possible I know and
speaking of size though I wonder when I
see 5.2 my mind immediately goes to the
LG g2 and I wonder if this will be yet
another Lumia with a oh my god no mind
is mike and guys what is the G to have
its slcd three or no time to review ah
that would have been such a keen
sentence wouldn't it it has a display
it's probably color yeah oulad doesn't
get a hit also so slcd doesn't get a hit
well tell me what I with the display is
review oh it's an IPS LCD yes it would
be interesting to see because the 1520
has an LCD as well so be interesting to
see neither Lumia with an Okie the g2
the LG g2 yes correct has an IP IP s
plus true HD IPS plus thank you buddy
appreciate you as good as a week like
stuff it just falls out of our heads
right immediately so yeah thanks for
stew swooping back in for that and I'm
actually talking to Brandon right now
he's he's busting my balls over
something what's he would you're not
doing enough work what's going on oh no
I didn't talk about something enough in
the last video I made Oh Roger um you
know what I'm talking about I uh oh oh
god really yeah no no that's too bad
okay anyway let's not get any further
into the woods on that let's continue to
wrap up windows we're not too many
pieces of worthwhile news left but i
love this headline and i know we're out
of sequence so i will just kind of
it to you guys will Microsoft pay for
samsung to pay attention to them that's
not how you phrased it Steven but I
think that's basically the core of it
right yeah people think that Microsoft
is getting kind of desperate to help
flush out the windows phone selection in
terms of other OEMs besides Nokia and
actually this works into another ight
and we had on the run down here with
licensing fees but it seems like it's
doing anything it can to keep these
companies who might have been making
windows phone handsets in the past keep
them on board once nokia fully gets
absorbed into Reds devices and services
fully gets absorbed at the microsoft so
one of these rumors has been that
Microsoft end up and I'm directly paying
or just you there's not much of a brain
fart specifically we're talking about
rumors suggesting Microsoft could be
trying to lure Samsung with 1 billion
dollars yeah inside it could be
advertising compensation in some other
way but spending a billion dollars in
one way or another to keep Samsung
making windows phone handsets now to
cover ourselves completely this is from
the CSS tipster so you know who knows
but i find the question interesting to
ask because we're all sitting here
wondering what is i would love to be in
these meeting rooms when they when
microsoft is having conversations with
these makers in especially samsung who
created the achieve s which we found to
be a great windows phone then the tv's
neo which kind of is the same thing just
again and is not very good on sprint at
least and like nothing else really
except the achieve odyssey and wow it we
just assumed that they were going to
slowly you know like fade away and as
far as windows phone goes and I think
I've it seems to be it seems to me that
that's what Samsung would have done if
it weren't for Microsoft having to come
out but can you imagine their position
like Microsoft's coming over like hey
listen we know that we just bought a
nokia but you know we'd like you to
ignore still would be you have a lot of
hardware to compete directly with you
I've heard arguments that Samsung likes
to diversify itself and so maybe in that
sense it would make sense for the
company
Vaughn doing windows film at the same
time Samsung is a control freak I mean
the whole ring hope reasoning I did to
the whole Tizen thing was to have more
control over the platform this could be
the exact opposite case that it goes
with windows win unless Microsoft ends
up giving it some you know special nokia
level of Ingo that's exactly what I was
just going to say like if we can just
put our speculation hats on for a second
wouldn't that be amazing because we know
Samsung can do some cool things with
Windows Phone they were never given
permission to do the amazing innovative
stuff that nokia has been able to do but
Samsung's folders I know it's a simple
stupid thing to talk about but Samsung
lets you group apps into folders in
Windows Phone that is something no other
hardware manufacturer has ever done to
my knowledge unless Huawei did something
I personally feel if Samsung can get is
given that freedom huh it's gonna hurt I
guess probably the platform overall at
least in terms of how its reputation for
fluidity because Samsung is we all know
how great Samsung is at just bogging
everything down with hundreds of
features that nobody's ever going to use
absolutely then and that's a real point
to be made on Windows Phone if they are
able to take liberties with it because I
mean what would stop them then from you
know plastering their crap all over
everything Microsoft but it depends yeah
they won Samsung stick around right as
I'm saying if they're given the free
reign to do you know what they do then
it could be a bad thing for Windows home
I guess wonder if there are smartphone
shoppers out there who get it into their
head I want a samsung phone they may not
know about Android or care about it that
much or windows home for that matter
they just go into the store they say I
want a samsung smart phone and most of
the time there's not going to be that
Windows Phone option available for them
maybe that's a Microsoft is is counting
like it's playing off samsung's you
massive popularity that could well be
it's I mean I think that particular
breed of shopper is probably pretty rare
although Samsung and they don't say very
big they don't say I want a samsung
phone they say I want a samsung or yeah
we're specifically like I want a galaxy
yeah
often and that that carries with it the
android thing but i don't know i would
be interested in hearing how many times
in history a retail mobile phone clerk
has heard i want one of those at eve's
you got never from an ATM he had eight
oh god but i can we focus on one small
point that should be made here yeah
everyone says that windows phone is kind
of struggling and everything in the
microsoft is is in somehow some
desperate state to make it stick if if
Microsoft is willing to pay another
company not just for the first time
another company a billion dollars that
should tell you that Microsoft is really
not in any sort of trouble here and that
they have plenty of money to keep
fueling Windows Phone it for as long as
it wants yeah it's in this for the long
haul yeah it's making Microsoft is
making money from Android manufacturers
for still making Android so it's not
like it has anything to worry about as
long as the androids popular windows
phone is going to be around I just
really hope that we see an update soon
because when was a Windows Windows Phone
8 launch is hear the sounds like that
aight it was the first one wasn't it the
ax t it was the first one unannounced
ever gonna pronounce agree right it was
later what did they say creative like
Edith isn't what they were talking about
that press couple yeah but that's not
how you don't tell me how to think why
did they do that I never understood that
the like creative and I like I really
like it what it is so initially released
was October 29 2012 it's 13 months ago
and we that's what you saw sitting minor
feeling like yeah we saw a minor update
but it brought pretty much nothing force
closes in the multitasking rib and then
a couple other things and and like
rotation lock like accessories but and
I'm sure people will make the argument
that the OS doesn't need a refresh but
it really does in some areas i feel like
when i use windows phone now and i do
because i still do a wheel the Moto X in
the 1020 ah I find shut up i find i find
myself
sometimes inside Windows Phone I find
myself feeling like i'm using
abandonware particularly in the people
and the meat hub and if you've read my
stuff in the past month you you're tired
of hearing this and I'm sorry to repeat
myself but I'm tired your face Lou like
those things haven't those things came
out in 2010 and they were revolutionary
it's like my ourselves like you don't
have to use a separate app we just built
an operating system that plugs right
into your Twitter in your facebook and
takes care of that for you and it was
great and then Twitter and Facebook
evolved and Windows Phone really didn't
so that the functionality of the people
in me hub for for me is basically
crippled yeah I can post a status update
from it yeah I can vaguely see what
other people are doing sort of but so
much functionality has been broken or
just was never present as these social
networks developed and as Windows Phone
failed to keep up with it that I just
don't use them anymore I used the siloed
apps and as a result using Windows Phone
is far less distinctive for me and if I
were selling it I would have one less
reason to tell people to buy it so I I
never would have used those teachers to
begin with ever well you didn't really
come from webos I mean that was kind of
a oh it's like kind of dude Microsoft in
one to make you didn't mean it and I use
with webos for you don't a long time you
ain't nothing you ain't never hard yeah
I don't hear it in your voice yeah I
bought webos on day one I bought the
original pre or die I wasn't on the pre
plus the pre to the love the ring a you
measuring contest about how were bigger
say in fanboys go ahead dad up stay boy
but I am I gonna do know my second to be
a fan but I can be a fanboy out about a
dead platform for ya Microsoft I really
wanted to make Windows Phone 8 seem
fresh in light of these you know
building up problems are just not
addressing things they really could have
I think I managed to do that if the
rumored gdr3 three-column 720p support
happened he just would have looked
different enough to get users nicking 0
microsoft's you know keeping up with
this they're keeping things fresh even
though it's a very shallow change right
but sadly that did not happen oh I made
did you get distracted by the high just
came back into the chat like I just wait
wait let's see if we can bring him back
in here so he's gotta be back by day is
godly shipping office having gotten the
phone very quickly Taylor what uh
Brandon said so my god uh tell everyone
I said hi so there's Brandon's message
thanks for that thanks for that all
right the the Windows Phone listeners
will be will be pretty irritated by
giving up some of their time to hear hi
might talk about a phone they don't care
about but like when playing the three of
them I'm just oh you guys made the
same joke and it wasn't any fun blowfly
isn't funny huh i'm going to make shop
certain that we're gonna let me have 5
20 by the way we're gonna get uh
probably like 800 comments now about
from the very very vocal Windows Phone
fans you know it's funny they they've
been less I've been somewhat critical of
Windows Phones development as I just was
45 minutes and some I written pieces and
they've like calms down recently like I
feel like they only bump down really
inflammatory fan group at a time and
right now it's like that's trading
between LG and sony for me yeah sony
people those fans hate me but i want to
say that that that whole community is
very much more tame towards you when i
write about windows want to make a video
about Windows Phone people are like who
is this fanboy ok so the Instagram video
that i made about Instagram beta for
windows phone I said nothing negative
about the platform nothing at all I
really didn't talk about Windows Phone I
just said that having an official app
was good for the platform and like 30
comments were like who's this fan boy
where's Michael Fisher wide this guy get
this video like ya know the real problem
is problem the reason why we're seeing
this decline in the amount of fanboyism
going on a windows phone is because
Steve Ballmer has been operating about a
million sock puppet accounts and as he
gets ready to step down from CEO he's a
lot busier now who's here miss attention
to this so let's let's wrap it up on
Windows Phone what happened to me I made
couldn't join us he he must have sent us
a text to have skype from his phone
ah a text Skype I sound like my roommate
the other day right I'm like working in
my room I was like hey can you gchat
from an ipad I'm like what yes you know
that nobody calls a jeep at anymore Jeju
always felt God actually so did so did I
until they saw but then everyone on
Twitter made fun of me so I stopped
uh-uh I make funny you still Taylor
guess what let's go to a horrible
monster with Taylor like Hillary used to
be this nice mild-mannered dude and that
was just a giant bully I never was
incised at hawes trouble could Microsoft
eliminate licensing fees Stephen shank
not Taylor Martin who doesn't know
anything it's the same thing you say
they had to all right so what's the
story we didn't tell us tell us why
we're speculating about this quickly
rumor got out that Microsoft might stop
charging manufacturers to use both
Windows Phone and Windows RT but not
full blown windows 8 on tablets in the
products they released because currently
charges a per unit fee for for the
license on each device just like when
you buy a PC and has windows 8 loaded on
it Roger um and this sort of came up
earlier we were talking about a couple
months ago the idea that Microsoft again
someone puts out this notion that it's
desperate to get more companies involved
and that it would offer Windows Phone
free if they make dual boot devices its
back now we have forgotten about the
dual boot idea but maybe instead of
giving Samsung a billion dollars they
can't I sit by just saying you can make
Windows Phones won't cost you nothing
you can get more profit on each phone be
interested hmm hmm how accurate do we
think this rumor is was gonna say I'm
here it was it so the source of the
verge so it's probably pretty pretty
solid they know their stuff um what's a
V word I was looking for veracity what
is the veracity of this room that's what
I meant to ask I couldn't think of any
miss a minute ago we're having much luck
oh yeah no or having some horrible brain
problems here yeah so yeah yeah
Microsoft kind of devices is ready yeah
Tom war Tom Warren is always crazy
plugged into Windows Phone perhaps a lot
i would i would trust this yeah i would
say that they need to and it this goes
back to the whole acquiring nokia part
it's kind of the same thing that we
talked about when google bought motorola
it's going to upset the partners are
they still going to want to make android
devices obviously they were because
android is very successful but windows
phone is still kind of blossoming yeah
and and this is stepping on toes you
know it's not just you know oh the
creator of an open-source platform is
buying a hardware partner so they can
build hardware they're keeping it a
separate company they made that clear
but Microsoft did not make that clear
and this is not an open source operating
system it is a licensed paid premium
operating system and that that's a whole
different ballgame so I think for them
to for this whole situation to be a
little more smooth and less rocky and
abrasive I think they need to drop the
licensing fees I think Microsoft doesn't
need Windows Phone money it needs a
greater Windows Phone share and it might
do whatever it can take to do that you
know well we'll see I'm going to
contribute a little bit to Windows
Phones bottom line is I just got the
confirmation that i am going to go buy a
520 so I got to go to the Microsoft
Store and do that and as a result we got
to wrap up a bit of this podcast I'm
sure we're gonna have a lot of dialogue
in the in the comments on this one yeah
I gotta go to fedex and send the Moto G
back vitriol has another gig at second
good one yeah yeah I would always get a
vapid and vacuous mixed up back in the
day but I solved that problem for myself
I wanted to sleep in late yeah I know I
can rest a little easier I'm gonna bathe
always get cool and coolio mixed up but
that's just cuz my vernacular is not
that great very big problem well I still
get ice cube and iced tea mixed up but
that's that's my problem so another 1i
boot preferred not to watch either one
of them on screen really but I I get 50
cent the rapper ends a change mixed up
as well you have a problem that yeah
yeah it's tricky life is very silly and
I have 50 cent and I you know whip out
my lanta decent album and like all
whatever like what I don't need this
carrying the HTC One just so we can
listen to this
