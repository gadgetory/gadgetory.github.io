flagship Nokia Lumia device on an
American carrier you had to be with AT&amp;amp;T
well I got something in this bag here
that'll make Verizon Wireless customers
looking for a high-end Windows Phone 8
experience pretty happy I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow let's unbox the
Nokia Lumia 928 now not to worry
everybody we are gonna get our hands on
the Lumia 925 as well but we don't want
to leave our verizon followers out in
the cold and also we've been dealing
with the Lumia 920 as our flagship
device for a very long time it's gonna
be really great to get our hands on the
new hotness from Nokia pop open the bag
here there's our box turn it on over
here just to see wow this looks an awful
lot like the packaging for the Samsung
ativ Odyssey and also the Lumia 822
which we just returned bright red
Verizon branding there should be no
surprise it's just we haven't seen it in
a while let's see what it says on the
back ok so right on the box it tells us
what to expect within a 928 with a wall
charger data cable reference guide
product safety and warranty and global
support brochure it's one thing you
don't want to go without global support
brochure we like those as we actually
get to the unboxing itself we will take
the opportunity to remind you this is
the 928 is just basically a 920 that has
been dressed up you know the form factor
has been changed just a little bit for
Verizon obviously the Verizon Wireless
specific band adjustments and we'll get
to the other differences in a second but
at the same dual-core Qualcomm s4
Snapdragon 1 gig of ram with 1280 by 768
resolution screen and so on but there is
the device we're gonna go ahead and pop
the device clear of its casing so we can
see what's in the box and confirm that
inventory on the back there I'm just
here we have a Verizon Wireless Start
Guide still in its shrink-wrap as well
as a nokia AC charger us-style because
the Verizon Wireless phone and the data
cable nothing else in the packaging as
we were promised
we took a slight break just to get some
serial numbers off the phone but this is
the Lumia
9:28 our version here white on the back
there's the 4G LTE branding down below
the perforated holes for the
speakerphone here so you can get a
little bit of a tighter shot on that for
you very different in person it's it's
quite smooth you can feel it with your
thumb tip but it's not it's not quite as
pronounced in person kind of difficult
to describe we thought we were going to
be rather annoyed by that considering
that the 920 hides them down below but
you can tell it's the same styling it's
just been relocated so that's kind of a
nice surprise
Carl Zeiss pure review branding on the
camera bezel here and of course that big
ol xenon flash one of the big changes
between this and the Lumia 920 there's a
noise cancelling mic
I'm guessing USB port has been moved up
top interesting choice
probably not going to be our favorite
but we will see SIM card tray up top
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack
it looks like another microphone up
there unless yeah I think that's what
that is of course we're gonna have a
more detailed Hardware look at this once
we actually know what we were doing
camera button power standby volume up
and down and let's see if we can go
ahead and pry off the screen protector
here beautiful beautiful untouched
display under there and that display is
also different than the one on the Lumia
920 that's another one of the changes
made here from LCD to AMOLED so we're
expecting colors to pop as we power this
sucker on batteries already in there
obviously still still a non removable
battery and still capable of wireless
charging through the Qi wireless
charging standard something we'd love to
see we were sad to see it taking off the
Lumia 925 very happy to see it's still
present on the Lumia 928 we saw the
Verizon Wireless splash screen we also
see get another close shot of the
branding up here we see the Verizon
branding in the upper right very large
very pronounced compared to the AT&amp;amp;T
branding the more subtle AT&amp;amp;T branding
on the Lumia night
money not necessarily a great thing but
something we have to deal with and
probably a price that people looking for
a high-end Lumia on Verizon Wireless her
more than willing to pay those who wait
through the through the boot cycle here
we'll talk a little bit about the heft
of this unit
unlike the 925 you can see there's no
aluminum here this is still all
polycarbonate the edges have been
squared off so it feels definitely feels
different in the hand than the 9 20 and
we will be having a comparison by the
way between 9 29 28 but just right off
the bat we do want to say that this is
still quite hefty in the hand I don't
have a figure right in front of me for
the weight but we'll throw that in the
description there sim card is missing
this because we haven't put it in it and
there we are welcome to your Windows
Phone and yes indeed it will be my
Windows Phone for the next week or so
and stay tuned for our quick review for
now
this was unboxing the Nokia Lumia 928

Lumia 928 coming down the pipe including
our quick review next week stay tuned
