2015 and its name does indeed contain
the z4 moniker however it's not the
Xperia z4 smartphone but the Xperia z4
tablet a slate sony claims it's the
world's lightest and slimmest 10 inch
tablet well at least until somebody tops
that I'm Anthony Naga and this is
PocketNow first look at the Xperia z4
tablet you can only manufacture a
lightweight tablet and claim it to be
the lightest if you're using light
materials and glass is not among them so
don't expect to see it on the back of
this slate however expect to be
surprised at how light the Xperia z4
tablet feels at 389 grams for the Wi-Fi
only version and 390 340 LT enabled
variety it is even lighter than the
already lightweight Apple iPad air 2 we
are still recovering from our amazement
it is that light and if you get past the
initial surprise you'll be amazed a
second time at how thin the tablet is
6.1 millimeters that is really thin
but despite the lightweight and thin
form factor it doesn't feel at all on
substantial it is sturdy well-built and
you won't be afraid to handle it
worrying that it might bend or break we
think the white color doesn't really do
it any justice as we prefer the looks of
the black version but that's a matter of
a personal preference performance
however is not and then 2015 we no
longer accept to see Android flagship
tablets that are lagging luckily this is
not the case with the Xperia z4 tablet
as we did not manage to bug down the
demo unit a unit everybody was abusing
on the show floor that has a lot to do
with the flagship internals sony has
packed inside from the 64-bit Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor clocking at 2
gigahertz to the Adreno 430 GPU all the
way to the three gigs of ram Android
lollipop helps a lot as well as the
tablet chips with this version out of
the box and the fairly toned-down sony
UI at least compared to previous
versions is also a big help in
maintaining a fluid operation all
the way throughout despite the otherwise
beautiful 10.1 inch 2k display which is
extremely bright sony claims long
battery life up to 17 hours of video
playback we are not able to verify that
until we extensively use the tablet but
the 6,000 milliamp hour battery and
gentle power handling on the processor
are probably the ones to thank for this
like any of Sony's recent flagship
offerings the z4 tablet is also water
and dust proof with an ip65 and ip68
compliant build additionally you get 32
gigs of internal storage that's
expandable and a pair of 8.1 and 5.1
megapixel shooters for the back and
front respectively LTE capability is
present on the cellular enabled version
and the audio files among you will be
happy to hear high res audio coming out
of the headphone jack or blasting from
the stereo front-facing speakers during
our short time with lollipop and Sony's
own skin we found it to be stutter or
lag free those who owned previous Sony
smartphones or tablets will feel right
at home and those who will use the
tablet for the first time we'll have a
short learning curve the new Sony UI is
relatively lightweight and the
beautifully executed Walkman or album
applications will make sure you enjoy
media consumption on the device you'll
have to get used to some of Sony's
candy-like icons but they're not too
heavy on your senses and lollipop is
dominant both in key regions like the
navigation buttons notification tray
multitasking some of the menus settings
to a certain degree and so on repair
your wallet for June wherever you live
if this tablet has got your attention
wait for our full review coming shortly
on pocket now to see whether our final
impressions will match the first ones
