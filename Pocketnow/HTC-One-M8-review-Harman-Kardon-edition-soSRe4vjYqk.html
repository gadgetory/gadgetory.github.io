Audio and took the controversial
technology off its flagship smartphone
line it came as welcome news to audio
files many of whom reviled Beats
destructive effects on music but it also
left HTC with one less differentiator in
a very competitive landscape with the
Harman Kardon edition of the One m8 HTC
looks to change that at least on one US
carrier this audio centric variant is
exclusive to Sprint and the carrier is
using it in conjunction with a big
Spotify deal to try to boost its own
visibility in the high-end smartphone
scene but is an outstanding audio
experience enough to convince
subscribers to stick with the carrier
that's been losing customers for the
past two years let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our video review of the HTC One m8
Harman Kardon Edition on the hardware
side we're looking at almost exactly the
same One m8 we detailed in our full
review available for your eyeballs here
on youtube and at pocket now linked in
the description below same awesome
display same HTC Sense same love it or
hate it duo camera obviously this one is
back and sprint specific radios for 3G
and 4G and it also features a sporty or
paint job jet black aluminum with
champagne accents on the camera lens
around back and across the top and
bottom panels on the face and minimal
Harman Kardon branding on the tail bone
as always whether you prefer this livery
to the standard colors will depend on
your personal preference the only
objective downside is that the black
surface shows smudges more readily but
that's a small price to pay for the
other out of box standout the high-end
Harman Kardon earbuds bundled with the
device these buds are the AES model a
variation on the AE available from
Harman Kardon for a sale price of around
80 bucks they're bigger and heavier than
most inbox earbuds made of aluminium
alloy for added bass and low frequency
reproduction and featuring nine
millimeter drivers for extended dynamic
levels and high sound pressure levels
according to the company's website now I
don't know what any of that means really
but you don't need to be an audiophile
to know when you're handling premium
hardware everything from the build of
the inline control collective to the
gauge of the wire screams high end and
up against typical in earbuds from HTC
or Samsung the AES models definitely
live up to their vaunted brand name the
added base is probably the most
noticeable with a throaty or thump and a
much richer sound on the low end while
other parts of the range are brighter
sharper more defined every OEM set just
sounds thin and tinny by comparison with
the Harman Kardon but even callers said
we sounded more authentic through the
inline mic though they said noise
cancellation was better on the stock HTC
headset the downsides to the aes buds
are fairly minor there is some crackling
if you really blast the volume which I
didn't expect from such an expensive
accessory also the sharp corners on the
casings might irritate you depending on
the shape of your ears and the inline
volume controls don't always work as
designed
instead of making music louder or softer
they skip tracks instead whether you're
using the google play music player the
stock HTC app or Spotify and contrary to
what you might expect from an audio
files handset Spotify is a major
consideration here Sprint's deal with
the company extends six months of free
membership to One m8 buyers and it's not
just the earbuds that make the Harman
Kardon model here an ideal match the
phone brings a software enhancement
called clarify that promises to restore
the quality of compressed audio also
here live stage which is said to give
onboard audio you guessed it a more live
sound but on first listen I can't seem
to make out all the differences I should
be hearing from the software the kind of
enhancements that Miriam Schwarz spoke
about on the latest pocket and weekly
podcast what they're doing is they're
there over sampling up sampling low
sample row normal sample rate audio to
192 which will make a difference so I
took a trip to see someone who would be
able to tell whether clarify was doing
its job professional DJ audiophile and
friend of the PocketNow weekly Chris
Larson whose ears I trust above most
others I set him up with the freshly
gelled aes buds and took him through
several songs over the course of 30
minutes toggling clarify and live stage
on and off
here's what we found of the two modes
live stage is the more aggressive
flattening some of the highs and adding
a slight bit of reverb the effect is a
track that sounds more immediate and
less harsh on sibilant sounds like the
claps and the high hats so with live
stage enabled the sound is more pleasant
to my ear but the condensed dynamic
range might not best reflect the artists
intention so if you're the type of music
lover who places authenticity above
everything live stage may not be for you
clarify is another story we kept our
Spotify settings on extreme throughout
our testing so some songs didn't sound
different at all with clarify compared
to without but when we downloaded a
track from the Google Play Store clarify
brightened up the mix making things seem
warmer richer the difference was
significant enough that in a blind taste
test
Chris preferred the Harman Kardon m8 run
and clarify to the older M aid with
standard boom sound citing wider dynamic
range and a clearer more precise sound
back in the sound booth the Harman
Kardon One m8 isn't done surprising us
while live stage isn't available in
loudspeaker mode and the difference in
amplitude between the two versions is at
most one decibel the Sprint version
really does sound better
maybe it's the clarify working its magic
but it's just a little extra oomph that
we appreciate and let's not forget the
devices other capabilities like the LG
g2 before it this version of the One m8
supports 24 bit 192 kilohertz playback
so if you go to a site that offers high
quality song downloads you can move
those FLAC files right to the phone
jumping back and forth between the
extreme quality Spotify version and the
flack download of a track from the
national the difference was apparent to
my ears if not necessarily mind-blowing
sadly this being a sprint exclusive
there are some downsides and well
they're exactly where you'd expect while
Sprint's LTE throughput can be quite
impressive in our experience that's
performance limited to the outdoors move
inside and speed crashes into the
basement along with signal strength and
most of the time it's fine
ding 4G coverage that's the hard part
more often than not you're trapped on a
slow 3G signal that the device
annoyingly holds on to even after it's
moved into an LTE area we had more jumps
and stutters streaming Spotify on this
device than we've had on AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon
in months while Sprint's new HD voice
service and its promised high quality
calling may be enough to counter some of
those obstacles it's not going live till
this summer so the question of whether
the Harman Kardon One m8 is the device
for you depends almost entirely on
whether you're a sprint customer if you
are and you're happy with coverage where
you live and work there's a lot of value
to be had in Sprint's Fram lay plans
which include some significant discounts
on Spotify access and if you're an
audiophile the extra 30 bucks you pay
over the standard One m8 on a contract
is trivial considering the huge bump
you're getting in earbuds and audio
capabilities but as Taylor Martin
recently demonstrated it doesn't take
much for the dedicated smartphone
Tweaker to port many of these
capabilities to a plain vanilla one m8
when you consider that along with the
fact that the standard one I made itself
sounds pretty awesome on both
speakerphone and headset it's tough for
us to recommend jumping to sprint just
for this device unless the framily plan
is a very good fit for you or you really
really like the color black once again
