vice and report the news somebody please
get this guy a girlfriend iphone 5 a.m.
you're new here aren't you wait what's
your name homie bond James Bond that's
right it's that time of the week I am
high metal event out of this is pocket
now and this is our pocket out daily
recap for last week so on Monday asked
you if you would buy the surface 2 or
the surface pro 2 microsoft that just
announced their new tablets and
obviously the first generation products
did not take off at all we have 135
comments out of which Eddie says I would
love a surface pro if it was free price
way too high LOL you're never going to
get it free this is a full-fledged
computer it's kind of priced accordingly
but i do understand your point i mean
it's a tablet trying to complete with
tablets with the computers price so yeah
there's a problem there then our lead
reg says surface to pro for me the
highest productivity tablet and you're
kind of right it is the highest
productivity tablet but then again these
have existed for more than 10 years and
in 10 years they never sold so i don't
know what changes now and george 189
says microsoft should seriously consider
making a nexus 7 competitor not only
screen wise with price wise a windows
tablet causing 250 to 300 dogs would be
sweet and yes you are right that would
be the sweet spot I don't understand
Microsoft right now I mean they've
always been aggressive about pricey and
then now their service tablets are not
then on Tuesday I asked you what was
your device in 2008 what was your first
Android device and what the vice were
you currently using Android was turning
five years old and we wanted to get
nostalgic we have 1558 comments out of
which one youtuber says the phone I was
using in 2008 was a silver flip phone
with a monochrome screen how did you
survive man the next says 2008 nokia
3310 first android device the galaxy ace
in print was the Lumia 920 and that
Nokia 3310 was indestructible I can but
you still have that phone right now then
Stefan says my first android device was
the HTC hd2 and yes you're right Matt
the hd2 was the device back then it was
just an awesome phone all over I wish it
got 3g bands here for me to get it but
still he has a lot of people got android
this way and yeah I kind of did
my first android device was the nexus
one which I love to death still today
but back then I was actually able to get
android running on my touch pro2 from
HTC which was just awesome and on
Wednesday asked you if you would
consider the Galaxy S line to be dated
because well there are rumors of a
galaxy F line up with monster specs and
you know probably even better materials
and construction we have 465 comments
out of which what it says the Galaxy S
series is not dated and calm down buddy
you know you mad then bends jay says
Samsung is dropping an f-bomb OMG in you
know you're right i mean i even said it
imagine people coming up to you and
saying you got an F it doesn't sound
right what's with the f them another
commenter says maybe the FS for galaxy
flex s in flexible display hmm you got a
really good point there i mean but why
not just call it the galaxy flex and
yeah i just i still can't find the point
in flexible displays I mean yes Samsung
and LG have been the companies that have
ordered flexible displays but still the
rumors for LG is that we're getting
curved displays just like the Nexus S
and the Galaxy Nexus so this has been
done by Samsung in the past 10 really
understand lucky innovation here is so
we'll see then on thursday i asked you
of iowa seven would get you dizzy apple
support forums are flocked with comments
out there that we're wondering if
they're real or fake so we have 140 6
comments out of which what on says my
wife now gets headache since updating to
iOS 7 on her 4s and buddy you're lucky
that it's happening until now because
the majority of the human race has been
having problems with headaches and their
wives ever since the beginning of time
Johanson says iowa 7 has not been giving
me busyness at all and i've been using
it since beta 1 and i have your same
case I don't have any issues with it and
then Daniel Lee says fake comments and
you know it wouldn't be new we've heard
of companies hiring other companies to
use commenting systems of other websites
to you know stare opinion in a negative
direction and we remember how blown out
of proportion things were with the
iphone foreign antennagate and then
let's cuff get on the iphone 5 obviously
people are looking for ways to the squid
the iphone 5s after nine million years
if it's sold in the first weekend so
it'd be the case and finally on friday i
asked you if you will consider it to be
a good idea for the iWatch to focus on
that
as in the reason why was because Apple
have just hired the guy that was behind
the Nike FuelBand we have 247 comments
out of which for example whoever Mendoza
says having an iWatch would only mean
fashion for me I only see it to be
useful for glancing notifications and
you know what smartwatches and
notifications have existed for a long
time and they have not taken off because
of that so I doubt that the iWatch will
focus on that another commenter says I
still use my ipod nano as a watch and
you know I actually tried to do that
ones and the reason why I pulled back
was because the ipod nano is not
waterproof so it kind of became
pointless then Zach Getty says I love
the idea of the iWatch but I hope that
it has more than just fitness and you've
got a solid point I love fitness and I
would love to get a good fitness tool
but the problem is that Fitness watches
are ugly and I don't see myself buying
or paying 150 dollars for a fitness
watch that i'm only gonna use for
fitness so yes i would love it to do a
lot more but of course i would also love
for that whole f7 technology to reach
that i watch and ring as an elegant way
to do it so again let's see how that
turns out that's probably gonna happen
until 2014 anyways that's it for our
pocket out daily recap thank you very
