and sales even after its premium
offerings rumors claim that Apple and
Samsung are ready to take the steps to
oled and the US version of the Sony
Xperia z5 might take a few steps back
I'm hi meri behna and while I go party
and karaoke tonight you better be doing
something similar this is barking out
daily official news today start with
Microsoft as the company has just made
its bridge for iOS official and sort of
a way it's not really out there yet the
company is already asking for
submissions for any developers
interested in porting their iOS
applications to windows 10 mobile or
Windows 10 for that matter but then
again we're not exactly sure how that's
going to go because even though that's
going to be quick when those 10 mobile
devices are rather limited right now and
they don't perform well then another
news from sony we were happy to hear
that the company has decided to bring
the xperia z5 and z5 compact to the
United States as a februari 7th but this
is rather interesting as we've got some
sources claiming that you won't get the
full package it seems that you will not
be getting the fingerprint scanner for
reasons we do not understand stay tuned
for that now let's cool the spotlight
over to Samsung and Apple as we've been
hearing the possibility of an iphone
with an oled display for quite some time
we heard that there were negotiations
between LG and Samsung for this to come
to Apple devices and as it turns out
we've got more sources now claiming that
the deal is almost closed up to the
point where we might expect something to
happen soon that we're not exactly sure
of that means iPhone news or Apple watch
news stay tuned for that and speaking of
Samsung have you thought that the
competition with LG had ended think
again we've got the korea times already
claiming that we should expect a
flagship from LG from its event at mwc
and again this is something new the
company regularly does not use mwc we
usually see the new galaxy and then
eventually we get to see the new LG G
something and it actually ends up
launching before the galaxy and so on
and so forth but yeah it seems that the
g5 could make it to the event and we
will be covering it live from Barcelona
and finally the very interesting news
that they have
with market share and sales we hear
about how things are going for samsung
and it was really a highlight for all
companies but everything else was
expected the most important one was
really Samsung because while they've
lost one point eight percent in sales
overall in 2015 three percent in market
share which is a crazy figure of you
considerate and wonder exactly why the
company has invested a lot and bringing
the quality of hardware that we wanted
from galaxy phones and it just seemed
like if that strategy didn't really pay
off but it does lead me to the question
of the day what exactly do you think
Samsung did wrong with its new Galaxy
smartphones in my case I love the design
but essentials like storage and battery
should have been figured out in my
opinion leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know what you think friends
