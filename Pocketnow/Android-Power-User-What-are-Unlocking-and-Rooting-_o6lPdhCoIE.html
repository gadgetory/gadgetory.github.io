things that we hear quite a bit whenever
we hear about Android and sometimes even
when we hear about iOS but with iOS it's
called jailbreaking they're not the same
thing unlocking and routing but it's not
too difficult to see why there's some
confusion there I'm Joe Levi and today
on the Android power user see if we
can't clear up some of that confusion
when we're talking about unlocking and
rooting your device the unlocking part
has to do with unlocking the bootloader
there are some other things that you can
unlock like sid and sim unlocking we're
not talking about those this is your
bootloader and we talked about the
bootloader on the last episode of
Android power user so if you don't
remember that hit pause and hit this
link so you can go back to it that
having been said locking your bootloader
well that's something that comes done
right out of the box that's right your
phone or your tablet
chances are it's already locked as soon
as you get it and you turn it on so
locking a bootloader is a lot like
locking your house to get in you have to
have a key it's a really a good thing
right because it keeps all the bad guys
from just walking into your house and
stealing all your stuff the analogy is
pretty similar with a bootloader except
with a bootloader unlike your house the
manufacturer doesn't give you a key and
you can't get into your house so pretty
much the analogy breaks down at that
point but it does keep the bad guys out
and it keeps bad applications from doing
things that you may not want them to do
to your device when your bootloader is
locked it means you can't go in and put
on a custom recovery image you can't put
on a custom ROM most of the time you
can't even modify system files it's not
all that fun and it doesn't let you do a
lot of things that you want to do then
again it doesn't let you do a lot of
things that the OEMs and probably the
carrier's too don't want you to do which
is
probably the leading force on why boot
loaders come locked straight from the
factory even when the majority of the
OEMs have said we will provide a tool to
let you unlock your bootloader they just
didn't tell us when most of the time
that's after the device has been out on
the market for a while other times it's
right away the device is released week
or so later you can unlock it with
Google devices you can unlock in the
minute you get them Google's got a tool
you just connect it to your computer and
OAM unlock tada you're done so now that
we've talked about unlocking let's talk
about routing they usually go
hand-in-hand and they usually go in that
order though not necessarily always in
that order
routing is giving your device route
level permissions usually immediately
after you've done that you apply a
package of tools that lets you use Super
User permissions and super user tools
root and super user though technically
not the same type of permissions they're
not exactly the same but we use those
words pretty much interchangeably in the
Android community even though they're
technically not the same most of what we
do is super user super user you get a
whole bunch of tools that lets you do
all kinds of things usually that comes
along with the package called busybox
once you do all kinds of low-level stuff
that you normally wouldn't be able to do
because those tools aren't included well
because nobody needs those tools right
except for Android power users and we do
and we can depending on your device you
may not need to unlock before you root
in fact you might be able to do
something called a soft root now a soft
root is something that goes away when
you turn off your device or specifically
when you power it down not just when you
put it into sleep but still it's
something nice that you can have and get
around and do what you need to do and
then of course you lose it when you when
you power down it and back up and it's a
pain and it's annoying but oh well at
least we're able to do it perma route is
when you've got route all the time it's
a good thing and it can be a bad thing
because you see you've just essentially
taken the locks off of your door and I
know we're mixing the unlocking and the
routing now but now
any app that you install on the device
has the possibility to use all of those
root level permissions they can walk
right into your house and do whatever
they want steal your stuff steal more of
your stuff sleep in your bed eat your
cereal just dogs and cats living
together total chaos hopefully they
don't do that but they can and you've
got to be kind of careful when you are
applying
root-level permissions but what you can
do with it remember all those bloatware
apps that you've had pre-loaded on your
phone I'm not gonna mention any carrier
names but one of them whose colors are
bright red comes to mind I don't like
them I want them gone and I can't do
that unless I have root and then I can
go ahead and clean them out real easy
it's not difficult at all but because
they are system apps I can't remove them
until I have root okay so talking about
system apps I can replace system apps
let's say I've got a nexus 7 and I want
to be able to use it as a honking big
phone you can do it you've got to
replace some system apps to be able to
do it and of course there's no cellular
circuitry or antennas inside so you got
to do it over Wi-Fi and whatnot so it's
kind of complicated but luckily we have
an article we talked about that a pocket
now there will be a link in the article
at pocket now if you want to go and find
out how to use your Nexus 7 as a phone
but you can do that with root because
you can replace some system files and
some change some system configurations
it's pretty easy if you follow the
instructions precisely we'll just leave
it at that some other stuff that route
lets us do ironically it lets us backup
and restore our phones and our tablets
and our tablets and everything in
between
why can't we do that without root well
you've got to be able to get down and
have access to those system level files
to be able to access and copy them off
and without root you don't have that now
theoretically you could if there was a
backup API but of course there's not so
the only way to really backup your
device so that you can restore it later
is
you have root access it's kind of
frustrating but that one reason alone to
me is justification for rooting your
device and there we have it unlocking
and rooting in a nutshell and the
bootloader if you didn't catch up on
that make sure you watch last week's
episode of Android power user if you've
got any questions any comments if you've
got recommendations for future topics
please leave those over at pocketnow.com
we'll have a link for it right here if
you're not over on pocketnow.com already
if you're watching this on the youtube
channel make sure you head over to
pocket now so you can leave comments
over there that's where I will be to
answer your questions and that's where
the rest of the PocketNow staff will be
to help with your comments your
questions complaints and really anything
else that you want to vent to us at that
point if you've got some other cool
stuff that you can do with route let us
know that as well for PocketNow and the
android power user I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
