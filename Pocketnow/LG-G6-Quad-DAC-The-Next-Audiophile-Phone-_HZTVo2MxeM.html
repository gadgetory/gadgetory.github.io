with a quick follow-up to a video we put
out earlier this week we did a rumor and
wish list roundup on the LG g6 one of
the things that we mentioned in that
video was that the potential next
generation flagship phone from LG was
going to have a brand new quad DAC
potentially an even better quad DAC than
the one found in the LGB 20 we should at
least mention what makes the V 20 so
special and there are really two things
going on that make this phone such a
beefed signal processing and output
power we've seen a number of
manufacturers claim 24-bit audio support
and sure those phones might be able to
playback 24-bit audio files but the
actual output coming from the jacket
into your ears is usually truncated down
to 16-bit you're not really getting
everything you paid for if you're one of
those individuals who does invest in
super high quality audio files v28
having none of that
when LG says this is a 32-bit DAC not
only will the software play a 32-bit
audio file the headphone jack will
properly output the full frequency
response of a 32-bit audio file for
those who don't understand what that
means
that's ridiculous overkill as the
frequency response range of 32-bit audio
will extend past what dogs can hear
already I can feel the audio file nerd
rage war which is about to break out in
their comments the people who believe
that you don't need anything more than
16-bit audio the people who prefer
24-bit audio regardless of what camp
you're in you would still want the
highest quality presentation for those
audio files and that brings me to the
real ear candy that you get on the V 20
and that's the amp I still need to do
that explaining the video on headphone
impedance but regardless the V 20 is
very intelligent in how it detects what
type of headphones you're using wrapping
up that little detour on why the V 20
was so formidable and getting back to
the g6 the point of this video there are
still plenty of areas where I feel LG
could improve the signal processing and
the output on a future phone LG working
with ESS they're the manufacturer of the
dax and the v10 in the b20 they really
wouldn't have to do much to
scientifically improve the g6 to claim
those audio improvement Vic
it would only take a handful of subtle
tweaks to improve things like the
signal-to-noise ratio the difference
between the general noise floor that all
audio gear creates and the actual audio
you want to listen to the stereo
crosstalk in a stereo system we like to
keep those channels as separate as we
can but there will always be some leak
from your right ear into your left ear
and from your left ear into your right
ear or maybe even just clean up some of
the harmonic distortions that we would
find in all portable electronics those
distortions becoming more prevalent as
we start using higher bitrate audio
files do any of those points sound like
they're going to be really exciting
improvements to your music listening
experience probably not when we went
from the v10 to the b20 the improvements
were pretty subtle and that's my
prediction for the g6 - I think we're
going to see something iterative it will
be an improvement but I don't think it's
going to blow the doors off mobile audio
yet in a world where more manufacturers
are looking to get rid of that 3.5
millimeter Jack any improvement to the
cabled listening experience built into
our phones is going to be appreciated by
us fans of using nicer headphones I mean
even if you're not using nicer
headphones a better source is a better
source and of course we want to hear
from you when LG says they're going to
improve the quad DAC on the g6 over the
v20 what do you think they're going to
bring to the table what do you hope to
see in any future phone and if listening
to audio is a primary usage of your
smartphone will Hardware like this
motivate you to pick up the next
generation LG drop us a comment down
below this video let's see if we can
strike up some conversations on audio
and music listening as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for more coverage of
future smartphones set to debut at MWC
as I'm about to get on a plane to
Barcelona to go and check this stuff out
I'm really excited about that trip and
helped us out with some sharing on your
favorite social network for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now so I'm gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
