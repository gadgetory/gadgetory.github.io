got a good look at a bunch of them
thanks to a meeting we had with Faso
here at CES 2019 this is vodka now and
I'm Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and let's take a look at a
bunch of new we're 2.0 watches that are
coming out from the Faso group we'll
start off with a few new smartwatches
from Kate Spade this whole collection
however is new in general and it's
called the scallop 2 SmartWatch
collection you have this scalloped
design all around the top ring of the
watch you'll also see that the bodies of
the watches are smaller for the smaller
wrists out there but of course as this
is a Kate Spade collection they are made
for women and that's one thing that's
really looking great here on these Smart
Watch is the fact that Smart Watch
bodies are starting to get a lot slimmer
and a lot smaller all around so they're
much more accessible to a lot of people
aside from the different types of watch
bands that you can get including leather
straps silicone straps and metal clasp
watchbands you also get a couple of
controls over on the side including a
dial yes that's actually a dial so you
don't really have to be swiping all over
the place you can also roll that dial in
order to get up and down the interface
there's also another button that is made
for shortcuts and aside from that you
have where 2.0 which has gotten a really
needed refresh out this past a year one
that made it much better compared to
what it was before when it used to be
branded Android wear they do still use
the Snapdragon wear 2100 processor and
they have the 300 million power battery
that should hopefully give you up to two
days of battery life another great
feature for these Kate's based
smartwatches is a new micro app that is
built into the where OS operating system
of each watch it's called the choose
your own basically it is an interface
that asks you what color many different
parts of your wardrobe might be and it
will cater a watch face to the type of
wardrobe you might have with your Kate
Spade SmartWatch it's a nice way of
actually matching all of your
accessories to your clothing and it's
great to see that technology is starting
to bridge that gap between it fashion
and lifestyle if you're looking for the
Snapdragon wear 3100 there is only one
watch that is available or actually was
available during our demo and that would
be the fossil sport now the fossil sport
may not actually be new for 2019 for CES
2019 rather but we are taking a look at
it for the first time here and I gotta
say I can't wait to actually get my
hands or rather to get this watch around
my wrist and use it on the daily because
it feels like this is the SmartWatch
where OS has been needing fashion and
all the features aside the fossil sport
is just an incredibly light SmartWatch
and it's something that surprises you at
first where the body is actually quite
minimalist even though there are so many
different colors of the watch body and
of the watch straps it's just a simple
circle with again the two buttons that
flanked the dial in the middle where OS
2.0 is still a bit new to me but I
really enjoy how it looked on this
particular screen just swiping up down
left right depending on what elements I
actually wanted to see and with that in
mind all of the different features you
would expect from where OS 2.0 are
working really well on the fossil
support you still get the NFC payments
on the go you also get Google assistance
and it all looks really great on this
minimalistic sports SmartWatch this is
also a swim proof watch so you can
actually get into the pool with these
and maybe do some watersports and it's
also going to have the IP certifications
needed to brave the elements I'll say it
one more time what is really surprising
about the fossil sport now that I've
gotten a look at it is the fact that it
is that light it's easy to forget that
this would be on your wrist and I think
that on the daily it's one of those
watches that you wouldn't realize you're
wearing until you actually have to
charge it and with Snapdragon wear 3100
you should have to charge it a little
bit less we will have to test that out
when we finally get a fossil sport on
our own wrists so you can look forward
to that and more from CES 2019 from us
here at pocket now keep it tuned here
and drop us some lifes on these videos
don't forget to get into the comment
sections and let us know what you think
about the future of smartwatches
especially when companies like the Faso
grip are really putting out some great
new additions thank you so much for
watching our coverage so far of CES 2019
and look forward to our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
