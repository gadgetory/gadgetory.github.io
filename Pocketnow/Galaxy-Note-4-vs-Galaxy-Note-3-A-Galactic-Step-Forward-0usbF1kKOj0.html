the US and for the third year in a row
the question is the same buy the new one
or save some cabbage by picking up last
year's model
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
we're about to find out
in samsung galaxy note 4 vs samsung
galaxy note 3
these may not look too different on the
surface but as usual the real story is
in the subtleties in the hand the Galaxy
Note 4 is sleeker but larger spelter but
more massive simpler yet more
sophisticated the stitching that evoked
the feel of an old notebook gone that
weirdo USB 3.0 port kicked out the fake
chrome plastic side rails replaced with
an aluminium magnesium alloy even the
buttons have gotten a mechanical redo
with increased travel and feedback and
the display protection on the note 4 is
more robust than the note threes with
the glass also tapering slightly at the
edges rather than writing slightly below
the edges as before while the screens
are the same diagonal size the
resolution takes a huge step up on the
note 4 its quad HD versus the Full HD of
its predecessor and color accuracy has
been improved as well can you discern
these improvements with the naked eye
honestly it depends on your eyeball then
given how fine the detail and how
powerful the colors on even the note 3's
display the difference here really feels
like splitting hairs
unless you're downloading a lot of Super
HD content one benefit to this added
resolution is that minimized memos on
the home screen remain readable even at
very small sizes so if that's your bag
well there you go while things like the
display and internals will grab their
share of headlines the big difference
for us comes down to feel and hand the
note lineup is Samsung's showcase for
muscle flexing
it's where the company shows off how
much raw power it can cram into a single
handset and in that context the new note
doesn't just feel superior in the hand
it's fortified construction actually
makes more sense and plays a role in
telling the story of the note family
we're comparing AT&amp;amp;T review units here
so our note 3 is actually quite a bit
behind the times on its software build
well you can obviously get a newer OS on
the note 3 on a different carrier or
just use a custom launcher the gulf
gives us a fun window into how much
samsung's interface design has changed
in just a year now Samsung's UI remains
thick and heavy on each but it's far
clunkier on the old note 3
the multitasking screen is a long press
of the HOME key away and it's that old
multitasking ribbon not the new card
like interface with its own dedicated
button the gaudy bright colors have been
replaced by transparencies on the for
those black square high contrast toggles
have become friendly low-impact circles
and my magazine has been rebranded as
briefing and given a much more modern
look it's also somewhat faster one of
our favorite elements from the note 3
has been expanded in the 4th gen the
ability to run two apps side by side in
multi window now you can start it right
from the card stack you can drag apps
into floating windows via a swipe down
from the corner you can even collapse
them into bubbles like Facebook chat
heads and one-handed usability has been
further improved a side panel is
available that gathers some system
controls right under your thumb you can
also shrink the entire screen to one
side as on the galaxy s5 all these
options fall under a dedicated section
of the note force settings and it's good
to see Samsung thinking smartly about
how to make bigger devices easier to use
lest you think we've got universal
praise for these changes that's not
entirely the case the settings screen
has been redesigned twice in the years
since we saw the note 3 and it's really
neither better nor worse there's still
an unacceptable delay when calling up
briefing or the multitasking screen or
other system elements the one-handed
mode is difficult to call up
consistently and much of the iconography
is still cartoonish this is still
Samsung software and we go into greater
detail on what that means in our full
review part of what makes the note the
note is the s-pen the only smartphone
stylus that makes sense in 2014 the new
s-pen is a bit longer than the texturing
has been changed but otherwise these are
basically identical it's the software
that's been redesigned and mostly for
the better Samsung added a bunch of
s-pen features to last year's Note 3 and
while we'd still like to see some of the
clutter eliminated there's been some
honing here to make it more like the
mouse we want it to be you can press and
hold the Pens button to highlight text
which you can then copy or share more
easily or you can hold the button and
drag a box around multiple files to
select them all
and the Wacom digitizer pressure
sensitivity has been doubled on the new
note allowing for more precise doodling
among other things shortcomings do
remain of course auto scrolling with the
s-pen still won't happen in some apps
while it will and others annoying also
the s-pen itself now feels a bit cheap
and plasticky next to this year's metal
rimmed handset and some interface
wrinkles persist even after four
generations of note but overall we're
happy with the new features and we're
glad Samsung continues to improve one of
the notes halo differentiators the jump
from 13 to 16 megapixels isn't the cool
part of the new notes camera versus the
old one
it's the optical image stabilization the
note 4 brings to the equation which
gives the new phone a much smoother
viewfinder experience lets it shoot
video with reduced handshake and helps
it take longer exposures in low light
modes
sure enough the note 4 delivers much
better focus and truer colors in those
darker settings especially where the
previous generation struggled with
artificial light differences are harder
to make out in broad daylight but look
closer and change up the illumination a
little and you'll see how the camera has
gotten better at fighting blowout in
overexposed areas colors are also more
authentic now in artificial lighting the
enhanced contrast and the added
resolution make photos noticeably
crisper and cleaner on the note 4 even
in less than ideal shooting situations
there seems to be a slightly wider field
of view on the note 4 as well which
helps when framing close shots and HDR
mode is just as effective at drawing up
detail from the darkness videos a little
smoother but the real benefit to the
note Forest camcorder is that it keeps
focus more easily other improvements are
in line with what we saw on the stilt
and all we're very pleased with the
optical upgrade here we criticized the
note 3 for its lack of adaptability and
Samsung seems to have taken the
criticism to heart even the front-facing
camera on the note 4 brings much less
noise and blur than its predecessor a
note is more than an S Pen more than a
big chassis as much as anything else
Note stands for horsepower then the
fourth generation takes it up a notch in
the specs departments the silicon on our
us review unit is a Snapdragon 805
versus the 800 in the year ago model
with a faster clock speed and enhanced
graphics processing the ram count is the
same though as is the 32 gigs of
on-board storage and the microSD
expansion not the same is acoustic
performance noise cancellation has been
improved on the revised note which comes
in handy whenever the breeze kicks up
Samsung has moved the speaker from the
bottom edge back to its former position
on the back cover which to be honest
we're not happy with but in doing so the
company has made the speaker louder and
clearer so we'll call it a draw that
added audio punch is also appreciated
when gaming where the note 4 keeps up
the family honor we put it through our
trio of high demand games and found
nothing to complain about in terms of
graphics or framerate and just like last
year's note there's not even that much
heat coming off it in stress tests what
we're mainly concerned about with heavy
use like this is battery life and
despite its higher resolution screen and
nearly identical battery capacity as
last year the note 4 seems to keep pace
with its predecessor in this department
the new note also lets you go dimmer on
the display and it brings ultra power
saving mode and much faster charging
taking all that into account the 4 is
probably the one we'd want with us on a
binge browsing session
if you're wondering when we'll talk
about the heart rate sensor and
fingerprint scanner or how the note 4
performs all on its own good news we've
got all that waiting for you in the full
video review up now for this comparison
which generation of note will be a
better fit for you
will depend on whether you're a
pragmatist or someone more fanciful if
it's the former well last year's note
holds up pretty well its screen is still
beautiful and its capabilities still
outstrip most of today's large format
smartphones if you really need to save
money but really want to note the note 3
is still a good purchase
if you're an appreciator of the finer
things though and you have the dead
presidents to spare the note 4 is a
significantly better device it looks
better it feels much better
in every respect and its revised
software is at least an improvement if
not a quantum leap if only a few weeks
worth of saving is the difference
between buying last year's note and this
year's well you're better off being
patient with your pennies because the
note 4 is certainly worth it
