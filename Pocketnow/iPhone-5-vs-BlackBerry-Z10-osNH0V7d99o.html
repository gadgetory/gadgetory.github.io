the iPhone 5 hey guys it's four and a
minimun from pocketnow.com and in this
video we're going to compare both of
these phones let's get to it these
devices look entirely different the
BlackBerry z10 is made for business
while the iPhone 5 is more dainty and
good-looking and also fragile we found
in our durability report that the iPhone
5 is especially susceptible long-term
we're talking three or four months to
scratches dings dents bruises and all
that kind of stuff if you're not using a
case especially this chamfered edge
which is what really makes people fall
in love with the iPhone 5 I think but it
is so susceptible to getting beat up
very very badly
now the z10 is a totally different
device it's made for productivity for
for for life and so it's made out of
entirely plastic whereas the iPhone 5 is
glass and metal and it feels totally
different in hand it feels more solid it
feels like something that's not going to
slip out of your hand and if it does
slip out of your hand
you're not going to cry about it because
this device is more resilient so on the
back here we've got a soft touch plastic
with a nice dimpled texture which just
makes it feel awesome and hand you know
some people say that the z10 looks like
the iPhone 5 well what they really mean
to say so the z10 looks like the back of
the iPhone 5 and it's not that big of
resemblance we have these strips on the
top and the bottom but the differences
really stop there overall the z10 is
nondescript it really isn't a looker but
that's okay I think it's meant for
business it's meant to take away the
distraction of chamfered edges and metal
textures and all that stuff and just
give you a functional device that feels
good in the hand over here on the side
we've got micro USB and the ability to
do and output to an HDMI capable
television or projector got a volume
rocker and BlackBerry's quick actions
button and here at the top is the power
standby button one of the interesting
things that you can do on the z10 that
you can't do on the iPhone 5 is unlock
the display by swiping up from the
bottom now both of these are turned off
right now so it's not going to work but
I'm going to show you that in a sec of
course on the iPhone 5 we've got
everything in its iPhone e place on the
back we've got 8 megapixel cameras on
both capable of doing 1080p video we can
say without question that video and
photos look much much better taken with
the iPhone 5 you can check out our full
z10 review for camera samples if you
want both have an LED flash there in
terms of thickness the z10 is definitely
thicker taller and wider overall the
iPhone 5 is more slender in hand and it
feels smaller and more lightweight
but again the z10 feels like it's ready
for a day of action now before we talk
about specs and boot up a little bit on
availability the BlackBerry z10 will be
available on all four carriers very soon
we're filming this in March and around
March or April it should be available
the iPhone 5 of course is available on
all carriers carriers except for
t-mobile
so let's start these up and see which
gets on first one two three Geronimo
okay and some life has occurred here and
let's see which of these devices turns
on more quickly now in terms of specs
they're kind of similarly SPECT in a way
as mentioned their cameras are the same
they've both got and they both have a
dual-core CPU the BlackBerry z10 has 2
gigs of RAM the iPhone only has 1
gigabyte of RAM on boots onboard storage
that's a funny thing to say is 16
gigabytes on the z10 and your choice of
16 32 or 64 gigabytes on the iPhone 5
but the z10 gives you microSD expansion
it also allows you to swap the battery
ok the iPhone 5 was first the z10 is
going to be second and let's just show
that built for business of course so you
can swap out your battery if you're
doing a cross-country flight you're
watching video you take out the battery
put in a new one and we've got a slot
for a micro SIM card so you can expand
the memory on the z10 okay so we've Jack
brightness up to 100% on both devices to
turn off all the brightness and what you
can tell right away is that the screen
on the z10 is warmer some people like
warmer screens some people don't
it's really up to you now these are very
different screens but they're similarly
sized we've got a 4-inch 11 36 by 640
display here on the iPhone 5 that's 326
PPI the z10 beats the iPhone 5 in terms
of PPI if that's something that you're
looking at with a 1280 by 768 resolution
4.2 inch screen makes for a PPI of 350
five can you tell the difference between
the two in terms of PPI not really
they're both extremely crisp and they
look really really good now software
couldn't be more different on both of
these devices the z10 has the new
BlackBerry 10 operating system which
actually takes some cues from the
iPhones operating system let me show you
what I mean by that so if we swipe to
the right this is the main home screen
if we swipe to the right these are where
your icons live and you can make folders
and stuff on the iPhone of course back
in I don't know 2007 they introduced
this idea of tap and hold and the little
jiggle right watch this tap and hold and
pulsate okay not a jiggle but it's a
pulsate this is definitely inspired by
the iPhone 5 and like you can do on
really all platforms you can tap and
hold an icon drag it on top of another
and you can create a folder and when
you're done you just tap you just tap
but folders are kind of weird on the z10
they are fullscreen they're up in your
face whereas on the iPhone 5 they kind
of just fold down which is a nice touch
okay now let's compare web browsing
always very important here and open up
Safari now to get to the web browser on
the z10 we swipe over to the app pane
here
I've got browser up here at the top so
I'm going to click Safari here and
browser at the same time one two three
boom and got there faster on the iPhone
5 now here on the z10 what you have is
sort of this quick dial interface which
is always nice to see let's go to
pocketnow.com on both and see what's up
we've got the address bar on the bottom
here and here's something interesting
the keyboards are very different between
these two devices it looks so nice on
the z10 it kind of looks like a real
Hardware QWERTY keyboard with these
metal strips in between bit of pocket
now calm here
okay and they're both going not exactly
the same time but we'll do an official
speed test in a sec moving around the
page both of these I can tell you have
very very good web browsers but which is
faster let's say desktop version one two
three go and we're waiting for the
progress bar here and the iPhone 5
finish first and we'll wait for the z10
to finish loading final images and let's
scroll down the page we don't want to
see any white space if we flick quickly
and we don't i phone 5 has a slower way
of scrolling let's pinch to zoom see
which clears up text faster iPhone 5 a
little bit faster the the z10 is having
some problem with Typekit fonts a lot of
websites these days including pocket now
use custom fonts with Adobe Typekit and
it's not converting it Windows Phone 7.5
and 7 have the same problem in Internet
Explorer not that big of a deal but it
makes some websites like the verge and
Engadget and pocket now look a little
bit weird so let's click on a link and
see what it's like to load up this
pocket now daily video that's
fascinating
okay so we've got a video here ready to
go and a video here at a go let's see
which loads up the video first 1 2 3 go
did that work running for the Samsung
Galaxy and there we go 2 videos playing
video is slightly larger here on the z10
of course because it's a larger screen
they both look very good on the z10 it's
definitely a little bit warmer so Jaime
looks more tan than he usually does Hey
look at that that's funny
but both playback video very very
smoothly let's get out of here now if
someone were to ask what's good about
BlackBerry 10 I would say messaging and
this is why the BlackBerry is really
good at messaging something that the
iPhone does not do from any screen by
the way the videos still playing you
swipe up from the bottom if you do it
the right way you swipe up from the
bottom and you begin to see your
notifications in the BlackBerry hub if
you swipe up a little more into the
right you can start to peek into your
into your BlackBerry hub which is where
all of your Twitter and Facebook status
and updates come through and all of your
emails fall into one place and it's a
really awesome way to really see
everything that's going on in your life
and of course if you go over here to the
hub or to the listing before the hub you
can drill into specific areas but from
any screen whether you're on Facebook or
Twitter the New York Times and you just
want to see if you have some messages
and what they're what they're looking
like you just do a little swipe and then
you can swipe back and go back to the
home screen through that multitask
UI but besides that that's really it and
in terms of what makes BlackBerry 10
awesome right now it's sparse in terms
of the app selection and we are trying
to answer the question why the z10
because of course the iPhone 5 has a app
selection that is really second to none
it's still slightly better than what you
get on Android phones today so the z10
is a great phone if you want some rugged
Hardware a great typing experience the
best email experience on any device
great security features and a device to
just get
stuff done but that's not exactly true
because in order to get stuff done you
need apps for everything all of your
stuff and the z10 just does not have it
and right now we cannot recommend the
z10 so if you're comparing against the
iPhone 5 the iPhone 5 is a mature
product that can just do so much more
the z10 has promised make no mistake
about it but right now it's unfulfilled
so which do you think is better which
device would you rather carry as your
daily driver the email friendly
messaging friendly z10 or the more
refined more mature iPhone 5 let us know
in the comments and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
