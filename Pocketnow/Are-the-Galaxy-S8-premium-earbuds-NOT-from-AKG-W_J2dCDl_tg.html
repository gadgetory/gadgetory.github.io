brought to you by D brand clickbait e
title is clickbait e but it would appear
folks that i have misled you
we produced a separate video taking a
look and to listen at the earbuds that
are included with the galaxy s 8 you
know these earbuds here with the giant
AKG logos on them but it turns out these
earbuds were not made by AKG what depths
of journalistic investigation did I have
to descend to to uncover this shocking
fact actually a Samsung PR bro hit me up
on Twitter that's that's tweet right
there after getting that tweet I went
over to Samsung site and looked up their
other headphones and wouldn't you know
it this casing design is actually really
common on Samsung headphones made by
Samsung but tuned by AKG this disclosure
is actually just a little bothersome
it's not like we haven't seen these
kinds of partnerships before see these
earbuds were also tuned by AKG so of
course there's a big AKG logo on the
back no no actually it's an LG logo
because LG made these headphones and
then sought out the audio expertise of
AKG and for the v20 in a lot of markets
which got the B&amp;amp;O headphones these often
just came in via no retail packaging no
confusion there so it's a good thing
Samsung corrected me on this
misconception I wonder where I could
have gotten the idea that these were
from AKG a month ago we announced our
partnership with Harman and today we're
excited to show you one of the first
examples of that collaboration every
galaxy si will come with a pair of
top-of-the-line earbud from AKG from a
kg for her so folks does this change
your opinion on a somewhat expensive
accessory that's included in the box on
a Galaxy s8 for me personally this
doesn't change my assessment from the
review of the audio quality in the
slightest obviously but I can't shake
this little bug of frustration as it
pertains to Samsung in this labeling and
branding exercise so drop a comment down
below share your thoughts we know
Samsung's really pushing this Harman
acquisition do you think they've done
enough to properly disclose the
relationship as it pertains to the
Galaxy s8 and these premium earbuds did
you know that if there are 23 people in
a room there's a 50% chance that two of
them share a birthday we'd like to thank
our sponsor D brand for
reminding us that the next time your mom
forgets your birthday chances are she
