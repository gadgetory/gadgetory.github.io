calm if you can follow in our Android
coverage so that we recently reviewed
the samsung transform on sprint which is
a touchscreen android device with a full
qwerty slide out keyboard well now it's
time to unbox the same type of device
but from entirely different manufacturer
and carrier and that's the motorola
flipside so this video let's go ahead
and unbox it and we're back and we've
already cut the package I've elope open
so you aren't stuck waiting for us to
pull the device out so let's go ahead
and actually take this guy right out and
as you can see here actually going to
zoom in a little closer so you can get a
better view of the box once again this
is the motorola flipside this does
feature the motoblur technology as you
can see right here the box itself will
give us some of the icons it's going to
have the Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G its android 2.1 all
of that fun stuff now of course in the
box you want to have the actual device
itself the battery the charger a 2
gigabyte microSD card which is
pre-installed the Quick Start Guide and
of course we have some of the main
features here now one of the main
features to actually take note of is the
somewhat slower processor it's a 720
megahertz processor however this guy
does have a fairly good amount of RAM
which is actually 512 megabytes so
hopefully that will help make up for the
slower if you will processor spreads out
the box is going to have the Quick Start
guides in the manual ATT is big on the
texting and driving it can wait campaign
is why we see that on top there and of
course we're going to have the which is
a micro USB charger to the usb the wall
adapter which will actually feature the
USB port on the sides you can somewhat
see here that's why you'll actually plug
that cable into the battery which if we
flip this over is an 1150 milliamp hour
battery and then last but not least
we'll have the back of the cover so
let's go ahead and clear this stuff
aside will pop the battery and pop a sim
card in and get this guy booted up
alright we're back and we've now popped
in the battery in the sim card we're
going to go ahead and power the device
up for the very first time let's see
where this takes us
now if you don't know what motoblur is
it is Motorola's custom skin that is
over android for example you have HTC
Sense which is HTC's custom skin that's
one of the great things that
manufacturers like about Android is the
fact that they can skin it however they
see fit now that may not be your
personal preference but like we said
Motorola has incorporated motorola blur
hey which is actually what you're seeing
pop up and we've now fully booted up
it's going to give us a quick start menu
here now it's going to ask you to sign
in with a motoblur account if you do not
have one you can make a new one if you
do have one you can sign in with that
account and we're actually going to run
through that process right now alrighty
we are now fully started up and fully
registered as you'll see here we have
the home screen looks like we have some
quick icons down at the bottom as well
as some pre-determined shortcuts for
some applications swiping to the left
will get a different screen it looks
like we have seven home screens here
which actually correspond to these
sections down here and this is just a
prefilled in widgets as well as
application so that's been a quick look
at the motorola flipside our next video
will actually be a software overview
which will detail motorola blur so you
can actually get a better look at it so
make sure you stay tuned for that video
otherwise as always everyone thank you
for watching like this video please give
it a thumbs up and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
