everything we knew about a smartphone
would change at today's Droid unveiling
in New York City and while that may have
been too tall in order there's still
some pretty compelling stuff here if
you're shopping for a smartphone on
America's largest network I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
first look at the Motorola Droid turbo 2
and Droid Maxx - these phones look a lot
alike but don't let that fool you each
serves a very different buyer segment
what they have in common beyond a
general aesthetic and the fact that both
of our review units are white is an
Android OS very large batteries 21
megapixel cameras and a whole lot of
Verizon bloatware the droid turbo 2 is
very much the flagship offering here
besting the max2 in almost every metric
it packs a Snapdragon 810 processor
alongside three gigs of DDR 4 ram 32 and
64 gig storage options to go alongside
microSD and a 5 point 4 inch display at
quad HD resolution that display
introduces Motorola's new shatter shield
technology which motorola and Verizon
are calling shatterproof it took three
years to develop and comprises a five
layer assembly based on a plastic OLED
panel made it to a separate redundant
touch system and internal and external
lenses there's not a bit of glass in the
whole thing and it's fused to the
phone's aluminum frame the result is a
display that's guaranteed not to crack
or shatter for four years
needless to say that's impressive if the
phone can live up to it power is another
big part of the turbo 2 story it packs a
large 37 60 milliamp hour battery that
verizon says is good for two days of use
last year's original Droid turbo didn't
quite live up to those claims so we'll
see how the sequel does the turbo 2 does
support the new 25 watt turbo charging
as well and in a radical shift from
Verizon precedent the Droid turbo 2
packs both Qi and PM a wireless charging
Motorola has also brought moto maker to
the Droid line for the first time with
the turbo 2 allowing you to choose
between a revised ballistic nylon finish
pebbled whore weaned leather
or a reformulated soft grip coating
along with accent and faceplate colors
and all the other custom elements we've
grown used to in a nice twist on the
custom phone concept if you get tired of
the color scheme you chose and you
bought the 64 gig option you can now
trade in your device at any time during
a two-year period and get a totally
different color scheme it costs four
bucks extra every month but still that's
pretty awesome
rounding out the turbo 2 is the
aforementioned 21 megapixel camera the
full suite of contextual moto features
we like so much and a water-repellent
nano coatings in keeping with its family
heritage
it's a beefy phone and in the hand it
sure feels like it the aluminum frame is
cool to the touch the soft backing
material is grippy without being sticky
and the whole thing bristles with
adornments calling out the active
display sensor ports the front firing
flash front-facing speakers and yeah a
big ole Verizon logo down center the
Droid Maxx - is something different this
is the mid tier offering and as we were
expecting it's essentially a rebranded
Moto X play for the US well it's the
exact same weight as the turbo to the
max - feels substantially lighter
because of its less premium industrial
design which includes a frame that looks
like metal but is actually painted
polycarbonate instead of Moto maker
you've got user changeable silicone
backs here which will be sold separately
by Verizon and Motorola and which add to
the devices in slightly flimsy feel it's
got a rounder less aggressive design
language and more modest specs including
a Snapdragon 615 processor backed up by
2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage
microSD expansion and a five and a half
inch full HD display that display is a
more conventional design it's protected
by Gorilla Glass 3 instead of the
shatter shield stuff and the battery
takes a slight step down to 36 30
milliamp hours as well the turbo
charging is still here but it's 15 watt
instead of 25 watt the camera is the
same 21 megapixel sensor but because of
the down rated processor it can't do 4k
you see where we're going here the max2
is on the high side of the mid-range
certainly but it's still mid-range and
in the hand it certainly feels like it
that stratification is reflected in the
price naturally in a huge way where the
droid turbo 2 starts at 624 off-contract
the droid maxx two starts at just 384 of
course verizon offers multiple payment
options to break those sums up 16 a
month for the max2
and 26 or 30 a month for the turbo 2
both phones go on sale this thursday
online at motorola calm and Verizon's
online and retail channels and Verizon
Wireless is offering up to $300 for
phone trade ends when you pick up one of
these we won't know if either phone is a
good deal until we put them through our
full review process but particularly in
the case of the droid turbo 2 we're
quite excited to do so these may not
change everything we know about smart
phones but they do promise compelling
solutions for a very common complaints
now it's time to figure out how well
each one delivers let us know what you
want to see in our full reviews of the
turbo 2 and Max 2 folks leave a comment
below and follow us on social media
pocket now is AD pocket now and I am at
captain 2 phones until next time this
has been max turbo I mean Michael Fisher
from new york city thanks for watching
we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
