possible refresh coming soon the ipad
mini with retina display has any been
launched yet and they're already talking
about shortages as well and samsung
sells 40 million galaxy s4 devices in
six months I'm hi mera neta and if a
company gives you a thin phone with no
excuses removable storage at a
replaceable battery they deserve their
success this is pocket out daily letters
they off with some more official news
from Microsoft just as yesterday they
decided to keep the surface for another
year they're doing the same with the
surface pro from last year at least
until supplies last you get the 64 gig
model for 699 and the 128 gig model for
799 which is hundred dollars less on the
price tag and it's really good and if
you think about it i mean we actually
recommended this tablet this is a very
good tablet unless you're looking for
better battery life and the new features
of the surface pro 2 this tablet is good
enough for you and it's two hundred
dollars less so keep it in mind now
let's talk about some official news from
samsung as their company CEO JK shin
just came on record to state that the
company had sold 40 million galaxy s4 s
in six months and yes i'm talking just
about the galaxy s4 obviously samsung
ships devices they don't really sell we
don't really know exactly how many
devices are actually sold from carriers
and not on the shelf but still i mean
this is the most popular Android phone
in the market whether you like it or not
and these don't include the sales of the
galaxy note 3 just yet so yeah they're
growing now let's go through some
official news from HTC and no they did
not sell 40 million units but at least
they treat their customers a lot better
when it comes to software updates the
company is on a roll now they have a
version of Android 4.3 for the
international HTC One that also includes
sense 5.5 which debuted on the HTC One
max and this is great I mean if you have
an HTC One international very you can
get it now sadly we don't know what to
expect for the u.s. variants you know
how things go with the carriers but
still it's awesome to see that HTC has
figured out the software game better
than samsung where my old galaxy s3
doesn't have anything compared to the
HTC One X already
now let's talk about Apple as the
company has not even begun selling the
ipad mini with retina display it won't
even be sold on November first of you
don't know it's actually available later
in November no specific dates and
analysts are already predicting that
Apple will have shortages for this
tablet a la gold iphone 5s meaning it's
going to be really bad apparently the
company is only building a third of the
iPad minis that they planned for the
ipad mini launched last year which is
really bad since a lot of us are waiting
for the iPad Mini with Retina display
even though a lot of us are still
choking ourselves with that price tag
and I'm thinking about it still let's
see how it plays we just still don't
have any dates so again these could just
be rumors and finally for the hot news
of the day another company that's
experiencing shortages but actually good
ones is Google with their Nexus 10 this
could mean that the tablet is finally do
for a refresh which is a very do refresh
since the Nexus 10 wasn't really as
popular as Google expected it to be and
apparently this new one will be in a
sous made tablet that's kind of been
leaked out there this has probably been
the worst leaked tablet ever we don't
really know much about it we've only
seen one render and it looks very
Photoshop that's a portrait of shoes
tablet and let's just see what to make
of that but still you know that leads me
to the question of the day are you
looking forward to a nexus 10 refresh
it's something that you're looking for
because in my particular case you know
the Nexus 10 had great specifications it
was a beautiful tablet but honestly the
nexus 7 killed it for me I like the
Nexus 7 a lot more I consider it to be
more convenient so leave us a comment
down below are you waiting for the nexus
10 or are you going for the nexus 7 now
