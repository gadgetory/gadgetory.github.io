you some very very cool custom roms that
you can apply to your Android powered
smartphones and tablets but what happens
after you've tried them and you decide
that they may not be for you or you want
to revert your device back to stock I'm
Joe Levi for PocketNow and this is how
to restore your Google Nexus to factory
stock condition next thing you're going
to need to do is head over to this
website I'll have a link to it at
pocketnow.com so you can just click and
get there quickly you're then going to
need to find your device in this list
mine happens to be a nexus 7 Wi-Fi that
we're going to show you today and I have
two choices either Android 4.1.2 or
4.2.1 I want to go with the latest
version 4.2.1 that's the latest version
of jellybean though if you think it's a
little laggy or like the previous
version you can flash back very easily
if you want it to do that go ahead and
click find your link to download it is
relatively large we're talking close to
300 megabytes so download and go get
yourself a drink next you're going to
need a program that can uncompress our
downloaded file it's in a tgz format so
the the app that I like is called WinRAR
it's free I'll have a link to where you
can download that over in the article as
well next if you don't already have it
you're going to need to download at the
Android SDK or a slimmed down version
that has fastboot and ADB and all the
required tools so that you can hook your
device up to your computer to get the
Android SDK I'll give you a link also in
the article once the Android SDK is
installed you'll have a platform tools
or a platform directory depending on the
version and what platform you're using
to install all of these tools upon it
looks something like this what I'm going
to do now is just copy all of my Naga
see I think I said that wrong last time
although getting this ugh I'm not even
going to try all the Nexus 7 files over
into this folder and yes I do need to
have administrative privileges so I'm
going to continue this time I'm going to
say yes to all items because there's
half a dozen or so close that folder and
now I've got everything over here that I
need this is where things get easy
you need to reboot your device into
fastboot mode the way I've done that is
held down the volume up and down button
when the device was off and press and
hold the power button until it comes up
to mass boot you can tell cuz it says so
right there next and of course I've got
this hooked up to the computer next I'm
going to change into this folder using
Windows 7 or Windows 8 you can just
highlight that line copy it come over
here and type in CD for change directory
right click paste and enter and there
you go I was already there but that's
the fast way to do it clean that up
the next thing this is where it's all
easy we want to flash all simple simple
flash all now if you are on Linux or on
Mac it's going to be a little bit
different you'll want to follow the
instructions again I'll have a link to
those instructions at the article but
you can see from here it's going ahead
and flashing and erasing and erasing and
flashing everything is going to be
replaced it's going to be all back to
factory stock except it's still going to
be unlocked now over on my device it's
gone ahead and rebooted and you can tell
here I've now got that mounted as a
device looking at it you can also see I
am now at my welcome screen this is
still not Om locked if you want to OEM
lock it you need to reboot into fastboot
mode again and run another command which
I'll have for you over in the article at
pocketnow.com so there you go you can
now quickly and easily restore your
Nexus device back to factory image and
even om lock it again so that you can
resell it so that you can give it to a
family member so you can send it in for
warranty repair whatever the case may be

thumbs up why not tell your friends

Google+ page as well for Pocket nail

you may have dug yourself into with
custom roms I'm Joe Levi thanks for
