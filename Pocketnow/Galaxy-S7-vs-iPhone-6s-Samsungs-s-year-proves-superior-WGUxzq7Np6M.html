have asked for Apple's latest and
greatest iPhone versus the new galaxy on
the block
I'm hi Mary vana with pocket now live
from MWC 2016 and Barcelona here with a
quick show floor comparison between the
samsung galaxy s7 and the iphone 6s
brought to you by deep brand we've
always known that the S year for any
iPhone involves better specifications on
the same hardware and at simple glance
you'd think that Samsung did the same
here still where the iPhone success is
indistinguishable when compared to the
iPhone 6 in hardware and design
Samsung's approach to reiteration was
actually different in the hand it's
really hard to say that anything has
changed on either of these devices but
the story is rather different once you
dig deeper for starters Samsung actually
worked on perfecting its already popular
galaxy s6 design in ways that Apple
really didn't the galaxy s7 sports a
more ergonomic and curved design when
compared to its predecessor while the
iPhone 6s just adopted the 7000 series
aluminum that Samsung launched pretty
much a year ago
Samsung also took a step forward and
made this an ip68 water in this
resistant device by treating its
internals while the iPhone success is
reportedly also water resistant though
not officially the display on the galaxy
s7 continues to be the gorgeous AMOLED
panel of its predecessor but now with
the added benefit of an always-on mode
that's smart enough to detect of your
phone is in the pocket or place facedown
and where the iPhones IPS panel just
follows the good but unremarkable path
of its predecessor surely Apple has
brought its new 3d touch
pressure-sensitive display here
something that can be rather useful in
certain scenarios and where Samsung's
Galaxy s7 was only rumored to include
pressure sensitivity but really didn't
deliver still Samsung also added some
major improvements with the purpose of
addressing consumer complaints while
Apple brought features that some people
didn't really ask for
for example the Samsung Galaxy s7 now
comes an only one 32 gigabyte
configuration that's
complemented by expandable storage
through an extended SIM tray and were
sadly any iPhone success starts at 16
gigs and adding storage is a lot more
money
Samsung also added a much larger 3000
milliamp hour battery to the galaxy s7
as opposed to Apple's decision to shave
a few hundred milli amp hours on its
flagship just to accommodate that new
vibrating motor Samsung touts that its
new battery will allow you to watch a
full season of Game of Thrones with one
charge but I'll have to see and test
that to believe it Apple instead decided
to acknowledge how bad its iPhone 6s
battery is by launching this horrible
case with an extended battery for those
in need during Samsung's presentation
the company spent a great deal of time
showing us how its camera is far
superior to that of the iPhone 6s though
this is something we already considered
as true even with last year's galaxy's
matte set Samsung showed us how it
shaved the camera hump on its new galaxy
s7 and brought a brighter lens with F
1.7 aperture in addition to 30% larger
pixels in order to let in more light
even if that was at the expense of a new
13 megapixel sensor when compared to
last year 16 megapixel sensor in the
case of the iPhone 6s the camera hunt
continues to be just as horrible as its
predecessor while performance is very
good though not as great as even the
galaxy s6 from last year the galaxy s7
now includes faster focusing by using
dual pixel technology which pretty much
takes advantage of all the pixels of the
sensor in order to be able to focus
faster whereas the iPhone is touted to
only use a certain amount of these and
resulting in slower focus and Samsung
tried to even prove that in a video and
then the story with the internals is
still of disparity between the Exynos
88-90 and apple's a 9 and the same can
be said about the 4 gigs of ram
respectively while Apple barely
scratches the surface in sheer numbers
still you have to remember that we won't
really be able to confirm which phone is
faster until we actually bring it to the
pocket now labs for a full review in a
month or so bottom line while the galaxy
s7 follows on many of the design choices
of its predecessor this is
a more superior phone and where people
still debate that they could say the
same about last year's iPhone 6's okay
