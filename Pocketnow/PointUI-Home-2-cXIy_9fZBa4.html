hey everyone Daniel Webster here at
paquim√© calm and today I'm going to
show you a new panel for the sony
ericsson xperia x1 called home to buy
point you I and i'll post a link on
parking our comments to how to get this
okay so the first thing you'll notice is
this interface is pretty colorful and
you'll see the time and the date as well
as the weather forecast the current
weather as well as the high of the low
and a graphic that indicates what the
weather is like outside and this is by
accuweather com and click on this and
select cities there's not too many
cities to choose from it's mainly most
major cities around the world we can go
back okay and this next tab over here is
for tomorrow it's the same thing shows
appointments and your your weather for
tomorrow and below this we have a google
news ticker that will show you the
current news around the world and below
this we have applets that you can add
different ones to or you can have a
slide show as well as the world will go
to the world and show you that and i'll
show you what a graphic of the world and
give you the time of the city that you
can select in there as well okay so the
next one we can do is call history i'm
not going to click that because i don't
think my friends and family want all
their phone numbers broadcast on the
internet okay this one right here is
actually programs and this this
interface allows you to add up to 12
different programs the cool thing about
this is watch you can move them around
so you can select whichever ones you
want to be at the highest priority
whichever ones you want to be the lowest
priority so you can also delete them
select whichever ones you want from your
programs list so we can go back next
thing we have is context and this will
allow you to add up 12 different context
and the same thing like the programs you
can move them around and if you want
your best friend to be first then you
got them up there okay so then you can
also delete them as well oh and down
here is all contacts I'll show you that
in just a second so go back okay here's
our messaging wait for that to load and
it doesn't really load anything too
spectacular just the windows mobile
Terry messaging things so you can just
go back out of that but it is nice that
is there's a button right there to use
ok so right here's menu and this allows
you to see running programs and I have
contacts and activesync running so you
can go back and this will show all of
your programs and it's a touch scroll
interface and it works very well with
finger or stylus so we can go back and
now settings it's pretty basic it does
have all your personal settings but the
the connections are pretty basic it's
not as good as going up just starting
down to settings so I'll go back okay
and if you can see this little point you
I graphic down here if you click on this
it actually brings us to their blog
community documents gear whatever if you
want to buy something I guess and it
also shows this this home to pro so it
says coming soon won't click on that
because it was load up Internet Explorer
so we'll go back and down here it also
is a a band a reception bar as well as
battery life and right here is contacts
and this is the same flip scroll thing
you can just go to your contacts okay
and that's a point you is home to and
it's also available on any windows
mobile device and it works on landscape
as well any device that has qvga wqvga
vga and wvga and you i'll post a link on
Park geun-hye calm hats how to get that
this is daniel webster Park geun-hye
