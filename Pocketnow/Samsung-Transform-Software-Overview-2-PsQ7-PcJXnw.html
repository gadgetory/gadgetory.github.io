now calm and it's time for a test in
this video of our software overview part
2 we're going to pit the samsung
transform against its big brother the
samsung epic 4g going to run a browser
test check out youtube look at the
screens the overall brightness that sort
of thing so let's get started and we're
back and actually jumping directly into
the youtube test one thing to notice
here is actually the keyboard difference
between the samsung transform in the
samsung epic 4g or lack thereof there's
actually no difference in the keyboard
at all besides some of the size simply
because of the 3.5 inch screen that the
samsung transform has now we've actually
already typed in the pocket now videos
we can pull up the channel so we're
going to do that now these are on the
same exact Wi-Fi network with nothing
running in the backgrounds are actually
fresh boots on both of these so it
definitely pulled up faster on the
samsung epic 4g now we're going to
actually pull up the top video which is
a windows phone 7 comparison video i'll
turn these side by side now there was
the difference i wouldn't say it was a
deal breaker difference but that
definitely showcases the different
processor that the epic 4g has once
again though the transform is 800
megahertz processor which is by no means
last generation or left in the dust one
great element about the samsung
transform is that it actually does not
include the samsung touchwiz UI now if
you use TouchWiz in the past it's either
you like it or you hate it there's no in
the middle with this now I just see here
the epic 4g has touched with so if you
actually go to the applications menu it
actually will scroll left and right and
it's very people call it kitty looking
it's very almost iphone asked in terms
of the actual icons as you see here now
the home screen does give you your seven
different home screens as you see here
left and right the ball will actually
change at the top so you have the seven
home screens here now the samsung
transform does not have the samsung
touchwiz UI it actually uses the Sprint
ID so it's not going to give you that
iphone ask childlike appearance as you
bring up the typical menu drawer it
actually looks very similar to froyo of
course
nottis is android 2.1 but it does look
similar so you'll have your typical
appearance here of your normal android
apps and you will have the five home
screens one being in the middle two to
your right and then two to your left if
you so choose to use those now one of
the last software comparisons we're
going to do between the samsung
transform in the epic 4g is going to be
a browser test so actually going to
bring up pocketnow com this of course
something we like to do a lot this will
showcase the speed of the processor when
it's actually able to load a desktop
version of a website so we already have
them both queued up and you'll see the
epic 4g did load at first it's actually
not fully loaded yet it's actually still
rendering now the transform hangs a
little bit here there we go so actually
if you look at these two status bars
they were actually almost identical
where they were they set but it has to
load the actual banner ad in that sort
of thing and that's where really what's
loading right now in the samsung
transform but you you can still scroll
here so it's not going to be a bad
experience there at all once again it's
still at 800 megahertz processor but
it's still a fast processor it's by no
means slow so it does somewhat keep up
with the epic 4g all right so now we've
loaded the full website we can actually
pinch to zoom here so we'll actually
pick this up and we'll show you how how
smooth that is or not smooth depends on
your personal opinion so it's not going
to be smooth like butter one hundred
percent however it's very very easy to
still browse we can actually pick this
article here and you'll see it's
actually going to open up the page for
us so there's been a quick look at the
browser on the samsung transform the
next and final video in this series will
actually be our final thoughts on the
samsung transform so be sure to stay
tuned for the final review if you've
enjoyed this video please leave us a
thumbs up or a comment thanks for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
