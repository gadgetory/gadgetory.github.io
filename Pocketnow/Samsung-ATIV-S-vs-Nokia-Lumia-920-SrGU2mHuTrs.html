but it's finally here
Samsung's new Windows Phone is just now
starting to trickle onto retail shelves
though where one of its primary
competitors the Nokia Lumia 920 has
already had several weeks to gain some
traction
how does Samsung's offering stack up
against its Nokia competition let's find
out I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is Samsung at Eve s versus
Nokia Lumia 920 here on the demo table
we've got the global version of the atif
s which we just unboxed yesterday
alongside the AT&amp;amp;T version of the Lumia
920 we're gonna compare them in five
categories specs display build camera
and software in that order on the spec
side there are actually significant
differences between these devices even
though they're both very high-end
smartphones their hearts are in the same
place though almost every Windows Phone
8 device we've reviewed so far has been
powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 dual-core CPU running at 1.5
gigahertz and backed up by a gig of ram
and that holds true for each of these
there's also up to 32 gigs of storage
out of the box depending on which at Eve
S version you choose after those basics
though the differences start piling up
rather quickly
the nokia device brings the obvious
differentiation in terms of its eight
point seven megapixel PureView primary
camera whereas Samsung sticks with a
more conventional 8 megapixel shooter
more importantly the ative s features a
removable back cover and a removable
2300 milliamp hour battery as well as a
micro SD card slot with micro SDXC
support or extended capacity beyond 32
gigs of additional storage
we don't have battery performance
results from the achieve s yet but early
impressions are favorable more specifics
coming in the full review the Lumia 920
features none of this it's 2,000
milliamp hour battery and 32 gigs of
on-board storage are embedded and
unchangeable our AT&amp;amp;T version here adds
LTE support but that won't be true for
purchasers and some other countries
which implementation you favor will
depend on your usage habits but in terms
of
and power there's no question that the
achieve s is the more modular and
adaptable of these two devices these two
devices diverged significantly in terms
of display technology the Lumia 920
features a 4.5 inch 1280 by 768 TFT LCD
with Nokia's usual slew of branded
features as well as a polarization
filter incorporated partially to deepen
the black levels that same filter also
reduces the viewing angles significantly
good for security on airplanes or trains
when you don't want your neighbours
spying on you bad for sharing with
friends this panel has a pixel density
of 332 PPI the atif s features a larger
4.8 inch panel the biggest we've yet
seen on a wide release Windows Phone 8
device this is a Super AMOLED display
that takes the resolution down slightly
to 1280 by 720 and the pixel density
down to 306 PPI what's all that mean
well the same thing it usually does when
comparing these technologies color
saturation will be higher and blacks
will be deeper on the 'ti of s a
combination which really makes Windows
Phone pop very nicely and that's
especially evident on Samsung's larger
panel when viewing photos or video
though sticklers for authenticity might
prefer the Lumia 920's more authentic
color reproduction and when scrolling
around the OS Nokia's pure motion HD
plus technology might give the
appearance of more smoothness any way
you slice it though we're comparing
apples and oranges here it boils down to
a simple question of user preference the
starkest contrast between these
smartphones is in their physical design
broadly speaking the Lumia 920 is a
thick and heavy device at ten point
seven millimeters and 185 grams and
those substantial proportions really
stand out when you're holding the Atif s
at eight point seven millimeters and 135
grams in your other hand depending on
which color Lumia you buy it's
polycarbonate is either glossy or matte
either way it's unapologetically plastic
in a very high-quality way by contrast
the achieve s masks its plastic
construction
folk chrome on the bezel and a hairline
metallic finish on the back that does a
better job of looking like real metal
than anything Samsung's done before
overall the Lumia feels like the
higher-end device to us not just because
it's heavier but because it's unique
design gives it a subtle refinement
unlike anything else on the market it
aspires to be as the old tagline goes
beautifully different while the achieve
s is a very attractive device in its own
right that fake brushed metal really is
striking its design is comparatively
quite generic if you ignore the Windows
logos on the casing the atif S with the
screen off could be any Samsung
smartphone at a first glance next to the
more aspirational Nokia design it makes
a comparatively dull impression and
overall from the somewhat mushy buttons
to the lack of wireless charging support
out of the box it's a less impressive
device from a build perspective
we've only had a short time to compare
shots between the two cameras and we'll
have more thoughts as well as video in
our full review the early results
shouldn't be too big a surprise though
while the achieve s delivers good photos
the low-light enhancement of the Lumia
920 can't be beaten that's not so much a
dig against the achieve s as an
acknowledgment that the Lumia 920's
camera handily schools almost every
other smartphone shooter in low-light in
more moderate light the 920 suffered
from some softness something we're
expecting an impending software update
to correct
while the atif s delivered sharp warm
results
while windows phone looks and behaves
almost identically across all varieties
of hardware there are some significant
differences in bundled software between
these models the only baseline
difference is one that all windows
phones should incorporate soon the Atif
s came to our door boasting a newer
build of the OS offering support for
Wi-Fi on in standby more importantly
since the atif s is a samsung device it
offers samsung's suite of custom apps
like now chat on music hub and so on
well we found some of these apps useful
the now hub is a nice news and weather
aggregator and the lockscreen wallpaper
shuffler called live wallpaper makes for
fun variety the samsung software suite
doesn't hold a candle to the nokia
collection on the Lumia 920 which offers
robust GPS apps like Nokia city lens and
Nokia Drive as well as a host of special
titles to enhance the 920's camera
functionality nothing against Samsung's
mini diary or family story or its own
fully featured photo editor which is
quite nice but Nokia continues to hold
the edge in terms of specialized apps
for those who like raw numbers the
devices scored a near tie according to
the WP bench utility with the achieve s
delivering at two 37.86 result and the
Lumia 920 scoring two 33.5 those
neck-and-neck scores are borne out in
real world experience too with app
launch times being effectively identical
and browser comparisons showing nearly
identical loading zooming and re
rendering performance in all from a
software perspective once again Windows
Phone is Windows Phone running
consistently well on both devices
but while Samsung brings some
interesting apps to the atif s
experience it's still outclassed by
Microsoft's preferred partner Nokia with
its large collection of enhancements
from one perspective the Samsung ativ s
brings a 2011 sensibility to a 2012
Windows Phone lineup it's looks are more
conventional it's camera is good but
nothing really special and Samsung's
relatively unremarkable custom software
doesn't really help it stand
either but the ateva does feature a
larger display with wider viewing angles
a removable battery and expandable
memory and its looks might be a little
conservative but that's perfect for
someone not trying to make a splash the
faux metal accents really make it shine
which one you choose will depend on what
your needs are if a close to stock
Windows Phone 8 experience is enough for
you and you want expandability and
modularity with a classic look and a big
screen the ative s is your ride if
you're looking for a more robust custom
app offering one of the best smartphone
cameras in the business and build
quality that tops almost anything else
and you don't mind being locked into an
embedded battery and non removable
storage the Lumia 920 is probably more
your speed from what we've seen so far
either way you go you'll be getting a
very refined Windows Phone 8 experience
