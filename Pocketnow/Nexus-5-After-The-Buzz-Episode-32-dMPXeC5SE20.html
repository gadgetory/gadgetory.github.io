new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all on to the next
big thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a look at a phone
months after its release when it's not
shiny and new anymore I'm Taylor Martin
with pocket now this is the google nexus
5 and this is episode 32 of after the
buzz obsolescence is mostly what we look
at with the after the buzz series has a
phone fared well against the test of
time do its specs still compared with
the latest and greatest but this
particular episode is different due to
one key differentiator a single brand
name Nexus the Nexus 5 from the very
start was built with legs mainly because
it's one of the very few smartphones on
the market that appeals to the nerdiest
of nerds and the Android purists who
want the unadulterated google experience
on the phone but software and name
aren't the only thing playing to the
Nexus 5's advantage price is a very firm
bullet point that solidifies the Nexus 5
spot near the top of the charts do these
things still uphold the Nexus 5's
viability let's find out
the design of the Nexus 5 was never a
problem with most sure it's understated
and doesn't try to be anything more than
it actually is a powerful yet affordable
smartphone to adhere to the latter
aspect costs had to be cut somewhere and
design and hardware was ultimately the
only place to do that the phone is still
very attractive in its own right the all
black model two-toned glossy black and
matte white stormtrooper addition as
marques brownlee calls it and the bright
red model are all very distinguished
thanks to the large camera cut out
around back colored earpiece speaker and
of course the Nexus branding but there
isn't anything particularly amazing or
impressive about the design we're okay
with that for a number of reasons mainly
its internals have managed to stay
relatively current in the five months
it's been around the chipset inside is a
Snapdragon 800 with a quad-core krait
400 CPU clocked at two point three
gigahertz and it also has the standard
Adreno 330 GPU it has two gigabytes of
RAM either 16 or 32 gigabytes of fixed
storage and an eight megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization the
2300 milliamp hour battery is as
mediocre as it sounds and the rest is
pretty standard Wi-Fi AC NFC LTE Qi
wireless charging and Bluetooth 4.0 the
4.95 inch to HD IPS plus display is also
a bit sterile the 1080p resolution is
great making an overall density of 445
pixels per inch but where it suffers is
muted color reproduction and black
levels truthfully it's actually more
accurate than a lot of other displays
but we've been trained as consumers to
lust over excessively saturated tones
the contrast levels are a tad low and
viewing angles could be better but if
you consider the price it's really
difficult to complain about the display
in short the specs are still on point
and it's certainly not the worst looking
phone around display or design of course
it doesn't feel all that great in the
hand either but this isn't a seven
hundred dollar smartphone it's half that
price All Things Considered it's still a
great value from the hardware
perspective the software side of things
that has actually improved and as per
usual it's a high point for an excess in
Google Play edition devices the phone
originally launched with the core
version of KitKat android for net for 20
which came with a bevy of newer tiny
features like printing support emergent
mode native emoji support SMS
integration with hangouts and a yellow
pages like dialer
some of those things took some time to
get used to like the business search
function within the dialer and some we
still haven't used today like wireless
printing but they're all nice features
to have at your disposal anyway also at
the time of its launched the Nexus 5 had
a unique launcher and Google Play
experience entirely to itself the Google
now launcher which replaced the leftmost
home screen with google now this too
took some getting used to especially the
large icons but it didn't take us long
to fall in love with the launcher built
around one of our favorite Google
services unfortunately it's no longer
specific to the Nexus 5 but available on
most Nexus and Google Play edition
hardware the Nexus 5 has since been
updated twice and now sits at 44 tattoo
while the next version is rumored to be
in testing the first update was
primarily a camera fix which we'll get
to in a bit the most recent update
brought some bug fixes some better
stability and some more camera
improvements the software is still one
of the biggest draws for the Nexus 5
especially for hardcore enthusiasts if
you're after a bare-bones no-nonsense
software experience the Nexus 5 should
still be near the top of your list
alongside the many Google Play edition
devices part of that pure Android
experience is the full effect of project
butter the phone still runs incredibly
smoothly everything from opening apps
entering or exiting the app drawer and
scrolling is snappy and fluid pair that
with the raw horsepower of the
Snapdragon 800 and this phone will
reform with the best of the best and
gaming media playback multitasking and
pretty much anything else you can throw
at it this phone was built with
enthusiasts and power users in mind it's
designed to handle a heavy workload
unless you're talking stamina battery
life has never been the Nexus 5 strong
suit it still isn't in Michaels initial
review he was able to typically last an
entire day on a single charge but that
also meant crawling in on fumes towards
the end of the day little has changed
since our first experience with the
Nexus 5 a 2,300 milliamp hour battery
just doesn't do this home justice call
quality like before is still rather
impressive and we've been running on
t-mobile's LTE network here in the
Charlotte metro area for the last few
days as expected we aren't complaining
about the double-digit speeds we've
peaked around 14 and a half megabits per
second down and four megabits per second
up
with all the camera software updates
it's hard to say the camera hasn't
improved much it has color reproduction
seems to be more accurate and vibrant
and pictures overall more lively the
biggest improvements were brought to
actual image capture snuffing out the
shutter lag capture now happens in an
instant but while the best picture is
taken with the Nexus 5 are likely to be
better than when it first launched its
still pretty hit or miss especially in
low light despite the optical image
stabilization images are more vibrant
than before even if they sometimes err
on the cool side point being it's far
from the worst camera ever but it still
isn't the absolute best it's about par
for the course in Android land so what's
the verdict the Nexus 5 is just as great
as it was when it launched in November
if not marginally better that's due in
part to the nature of the name of the
device rapid software updates and fixes
for the camera software throw in the
fact that the price starts at just three
hundred and forty nine dollars sans
contract it's hard not to recommend this
phone to someone looking for a bargain
it's not exactly the best deal anymore
thanks to devices like the Moto G but in
terms of value what you get for 350 or
400 dollars you honestly can't ask for
more than what the Nexus 5 offers and
that's why we're still just as enamored
with the Nexus 5 today as we were five
months ago or maybe it's just because it
speaks to our inner nerd either way it's
a killer smartphone for the price and if
you're looking for raw horsepower for
not a lot of money this is the phone you
should buy the visceral google
experience is just icing on the cake
