today I've got the software review of
the HTC Wildfire s by t-mobile this time
it's going to be great all right so I
said this time it's going to be great
what do I mean by that well this guy has
a different screen than a lot of phones
that I've looked at in the past it's
really nice in hand it looks really
pretty good there are a couple caveats
to it that will get to a little bit
later in the video but for some reason
this little camera is well camera shy
and I know this is a phone but a lot of
people are going to use this as their
point and click camera and they're all
around multimedia device it's just a
little bit ironic that it's so difficult
to catch this guy on film and make it
look anywhere halfway decent I don't
know exactly why that is but let's go
into some some of the caveats of this
screen now first of all it's a little
bit smaller and when I say smaller I
mean dimensionally this guy is really
small we talked about that in the
previous video in the hardware video so
if you haven't watched that make sure
you go back in the channel and check
that out this is only 3.2 inches and the
resolution on it isn't all that great
it's 320 x 480 and it's got 262,000
colors on it now that's part of the
issue let me lift this guy up a little
closer to the camera I don't know if you
can see it but there appears to be
banding on on the display and when I say
banding I don't mean traditional banding
like less colors so you have striping
and whatnot of the colors where it goes
from one color to another color without
a nice transition in between no I don't
mean that in fact that's really pretty
good what I mean is there appeared to be
little interlaced lines going through it
that kind of cut the resolution in a
little bit lower maybe even in half why
that is I don't know I think it's just a
characteristic of the screen but it is
something you need to kind of be aware
of and know that it's okay that's what
it's supposed to do it's a lower end
with a lower end display and that's one
of the things that they did too well to
make it less expensive now that having
been said look at this guy you hold it
in your hand just like this reflections
notwithstanding and it's perfect if it's
really nicely it's really really
comfortable this is one of the best
all-around phones to hold in your hand
and it's really a good entry-level phone
now I'm a power user so i really like
power devices and with those power
devices usually come big bulky blocks
like my g2 we've shown you this in the
previous video but just to do a little
side by side I'm paying that's a big
comparison then I zoomed in deliberately
so that the g2 wouldn't all fit on
screen but you kind of get the point but
let's get back into software first of
all what does this guy come prepackaged
with well it's android 2.3 so not the
latest version but still pretty good it
also comes prepackaged with HTC senses
HTC Sense version 2.1 not the 3d version
like the evo 3d and some of the other
phones out there have this is just the
standard 2d and it is version 2.1 not
three not 35 but 2.1 why did they do
that well this guy has a 600 megahertz
processor in it and we'll see some of
those in the benchmarks a little bit
later to see how that impacts it so
let's see what it comes it pre-installed
with if I can scroll down here that's
the radio app okay so first of all
you'll notice my little scroll bar over
on the side says that I'm about a third
of the way down the screen now one of
the things I really like about HTC Sense
UI is the fact that it's got a paginate
'add app drawer so I can look at one
page and then another page and then
another page just like that so I'm not
scrolling between an infinite list of
stuff kind of nice I really like that
it's nothing new so let's go ahead and
just look at what it comes with this is
a tmobile device so it's got some t
mobile apps pre-loaded on it not an
awful lot it's also an HTC Sense device
so it's got some HTC Sense stuff
pre-loaded
again not enough a lot we've got 4 11
and more which is t-mobile's 4 11 and
information app lets you get all kinds
of stuff directory assistance whether
horoscope sports and of course it's paid
by ads let's go back adobe reader comes
pre-installed it's got the nice HTC
calculator with the nice big buttons on
it can come in very handy at times the
HTC calendar HTC camcorder and camera
which are very very functional very nice
the HTC clock app which has your alarms
and whatnot download manager which is
coming more and more standard on more
devices dt sync now this is double twist
syncs up your iTunes library and whatnot
so kind of nice sometimes you have
problems with that where itunes kind of
blocks stuff like that from happening I
don't have an itunes device so I haven't
tried that app out but we'd like to know
your comments leave that down in the
comments down below if you think that
that's a good addition bad addition if
you have any any good experiences are
bad experience with it we kind of showed
you the FM radio now this is just what
it sounds like it is literally an FM
receiver in your phone you do have to
have your headphones plugged in up here
that serves as the antenna to receive
those radio stations and then you can
come down here and just very easily scan
through the stations of course I can't
do that because i don't have the
headphone antenna plugged in but if you
want to get some regular analog radio
signals over the air you can do that
very easily with the FM radio very nice
friend stream that's HTC's unified
facebook and twitter aggregator shows
you what all your friends are talking
about all in one the gallery is very
simply the HTC gallery gmail google
search you know what all that is the HTC
hub kind of the the center of all things
HTC and you can see i haven't set that
back up for this version of the video
HTC likes thats well the stuff that HTC
likes some recommended apps and whatnot
internet is your browser it's the
the HTC version of the browser so it
looks very HTC ish latitude I don't
remember that came on the phone or if I
installed that later but it's a google
app to help share your location with
your friends linpack pro is a
benchmarking utility that i installed
we'll get to that male is the HTC email
client maps as google maps market you
know that messages is the messaging
client again the HTC version of that
music is the HTC music player my account
and my device these are both from
t-mobile they help you get more
information about your device and your
account including minutes used and all
of that fun stuff navigation goes along
with latitude in maps it's the google
gps app news is kind of fun it's
basically just an RSS aggregator for HTC
sense this actually ties in with the web
browser pretty well and lets you get RSS
feeds through the browser which you
don't normally have by default on a
stock android device peep is HTC's
twitter utility the their twitter app if
you will people is the contacts app
phone the phone app places is yet
another one of the google maps things
that helps you find stuff locally based
on either location you input or your gps
location so that's really nice quadrant
is another benchmarking tool we'll get
to that settings and set up kind of go
hand in hand these are all the settings
after the fact this is the setup that
walks you through all of that all right
picking back up we've got slacker which
is a streaming radio station really kind
of cool very similar to pandora with a
lot of different features that i'm sure
if i said it's like pandora i'd get a
lot of hate mail down in the comments so
no it's not like pandora it's like
pandora smart bench and speed tests or
more benchmarking utilities again we'll
get to that t-mobile mail is our
t-mobile mall rather is well the apps
that t-mobile wants you to get make sure
i'm telling you the truth there on that
one yet we all agree to that yes we know
okay already yeah kind of a pain in the
neck so this is
not really the tmobile android market
but kind of it is it lets you get
ringtones caller tunes apps games all
kinds of stuff really has kind of a neat
interface I kind of like this over the
stock android market just saying but
anyway one of the cool things that it
comes with talk is google talk for
chatting and whatnot someday they're
going to integrate audio and video on
all phones and not just the nexus s
family let's hope transfer is a utility
that lets you transfer stuff from your
old phone to your new one once you've
got an android-powered device you really
don't need that anymore but that's going
from like a non-smartphone over to to
this one visual voicemail is t mobile's
version of google voice it tries to
transpose your voice messages and
whatnot google voice is something that i
added on of course because i use google
voice voice search is a google voice
search app utility it kind of enhances
things so you can do more fun stuff with
your search button down here searching
with your voice weather is the weather
app youtube is the youtube app Wi-Fi
calling like you see right up here is a
tmobile thing that lets you make and
receive calls over Wi-Fi when you're
under Wi-Fi bubble now this includes
t-mobile bubbles it includes work
bubbles that includes your home Wi-Fi
bubble that includes your your dorm all
that fun stuff if you don't get good
reception in one of those places not a
problem now whenever you're under that
bubble you're good to go it's a very
simple app you simply have there's a
tutorial there that we're just going to
try and skip however we can skip it
you've got a button down here on and off
so right now it's on it sees what
network I'm connected to and
everything's great now the downside to
this is you do have to have your Wi-Fi
turned on all the time if you want to
receive calls over Wi-Fi when the screen
is off making calls is no problem
because your screen is going to be on
for that but if you want to receive
incoming calls you've got to have Wi-Fi
on and that kind of drains your battery
so those of you who said do reviews with
a full battery I'd like to but it kind
of sucked the battery
because I got Wi-Fi calling on now you
can disable that feature in the Wi-Fi
setup so it's not going to be sucking
down battery all the time just when the
screen is on which is what I have it set
to of course that means i'm not going to
receive calls unless I'm under the the
cellular network which I am here and in
which case it's going to come over the
cellular network now the first thing
you're going to notice this is a 600
megahertz processor inside of here as
far as processors ago it's not that fast
but scrolling between screens even with
the sense UI and the animations really
is nice it's fluid the animations are
quick it looks good it's really an all
around good phone now where you'll run
into some problems let me see if I can
get these specs for you and we talked
about them in the hardware review the
the RAM that is on this phone and the
the hard drive space if you will the
internal storage are both really really
limited so limited in fact that they
don't go over them on their spec sheet
they really don't want you to know so
not a lot we're talking and you know
half gig tops we'll get into specifics
in the right up over at pocketnow.com so
make sure you go and look at that what
that means is when i sync this up with
my account and it started pulling down
all of the apps for me I ran out of
space really really quick because it
filled up the internal memory and and
that was it so I had to get rid of a
whole bunch of stuff this is a
relatively fresh install that I've been
using for the last several days so let's
go ahead and run a couple tests first
we're going to run speed test now this
is connected to my Wi-Fi it is 802 11 n
go ahead and begin that test for you so
you can see it we're going really quick
here so really not too bad on my g2 I
tested it just this morning I was above
10 megabit per second down and above
three megabit per second up so this is
performing pretty well you know not all
that great but 6.4 kilobits per second
down and for kill or megabits rather and
for megabits per second up with a really
lo ping time so that is really not too
bad this is like I said an 802 11 and it
also does BMG it does not do a let's go
ahead and go back and run this again
over if I can get into my settings here
we'll do this again over the cellular
network so we'll turn off Wi-Fi well
long press on home get us back to our
recent list okay and we're going to run
this again it's got some communication
issues because I was too fast and it's
still handing off to the cellular
network there so this is a HSPA
compatible phone now when I say HSPA I
don't mean hspa+ okay that's a big
difference hspa+ lets you do superfast
speeds 21 megabit per second some day 42
megabit per second I don't know where
are we already there yet I don't have
any phones that have reported that fast
so it really doesn't matter to me but
looks like we're here we go 3g is what
we're getting right here again HSPA try
that again here and this time we're all
connected up now with tmobile the ping
is usually pretty good we're seeing this
a little bit high in my opinion anything
below 300 milliseconds is generally
acceptable I like to see that in the
double digits down here you can see
we're getting right around one megabit
per second up and on the flip side we're
seeing usually about half that excuse me
1.1 down and about half that up this
case is written a little bit slower than
that so having an hspa+ compatible phone
really helps speed things up in this
case you can see some of the limitations
of not having that plus at the end but
it's still very respectable and
reasonably fast so let's go back and do
some other benchmarks shall we that's
okay smart bench quadrant standard and
linpack pro or are three standard
benchmarking utilities water
benchmarking utilities well there's a
lot of people who comment on my videos
that say that one is biased over another
and
it's fake and it's not reliable you know
what that's true of all benchmarks a
benchmark literally goes out and it runs
a series of tests and the tests are
supposed to be the same and then you're
the only difference there then is the
device that you're running them on the
processor speed the RAM file i/o and
whatnot graphics processing as you can
see here that way since those are the
only variables and the tests are there
the standard there the control factor
they're not changing their the constants
that's the word I'm looking for then
what you're measuring is the difference
in speed between one device and another
kind of makes sense so different
benchmarks test different ways and they
test different things that's why we run
through several of them hopefully so you
can see a kind of a wide variety of
various different tests you know just
looking at them it's kind of fun but you
can also see how they perform what they
do and and then of course get the end
result which is the benchmark result the
score itself so that you can take that
men compared to other devices so this is
going to run through a series of several
other tests we'll come back in when the
results are up so you can see how well I
did okay so I just ran smart bench 2011
on my t-mobile g2 it is running
cyanogenmod 7.01 7.1 release candidate
and it is overclocked a little bit but
you can see my productivity and my games
index are 17 17 and 16 14 respectively
show you where that falls we got to come
way down here into these guys so the
nvidia corbis five the samsung galaxy s
Samsung Galaxy S HTC EVO 3d samsung epic
4g so right where you'd expect it to be
some of the devices that are faster than
that are of course the galaxy s2 and
some of the LG optimus 2x the phones
that you'd expect so why am i showing
you the g2 well i want to show you the
results rather than
yeah it didn't finish well it did finish
but it kind of failed if you can read
back here says it's got invalid results
for pie please don't switch out of the
benchmark during the test well I didn't
I ran it straight through a bank this is
the second time running through and it
keeps giving me these problems so we
have to give this a did not complete if
you have been able to successfully run
smart bench 2011 please post your
productivity score and your game score
in the comments so we can know what this
benchmark SAT but that having been said
let's go ahead and get out of there and
move on to the next benchmark shall we
okay we're back to the g2 I want to show
you linpack pro for android we're going
to run this in multi-thread and this
says it could take 30 seconds or more
now this is going to run through a bunch
of tests oh and look it's done shows me
that I've got forty two point oh eight
three mega flops took 4.1 seconds the
normal result is 3.24 is that resolution
anyway really pretty good I didn't want
to show you that over here on the
Wildfire s main reason because it took
twenty five point eight five seconds now
the mega flips on this one are six point
five to six whether than the other one
which was 42 and the normal res is 3.2
for which is the same thing this got an
inconsistent result now in all honesty
so did this one the first time I ran it
so that's not necessarily a bad thing
running a single thread usually takes a
little bit more time but this is just
again a test of how fast the processor
is how fast so you can get stuff in and
out of RAM and you can see here really
where the 600 megahertz processor
compared to the overclocked to 1.5
gigahertz processor that was um 801 it
shipped by the way I really can come
into play but let's not dwell too long
on that we still got quadrant standard
and this is one of my fans most favorite
benchmark utility so I always have to
include it it's not too exciting up
front it just runs through some tests
where it gets fun is where it gets into
the 2d and 3d graphics and we'll see if
if it's going to
with any kind of speed I'll go ahead and
start the g2 kind of side by side here
just so you can see so I just barely
started the G to see if we can fit those
both on screen and you can see we're
already down into graphics with the g2
and the Wildfire s is still kind of
plugging along doing what it can it's
working on the IO right now the database
rights now that's internal memory it
doesn't have anything to do with the
external memory the SD card it does come
with a samsung branded two gig micro SD
card which generally speaking is
somewhere between a class two and a
class four I believe in this case it's a
class-4 so it's really not that bad you
can see the graphics not bad I mean it
looks pretty good it's just a little bit
slower let's go ahead and look at the
results results over here on the g two
are 25 36 again that's overclocked from
800 megahertz to 1.5 gigahertz we're
still running through the test over on
the Wildfire s which is wrapping up go
ahead and submit that so we can share it
and this result is 720 that means it's
faster than the original nexus one and
HTC Desire which are basically the same
phone it's faster than the original
motorola droid and the xperia x10i
slower obviously then the samsung galaxy
s the droid x the evo 2.2 plus and
basically anything that runs android 2.2
or higher so how well did it perform in
this test well not that great but still
it's faster than the original nexus one
in the the benchmark results so all in
all not too bad so that's going to bring
us right to the end of our software
review for this little guy and we're
just going to conclude with the overall
how well did it fair results of course
to get the full write-up head over to
pocketnow.com so you can see more detail
about what we go into what we test and
our overall impressions what we put it
through first and foremost i use this
thing heavily as my daily driver for
about a week in fact a little bit
longer so t-mobile who lent us this
device we appreciate that I've kept it a
little bit longer than I was supposed to
I hope you don't mind and again as part
of the FCC disclaimer all of these
results are our own and they're not
influenced at all by t-mobile other than
the little references I've been making
over here to the the specifications and
features list that they included with
the phone which basically tells me what
the hardware specs are and what not and
some of the software that's included
with it but it's a great all-around
device if you are looking for an
entry-level android-powered device or
even if you're just looking for a new
phone that's a little bit smarter than a
dumb phone this is your phone very
simply this is it this is the one you
want this is the one you want for your
kids this is the one you want for your
mom this is the one that you want for
your wife if your wife isn't a really
high-end power user my wife is a power
user she needs a higher rent phone she
has a nexus one this phone wasn't fast
enough for her my daughter my son they
both loved this device it fits their
hand better it goes in their pockets
easier it's just an all around good
device it works and it does everything
they wanted it to the one area that
they're going to run into a little bit
of a problem is because this is a
smaller phone because it's a cheaper
phone and by that I mean less expensive
it's HTC so it's really high quality
it's not really all that fast as far as
graphics goes now that means games are
going to work well and that's part of
their demographic is kids teenagers on
they're not going to like this all that
much because it doesn't play games that
well now when I say games I'm talking
more the high-end stuff to OpenGL stuff
games like cut the rope works great
games like Angry Birds works just fine
games like Gun brothers not gonna do it
games like some of your car games racing
games again not going to do it that well
it'll still run and it still works okay
but again they're going to be a little
bit disappointed there for an overall
feature phone I mean this blows away
your flip phones this blows away your
future phones this this is a fabulous
this is a wonderful first step into the
smartphone
rolled and I think that's what t-mobile
is trying to do with the Wildfire s of
course the Wildfire s is nothing new its
new to tmobile it's new to the US but
nothing new to the rest of the world
who've had it in Europe and Asia for
quite some time and I can see why they'd
like it overall I'm going to have to
give this phone high marks if you want
to see exactly how high those marks are
head on over to pocketnow.com it's going
to take us a day or so to get the final
review up of the entire review of this
device but I think you'll be pleasantly
surprised with it of course if you like
this video and seeing stuff this
in-depth give the video a thumbs up
subscribe to our video channel so you
can make sure to see new videos and of
course that includes hardware and
software reviews and my favorite or new
unboxing so make sure you subscribe so
you can see those and again head over to
pocketnow.com so you can see not only
the write-ups on this phone but on other
phones as well if you're new to the
channel we also get really into some
some daily news and into how to hack
these things to do anything you want
just kind of a plug there so without any
further ado make sure you leave your
comments down below and for
pocketnow.com showing off the HTC
Wildfire s for t-mobile i'm joe levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
