today I've got the software review of
the HTC Wildfire s by t-mobile this time
it's gonna be great alright so I said
this time it's gonna be great what do I
mean by that well this guy has a
different screen than a lot of phones
that I've looked at in the past it's
really nice in hand it looks really
pretty good there are a couple caveats
to it that we'll get to a little bit
later in the video
but for some reason this little camera
is well camera shy and I know this is a
phone but a lot of people are going to
use this as their point-and-click camera
and their all-around multimedia device
it's just a little bit ironic that it's
so difficult to catch this guy on film
and make it look anywhere halfway decent
I don't know exactly why that is but
let's go into some some of the caveats
of this screen now first of all it's a
little bit smaller and when I say
smaller I mean dimensionally this guy is
really small we talked about that in the
previous video in the hardware video so
if you haven't watched that make sure
you go back in the channel and check
that out this is only 3.2 inches and the
resolution on it isn't all that great
it's 320 by 480 and it's got 260 mm
colors on it now that's part of the
issue let me lift this guy up a little
closer to the camera I don't know if you
can see it but there appears to be
banding on on the display and when I say
banding I don't mean traditional banding
like less colors so you have striping
and whatnot of the colors where it goes
from one color to another color without
a nice transition in between no I don't
mean that in fact that's really pretty
good what I mean is there appear to be
little interlaced lines going through it
that kind of cut the resolution in a
little bit lower maybe even in half why
that is I don't know I think it's just a
characteristic of the screen but it is
something you need to kind of be aware
of and know that it's okay that's what
it's supposed to do it's a lower end
with a lower-end display and that's one
of the things that they did - well to
make it less expensive now that having
been said look at this guy you hold it
in your hand just like this
reflections notwithstanding and it's
perfect if it's really nicely it's
really really comfortable this is one of
the best all-around phones to hold in
your hand and and its really a good
entry-level phone now I'm a power user
so I really like power devices and with
those power devices usually come big
bulky blocks like my g2 we've shown you
this in the previous video but just to
do a little side-by-side I'm paying
that's a big comparison and I zoomed in
deliberately so that the g2 wouldn't all
fit on screen but you kind of get the
point well let's get back into software
first of all what does this guy come
prepackaged with well it's Android 2.3
so not the latest version but still
pretty good it also comes prepackaged
with HTC senses HTC Sense version 2.1
not the 3d version like the e both ridi
and some of the other phones out there
have this is just the standard 2d and it
is version 2.1 not three not three five
but 2.1 why did they do that well this
guy has a 600 megahertz processor in it
and we'll see some of those in the
benchmarks a little bit later to see how
that impacts it so let's see what it
comes it pre-installed with if I can
scroll down here that's the radio app
okay so first of all you'll notice my
little scroll bar over on the side it
says that I'm about a third of the way
down the screen now one of the things I
really like about HTC Sense UI is the
fact that it's got a paginate 'add app
drawer so I can look at one page and
then another page and then another page
just like that so I'm not scrolling
between an infinite list of stuff kind
of nice I really like that it's nothing
new so let's go ahead and just look at
what it comes with this is a t-mobile
device so it's got some t-mobile apps
pre-loaded on it not an awful lot it's
also an HTC Sense device so it's got
some HTC Sense stuff pre-loaded
again not enough a lot we've got four
one one and more which is t-mobile's
four one one and information app lets
you get all kinds of stuff directory
assistance weather horoscope sports and
of course it's paid by ads let's go back
Adobe Reader comes pre-installed it's
got the nice HTC calculator with the
nice big buttons on it just can come in
very handy at times
the HTC calendar HTC camcorder and
camera which are very very functional
very nice
the HTC clock app which has your alarms
and whatnot Download Manager which is
coming more and more standard on more
devices DT sync now this is doubleTwist
syncs up your iTunes library and whatnot
so kind of nice sometimes you have
problems with that where
iTunes kind of blocks stuff like that
from happening I don't have an iTunes
device so I haven't tried that app out
but we'd like to know your comments
leave that down in the comments down
below if you think that that's a good
addition bad Edition if you have any any
good experiences our bad experience with
it we kind of showed you the FM radio
now this is just what it sounds like it
is literally an FM receiver in your
phone you do have to have your
headphones plugged in up here that
serves as the antenna to receive those
radio stations and then you can come
down here and just very easily scan
through the stations of course I can't
do that because I don't have the
headphone antenna plugged in but if you
want to get some regular analog radio
signals over-the-air you can do that
very easily with the FM radio very nice
friend stream that's HTC's unified
Facebook and Twitter aggregator shows
you what all your friends are talking
about all in one the gallery is very
simply the HTC gallery Gmail Google
search you know what all that is the HTC
hub kind of the the center of all things
HTC and you can see I haven't set that
back up for this version of the video
HTC likes that's well the stuff that HTC
likes some recommended apps and whatnot
Internet is your browser it's the
the HTC version of the browser so it
looks very HTC ish latitude I don't
remember that came on the phone or if I
installed that later but it's a Google
app to help share your location with
your friends Linpack pro is a
benchmarking utility that I installed
we'll get to that male is the HTC email
client Maps is Google Maps market you
know that messages is the messaging
client again the HTC version of that
music is the HTC music player my account
and my device these are both from
t-mobile they help you get more
information about your device and your
account including minutes used and all
of that fun stuff
navigation goes along with latitude and
maps it's the Google GPS app news is
kind of fun it's basically just an RSS
aggregator for HTC cents this actually
ties in with the web browser pretty well
and lets you get RSS feeds through the
browser which you don't normally have by
default on a stock Android device peep
is HTC's Twitter utility the their
Twitter app if you will people is the
contacts app phone the phone app Places
is yet another one of the Google Maps
things that helps you find stuff locally
based on either a location you input or
your GPS location so that's really nice
quadrant is another benchmarking tool
we'll get to that settings and setup
kind of go hand-in-hand these are all
the settings after the fact this is the
setup that walks you through all of that
alright picking back up we've got
slacker which is a streaming radio
station really kind of cool very similar
to Pandora with a lot of different
features that I'm sure if I said it's
like Pandora I'd get a lot of hate mail
down in the comments so no it's not like
Pandora it's like Pandora smart bench
and speed tests are more bench marking
utilities again we'll get to that
t-mobile Mail is our t-mobile model
rather is well the apps the t-mobile
wants you to get make sure I'm telling
you the truth they're on that one yet we
all agree to that yes we know ok already
yeah kind of a pain in the neck so this
is
not really the t-mobile android market
but kind of it is it lets you get
ringtones caller tunes apps games all
kinds of stuff really has kind of a neat
interface I kind of like this over the
stock Android Market just saying but
anyway one of the cool things that it
comes with talk is Google Talk for
chatting and whatnot someday they're
going to integrate audio and video on
all phones and not just the Nexus S
family let's hope transfer is a utility
that lets you transfer stuff from your
old phone to your new one once you've
got an Android powered device you really
don't need that anymore but that's going
from like a non-smart phone over to to
this one visual voicemail is t-mobile's
version of Google Voice it tries to
transpose your voice messages and
whatnot Google Voice is something that I
add and on of course because I use
Google Voice voice search is a Google
Voice Search app utility it kind of
enhances things so you can do more fun
stuff with your search button down here
searching with your voice whether it's
the weather app YouTube is the YouTube
app Wi-Fi calling like you see right up
here is a t-mobile thing that lets you
make and receive calls over Wi-Fi when
you're under a Wi-Fi bubble now this
includes t-mobile bubbles it includes
work bubbles that includes your home
Wi-Fi bubble that includes your your
dorm you know all that fun stuff if you
don't get good reception in one of those
places not a problem
now whenever you're under that bubble
you're good to go it's a very simple app
you simply have well there's a tutorial
there that we're just going to try and
skip however we can skip it you've got a
button down here on and off so right now
it's on it sees what network I'm
connected to and everything's great now
the downside to this is you do have to
have your Wi-Fi turned on all the time
if you want to receive calls over Wi-Fi
when the screen is off making calls is
no problem because your screen is going
to be on for that but if you want to
receive incoming calls you've got to
have Wi-Fi on and that kind of drains
your battery so those of you who have
said do reviews with a full battery I'd
like to but it kind of sucked the
battery
cuz I got Wi-Fi colleague on now you can
disable that feature in the Wi-Fi setup
so it's not going to be sucking down
battery all the time just when the
screen is on which is what I have it set
to of course that means I'm not going to
receive calls unless I'm under the the
cellular network which I am here and in
which case it's going to come over the
cellular network now the first thing
you're going to notice this is a 600
megahertz processor inside of here as
far as processors ago it's not that fast
but scrolling between screens even with
the Sense UI and the animations really
is nice it's fluid the animations are
quick it looks good it's really an
all-around good phone now where you'll
run into some problems let me see if I
can get these specs for you and we
talked about them in the hardware review
the the RAM that is on this phone and
the the hard drive space if you will the
internal storage are both really really
limited so limited in fact that they
don't go over them on their spec sheet
they really don't want you to know so
not a lot we're talking you know half
gig tops we'll get into specifics in the
write-up over at pocketnow.com so make
sure you go and look at that what that
means is when I sync this up with my
account and it started pulling down all
of the apps for me I ran out of space
really really quick because it filled up
the internal memory and and that was it
so I had to get rid of a whole bunch of
stuff this is a relatively fresh install
that I've been using for the last
several days so let's go ahead and run a
couple tests first we're going to run
speed tests now this is connected to my
Wi-Fi it is 802 11 n go ahead and begin
that test for you so you can see it
we're going really quick here so really
not too bad on my g2 I tested it just
this morning I was above 10 megabit per
second down and above 3 megabit per
second up so this is performing pretty
well you know not all that great but 6.4
kilobits per second down and for kill or
megabits rather and 4 megabits per
second up with a really
low ping time so that is really not too
bad this is like I said an 802 11 and it
also does BMG it does not do a let's go
ahead and go back and run this again
over see if I can get into my settings
here we'll do this again over the
cellular network so we'll turn off Wi-Fi
well long press on home get us back to
our recent list okay and we're gonna run
this again it's got some communication
issues because I was too fast and it's
still handing off to the cellular
network there so this is a HSPA
compatible phone now when I say HSPA I
don't mean HSPA+ okay that's a big
difference
HSPA+ lets you do super fast speeds 21
megabit per second some day 42 megabit
per second I don't know are we already
there yet I don't have any phones that
have reported that fast so it really
doesn't matter to me but looks like
we're there we go
3G is what we're getting right here
again HSPA
try that again here and this time we're
all connected up now with t-mobile the
ping is usually pretty good we're seeing
this a little bit high in my opinion
anything below 300 milliseconds is
generally acceptable I like to see that
in the double digits down here you can
see we're getting right around one
megabit per second up and on the flip
side we're seeing usually about half
that excuse me
one point one down and about half that
up this case is written a little bit
slower than that so having an HSPA+
compatible phone really helps speed
things up in this case you can see some
of the limitations of not having that
Plus at the end but it's still very
respectable and reasonably fast so let's
go back and do some other benchmarks
shall we
that's okay smart bench quadrant
standard and Linpack pro are our three
standard benchmarking utilities water
benchmarking Utilities well there's a
lot of people who comment on my videos
that say that one is biased over
another and it's fake and it's not
reliable you know what that's true of
all benchmarks a benchmark literally
goes out and it runs a series of tests
and the tests are supposed to be the
same and then you're the only difference
there then is the device that you're
running them on the processor speed the
RAM file i/o and whatnot the graphics
processing as you can see here that way
since those are the only variables and
the tests are there the standard they're
the control factor they're not changing
their the constants that's the word I'm
looking for
then what you're measuring is the
difference in speed between one device
and another kind of makes sense so
different benchmarks test different ways
and they test different things that's
why we run through several of them
hopefully so you can see kind of a wide
variety of various different tests you
know just looking at them it's kind of
fun but you can also see how they
perform what they do and and then of
course get the end result which is the
benchmark result the score itself so
that you can take that and then compare
it to other devices so this is going to
run through a series of several other
tests we'll come back in when the
results are up so you can see how well I
did okay so I just ran smart bench 2011
on my t-mobile g2 it is running
CyanogenMod seven point zero one seven
point one release candidate and it is
overclocked a little bit but you can see
my productivity and my games index are
17 17 and 16 14 respectively show you
where that falls you got to come way
down here into these guys so the Nvidia
core biz 5 the Samsung Galaxy S samsung
galaxy s HTC EVO 3d Samsung Epic 4G so
right where you'd expect it to be some
of the devices that are faster than that
are of course the galaxy s2 and some of
the lg optimus 2x the phones that you'd
expect so why am i showing you the g2
well I want to show you the results
rather than
yeah it didn't finish well it did finish
but it kind of failed if you can read
back here says it's got invalid results
for pi please don't switch out of the
benchmark during the test well I didn't
I ran it straight through in fact this
is the second time running through and
it keeps giving me these problems so we
have to give this they did not complete
if you have been able to successfully
run smart bench 2011 please post your
productivity score and your game score
in the comments so we can know what this
benchmarks that but that having min said
let's go ahead and get out of there and
move on to the next benchmark shall we
okay we're back to the g2 I want to show
you a Linpack Pro for Android we're
gonna run this in multi thread and this
says it could take 30 seconds or more
now this is gonna run through a bunch of
tests look it's done it shows me that
I've got 40 2.08 three mega flops took
4.0 1 seconds the normal result is 3.2
fours that resolution anyway really
pretty good I didn't want to show you
that over here on the Wildfire s main
reason because it took twenty five point
eight five seconds now the mega flops on
this one are 6 point 5 to 6 rather than
the other one which was 42 and the
normal res is three point to 4 which is
the same thing this got an inconsistent
result now in all honesty so did this
one the first time I ran it so that's
not necessarily a bad thing running a
single thread usually takes a little bit
more time but this is just again a test
of how fast the processor is how fast
you can get stuff in and out of RAM and
you can see here really where the 600
megahertz processor compared to the
overclocked
to 1.5 gigahertz processor it was 800
when it shipped by the way it really can
come into play but let's not dwell too
long on that we've still got quadrant
standard and this is one of my fans most
favorite benchmark utility so I always
have to include it it's not too exciting
up front it just runs through some tests
where it gets fun is where it gets into
the 2d and 3d graphics and we'll see if
if it's going to run it with any
kind of speed I'll go ahead and start
the g2 kind of side by side here just so
you can see so I just barely started the
g2 see if we can fit those both on
screen and you can see we're already
down into graphics with the g2 and the
Wildfire s is still kind of plugging
along doing what it can it's working on
the IO right now the database writes now
that's internal memory it doesn't have
anything to do with the external memory
the SD card it does come with a Samsung
branded 2 gig microSD card which
generally speaking is somewhere between
a class 2 and a class 4 I believe in
this case it's a class 4 so it's really
not that bad you can see the graphics
not bad I mean it looks pretty good it's
just a little bit slower let's go ahead
and look at the results the results over
here on the g2 are 25 36 again that's
overclocked from 800 megahertz to 1.5
gigahertz we're still running through
the test over on the Wildfire s which is
wrapping up go ahead and submit that so
we can share it and this result is 720
that means it's faster than the original
Nexus 1 and HTC Desire which are
basically the same phone it's faster
than the original Motorola Droid and the
the Xperia x10 I slower obviously than
the Samsung Galaxy S the Droid X the Evo
2 point 2 plus and basically anything
that runs Android 2.2 or higher so how
well did it perform in this test well
not that great but still it's faster
than the original Nexus 1 in the the
benchmark results so all in all not too
bad so that's going to bring us right to
the end of our software review for this
little guy and we're just going to
conclude with the overall how well did
it fare results of course to get the
full write-up head over to pocketnow.com
so you can see more detail about what we
go into what we test and our overall
impressions what we put it through first
and foremost I use this thing heavily as
my daily driver for about a week in fact
a little bit
you're so t-mobile who lent us this
device we appreciate that I've kept it a
little bit longer than I was supposed to
I hope you don't mind and again as part
of the FCC disclaimer all of these
results are our own and they're not
influenced at all by t-mobile other than
the little references I've been making
over here to the the specifications and
features list that they included with
the phone which basically tells me what
the hardware specs are and whatnot and
some of the software that's included
with it but it's a great all-around
device if you are looking for an
entry-level Android powered device or
even if you're just looking for a new
phone that's a little bit smarter than a
dumb phone this is your phone very
simply this is it this is the one you
want this is the one you want for your
kids this is the one you want for your
mom this is the one that you want for
your wife if your wife isn't a really
high-end power user my wife is a power
user she needs a higher end phone she
has a nexus one this phone wasn't fast
enough for her my daughter my son they
both love this device it fits their hand
better and it goes in their pockets
easier it's just an all-around good
device it works and it does everything
they wanted it to the one area that
they're gonna run into a little bit of a
problem is because this is a smaller
phone because it's a cheaper phone and
by that I mean less expensive it's HTC
so it's really high quality it's not
really all that fast as far as graphics
goes now that means games are gonna work
well and that's part of their
demographic is kids teenagers they're
not gonna like this all that much
because it doesn't play games that well
now when I say games I'm talking more
the high-end stuff the opengl stuff
games like cut the rope works great
games like Angry Birds works just fine
games like gun brothers not gonna do it
games like some of your car games racing
games again not going to do it that well
it'll still run and it still works okay
but again they're gonna be a little bit
disappointed there for an overall
feature phone I mean this blows away
your flip phones this blows away your
future phones this this is fabulous this
is a wonderful first step into the smart
phone
and I think that's what t-mobile is
trying to do with the Wildfire s of
course the Wildfire s is nothing new
it's new to t-mobile it's new to the US
but nothing new to the rest of the world
who've had it in Europe and Asia for
quite some time and I can see why they'd
like it overall I'm gonna have to give
this phone high marks if you want to see
exactly how high those marks are head on
over to pocketnow.com
it's gonna take us a day or so to get
the final review up of the entire review
of this device but I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised with it of course
if you like this video and seeing stuff
this in-depth give the the video a

the write-ups on this phone but on other
phones as well if you're new to the
channel we also get really into some
some daily news and into how to hack
these things to do anything you want
just kind of a plug there so without any
further ado make sure you leave your
comments down below and for
pocketnow.com showing off the HTC
Wildfire s for t-mobile I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
