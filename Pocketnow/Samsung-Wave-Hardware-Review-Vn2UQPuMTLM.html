and if you watched our initial unboxing
video you saw that we kind of went into
some brief detail about the hardware of
the samsung wave however on this video
we're actually going to go into some
detail kind of show you the different
ports on the sides and show you the
screen itself do some outdoor tests and
just talk about some of the other
features that the hardware offers let's
get going alright we're back when you
probably heard me say a few times
already that the samsung wave has a
super amoled screen it's actually the
first device to have the Super AMOLED
screen it's the same screen that you're
going to see on the samsung galaxy s
phone it is finally released however I
do want to just give you a quick
comparison from the samsung wave to the
HTC evo now the evo is an LCD screen
whereas the wave once again is the Super
AMOLED screen and the main thing i want
to show you here is going to be the
color clarity and color accuracy a
little hard to tell it's actually
appearing a little darker right now and
that's because of the sensor basically
the life that I have is actually more
over the evil Center than it is the wave
sensor so don't worry about the
brightness with the two screens however
the color accuracy than color clarity
it's tough to tell with the camera but
it is much better on the wave much
clearer going back to the home screen
you can also see the fact that it does
look much this actually looks a little
washed out this looks much much better
much more clear put this guy's side now
one of the things that I really wanted
to check out what this phone was going
to be the outdoor screen test I can tell
you inside it looks fantastic however
outside samsung had said that it would
look great I want to test that theory so
here's the video for that alright I've
got ahead and actually moved outside so
that I can kind of give you the direct
sunlight test I apologize for any
background noise is actually some
construction going on by my house this
morning what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to try the screen on as you can see it's
a little tough to see it it's not smell
it's not the brightest me it's tough to
pick it up with the camera because there
is the glare from the camera but I can
definitely see what I'm doing right now
which is much better than I was
experiencing with the nexus one
especially so I'm going to do now
because I'm going to go ahead and go to
the settings though in terms of
brightness all
way and that should make it even better
so what that's done is it's made even
better and once again the camera is
picking up the glare if I bring us a
little closer you can still definitely
see it and this is in direct sunlight
right now it's again it's hard to kind
of reproduces on the camera but I can
definitely see what's going on I can go
to the phone here make a phone call if I
wanted to I can see everything perfectly
this is much better than my mind nexus
one it's about the same as the evil in
terms of the LCD screen i think the
brightest with this phone really helps
it kind of shines through the glare so
it's not really an issue for me I wish
it which is a little bit easier for me
to show this on the camera unfortunately
it's not but I believe it does pass the
test Samsung's claim does hold true to
its word right and we're back inside
after doing the outdoor screen test and
I kinda just want to go over the
hardware itself just as you see right
here the form factor the whole nine
yards it is a capacitive touchscreen
it's a three point three inch capacitive
touchscreen as you've heard me say
before it's a little narrow however I do
feel that the screen is very accurate
the on-screen keyboard works great so on
and so forth now on picking up the thumb
on the left side here we're going to
have the volume buttons the volume up
and down going over to the bottom I'm
going to have the microphone port moving
to the right we're going to have the
camera button this will bring up the
camera application as well as take
pictures which is very nice you want to
use the on-screen click to actually take
a picture that goes a long way in my
opinion then you also have your lock
button here that will actually lock the
screen which is actually a nice spot
when you're holding the phone you just
tap the button here moving to the top of
the phone oh she go flip this over first
off we have to speak it more or less the
speaker it's Elvis where the sound is
going to come from the music I think
it's great placement phones with the
speaker on the back really don't project
that while in my opinion it's playing
away from you whereas this guy will play
facing you or just a little bit closer
to you more or less we have a 3.5 inch
headphone jack so you can plug in any
standard headphones as well as
headphones that come in the box now
these headphones that come with the
phone have a antenna for the FM radio
application built right in moving on to
your charging port and your connection
port it is a micro USB as you can see
here it's a door is the USB logo the
door slides open and there's your micro
USB the front of the phone itself has a
sin
button the end button and then as well
as your menu button this will bring up
the menu of all the different apps that
you have as you see here you're going to
have an earpiece with various sensors
flipping over to the back we have a 5
megapixel camera with the power LED
flash takes fairly good pictures
especially in low light now this is a
brush metal battery door so I'm going to
ahead and pop this off a little switch
you just press there and there's the
battery once again I said before this is
a fifteen hundred million power battery
pulling that right off you're gonna have
a port for your microSD card up to 32
gigs this phone will come with two
gigabytes of onboard storage but you can
explain that up to 32 that's your
technically 34 and you have your SIM
card slot as well from a form factor
standpoint I have to say that this phone
feels fantastic in the hand picking it
right up its its then it's not very wide
which is nice going back to that lock
but on the side here it's very good
placement when i'm done with a phone
call i can literally just press the
button and put it right back into my
pocket in one swipe and also having that
speaker right there is great for me i
listen to a lot of podcast and being
able to actually hear the music now and
hear the people's voices goes a long way
from me so once again this is the
samsung wave if you like this video give
us a thumbs up make sure you subscribe
for more videos on the samsung wave and
many more devices to come and also of
this device interests you you can
actually pick it up at clove co uk for
around four hundred dollars thanks
