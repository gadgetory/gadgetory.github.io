few of you are kind of frustrated with
the way some of our YouTube videos
display or don't display on your mobile
device so in this video I'm going to
show the bug explain why that happens
and show you a workaround so you can
watch videos so first off let me do the
windows phone I have a review loaded and
if we scroll a little bit we see video
and you think I could press play and it
would play but it gives us an error
message about not having any of the
videos available the reason this happens
is because we have revenue-sharing
enabled on these videos and that uses
flash to display the ads so when I press
play it's going to try to use the flash
version and YouTube's iframe embed code
is not smart enough to recognize that
this is a Windows Phone that supports
html5 and it should show in html5 video
same with the iPhone you can see this
one does not load it just goes black
however with android youtube actually
does recognize the browser and put gives
us an html5 video this does not have
Flash installed but you can see it's
still going to work well maybe
anyway you work around for this oh yeah
yeah there's this that was working so
YouTube made sure that it works on
Android and on Windows Phone - to get
the videos to work let's find another
one
what I do is tap this title and that's
just going to load the video in the
YouTube html5 website which is
programmed to send us an html5 video so
we know that it plays on what is found
and that is just going to load the video
right there in a place so we find I've
volumes on view same with the iPhone I
tap the title that is going to ask me if
I want to open it in YouTube and then I
get a nice full screen view of that
video
so there's your workaround
it's kind of annoying I know that
YouTube doesn't send the proper video to
the proper web browser but the work is
pretty easy give us a thumbs up if you
liked this video and if you want to
contact YouTube feel free to let them
know about this book and how annoying it
is that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
