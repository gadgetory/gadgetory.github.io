pocket now calm at long last Google has
released Google Maps for iOS devices
ending our frustrations with Apple maps
it's a really awesome application but
there are a lot of hidden gestures that
you need to know about if you have an
iPhone in this video we're going to
cover all of them let's get to it okay
lots to talk about here and be sure you
subscribe to the pocket now video
YouTube channel that way you know first
when we upload new videos we'll put a
link up up here so you can subscribe
easily so let's get into it here now of
course in all maps applications you can
pinch to zoom right but that's really a
two-handed affair you need to take out
your other hand to study the phone and
then you can do the pinch to zoom in
Google Maps here in iOS there's a new
way to zoom with really one hand and the
way you do that is you double tap and
slide you see that so you double tap
anywhere you want to zoom and slide your
finger up and down as if the screen
becomes a zoom slider and you could do
that with any finger just a really handy
convenient way to zoom in and zoom out
really quickly if you don't want to use
two hands the other gesture well there
are several more gestures we're going to
show you the other gesture which isn't
new to maps apps is the the rotate I
guess the rotate of the map which is
great especially if you're in a city
where you have these beautiful building
models and the other gesture is the two
finger tilt right so Apple Maps has this
and Google Maps has have this a while
for a while on Android but the last
Google Maps update for iOS Y was a five
didn't have this capability which was
quite frustrating so it's awesome to see
it back in iOS because it's so handy if
you're moving around and you want to
reposition various things on the screen
the next thing we want to show you is
the side menu which of course you can
access down here by tapping that that'll
allow you to turn on satellite view
public transit and get traffic
information there's actually a quicker
way to access that it's not as intuitive
you take two fingers and you swipe in
from the center of the screen on the
right so watch and there it goes
so depending on how you are oriented
if you are walking down the street you
obviously are going to press the button
down here because it's a one-handed
thing if you're on a tabletop like I am
here the two finger swipe seems to work
very very well
another tip here is that you definitely
want to sign in to your google account
like I have here that way you get your
search history and if you're using an
Android device if you have an Android
device or if you've set up Google to
know where you live and where you work
it's really convenient because it places
the markers right on the map which is
fantastic and again it keeps a search
history here of all of the things that
you've searched for so you can go back
and see what you've been looking for now
from this menu which is accessible over
here with this little person icon you
can access the settings and there aren't
that many settings there's one thing
that I've turned off here is the shake
to send feedback because I've had some
accidental shakes just by walking around
using Google Maps and it brings up this
screen that says do you want to send
feedback and I really don't want to be
bothered with that so I turn that off
now something else that you can do here
in terms of gesture well let's search
for pizza right now we're going to
search for pizza New York and what we
get is the map that we're used to and
all these points of interest that you
can tap on but another way that you can
navigate and you just saw down there is
you swipe from side to side to go
through all of the different results
that you have on the screen here it's
just a nice way to interact and see the
marker jump around so you can find out
which pizza place is closest to you and
you can from here click on the car and
it's going to be a long drive and this
is the navigation it's got real built-in
navigation the various routes are shown
to you whether you want to take take a
route that has more traffic or less
traffic or more tolls or less tools and
so forth and you find the one that you
want which leads us to our next tip when
we click start what you have here is
your guided instructions and you can
swipe here at the top to get a preview
of all the turns that you're going to
make Apple Maps doesn't let you do this
and it's great to be able to like move
along your route and see exactly which
turns you're going to make and kind of
plan your trip and see what's going on
that way
so that was a look at Google Maps on iOS
right now it's iPhone only you might be
wondering if there's an iPad app coming
if I were a betting man I would say yes
there's definitely a Google Maps version
coming for the iPad in the next few
months
more people have iPhones then do iPads
so Google just wanted to release the
product first for the most amount of
people if you're wondering how the
iPhone 5 is holding up we have an after
the buzz episode where we talked about
how the device is holding up after
several months of use after the newness
and the buzz wore off from the initial
time spent with the device so if you
want to see that we're going to put a
link up on the video it's highly
recommended really interesting and if
you like this video please shoot us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
