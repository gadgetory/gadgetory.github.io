memory that up from market now calm and
we're at the sprint event and trevor is
going to show as the LG viper which was
just announced by sprint and brings LTE
connectivity to the sprint network now
tell me about it Trevor great yes so
this is one of three devices that we've
announced its the Viper 4G LTE so
obviously it's Adele me device the big
story on the the Viper is that it's an
environmentally friendly device so Rick
is really dedicated to green causes and
the device itself is roughly thirty five
percent and I'm three x percent recycled
materials Christopher is a big part of
the device itself one thing you'll
notice wrap the man is just got a really
beautiful design oh I love that brushed
metal at the back it looks awesome
absolutely ok tell me about what are we
have here what kind of camera is up so
from aspects perspective you've got a
five megapixel camera on the back here
and it's going to flash yeah on the
frontier there's actually a VGA
front-facing camera okay it's running
Android do not three ok so we've
announced their devices with four dot oh
yes we got three upgradable it's going
to stay that way are we going to get
portato actually get the ability to
upgrade to four da no but I think at
launch will actually launch with two not
three okay okay one thing you notice is
a big display so forage Nova display
zoology is really bright Nova display Oh
interesting so we've got the Nova
display on this device also absolutely
okay now we've got stock Android here
there's no sort of a different UI it's
just the plain old Android Gingerbread
right in general yeah so there's a lot
of a lot of people for further
okay actually good one thing that we
will do so this is fairly early from a
from a hardware software perspective but
we actually do include your incentive
okay it spreads ID in general is for
people who maybe are new to android or
just looking for ways to build out packs
basically so different Sprint ID packs
like the MTV pack or the fashion pack or
the green pack give you the ability to
actually deploy applications that are
really specific to the pack itself okay
now tell me what applications is the
phone have to take advantage of the LTE
connectivity well obviously anything
it's multi made me do oriented anything
in Android so things like streaming
video okay audio those things certainly
I'll take care of take advantage of LTE
saying that's really bandwidth
consumption okay interesting now do we
have any specific service or the
front-facing camera it's only who will
talk typical yeah there's I mean they're
actually the number of services through
the market itself something like quick I
don't think we're loading necessarily
anything other than Google products that
are specific to the front-facing
products like quickies certainly can
download from the market itself okay now
let me hold it a bit we've got like I
said we've got this beautiful brush
middle of the back awesome design with
the camera 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and it seems we have a noise
cancellation speaker at the top also
this side doesn't have anything really
sleep anything here we've got the volume
buttons and the micro is needs the micro
USB connector sorry very beautiful
device actually what's the pricing and
availability timid mid-tier device we
have it up right now I haven't actually
announced the pricing and we've nounced
timing-wise first half of 2012 opener
but again a mid-tier device so not
necessarily the two to three hundred
dollar over that's great this is a great
entry-level device absolutely ok Trevor
thank you very much awesome review very
good demo this is a great device for you
to start with let's wait to see when the
pricing and availability would be this
