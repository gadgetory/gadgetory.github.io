improvements to come with its hardware
t-mobile admits to tinkering with
YouTube video on purpose and Microsoft
finally acknowledges that it did
terribly with windows 10 mobile am I not
even a happy new year to you all and
while I fly to vegas for CES expect some
more coverage to come this is parking
out daily the official news today begins
sadly with tmobile as if you remember
youtube was recently complaining that
t-mobile was throttling its video
quality or downgrading it in order to i
don't know you just keep their data
consumption down or whatever but hate
t-mobile has just admitted this
according to the company throttling is
not the right word but downgrading is as
they're just making it mobile optimized
as if that would look any great on your
quad HD display other official news come
from Microsoft as the company CEO Satya
Nadella was recently in an interview and
one of the major questions was windows
10 mobile according to nadella the
current stance in market share of
windows 10 mobile is so bad it's
unsustainable which is a very strong
word for the future of windows 10 mobile
but he also said he has a lot of faith
in whatever comes next so far we don't
ask her our reviews of the Lumia 950 950
XL but we can't wait for things to get
fixed we'll see we're talking about a
1.7 market share right now coming from a
company that owned four percent last
year moving over to rumors we've got
some trusted sources claiming that AT&amp;amp;T
is ready to put contracts to rest as of
January eighth apparently the company is
going to stick to installment plans and
no longer make a requirement for you to
sign it to your contract if you want a
phone after you pay a subsidy this can
be both good and bad for some people
it's a good thing for other peoples it's
not we'd love to know in the comments
down below for you but this be a good
move or not as will the spotlight over
to android where we know that Android
wear 1.4 is currently being tested and
if you remember those news that the
Huawei watch includes a speaker it seems
that what are the major enhancements
here is that it an a
Bulls the speaker for the watches that
support it and the huawei watch is one
we're not really sure there are others
already most likely there are we're
expecting the probability of the watch
urbane being one of these given you know
the connection between LG and Google but
yeah it seems that you will get speaker
support we're not exactly sure what for
though hopefully phone calls and
hopefully they work better than the
Apple watch and finally the very
interesting news or rumors should we say
of that they have to do with the LG g5
one of the most anticipated phones of
next year apparently LG is not planning
to bring major changes to what we
already know what the LG v10 actually
these changes are a little negative
should we say as well apparently we're
getting the same dual camera of the v10
the same duel you know display but it
seems that the display is actually
getting smaller 5.3 inches in a diagonal
addition the battery is apparently
losing up to 200 milliamp hours you're
not exactly sure if this has to do with
any optimizations or whatever we do know
that LG is betting a lot on improving
the design of this feature g5 but it
does lead me to the question of the day
are you looking out for the LG g5 next
year is that a phone in your radar
because in my case it always is
particularly because of the great camera
and the expandability but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends as always you know
the drill if you want to get the nose

comment subscribe to channel as well and
