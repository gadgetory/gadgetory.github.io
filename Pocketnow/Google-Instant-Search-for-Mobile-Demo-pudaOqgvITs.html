and you know what Google is pretty cool
and its really pretty fast you type
something in you either hit that I'm
feeling lucky or the search button and
usually within a second or two you get
the results back some people think
that's not fast enough and google has
listened to them so now you can start
typing and get results back before you
even hit enter well it's been out there
on the desktop for I don't know what two
weeks three weeks maybe now it's coming
to Android and iPhone so let's go take a
look and see how it works all right
instant search is divided up into two
different types if you will first is
search suggestion and that's where you
type something into the search bar and
it says hey based on what you've typed i
think you mean this kind of search now
that's an AJAX call or an asynchronous
requests where you're sending little
bits of information from here out to
google and back again in the background
without having to reload the whole page
it just does little bits and pieces of
the pages and it does that all
asynchronously so you don't have to wait
for a full page post back that's a lot
of geeky web terminology and if you want
me to go into that in a separate post
there's an entirely different website
you can go to for that let's focus here
on Android and also on iphone as well
because this update came out today for
both Android 2.2 and above and for
iphone so I'm not going to show you on
an iPhone or an iPad but the result is
basically the same and you don't even
need an app for this this is right there
in their their web experience so what do
you do the other part the other kind of
ajax requests here is is kind of kind of
cool and we've had it on the desktop
browser for a while to get it what I'm
going to need to do first is turn this
instant search on so we're just going to
tap that and just like that we've got
this instant which is still in beta
turned on and then we can turn it off if
we want to now I'm going to open up the
keyboard here so we can start typing
this in so i'll put our cursor back in
there and i'm going to type in POC
e and this first part that's the search
suggestions like we were just talking
about but you can see down here I've
already got some search results both
sponsored results and then down
underneath that I have actual search
results so it's thinking I'm looking for
the poconos or maybe pocahontas or
Pocono casinos whatever right which I'm
not so obviously that's not right but if
it were I'd have my search results there
I wouldn't have to hit enter I wouldn't
have to wait for it to go out to google
and come back with the results because
it's already right there so that's going
to save me some speed from a user
experience but it's actually going to
take more time and more overhead from a
data or a back-end experience well since
you and I don't run Google and we don't
run 18 to your t-mobile that's not much
of a concern for us where end users so
let's see how this works with what I'm
looking for let's go ahead and continue
typing here so I've got POC k e T then
now thinks I'm looking for pocket tanks
official pocket tanks you gotta get it
yeah I'm not looking for that I'm
looking for pocket now and as I did that
now my instant search results or my
search suggestions come up with relevant
stuff so I can immediately do one of
those searches but down here in my
instant results it shows me that hey
look at that pocketnow.com is the first
result and the second and third and why
look at that we're doing really well
we're like the whole page when you
search for pocket now but I haven't
searched for it I haven't hit enter yet
this is just all instantly returned to
me without hitting enter so it's it's
kind of like the i'm feeling lucky
button on the desktop version of google
on steroids kind of neat where does this
analogy fail well let me show you now I
pulled the keyboard out here for a
reason let me switch devices now this is
a g2 I'm going to switch over to the HTC
Desire HD and we're going to do the same
thing we are going to turn on the
instant search and we're going to come
in here and search for pocket now so
start typing p o sea que waiting e
and for some reason instant bait is off
okay maybe I did that wrong but let's go
ahead and start over here we'll turn
this on now it should be on come back in
here p OC ke t so we're back to pocket
tanks and 0 w all right now here's what
i wanted to show you right up at the top
we've got our search bar we've got three
search suggestions we've got one search
result and we've got our big on-screen
keyboard now if we come over here into
landscape mode we don't even have that
anymore we just have our search bar our
suggestions in our keyboard but let's
switch back to portrait so here we are
I've only got one result if this isn't
the result that I'm looking for it's not
really all that helpful now yes if I hit
the back button and get rid of the
keyboard you can see I've got a couple
more results in here in fact quite a few
of them so that's great but that soft
keyboard kind of gets in the way so is
instant search as useful on handheld
devices like Android and the iphone and
ipad and whatnot as it is on a desktop
device or a laptop or a netbook I don't
know not so much unless your result is
the first one in line now the search
suggestions are they still useful
absolutely i think this is one of the
best things that Google has done it
helps you find what you're looking for
without you necessarily knowing what
you're looking for because it's got
these suggestions in here if you wanted
to look up the the puckett now hd2
android if that were what i was looking
for i could tap on that without knowing
that it's an hd2 that i'm looking for or
information about the hd2 on
pocketnow.com so kind of helpful this
according to google's release is only
available for android 2.2 and above they
have to throw in the above because
android 2.3 should be out later this
month at least in the SDK and honeycomb
should be out sometime after that this
should work on all those browsers and up
does it work on to point o devices on
1.5 and 1.6 devices I don't know
2.1 I don't know that's where we need
you guys to tell us if you've got one of
those older devices or you know they're
not even all that old but if you've got
2.1 or below and you don't have the
option for instant search go ahead and
leave those that information in the
comments if you've got an iphone like a
3g 3gs we'd like to know if you have
that feature in in your browser
experience as well so go ahead and let
us know that in the comments subscribe
to our video channel if you'd like to
continue seeing stuff like this of
course Google is big in the search
industry and searching is very big on
handheld mobile devices and of course we
want to be able to not only stay up on
top of that ourselves but keep you up to
speed as well and you can do that
without subscribing to our video channel
then visiting pocketnow.com frequently
so showing off what you can do with the
new instant search on the google website
from your pocket device i'm joe for
