with some minor enhancements Apple has
just released the ipad 2 so we run there
are predictions on the next-generation
iphone with these changes and yeah we'll
definitely talk about the things you
didn't get on the March second event all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi metairie vet and
welcome to the park and now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and the not-so-cool inside the world of
apples iowa's devices March second event
happened the ipad 2 was released and so
with iOS 4.3 lots of stuff to talk about
so let's start off with the cool stuff
and well the coolest news of the week
was not necessarily having apple
launched the ipad 2 or announced iOS 4.3
for march 11th but having Steve Jobs run
the March second keynote on his own even
though he's still on medical leave
really good to see that he's still there
and he's still running business well
aside from that iOS 4.3 only brings
minor enhancements first of all you get
enhancements to airplay for third-party
developers to use these services through
an Apple TV really hope to see something
happen there with games aside from that
we get itunes home sharing for iOS
devices and also we do get an enhanced
JavaScript engine for Safari on mobile
devices really not major changes it's
still on gold master candidate for
developers and you'll be asking why
these minor changes are not on the
not-so-cool section a little more on
that a bit later and while even though
we don't cover the iPad here a lot of
the changes that made it to the iPad one
eventually made it to the iphone 4 so
expect the same thing for the next
generation iPhone the iPad 2 got an 85
dual-core processor nine times better
graphics HDMI mirroring out through an
adapter which even gives you 1080p and
even a thinner design of the current
generation iphone 4 if that's even
possible so these are really cool
changes for the next generation iphone 4
not really groundbreaking but do expect
them to happen any time in june and well
on Apple Store news it seems that
Apple's finally working with music
companies to allow you to download
whatever songs you've purchased more
than once meaning if you already
downloaded a song on your iPhone you can
also download it again on your iPad
without the need of syncing the songs
between devices my thoughts on that what
took you so long you could also already
do that with applications aside from
that will on the iBookstore it seems
that Apple finally bought or brought
random house to bring their 17 thousand
titles to make it to the iBookstore
really cool changes again what took you
so long and while on a recent interview
to Tim Cook Apple CEO oh it was clear
that Apple is working on a cheaper
iPhone not really sure if that will be a
cheaper current iphone with cheaper
materials or a variant for the iPhone
that is cheaper if it is a cheaper
iPhone only let's just hope that Apple
makes it cheaper for everybody not
necessarily only for them or carriers
well that does it for the cool that's
continuing on with the not so cool what
didn't we get on the March second event
well first of all the ipad 2 is not 4g
it did not get external storage it did
not get more built-in storage iOS 5 was
not announced with no veteran has
notification system we did not get
changes on mobileme we still have to pay
honored bucks for it and there's no
music streaming services through it so
expect no groundbreaking changes for the
next generation iphone either aside from
that so you know that was it and well
one weird thing about iOS 4.3 gold
master is the fact that the personal
hotspot feature will only be for three
devices and not five like you get on the
verizon iphone oh and aside from that
that iOS 4.3 update will not be
available for Verizon customers or for
the iphone 3g either so not cool at all
and well the a5 processor news are not
necessarily good news for everybody yet
see the reason why greenpoison is so
effective in jailbreaking iOS devices is
because the shatter exploit is able to
work on the a4 chip no matter what iOS
changes come to it and we really don't
know what to expect with the a5 chip
just yet the chronic dev team and the
depth in haven't mentioned anything so
let's wait for March 11th then see what
happens that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm hi mitul
iveta remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
