pocket now calm and this is the hardware
review of the google nexus s let's get
to it so first of all we have to give
credit to samsung in 2010 for extending
and really utilizing the galaxy s
platform not only on the galaxy s and
the galaxy s other phones but they've
used it on the samsung focus and now in
the Google Nexus S and what that means
is that you get the same sort of
specifications same kind of device
across all of these different sort of
phones that have different names we've
got the 4 inch Super AMOLED display and
super amoled is still unrivaled in
clarity and contrast compared to any
other screen out there it's got the 1
gigahertz hummingbird processor 512
megabytes of ram Wi-Fi with wireless n I
mean the specs are pretty much the same
across all the devices 5 megapixel
camera sometimes with a flash sometimes
without front-facing camera sometimes
sometimes not and as we're going to see
in a minute this device is basically the
same as the Samsung Focus same as the
18t captivate just with different
software but of course we have to
remember the original nexus one which
was made by HTC a completely different
device but similarly spect it just looks
very much different it's got that HTC
style with the trackball the buttons
below the screen it's got sort of a
really good in hand feels feel super
high quality compared to the Nexus S
which is kind of lightweight and a
little bit cheap feeling some well if it
gets cheap but those that appreciate the
lightweight feel really won't care that
much the nexus s make use of some pretty
good materials that had a rubbery
backing here if got really solid in hand
and it's still a really great phone you
know about a year since its release and
it's going to continue to be a good
phone because Google is going to upgrade
the nexus one to Gingerbread like the
nexus s already has and the Nexus S will
presumably have an even longer life than
the nexus one as future versions of
Android are released okay so let's talk
about the hardware the actual design
here of the Nexus
s now you may have read about the
contour display which I've come to the
conclusion is just marketing talk
because it really doesn't mean that much
it's not curved that much in fact the
screen part that you actually use is
pretty much flat and then on the edges
you get a little bit of a curve this
looks cool and that's pretty much it
yeah it feels a little bit better
against your face when you're talking on
the phone because most people's faces
are curved but you shouldn't be holding
the phone up to your face that much
anyway until somebody concludes whether
cell phone radiation is good or bad for
our brains use speakerphone if you can
and of course the speakerphone on the
Nexus S is very high quality just like
it was on the google nexus one so
besides this contour display we have a
front facing video camera which you can
also use for photos self-portraits and
videos i will take vga pictures or vga
video i should say and over here is the
light sensor and the proximity sensor
and we get this nice blue glow to the
screen that you get also on the other
Samsung Galaxy S devices down here you
don't get to see the hardware buttons
until you turn on the device and then
they appear as you can see it's really
interesting to see how with every
generation or it seems that with every
new samsung android device or even you
could say this for any android device
the placement of the buttons keeps
changing so let's look here at the
placement of these buttons next to the
nexus one ok so the home button is here
the home buttons on the right completely
different placement even if we take a
look at this device next to the
captivate here you know one of the true
galaxy s smartphones the buttons are
different place in all of these devices
it's very strange why they don't just
stick to one configuration of buttons so
as mentioned these buttons will light up
when you're using the phone and they're
capacitive and they vibrate a little bit
when you touch them which of course you
can turn off that feature it's really
striking this piece of glass on the
front it is pretty cool got to say but
again it's not curved as much as you
think it is but you've probably never
seen a phone that has any sort of
curvature in the display so it's it's
pretty remarkable to see for the first
time and then the novelty kind of fades
away speaker up here on the bottom we
have the charging port and a microphone
and the 3.5 millimeter headphone
Jack unlike the nexus one there's no two
microphones on the Nexus S for noise
cancellation so if you remember on the
nexus one here we had a microphone here
a microphone here to do noise
cancellation they didn't bring that
forward on the Nexus S turning over to
the back we've got the 5 megapixel
camera with flash doesn't do 720p HD
video oddly out of the box but I'm sure
that a software hack will come along in
the near future that will enable this
we've got a very fingerprint prone
background here are backing you've got
little dimpled dots but they're not
textured the back is completely flushed
completely smooth and it really picks up
fingerprints this device feels very it's
kind of almost too smooth like it's
going to slide out of your hand compared
to the nexus one which is a real solid
device we've got this interesting hump
back here which helps a little bit when
you're typing because you can rest your
middle finger there and sort of type
away and of course gingerbread has an
improved on-screen keyboard and we'll
talk about that in a future video so pop
off this back battery cover here and up
here is where you do that now some
interesting things to note back here
what is this this is the NFC sensor so
we have two contacts that connect with
this we have no microSD storage which is
really weird but OMS are not including
that but 16 gigabytes should be enough
for most people got a 1500 milliamp hour
battery so far is providing really good
battery life sim card holder I've got
the micro-sim adapter there because
we're using the iphone previously and
I'm using this on AT&amp;amp;T right now so I'm
not getting 3g data you're going to want
to put a tmobile sim in here if you want
to get tikka the full 3g data and
overall it's a relatively thin device
I've got to get the back on right here
it's not the thinnest it's definitely
not i think part of the reason that this
displays curved or part of the reason it
doesn't feel so so fin is because of the
curved display compared to say here is
the the Samsung Galaxy S or the
captivate on AT&amp;amp;T it is razor thin and
then it's got the flat glass obviously
but what the curved glass makes it seem
a little bit
thicker as you can see there and again
bringing all these devices in here these
are all pretty much the same devices the
Samsung Focus the AT&amp;amp;T captivate and the
Google Nexus S which one is the most
attractive looking at them on the table
hard to tell this kind of looks like an
unbranded nondescript phone whereas of
course you get the ATT branding and the
samsung branding kind of in-your-face on
the captivate and the focus definitely
the most interesting device is then that
is the nexus s because of the curved
display although from the view right now
you can't really tell I guess if we kind
of tilt them a little bit you may be
able to tell but probably not so overall
the Nexus S has some pretty slick
hardware I personally preferred the the
feel and the look of the original nexus
one it just had this sort of powerhouse
you know functional feel to it whereas
the Nexus S has gotten a little bit more
glamorous with the curved glass the
really shiny materials you know the lack
of buttons down here until you actually
turn on the device it doesn't seem as
friendly I guess you could say or as
approachable as the original Nexus Nexus
One but it's still quite a nice device
powerful fast the most important thing
here is that it's like a galaxy s which
is fast to begin with but it's not
running the TouchWiz interface so you
really get Android 2.3 and it's full
fast glory which is a great thing we're
going to do speed comparisons and
upcoming videos and talk a lot more
about Gingerbread and how it's different
than Froyo please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and check out
