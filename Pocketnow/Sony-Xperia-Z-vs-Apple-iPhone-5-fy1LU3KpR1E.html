competition like the iPhone 5 I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow
and this is a Sony Xperia Z versus the
Apple iPhone 5 aside from being very
high-end devices the Apple iPhone 5 and
the Sony Xperia Z have very little in
common they differ in size design
principle and operating system the way
Apple designs its mobile products is in
a way that the hardware simply melts
away when you use the devices and it's
all about simplicity when you pick up
the device for the very first time if
you've never used one before you already
know how the device works the way Sony
designed the Xperia Z and customized the
software really has nothing to do with
simplicity but more about the Sony
experience how your Xperia smartphone is
interoperable with your other Sony
products your PlayStation or your
PlayStation games and your television
first let's look at design where these
two devices actually have the most in
common sure the Xperia Z is much larger
than the iPhone 5 the iPhone 5 has a
4-inch display versus the 5-inch display
on the Xperia Z but when you look past
that both devices have a very similar
design they're squared they have hard
edges and relatively sharp corners the
Xperia Z's design however is a little
more like the iPhone 4 in the 4s in that
it has a glass panel on the front and
back of the device on the front it has
dragon trail glass and on the rear it
has a Gorilla Glass the iPhone 4 and the
iPhone 4s both had glass on the front
and back as well with the iPhone 5 Apple
moved to an anodized aluminum plate for
the back of the iPhone leaving only two
portions of glass on the rear one at the
bottom and one at the top for passing
radio signals so how do these two
devices fill in the hand the Xperia Z at
five inches is a lot more unwieldy and
it's hard edges make it a little hard to
grip and use one-handed if you hold the
device in your right hand the power
button press about at the base of your
thumb meaning you have to either stretch
your thumb down or adjust your grip to
reach it and the volume rocker is also
pretty difficult to reach as it rests
just below where your palm sits if you
hold the device with your right hand if
you switch over to your left hand the
volume rocker sits beneath your ring
finger or middle finger and the power
button is just above that and although
the Xperia Z feels very premium and
substantial it's not exactly comfortable
to hold and although the iPhone 5 has a
similar design in that the edges are
hard and sharp without a taper back it
feel
is much more comfortable in the hand
it's narrower smaller and fits in the
hand very easily all the buttons are
accessible using one hand and it's a
much more manageable device that said
the Xperia Z feels somewhat like a
larger iPhone so if Apple makes a larger
iPhone in the future
let's hope they opt for a new design
next let's take a look at what these two
devices have under the hood the older of
the two the iPhone 5 has a 4-inch Retina
display which is IPS LCD at a resolution
of 11 36 by 640 it also has an 8
megapixel camera comes in either 16 32
or 64 gigabytes of storage one gigabyte
of RAM a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core a6 chip
and roughly fourteen forty milliamp hour
battery
the Xperia Z on the other hand has a
more standard resolution display it's 5
inches diagonally with a pixel
resolution of 1920 by 1080 it has a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
chipset 16 gigabytes of built-in storage
with a micro SD card slot for expansion
2 gigabytes of RAM a 2330 million power
battery in a 13.1 megapixel camera so
both of these devices at least on paper
are extremely powerful the trick of the
Xperia Z sleeve however is waterproofing
it comes with ip55 and ip57 dust and
waterproofing meaning that it's
relatively safe from the elements that
also comes with its own caveat all of
the ports come covered so to plug up
your device to take out your microSD
card or to plug in headphones you'll
have to remove a cover first but how do
these specifications translate into
performance the iPhone 5 is notorious
for being extremely consistent and
performing really well it's great at
gaming and video playback and rarely
ever stutters on the home screen
switching between applications pulling
down notification shades it is really
hard to bog this thing down that's
partially due to the fact that it
doesn't do true multitasking and only
ever focuses on one single task still it
rarely ever stutters the quad-core
processor on the Xperia Z is a different
story it should be enough to power the
device without stuttering or any kind of
hiccups especially considered that it's
paired with project butter but it still
stutters on the home screen switching
between applications and all throughout
normal use it's very minor most people
probably wouldn't notice it but it's
impossible to miss if you have a keen
eye video playback in gaming is great
but these little hiccups and stutters
really take from the full experience
the display is arguably the most
important specification on a mobile
device it's your primary form of input
and output on a device such as a
smartphone the iPhone 5 is regarded as
having the most accurate display on the
market again the Xperia Z is the
opposite of that it's super saturates
colors and the contrast levels are
extremely low however the clarity of the
display at 1080p resolution makes video
playback pictures gaming and other
visuals noticeably clearer pictures and
videos all look a little more realistic
and true to life on the iPhones display
but the drawback is the size the iPhones
display is only 4 inches diagonally
versus the 5 inches on the Xperia Z so
you're getting an extra inch of display
and thanks to the Sony Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 on the Xperia Z the colors pop
a lot more in video playback and in
pictures once again it comes down to
accuracy versus clarity and super
saturation and in this case it comes
down to size as well so as far as
hardware goes both the iPhone 5 and the
Xperia Z are top in their class but both
exceptionally well-built and sturdy but
how do they fare in software let's take
a look
while it promises a few to no hiccups
and daily performance iOS is the iPhone
5s Achilles heel Apple really hasn't
updated the interface in many years and
it looks almost the same as it did when
the original iPhone launched only minor
things such as folders and wallpapers
have been added to the mix the
experience on the Xperia Z is very much
like the stock Android experience the
icons and the widgets are a little
different they're customized to Sony's
liking but the experience overall is
very stock light meaning these two
devices have very few similarities in
terms of software iOS is aging poorly
and Google is constantly innovating and
adding new features to Android the
Xperia Z comes with Android 4.1.2 so
it's not on the latest version of
Android unfortunately but it does have
all the features that were included in
the first jellybean update everything
from how you switch applications to how
you navigate the operating system is
totally different
the iPhone 5s home screen is very
rudimentary it consists of only folders
and icons and the only customization
outside of jailbreaking your device is
rearranging the order of icons and
folders or changing the wallpaper the
Xperia Z's interface however has widgets
icons folders and shortcuts all of which
can be rearranged in any order and
placed wherever you like Sony's custom
software also comes with the ability to
apply
themes which changes the accent color
system-wide it basically allows you to
customize the interface to your liking
this is one area where the Xperia Z has
a true advantage over the iPhone for
years now Apple's iPhones have been
regarded as having some of the most
popular and impressive smartphone
cameras only a few contenders have come
about in the past few years such as some
entries from Nokia and maybe the galaxy
s3 the Xperia Z however matches the
iPhone 5 almost exactly in image sensing
the iPhone 5 might have a little edge in
terms of detail and clarity but as far
as saturation color reproduction
contrast and brightness go they're
really on par with one another where the
Xperia Z truly has the advantage is in
software the level of customization a
number of features in the Xperia Z's
camera application is impressive while
Apple stock camera application really
only gives you the options for a grid
HDR panorama and flash on or off but
when you're outside in conditions where
the lighting is perfect or whether
you're inside where lighting is less
favorable both of these cameras operate
on a very similar level the 13.1
megapixel sensor in the Xperia Z doesn't
necessarily mean it has a better camera
for most of the shots I stepped it down
to 9 megapixels for the 16:9 aspect
ratio and some of the shots were shot at
either 12 or 13 megapixels and other
than the actual output size of these
photos the difference is negligible all
in all the Xperia Z and the iPhone 5 are
truly premium devices from Sony and
Apple the iPhone 5 has an advantage in
display quality but the size is a little
small for some on the other hand the
Xperia Z's display is larger and more
dense but as contrast is low and the
colors are super saturated the software
on the iPhone 5 is getting a little long
in the tooth whereas the Xperia Z runs
one of the most recent Android versions
and their camera performance is nearly
neck-and-neck so it really comes down to
preference in size and operating system
so that's all we have for you in this
comparison be sure to give it a thumbs
up if you liked it or found it helpful
