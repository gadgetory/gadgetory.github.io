good phone and with the 5s apples
improving the 5 in several key areas hey
guys it's Brandon Minnemann from pocket
now and in this video we're going to
unbox the iPhone 5s let's get to it
so the 5s versus the 5 improves upon
three areas one is biometric security
which early is an improvement it's an
addition number 2 is camera and the
camera on the previous generation the 5
was getting a little bit behind
especially in low-light photography when
compared to the Lumia 1020 the HTC One
even galaxy s4 and number three speed
we've got a 64-bit chip in here the
first 64-bit chip in a smart phone no
one early asked for a 64-bit chip in the
iPhone 5 because the 5 is already really
fast so we're really going to see some
improvements in gaming here with the
iPhone 5s there's actually kind of a
fourth area here and I think it's going
to be battery life the battery inside
the 5s is 10 percent bigger than the 5
to coupled with this 64-bit chip I think
you're going to see 10 to 20% battery
life improvement we're really not going
to go in here you know what's in here
we've got the ear pod headphones they
still have those we've got the lightning
connector let's take a look this is the
Space Gray version and I'm really
curious that as to how it looks how the
fingerprint scanner looks on the front
so taking off the front or the back
cover carefully really nice contrast
here between the gray and the black I
was hesitant to get the black because
last year's black really showed nicks
here in the corner but now we get a more
kind of a lighter finish here than last
year's model so taking off the front oh
yeah that's good stuff let's look at
this fingerprint sensor here so now the
home button is no longer a curve divot
it's this little flat mark and let's see
how that feels
umm it feels like a home button it it
really doesn't feel very much different
than the curved home button that we've
been used to for a really long time
other than
that you'll notice that the camera
sensor on the back is bigger we've got
the five on the left here to compare
with and you can see the actual little
camera mechanism is larger to capture
more light we've got the two-tone flash
which is super cool it can flash in a
thousand different combinations so the
depending on ambient light conditions
you might get a slightly warmer flash or
a cooler flash none of this really
bright white flash thing that happens
with all these devices that have LED
flashes Apple finally did something
about that problem and really beyond
that you don't get many differences
between this in the last generation
iPhone 5 now we're at quick I just want
to kind of use it for a minute to see if
I can tell any difference in terms of
speed again the iPhone 5 is already a
very fast phone but let's just move
around okay that was pretty snappy
although on the iPhone 5 it's just as
snappy again really where the 64-bit
processor is going to come into play
here is with gaming and when app
developers update their apps especially
the graphic intense games to take
advantage of 64-bit architecture so
that's the 5s handsome looking phone
very similar to to last year's can't
wait to mess around with the fingerprint
sensor and to take some pictures we've
got so much more coming up on the 5s and
drop us some questions if you have any
while we're doing the unboxing process
getting it set up and testing it for the
first time if you like this video please
shoot us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
