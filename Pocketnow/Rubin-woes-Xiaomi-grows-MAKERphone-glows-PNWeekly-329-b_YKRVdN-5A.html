the weekly brought to you by pocket now
next day developers on this day Friday
the 26th of October 2018 from Chevy's
busy week to Google's mishandling of
sexual misconduct claims it's a wide
world in mobile tech out there so we've
got to talk about all of it
I'm Jules Wong your host this week
Joshua is in China covering shall be but
we will hit hear from him later on in
the show talking about another topic
that we're actually looking forward to
joining us for this segment though our
two of our colleagues from XDA TK Bay
should be a familiar presence here
welcome to you sir Nate thank you guys I
have to be back actually and nice to see
you again Jules and I finally have you
back on with us for the first time is
Daniel Marchena hello to you hello
everyone right to be here so there has
been a lot of stuff that's happened this
week that isn't a mobile phone launch
we've had a very congested kind of three
weeks before with Google and Microsoft
and LG just a whole bunch of people but
oh yeah and then Huawei - you know and
Huawei raisers and oh yeah yes yeah yeah
extense will be able to talk more about
that with Nicole Scott in terms of what
shall we has done this week so stay
tuned for that and in the meantime I
hope that our listeners of years can
forgive some of the construction that's
been going on upstairs huh hey guys you
think that you got that chair fixed up
okay great thanks in any case do you
bear that in mind and apologies for that
we'll go on as usual I do want to start
with one of the elephants in the room
this week and it was something that I
kind of had to take a you know few
seconds the
as I was writing the story for this and
that was the New York Times reports and
not just Andy Rubin one of the
co-creators of Android but just a whole
bunch of the executives at Google who
were quietly paid off and they were
accused of sexual misconduct of just not
following procedures over there and just
it's it's it leaves a bad taste in your
mouth and in particular with a tearoom
it's not as if it's just he's just one
of the father figures of Android and
that's why we're talking about it's also
the fact that he was paid the most and
was you know permitted to leave his
influence have his reign at Google from
the time that Android got acquired in
2005 all the way to when he at the part
of the company in 2013 and even after
that Google had supported him in
creating his venture capital for him
playing playground global hmm as well as
his company essential for me this was
one of those things were you know you
hear about something that an artist did
that is horrible and reprehensible and
somehow you have to you know deal with
something you'd like the debate of do
you want to set can you separate the
artist from the arts can you separate
the work from the person that did it and
I want to know what you think what your
first blush is and I'm going to start
with Daniel on this one
yeah you know your sentiments I feel the
way that you do that it's hard to
separate the art from the artist you
know a lot of us see him as the father
of Android but you know if there were
just a lot of bad decisions made at
Google and I think that's coming to
light it's good that it's coming to
light especially with the Miche movement
and everything else that's going on
right now
you know but
you can't look at him the same way
anymore unfortunately and that's
difficult to do for me personally at
least why so I guess I I mean it's
almost obvious but I can talk it out I
think for me it part of the the issues
that I have is this was all right you
know to him to be other individuals at
Google who made these decisions to keep
this quiet to just kind of push it under
the rug and move him out I think it
shows to the kind of character
individual that he is you know he did
come out with his statement he's
claiming that none of this is true you
know then this is all just smearing in
advance of his custody battle going with
his uh his ex-wife or a future ex-wife
you know so there's definitely some
question and doubt throw in there but
you know Google said that it's been
confirmed and they viewed the
allegations against him as credible you
know so he not only made terrible
decisions but he continued to make
terrible decisions going forward and
there was all this background reporting
in the people that either are not
obviously or publicly did gave their
names out and said that this happened so
it's multiple people saying what they
say against what he says at this point
and that's something that it it's gonna
be challenging for his case here I want
to get to Tk here on this one just what
are your first takes on this so the the
story kind of just to me it was kind of
like uh I got caught out of you just out
of nowhere you know suddenly somebody
you've been I mean from free in many
ways he's done a lot of good things for
the community he's these I think he's
sensual as a company was a good company
on you know sad to say where it's going
now but the the level of I guess how
deep this thing went that's really the
shock value for me it wasn't it's the
fact that because I'm gonna say I'm not
desensitized to the cases there's a lot
of things going on and a lot of big you
know big names are basically peon broked
in things like this but you know just to
see and his
phonce is essentially very you know I'm
really shocked that they shared my
information not necessarily kind of
validating it's just a moment he segues
into that you know sharing specifics it
makes you just his statement feel less
credible so it's hard for me to believe
him when he makes a statement that at
the same time it says I didn't do it
oh and by the way I'm surprised they
shared my information the reality is
it's hard it's hard and and like Dan
said it's you you can't see him again in
the same light and this definitely has a
lot of impact on his career now because
as his name now is associated with this
it's hard to work with him some of the
behaviors that he has been claimed to
possess from co-workers he said they
have said that they he has called some
employees stupid or incompetence and
that when he was at the company for a
time he kept certain pornography on his
work computer and all that was given to
him in return was a docking in his bonus
for that year
yeah and had it been any low level
person at that company that would have
been a an immediate here's your box
here's your pink slip out the door yeah
as Google has been very permissive of
relationships in whatever form they take
even within the company itself if it's
between certain indirect subordinates
with they're not even people who they
report to and but the way that this has
been talked about it seems like you know
even though he has participated in
consensual relationships with these
people it's that he did disclose them
properly and that's what kind of pushed
him into the wrong with Google at the
very least but again all in the face of
this we've seen him gather up annual
compensations of at least 20 million
dollars yes past 2011 and
you know we see stock bonuses we see a
sweetheart loan for a Japanese Beach
estate and he was given a severance
package that was very very generous in
fact probably I believe the highest are
one of the highest that has been given
out and this was determined by Larry
Page by one of the cofounders of Google
and if it wasn't clear enough when Larry
Page learned of any misconduct that
ribbon took part in it should have been
made apparent what he and this is the
New York Times is reporting when he does
determined the severance pay for Reuben
there's yeah it it like I said it's a
bad it's not a good position to be and
not only to recognize that there's an
issue but that the way it was dealt with
it was almost like it you know it was
self-serving to a certain point which
should not have been that way and I
think my hope is that some silly that
they this actually does shed some light
and changes some of their policies so
that they don't get into that position
again
and they can hopefully find a way to
even I don't know how you come back from
that it's a tough position to be in it
from the company from from both their
sides not just him you know he's he's
not in there anymore but he did get paid
and they facilitated all the other
things that we saw from him after even
he on his way out like you said so it to
me it's a little bit hard and a sad day
for you know for most Android users I
mean because like I said he holds a very
high position for us and that's one of
the main key points about it is it's
hard when you see somebody you admire do
things like that I do I mean I want to
give this a cert the way it deserves but
I don't want to focus too much on it
because it's kind of somewhat you know
it's not really what we want to be able
to talk about here and now I'm signs you
know focusing on tech hardware but just
a wrap exactly mean word do you like how
badly how much of an impact does this
have on androids reputation or like at
least
the leadership like what will that have
it affects towards because we haven't
seen Google speak about this in fact the
top post other keyword blog is Android
celebrating its tenth adversarial yeah
yeah I want to read what Daniel thinks
you know I I think that this is a bigger
issue for Google you know then it might
be for Android you know unfortunately
we're seeing that especially in the me
to movement that it's not having a huge
effect on individuals themselves but
establishments are having issues and you
know this isn't something a one-off
thing for Google there have been a few
other individuals who have had
sweetheart deals have continued their
roles at Google after these kinds of
allegations of misconduct you know so I
definitely think that this is going to
affect Google more than it's going to
affect Android I think people who maybe
have been with Android since the very
beginning and know Reubens involvement
with it from the beginning they might be
a little bit affected but I don't really
think that it's much more than a speed
bump right now for Android as a whole
but Google I definitely think that this
is a warning sign of maybe something
worse that's coming up yeah do you think
the dissociation of Android and Google
when you know Samsung its Galaxy brain I
was about to say the exact same head
yeah the fragmentation of Google well
the fragmentation of Android amongst all
the different devices carriers OEM so on
it's ironic saving grace yeah it's at
the end for the most part people will
refer to it maybe they may call touch
you know call out to Google but at the
end of the day Android is in so many
different shapes and flavors and OMS and
devices and access of it I think in in
the whole I don't see this as an issue
for Android as an operating system for
anybody that has an Android phone is not
going to think about Andy word again
tech tech nerds or that the community
knows and understands who Andy is and
the average user may or may not even be
affected by it they're only going to
think about it is as Google effect so
you know it'll take time and like I said
it needs to be handled the right way and
truthfully and they need to have a good
plan so people can basically accept it
it's a tough one it yeah it is and I
shall move on to another topic yeah it's
just you know did something but I felt
like something had to be said about that
so I'm glad we did let's talk about
aptoide and third-party app stores
floors right in the meantime because we
just learned what we have we have one -
just remember yeah yeah yeah the XD apps
yeah download it and today we have just
learned this week of a ruling in
Portuguese courts that supports aptoide
and this claim that's the Google Play
protect security feature that's
associated with the Play Store and
whatnot has been detecting aptoide as a
risk to the users devices
yeah and in some cases has uninstalled
the app or has made it very very least
has made it very very hard to download
apps from aptoide for the sake it is
alleged of harming competition and
aptoide has said that it has affected at
least 2.2 million daily active users
which it has lost and the well we're
gonna have to see what happens at this
point to Google which is already facing
a whole bunch of mission exactly fines
so I want to know what your take is TK I
mean so I you have to look at it from
both sides right so from one end you
have to look at it from the the App
Store right or the Play Store versus
aptoide there are other you know Apple
or other stores that you can get
applications from so there's the xd8
other apps but for the most part Google
has never gone directly after other app
stores it essentially it hasn't tried to
infringe on them being not only site
loaded because you're downloading them
directly you're not downloading them
direct from the Google Play Store but
it's the I think it has to tie into the
whole Google Play protect right it's a
service that they're trying to say that
this protects your device gives you a
purity so from Google's and they're
saying look you're bringing in an app at
the store that's gonna be able to
download applications that I've not
verified by us so we can't guarantee
them and I think that's where it should
stop it should not go into the point of
saying look we're gonna remove it for
you and not only that we're gonna make
it very hard for you to use so I like
the the ruling I like the fact that it's
allowing third-party application stores
to reside and actually function as a as
a normal thing to update applications
push notifications and stuff like that
and I hope that this does not you know
give Google the the the permission to
say okay well we you know we're not
going to be able to protect your device
if you can download things from
third-party application stores and
that's not true if you need to know what
you're downloading that's number one you
are the the number one antivirus program
or meth method is the user because
you're the one who opens the door if you
can put as many you know locks on the
door but if you open that door all of
those locks are pointless so I'm happy
with the ruling I think it's something
that you know definitely will help the
community and could definitely help us
at down the road as well because as I
said ik see a store as well has other
applications that are intended for power
users that sometimes do things even more
than a standard app can that's how have
you been navigating your all of this
news lately with the Google's bundling
or doing whether it should bundle
certain services of its own yeah
personally I agree with dk stance on it
you know I think this ruling is good for
Android as a whole you know under the
auspice of you know the plate protect
why has an Amazon been removed from
certain you know inside the Amazon
Appstore hmm like we said at XDA we have
an app store that you can side load for
you know mods and things like that on
your phone why haven't we been stopped
or you know I know we've had problems in
the Play Store but what haven't what
we've been stopped from side loading and
stuff so it almost seems to me like this
was a directed attack against them to
remove them because this is a very big
application and Google's no doubt losing
money and you know share because of the
way that this was running and I haven't
seen anything as far as you know malware
being sprayed I haven't seen anything as
far as wares or
you know hacked paid applications being
spread through this out store again I
haven't really haven't used it myself
and nothing I've seen has mentioned that
so it's kind of weird that Google was
targeting them you know as far as the
other EU rulings I think it's gonna take
some time to really see where it's gonna
come down you know in the EU Google's
now gonna be charging for application
bundles based on the display density
size yep I think that's a really
dangerous road to go down I think it's
going to encourage smaller OEMs to split
off and kind of do their own deal so
time when we tell as far as that goes
but as far as this is I think this is a
good ruling to help keep Android open
and not wall it off to just you know
they said you've got to know what you're
downloading you got to know you're
putting on your device yeah especially
to that healing with and how Google is
reacting that I in terms of Licensing
out the use of Google apps to Android
OMS targeting the European market it
even wondering what the effects will be
because I mean will it impact how these
OMS bring over certain devices into
those markets or if anything will change
at all if how many is made will continue
to be made that way I was wondering if
either of you have any thoughts of that
so that one I'll I'll let you go first
and because I'm mindfully yeah am i can
get longer yeah yeah yeah I was actually
talking with some people about this
pretty in depth and that might have
somewhat of a doom and gloom perspective
on this you know but when you're
considering devices that only cost a
hundred or two hundred dollars yeah
another 10 15 20 dollars in pure loss
for these MEMS unless they're going to
increase their profits or increase their
prices that's a big hit we already know
they're not making a whole lot of money
on these low scale devices so they're
either gonna stop making these low scale
devices or what I think is they're gonna
start moving away from Google they're
gonna start offering third-party app
stores Waialae has them Samsung has them
Xiaomi has them they have their own app
stores
uh and a lot of the Google services it
can be accessed through PW A's
you know I mean you go to the Gmail
website on your phone it's not a whole
lot different than the Gmail application
on your phone you know so the Google
Maps website the Google Maps website on
the phone is very similar to the
application so what is Google really
offering by making them pay this
especially for those low-end devices um
you know again it could be just doom and
gloom but I think it's it's a scary look
to what could possibly be coming
especially on that low end well you
mentioned a progressive web apps and I'm
wondering whether or not KY OS might
have any sort of wedge into that which
Google is backing by the way so perhaps
that might be an up-and-coming maybe
factor and we'll wrap things up here
what TK yeah I mean then kind of summed
it up pretty nicely I think the fact is
there's a big market in Europe with mid
rangers and low-end devices that are
intended to be basically cost effective
it's hard to bring that in into an
ecosystem that's already there it's
gonna damage it and I think they missed
I think for the most part this may be a
leveraging point this may be just hey
this is how it's gonna impact you if you
kind of start going down that route with
us and I think it's just I'm hoping it's
just a scare tactic it may be just a
negotiation move that it does not impact
low-end devices but at the end of the
day
shameless plug if it does happen you
gotta keep in mind that there are other
stores there are other application
stores that could basically see this as
a very big very easy opportunity to jump
in manufacturers can release Android
without an actual Google Play services
installed we've seen it in the past
you can side load things on your own and
it all it's really doing is just
changing the interaction but will have
other options and other things that we
can do and people will find a way that's
that's the beauty of Android there's
always a way well there's some beauty in
that I would guess and another thing
that we could find beauty in perhaps is
the galaxy a8 s now in China this week
we just found out about the galaxy a 9s
and galaxy a 6s
you know they're decent galaxies a
mid-range too premium level kind of
things I think mediatek has been really
pushing this notion of a new premium or
you know more generic term of premium B
but in terms of the a8 S which has been
teased we're looking at bezel like
what's there are there any metals bezels
here is there's just curved glass a
curved display and there's practically I
think they're not even a not even room
for the selfie camera so what's going on
here well word is is that there's going
to be that vaunted pie-in-the-sky
innovation that we've been looking
forward to for a long time and that is
the hole in the display till our room
for the camera or at least well I guess
the my pie-in-the-sky thought would have
been to have the camera being able to
shoot through the deactivated activated
diodes that around the field of view
that would be my thought but what I mean
are you looking forward to this is this
something that will make it out of China
let's start with Daniel on this one yeah
I'm actually pretty excited about this
this to me this came out and over I
wasn't expecting to see it but one thing
to keep in mind
TK might remember it same thing with you
Jules uh back in 2015 I think it was
Samsung had the galaxy a5 and that was
the very first full metal body Samsung
phone and was actually the predecessor
to the body design that we actually saw
on the note 4 so this is something that
Samsung has done before they've tested
you know new designs on their a series
phones and I think this is something
that you know this might be them working
out the kinks in figuring out how it's
gonna work for the Galaxy S 10 I think
it's really cool
there's really no telling whether this
is going to be distracting or not you
know I definitely think if they do this
the camera has to be in the center but
if we know on Android Pi they have that
corner cutout as part of that developers
so maybe they know that something's
coming in the corner of displays you
know it could be distracting but it's
much better than notches especially when
you figure a notch is like the size of
the one on the pixel three hits but you
know I think this show me me mix three
gives us an alternative to that if you
don't want it you know hole cut out in
your display you've got a beautiful full
full display without having to get out
of it yeah sorry I had to yeah he called
it out I had to point out well guys they
deployed about the a 8s I think it's so
that it's a race to a TV I think it's
like we all want to have that bezel list
and the nicest design I think I think
Dan's right it's really going to be an
interesting design if they do go with it
that the the camera needs to be centered
I would love to actually see something
similar to the way you were describing
which is the ability to have it behind a
display and just as you want to use your
selfie camera
it activates the pixels in front of it
and suddenly we can see through and you
can compensate for that it's because
we're starting to see some tech behind
the display with the fingerprint sensor
so that could be the route coming down
the road but I'm more interested still
the fact of where is the rest of the you
know the earpiece are we talking bone
conduction here when everything is
already up there
yeah it's or or they are we because
nobody mentioned any kind of mechanical
things popping up with an earpiece it's
nice I think it's a good design will it
come out of China it's hard the a series
is generally it have not done very good
outside or at least in the US because we
don't usually get them here but I think
as a as a device I think it's a great
concept the s10 needs to have a design
change we can no longer do incrementals
anymore 2018 was the incremental 2010 or
well 2019 needs to be the new design so
that's that will be nice if they're able
to do that and not do a knotch
you're talking about mimics and the
essential phone have those razor thin
speakers yeah the order of their own so
they might not have to do bone
conduction I really hope they don't do
any kind of bone conduction going
forward with this it was hard to see
from those images yeah I was I'm
interested to see in those and
definitely I want to see some of the new
gestures we've seen in PI beta is on the
on the you know Samsung's UI interface I
think that would be really nice because
then you have that's all you need you
need really good gestures and this thing
is just gonna be heaven it'll be nice a
massive display and minimal intrusion
with the sensors in the front I'm
wondering how graphical cue I might be
affected if it's just gonna be that
constant displacement of this few diodes
not being there physically yeah it's
just gonna be okay well do we change the
notification bar or status bar entirely
they're just you know for me until a
little lozenge in a def itself which
renders too many for hostages at the
bottom of the display at least four
pixels well kind of like the mimics
designs right I mean back in the day
mimics it used to be on the bottom right
chin I think it's an interesting I mean
we've seen a couple of even Xiaomi this
movie this week as you guys have seen
that the slider option coming out on on
their device to try to keep the cameras
and the sensors behind they're hidden in
front of the display so we're seeing
more options definitely I'm hoping
something sticks and this looks
promising definitely we are one plus
sixty minus three days away I like to I
like to be able to fit that in because
that's just it is stupid but you know no
I know I know yeah but you can't do it
on the regular one it's only on the T
series right you can't
yeah exactly so I think there is some
good news to be shared here that is word
that perhaps Verizon will be able to not
sell it but at least accept it onto its
network without having to hassle it too
much so finally something that's allowed
on what's traditionally been a CDMA
network perhaps it's just going to be in
LTE only phone
Verizon has been doing more of those
recently even with its flip phones too
so well it'll be interesting to see
thoughts TKR this perhaps major
development for what less so that was a
big thing that three years people have
been wanting to do with oneplus devices
because you're getting the ability of
having a flexibility of a pixel device
or a Nexus device but it had much lower
price point and a lot of people wanted
to do it I think I think it's a win I
think oneplus is strategy this year from
having just basically the new well the
things will get announced on Monday but
short basically the the things coming
down on Monday if this is one of them
and it's true obviously that we're gonna
be able to use it I think it's amazing
I think razors on the same track they
just finally got their certification
yesterday we're seeing more GSM carriers
now that LTE bands can be added and then
they're basically using GS you know SIM
cards and that's what makes it very
flexible you no longer have to call
Verizon and switch between devices
especially if you're using the new new
chips so I think it's a very nice thing
I think oneplus is poised to be I'm
they're going to be very big in 2019 and
I think this is a very very apply a big
part for them the razor phone too bad
yeah I forgot about that thanks for
reminding me well that that one just
said it last night they do be certified
it passed yesterday yeah yeah which I
think it totally interesting and given
the recent controversy is about surprise
that every even talked about potentially
sim locking its phones again it's like
okay yeah what do we want to do here
what like how do we really feel about
fries and I'm wondering if you have any
thoughts towards just that Network
adversarial relationship Daniel yeah so
you know I think I said I think this is
fantastic
or oneplus and it's fantastic for
enthusiasts in general that we're gonna
start getting new devices on Verizon's
Network you know regarding the the CD a
CDMA capabilities of the network they're
actually phasing that out which is why
we're seeing LTE only devices come on I
think the HTC u11 was one of the first
devices Verizon sold that was non CDMA
and I think this is just the beginning
of that deluge of phones you know it's
important to remember that the phones
still do
have to be authorized by Verizon they
have to be voltage certified because
that is where they're you know emergency
calling has to go through voice over LTE
you know I think this is good for the
industry as a whole now that you'll be
able to go between carriers with the
same phone you know and not be you know
buy a Verizon version of a phone and
then buy a t-mobile version of a phone
or whatever and for people who have been
waiting for one plus device the one plus
six is a fantastic phone it has its
flaws yeah but then again it's you know
it's way cheaper than every single that
are phone on the market you know so I
think this is a very promising thing and
I think I think if oneplus can leverage
this properly and can really advertise
the heck out of this which they will
absolutely do I think they can open up
to a whole new audience that doesn't
want to spend $1000 on a pixel but still
wants the latest and greatest well the
one thing that keeps us tied to our
carriers as it is right now it's not
contracts but the equipment is
installment plans where you pay 24
months for a device and you have to stay
on the network otherwise that lump sum
becomes due immediately so you know and
perhaps we still need an unlocked market
for that in you know to some of the
companies credits here we do see them
offering more financing these days but
there are more risk-averse in terms of
this kind of market I would say so
interesting developments going on there
let's move on finally to this little fun
story I guess it's not it's not fun for
Ksenia Sobchak and I apologize if my
Russian is lacking here but she was at
the very least a Samsung brand
ambassador and when you're a brand
ambassador then the thing that you have
to do is be an ambassador and advocates
show off for the brand that you're
representing yep you have to represent
the brand
and it appears that in an appearance on
a talk show
the reality TV star
and politician was trying to hide the
fact that she was using an iPhone
instead of supposedly what she was
contracted to use probably a galaxy
phone and people were kind of yeah they
called her out on that there we see a
couple of shots of the TV program in
question on the story here which you can
access at pocketnow.com slash podcast
and yeah good luck she is being sued for
breach of contract and yeah 1.6 million
dollars the equivalent not something to
sneeze at here so no no quick ticks on
this would TK I you know it it's funny
cuz they obviously this is not the first
time we've seen things like that right I
mean I the moment like this I saw this
this article I was like I'm having a
flashback of mkbhd it's not you know
doing the screen grab of you know set
company's name and set phone being used
to post from but you know it is a job
right I mean especially you know
influencers and people that are in the
public eye are performing a you know a
service of sorts when you make an
agreement you really should make a good
point of using or honoring the agreement
or at least make it so that you have the
ability of using other devices is it
realistic though that they're going
after saying you know because it could
have been obviously you know maybe the
phone was broken maybe something
happened there's a lot of things why
people switch phones but is it really
justified I think it's just Samsung's
trying to make sure that you know
they're they're putting they're putting
their weight behind this one it's it's
it's comical and to say in the sense of
what's going in but it's it's very
serious in the amount of numbers that
they're talking obviously this is you
know very very serious I'm not trying to
belittle it but you know it's a it's a
thing if you're contracted to do
something you should have you know
carried that phone with you and you can
carry two phones it's not it's not bad
to carry you know two sometimes three
then help me out bro you know a lot of
phones it's not it's not bad
you can visually Oak has been lost on
our part yes yeah and you can see right
there you know it it's not uncommon so
it's it's sad to see but you know
hopefully hopefully people will learn
from this and we won't hear any more
about these things
I'm sorry listeners we're just we're
piling on do you know I think we hit
yeah yeah Daniel I mean TK I think has a
great point in terms of we don't know
every single detail about this issue and
that there might be mitigating factors
for the starting question here but and
how difficult it is is it to walk the
line especially when we don't have
tangible assessment of how well these
influencers do for the companies that
they are employed by beyond that list
right now but I have just split that one
point six between like three to four
companies because I can't carry one
seriously um you know and and honestly
this could be something as simple as you
know iMessage is hard to get out of and
a lot of people are hooked on it and you
know I don't know the nature for
agreement you know it's definitely
difficult for us to speculate to that um
you know so she might have been using it
to keep in contact with her family or
her producer or something like that and
there might be a viable reason for her
to using that but you know when she had
that contract you know she's hiding it
with a piece of paper so either she was
hiding it from the screen or she was
hiding it because she didn't want them
to see she was on her iPhone when she
when you're in public you've got to be
using the device that you know you've
been contracted to you you you shouldn't
be yelling and using other things but
you know like like you said before this
is a difficult thing to speculate on we
don't have all the details but you know
it's happened so many times before that
it's it's comical to see but it's
unfortunate in our situation that she
could stand to lose a lot of money
mr. yeah yeah well I mean that that's
something in the new media world that we
live in that kind of just it's where
there's thorns in the roads you could
say gentlemen I would like to thank you
for being part of the panel here for
this first part of the show but a very
very good pleasure having you hard
especially you Daniel for your first
time yeah thank you thank you yeah and
thank you TK as well we'll be getting
into some talk about chamois in just a
second with Nicole Scott of mobile geeks
right after you hear these messages the
PocketNow weekly is brought to you by

every day we hear something on the news
about a cyberattack sometimes it's just
a bunch of pranksters but more often
it's a foreign country with vast cyber

EDA Shelly has put in two major device
launches this week both flagship Android
phones in their own right once for tech
progressives and the other for the most
intense gamer it seems like the company
is cementing its place as a warrior the
Chinese market can't ignore as it caps
off a year growth and the stock offering
to don't forget about that joining us to
discuss all things made of millets
because apparently that's how you
translate that out Xiaomi is mobile geek
zone nicole scott who took time out of
her darn
Friday night to talk to me about this in
Taipei what are you doing here Nicole
you should be out drinking a little bit
and you know living it up and I'm not
gonna lie there might be some Japanese
whiskey during this podcast it's been a
good Friday night so far and this is a
pretty great way to kind of spend my
little 12:00 12:30 a.m. this is a great
way Friday night to be honest well I'm
glad that you're able to do that to you
it just had a little instant coffee a
little earlier and it was alright it was
decent so but forget about that because
who needs careful nothing like a good
Hibiki 12:00 so alright I'll take that
I'll take note of that and in the
meantime we shall talk about all things
shall be let's start off with the me mix
three that was just announced yesterday
the 25th at all places the Forbidden
City because if you want to be the best
and the biggest you have to go there and
you have to show things off and there's
a special forbidden palace edition of
the me mix 3 which is historically the
mix has been this bezel ously der it was
the first one the first phone that drove
down those bezels are made a attempt to
and then since then it's just been was
that the bandwagon that goes along with
it and now it's sort of doing its own
thing kinda not really also because it's
kind of fighting with Oppo so there's
that magnetic slider that they're doing
for to hide the cameras and there are
also a couple of other things like 10
gigabytes of RAM 5g we haven't really
heard much about they made a big point
about promoting that in the run-up to
this but we don't have the network's
just yet other than that it's just the
continuation of you know pushing those
edges just slightly slightly closer to
non-existence so I mean what's your
general take first of all of this the
mimics - I absolutely love them it may
have been the slipperiest phone in the
existence of phones
but it was beautiful and something that
probably shouldn't have been released to
the market only because it's so
difficult to make so the fact that they
went super limited production but
actually bothered to release it instead
of just saying like hey this is a
showcase phone like already that was
hats off to the me mix line but with the
two but with the three I feel like this
one I could actually go wide I mean that
kind of slider for the camera because
Oppo did it it doesn't necessarily mean
that it's like not unique it's just I
think Xiaomi is not ready to go like
full production with that and kind of go
wide so I think this will be the first
me mix that maybe more people can get
than just those who are lucky in China
it's kind of inflection point in some
way because the industry has already
gone full production mass production on
their own kind of you know I mean we
talked about the notch as much as we
want as well as like the chin and
everything else but like that is the
form factor that really allows for those
bezels to be reduced as much as they are
already even the pair to want 2017 like
that's it's a very very stark difference
I'm wondering in terms of just being
able to carry on that theme of you know
wider availability like does this where
does it really compare because Oppo
released its find X it's kind of the
high-end super powerful
you know motorized thing with the slider
and this is just magnets so you can just
you know slide it in and out like is
where do you think this will land in
terms of the psyche of the Chinese
consumer so when you look at the find
and you look at the me mix I personally
feel a little more secure in grabbing
the Xiaomi only because I'm a woman who
destroys handsets like I crack every
fourth pretty much that I get even
though I'm careful all right I really
try to be but this motorized component
that goes up and down I just think to
myself I'm gonna break that for sure I'm
gonna have a drop that I'm gonna I'm
gonna break that at least what if it's
like a physical slider that you're like
and it's good for 300,000
which to me seems low like if you look
at everybody who's made a video they're
all like look at this right and it's
like they're they're all showing off
with the flicking so I think that their
phone would have gone through at least a
hundred thousand before they left
Beijing do this better than you can
listen to that listen to that you think
you can just see it like we make videos
so we know how many outtakes there are
on that clicking oh boy alright so for
me
300,000 seems like maybe that's a little
maybe a conservative number they say a
few years but I don't know I take a lot
of selfies and I think a lot of people
take a lot of selfies but I think that
the like the magnetic mechanism seems
like a more durable more realistic kind
of iteration of that kind of bezel this
enablement like more so than like a me I
don't know that's me I mean that's
totally fair and it's not like you know
you're paying $1,200 for this you're
paying the thing is 30 or 300 ish in
turn easier and so that's roughly five
six hundred and this goes within
shammies ethos of not I believe it was
their Indian division that talked about
this it was like okay we're never going
to release a $700 phone unless the
technology is there for it if we can
pioneer on this without compromising and
I'm wondering if this is it does it does
it how strongly the me mix three is able
to keep up on that because there is a
little bit of creep in there like it's
not 2500 it's 30 it's in the three
thousands you know I think that people
are less and less willing to drop a
thousand dollars on the phone especially
we need to add like the higher
specifications it's even more I think
that we've kind of reached our limit
even though everyone says you know yeah
we can definitely you know that market
is still growing but when people ask me
for advice most of the people that
talked to me on like are like 500
700 the few that are willing to spend a
thousand are only those that are like
very device specific like said like the
note 9 or they just can't leave Apple
right like though those those are the
only two so in my heart of hearts I feel
like we've probably maybe seen the limit
of that thousand dollars to the five to
seven hundred dollar range is where
we're gonna be seeing a lot more people
so I think it's still fine and honestly
the hardware is evolved to a point where
the difference between 500 and 7.75
hundred and a thousand dollars is so
small right it's so small that you need
to just love new features and love like
getting a new phone like you have the
habit and you can't get rid of it I'm
just not sure that the average person
now will want to extend like longer like
we're seeing upgrade happen every two
years now instead of like 14 months so I
think I don't know I think there's
definitely a place for like not at the
absolute best but pretty close but not a
thousand dollars I mean when you're
picking a lot of services I mean Xiaomi
makes it oh you know the bulk of its
revenue and services but when you're
paying a lot of services that you know
these cute price points of $9.99 or a
hundred bucks for the service plan for
the cellular connection is it's just it
doesn't really make sense to be able to
justify that difference if all things
considered everything is the same so I
mean that's a fair point to make I do
want to move on to their newest
subsidiary black shark and earlier this
week they just launched the black shark
helo which is the second phone that
they've launched this year just in total
but both this year and in total it's
just amazing how first of all the gaming
niche continues to consume the attention
of a lot of more you focused I would say
brands and there's just something that
weeks of out doing razor
like okay so razor phone - there's this
RGB crow that's for the try snake logo
and then oh now they're just gonna apply
it to the shark logo and then we have
these spoilers and they're going to be
gradiated so you can flow patterns on it
it's gonna be great and there's a whole
bunch of other stuff too that you could
totally get into but I just wanted to
get your sense of how you know
especially in the Chinese market where
there are your gaming is just life
almost how you think this compares or in
how you think what your perspective is
so there's an interesting statistic I'm
sorry for the there's a little bit of
whiskey involved okay no I I have to I
have to see the quest key I need a
little whiskey you know whiskey so
there's an interesting statistic about
China that I love to ponder every once
in a while and it's that coming up to
2020 there's going to be over 300
million single men in China because of
the one-child policy and they've you
know made changes to correct this but
it's still a cultural kind of bear but
we're also just gonna see this
population mass come up that they can't
do anything about now right I mean they
can open up their borders which they
have done a little bit to deal with it
but eSports and gaming is the primary
way that I see the Chinese government
controlling this massive amount of
single men who are turning 18 eSports
and gaming so we can definitely see the
need for a gaming phone in a market
that's emerging for predominantly young
men who may be a little uncomfortable
around women lately all your I do is get
all the women to again to the stadium -
and then everything I guess mate that
she didn't ping might consider that
harmonious this is this is the
difference you less than normal so like
having this you know like nicely
controlled digital kind of Haven of
online gaming that they can create
specific events around and have an
online community that's like really male
focused I think it's perfect for this
type of on-the-go device because the
markets emerge to a point where
smartphones are now Purpose Driven it's
no longer like which is the best phone
it's like which is the best phone for
you
like which phone is the one that
actually speaks to your needs and I
think we're so lucky to be at this point
now that we can stop focusing on my new
technical innovation like bezel size and
focus on the real point of the smart
phone what can it do to enrich my life
and when you can like when you're
conscious enough of who you are to be
able to define what you need that's like
a that's a second question altogether
that I tend to like therapy people
through when they ask me for smart phone
advice now so once you kind of get past
that then you can kind of say okay this
is the right phone for me and I think
it's great that we're finally there and
not just like okay if you want good you
know battery life or all day or camera I
mean everything's now kind of good
enough where you can honestly start to
ask that question like what do I need
for a smartphone and for the China
market there's a massive need for a
gaming phone yeah yeah and I think a
good example of what you just pointed
out there is I mean it's more than just
about the specs it's more than just
about having 10 gigs of ram on it it's
about being able to utilize some of the
latest the biggest buzz words like AI if
you're able to this this phone is being
touted with a feature that allows it to
record like a big moments its able to
detect like oh you're going in for a
major kill it's able to record 10
seconds around that moment and then you
can choose to share it on Weibo or
wherever that you would like to share it
on like it's anticipating those needs
and I feel like that is going to be
something that is going to put the helo
or whatever else a step above another so
I mean yeah I think you have it right on
the mark in terms of that
so do you have anything I guess in terms
of as a reflection of perhaps just what
Xiaomi is able to do with this category
so I show me has still so much potential
and I think as a company a really solid
vision they just have had such a strong
ability to create ecosystems in inside
of China and people have criticized it
but at the same time like one of the
reasons why I live in Taipei and why I'm
so interested in going to Shenzhen is to
seeing all of this like hey we're making
it we're doing it what I mean oh wait we
should figure out what people think
about it oh right okay cool right
there's this like huge just passion to
do and they've been able to harness that
through their stores because they just
don't sell their own devices they sell a
whole bunch of other stuff and it's kind
of allowed this really interesting array
of products to the Chinese consumer in a
like much more entertaining way than
we've you retail so for me Xiaomi as a
company they're smart to like their
smartphone division is just like one
small part of like an overall plan for
how people live yeah so I'm still super
onboard shopping well I mean totally
especially that drive that they have I
mean talk about this year they opened up
the first 24-hour media store in Russia
of all places because that's a major
market that they kind of have said
synergies is not really the word for it
but you know sympathies are something
like there's like the Russian market is
just huge and open and it's physically
so close to China as well there's a lot
going for it they're just what their
physical closeness and I believe like
they're they're sort of eking its Lunden
somehow and you know all the rest of
europe and eurasia and then there is
also the fact that there are really just
a manufacturer at least you know they're
not qua
in the sense that they're under
investigation for so many of these
telecom you know spying kind of
accusations scandals yes so they're kind
of in a unique role they're in a unique
position here to be able to be a Chinese
company but not have a Spectre over them
so where do you think this goes on as
you know after the IPO after everything
else where do you think this goes in
terms of 2019 and perhaps beyond in all
honesty I think Xiaomi has stronger
brand recognition but Oppo has a
slightly better position for like more
accepted government release like Xiaomi
still has a lot of controversy around
patent infringement like and that's been
one of the highly talked about things
over the past two years about why they
haven't entered into Europe and I don't
know how much all of that will actually
come into play because everybody seems
to be descending on London as like that
hahaha brexit said maybe this is going
to play in favor of my corporate taxes
right yeah and just like there's there's
definitely this really like every
everybody's moving in in in into London
I mean even Huawei's headquarters have
moved from Germany into London OPO
setting at or where my plus is setting
up there there seems to be this huge
outflux from Europe that I'm not fully
up-to-date on but at the same time I
think it's interesting that Xiaomi is
making a play at the same time as other
all these other other manufacturers and
I I think they'll be able to pull
something off because of the shop that I
talked about earlier and a lot of these
partners have actually figured out how
to distribute into Europe so I think
that they have a strong network that
they could leverage off of because of
the ecosystem that they've they built in
China well I mean last I looked and
they're a public offering I don't think
there were any Chinese by banks floating
it so that could ease some suspicions at
least from the foreign and and then
there's also you know the the rumors the
ginning up of talking about hey sham
he's gonna be in the united states
sometime late next year late this year
or early next year and everyone's you
know this has been one of the hot potter
companies that we've been looking
forward to if there was any Chinese
entity to enter into the u.s. well we've
seen Huawei come in and blow up and then
you know now it's perhaps shammies turn
to Brad maybe right that ship or
whatever the fates might have in store
for them so yeah we'll see I do want to
throw you a curveball here and talk
about just a little bit about the HTC
Exodus 1 which blockchain found we're
gonna talk about that for just a little
bit as far as I know this is really just
HTC u12 plus but with a more emphasis on
crypto that's pretty much it you can
only buy it with cryptocurrency 0.15
Bitcoin which if I do the quick
conversion on Google it tells me that
it's $960 so I guess that's to be
expected I'm not sure if it's fair but
it's to be expected
and for the most part it's just a lot of
the same specifications but you have
more wallets you have more access to the
nodes and what and there wasn't really
too much talk about this original vision
vision excuse me of this the idea of you
know how this is a whole new entire
block chain Network because each phone
will be a node and whatnot so thoughts
on this just for a quick second
so very interestingly I have I'm based
in Taiwan HTC is a Taiwanese company
here's some backstory that I think will
frame this phone perfectly Taiwan is in
a country right China says you recognize
China or you recognize Taiwan Taiwan's
technically on a country one of my
biggest Bane's of existence here is
international banking because the banks
don't actually have the same guarantees
because it's not an actual country right
so the bank the International Banking
Association you know that doesn't it's
just not as easy politically politically
and so the banks have have had
international challenges for as long as
Taiwan us has existed and two years ago
now the founder of etherium actually
released a theory I'm to here no last
year I think it was last year released a
theorem to at a conference here because
Taiwan is looking to become a major
crypto hub like to actually set up
government everyone talks about
Singapore and all these other places is
being really progressive but Taiwan is
literally looking to how to secure its
money against a Chinese invasion this is
something politically that with the
Trump government has become a lot more
present in like the countries thoughts
and HTC as a you know Taiwanese company
who is 100% therefore all of Taiwan's
needs and is wonderful in that and that
aspect I think that this is a reaction
to what's happening here in Taiwan
politically so to come out with a foam
that really embraces crypto
as like a base concept right for like a
society and an ecosystem and like all of
these things that would be more secure
than potentially what Taiwan has right
now I'm not saying that this is what
their vision is of it but I'm saying
that I think that this is a result of
the political situation here in the
country yeah especially after the
inauguration the election and
inauguration of President
sorry when of the Democratic Progressive
Party she has been kind of you know
treading water more with Beijing and
it's just been you know it's a little
Arnott so it's kind of both a
happenstance that you know blockchain
technology is developing at the same
time that these tensions grow crater so
yeah I think I think you were being very
polite when you said treading water she
was actually the Taiwanese ambassador to
China so she was in Beijing for many
years and she was known as a hard-ass
beep in order to deal with like she she
doesn't you know she doesn't her and her
stance is not that Taiwan will rejoin
China which is very interesting during
this kind of time when the US has backed
Taiwan and now it's a total pod well now
it's it's not just that you know
diplomatic relationship she is now the
figurehead of this so-called renegade
province so it's gonna be especially
interesting how the next few years will
navigate so definitely a key factor in
you know seeing HDC come out with this
that may have not been the tech angle
you were looking for but that was the
angle that most I wanted to share oh
yeah I mean even in spite of HTC is kind
of financially treading water it's kind
of still trying its best to gather
something up and then perhaps look into
the future a little bit so I mean I've
always my brother is still considering
HTC u12 for purchase I hope that they're
great phones though oh yeah they're
great hardware the softer the software
as last I heard was still decent if not
just a little bit long in the tooth but
it's just the fact that you know how
much can I guarantee him that okay is
this a really a good investment are you
going to get good service from a company
that's is this deep in
they're mud so yeah like my my my
phone's haptic feedback or like the
squeeze functions I didn't have any
problems with mine but I held my review
until everyone got their updates and I
felt like it was a more even footing
ground because I thought my phone worked
really good but it still made me
hesitant to recommend it when so many
people were having issues with it and
it's such a cool feature and when it
when it when it misfires it's like you
want to throw your phone against the
ground it's definitely one of those
things where you're like I love it but
do I do I want to like hate it because
he would hate it it was wrong
trust me $1,000 phone is not something
to play hot tomato with so yeah agreed
agreed yeah well on that note I think we
should let you enjoy your Friday night a
little bit more so right Nicole Scott
mobile geeks we love you thank you so
much thank you
the PocketNow weekly is also supported
by one plus that one plus 60 launches in
just a few days
tickets to the events sold out quickly
but you can watch it live on October 29
and 11:00 a.m. Eastern in front wherever
you are just go to pocketnow.com slash 1
plus 60 for more info oh hi my name is
Albert I'm 20 and the year and a half
ago I launched a Kickstarter campaign
for Maker we know an educational gaming
device thanks to our amazing help we
produce thousands of Maker Beunos and
turned our passion and hobbies into
something more after collecting feedback
from hundreds of maker bruno supporters
we'll come up with something completely
new meets maker phone we are talking
with one of the main people behind what
is called the maker phone a project that
is up on Kickstarter right now that has
grossed over 185 thousand dollars about
yeah yeah it's up there I have that I
have the so yeah my name is Albert gosh
IKEA so I'm the creator of microphone
and actually I'm the co-founder of the
startup we make her phone the startup is
called circuit mess and the name it
actually comes from two words circuit
because you know that's what we do we
make circuits and mess because our
company is in a mess so we figured out
it's a great thing for our startup so
yeah I'm actually 20 and I founded my
company when I was in high school so on
4th grade of high school I started the
Kickstarter campaign for maker bueno and
that was our first project so maker
bueno basically is do-it-yourself gaming
device and the first crowdfunding
campaign it raised over $100,000 when
fulfilled all of maker Reno's continued
selling them and started working on a
new project that we have currently
launched 12 days ago and yeah we're
already over one hundred and eighty-five
thousand dollars yeah it's it's actually
selling pretty well so yeah yeah well
first of all the way graduations on that
oh sorry yeah yeah thank you so yeah I
just wanted to mention that yeah besides
me and this little startup there's also
seven people seven people working in it
and it all started a year and a half ago
and currently we're a small team based
here in Croatia you know creates a small
country in Europe you know it with some
World Cup this year in the finals so
you've probably you probably heard about
it now yeah but before that nobody knew
where it was so yeah well I mean you
just mentioned a little while ago that
you are your twenty first of all so I'm
I'm already feeling a little bit older
but the question that I have is like so
coming from coming from this younger
generation like what inspired you to
take a look at what could be considered
sort of a throwback we'll get into the
product we'll get into the product in a
little bit but obviously you know I have
like a Google pixel 3 right here on the
table and we have all of these really
advanced smartphones what what was the
impetus of this particular maker phone
product
yeah that's that's uh that's a tough
question so actually microphone it
our main goal was not to make something
retro you know I mean retro which
certainly is becoming increasingly
popular with you know stuff like NES
mini or PlayStation mini and stuff like
that so retro it's all over the place
right now but actually when I started
with Maker we know I made the first
prototype six years ago and actually it
was inspired by this whole maker
movement so I'm actually I was born in
98 so I'm actually the PlayStation 2
generation so I was playing PlayStation
2 and yeah I actually I wasn't playing
pixel art games and stuff like that when
I was young I mean pixel art they
weren't called pixel art games back then
they were just called games yeah yeah I
actually I actually do not recall
Pokemon or stuff like that being planned
but what actually inspired this whole
project was this maker movement and in
the couple of in a few past years it
became you know increasingly popular
just like retro became popular and you
know maker movement people building
stuff in their homes buying 3d printers
printing I don't know stuff and you know
playing with Arduinos and you know I
just I jumped on that hole maker trays
when I was 11 or so and I figured out
that you know it's number one it's it's
really fun you know I really like
building stuff and I still love building
stuff and that's why I started this
whole business and the second reason why
we actually started with maker we a
maker phone was that we saw a huge
potential in this market so currently
education stem makers stuff like that
it's becoming increasingly popular and
this whole educational in maker market
it's just it's growing and because of
that we saw that you know a product like
this really you know can make some kind
of an impact on the market so that was
actually the primary motivation and the
whole retro aspect of the device it
actually
it was it games like some kind of side
effect because if you want to make a
phone that a person can assemble by its
own cans you know you cannot make it
super complex it cannot run the latest
version of Android it needs to be retro
it needs to tell a processor that runs
pixel art see you know sprites and has
128 by 160 pixels because first of all
we didn't want to make it super
expensive we wanted to make device
that's going to educate people not
compete with motor flagships and second
of all we wanted to make it simple so
yeah retro it actually came as a side
effect but you know it's also a selling
point of our product now because people
are actually remembering space invaders
and stuff like that they were going go
on those II expect rooms and stuff like
that so oh yeah definitely so yeah I
guess that's the answer
oh yeah definitely and I think that I
think the retro aspect does does does
really well to sort of it's sort of like
cell marketing in a way because a lot of
people might look at this kind of device
and think wow that's that's a bit of a
throwback and I really like that as you
said retro was really in right now but
at the same time like you said you
didn't want to make a device that was
too complicated so there are a couple of
different tiers on this and I would
implore everybody to check out the
Kickstarter page really get to know this
product cuz it's it's honestly really
really cool and it is really affordable
I mean I'm looking at this now and a
fully assembled one is an option so you
can just get straight into the device
but if you want to actually make it
there's an educational aspect to this
what comes with that particular kit and
how much experience would someone have
to have with let's say soldering because
I saw that picture and I'm intimidated
by something like that just from the
outside okay yeah so what comes in the
kit is actually we have several
conversions as you said we have a
standard kit we in which you get the box
with you know all the components that
the phone needs in order to work we also
have an assembled version because we
understand that some people are
intimidated by the you know assembly
process and are not real
quinta soldering so we offered that as a
version 2 because they only want to go
and the third version is the tools back
where you also get you know all the all
the tools that you need for the assembly
as well as the kit so in the basic kit
yeah you get the components and you need
to assemble it and the skill level that
actually the age limit that we recommend
is 11 plus so this device certainly you
could assemble it I guess it's your 11
plus and this so yeah that's basically
as there's the age limit the skill level
we say and claim that if you have no
skill whatever in this field of
electronics and programming and you know
soldering we can teach you using our
internet tutorials so everything that
you need to have is the tools and some
enthusiasm and interest in technology
and we're going to teach everything else
so it may look complex but actually this
kit this mobile phone you do not
assemble all the parts on it so on the
front page on the front side of the
mobile phone you have these big modules
for example I don't know if you're
looking at our listing right now but for
example we have this diagram with nine
parts so there's like nine basic parts
this big red PCB the circuit board you
can screen module on amplifier module
here the sound player module the main
microprocessor and stuff like that the
big big parts like push buttons so you
only need to solder and assemble the big
part and you also have some tiny
components on the back side of the PCB
of the circuit board which come already
Prius priests orders so the reason
behind this is some of those components
that are on the back
you really cannot buy them in a package
big enough for an you know average
person for an average person to solder
it on the back and also if we made the
phone fully DIY so if you were
assembling
single-component at the phone it will
probably be as big as a table so that's
the reason why we yeah so it would be
pretty you know pretty clunky you know
and it's it's already pretty clunky so I
think it would be too clunky so that's
the reason why anyone can assemble it
because basically you're assembling the
phone but you're not really assembling
all the tiny components you're just you
know putting the basics on it and
soldering but through this process of
assembling your phone we're trying to
teach you all the basics for example
soldering and explain you how an actual
phone works for example our guide it's
it's not it's not like I kiyose a build
guide where they show you where he put
the screws and that's it we're trying to
educate people just like with makeup we
know and tell them okay this is the
micro computer it's used for this and
that so this is a resistor you put it
here because of this so yeah that's the
there's the whole point of the device
yeah and I'm sure people will be able to
see in the Kickstarter page but if
anyone is is thinking about it this
phone will be able to make it has a GSM
radio even Wi-Fi and even Bluetooth that
kind of surprised me as well I thought
that was really awesome so it there will
be a lot of those functions right out of
the box but I guess where I want to go
next here is obviously the hardware is a
big focus of the maker phone um what can
you say and share with our listeners and
viewers about the software experience
because clearly there's a learning
experience behind that as well okay yes
of software yeah actually emphasis was
on the hardware but we're not just
selling hardware we're not just creating
harder hardware and what we're trying to
make is this database of tutorials and
educational material and content and
software that is going to be used for
the maker form we skip something like
that already developed for maker we know
we call it the creations gallery and
basically it's a gallery of video games
that users have made and on maker we
know we already allowed people to create
their own games and share it in our
creations gallery and with maker 4 we're
trying to
this up a bit a little bit and yeah the
whole point is that you can connect your
microphone to your PC just after
assemble it and you can code it in three
main languages in scratch in Python and
in Arduino which is basically C and C++
and what we're trying to do with this is
we segmented this learning process in
two levels we actually have this shout
on a graphic in our page so we're trying
to get people into coding we scratch and
for those who do not know what scratch
is it's the most basic programming
language that is nowadays used in
educational institutions worldwide
basically it's it's it's a window with
blocks that you need to put together and
you know form code and it's really great
because with just two blocks of code you
can make something you can write hello
world on your phone and you can actually
see something happening and the second
the second level is PI phone and it's an
increasingly popular language and
actually the creator of Python
he created the language in order to
allow people that are not engineers and
programmers to get into coding so it's
you know it doesn't have a variable
allocation and stuff like that so it's
pretty straightforward for someone to
get into textual coding and the final
level is Arduino with is which is
basically C and C++ and it's actually a
pretty strong language is pretty
powerful and you can code actual
software for example video games in in
unity and easily swap to c-sharp after
that level so yeah that that's the whole
point of maker phone and what we're
actually trying to do is wrap all this
up in what we call the circuit miss
world in circuit miss world it's
actually a big hub for all these
creations tutorials and software that we
and users are creating for the
microphone and we're also going to you
know
we're also going to offer maker Windows
tutorials there as well oh that's great
so coming from maker bueno - now this
month's maker phone there have been a
lot of Arduino Kickstarter campaigns
that have been successful obviously
yours is the most DIY of the bunch
oh did you did you see any of those
other crowdfunding campaigns like what
did you learn from all of those that you
brought into this particular campaign
which is already wildly successful yes
so what we're actually asking is if I've
seen other similar campaigns yes do we
know campaigns and so yeah of course I
mean we were it's a it's a bad term but
we were stalking other campaigns and
other products and you know business
developers they usually call it
marketing analysis so we were doing a
marketing analysis and looking at our
Kickstarter that other Kickstarter
campaigns and similar products and so
far this is the this is the first DIY
phone in in this form there were some
other DIY phones on the market and
people usually when we when we show this
to an average consumer they usually say
oh this is like Google's Project ara and
this is like phonebloks and this it was
already made so I would like to point
out that maker phone it's not phonebloks
reimagined cellphone blocks it was
trying to substitute your iPhone your
Samsung Galaxy it was trying to compete
with flagships this is purely an
educational device and it's not going to
replace your iPhone and about Arduino
and maker projects yeah I agree that
there's an increasing an increasing
number of them appearing on on the
market and on Kickstarter only indiegogo
all similar campaigns but I think that
we are actually the first one to make a
device in this form factor and what I
actually think about all these and you
know you can't really generalize it but
most of those Arduino kits and boards
and development kits that appear in the
market I think that they are just boring
because you have a ton of devices that
are tiny robots on freewheels that you
assemble and when you show that to
someone it's just you know it's boring
and with this thing we're trying to
bring this whole maker idea and the DIY
aspects to a broader audience we're
going we're trying to appeal to a
mainstream audience because a mobile
phone everybody knows what the mobile
phone is everybody has one and when you
give them this kit when you give this
kid to a child then the child it's not
learning how to solder because you tell
the child it's good the child is
learning how to solder because it wants
to make this supercool mobile phone
which plays games which you know runs
apps which does some mp3 files and stuff
like that so there is this end goal and
that's what we're trying to do this so
basically what we invented here is okay
invented these are strong words so
basically what we're where we innovated
here is this crossover of mainstream so
mobile phones and DIY so that's what
we've connected because this is yet
another DIY kit and there's a ton of
that and the the only thing that we how
we differ from the competition is with
this whole mainstream plus they're white
kids crossover idea I love that I love I
love that you kind of give that idea of
the incentive of learning how to do all
of these things because that's that's a
real thing like we're being told all the
time these days that coding is really
important everyone can learn to code
everyone should learn to code but then
not a lot of people can answer the
question well what am I going to do with
it
so yes correct I mean with maker blue
you know we actually tried to make the
same thing we were doing festive
workshops before we actually decided to
make a Kickstarter campaign and kids
they they just love the idea of making
their own consoles because
that way you didn't have to explain them
you know coding is useful a kid
it really doesn't care if coding is
useful it cares about this super cool
game console that plays games the same
the same stories with microphone yeah
that's awesome okay so what are the what
are the overarching goals for something
like this I don't want to go so far as
to say well make your phone bring you
into a place where you can make like
like a maker smartphone or something
like that because obviously that would
over complicate things and you like you
said you don't want to do that but what
are the general goals for this
particular product you said educational
is there gonna be some sort of like
consumer aspect to it that goes beyond
the DIY aspect are you looking to create
products in the future based upon all
this okay so our big goal the big
picture how we see it you know we are
started we exist for a year and a half
and that's really not so much time so
stuff is changing so quickly that
sometimes you know we really do not know
how the company is going to look like in
six months we really cannot predict in
which way our growth is going to go but
how how we see it currently we really
want to stay in this educational market
and the DIY maker market for some time
because we see a huge potential as I
said earlier I think that STEM education
and educational toys and stuff like that
it's a it's a huge growing market that's
just expanding and what we are trying to
do is a series of DIY maker products
that are going to bring technology bring
engineering bring coding to the masses
in a fun and interesting way there's a
story behind maker up we know there's a
story behind maker phone we're actually
trying to connect mainstream with DIY
with our products and we're trying to do
it in different ways some short-term
plans would be currently our kids
they're all 11 plus because it includes
they they include soldering and
soldering sometimes it intimidates
people it's not suitable
for young children and what we would
really like to do is design kids
versions of maker we know and make your
phone that are going to be less complex
that you're going to be made of snap-on
components that you put together and you
need to you do not need to solder where
we actually want to make a series of
products that are going to appeal to
different age limits so something for a
bit younger children something for a bit
older children and we are trying to make
kids that are going to be in different
price ranges for example they're going
to make something a bit more expensive
than maker phones some premium products
and I think that we really want to make
something is being is going to be a bit
cheaper and the whole story behind this
is we're building this brand circuit
mess our company name we are going to
shut down maker Beno calm and forward it
to circuit mez calm and you're going to
unite all our products that we're
currently working on under this name so
that's the big picture where we want to
go and we'll see maybe maybe we'll be
selling toothbrushes on Amazon we'll see
how that goes
Oh that'll be great yeah I think that'd
be awesome and I can see a lot of
general consumers finding things to love
about this I mean this it just for all
of our listeners and viewers think of it
this way there's this is a phone that is
under $200 it has a headphone jack and a
dedicated deck so think yeah it's a
feature also it has eight notification
lights I don't know if you've seen so I
just I was looking at earlier that's so
cool yeah you know nowadays everyone's
competing with number of cameras and
we're competing with a number of
flashlights so mm-hmm aid notification
lights I could see myself using this as
that apparatus for education I have no
coding experience very little I should
say but I also have even less electrical
experience when it comes to actually
building things like this so I would
love to be able to try this out I could
even see myself I can I can even see us
here a pocket now and with XDA doing
something like who can build it the
fastest you know we could yeah for sure
all right awesome well I really want to
thank you for your time of to our
viewers and listeners make sure you
check out the Kickstarter campaign the
link is as always will be in the show
notes and we'll also share it on our
social media and everywhere so I want to
thank you again Albert thank you so much
for spending it before this I I wondered
I imagine it's pretty late over where
you are right now almost 9 p.m. yet
oh not too bad yeah I'm not too bad I'm
right to work now yeah definitely um
alright cool so we're going that will
connect again in the future I would say
good luck on the campaign but it's
already funded I hope it gets even
better for the next month thanks yeah
all right cool so back to the show for
