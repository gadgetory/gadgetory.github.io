an insane camera upgrade in the mix LG
wants to take a completely different
stab at its failed smartphone strategy
for 2018 and we get more details on what
to expect for the 1 plus 6 I'm Jaime
Rivera I am travelling but we've got
more content of CES 2018 coming soon
this is PocketNow daily believe it or
not there are pretty much no official
news today those are gonna continue
being covered by our CES coverage but
yes we have Evan blast talking about the
HTC u 11i and those of you that thought
that that would be the phone that will
launch in the United States instead of
the plus it turns out that it's not that
flagships and I'm tracking 652 specs are
not so bad and it's got ip67 water and
does resistance where the display is
just 1080p plus so yeah you learn more
in the description now let's talk about
the iPhone 10 2018 believe it or not if
you thought that the whole deal was just
Samsung and LG was going to be it
apparently Apple is planning to sell so
many iPhones this year that it's God
Japan display it's got sharp
it's got LG and it's got Samsung
obviously these are just reports from
supply chain though these are kind of
trusted so yeah a lot of iPhones now
let's talk about the one plus six for
those of you that have been following
just how much of a push oneplus is
making in the United States it's not
going to stop apparently we'll get the 1
plus 6 by q2 and we're not hearing much
information from carriers apparently the
company is not close to a good
negotiation but it would have to be just
that a good negotiation so stay tuned
and speaking of good negotiations we've
got LG CEO claiming that it's going to
change the way that it launches
smartphones apparently it does consider
its smartphone presence to be failed up
to the point where the company is no
longer going to play by what other
manufacturers do if Samsung launches a
phone LG's not going to follow up with
it we do hear some pet information and
some trademarks for the LG icon and LG
icons or ikonics whatever that case may
be hopefully we will see something at
MWC now we don't really know and finally
the very hot news today have to do with
the samsung galaxy as 9
for those of you that have been
following the rumors yes the Galaxy S 9
the small variant is not going to have
the specs of the Plus this time but
apparently there's this leaked box on
right on weibo that well it shows us
that we're gonna have an insane camera f
1.5 aperture and I'm the little confused
with the F 2.4 that's beside it because
this is going to be a single camera
that's the reason why we're taking this
box with a grain of salt but in addition
to that apparently we also will have a
super slow-mo feature and we're hoping
it's as good as what we saw with Sony
flagships recently at least so the
question today what do you think about
the specifications do you like what we
would probably get with the camera of
the galaxy s 9 in my case I do but we'll
see leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
