some very decent performance Apple watch
deals continue on some retailers as it
seems that it's not selling as expected
but it does seem that the tag heuer
SmartWatch might have surpassed the plan
success I'm hiya metal you betta and as
I saw Monday on the horizon yesterday I
started complaining this is sparking out
daily the official news today began with
Apple and Target or RJ as some people
call it as for those of you that weren't
able to get those deals for the Apple
watch on Black Friday it seems that the
company has decided to keep those deals
online for another couple of days until
December 12th actually you'd buy an
Apple watch and you'll be getting an
$100 gift certificate from Target for
you to buy anything else which could
pretty much be one of those very cheap
Smart Watch bands because the other ones
are just too expensive for that but
anyways there's the option and believe
it or not if you thought the Tag Heuer
was going to sync with that $1500
Android wear SmartWatch think again the
company's not providing any details but
according to them they found success and
they will be launching more devices from
this collection they're not specifying
when they're just saying that it could
happen sometime around next year but
yeah it seems that that actually worked
for them let's just see if they could
drop the price tag at some point and we
continue with more wearable news we
actually received the reason software
update for the Samsung gear s2 and look
for a couple of changes and we really
didn't see much up to the point where it
seems the company has decided to launch
another software update that brings even
more improvements and yes it even brings
more watch raises something that is
desperately needed by this particular
SmartWatch it also brings other
performance improvements in addition to
better integration from ESPN and other
third-party applications and the update
should be available to you soon we'll
definitely go give it a try in our
review unit and if you thought that
Apple's iPad pro would make a
significant dent in the market on launch
think again we've got some market
statistics over which tablets sold best
last month and you're gonna be shocked
for the first time ever it wasn't an
iPad it was actually the Microsoft
Surface pro they're not specifying if
it's the surface pro 3 or the surface
pro 4 and in the case of the surface pro
3 this is actually one of the best deals
out there for what you're getting
apparently it has 45% in sales from the
market compared to a 17% from the iPad
and then the Kindles are at 10% that is
a significant spike in sales let's just
hope that it continues finally the very
hot news today have to do with Samsung
and the galaxy s7 as we get some
preliminary benchmarks obviously nothing
to consider confirmed but we learned two
things about the galaxy s7 number one is
that well obviously the multi-core tests
show that this device is superior to the
iPhone 6s the a9 but obviously not the
single core ones and that is the typical
case all the time but then again when we
learn about the differences between the
snapdragon 820 and the Exynos variant we
get to see that both devices pretty much
perform the same with either processor
which is rather interesting it would be
the first time that we see that from
Samsung and we do notice now that
contribution between the Snapdragon 820
and Samsung
you know what Qualcomm and Samsung have
been doing but it does lead me to the
question of the day if you have to
choose if you had the option to choose
Snapdragon 820 or the Exynos variant of
the galaxy s7 which one would you pick
you know I would always go for the
Snapdragon processor but after testing
the new lexan O's on the galaxy note 5
and the galaxy s6 I'm rather satisfied
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think friends yes as
always you know the drill if you want to
