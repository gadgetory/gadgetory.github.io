siren will you quit the internet if net
neutrality dies how secure could your
SmartWatch really be why do you need a
separate facebook Messenger app on
Windows Phone lots of questions for
readers of pocket now's editorial pages
this week let's review them in five
minutes or less I'm Michael Fisher and
this is pocket now ground up the
internet is under fire from those who
would compromise your connection speed
in the name of big business and
compromise your privacy in the name of
security so goes the narrative of the
rightfully concerned with Taylor Martin
asking whether you'll still carry a
smartphone if your carrier breaks with
net neutrality principles I provided my
answer to our poll question go provide
yours and while you're over there check
out Joe Levi's companion article on how
carriers are already punishing content
providers based on the type of data they
provide then learn about the privacy
side of our brave new world find out if
the super secure black phone is really
the answer to evading government
surveillance and Joe Levi's in-depth
exploration of everything from custom
app permissions to file encryption
within the silent circle smartphone and
make sure also to catch Joe's editorial
on the relative security of our favorite
new gadget category smartwatches when
they work as designed all our
notifications passed through them so how
secure are they it's a question worth
asking and one Joe does his best to
answer all this talk of privacy puts me
in mind of an old smartphone maker that
built much of its reputation on secure
communications that's right blackberry
is still fighting the good fight and at
mwc it announced that in addition to
pursuing both high and low end new
hardware it would release a classic
device in the queue 20 including not
just a physical keyboard but also
bringing back the so-called tool belt of
a trackpad with function keys I wrote a
piece on just why I think this is a
waste of time and resources even if I
myself might be
to buy one while we're on the subject of
underdogs the world's third place mobile
platform might have been a no-show at
mwc but it's been big in our editorials
this week a bevy of dual boot rumors
have Taylor Martin wondering about the
possibilities for windows phone software
on Android hardware a concept he
explores with his usual thoroughness in
a nice piece called the beauty of choice
meanwhile our Microsoft expert Adam Lane
weighs in on why exactly Windows Phone
needs the facebook Messenger app it got
this week while I tell the story of my
time with Nokia's Lumia icon the
smartphone Taylor called the best
Windows Phone ever a contention I
address head-on in my review rebuttal
and spoiler alert Taylor and I don't
always disagree and speaking of spoilers
the king of smartphone news leaks Evan
blass of efflux sat down with us
yesterday on the pocket now weekly for
the most in-depth interview we've ever
given on the podcast what would you say
to the people who think that what you do
is illegal I would thought I wanted to
the question well that's that's valid
like that no it makes sense I I
understand what about well what about
immoral of course we also cover the news
of the week in that pod cast including
all new HTC One leaks rumors on LG's g3
and the Nexus 6 and hints of a google
glass competitor from Samsung but it's
friday and you want to cap off your week
with a comfy editorial not the news so
Adam doubt has just the thing for you a
nice almost sweet piece about the trials
and tribulations of adopting a
mobile-only lifestyle when you're a
family man from an HTC made Moto X to
the true definition of waterproof
there's a lot more in the editorial
pages of the site but we are out of time
down in the description below you will
find links to all the stories mentioned
on this show and there's also a like
button down there
please click it if you enjoyed this
roundup and stay tuned next week for
another throwback review I think you're
really going to like this one as well as
some conventional reviews both on
tablets plus all the usual news video
editorials and features you've come to
expect from pocket now until next time
this has been michael fisher with the
pocket now roundup wishing you an
excellent weekend no matter what mobile
device is filling your pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
