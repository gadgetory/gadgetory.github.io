all circulating around by now but a lot
of them still leave you wondering is
this worth the extra money coming from
last year's iPhone 6 I'm high on Houston
with pocket now and let's find out in
our head-to-head comparison starting
with the aesthetic design the iPhone 6
and iPhone 6s are almost completely
identical in fact there are really only
two ways to tell them apart from the
outside the iPhone 6s has an S icon on
the back taking the place of the typical
regulatory markings that you'll find on
the iPhone 6 and the new iPhone comes
with a new rose gold color option or you
know pink aside from that you really
can't tell one apart from the other
until you turn them on both phones are
capable of running iOS 9 Apple's latest
mobile operating system which comes with
a slew of new features like the
proactive panel to the left of the main
home screens spotlight search for
quickly looking up apps contacts or
webpages a new multitasking screen a
software back button and plenty more but
only the iPhone 6s has 3d touch if you
haven't heard about it this is the crazy
new pressure-sensitive display
technology that lets you add a bit of
force when you touch the screen to call
up additional menus on icons preview
emails and much much more it's still in
its infant stage and we're waiting on
more apps to add in 3d touch
functionality but it's already showing a
lot of potential and even if it isn't
worth the upgrade right away it will be
once it gains more traction be sure to
watch our reviews of the iPhone 6s and
6s plus for more details on 3d touch but
this is going to be a big deal
while the iPhone 6 and 6s have the same
display size and resolution and nearly
identical designs there's a big jump in
internal specifications between the two
phones the iPhone 6s has a much faster
processor with an updated GPU inside and
the doubled RAM from 1 to 2 gigabytes
makes a hugely noticeable difference in
jumping between the current app and when
you haven't opened in a few hours where
the iPhone 6 will have to reload that
app entirely the 6s jumps right back in
like you've been running it all along
the 6s also sports a new version of
touch ID that's twice as fast as last
year and it's so fast in fact that it
might even be too fast the fingerprint
scanner of the iPhone 6 never felt
sluggish anyway and you really can't
even check your notifications on the new
iPhone without it immediately unlocking
it's weird to complain about something
being too efficient but it actually is a
little frustrating sometimes the only
solution we have is to use a different
finger on the home button or just press
the power button instead the iPhone has
always been known to take some of the
best photos in mobile and that's done
nothing but improved with the 6s but you
know the jump from 8 to 12 megapixels
really doesn't make a huge difference in
photo quality both look very similar and
each takes nice photos with true-to-life
colors the bigger difference you'll
notice is in video recording where the
iPhone 6s takes the cake by being the
first ever iPhone to support 4k video
capture it's among the best-looking for
K video we've seen from a smartphone
though neither has OIS like your larger
plus-size siblings
circling back to the original question
is the iPhone 6s worth the upgrade if
you already have an iPhone 6 well
probably not at least not yet
3d touch is great but it's not
widespread enough just yet and most of
the other functions of the iPhone 6s are
already available in the iPhone 6 sure
you'll miss out on 4k video and live
photos but that's probably not worth
spending the money to upgrade unless you
absolutely have to have the newest phone
or the rose gold finish so just like we
say with every S model iPhone save your
money if you're coming from an iPhone 6
and just wait for the iPhone 7 to hit
next year if on the other hand you're
coming from an iPhone 5s or older maybe
now's the time to finally make that jump
or next or edge if you want to see more
iPhone 6s content well today's your
lucky day we've got plenty of it here on
