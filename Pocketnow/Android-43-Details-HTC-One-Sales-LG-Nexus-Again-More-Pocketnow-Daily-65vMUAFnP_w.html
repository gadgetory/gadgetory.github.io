than 5 point 0 for Google i/o HTC is
already seeing sales improvements with
their HTC One and LG seems to be in
charge of the future Nexus smartphone
this year I'm high Nevada and all of you
have my permission to take a nap after
watching this video this is pocket now
daily let's start today off talking
about Windows Phone those of you curious
for the next versions of gdr2 it's
already being rumoured in carriers to be
ready for testing in mid-may and
obviously it'll take carriers a little
time couple of weeks to get that pushed
out into and users but then those of you
curious about Hardware coming up well
we've got some leaked banners of the
Nokia Lumia 928 already and it's
boasting a great low-light performance
camera so really curious to see what
comes out of this phone eventually with
that xenon flash and everything but
again it could either be the event from
verizon and mayor also the London event
from Nokia in May so subscribe to our
YouTube channel and we will keep you
posted on what happens now let's move
over to HTC we initially discover that
there was a red HTC One being shown at
the website before it was pulled by you
know the company and apparently UK
listings already show that there is it
red HTC One coming soon we just don't
know when but on a sort of a positive
note HTC is up twenty-six percent in
sales in comparison to March thanks to
the HTC One this is pretty much the only
phone they've announced but the problem
is they're still thirty-seven percent
down compared to last year but remember
we had three phones last year and this
time we only have one so this is kind of
logical the m4 could not come soon
enough and now let's talk about
blackberry for all five of you that were
intrigued about that blackberry r10 and
yes that phone was that ugly we've got
some recent photos comparing it to the
blackberry q10 and judging by everything
we see here first of all we do get a
blackberry ins and second of all the
blackberry q10 is a much prettier phone
so don't even wait for this are 10 i
mean the q10 if you really need accurate
a keyboard that's the way to go the
other one is ugly and now let's talk
about LG we've got some leaked
photographs of a very beautiful looking
phone that's already being dubbed the lg
optimus g2 we've got some
suspects and just about everything
coming up and yeah I mean the phone
looks a lot like the optimus g pro and
mia even the galaxy note 2 but aside
from that we've also got some league
reports that well LG will be in charge
of the following Nexus program meaning
whether it be called the Nexus 5 or
nexus 4 regardless what's coming up in
the future most likely in the fall will
be coming from LG so I keep my eye on
this Optimus g2 as most probably the
next version of the nexus phone will
look a lot like this phone either
inspector InDesign and finally for the
oh no I don't know what to make of a
news of the day well we've got some more
rumors that we aren't getting android
5.0 key lime pie for google i/o in the
next coming days apparently we're just
getting another flavor of jelly bean
being dubbed 4.3 and some minor upgrades
that are not really groundbreaking
apparently we don't know what could
happen I mean I don't think they're
gonna be using google i/o for just a
minor update to android and still jelly
bean it's not even a year old still so I
want to cut some slack to Google but not
easy to the question of the day would
you be happier would you be disappointed
if you only got another version version
4.3 of jelly bean coming up instead of
key lime pie in our particular case
while with the fact that Windows Phone
hasn't really sold well and the fact
that iOS 6 was a complete disaster we do
understand that Google will probably
want to keep their new card under the
sleeve for the future and not
necessarily for this version of google
i/o but sadly I wouldn't want to wait
another year for Android 5.9 so leave us
a comment down below would you like to
wait or would you like to get android
5.0 of course as always for another
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet roll but she

to tell you can also follow me on
