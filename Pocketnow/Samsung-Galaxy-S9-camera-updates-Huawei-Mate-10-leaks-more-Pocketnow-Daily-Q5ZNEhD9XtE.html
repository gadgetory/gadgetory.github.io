already begin to point to insane camera
features leaked images as a huawei May
10 reveal less bezels but they're still
there and I will continues to make
services more expensive though silently
one more time I'm high memory data and
for those of you asking about the
awesome t-shirts it's ripped apparel in
the comments there will be a link in
addition to a 10% off coupon this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with inexpensive products Amazon
has just launched its new Fire HD 10
tablet this new upgrade doesn't really
bring many specification improvements
just a new design and the benefit that
now you get Amazon Alexa working on this
tablet so yeah it's pretty much clear
that the company is now expanding its
service to more than just speakers which
is great their official news have to do
with Apple the company has just launched
iOS 11 two iPads and iPhones those of
you with a compatible device and the
list is actually rather large you have
the advantage that there are a ton of
improvements not necessarily for iPhones
but definitely for iPads the only
interesting fact is that this is the
first time that I ever see any version
of iOS way to gigabytes that's a crazy
amount of storage space and for those of
you rocking 16 gigabyte devices that's
probably gonna be a problem
and speaking of Apple the company
continues to make changes that it didn't
make public starting with the cost of
screen replacements if you have an
iPhone
well now it's going to cost you $20 more
to get that screen replace then it's
just rather interesting the company has
made all these changes without making
them public yes it will cost you from
150 dollars to 170 now and we're talking
about accidental damage by the way if
you're covered by Apple Care Plus that
cost this pretty much still the same
unless you get one of the new iPhones
that's over the huawei mate n we are
very close to the companies event we
cannot wait to see what's new but
interesting we've got some leaked images
of the front of the phone we heard that
Huawei was teasing this display that was
going to mimic to a certain degree
having no bezels as what the trend is
going for you know flagships but as it
turns out this display does have less
bezels but they're still there
one interesting change is that the
fingerprint scanner now moves to the
front
it seems that Huawei is following its
p10 design rather interesting as every
other company is moving away from
fingerprint scanners at the front and
finally the very interesting rumors do
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 9
yes we're already talking about these
the most important ones are the fact
that apparently Samsung is going to
continue its plan on iterating design
and focusing on features and the most
important feature comes to the camera
apparently the company is going to mimic
what Sony is doing with its 1,000 frames
per second video slow motion which looks
gorgeous from Sony but the problem is
that Sony doesn't really sell as much to
Samsung so it's great to see this
feature come to the Galaxy S 9 that's
all fine and dandy but the question is
you know what the design of the iPhone 8
the iPhone 10 actually and in the case
of the essential phone today's question
is mainly focused on the Galaxy S 9 do
you think that it's smart for Samsung to
iterate its design not saying that it's
not futuristic but definitely there are
certain phones that look completely
different in my case I think that it
would be nice for Samsung to play a
little more with its design but leave us
a comment down below I'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
