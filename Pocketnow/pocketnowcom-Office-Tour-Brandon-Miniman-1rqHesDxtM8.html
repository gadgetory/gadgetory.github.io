pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to give you a tour of my office
where I write all of my posts to do all
of my videos for pocketnow.com
and soon a couple of other PocketNow
writers are gonna come on and show you
their workspace so you can get a
behind-the-scenes view of what goes on
when we make videos and write posts for
PocketNow so let's get to it
alright so let's take a look so
basically this is the second bedroom in
my apartment which I've converted to an
office pretty simple so over here on the
left and on the right I've got a
whiteboard and if I could I would tile
my walls with whiteboards because
there's something just so satisfying
writing something on the wall and ink
seems very official I don't know huge
fan of whiteboards anyway let's continue
I'll talk about my monitor
configurations in a second behind these
monitors I've got over here a Vonage
voice over IP router I was one of the
early adopters of voice over IP I think
just because the economics are really
good we people pay twenty five bucks a
month you get unlimited calls to
anywhere in the US and I just find
something really satisfying about using
a landline so I connect to my landline
to this phone which has a really loud
speakerphone I find it to be a lot more
comfortable than holding a cell phone in
my hand which I think all of us do for
many hours a week anyway so it's nice to
have that and of course Verizon and
Comcast pretty much everyone has their
own voice over IP service these days for
the same price but I keep vonage because
it works over here I've got a d-link
router which I had to get so that I
could get some very key wires out in the
open so over here I have micro USB which
is standard pretty much for all
smartphones now thank goodness over here
is mini USB for some of the older
devices and for my camcorder and I've
got the iPhone connector down here
because I've been using that recently
and there's somewhere else I've got a
charger for my camera down there you get
the point so let's talk about my
computer
I've got two 24 inch monitors on the
left I chose 24 because 30 is too big
and I think 22 is too small also with
these monitors they are Dell I think
24:08 f2 WPS you get 19
20 by 1280 resolution which is extremely
high and the only way to get higher than
that is to go to a 30-inch monitor and
I've really enjoyed having the
resolution because I can fit a lot on
the screen at one time I could fit four
browser windows from here here here and
here it's just it's very convenient to
have over here on the right is a
portrait monitor which serves just as a
Twitter client i watch twitter for my
personal account plus a couple of
websites so i need to have twitter open
at all times to see what is going on in
front of my monitors I usually have a
couple of smartphones that I'm reviewing
or I'm playing with or comparing doing
some doing some research on so over here
we've the iPhone 3GS
the Google Nexus One and the iPhone 4 it
just so happens I've been comparing
these three devices for an upcoming
video where we're gonna talk about the
Retina display and how it compares
pulling out the keyboard I've got one of
these Microsoft Wave keyboards but not
the hard poor way where it's split off
to the left and the right as a gentle
curve I really like the ergonomics of
having the curved and then I've got a
logitech hmm I don't know what this
about it's the VX revolution notebook
Mouse and I like the notebook mouse it's
smaller in size it's not huge and it
also has this free scrolling wheel which
I think is really really handy when
you're trying to get through a huge
webpage or large PDF or something like
that
coffee speakers much tick I don't know
the model of them tend to forget these
things and there's the base station for
the phone connected to Vantage and
here's what it looks like outside of my
window it looks onto the balcony and
they're doing some construction out
there so I pretty much get a view of
some trees and the parking lot alright
let's back out a little bit and talk
about this computer an old computer not
the prettiest thing ever I go that I
think in February of 2007 so it's
starting to show its age but it's still
kicking quite nice it is a Core 2 Duo
processor it came stock at 2.6 gigahertz
overclock 2 3 4 gigabytes of RAM I have
a solid-state drive running Windows 7 64
bit edition and beyond that what else is
there is - no - graphics cards so that
it can handle the three monitors they're
just I think Nvidia
9600 GT s so nothing terribly fancy but
it definitely works for what I need it
for although when rendering HD video
like this one it slows down my computer
big-time so I'm trying to figure out
something to get some speed back didn't
show you here this webcam nothing
nothing crazy still Microsoft webcam a
little bit of artwork I'm not an art
kind of sword but my mother said I
needed more color in the office okay
there you go MA
down here I've got a broken foot stool
here trying to have a good posture
whenever possible since I'm in front of
the computer for like a million hours a
day I'm an old Dell laser printer here
this was one of the first Dell laser
printers that came in under $100 now
most most of them are the consumer range
anyway previous to that in the early
2000s they were like 500 600 bucks so
Weiser printing technology for everyone
yay
here is the subwoofer for the speakers
it's in the corner of the room so it
works particularly well to produce some
really good bass and then here's my
wireless router it's just a standard
verizon fios router I'm hooked up to
their fiber optics it was really happy
to go away from Comcast
I don't like Comcast at all and I hope
they're watching this video so they can
hear that they really bad customer
service they raise their prices and I'm
really happy to go with Verizon FiOS to
be honest a lot of wires back here what
are you gonna do no one looks down here
except for you right now okay all right
so let's zoom out a little bit here this
is my chair this is where I film all my
videos this is the tripod but my camera
up here put the phone here and film away
this is a nice void looking material but
it picks up fingerprints a lot so I'm
constantly having to clean it kind of
annoying in the corner of the room here
is the fan it's just a rotating fan gets
really hot in here with the computer
producing a lot of heat and I'm gonna
show you my bookshelf here I've got some
phones up here that I'd like to keep on
hand for reviewing so I can take them
out do size comparisons for YouTube or
or if I'm doing a written review over
here I've got the Kin been messing
around with that not big fan of the Kin
I don't know if it's on let's see if
it's on it's not the interface is slow
and well this is not a video about the
skin
got a one terabyte external hard drive
for backing up old CD RS which I don't
use anymore you know you buy stacks of
like 200 and you don't use them unless
it's 1999 when you're burning mixed CDs
for your friends so have got some books
here mostly business books a couple of
fiction books I was a business student
so I like to read business books down
here these phones aren't real they are
dummy units so don't think that I have
all of these phones just sitting here
kind of thrown about they are dummy
units that don't work and they're handy
for use when I do some reviews and
compare these devices to others this is
a really cool device by the way
something I never actually played with
in real life it's the East 72 Nokia nice
keyboard very very thin probably one of
the best messaging devices ever see what
else is in here this is the Yoda so the
own Acer neo touch this is one of the
first Windows mobile phones I think it
was the first that had Snapdragon CPU
have some compressed air back there to
keep phones clean before I put them on
video spray the dust away from them so
see what else we have here this is the
camera that I use for all of my reviews
it's really old but it does an awesome
job taking close-ups so that's why I use
it I also like the swivel lens which
helps a lot to get really good camera
angles I probably should hold it by the
swivel lens and because this is huge and
unsightly I can't carry this around on a
trip so I have this little Sony that is
nice and compact and slightly better
looking than the other packaging tape
you get the point down here this is a
t-shirt that I use to clean off devices
before I put them on camera just a soft
cotton shirt this is the best name on
the planet that everyone in the world
should own it's called a catchphrase it
is well look it up online and you'll see
why it's it's fun great for when you
have people over not an advertisement
for catchphrase and then down here some
accounting stuff charger for the Kindle
and here is just a cause it with a mess
of different things lots of wires and
things that I really don't have a place
for I'm glad that there are doors on
this closet so people don't get to see
this mess but you're looking at it right
now it's old speaker system I think this
is camera
sound works down here pretty pretty good
for entertaining
I don't think Cambridge sound works as
around anymore and laptop bag or to one
of them started to rip so I got a new
one I guess I should throw away the one
that's ripped shouldn't I
but anyway so that is a look and what's
inside my closet that's a look at what
I've got going on here in my office and
I hope you enjoyed the video and stay
tuned for more of these videos from
other PocketNow writers that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
