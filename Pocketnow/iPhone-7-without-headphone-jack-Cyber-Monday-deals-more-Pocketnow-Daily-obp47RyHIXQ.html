dramatically change the iPhone 7s design
marshmallow updates start landing on
android flagships from LG and if you're
still out for cyber monday deals yes we
do have your back I'm Jaime that and I
would call this cyborg Monday because I
had to wake up like machines do this is
parking out daily
yes hello cyber monday the official news
today start with that just like we
covered with Black Friday we also have a
separate article with cyber monday deals
our ton of deals out there that are
actually worth it and considering the
fact that Black Friday is mostly for
everything in Cyber Monday is just cyber
yeah some of the best deals were left
for today for those of you that are out
for technology and speaking of Black
Friday for those of you who are
wondering exactly how much was sold
during the period well believe it or not
Alice are already predicting 2.7 billion
dollars in sales and for those of you
wondering which is the most popular
platform whenever you want to buy
something not necessarily for that
particular product but something well it
seems that iOS it is as well mobile
payments were 900 million and out of
that 74 percent meaning six hundred and
something million dollars were acquired
using iOS devices iPads iPhones it's
just to wonder exactly why is it that
even though there are more Android
devices out there people buy more from
their iOS ones and if we had to narrow
it down to the hottest deal of cyber
monday it definitely has to be amazon's
offer of the galaxy s6 believe it or not
it's being offered for just $400 that's
a crazy price tag there's probably one
of the best phones of the year it
definitely has one of the best cameras
of the year and yeah it's probably a
year old almost the next few months but
it still is a very hot product to buy
definitely have to put up with a skimpy
battery life but anyways that's probably
the best deal but fine let's move away
from deals start handling the news
starting with the LG g4 we covered the
marshmallow update in Poland then that
got pulled and then it got launched in
Korea and we've been waiting ever since
but for those of you interested in
marshmallow if you're in Europe you are
and luck is people in Germany and other
countries already claiming that Marshman
started landing on their devices today
so make sure you hit a software up that
if he got the unlocked variant and for
us that habit from us carriers will have
to wait and finally the very hot
rumors today have to do with the iPhone
7 we've got trusted sources claiming
that Apple plans to bring some major
design changes but the biggest hurdle
the company has is the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but company wants to
shave off as much as one millimeter in
thickness from the iPhone success bring
that to the iPhone 7 but then again they
have to get rid of the port and the
solution is the lightning cable and the
company already published ways to bring
high quality audio through the lightning
cable and hey this is not new Windows
Mobile OEMs that that years ago through
mini USB so even though Apple changed
that with the Eifel and brought back the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack it seems
that times are changing again and yeah
this jack is kind of dated but it
doesn't lead me to the question of the
day would it affect you would this be a
deal-breaker if your next phone would
not bring the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack in my case it wouldn't because I
use Bluetooth audio yeah I know I'm not
an audiophile but leave us a comment

would think friends as always you know
