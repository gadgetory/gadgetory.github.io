pocketnow.com
there's a lot of rumors about what
Microsoft is going to announce at Mobile
World Congress 2010 but one thing's for
sure they're likely to talk about an
involved version of windows mobile 6.5
really what 6.5 was supposed to be
people are calling it Windows Mobile 6
point 6 or at least that's the rumor and
Microsoft will sort of branded as the
capacitive this capacitive supporting
version of Windows Mobile 4 sort of
lower end devices and then it remains to
be seen whether they're going to talk
about Windows Mobile 7 our guess is that
they will there's rumors that there will
be two versions of Windows Mobile 7 so a
lot of different versions of Windows
Mobile in the past we've shown you sort
of this evolved version of windows
mobile 6.5 which a lot of people have
called six point five point three so
what we wanted to do is take you through
the latest which is build twenty three
five one eight from xda-developers
and show you sort of all of the things
that have come together to really make
this different than Windows Mobile 6
point 5 that you would get on a Windows
Phone that you could buy in a store
right now so let's go through a few
things ok let's take a look at the Start
menu so we're gonna go to the button on
the bottom here and that's really the
most noticeable difference about six
point five point three or six point six
whatever you want to call it compared to
six point five all of the buttons reside
on the bottom of the screen making them
more finger friendly so you don't
necessarily have to use a stylus and
they're very graphical too they're not
necessarily text-based for example for
lock there's a lock icon
whereas in windows mobile 6.5 that same
area has text that says lock so here's a
HTC hd2 and down there it says lock six
point five point three actually has a
little icon another thing you can do in
Windows Mobile 6 point 5 point 3 that
you can't do in 6 point 5 is move around
icons to anywhere on the screen whereas
in six point five you could move them
around but you would have to tap and
hold and do move to top or move down
there wasn't really anything else you
could do so this should have been the
way six point five was off the bat right
and this works in the settings screen or
really any other place something else
that
different in six point five point three
is the notification area at the top of
the screen so if we tap up there we get
serve this magnified view of icons that
we can action on and let's say we want
to tap on the battery and we're taken to
the battery application and you get the
point and if there are too many
notifications up there you can actually
scroll to the right and scroll to the
left if it's five on the screen at one
time let's go into email because there
are some changes in the email
application or outlook mobile as we know
it very well by now something that's new
is now we get a preview of the email
which is nice
underneath the sender we also get
threaded messaging so here I've got an
email with Malatesta if I tap on his
email I get all of the different emails
that I've had with him sort of putting
them all into one screen and at the top
it says Mouse email very convenient and
as you can see of all these graphical
buttons are down here and they all
represent something different they're a
little bit cryptic and they'll take some
getting used to if this isn't indeed the
final the final look of Windows Mobile
6.6 but they do pretty much the same
thing that you've come to expect you
just have to sort of memorize what they
mean and you can filter by different
criteria up here right now it's filtered
by conversation view but of course you
can go back to message type or from
received subject and so on and so forth
something that's also new is that the
scroll bars on the right side of the
screen are different they're a little
bit thicker and we saw this a long time
ago in six point five point three but
they're much more easy to grab than you
would find in windows mobile 6.5 let's
get out of here and go into another
application let's just go into the
alarms application to show something
else a lot of the user interface
elements have been made bigger such as
the check boxes and also the drop-down
list much much larger much better suited
for a capacitive touchscreen display
where you can't use the precision of a
stylus okay let's go out of this and go
into another application this time let's
go into context okay here in context
they're an entirely new way to add
context so again we get these icons down
here instead of text and by the way if
you slide up in the keyboard and look at
this same screen in landscape it looks
really bad because these buttons get
very spaced out and very ugly take a
look yeah so here they are and there's
just a
bunch of random buttons scattered about
anyhow let's go into the create a new
contact screen it will flip it back to
portrait and we'll go to outlook contact
and this screen has been made much more
finger friendly compared to the other
sort of database looking contact entry
form so we can add a telephone number by
tapping here we get a nice large pop-up
and by the way all of the buttons have
been changed to this larger style
rounded windows esque style of buttons
we can add an email address and so on
and so forth and it's much easier to add
a new add a picture for the person we
could swipe to the right to go to the
next tab and that's bringing up notes so
the keyboard just popped up then we can
go to set ringtone and you're back to
where you started so a nicer interface
for adding contacts and there's one more
thing we want to show you in this
version of windows mobile 6.5 point
three pocket Internet Explorer actually
looks a little bit different although
strangely different so if we go into
Internet Explorer mobile the buttons on
the bottom have been sort of
reconfigured and right now there's a
little error message I'm gonna click
cancel and if you take a look down here
on the bottom we have a start menu
button Y in the browser I don't know and
we also have an X button so let's take a
look at how that looked in windows
mobile 6.5 just as a comparison okay so
here are the buttons in 6.5 here there
are in 6.5 point 3 there now there's an
extra X button which does make sense but
there's also a Start menu button which
is really strange and it literally opens
the Start menu for some reason so a lot
of mysterious changes in windows mobile
6.5 we're really at the end of the day
unsure what Microsoft is going to do at
Mobile World Congress but it's a good
bet that they're gonna release some
evolution of windows mobile 6.5 possibly
called six point six that will bring
support for capacitive touchscreen
displays and sort of buy them a little
bit more time before shipping you know
the amazing Windows Mobile 7 will keep
an eye on it be sure to follow us on
Twitter for the latest on Windows Mobile
7 and Windows Mobile 6.6 or whatever
they're calling it at twitter.com slash
