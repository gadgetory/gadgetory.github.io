the company claimed that the main
inspiration for the g5 was quote-unquote
to wake up our play instinct and end the
boredom surrounding smartphones lately
the era of experimentation had ended in
2007 and the market is currently in
desperate need for a shake-up whether LG
has achieved that goal has been a major
topic of both debate and controversy
over the last few weeks and it's now
time to reach our final thoughts and
conclusions
I'm hi never leave a tie with pocket now
when this is our review of the LG g5
innovation is kind of hard to come by
these days ever since the first iPhone
launch competitors have stopped
experimenting and focusing more on
simplicity the newer surge of technology
has served more to make smartphones
prettier and not really to make them
more useful from a design standpoint the
LG g5 could easily pass as any other
pretty phone the micronized aluminum is
kerf ergonomics and meets a curved sheet
of Gorilla Glass 4 that LG dubs 3d art
glass this micronized treatment is a
clear form of experimentation and has
led to a lot of controversy with a lot
of channels even calling it plastic in
reality this is a premier coat of paint
over the aluminum like the average paint
job protecting any vehicle it serves as
a shield for the metal which in turn
covers the horrible antenna lines that
most of us hate the result is a very
solid finish in the Titan color of our
LG g fiber view unit even if warmer to
the touch compared to standard aluminum
the experimentation continues in the
bottom separation LG has ingeniously
designed this to be a modular smartphone
and the bottom slot is actually
replaceable the company has designed the
set of accessories at stubbing as
friends to serve to extend what the
phone can do if you want a camera grip
that also extends your battery there's
LG Chem plus if you want a high quality
audio deck there's a friend built in
conjunction with bhagava Lipson even
better if you want to replace your
battery the slot can also help you out
with that the process of replacing parts
just feels like taking a
weapon apart and LG hints the durability
by recommending that you do so that way
the whole idea is genius
elevating the potential of the g5 to
additional usage scenarios sure we've
seen some of this in other devices
through cases or sleeves but none of
these solutions are as elegant as on the
g5
sadly the experimentation comes at a
price and the g5 is not exempted paying
it the bottom slot doesn't sit flush
with the chassis and the Shatford bottom
can really feel rough on the palm the
separation also picks up lint rather
easily and we wonder how long the
plastic battery holder will last and
then there's the problem that paint
isn't really designed to take a beating
as a minor fall from a height of a chair
will attest the whole idea is great but
it clearly needed more polish under the
hood the g5 brings the standard combo of
specs we have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
match with four gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of expandable storage via microSD
day-to-day operation is a breeze and the
phone handles graphics intensive games
like a champ with little to no evident
heating showing the specifications is a
5.3 inch quad HD IPS display which LG
claims to be the evolution of the
quantum dot we saw last year blacks are
in deep much deeper on this display and
the color accuracy is still top-notch
it's also capable of an always-on mode
that provides notifications for
third-party applications through icons
LG also claims that there is no risk of
screen burn so it remains static and
sucks on less than 1% of battery every
hour
sadly the display isn't perfect and
brightness is my biggest complaint LG
claims that it's capable of going up to
850 myths but I actually find it to be
dimmer than competitors I always see
myself setting it up to 70% of
brightness just to be comfortable and in
direct sunlight it continues to be a
challenge even if the use of polarized
lenses has improved significantly when
compared to the G for experimentation
also extends to the software LG's new UX
5.0 running on top of Android 6.1 has
become another clear form of contour
see the app tray is now gone and US
carrier models don't really have an easy
way to bring it back I personally don't
mind not having it but the UX really
needs better options to organize
applications a quick shortcut within
folders to add more apps would be lovely
or at least some way to select a few
apps at a time in order to move them
around in stacks you also can't switch
your default home screen and multi
window also set it by with this change
pretty much the only thing that's left
this qslide applications which allows
you to hover a few apps on the screen
but it's limited to LG services and
Android and could not come soon enough
and everything else the software
approach is actually not that bad the UX
is more cohesive and some of the
flexibility from last year remains
untouched I love being able to reorder
navigation keys and add some more you
can still switch animations in the
homescreen and if you don't like the tab
view on settings there's also the option
to go back to ListView if you're after a
flexible UI out-of-the-box this
continues to be a good alternative even
though theming would really help it out
we've tested the LG g5 for eight days
around New York City phone calls have
been solid through the earpiece and it's
also one of the loudest speakers in the
business so long as you don't block it
with your finger essentials like the
fingerprint scanner mounted at the
backer quit to the touch even if I do
miss the volume buttons being back here
it's also great to see the IR blaster
make the cut at times when OEMs just
continue to remove it data speeds on
AT&amp;amp;T are great in the suburbs but it's
really unreliable in Manhattan even for
streaming music the fumbling goes as far
as to affect your battery life with
mixed results depending on where you
spent your day whenever I spent the day
in the suburbs the battery life lasted a
full day with up to four hours of screen
on time take the phone to the city and
slice that number by a third thankfully
the g5 supports fast charging through
USB type-c if that's not enough just
swap the battery and charge the spare
using the cradle that was bundled in the
box when it comes to the camera the d5
is simply the g5 the optically
stabilized combo includes
scene megapixel camera with F 1.8
aperture and a wide-angle 8 megapixel
camera with F 2.4 this wide angle camera
can be used to complement the primary
but it's actually designed to be
independent do not confuse this as a
fisheye lens as that one do it justice
the camera is capable of providing 135
degrees of field of view even dwarfing
what the human eye can do it 120 degrees
what this means is that if you're in
Manhattan the only way you can really
capture what your eye can see is using
this wide-angle camera that being said
the resulting photos of both cameras are
just gorgeous
LG continues its trend of providing one
of the best cameras in the industry
challenging point-and-shoot sand color
saturation contrast depth the field and
low-light performance the 8 megapixel
selfie camera also brings some decent
photos and you can actually use all
three cameras at once for convenience
manual controls are also available even
though we don't understand why manual
video controls didn't make the cut and
speaking of video the primary cameras
have a neat little trick where you can
begin recording with one camera and
finish the shot with another 4k video
recording is great even if stabilization
seems more effective on the wide-angle
sensor experimentation has really paid
off as a common problem for standard
cameras is the loss of field of view
when recording video or in wanting to
take a photo in the city and the word
experimentation is the best segue to end
our review the LG g5 may bring a lot of
controversy to the table but so does
every single product that tries to be
disruptive the phone is probably a
little too early for its time and that's
clear and how much LG needs to polish
the fit and finish and also tune the
display and everything else it's really
hard to just bash LG for trying new
things
the g5 tries to solve some real-world
problems and figures out a way to do so
with both creativity and elegance even
comparing the g5 to other smartphones
would be unfair given the phone's
potential it's a bold move into a new
concept of what smartphones should do
even if the first attempt needs a little
more work
if you're okay with the typical trend of
slabs then maybe the g5 is not the phone
for you now if you're a geek like most
of us and you're looking for a phone
that's capable of doing more than the LG
g5 is the first step in that right
direction even if the next step will
probably be a lot better
