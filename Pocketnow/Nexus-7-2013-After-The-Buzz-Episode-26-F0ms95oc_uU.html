our new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's have a look at a device several
months after its release when it's not
shiny and new anymore I'm Taylor Martin
with Pocket now these are Nexus 7 2013
and this is episode 26 of after the buzz
the hardware of the current Nexus 7 like
many Nexus devices to date is
understated Google and its elected
partner manufacturer in this case a soos
creates extremely affordable hardware to
promote and perfectly complement the
software the purest Google experience
possible understated hardware however
doesn't have to be poor hardware or even
ugly the Nexus 7 is neither of those
things it's a quaint yet beautiful
device and after five months of using it
our opinion of its hardware hasn't
changed a bit
the front is a stark black slab of glass
no buttons only a front camera and a
gorgeous 7 inch 1080p display the edges
are chamfered leading to a slight bevel
around the backside which is made of a
matte finished plastic originally it
came only in black but a white variant
was released in time for the holidays so
we picked one up we were surprised to
find it's not exactly white but more of
a very light shade of gray or an
off-white the black model has stood up
to the test of time quite well suffering
only a few faint scratches on the rear
and some hairline scratches on the
display the white model which we've only
had since December 13th shows some signs
of wear on the backside I'll be it very
very faint it now resembles an eggshell
around back another interesting tidbit
the black Nexus 7 models Hardware is
extremely solid and makes no squeaking
noises when gripping the device
the white model which utilizes a harder
plastic composition tends to squeak a
lot the specifications were
understandably mediocre at the time of
launch thanks to the need to keep costs
down
still the tablet is aging exceptionally
well at 2 gigabytes the RAM is fine 16
or 32 gigabytes of fixed Gorge is
acceptable and the display is gorgeous
and raised the bar for smaller tablet
display quality we still love having
wireless charging as an option and we
love NFC but the chipset is from last
year not the Snapdragon 600 or 800 we
were expecting it ships with the
Snapdragon s4 pro with a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Krait CPU and Adreno 320 GPU
we're not complaining but a seuss in
google left plenty of room to improve
next year the display is arguably the
most important feature of the Nexus 7 it
was among the first 7-inch tablets to
feature a 1080p pixel resolution at 323
pixels per inch the display is
incredibly crisp and the color
reproduction is fairly accurate frankly
it's one of the best displays on a small
tablet to date though there have been
some issues with dead pixels
unfortunately we found one dead pixel on
our white Nexus 7's display despite the
age specs and the nondescript design
this year's Nexus 7 is still one of the
best Android tablets money can buy
software is this tablet's main
differentiator carrying the Nexus brand
name comes with a unique perk this
tablet until it reaches end-of-life
status will always be among the first to
receive Android updates big or small
it's currently running the very latest
version of KitKat Android version 4.4.2
unlike the Nexus 5 the Nexus 7 on
Android 4.4.2 does not default to the
Google Experience launcher in fact it's
not a standard option at all and since
this is a tablet without an earpiece
speaker the new dialer with business
search and caller ID is missing but
other pieces of the KitKat puzzle are
present such as immersive mode faster
multitasking and wireless printing built
in and for that we're thankful it didn't
take long for the stock Android launcher
to lose its luster it offers a no frills
experience with a UI which is better
suited on a smartphone than a tablet so
we've supplemented with an aftermarket
option action
launcher since the launch of the new
Nexus 7 Google has given a ton of
attention to tablets specifically tablet
optimized application now have their
very own niche in Google Play under
tablet 101 and the tablet spotlight
Google Play also filters apps by those
designed for tablets by default and if
you want or need access to non tablet
apps simply change the filter the
software and apps situation on Android
is rapidly improving for tablets
becoming home to more and more beautiful
applications and games which are
optimized for larger displays we can't
say for certain if this is a direct
result of Google's efforts and please or
if it was inadvertently caused by
smartphones constantly approaching
tablet sizes either way we aren't
complaining despite using last year's
SOC performance on the Nexus 7 has not
been a problem throughout many months of
usage there are some intermittent
stutters but it's a far cry from the
first generation Nexus 7 and it can hang
with some of the best tablets out there
especially in gaming whether you favor
graphic intensive adrenaline-fueled
games like asphalt 8 or more casual
beautiful scenery type games the Nexus 7
is great inside the 15 watt hour battery
rated at 39 50 milliamp hours has always
managed to powers through a full day
plus on the heaviest of days we blessed
well into the night before needing to
plug in the speakers admittedly could be
a tad louder the sound is passable and
we're happy they provide great stereo
separation but the rear facing and
easily muffled by the palms of your
hands
finally the camera it serves well for
the few purposes any tablet has a camera
taking photos in a pinch and video
calling camera isn't terrible but it's
not noteworthy either a soos is building
a strong name for itself under the Nexus
brand the new Nexus 7 even at five
months old is an outstanding tablet and
a killer deal the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi
model starts at just two hundred and
twenty nine dollars double the storage
for only $40 more and add LTE
connectivity for another 80 for
everything from casual multimedia
playback and reading to browsing the web
and even intense gaming the 2013 Nexus 7
is the best small tablet for the job we
still recommend it to anyone looking for
a great tablet on the cheap or just a
great small tablet in general 2014 will
certainly bring stiff competition in the
small tablet space
but we're confident the 2013 Nexus 7
will hold its own with no problem well
into 2014 that's going to do it for
