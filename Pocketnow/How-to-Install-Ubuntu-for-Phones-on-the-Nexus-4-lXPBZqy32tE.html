Ubuntu touch Developer Preview to the
public and you might be asking yourself
how you can get it on your own devices
it's pretty simple I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is how you
install the Ubuntu touch Developer
Preview on your Nexus 4 it should go
without saying that there are some
preliminary steps to get Ubuntu for
phones up and running on your Nexus 4
first you should have a TB set up on
your computer and your devices
bootloader should be unlocked that's as
simple as rebooting the device to the
bootloader using the ADB reboot
bootloader command and typing and
fastboot OEM unlock this will take just
a few moments and your bootloader will
soon be unlocked and it will wipe
anything and everything that is on the
device off so it's a smart move to pack
up everything you need before hand next
you will need to install twrp which is a
custom recovery called the team wind
recovery project it's a free download
and all you need to do is download the
file and from within the terminal type
in fastboot flash recovery and the name
of the recovery image after you do this
it will take a second to flash and you
will need to reboot the device once you
do you will no longer see the stock
recovery option but you'll see TWRP from
here you need to perform a backup this
will save all of your information but in
the process this will be lost so if you
can move this backup off to an external
drive next you need to wipe the device
select the wipe option from the home of
TWRP and then select factory reset slide
to begin the wipe and this should take
just a few seconds once it finishes were
on to the meat of the process you will
need to download two images from
canonical site one specifically for the
Mako and one is the actual image for
Ubuntu the files are pretty large so it
could take some time once they download
move them to your desktop your phone
should still be in recovery mode so from
the home page of TWRP select advanced
and then tap adb sideload from there you
need to slide to begin and from terminal
on your computer type adb sideload and
the name of the file that you need to
flash the first one you should flash is
for the Mako this should only take a few
seconds and when it completes it will
prompt you to reboot however you do not
need to reboot hit the back button and
follow the same process again for the
second file type adb sideload into the
terminal on your computer and the name
of the file and press Enter this process
will take much longer as this is a large
the two files and once it finishes hit
reboot give it just a few moments and
your Nexus 4 will reboot to the welcome
screen for Ubuntu touch after a few more
minutes the device will finally get
started up and you can play around with
the whole new operating system the best
part of this entire process is that it's
just as easy to go back to Android as it
is to flash Ubuntu to begin with all you
have to do is download your factory
image directly from google reboot back
into your bootloader and flash the image
through fastboot takes just a few
minutes and you're back to how
everything started if you found this
