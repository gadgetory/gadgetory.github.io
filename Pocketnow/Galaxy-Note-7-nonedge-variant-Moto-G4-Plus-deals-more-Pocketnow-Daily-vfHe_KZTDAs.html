details of a possible second variant in
the works blackberry stresses how
important it will be for keyboards to
retain a future an encryption has just
landed on certain Facebook services at
least partially I'm high in metairie
meta and when recently asked what I like
to do on fridays i thought the response
was kind of obvious this is pocket out
daily official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for any of
the new moto g's the Moto G 4 plus is
currently fifty dollars off on Amazon if
you pretty much pre-ordered because the
phone is actually not even available to
anybody yet our view units pretty much
arrived today but that is really good
news given the fact that you're getting
all the full-blown extras that you're
now getting with the regular moto g 4
and at that budget price of two hundred
dollars it makes a lot of sense and even
though encryption is not really
something that a lot of people care
about not one of the cases that's rather
interesting is Facebook which has just
started rolling encryption to
peer-to-peer facebook Messenger
conversations and most interesting part
is the fact that they're actually doing
it in a very odd way mainly because
number one it's limited to only a
certain amount of users right now to
obviously because of encryption you will
only be able to have encrypted
conversations between one device and
another meaning if you have that same
facebook messenger account on your
computer on your tablet and your phone
it'll only work encrypted from one
specific device which is really the way
to go I just wonder exactly how the
implementation will be we will be
reporting as soon as we learn more and
for those of you that have been
wondering exactly how the blackberry
future will be yeah we do too actually
we've heard that there are two devices
in the works we're wondering if these
are going to be more like the Privy not
because the probe was cool but kind of
underwhelming at the same time because
of the price tag apparently these budget
devices are actually bringing a keyboard
mainly because well the company's a
senior vice president of the vice sales
just confirmed that the keyboards aren't
going anywhere now we're not exactly
sure if that means that both devices
will get it but stay tuned we should
learn more very soon I was just rather
odd Consumer Reports just the nail their
verdict for the galaxy s7 active not
rekt
mending the phone for water submersion
and the reason why it's hot is because
they applied that same test they
simulated the five liters of water 30
minutes on the Galaxy s7 and galaxy s of
an edge and then on the active and the
only devices didn't pass it was the
active up to the point where they got
another active and they tested that
other active it it also did not pass
that same water submersion tests could
it be that there is some problem with
the galaxy s of an active that is not
existent on the regular Galaxy s7 that
is something that is again extremely odd
just buyers me where and finally the
very interesting rumors today I have to
do with the galaxy note 7 we are just a
few weeks away from when we expect this
phone to be announced Argost second
probably and this is interesting we've
been covering that there is rumored
benchmarks of a regular less respect
note 7 for verizon now we find more
specific ations hear that tell us that
this device will probably be even less
powerful than we thought at first we
thought that it would be as powerful as
the current Galaxy s7 and no it seems
that it'll bring the same exynos 7420
processor that we currently see on the
galaxy note 5 and differences here are
mainly that you're not getting an edge
variant apparently if you want the full
blown power you have to go edge and if
you want lesser specifications on a flat
display then there is apparently a light
variant out there which just makes
things a little more confusing but then
again that's kind of like the way
Samsung performs which leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about these rumors do you think that it
makes sense for samsung to launch a less
powerful galaxy note 7 and just give you
the option to not get the edge on this
particular device because in my case I
think it doesn't make any sense why not
just launched two notes Evans one
without the edge one with the edge and
simply price them accordingly leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
