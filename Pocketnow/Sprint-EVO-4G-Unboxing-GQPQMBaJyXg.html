pocketnow.com back when the HD 2 was
released we were left wondering when is
the Android version of this amazing
phone going to be released this device
has a beautiful huge screen it's super
thin and it grabs attention wherever you
go we finally have the answer it's the
sprint Evo 4G it's the first 4G
smartphone in the United States being
able to take advantage of the WiMAX
network that Sprint has built up in
collaboration with Clearwire this means
that you can get maximum download speeds
of about 10 megabits per second
whether that matters we're going to talk
about that in a future video because a
lot of people are wondering does 4G even
matter right now is there anything that
can really take advantage of it and
we're going to talk about that soon I've
actually got 4G in my area so I'm going
to be able to test the smart phone as it
was intended I can't wait to get to the
unboxing let's take a look at the Evo 4G
on Sprint let's do it now
all right so let's get to the unboxing
okay let's get past everything and go
right to the device and I'm gonna peel
off the protective code coating here
beautiful gorgeous screen on this 4.3
inches we have these flat capacitive
buttons versus the HTC hd2 which has the
hardware buttons we're gonna do a
comparison of that in a second let's
look around the device got this 8
megapixel camera with a dual LED flash
this really cool kickstand which I think
actually makes the device bigger because
of it and what's cool is that the red
area behind these this back battery
cover shows through here and up here so
if we take off the back battery cover
you'll see that it's actually red so a
nice little touch there snap this back
on sometimes it's difficult to get it on
evenly I'll just pop it on there like so
we've got the front-facing video camera
for video chat and beyond that it looks
like an HD - it doesn't really feel like
an HD - because it's the Vicker and
bigger in every dimension it's got this
rubbery coating on the back making it
feel solid in hand 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top there's this
the standby button very very nice
hardware you can see it already it's a
fingerprint magnet although very easily
cleaned with a soft shirt since it is a
glass display and of course this
kickstand does an awesome job propping
it up on a table like so for watching
videos keeping tabs on a I am
conversation that you're having or lots
of other different utilities side by
side you can definitely tell that the
Evo 4G and the HD 2 are related to each
other they both have this extremely
commanding massive 4.3 inch capacitive
display on the front but what you can
notice if we line these up is that the
HD 2 is less ha less whi than less thick
than the Evo 4G basically smaller in
every dimension the bezel around the
screen is even thinner on the HD 2 so we
can see that things are basically the
same at the top of the speaker we don't
have a front-facing video camera here on
the age
jeetu going down we have this huge
screen and then buttons although on the
hd2 they are physical buttons and on the
Evo 4G they are actually flat completely
flush and capacitive so let's turn it
over to the side the volume rocker on
the Evo 4G is actually on the other side
which is kind of unique all all HTC
devices as of late has have had the
volume rocker on the left side not there
right flipping over to the back we can
see the difference in camera we can see
both have a dual LED flash although the
hd2 does not have a kickstand you can
get the extended battery which will give
you a kickstand we actually did a review
on pocket now of that then on the other
side of the device where there is
nothing over here we've got the the
volume up and down rocker here so let's
see if I can actually turn this on and
get some 4G coverage immediately I'm not
sure if I get 4G here at my apartment I
know I get it just down the road so I'm
going to turn it on and see what happens
for the first time the battery is
already in it looks like the battery was
completely discharged so I just plugged
in so that I could show you what the
first steps are like after you turn on
the device so I'm going to press and
hold and we'll boot it up for the first
time alright then here it goes it says
HTC EVO 4G I'm quite excited to see what
happens next
Wow nice little 4G animation
prepare an SD card this comes with an 8
gigabyte micro SD card so I'm going to
slide this down and let's let's see what
happens next
I'm watching the the bar up here to see
if I get 4G wow it's really amazing to
see Android on such a large screen this
is really amazing so I'm going to
actually switch on 4G and see if that
does anything again I'm not sure if I
have 4G here in my apartment I know it's
right down the street let's see what
happens
nice full signal here right now we're on
3G and it looks like it's trying to dial
out to the 4G network well that happens
just want to explore a little bit
very very smooth as the 1 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor very
impressive indeed ok so we've got the
switch up on 4G though I'm still seeing
3G up there oh wow there it is it says
4G check that out 4G ok so let's go onto
the internet do a quick speed test just
out of the box here and without doing
anything else and see exactly what kind
of speeds we're dealing with here it
looks like it went back to 3G that's odd
so I'm going to go to pocketnow.com
huge on-screen keyboard just like you
would get on the HTC hd2 this feels a
lot better than it does on the Google
Nexus One so right now we're apparently
over 4G and this is coming through quite
fast though not super fast ok so here we
are
what I'm gonna do real quick is download
the speedtest.net application which does
a really good job benchmarking speed
I'll be right back okay and I've got the
speedtest.net application installed
let's launch it all right and we're
stover 4G I'm gonna begin test let's see
what we do over 4G right now it looks
like my 4G signal is quite low right now
we're getting 3G speeds even though
we're on the 4G so 1.5 which like I said
is expected of a 3G network I'll test
this again in a second just to confirm
upload speeds really aren't that great
but I have to test this in a few
different locations to really find where
the the strength is the best so I'm
gonna test again and again we are over
4G Oh buddy so not terribly impressive
if we get a stronger signal on 4G I'm
sure these numbers would be a lot higher
okay so I've gone into another room
where I am getting one bar of 4G or it's
actually switching back and forth
between 3G and 4G I'm gonna wait a
second till it goes back to fourth there
it goes and I'm gonna test it again see
if this helps
looks like we are getting a little bit
faster definitely faster we're gonna get
up to two megabits per second Wow it's
quite quite a improvement over last time
although nowhere near the theoretical
maximums we're gonna move jump around
town with this device to see if we can
hit the 10 megabits per second sorry for
the shaky camera off the tripod right
now so a lot more coming up on the
spread Evo 4G be sure to give the video
a thumbs up if you like what you see and
subscribe to our channel for plenty more
videos about this sexy new phone on
Sprint that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
