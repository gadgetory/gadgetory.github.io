pocket nail calm back when the hd2 is
released we were left wondering when is
the android version of this amazing
phone going to be released this device
has a beautiful huge screen it's super
thin and it grabs attention wherever you
go we finally have the answer it's the
sprint EVO 4g it's the first 4g
smartphone in the united states being
able to take advantage of the wimax
network that sprint has built up in
collaboration with clearwire this means
that you can get maximum download speeds
of about 10 megabits per second whether
that matters we're going to talk about
that in a future video because a lot of
people are wondering does 4G even matter
right now is there anything that can
really take advantage of it and we're
going to talk about that soon I've
actually got 4g in my area so I'm going
to be able to test the smartphone as it
was intended I can't wait to get to the
unboxing let's take a look at the evo 4g
on sprint let's do it now all right so
let's get to the unboxing
okay let's get past everything go right
to the device I'm going to peel off the
protective coating here beautiful
gorgeous screen on this 4.3 inches we
have these flat capacitive buttons
versus the HTC hd2 which has the
hardware buttons we're going to do a
comparison of that in a second let's
look around the device got this 8
megapixel camera with a dual LED flash
this is really cool kickstand which I
think actually makes the device bigger
because of it and what's cool is that
the red area behind these this back
battery cover shows through here and up
here so if we take off the back battery
cover you'll see that it's actually read
so a nice little touch there snap this
back on sometimes it's difficult to get
it on evenly so just pop it on there
like so we've got the front facing video
camera for video chat and beyond that it
looks like an hd2 it doesn't really feel
like an hd2 because it's the vicar and
bigger in every dimension it's got this
rubbery coating on the back making it
feel solid in hand 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top this is the
standby button very very nice hardware
you can see it already it's a
fingerprint magnet although very easily
cleaned with a soft shirt since it is a
glass display and of course this
kickstand does an awesome job propping
it up on a table like so for watching
videos keeping tabs on a I am
conversation that you're having or lots
of other different utilities side by
side you can definitely tell that the
evo 4G and the hd2 are related to each
other they both have this extremely
commanding massive 4.3 inch capacitive
display on the front but when you can
notice if we line these up is that the
hd2 is less tall less wide and less
thick than the evo 4G basically smaller
in every dimension the bezel around the
screen is even thinner on the hd2 so we
can see that things are basically the
same at the top of the speaker we don't
have a front facing video camera here on
the hd2 going down we have this huge
screen and then buttons although on the
HD
they are physical buttons and on the EVO
4G they are actually flat completely
flush and capacitive so let's turn it
over to the side the volume rocker on
the EVO 4G is actually on the other side
which is kind of unique all HTC devices
as of late has had the volume rocker on
the left side not there right flipping
over to the back we can see the
difference in camera we can see both
have a dual LED flash although the hd2
does not have a kickstand you can get
the extended battery which will give you
a kickstand we actually did a review on
pocket now of that then on the other
side of the device where there is
nothing over here we've got the volume
up and down rocker here so let's see if
I can actually turn this on and get some
4G coverage immediately I'm not sure if
I get 4G here at my apartment I know I
get it just down the road so I'm going
to turn it on and see what happens for
the first time the battery is already in
it looks like the battery was completely
discharged so i just plugged in so that
i could show you what the first steps
are like after you turn on the device so
i'm going to press and hold and will
boot it up for the first time alright
and here it goes it says HTC evo 4g i'm
quite excited to see what happens next
well nice little 4g animation
preparing SD card this comes with an 8
gigabyte microSD card so I'm going to
slide this down and let's let's see what
happens next i'm watching the the bar up
here to see if i get 4g wow it's really
amazing to see android on such a large
screen this is really amazing so i'm
going to actually switch on 4g and see
if that does anything again i'm not sure
if i have 4g here my apartment i know
it's right down the street let's see
what happens nice full signal here right
now we're on 3g and it looks like it's
trying to dial out to the 4g network
well that happens just want to explore a
little bit very very smooth as the 1
gigahertz qualcomm snapdragon processor
very impressive indeed okay so we've got
the switch up on 4g but i'm still seeing
3g up there oh wow there it is it says
4g check that out 4G okay so let's go
onto the internet do a quick speed test
just out of the box here without doing
anything else and see exactly what kind
of speeds we're dealing with here it
looks like it went back to 3g that's odd
so i'm going to go to pocketnow.com huge
on-screen keyboard just like you would
get on the HTC hd2 this feels a lot
better than it does on the google nexus
one so right now we're apparently over
4g and this is coming through quite fast
though not super fast ok so here we are
what I'm going to do real quick is
download the speedtest.net application
which does a really good job
benchmarking speed I'll be right back
okay and I've got the speedtest.net
application installed let's launch it
alright and we're stover for GM what it
begin test let's see what we do over 4g
right now it looks like my 4g signal is
quite low right now we're getting 3g
speeds even though we're on the 4g so
1.5 which like I said is expected of a
3g network I'll test this again in a
second just to confirm upload speeds
really aren't that great but I have to
test this in a few different locations
to really find where the the strength is
the best so I'm going to test again and
again we are over 4 g.o.d so not
terribly impressive if we get a stronger
signal 4G I'm sure these numbers would
be a lot higher okay so gone into
another room where I am getting one bar
of 4g or it's actually switching back
and forth between 3g and 4g went to wait
a second till it goes back to fourth
there it goes and i'm going to test it
again see if this helps looks like we
are getting a little bit faster
definitely faster we're going to get up
to 2 megabits per second wow it's quite
quite a improvement over last time
although nowhere near the theoretical
maximum is we're going to move jump
around town with this device to see if
we can hit the 10 megabits per second
sorry for the shaky camera off the
tripod right now so a lot more coming up
on the sprint EVO 4g be sure to give the
video a thumbs up if you like what you
see and subscribe to our channel for
plenty more videos about this sexy new
phone on sprint that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
