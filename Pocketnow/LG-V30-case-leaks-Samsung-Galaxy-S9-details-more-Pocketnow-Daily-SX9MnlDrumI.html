show us the final design elements rumors
of the galaxy s 9 have begun because
they're never too early and believe it
or not Google classes making a comeback
from the dead I'm Jaime Rivera and if
you're liking the memes on our Facebook
page
trust me the jokes are good because
they're not mine this is fucking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals of you are in the market for a
very inexpensive smartphone Amazon's
exclusive prime deal of the Moto G 4
it's currently available with its 16
gigabyte variant for just 120 bucks but
wait a second if you want the 32
gigabyte one you just paid $10 more I
don't even know why people would ever
buy the 16 gigabytes and just save 10
bucks you can learn more in the
description other official news have to
do with Google glass we had shift that
topic going to drawer but it's now back
the only thing is it's the Enterprise
Edition as Project X has partnered with
companies like DHL Volkswagen among
others like Samsung and the purpose is
to use cool glasses augmented reality
features to serve the company's needs we
don't know the price tag all we know is
that things like the processing power
have improved battery life in addition
to a better camera now eight megapixels
so yeah let's see what happens with a
consumer market overall and speaking of
augmented reality for those of you that
think that the price tag on microsoft's
hololens will be crazy we think so too
there is this new mirror prism AR goggle
available and you can actually buy it
right now for $99 it connects to your
iPhone it should bring some augmented
reality the only question is what
exactly sure what it does just yet but
we can't wait to tell you more as soon
as the company provides more information
and how about if we talk about some
early Galaxy S 9 rumors because it's
never too early
it seems that well recently we talked
about the project names and what they
were going to be now we hear about the
fact that Samsung plans to not make many
changes apparently things like the
display size will remain and
one third of its going to iterate and
design and other features it makes all
the sense of the world I mean the galaxy
has eight on its own is kind of ahead of
its time and many things it's going to
be very hard for companies to replicate
what Samsung has done here so it does
make sense for the company to keep
design elements let's just see what else
does not change over time and finally
the very interesting news that they have
to do with the lgb 30 mainly because
number one we know we're going to get
into d5 number two for those of you that
were wondering if the whole dual display
thing was going to happen in the renders
that we saw recently we're not going to
happen remember case makers always gets
the early we've got some case renders
and yeah apparently it's going to look a
lot like the g6 now the problem is we
haven't really seen much of the front we
don't really know if LG plans to somehow
bring a dual display regardless anyways
it leads me to the question of the day
with all the rumors we've seen of the
Galaxy s8 sorry Galaxy Note 8 the iPhone
8 and everything do you think the LG v
30 will be another v20 which was pretty
much just not cared about by the market
not even cared about LG LG didn't even
market this phone in my case I think
it's going to happen again but it
doesn't change the fact that it's
probably going to be again one of my
favorite phones just like maybe 20 it
was a comment down below we love some of
your opinion

want to get the news earlier before the
videos filmed follow those I'm talking
