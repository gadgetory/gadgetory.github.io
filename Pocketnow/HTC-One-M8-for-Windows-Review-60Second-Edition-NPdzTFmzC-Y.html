One m8 for Windows if you're in the
market for a Windows Phone should you
buy one the answer in Pocket now is 62nd
smartphone review starting right now so
here's what's hot everything we love
about the One m8 hardware is intact
brushed aluminum finish with fancy
chamfers big bold boom sound speakers a
top-of-the-line spec sheet and some
useful and fun HTC apps plus it's
running the latest version of Windows
Phone the most capable build yet of
Microsoft's hip minimalistic platform
but that platform is in third place and
while the app gap is narrower it's still
a much smaller ecosystem the camera well
good enough for most folks is pretty low
res compared with the competition the
soft metal casing isn't hard to scratch
if you carry it outside the case and the
price tag is a Benjamin more than the
closest competition that's the price
you'll pay for beauty though and the One
m8 is one of the only windows phones
we've ever called beautiful if that's
the kind of thing that matters to you
and you don't need a super
high-resolution camera but we recommend
this device just as highly as we did
it's Android counterpart for six more
minutes on the HTC One m8 for Windows
