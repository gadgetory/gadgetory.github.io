pocketnow.com and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which review five applications
in 30 seconds each so let's get started
fruit ninja is a paper game that cost 99
cents on the android market the object
of the game is pretty simple all you
have to do is move your finger across
you can move one or two fingers or how
many you want to use on the screen to
slice the fruit in half and the object
of the game is to split the fruit and
get this the highest score you can so i
will continue playing here and what i
want to do is slice the fruit map and if
i go to a part where there's a bomb if I
don't want to slice the bomb in half or
miss a fruit let's say that I miss this
fruit it gives me an X here and then if
I hit too many of them I lose and if i
hit the bomb of course the game is over
calc on is a free game available in the
android market the object of the game is
to conquer these neutral planets before
your enemy conquers them and tries to
conquer your own planet so you have a
certain number of troops on each planet
and what you want to do is click on the
planet and select the adjacent planets
and you want to conquer these planets
before your enemy conquers those planets
and once you fill up the entire screen
with planets then you can conquer their
planet so now i have conquered all the
planets and i can move on to the next
map food network in the kitchen is a
paid for application that cost one
dollar ninety-nine cents on the android
market so we have all of our top chefs
here from the food network so we can
pick any of their recipes we can go down
here to the menu button click search
found feature choose the recipe box or
go to a shopping list so all I'm to do
is click on one of these let's say I
want to click on this and I want to go
to baking I can select a recipe here and
it gives me an overview of the recipe so
let's say I wanted to add the
ingredients to my click Add to go to
shopping list and now I can use my
android device at the grocery store move

android market that allows you to upload
one gigabyte up music to the move

different social networking sites at

something gear and I can either create a
title if I want where I can just put out

Twitter it'll actually post a link
directing you to the post dress website
