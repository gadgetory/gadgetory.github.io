second half of the year flagship phablet
we've got to spend a little time talking
about that juan carlos wagon out here
for pocket now and it's time to share
our first impressions of the huawei mate
10 pro because this is one sexy sexy
smartphone this is a trend we absolutely
love coming from a manufacturer like
huawei the packaging and presentation
this experience out of the box is simply
fantastic not only getting the phone a
cable and a charger but also you know of
course the mandatory headphone dongle
since this doesn't have a built-in 3.5
millimeter headphone jack a pair of ear
pods style headphones and one of my
favorite additions on huawei devices has
always been some type of case or cover
you spend a lot of money on a phone and
out of the box you want to feel like
you've got everything you need to take
advantage of all of the features of the
device jumping right into aesthetics and
design this is a sexy piece of
engineering it's this wonderful grown-up
blend of previous huawei design accents
looking like the mate nine in the Nova
series the visor from the Nexus 6p all
of these little touches adding up to a
device which is wonderfully symmetrical
no other flagship right now is doing as
good a job of balancing all of these
little design elements from the center
positioned fingerprint sensor to the
sensors and the flash bridging the dual
camera lenses this is excellent design
arriving at that flashier look we are
using glass and I'm personally not the
biggest fan of glass back phones I think
they're a little too slippery this is
definitely going to be a massive
fingerprint magnet which again why we're
so happy to see Huawei not only include
a bumper case this is a plastic bumper
case but they've moved on from their
hard plastic snap-on cases this is a
slightly more absorbent and flexible
skin to protect your may 10 versus the
hard plastic snap-on shell which I did
actually snap one of these I did crack
one of them on my mate nine so this is
another excellent consumer evolution
titanium gray is a great look for this
phone and it's just got a really nice
feel in the hand we're talking about the
two by one aspect ratio for this display
bringing it right in line with phones
like the LGV 30 in terms of size and and
how you need to move the device around
in your hand to navigate the UI reach
your notification shade or those bottom
mounted controls Huawei opting for a
full HD OLED panel 2160 by 1080 it
hasn't bothered me in this first day of
use one thing I will be considering is
what effect this might have on something
like VR where current Samsung and LG
flagships have actually been kind of fun
to throw into my pixel daydream VR
viewer headset it's one of those
situations for daily use you're not
really missing out on anything and even
scaling this down into the low-power
720p mode screen still looks pretty good
I've already thrown on a couple of my
favorite games and performance is about
what you would expect for a modern 2017
flagship grindin marvel future fight for
a couple hours already
battery life actually does seem to be
just a little bit improved from where we
were on the excellent mate 9 so the die
shrink on the kuren 970 CPU does seem to
be bringing some power efficiency to the
table when we're also talking about a
premium phablet with one of the largest
battery capacities available I was a
little concerned where Huawei was going
with some of their power user features
on the p10 but I am ridiculously happy
to point out that this phone does have
an IR blaster in a household where my
precocious toddler likes to hide the TV
remote and we can't quite do everything
through Android and chromecast plugins
it's nice just to have the raw power to
change channels turn the TV on and off
or control the volume yesterday for
example our TV remote was in the doc
mcstuffins checkup bag which it did take
us a little while to ferret out where
she'd hidden it this time and we're
nowhere near completing any kind of real
camera review but I did have to take the
dual shooters out for a spin and
everything that I love about Huawei plus
Leica cameras is on display here not to
mention some of the best portrait mode
cutout work I've seen from any current
flagships fairly busy background here
and the may 10 Pro did an excellent job
of cutting out around not only my face
and my headphones but also my flat cap
lastly the early
on audio are a little bit mixed what's
interesting is the mate 10 Pro seems to
use some kind of analog pin out for the
3.5 millimeter headset it is actually
compatible this phone actually is
compatible with Motorola's solution for
a headphone dongle so the dongle does
not act like a USB audio device but the
headphones are recognized as a USB see
audio device they do have their own DAC
and amp built into this plug so when you
move this port from the phone to a
laptop with USB C or another USB C phone
it will show up as a proper USB audio
device that'll be a little confusing for
folks on some kind of legacy USB gear
this isn't gonna work like the Google
pixel 2 headphone dongle where you can
take the headphone dongle directly to
phone to laptop without having to unplug
your headphones from the dongle but at
least there was some consideration for
how folks might use a USB C audio device
on the headphones one step forward one
small step back but ultimately we are
seeing progress on Android devices
properly supporting USB audio so we'll
call that a thumbs up ish for now folks
this phone gives off a stonking good
first impressions we're gonna be digging
into this phone much more aggressively
testing out the cameras testing out the
battery life testing out the audio and
the stereo speakers and we're gonna
report back with a full review coming up
right quick if you have any questions
about what to cover for the mate 10 Pro
especially as we're getting into the end
of the year what phones you might want
to see it compared against definitely
drop us a comment down below this video
