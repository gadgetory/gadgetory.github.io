how easily you can customize it to your
liking I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are the best
third-party launchers for Android
customization is the name of the game
when it comes to Android unlike its two
largest competitors Windows Phone and
iOS the appearance of the UI is at the
hands of the user sure on iOS you can
jailbreak and install various themes and
icon packs through Cydia and on Windows
Phone you can rearrange your home screen
tiles and change their color but a
virtually endless list of changes can be
made to Android straight out of the box
without voiding any warranties anyone
can do it and it's as simple as
installing an application or to one of
the easiest ways to do just that is
through using launcher or Home
Replacement applications which are
widely available in Google Play with so
many options out there however it makes
choosing just one rather difficult even
worse not every launcher is the same and
they target different types of users due
to that here are the best launchers in
different categories
first up the utilitarian these launchers
are for users who seek the utmost
functionality in their home screen these
specific launchers are highly
customizable packed with a ton of
features and can be tweaked to virtually
no end if you prefer blazing speed over
flashy animations fine you can make that
change you can tweak everything from the
grid size a number of home screens to
how the app drawer looks and individual
icons which can be customized one by one
the cream of the crop in this category
are nova launcher and apex launcher
while apex isn't a bad option mobile
launcher seems to be the fan favorite
mainly because it provides more polished
and more intricate settings toggles and
tweaks for things you never thought
you'd need seriously
the developers Tesla coil software
thought of everything that name goes a
long way in our book - nova launcher is
available for free but the fully
featured premium version will set you
back $4 a worthy price if your phone
stock launcher is driving you nuts not
everyone wants to spend 10 hours setting
up their homescreen though and they
don't want to spend a lot of time
digging around through pages of
applications or flipping through a
carousel of home screens for people like
that the pragmatic there is currently
only one option action launcher it's a
no-nonsense launcher which strictly
adheres to the Android design guidelines
unlike the typical Android launcher
there is no application drawer
instead applications are accessed
through what is called the quick drawer
hidden to the left of your home screen
this can be accessed by the soft button
in the upper left corner or a rightward
swipe from the left edge of the display
swiping left from the right edge will
also reveal the quick page or a panel
displaying a few of your chosen widgets
as well as most recent applications
enabling one swipe in the settings makes
quick drawer and quick page available
from within any application one of the
most unique and helpful features is
called covers a folder which acts as an
application shortcut when tapped but
reveals the entire contents of the
folder when swiped upwards for the
record there are several customization
options in action launcher settings such
as the ability to set the number of home
screens the grid size dark size and
tweak other aesthetic changes but the
sole purpose of action launcher is
efficiency and it succeeds if that with
flying colors it's extremely quick with
a small learning curve once you get
accustomed to action launcher it's hard
to settle for less until last week
action launcher was a premium only
application but the developer opened it
up and made it free to use with a
premium unlock which normally runs for
$4 Britt is currently on sale for a
dollar ninety-nine there is however one
other pragmatic launcher which is a bit
newer and still an invite-only private
beta 88 it automatically adapts to your
day to give you relevant information not
unlike Google now except this is far
more in-depth and all-encompassing
it categorizes your applications
delivers different spaces based on
context whether you're driving just
waking up or out to dinner again this
one is still in private beta but it's a
launcher for those who only care about
seeing the relevant information at any
given time send up the beta wait for
your code and try it out
others prefer far more customized
Android experience one which is
completely unique and well gorgeous for
them there are a handful of great
one-click themed launchers such as Budds
launcher and femur when you first
install these applications you are
prompted to browse a list of ready-made
themes pick the one which appeals to you
the most let it download and enjoy your
fresh clean beautiful new home screen
this style of launcher is great for
those who get tired of their phones UI
quickly as completely renovating your
home screen can be done in a matter of
seconds find a new theme you like
download and apply if you have the time
to dedicate to it you can also heavily
customize the appearance of pre-made
themes to your liking though that can
get quite involved and in depth
femur is still in beta but both are free
of charge finally the purest this is the
user who is tired of all the muck and
simply wants to get back to the basics
KitKat launcher is a third-party remake
of the google experience launcher found
on the nexus 5 it's not a dead ringer
and the Google now integration isn't
quite as polished as the real deal but
Kit Kat launcher is an excellent way to
get that nexus field on all compatible
devices with minimal effort so what kind
of Android user are you of all the
launches available which is your
favorite personally I'm a no-nonsense
kind of guy and for me it's definitely
action launcher I've been an advocate of
Chris Lacey's work since the beginning
and the developer continues to raise the
bar with each and every update it's a
fantastic launcher I simply could not
get enough of but a v8 is a very very
close second that's going to do it for
