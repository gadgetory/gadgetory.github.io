here is the 1 plus X so at the front of
you have a 5 inch AMOLED panel is a
1080p display and it's a very very thin
phone the metal edges are actual real
metal machine they have a nice little
groove to them as you can see here at
the bottom here you've got micro USB
unfortunately note I've see here this
time around but I can see the speakers
on the left-hand side here is the same
kind of rocker we saw the little slider
that lets you select notifications off
urgent and all now on the side here on
the top here you have the headphone jack
and secondary Mike you can see now the
right hand side obviously is where the
same slot is and the power/lock key and
volume rocker so the interesting thing
about that SIM slot is that it actually
can accommodate two nano sims or one
nano sim and SD card microsc of course
so you know this is a phone with
expandable storage it does have 16
gigabytes of built-in storage though so
you're not completely in trouble if
you're not putting an SD card in there
in the back here as you can see this is
actually the ceramic version of this
phone it's really really beautiful it's
as ur kounia ceramic back so a little
more expensive for this model 369 euros
but there is obviously the the base
model here as you can see is a 13
megapixel autofocus camera with an LED
flash and the oneplus logo this does not
have a ys but it has phase detection
autofocus is f over 2.2 underneath here
is a roughly 2500 milliamp hour battery
should last you quite a while and it's
powered by a snapdragon 801 back to the
old days to three gigs of ram as well
which is pretty awesome the front facing
camera up here is an 8 megapixel and you
get the speaker at the top and other
sensors you scaly see the antenna gaps
here as well so yeah it's a small phone
feels really great in hand especially
this ceramic version which is a little
hefty which is nice
and then you can see that in terms of
specs it's a pretty much competes with
things like the Moto G in some ways and
certainly in price obliterates the
mortgagee still no NFC though so
remember that so as you can see down
here and it's not really that obvious
but they are Keys embedded in the glass
so you can obviously replace that with
software keys if you prefer that's
typical 1 plus but you know the software
is nice and snappy is really no
complaints here everything works just
great and oxygen west of course
unfortunately this one hasn't been set
up very much but you can see the camera
app here typical 1 plus camera of course
and let's see the web browser has a meet
set up but here's the notification tray
you can see everything snappy about
phone here yep and it's running lollipop
of course still five point one point one
oxygen OS 2.1 nothing to complain about
nothing unusual here so this 1 plus X
will be available in the u.s. starting
november nineteenth by invitation
obviously for 249 US dollars so there
you have it the oneplus X here in San
Francisco at the launch event and we'll
have more in our review stay tuned
