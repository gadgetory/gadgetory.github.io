recent days we've shown you videos about
how you can talk to your phone and have
it do things for you for example we've
shown you how to use Google search with
your voice we've shown you how to use
text input with your voice well today
we're going to show you something called
voice actions and this is something you
guys have been waiting for it's been
around for a little while we just
haven't done a video on it because it
requires Android 2.2 plus some
prerequisites it's really cool and it
will do a lot of stuff using the power
of your voice and your Android powered
smart phone let's go take a look alright
so first of all do you remember stuff
like this this is the HP iPAQ H 4100
it's a pocket PC that's way back in the
day before they were called Windows
Mobile or Windows Phone devices and this
wasn't a phone it was however what was
called a PDA or a personal digital
assistant now why do I bring this up
well if you think of an assistant that's
generally speaking is someone who helps
you get your job done helps you make
your life easier they're the person who
signs for packages when you can't
they're the person who answers and
screens your phones they're the person
that you can dictate memos to letters to
emails to and they send them off for you
in your behalf they're the person who
schedules meetings just all kinds of
stuff well that's really what these PDAs
were supposed to do well today we've got
even more powerful PDAs
that now have mobile internet
connectivity with them and they have
just all kinds of stuff over here there
was an app back then we called them
programs that I could get that would let
me literally speak to my PDA and have it
do things not quite as advanced as what
we can do today with Android but we
could still do it now what I'm running
here is a t-mobile g2 it is running a
CyanogenMod nightly which is running
Gingerbread or Android 2.3 you don't
need to be using that in
Android 2.2 will work just fine 2.1
isn't gonna be able to give you all the
advantages that you'd be able to get
then i'm gonna show you here but you'll
still have some stuff that you can do
so really 2.2 and above is the sweet
spot next off you're going to need to go
to the market and download two things
the first thing is the google search
widget now you might think well I've
already got the Google search widget on
my phone no you don't you'll need to go
to the market and you'll need to get it
the difference is this one has a G with
a little drop down menu on it that lets
you select what stuff you want to search
for it is different than that the search
widget that comes pre-installed on most
Android phones so you'll want to make
sure you get that second thing is
something called Google Voice Search or
just voice search it is by Google and it
adds what are called
intense now an intent is kind of just
like it sounds it's not intense
it's an intent meaning I'm not going to
tell you exactly what I want you to do
I'm going to tell you what I intend for
you to do and then of course the phone
interprets what that intent is and it
handles it it carries it out for you
so you'll need to get those two apps
they are free they are in the
marketplace you cannot see them unless
you have Android 2.2 or above so I'll
let you go and do that now if you want
to pause the video and come back you can
do that if you want to watch it through
all the way that's great if you do pause
the video subscribe to the video channel
so you can make sure you can come back
and get the rest of it so okay since
you're back I'm assuming that you either
have already done that or you just want
to get the information so what we're
gonna do now is well really some cool
stuff and it all focuses around either
tapping on a voice search shortcut like
we have on my desktop here and that's
really just for illustration purposes
because I have a search button down at
the bottom and by long pressing on that
I can invoke the same thing as I can
here so what we're gonna do Google has
called these voice actions their actions
that you can carry out with your voice
and tell you your phone to do stuff so
we're going to long press here and I'm
just gonna talk and it's going to show
you on the microphone moving up and down
that it's listening to me it's gonna try
and recognize this which we really don't
care about it's not gonna know what to
do but the reason that I want to show
you this there's word is working is you
can get to this and you can of course if
it's a text input box you can search
excuse me you can type words with just
your voice if it's a Google search box
you can input text into that and hit
search and search that with your voice
so all kinds of neat stuff now two
things up front first of all you can see
I have a server problem that means that
all that information that was just
recorded was attempted to be sent off to
Google servers so that Google servers
could crunch all that information and
figure out what I'm saying the more I
talk to my phone not talk to people on
my phone but actually talked to the
phone using this this voice search
functionality or the text input
functionality the better it's going to
get and recognizing my voice and
figuring out what I mean now that is
we've talked about it before or
something for a conspiracy theorist
because you're sending that information
off to Google so Google is technically
building a profile of your voice on
their servers so they can understand
what you sound like basically they're
they're creating a fingerprint of your
voice if you don't like that it's turned
off by default but if you want to turn
it on you can go ahead and do that in
the settings over here how the second
thing is this is on a flat table now
last time I color the keyboard so you
know go ahead and laugh at me at my
expense I make mistakes too was really
kind of funny this is a table it's a
flat surface and you'll notice that on a
lot of HTC devices and some others
there's this little teeny microphone on
the back now that does a couple things
you've got a mic on the back you've got
a mic on the front down here and both of
them work together to help figure out
what you're saying the one on the back
is primarily used for something called
active noise cancellation so it's
listening to the background noise and
it's listening to the foreground noise
it's applying the two and basically
subtract
doing the two waveforms from each other
so all of the background noise that's
coming in if you're on a busy street if
you're on an airplane in a work
environment it's going to attempt to
subtract anything that it hears from the
mic in the back from anything that hears
from the mic in the front and that it
assumes is your voice so keep that in
mind for this demo being on a flat table
I'm kind of blocking that back
microphone it doesn't just do noise
cancellation it also helps get a more
full fingerprint of your voice and apply
that altogether I know it sounds kind of
funny but voice recognition is going to
be diminished because of how I have this
set up to make it work well hold it up
to your phone or up to your face like
you would phone and talk to it that way
or hold it out in front of you in a
quiet room you know that just the
typical stuff about voice recognition
applies so let's go ahead and get
started and see exactly what we can do
what I've done is I've long pressed on
my search button and then I hit the Help
button rather than the cancel button and
that brings up this it's a very quick
tutorial and in fact over here at the
beginning it has a video that you can
watch to see how to do all this stuff
and give some examples I would highly
recommend that you go ahead and do that
I'm going to show you a lot of the stuff
that it has but it's always good to see
things from two different perspectives
so keep that in mind the first thing
that we're going to do I've created a
new contact on here called John Doe he's
my really good friend he lives out in
Washington DC and well he does some some
political stuff for well you'll see in
just a little bit so I'm gonna show you
what we can do probably one of the most
common things that we're going to want
to do is call somebody so here we go
let's see if we can call John Doe
call John Doe and while that recognizes
it comes back here and it says hey look
I've got a John Doe at home I've got a
John Doe on his mobile I can do a search
for call John Doe I can call B John Doe
call of John Doe so these are the things
that it thinks I might have said that it
doesn't have a voice action associated
with and that it'll do a search
searching primarily just Google just the
Internet
sometimes it will search stuff on your
phone as well but here if I want to call
him at home I can tap and call right
there so I long pressed said call John
Doe I press and it works great but that
still might be a little too much if I'm
in a car so let's do something else
let's get a little more specific call
John Doe at home so now I've said who I
want to call and to call him at home it
gives me a minute before it goes through
and does the dialing and the reason is
in case it got the wrong person you can
cancel out of that now of course I don't
want to call John Doe at home so I'm
going to cancel that and we're going to
go back to that screen where now it says
hey you cancelled out of that did you
really mean something else it gives you
another opportunity but if I have a work
number if I have a mobile number if I
have you know a whole bunch of different
numbers associated with John Doe I can
very quickly and easily with one voice
action one intent tell my phone to call
John Doe at his home or on mobile so
that's all pretty simple pretty easy to
understand right all right let's move on
to the next one so similar to phone
calling of course is texting it's
something that we all do all the time so
let's go ahead and send a text over to
my friend John Doe send text to John Doe
I'll be late for lunch today stuck in
traffic let that recognized and over
here is sending a text to John Doe it
automatically defaulted to his mobile
device and it says I'll be late for
lunch today stuck in traffic of course
Albie
not what I meant but that's what it
heard partially because I've got a
really thick accent that's sarcasm by
the way guys but mostly because of the
way that I've got my setup I've got it
on this table which we already talked
about so I can come in here and tap on
that word and you'll notice it was in
blue now that means that it's not
entirely certain that that's what you
meant to say when you tap on it it
brings up this little quick correct I
can delete it of course with the delete
button you can pull up my on-screen
keyboard with the keyboard button or I
can even hit the microphone and have it
listen to my voice again and just
correct that little bit so let's go
ahead and try that well of course we
also have these quick corrects up here
on the top I'll be is what I wanted it
to say so I could select that but since
this is all about voice let's go ahead
and do that I'll be and I slowed it down
a little bit and you can see it got it
even worse so let's go ahead and just
delete and deed we'll come back in here
and say I'll be in there so I'll be and
it lost light in there so if we'd gone
through and selected it right the first
time we could have just sent it off very
quickly very easily but you can see how
this lets you go in and make a very
quick text message that now when I send
it it's going to send this off using my
default text message handler whether
that's handset whether that is the
built-in messaging app whether that is
Google Voice text messages which is what
mine is configured to do obviously
that's not a valid text will phone
number so I'm going to go ahead and
cancel out of that but I can very
quickly and easily even in a car tap and
hold send a text to John Doe I'll be
late for lunch stuck in traffic and get
that set off without getting my keyboard
out and poking a whole bunch of buttons
and getting into a wreck or or being a
danger on the road so there we go what's
next of course email let's go ahead and
send an email using a voice so again
we're going to long press on the search
button send email to John Doe I'll be
late for lunch too
because I'm reviewing the new sales
proposal that recognizes it's a little
bit longer so it will take a little
longer to recognize in this case it
didn't understand what I meant because
it picked up search button so let's go
ahead and try that again send email to
John Doe I'll be late for lunch today
while I review the sales proposal again
it recognizes and there you go you'll
notice this is not your email client
just like the last one though it was not
your text messaging window this is a new
kind of intent box I don't know what the
name of it is if we've got any Android
developers out there please let us know
in the comments so that we can call it
the right thing and so that all the the
watchers all the viewers know what it is
but you can see here it went ahead and
found John Doe shows me his email
address just so you know if I've got two
john doe's in here I know I'm sending it
to the right one and here's my message
again apparently I'll be is being
interpreted as Alby
so we'll fix that I'll be late for lunch
today while I okay so that's pretty
close and I can go in and make some
changes
of course the more I use this the better
it's going to get at recognizing which
we've already said I can add a subject
just do this sales proposal I can add a
Carbon Copy I can add a blind carbon
copy I can add more to the text and then
I can go ahead and send it off so very
very powerful very fast easy to correct
and if I want this to be actually the
word be I can change it to the word be
so kind of cool let's go ahead and see
what else we can do I feel like one of
those infomercials guys but wait there's
more let's take a look at that so I've
got this sales meeting that I need to go
to with John Doe but to do that you know
I'm a late sleeper as you can tell I
mean it's 7:15 I'm probably gonna sleep
in so let's go ahead and set an alarm
but I don't want to launch the alarm app
and figure out how to do all the
I mean it's just a pain so let's do that
with our voice again tap and hold on
this set alarm for 6:30 a.m. sends that
off to Google and it sets the alarm for
oh six thirty which is 24 hour time for
6:30 a.m. we could set a label on that
if we wanted to just like we did before
sales proposal meeting now when I wake
up in the morning I'm going to know that
I'm waking up at 6:30 because of a sales
proposal meeting and I can get myself up
and out of bed so I went ahead and got
up but I'm driving around the city and I
don't know where gas stations are and I
desperately need to put gasoline in my
Prius so let's go ahead and find out how
we can can get some gas map of gas
stations now this uses Google Maps so
for this action you have to have maps
installed and what it's going to do is
it's going to look up where I am and
search for gas stations and show me a
list of all of the local gas stations
around and you can see I've got one
there one there in a whole bunch over
there now if I was going someplace like
Washington DC I could search for show me
gas stations in Washington DC and it
would use that as the location instead
of my geo-located location and do that
so very very handy but you know what now
that I've got gas in that Prius I you
know I can drive now what four or five
thousand miles on that tank of gas where
am I going to find my friend John Doe so
we can have this meeting so my buddy
John Doe and I are going to have lunch
today to discuss this sales proposal but
I need to know where to go and he's
given me an address so let's see if we
can not just get directions to but use
Google Maps Navigation to show me how to
get to this restaurant where we're going
to be navigate to a 2000 Pennsylvania
Avenue Washington DC
it recognized what I was attempting to
say and fires up google maps navigations
gets driving directions for that address
and it's gonna start talking to us here
so I'm gonna kind of try and talk over a
little bit it took a while to get the
directions and the reason for that is
because I just plotted a route from my
place
to which is out in Utah by the way guys
not real close to Washington DC all the
way out to Washington DC and it's
telling me you kind of missed it there
that this road or this route has tolls
so I'm gonna have to be aware of that
and I'm gonna have to have my my wallet
handy so I can pay some tolls but if we
zoom out we're getting the the live
track and traffic information we're
getting the route to go all the way out
I eighty across the whole country over
to Washington DC out here at the end and
it looks like I'm going to the Burrow
out in Washington DC so it's it's quite
a ways I'm probably not gonna make it
for lunch today at least not by car but
again very very easy way for you to to
navigate to wherever you're going to
know this primarily works with
businesses rather than individuals so
bear that in mind you can also speak and
address just like you saw me do there to
go to the specific location so I'm out
and I'm on my way driving in my car but
I need some tunes so let's get some
music on here now what I like to do
rather than loading up my phone with all
of my mp3 is I like to listen to Pandora
I get a lot more breadth of music
choices that way and I get introduced to
a bunch of songs that I haven't heard in
a long time or that I have never heard
of at all so I kind of like that let's
see how that ties in and I'm just gonna
choose a really abstract one off the
wall guys and a lot of you're gonna
laugh at this so please do listen to
seven by Prince right there it pulls
that up seven is a song by the artist
formerly known as a symbol who's now
known as Prince and was known as Prince
before he was a symbol and all kinds of
fun but I use that because it
humorous and Pandora takes a little bit
and I needed to fill some time with a
little humorous anecdote so what it's
done here is it's pulled up a song that
sounds like 7vy prints and that is
purple rain on the ultimate Prince album
and you can hear that a little bit
playing in the background it starts out
kind of slow and of course I only want
to play a couple seconds so we don't
have to a license the song to play to
you but it's gonna then stream that in
all the way from my house to Washington
DC as long as I've got data coverage so
really kind of cool there one last thing
that I'd like to show you although
there's probably some other stuff buried
in there that's where your comments come
into play and that one last item is a
note note to self pick up eggs milk and
cereal and what that's going to do is
it's going to recognize it put it into a
note to self and now I can send this off
to me as a Gmail or to anyone else at
that point but just kind of neat I'd
like to see this tightly integrated into
Evernote or whatever your preferred
notetaking application is it's not right
now but hopefully in the future that
will come as an update okay so as you
can see there's a lot of cool things
that you can do with Google Voice
Actions or voice intense we covered most
of them at least most that we know about
I'm sure there are a couple others that
are still floating around out there that
we haven't shown you that's where you
come in please let us know either with
the text comment down below or via a
video reply to this video showing us
your favorite intent or an intent that
we didn't cover that you think we
shouldn't have maybe we'll do a
follow-up video make sure you go ahead
and do that comments or will help us
know that we're doing the right thing
that we're making videos that you like
and help us improve if you see something
that you don't like like hey Joe this
video is way too long and yes it was
ridiculously long but we showed you a
lot of cool stuff if you liked it give
the video a thumbs up that lets your
friends know about PocketNow and all the
cool stuff and it helps us grow and
growing just means more cool stuff for
you so really it's kind of you know
self-serving but go ahead and do that no
of course we also want you
Hanover pocketnow.com and we want you to
subscribe to our video channel if you
haven't done so already doing that not
only helps us but it helps you guys too
it helps the whole community learn more
stuff and really show off all the cool
things that our devices can do for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
