about the concept of producing these
real audio reviews there was one phone I
was most thinking about running through
these tests we finally have our hands on
an LG V 20 which is not a pre-release
unit and I'm glad we waited there have
been a few little software tweaks which
have improved this phone there's already
been an update for this where the
pre-release units haven't received any
software support yet now we can get into
the more detailed analysis which we
really shouldn't have been doing on an
engineering example as we've explained
in previous videos there's only a single
speaker on the bottom of the phone and
on the opposite side of the USBC port
there's the headphone jack powered by a
quad DAC and a pretty killer amp let's
knock out speaker performance right
quick I don't think anyone's going to be
blown away by a single bottom firing
speaker but we can hear this is a nice
upgrade over last year's LG v10 this had
actually a pretty dull and uninspiring
speaker for such a monster phone in
every other respect this is easily going
to lose to any kind of stereo solution
but this does get the v20 up to that
tier we would expect of a high quality
single speaker though we'd absolutely
like to see LG move to eight front
facing speaker solution just replace
that top earpiece a la Motorola I think
that'd be pretty keen for those of you
who are interested we do have some of
our speaker sample tests linked in a
separate video you can find that in the
description below this review but what
we want to get to is the headphone jack
performance the quad DAC performance on
the lg v20 so has this phone performed
when you plug in some headphones in two
words very good in more than two words
it's a little complicated quantifying
how this thing actually does perform if
you caught RB 20 versus V 10 comparison
video we did show up how sophisticated
these headphone jacks are tailoring the
output to what device is connected to
them moving to this quad AK we see a bit
more inconsistency in the output of this
phone as compared to the v10 before it
the general fear of LG might be getting
a little too clever for its own good but
let's actually chat some numbers this
thing has few issues stomping on most
mobile audio solutions it had absolutely
no problems translating my V okay
Dack better frequency response better
signal-to-noise ratio and a louder amp
in terms of output volume these two
perform very similarly once you start
climbing up to higher impedance
headphones the v20 just keeps getting
more powerful and that's really the
situation for all of the phones that we
would compare against the b20 also we
might find an individual victory for
example the iPhone 7 has less stereo
crosstalk that's the bleed between your
left channel and your right channel but
then the v20 pretty much wins everything
else so what about a phone like the axon
7 the axon 7 was responsible for us
changing how we produced our audio
reviews it was so loud what's been
preventing us from seeing the true final
output of the V 20 is its sophisticated
headphone jack connecting it to the line
input on my audio interface the phone
would detect that it was connected to a
line input while if it's connected to a
line input I don't need to send the
hottest possible signal so it would
actually reduce output volume going
through a bunch of janky little adapters
and connectors I found a way to trick
the phone into thinking it was still
connected to high impedance cans and
what do we see we see a phone that is
just a decibel behind the axon 7 going
through a splitter so when we see that
waveform which is nearly overloading my
audio interface I'm assuming we could
probably add on another 2 decibels at
least just because it's going through
this piece of crap Y adapter splitter
here we do have a few concerns though
the V 20 has proven to be one of the
most difficult phones for us to get any
kind of consistent baseline on what this
thing can produce especially using our
synthetic benchmarks what was most
troubling with the V 20 was a series of
playthroughs where the phone seemed to
be truncating to 16-bit audio and also
opposite the v10 we see just a little
bit more manipulation of the signal
through most of the files that we're
playing that's not to say that there's
more noise or your audio files are being
degraded but this quad DAC system in
making all of these tiny little
adjustments seems to be sprinkling in
just a little bit more juice to make
your audio file sound better
I can totally envision some scenarios
where purists might not appreciate that
what's a long and rambling way to
describe what we were seeing
during our synthetic benchmarks getting
away from the
number generating machines popping in
some headphones and just taking a listen
to what the v20 can produce this is my
favorite performer of the year it's bold
and it's loud on a decent pair of
headphones
I really can't listen past halfway
before it starts getting really
uncomfortable and this phone does a
beautiful job of reproducing every
single musical genre that I've thrown at
it from live recordings of classical and
orchestrated music all the way up to
really limited and loud electronica and
hip-hop and rock the highs will Sparkle
without becoming piercing the bass will
definitely rumble your skull and there's
enough power in this system to make sure
that the mids are well represented for
all of those really crunchy distortion
effects on guitars what you're paying
for in this phone is a device
sophisticated enough to tailor its
output to whatever headphones you
connect to it
this phone is going to try and make sure
that it's sending you the best possible
audio signal regardless of how expensive
or inexpensive your headphones are all
out of a lowly old fashioned 3.5
millimeter jack I still happen to think
that's pretty impressive for a phone
it's just that this year it's a little
bit twitchy er than what we had last
year as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more reviews like these I
will definitely be doing more real audio
reviews on phones as they come out we're
going to circle back to a few more
devices that were released earlier in
the year and definitely be on the
lookout for the real camera review
coming soon now that we have finished
consumer retail hardware for the b-24
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram and
I will catch you all on the next review
alright when we first started hahaha
my voice is not warmed up at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
