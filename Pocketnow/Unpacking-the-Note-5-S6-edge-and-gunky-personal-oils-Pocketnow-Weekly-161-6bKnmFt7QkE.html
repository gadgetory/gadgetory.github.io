city Rosie good touch you rollin a
together here we go if there's one thing
I've learned in my several decades of
existence on this planet it's that the
universe has a kind of built-in balance
for the purposes of wheat gadget geeks
that means that when a big name brand
drops a couple new shiny expensive
ingots of premium tech there's usually
an underdog not far away doing something
similar for a lot less we're going to
talk about the ends of the smartphone
tech spectrum today on episode 16 one of
the pocket not weekly the once-a-week
podcast where we discuss news and
opinion from the world of mobile
technology than smartphones tablets
wearables all that stuff you wish you
had when you were a kid on location in
New York City today I'm your host and
 another reviews editor michael
fisher and i'm joined by an old friend
and a name familiar to all of you out

cutting it close and I'm the one that's
like yeah josh is challenge is match

something hopefully resembling a podcast
at wer s studios in boston the time is
precisely 350 p.m. eastern seaboard good
afternoon everybody if you ever
experienced boredom you might like what
I'm about to tell you you guys are going
to hate this an outfit created by former
pocketnow editor Taylor Martin has an
online store with a variety of boredom
crushing do-it-yourself kits I told you
were gonna hate it cuz you're gonna want
all this stuff now that's the problem
we're talking about mod in a box folks
recently they added a cold brew coffee
kit to their store for just 13 bucks
because of course they did Taylor's well
known for his love of coffee free
shipping on that by the way now it lets
you join the cold brew coffee revolution
so that you can make your own delicious
cold brew coffee right at home are you
are you a member of the cold brew
revolution now cold brew no no I am poor
okay copy wow wow I remember you saying
that cuz it makes you so jittery yeah
thirty-three percent of the podcast is
on board the cold brew revolution train
so it's okay included in the box is
enough premium coffee picked by Taylor
it's curated coffee to make a delicious
batch right away this summer I've been
buying expensive cold brew coffee by the
cup from my local coffee joint which is
true i buy a lottery from starbucks but
by making the stuff yourself you can
save a lot of chet along with the cold
brew coffee get they also sell DIY hair
pomade which is what's holding together
my hairdo as well as a DIY solar phone

modern a box calm / kits to clarify yeah
I do love Colbridge don't make it myself
okay fixed your damn long that's good to
know yeah I need I need you guys to talk
in 15 seconds or 25 seconds but I
actually have to read this it's all more
thing I don't want to when I wouldn't
understand but don't want to read this
book
and now this tis I the captain of two
phones and you might have seen me on the
tube I don't usually read lame-ass
poetry unless I'm in a good mood every
time I get a samsung phone I want to
disable knocks but if you want to do
something rewarding go visit mod in a
box that's a poem that I didn't write
you didn't right now I sure didn't okay
smile that's right so anyway folks we're
here and at a breather space is all
three of us our first time in a breather
sort of time shared governance room
space yeah never heard of it before but
it's working out well so far it's nice
and everything possible Holden here and
his unlimited tootsie rolls get your
time I don't understand one more in
there in a beaker yeah there's a couple
Edison bulbs so I apologize for the
bounce although it's not as much audio
bounces I thought there might be but
we're here to talk for the next half
hour it's gonna be a very short
installation of the pocket at weekly
because tomorrow goes north carolina
we're here to talk about two devices now
three devices two of which were released
just today here in New York City with us
are you sure I dude feels like they were
very familiar right yeah as dawn Brendan
Esposito said it feels like we've been
to this event before yep we're talking
folks about the samsung galaxy s6 edge+
right you could have stopped right there
Alex es6 edge+ and then plot in the
galaxy note 5 so this is crazy I want to
hear your opinions on this but I
actually legitimately had a hard time
remembering what we saw today not
because it's boring not because the
phones are bad or anything but because
I'm previously a note event was like a
note event like four weeks you're like
home what's the next note kind of a
smelly them right and we all feel like
it was a daydream yeah
a little dazed right more excited about
the tootsie rolls now we have to preface
that you are a victim of red-eye flight
scheduling and fuzzy brain donor area
I'm working on e two hours of sleep ok
so we are not in Josh's drunk buzz is
the word okay sorry two scotches right
no but but I think even if we were all
on eight hours of sleep and stone sober
we would be probably feeling the same
way about this this kind of thing why
don't you Erica give us a rundown on
what the galaxy s6 plus Way galaxy s6
edge+ the galaxy s6 edge big yeah yeah
um the edge um it's just big um that's
all I can say it's like if somebody
stuck a straw in a galaxy s6 yes they
blew it up yeah you get a nice little
people edge feature and you have apps
inside that these people edge feature I
think that's it I mean yeah so you can
swipe in from the side and launch apps
and then in the in the edge thing
feature that should have been there in
the first place right yeah so the
battery is bigger because the phone is
bigger it's what it is a 5.7 inch
display now yes still prodigy Super
AMOLED you've got a three thousand
million power battery for 20 well XE
knows the exynos 7420 it's the same old
16 megapixel camera we don't know which
sensor they're using Isis 00 the same
sure I ask this sec well you know we'll
see yeah I guess they'll just see which
ones they use it first then whatever's
left over essentially what you checked
it from the s6 yeah however they're
gonna happen it's the same phone man
yeah I mean there's other stuff though
right maybe we've got I mean the display
like I said it displays up in 5.7 just
for gigs of RAM now yeah compared to
three yes so that is that is a biggie LT
category 9 support which i don't know if
that was there before if they were just
making a big deal out of it today
sure so basically with that one extra
gigabyte of RAM if there was issue with
ram management hopefully our apps won't
be shutting down hopefully that's that's
good it's hopefully operative word it
shouldn't image they should have been
shining out on three gigs let me say
that yes diksha not have been turning
off s health while I was trying to
manage my workout just because it was in
the background by one card yeah so when
they around this since age I was like
okay let's make sure those the software
can handle it fine and then there's a
samsung pay they made a big deal about
that that's launching August twentieth
and Europe and September 28th in the
United States so they'll be fun to try
josh is the one who first told me about
that on a previous edition of this
podcast talk about what was at mwc I
told me about the the pay thing oh well
it to be honest like it was just
personally I'm not really that convinced
about any pay services because I don't
want all of my credit cards to an all my
information for that matter to be out in
what could potentially be the cloud the
event if tokenization is something that
Samsung is trying to do with Samsung pay
for this that launched at the same time
you know it's just if anybody could come
in and just swipe up from the bottom
which is what you're able to do with
Samsung pay you just swipe up from the
bottom at any point on the phone then
your credit cards come on can you select
which one yes you can put in a pan or a
finger in action yeah that too but still
it's just you know I it to me it seems a
little bit too accessible for anybody
else I want my wallet sitting in my
pocket I want my cards to stay in there
and I want them to come out only 1i is
this your old person threshold it might
be really something you're just gonna be
like no no this bar no further i'm not
doing i won't try it for sure but it
went when the chips in my high end
credit cards don't even work in half of
the places i go to to to pay for stuff i
don't imagine this will be very
ubiquitous trade like for a long time
well if the magnetic stripe emulator
thing works well then you know very oh
yeah fair enough i right yeahhh mister
what about Erica how do you feel about
this said the Samsung pay potential I
haven't had a chance to you can try out
the Apple pay try to went to Whole Foods
and it said oh you have to you know
updater install the app and that was as
far as I got so that's going to be the
mortality right there like the
moment people say to see that they're
gonna be like I'll just take my card out
and go yeah so i oh was i was in the
same boat and then the other day I left
the house without my wallet okay and I
spent the entire day on the town without
my wallet how'd you get here uh we
rented here X it hahaha but no I got
around town because my public transit
passes on my ring and I had my hellos
and I had my keys and I was like
whatever and then like two hours later
I'm hungry I'm like I gotta get some
lunch Oh cancel that order i just made
her done on my wall but if I'd had
mobile payments set up on my phone I
would have been fine and that made like
that sort of turned the tide for me a
little bit I understand that's a rare
circumstance and a lot of people leave
it or well so no but it's like oh well
this is an option I could have had yeah
if I was living in the future like I'm
supposed to be but without your wall you
didn't have your ID either yeah that's
true can really put your ID on your
phone I mean you could scan it I guess
we that should be the next thing there
you go be the next big thing I hope so
but then the other phone yeah but then
it comes down to what at my phone's dead
when I need it right well then you need
a yotaphone and the idea is on the back
when at all time there you go yeah
samsung also made a big deal about their
battery leadership today sweeping out of
the rug notice they have so much to say
about how they charge their batteries
but they never talked about we have the
biggest battery and yeah that was never
the case so can we hit the bad stuff
first and then end on no there's get the
negative nancies another way yes what's
the capacity on that on the new
batteries and so less than this less
than the galaxy s6 active josh is
holding them now which is 3,500 3,500
3000 Willie empowers wreath enjoy it
smiles up yeah but that's down from 30
to 20 on last year's no night and then
3200 or whatever on the note before that
or whatever it was in 31 so they've
brought it down below all of the notes
in perforations and put in a display
that is as high resolution or higher
than any note before which a display
that I think is responsible for the poor
battery performance of the standard s6
although I haven't taken your
temperature on this Erica what's your
what
what kind of better left you get on your
sx this thing don't ask Apple it go boom
and we get 5 i'm very very fast yeah I
give people to hit me on Twitter all the
time being like I'm I get six hours
screen on time for my galaxy s6 edge of
my where's what now there's anybody get
six hours on any phone i don't know i
don't yet know on the one plus the first
one I did get six hours though I was
harassed with the battery life different
really no okay well the mingoes is
special I did I did analyze this with a
couple of our buddies at the event today
and they did tell me that you know if
you live I live on the side of a
mountain it's constantly looking for
southern now I can kind of see that
music yeah absolutely but even then I'm
trying to take steps I'm trying to lower
the screen brightness like constantly
which makes my eyes hurt turn off the
gps at all times by the location assess
the most i've ever gone is four and a
half hours on this one plus two that's
the most screen on time you've ever
gotten that you forgot yeah okay it
lasted more than a day because i don't
look at my phone for more than you know
right how much I need I'm a normal
person but but for a half hours is the
most i've ever gone a vessel to you you
know I there's so many variables it's
really hard to pin it down I'm trying
right now I'm spending a week without
the facebook app installed which I
always had or its associated apps like
messenger and like that right now it
hasn't given me the awesome battery life
that I was half expecting but whatever
but anyway I think I mean we're
concerned about this 3011 per battery
pack but there's still the adaptive fast
charging and now my favorite thing which
erica doesn't care about exactly and I
don't know how Josh field about it is
the the wireless charging with the
ambass wireless fast fast proprietary
world astringent so is it proprietary
well those are all very different those
are all very specific looking charges
they had at the at the well they just
play a regular puck I don't know well I
landed but I excuse to guess I'm saying
yeah I'm really hoping that fast
charging is not proprietary because if
it's not and that's nice but there are
so many
chargers on the market that how do they
ubiquitous if you will that standard
that being said two hours of fast
wireless charging means that you need to
have your phone on there for two hours
and that's just not gonna mess you're in
a quarter no three thousand million
power battery yeah exactly i would
rather plug that thing in on a even a
moto quick charger have like half
battery life in half an hour be done
sure you know that's that's what i would
rather you know take a shower plug that
thing and take a shower you're done
right yeah and i get it i think it needs
to be faster and i think they are
leading the charge on this they did
deserve the credit for them because it
start somewhere right okay it's faster
wireless charging that we have currently
they're saying as thirty percent fest or
we'll see exactly how much faster it is
once we get to get to spend some
extended time with these things but
that's included it's still PMA and she
which is nice what else are we looking
at what else we're forgetting your
TouchWiz they did they've got some kind
of youtube based periscope competitor
that i'm not really sure is it's not the
same some of our YouTube move do you
think I reeks of a samsung yes I was on
because on the one hand you have like
YouTube gaming coming out trying to hit
a twitch right yeah but this doesn't
feel like a move that YouTube would be
you know it doesn't need sams exactly it
was like a samsung move for sure yeah
just like seeing looking at the the the
landscape and saying not necessarily
saying what I think is the more useful
thing which is what can we improve on
but instead like what can we do placate
me copy which is the weird front though
we don't have to talk about the
implications now but for samsung to say
let's make a periscope yeah it makes
sense where YouTube to say that but
doesn't really make sense for Samson
right yeah yeah I thought was
interesting and I sort of expected them
to go into more detail on it but they
spent maybe a minute on and on stage and
then they sort of moved out it was look
it's my event that's it yeah and you
know what those videos that they were
showing during that presentation 64
million views on that on that video
about what was in Times Square they're
not gonna happen hey I'm really supposed
to show you how Samsung doesn't really
understand you too I will say maybe the
universe my i would i would like for a
year a year from now for us to
go back and listen to us me like mom man
that thing totally took over what's it
called I forgot I didn't live broadcast
like palace called yeah oh you have to
rename that if any way yeah I think
pretty much is it's the video mode but
the video button now says live on it
yeah and it just and it just immediately
broadcast or whatever and you kill was
your date okay I set up yeah that's okay
though Souter's periscope right a man
and I think periscope needs needs some
competition there so maybe that'll be
cool we should talk about the the other
phone on the roster the one that was
supposed to be isn't this so sad that
you're doling it deals or the other
phone yeah writing that note 5 thing
yeah we all knew too much about you yeah
the links were spot on right yes I feel
like I played with it already such a
depressing part of our ladder right now
yeah you know exactly right not weren't
the three of us will all of us in the
industry we're not allowed to be
surprised anymore yeah and that's that's
really sucky but that does mean that
when a company doesn't manage to drop
the bomb and do it right then it's
really worth it it's really something
special yeah that's good but the note 5
is what best described I don't how would
you how would you describe it to UM the
s6 big with a little friend erica in
essex with a pen yeah pretty much yeah
s6 edge+ with a pen it is essential
question I mentioned this in the birds
on the back yes exactly and then it was
as if they took a spatula turn it over
and say hey s6 edge plus i mentioned
this in my in my vs video between the
no.5 about 4 and what kind of perplex me
about this new note device is that in
the history of samsung the note device
tend to take what the galaxy s device of
the same year kind of failed at doing
last year was the s5s band-aid design
here before that and was the poultry
battery and the the fact that the s4
which is kind of like yeah whatever you
know um and a note 3 was amazing the
note 4 was amazing at three hundred
seventy dollars for a lot of sales at
the after the note for right now grab
them right now
but the thing is another five for the
first time ever it followed the lead of
the galaxy s device it i will say this i
was thinking about this on my long train
ride today I agree with you up to a
point but I don't think for the first
time ever I think the first note
followed the style guide of the galaxy s
and then they get the note 2 was
essentially just an inflated s3 okay
with a lot about it features but but
fair enough yeah fair enough I did not
start in this industry until the note 3
yeah but nobody i was thinking exactly
the same thing and i remember being so
taken with the note 3 and 4 in part
because exactly they got right what the
s the galaxy s had failed to doing that
being said this year I you I would make
the argument that the galaxy s6 didn't
need a whole lot of fixing on the
physical side of things I think it's
gorgeous I love it I think it feels
great in the hand you carry that's yours
is it yeah i mean god it's beautiful
every i compared over the one close to
you the other day and I was like it's
it's it's amazing it oozes quality for I
got the deepest scratch I've ever gotten
on a smartphone except for them don't
know how yeah if you happen to shoot it
with it with a projectile weapons uh-huh
it's not gonna be a great fight yeah I
didn't do anything but I promise yeah
but I mean so they could have chosen a
worse starting point versus my is my is
my devil's advocate position but even
the presentation itself glossed over all
of the specifications that were already
here from the s6 necessaries when the
presentation was so short yeah because
they can just duplicate the presentation
you already know write books okay yeah
here's what's new same what is it what
is it same 5.7 inch butter to sue
Bramblett same for gigs of LP ddr4 ram
same LT category 9 Sam sounds dope a 16
megapixel camera with new video
stabilization three thousand million
power battery thirty percent faster
wireless charging what am I missing the
new that new video stabilization I had
thought that they were using
the digital image stabilization and the
OAS at the same time were they not or
did they now combine it in a way that
marries well that seemed that latter
point seemed to be what they were trying
to say right they've enhanced the
software side of it so that it works in
concert with the optical stabilization
better okay well I'm excited to try that
because everyone who is rubbish at this
point yes real time warp stabilization
basically so well if you hold if you do
way if you do say for example the
oneplus 2 and the s6 side-by-side and
sort of spin them around and walk around
a bit you can see the s6 doing its job
yeah but better so i mean i don't know
i'm i'm fairly impressed by it at this
one but in any case what about the s-pen
it is the one thing now that makes a
note a note and I liked I liked one new
feature in particular kyllikki tom is
very good that is normally what I would
have said but no not that the Wow no I
like the clicky job so that listeners
have you don't know the thing you can do
with the new S Pen is you you push it
you push it in a little bit I don't know
how to say this without getting weird
but you are here yeah you you know you
press it and it mechanically pops out
like a what is what is that like like a
ballpoint pen yeah yeah but a clicky
something yeah so a little bit of gift
comes out and that's what you pull it
out and then when you do that what
happens is if the screen is off formerly
with the current note you pull the s-pen
out the screen comes alive and it does
whatever you tell it to do like Action
Center will pop whatever with this one
like you pop the s-pen out and you can
immediately write in the screen it's
brilliant it's great it's really really
good it is so smart it is if you pop it
in it saves automatically you don't have
to hit the Save button right so you pop
out the s-pen make your note pop the S
Pen back in the phone shuts off and
saves whatever you we didn't even hit
the home button at that point it still
saves it in any case it saves it ah I
just think that okay as awesome as it is
dry school as that future is it kind of
predicates on the idea that the person
would already use the S Pen in general I
think about the user who never
yes ma'am I get the note you can get the
s6 edge plus or plus whatever maybe this
is a good question now is that question
going to be asked this year because
previous years it's like I'm never gonna
use the S Pen should I get the note yeah
do value a big battery and a better
build and whole bunch of stuff like then
yeah get the note but this year it's
like oh it's the same thing except it
has an S Pen so is that is that the lone
differentiator now looks like it are
they trying to pigeonhole people to get
this line now or what is yeah because
that's really it well they're really
just trying to shine a spotlight on the
only features that make these two things
unique cuz otherwise you have you can't
have a note 5 without the pen no you
can't you know so really what can you do
you make crimped edges that's it right
why not why not continue its legacy of
the of this sort of power users refuge
and keep them my crusty in the removable
battery Erica and I were talking about
the removal better in the walk up here
like how useful it could be yeah in my
case but you'd found yourself never
using it right yes I complain but I
really don't have anything complain
about because I don't use the features
anyway never exchanged the battery don't
ever use an SD card but I'm angry I'm
still angry fix for I did the same way
to i don't use a replaceable batteries
as much as I ever did like the only time
I ever did was with a Galaxy Nexus but
that's because that thing lasted for
like 40 minutes and that was it yeah it
sure did right and but expandable
storage is not something that I harp on
until they run out of storage and to be
fair with even 32 gigabytes I'm pretty
good at keeping things pretty smart yeah
I'm not gonna lie okay so okay yeah but
you're not the type who shoots 4k video
a lot because I have a camera for that
right these are being pitched right is
4k cameras and somebody behind me i
think sarah maybe it was flo who's
sitting next to me said like what are
you going to do to do what are you gonna
get a 32 gig phone or a 64 gig photo
shoot a lot of 4k video and then what
just upload it to the cloud every night
yeah i guess you could do that you're
going to run out of local storage space
really quickly well someone on our
youtube channel did say like it is
everyone forgetting about OTG and like
yes everyone's forget yes everyone's
refresh dress that's the USB dongle you
plug in
the USB port so you need to have you
have a two way connector one goes into
the phone the other side as a regular
USB connection you put a flash drive in
there and just transfer stuff out as you
need to right it's not only cumbersome
it's an extra piece of kit you need to
have with you yeah so you guys lose
those things it's not connected to the
thing I forget it it's gonna get lucky
dad if your phone doesn't have a table
the notion just struck me that we're
talking about videos we've uploaded
erica is going to upload some videos
later on I soon yeah in any case and I
we're talking about these people in the
abstract but why don't we see what they
say normally this is a live show folks
we're not doing a live show this is just
this is pre-recorded but so we don't
have the Q&amp;amp;A but let's look at the
comments on my one of these I don't know
it was one of the hands on its does it
really matter then notifies lucido 5
let's see Apple pay Samsung paying that
it won't be available in the Netherlands
only edge 6 plus this is the note 5
which is a peculiar move to keep it out
of Europe you have so much bezels why in
the world can't you just throw in a set
of front facing speakers yeah the
speaker has been moved to what to the
lower bottom just like it looks just
like any iPhone gives you a happy I kind
of positioning the iphone standard
position Melvin born toe and
expectations always hurts as Shakespeare
said smiley face now when we gonna talk
about your Shakespeare brother but uh
what you're saying is no memory card
removable battery no kid and actress
don't kid a few directory as text as
they really should make the note 6 a
power user phone again same point I
think a lot of us are making so they
would have a good looking s7 edge plus
for those who want looks and a
powerhouse with big removable battery
and microSD slot for those who love to
note for I asked Erik on the way down
here do you think Samsung is prepping
such a device or have they given up on
this segment entirely it's really hard
to say I hope that they are hope they
have something up their sleeve and
they're just
Shh kind of pushing the note out of the
rug and just like guys with Nintendo
what they're doing they're going to have
what what is this new Nintendo thing
they're releasing maybe they'll have a
no and new I don't know power user or
something yeah she's right it's hard to
say but the reason why also is because I
understand is naive yeah I've said it a
few times but that's just how the
consumer will perceive this changes oh
the Essex came out they kind of liked
what they did so they just kind of made
it the note 5 this time around you know
but I know it's naive to say that
because honestly these design choices
and all these choices that I made of
both devices were made probably like one
and a half years ago and then you they
were going to make this at this point so
we don't know what they're going to have
in store for the seven six or seven
rather than six best second I do tend to
question that a little bit though I mean
that's always what the manufacturer
comes back and says right when LG this
is a plan for a while so yeah blame us
right LG was like will use the
snapdragon 808 cuz we'd always planned
to for they'd for the g4 this was
planned years in a fencin yeah this is
very likely trim put in my conspiracy
hat on but look at the s6 and then look
at the look at the essex edge and look
at the s6 edge+ and tell me that a
company with the resources of Samsung
can't sit back for a second look at I
don't know the iphone plus or something
and say oh man that seems like a good
idea you're right lets you know tool up
those production lines real quick can
you just build that factory real quick
what's it going to take two weeks okay
build it and then make this thing like
you know coax it into existence I think
they can do whatever they want now
that's info have looks good thanks I
appreciate it well what do we miss I
feel like there's been there's been a
little bit of it's been a funny kind of
show I mean they're these are great
these are great looking devices we don't
know price yeah right we know release
date yeah yeah we order crazy today
pre-orders today it's after 3pm here
don't forget the pre-order exactly can I
tell you guys that I'm actually more
excited if right all right now I've been
talking so much what would you pick
Erica if you had to choose one of these
you have to choose one no no the note
because well I hope I don't fry myself
here but I don't really care for the
edge because of the glare that I would
see on the edge and I don't like the bit
of color shifting on the sides and I
just I liked the flat miss of the the
note 5 and that's why I went with the
galaxy s6 instead of the edge i have
both but I can't bring myself to use the
edge also because it's uncomfortable in
my little hands and it's too edgy for I
like flattens just because where's the
pledge is because but but you don't
never with you that s pen is not playing
any role in the decision for you not
really you just said you like the screen
off member though I do am I gonna
remember to use it maybe maybe let me
jot down your number and then half an
hour later why didn't I type this I
can't even recognize my own handwriting
it's all about that keyboard I know oh
god horn accessory oh my god talk about
that yes so listeners have you missed
this it's um samsung appears to have
taken a mold of a palm treo keyboard
from 2007 and made a case out of it it's
pretty bad it looks okay did you guys
get hands-on time with it yes okay I
didn't want to touch it it doesn't look
like something you want actually um we
tell us how it felt it's strangely
clicky it's almost satisfying but not
quite so it's click there so there's
mechanical feedback on the button is
there so it's not just little nubs on
the back of those buttons that are
giving the on-screen keyboard when you
shake when you take it off and you look
at the back of it there's nothing I was
like oh nothing oh so how does the ways
of bluetooth no now Lou tooth they say
that there's a sensor and somehow it
knows by touching I guess there must be
something underneath
the membrane that's touching and it
knows very sensitively what it is it's
touching it I wanted to know more but
they couldn't explain how it actually
functioned do you expect them to yeah I
said people behind the tables no no yes
right right there is this there is a
sensor inside of it and so I thought it
was interesting how much is that thing
no age 9 95 Wow I'm trying to look up
the price what you are you serious oh
right well say sorry I'm trying to look
up the price on on the pre-order site
but it's it's throwing an error when I
do so they have a final esxi josh same
question to you oh yeah yeah at a node 5
or s6 edge+ 105 yeah the note 5 solely
because okay so actually you know what
let me change my answer I don't want the
note 5 active that's what I want the
note 5 active ok lamin out there's got
to be some sort of variation to these
two phones if they're this similar to
what we had before mm-hmm and like I say
we there has to be not because I think
they're actually gonna do it because I
want it yeah I don't want an active
version i want an active version that
has i go like like a thick pin is just
going to say we talked about the way
we've talked about this for three
generations now there's always been this
rumor that probably some Joker in the
corner somewheres thinking up and thrown
out there's like there's going to be a
node active this year and i've always
had the part of me that's like you like
oh that's exciting sounding and then the
other part of me going like why would I
ever do why do they ever do that why
would they take this like making a
luxury pickup truck all right yeah why
would they take this thick phone and
make it like five point seven inches but
you know to be fair if there's thirty
eight hundred million powers in that
battery then I'll picking it up right
away but if I had to begin between the
two then yes the note 5 yeah the note 5
because I would actually use the S Pen
actually enjoy using the s-pen when the
no more I used it as a pointer usually
as a mouse yeah this is a trait i love
it was great in the note 5 I it has okay
if this is always the case when we first
get or
hands on the phone the note 5 actually
made the note for field cheap and I hate
to say that because a note for it
actually is one of my favorite phones of
all time but the reason why is because
it felt heavier the glass the metal
right ah but you know once once once I
got out of that that ain't media
pre-show sort of like I you know this
new device I'm gonna love it no matter
what I thought to myself man enough for
such a good deal right now yeah I bet
they're gonna sell it I bet there's
gonna be a spike in those sales or at
least moment very calming of the
reduction as people like flock to the
last the last power users fast and even
then the s6 edge I used for quite a
while mostly because I was the version I
was given so I was using it for a while
I love the camera everything was really
great about it I thought that the phone
was really stellar Lee put together but
that thing after a week after it was
gunked up with my personal Boyles that's
what is it that's for me the titles in
show what i would find personal oil
after after the slipperiness kind of
became a factor I was always afraid to
go drop that phone oh yeah oh yeah and
there's a lot of it I held the s6 edge+
today the s6 edge big is I'm gonna keep
going yeah and I thought to myself it
feels good now but two weeks from now
not yeah I've never dropped it thank God
you know actually know what I dropped at
one time but it was like like a very
tiny drop i really think i won't i
really think i'm gonna drop it eric has
got a bumper case on hers yeah I had the
active so I'm just like it well one time
I actually like said this is my beer and
put my phone in yeah yeah yeah somebody
has to see my active once and I was like
I'll let me just clean it off for it I'm
put it in the restaurant water oh hey
wait why my place while reporting beer
with a phone in it I got tequila with
the worm in it yeah for the beer with
all your personal skin oily you know I
think I would kiid I've been I've been a
note fan for a bit but i think i would
take the s6 edge do you know why it's
the worst reason ever why different yes
to be a contrarian okay but no more
importantly the silver titanium shade
that the new s6 edge+ comes in I'd
seriously we used it for the develop
comes in in two
okay doesn't look as good okay it's so
gorgeous I mean that and they've managed
I will say this they've managed to make
a phone that's huge not feel so huge in
the hand fair and when you couple it
with that silver color that they haven't
really used on any of their phones since
they were making them plastic and
covering them in like nail polish nail
gloss really um it's it's gorgeous it's
a beautiful phone so I would take it
just for the vanity so you will for the
vanity yeah okay so i would flash it
around and Austin I was gonna say do you
like seeing yourself in your phone yeah
I do it's very important I need matted I
like you know I like Matt cover set just
I we don't have that choice yeah yeah
you're right i use it all so all right
what's our final thoughts on I eric has
to go and are you just never gonna
return out I don't know I like the new
note sure yes pretty the back is nice
once I get a chance to play with it
we'll see because I was not so convinced
really at first with the note 66 m 6x
well you haven't really unit but I ended
up really liking the s6 seriously yeah
that's that's all i can say i don't want
to judge it too much i don't want to be
too negative do you think they're gonna
sell a lot well they're not selling this
too well with the s6 it's true the edge
kind of throws a curve so to speak and
in the whole ecosystem for them yeah i
mean but i don't know what the sales
numbers are like I know they're not
meeting expectations but they're still
selling to be clear they're still
selling in Essex is no selling but steep
edge that is breaking expectations is it
the edge is the one that everyone is
demanding which means that when you take
the s6 in a vacuum it's not selling as
well as they wanted hmm but the edge
yeah I just was making it up given that
I think the edge the edge is very smart
and I think people might receive the s6
edge+ better than the note 5 honestly
that might be so and I think you might
be right just in terms of branding I
think people have been conditioned now
to expect the plus the plus gentleman is
like oh it's like I was like the iphone
thought oh I can look at this and then
when you pick it up I will say when you
pick it up it's impressive I don't know
if you guys agree or not I I thought at
first feel yet I'm telling you a month
from now yeah gummy oils not what about
personal personal oil what am I here or
they did Josh what do you think um you
think they got to move a lot about it
well I'm sure they will it's just the
way that is gonna work which one is
anything i move more up dead only or the
edge yeah i did think of them award the
edge because it's something that's
different the note 5 that they can
market the s-pen all that they want but
the typical user was walking around New
York City right below us right now just
walk around never use the pen yeah do
you think the note is played out no I
hope not but it looks like they wanted
to at this point yeah it's true doesn't
good way to put it no would you feel the
same way if they didn't release the s6
plus edge yes the other one alongside
like what if the note was released in a
vacuum I mean would it be wait would it
be cooler I would feel that way if we
did it ok let's right this way if it was
just the s6 and then the no.5 if we had
no edges at all all right then I would
be excited about the moon life it's
because we've already had the edge we've
already had it yeah we know what it's
about now it's bigger I just think that
I think it's cuz the note has lost its
identity a bit like what we were talking
about before yeah well they did just
massacre it so it's like they had to
have something that took two steps above
like the s6 edge+ and then the note took
a couple steps down they kind of pushed
it under the rug said by the way here's
a bigger thing because
to life so here you go yes can we go
back to the galaxy s line being
disappointing can we go back to that
world Yeah Yeah right that was that was
easier to understand yeah now i think it
was interesting i think the samsung that
we saw two there that i saw today
reflects a samsung that is agile and
actually learning and adapting because
just in terms of their presentation you
know there were some cheesy moment to
others and dumb jokes but their
presentations are they have honed their
message for the audience that they know
us out there i don't think anyone was
walking away from this event today going
well that's soaked because it didn't it
was well presented there were tons of
phones for everybody and everybody was
reasonably well-informed everybody knew
what they were going to demo like it was
it was well run or not tap dancing kids
running like that right but it does but
it says a lot but it says a lot that the
that the presentation itself didn't want
to repeat anything that was good about
the phone that was from the s6 already
right I just told you what was new and
that was it yeah it says a lot yeah
there was a discernible lack of bombast
yeah Erica's gotta go Erica say goodbye
to everybody hugs Erica this was awesome
this is gonna be great radio you're
gonna listen to hugs goodbye see Nick
more touchy roles yeah really okay i
guess a play safe trip we'll see you at
the next one oh yes that was erica
griffin technology nerd who likes to
film stuff is that the first time you
had on the show I know she has been on
the show before but we had massive
technical difficulties huh so we didn't
have hopefully we didn't have those the
counter still running the clock is still
right oh and the clock is still running
on our breather room extend a zero hours
2 minutes remaining I will extend
because I don't hate me my my outro is
longer than two minutes little 5 p.m.
what time is my train anyway Josh yes
we've talked to the Samsung stuff a bed
listeners that mean you may have felt
maybe that was a little bit on the heavy
on the negative side I think we struck a
kind of an
okay okay balance but I don't know I
want to make I think that I think
they're good phones I just don't think
I'm just not blown away the way I
usually am from a note that is it says
essentially the tone that we're all
gonna have that's what i was thinking
you know cuz that very sentence that I
said the beginning of the cast was the
note line for the first time at least
for me the for the first time took the
lead of the galaxy s and with that comes
a lot of pros and cons maybe a couple
more cons than pros and really that's
the tone that I think a lot of our
coverage is going to end up being like
and I think a lot of the comment
commentary from from readers and viewers
is going to be the same and you can loss
over all of the like the super vulgar
ones yeah we have plenty of radio
there's more guests Samsung does want us
to be wall huggers small useless battery
no expandable storage blah blah blah
blah no room we'll battery nor
expandable memory that kills the note 5
for me I am sad and angry these are all
comments listeners from from the YouTube
from the hands-on it's a shame you know
even even the note loyalists or actually
upset and that says a lot honestly it
has a lot about this phone yeah well um
we're gonna we're going to be talking
about a lot more so no sense dwelling on
it now there's another phone we have on
our table and what I hinted at in the
intro for the for the last little bit of
this short podcast is is a device that
does what i discovered the other day
does a lot of the stuff the samsung
galaxy s6 does just you know not as well
but three hundred dollars not as well i
don't think so yes we have the 1+2 here
i have one josh has one we are phone
twins for once never carry the same for
their yeah that's true but we will you
mr. captain two phones with your second
phone that's it my bag along with the
fifth and 18th phones I want to do
what's your second aside from the 1+2 uh
there I am what am i doing oh no you
know I don't have one I'm cheating yeah
this is a dual-sim phone my juice isn't
fair enough
ah so that's been handy I'm not going to
come back to this later if I don't say
it now so i will say that yeah this is
my first time carrying and using a dual
sim phone with really sims okay so I've
a review dual sim phone before I just
haven't used both Simpson okay this is
the first time I've been like okay
t-mobile in one slot AT&amp;amp;T and the other
this phone is set up to do it so let's
see how it does it and it saved my butt
today how's that because I was in the
venue that for the samsung event at
Lincoln Center Liga center and they had
no freaking reception on t-mobile and I
was like well I need some data I let me
just go into the menu and swap over to
sim 2 oh look at that i have data the
question yeah okay you have tmobile and
ATT yeah does it say that they're both
eighteen t yup reports it does not
report the the carrier strain accurately
exactly and how long does it take for
you to swap data from one to the other
the first time I tried it it really did
a reboot I couldn't it wouldn't do
exactly me too but then ever since it's
been fine it takes maybe 30 seconds to
do to execute as well I guess I'm
impatient because I feel like it doesn't
take 30 seconds for me and I'm what I
said in my in my video showcasing the
new features of the phone was if you're
going to swap the sim data because the
calls and texts seem to be like that
really quick yeah we listeners you can
select where you want each which does it
what do you want the simpson a call it's
a three-day times if you want to change
which card is handling data I would say
just switch it and then we started fun
just to save some time yes that's what I
was obviously that's funny because no I
for me it's it's quicker than a restart
now i can swap between the two and and
watch it work for a little bit and then
okay now i'm on the other network so
that was very handy for me I did do some
research and find that some commenters
asked they were like oh does the dual
sim eat more battery I'm like initially
I'm like now look what dumb question I
didn't say it in my head I was like now
of course it doesn't that's foolish I
have no idea where I got that opinion
from because with very very cursory
research i found out that yes indeed
dhulian phones do incur cuz as to
keeping a signal tone sure but i was
thinking like both there just to
subscriber modules it's not like you're
adding another
Radio to the phone right now but if
you're using it with two different
networks apparently and this has been
proven time and time again that yeah
there's certainly if you have like let's
say text and data on one and it calls on
the other certainly that's going to make
it yes I can see that but for me like I
only did it to switch between the two
because I've I'm kind of over on my ATT
so I move over to t-mobile sure so when
I get the notification that said you've
used ninety percent of a teensy I'm like
okay switcheroo um but yeah if you're
only on one card at all times I suppose
it's kind of a minuscule change but when
you're using both the same time for sure
yeah so let's talk about it like other
things on this phone how's your
fingerprint scanner been on the 1+2 i
chalk it up to the fact that i don't
know how to press this thing properly
tell me yeah tell me you're the only
other person who's had this time there's
two two factors number one I don't think
I press it right because I'm treating it
like a HTC capacitive key or it's like
Oh a very tiny impressive the very tip
of my finger will be able to trigger it
never the case I have to push down cover
the whole thing like I'm suffocating the
thing in order to make it read my
fingerprint so like touch ID yeah
basically um but on the other hand I I
don't know maybe it's just I have tried
thumbs it does it miss Reed does it
prompt you to scan again um okay i want
to say yes because i've had instances
where i have to press two or three times
right reposition my finger to finally
get it right but even just as a home
button I feel like I'm not hitting it as
well as it should be so sometimes you
press it and it doesn't send you nothing
it doesn't do any nothing yeah do you
sometimes press it and it vibrates to
register touch but still does nothing no
I ok mine does that yeah so yeah it's
intermittent I think that they're still
working on some stuff I want to say
which something I said six times in my
last one plus two video this is
pre-release software yeah so we're due
for at least one more update before the
release yeah I don't know if it's gonna
come early enough yeah you know what I
mean like cuz i know i was just
something I heard I think manual
controls in the camera supposed to be a
thing yes yeah I heard that too yeah
yeah I want to wait for that but who
knows one's gonna come in right I'm just
like that fixed to happen but those you
know those little bugs aside with that
button this has been this is performed
really well yeah I agree and I'm not
really surprised I guess I was
conditioned to be surprised were you
surprised Josh that a data phone powered
by the world's most hated process
performed by arguably the most hated
company yeah honestly no I'm not very
surprised because the reason why is that
the one plus one has continued the one
I'm saying the one yeah has continued to
prove reliable I've given it to multiple
people to borrow up until the two came
out and I needed to take it back into
comparisons um and they have all said
that their performance has been quite
good like for example my girlfriend she
she used to one plus one for a while
with my my bamboo backing and she
thought it's a very very reliable decent
phone on the daily and then when I had
to take it back i gave her the alcatel
one touch idol 3 which comes in at a
very similar price point yeah and she's
like i missed the one by this one so
much really she really misses it so I
thought to myself you know as someone
who's into in the actual industry is
hard for us to really pinpoint those
experiences for ourselves because we're
bringing on the one hand were very
critical blonde the other hand were very
tolerant because we understand sure you
know what I mean absolutely so knowing
the 1+1 performed amicably and the fact
that has a 299 price points like I give
them a lot of props for that so when the
1+2 came by and proved to be just as
reliable as I can of course that's what
these guys do yeah despite oxygen OS
being what it is you know like I wish
there was more to it I wish was more
talks intro oxygen OS than feeling like
a Google now launcher it is very basic
from what I understand I didn't do the 1
plus 1 i've never i've held it my friend
has one and when he reviewed it for us
so you were not spoiled by cyanogen 12
no I understand centered in 12 let you
do all kinds of customizations of stuff
an oxygen OS is very much more
consumer-oriented the exactly so I don't
problem about you know why so my god
this is great this is like stock Android
it lets me customize the accent color
which I did too and the dark theme in
the app permissions it's like an M
preview I mean it feels I feel ahead of
the curve
oxygen OS whereas I feel a lot of people
who use the one plus one with CM the
cyanogenmod field like oxygen OS is a
step backwards it's a for lack of a
better term like a dumber OS ya allah to
vanilla yeah which to me is like if one
plus is trying not to be vanilla then
they didn't really succeed with oxygen
that's what I was just thinking
obviously with with the phone I feel
like yeah with the hardware it's great
it's I like it um I don't think that
cameras very attractive I think that
that design could have been tweaked a
little bit but did you notice them how
you you're not covering it anymore ah i
did not i mean so be that earlier i
guess in the 1+1 the camera was located
very closely so I oh yes so whenever you
would hold it your finger would get in
front of the lens is that what the deal
was exactly i see so now it's like you
can actually hold it kind of like a
camera like yeah and possession oh well
I'm position it a little bit better you
know yeah but that being said the camera
and so like a hawk got the camera all
right tell me you're a camera
experiences with the 1+2 quality not
actually as bad as I thought it would be
really call it quality was ok well
low-light could use a lot of work there
are very specific reasons for that oh I
asked can only go so far yeah if the
shutter speed is over 1 over 30 mm-hmm
for all the pictures I took in low light
okay I commend you for going for low ISO
to keep the noise low but if it's one
over tenth of a second do any little
movement that the Oasis is screwed right
yeah it's not a magic like exactly
rubber band rig and that also said the
app itself does have some trouble with
speed it's just a reskinned a google
camera app isn't that it feels like it
yeah yeah yeah and you know especially
when you have the slower shutter speed
already adding to your time from shutter
to file right shutter two files already
not that great in the beginning it felt
pretty good yeah but over time it felt
so much slower today I try to take a
picture I try to take that I took I try
to take a picture of my glasses imagine
it took it took so long yeah and to the
groaning of everyone add my
table like yeah real that's our
experience too ah yeah I reiterate that
i wish i was at that table that sounds
like a fun just really too bad you're
leaving tonight I know oh yeah you have
an important disco tomorrow um what I'm
still thinking about about the various
things that I have covered it well you
said that you loved the alert slider
which I'm cut yeah it's great you think
so so there's an alert side of listeners
if you're not familiar with the one plus
two on the side of the phone that lets
you switch the ringer on and off
basically but it also has a middle
position for the third Android priority
notifications level I think it's great I
think I loved it on the palm devices i
loved it on the iphone i love it on this
I being able to just reach in your
pocket and if you're not wearing your
Android wear device thanks for calling
me out like that do you have a smart I
have my pebble time on you didn't
actually know if we had more time we
should have like made up the fact that
okay listeners we were supposed to do
the work with you again I'm co review
but we have get them at the same time we
did it no I think that's like but anyway
um I'm pebble time and if I have my
phone on complete no interruptions
everything comes to my watch I don't
need to worry about I just leave it at
the no interruptions Irish sure um but I
really have a moto 360 and if I don't
remember to put it in theater mode and
I'm at an event like we were at today in
a dark room and I get a notification
like I'm gonna blind the person to my
good but they're not know I will admit
though like if I didn't have my pebble
time and again android where does tap
into the interruptions like ecosys
Aikman yeah it's just a way of doing in
platform yeah so I agree with that you
know my fellow time is a kind of a
specific type of situation sure but that
being said yes once in your pocket you
can feel the texture of the slider and
then this we just move it over I agree I
don't know if you notice but the two
phones i have on the table right now 1
plus 2 and Galaxy s6 active they're the
two phones that are the only phones and
Android that have extra inputs we have
the alert slider in the act of
it's not the only phones on andhra that
I've actually no true but there's a the
main ones get your right there either a
rare breed there are rare breed yes and
you know what I will say the active key
I would take over the alerts letter you
would take the ACT acute because you can
program the active key to do whatever
you want exactly there are certain
applications like if I'm working out I
hold the key to go to my my fitness
tracker right where I put in my reps in
the way that I've been lifting and then
if I just tap it it's for bill guard i
use that to track my expenses nice easy
when I had it I had a long press to go
to the Action Center so I could have the
flashlight and a lot kind of stuff and
short press went right to ingress cuz
the Gauss guess it is the best phone for
ingress in history nice yeah that's the
thing we need new inputs and Android and
yeah if one plus is going to start this
whole you know notification slider is
what I keep calling it yeah notification
toggle rather then that's fine too but
man I would have loved the note 5 even
more if it had a key ok if ya not if
they had to be called active key you
know the fair fair enough to believe
that the s pen comes on and you have 3
no 2 3 shortcuts right there right in
the air command mind you sure yeah well
you can I do you're gonna tap and back
like yeah no it doesn't fly the active
key to me needs to be a samsung trope so
let's let's remain with the theme of the
episode i want to tell you go buy sell 1
+ 2 y i want to talk about USB type-c in
a second but no no let's let's remain
with the name of the episode in the
sense that let's recall that this is a
half a samsung episode and let's put
ourselves in the position of a buyer
right now it's coming up and back to
school season I don't know if that
informs your view or not but you want to
buy a phone you're looking at the most
hyped phones right now in the space
assume you're aware of the of the 1+2
because it's you know I feel like I feel
like some people in the real world know
about it yeah well I've seen one plus
one in the wild have it yeah I don't
think I am
but so assume that assume that it's
known the galaxy the samsung stuff is
certainly know what what do you pick now
we talk about these two are in this
we're talking about the one glass tube
or one of the new Samsung devices
announced today well there are so many
different people that would go into
cooking at split this way I would love
to say that i would pick the note 5 as a
college student yeah they still don't
let use your phones in class is that
true I last I went you know like I do
you like that's not sure if you're like
my own collagen collagen even when I
went to school there were people who
would sit next to me with the AT&amp;amp;T tilt
the HTC tilt you know the windows mobile
thing that would like prop up like I
think and they would use it in class
names like oh I'm so envious that they
could like you know take notes and also
like AOL instant message on the sly yeah
I feel like that that still happens i
guess it's just my experience because I
I was a communications major with an
English minor so when I when I took a
Shakespeare class out in london for
study abroad for a few weeks I know what
I did that I i I'm kind of a slacker in
the sense that you know I can get by I'm
one of those guys I can get stuff done
an hour before class when those jerks
right and I was I was good with writing
assoc creatively at the time yeah that
you know I could do that so I would come
to class without paper just sit there
and if they really wanted to drop out
jot down stuff at the time at a
blackberry bold I would just type in the
notes yeah I just do that and I got a's
on every test but i think because i had
my phone my teacher gave me b-plus so no
doubt that's the kid that's always
texting exactly i could get him out here
I still feel weird if interviewers like
taking notes on a phone cuz I'm like I
always have to say like I'm not texting
I'm taking notes oh yeah well taking it
to the fact that you think that you know
phones are okay in class now yeah okay
fine then no one seems to be the ideal
choice for college student is select for
that a poor college student right then
the poor Kyle should think about this
you know we I feel like we are so far
ahead of the general populace and I
don't mean this to toot our own horn I
mean a quite the opposite way we are so
far in the future because of the line of
work we're in
we consider this whole buying a bone and
full price thing to be a foregone
conclusion don't yet doesn't everybody
do that or contracts or so yesterday but
no I think the vast majority of people
still look at a at a contract subsidized
phone and say the notes six or whatever
then what do we see today the note 5 no
no they I know if I was gonna be it's
gonna be 299 yeah that seems like a
great deal how much is that one plus 2
329 well I've made my decision you know
the fact that you would have to sign up
for a two-year contract yeah I know I
always have to do that who cares I'll do
that we are in the land of the creditors
absolutely yeah so I think that that
there's that consideration and I think
if I were in the position given the
choice between these things I think I'd
take the contract hit I you know yeah
that's a good point and contract this
kind of award that we're not really
using anymore because even verizon is
don't know why contracts you know now
well what's now eiman plans i guess yeah
the deferred whatever though yeah
installments I could see that happening
I mean there's technically what I'm
doing with my Essex active but only
because the Essex I yeah I one next oh
yeah I'm not doing the two-year contract
how about that yeah so those are
beautiful okay oh no no no I bought it
my sand when I've reviewed it yeah I
bought it right after yeah that's how
much alike that's what I do with the
Moto X anybody go guy like I ship him
back and I'm like right send me another
one the thing is I didn't look at the
Moto X's this year so like I don't know
I have to draw you weren't there I
wasn't it was long oh yeah cool I was
not expecting that to be the response
everyone loves that day yeah Oh like who
you know wrong payroll the old I don't
know what they need to let me do with
this s6 s6 active and that's rooted
because though there's one common
denominator and every phone i've ever
used that has actually been slow and
that it's a carrier specific device
every unlock device i've ever had I've
never had problems with performance wise
Oh care for software yeah exactly I
don't want a page full of 18 tu stuff
I'm never going to use know so the thing
is like there's I know that on some
level that's not really the problem yes
lollipop has some brand management it's
just blah blah blah right let the common
denominator with everyone I've ever had
has been carrier issue so what do you
think what do you think about the 1+2 as
it relates to the 1+1 in many ways these
phones there are so many thumb at at
commonalities between the Samsung stuff
in the oneplus stuff because the
commenters on all the 1+2 stuff or like
flagship killer 4 2016 this isn't even a
flagship killer now a lot of people are
taking umbrage at one plus as
positioning of this thing and saying it
hiked it too much because it's not gonna
live up to it I anything I think as
someone asked me after who who has me I
don't remember but if someone asked me
while we were out the Essex the notes
the day what is going we are both lists
I had the big event at the big event
that that they asked me what's your one
sentence review of the one plus two
solid hmm but not a flagship killer so
if you want to feel like you have a
flagship get the 1+2 but I just hope you
don't have phone interview for things
like want HD for heard right for stuff
like that but you know like for pure
performance oh yeah of course yeah yep
there it is no its way up there and it's
really great and you know if we want
something different than yeah it feels
very good and solid thank God they put a
screen protector on here cuz I gash the
hell out of it already can everyone stop
rubbing in the fact that I thought that
the Imperial protector was a piece of
frivolous packaging I'm so happy that I
didn't take it off as I'm so close to
doing so and then since I'd to shuffle
so many phones today for the no.5 in the
Essex side oh yes I'll let you guys have
a couple phones doing that in my bag yes
I forgot my phone carrier this is great
if ever is this scintillating everyone
this is inside baseball yes to the enth
degree it to the point though the one
plus two is it's probably the only phone
this year aside from the s6 active
because it just feels so solid that to
me feels like the premium upgrade that
we were waiting for and for the price
that it has i think this feels really
great for a 385 318i telephone i think
dr. really great it does i think my
objections are mainly
it you know it's a it's a more common
from when you look at it next to the one
plus one yeah one plus one had a design
that immediately caught it I caught your
eye it had that weird underbite that
sort of ran around the the center of the
fund that metallic mid plate that caught
the light and glinted and the the the
camera looked better and I think as a
result of building a phone like that
I've heard or read that one plus had
manufacturing difficulties with that
they couldn't scale it as rapidly in
part because the design was not as easy
to make so this is an easier phone to
build from from what I understand from
reading some teardown stuff it's also
very rigid I guess you could say because
imagine the style Swamp covers at the
end for the 1+1 it actually was the show
yes here you're gonna have some a medal
no matter what yelps gonna have that one
little panel on the back that changes
and that's it yeah yeah which yeah
trade-offs and everything right I just
love the fact that it's if you get
another Snapdragon 810 phone and by the
way here's where everybody calls me out
for you know getting paid but Qualcomm
which you know i don't but whatever um i
love that there's another Snapdragon 810
phone out there that's gonna piss off
everybody who likes to run seven
benchmarks in a row and point to the
thermal throttling let's be honest to
batch rocks tomorrow yeah and said look
at the throne what a piece but that in
everyday use at least for me and in
games and in everything else is
indistinguishable from any other
high-end process remember I said this
earlier I'm a normal person and as a
normal person this thing has not
overheated word yeah this thing the
galaxy s6 gets hotter than it because
the galaxy s6 is thinner and made of
glass and metal and at least in my in my
case that's a good point the s6 edge
definitely got hotter than this one 1
plus 2 ever did yeah and it's a matter
of constructions I mean every processor
gets hot everybody yeah that's a whole
different help say you know the top half
of the phone gets like a little
you know it does give you can't heat it
up you and play smash hit for 20 minutes
on that I play ps1 games on this thing
manly nice yeah that and I started
getting into UFC so I'm trying to like
play UFC and it was only with those two
those main instances that I kind of got
a little bit of warmth a little bit of
the sizzle but if anything I'm putting
on my face I was like nice when is the
next time we gotta get outta here
because our breather is expiring by the
way everybody you need it this isn't a
sponsor spot this is just like cool like
if you need a room for an hour in New
York City or Boston or whatever download
the app breather it's good this is this
is the very homey like it feels yeah
it's a couch in here Edison bulbs and a
nice wallpaper there's the magazines on
the wall they give you all the
information you need to get to it also
yes the email was like you know show
your ID go up the elevator find Beowulf
