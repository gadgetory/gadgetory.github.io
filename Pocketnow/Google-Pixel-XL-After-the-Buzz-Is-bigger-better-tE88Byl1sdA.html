there's an excitement over new
technology as we all scurry to review it
then after a couple weeks we all move on
to the next new gadget how a phone ages
is as important as that initial
honeymoon period so let's do something
about that
this phone marked a major change in
strategy for Google a step away from the
developer focus of past first party
phones this was an experiment to court a
more consumer focused audience casually
described by many as Google's iPhone
with rumors popping up knowing a second
generation is on the horizon how is this
Bluebell handled a gadget reviewers
lifestyle are there any advantages here
over using the smaller variant of this
phone strap in folks it's time for our
Google pixel XL after the buzz right up
front we've already produced a pixel
after the buzz Wareheim a recounted his
experiences with the smaller phone if
you've noticed on our channel we treat
these big small releases as separate
reviews size introduces numerous
differences and how phones are used and
abused this ATB complements our pixel
video but the XL asks us to examine
Google's idea of what a phablet should
be all the more important as this is
Google's first attempt at a unified
release instead of an LG in a qua wafer
small and big options both pixels are
built by HTC and with far fewer
differences in design and features
joining companies like Samsung Apple and
Huawei for a dual flagship release
I was pretty critical of this phone at
launch it was clear that this device was
produced and delivered on an aggressive
timetable happily the XL has aged more
gracefully than I would have expected
it's rarely my daily driver around LA
but has become my primary travel phone
thanks to project Phi used infrequently
during my reviews but used heavily when
I need it it's never been out without a
case in a screen protector I was
originally an advocate for using phones
naked but the practicalities of owning
evermore fashionable devices for more
and more of our daily communication is
requiring better armor on our pocket
computers this phone has taken too
gnarly drops in airports but
corners protected by decent bumpers the
question I can't answer is if I would
have dropped this phone at all that were
smaller but I digress we don't need to
resort to aspect ratio changes to pack
more display into a similar form factor
it's nice to have more screen for
multimedia but few would disagree that
this chin bezel space is put to poor use
audio performance has also remained or
reasonable speakers but a lower pac
headphone jack is disappointing for
folks who own nicer cans and the lack of
advanced codecs for Bluetooth is a
bummer for wireless fans hopefully this
is improved with Android oh and the
early focus we've seen on higher quality
audio but the pixel has not been leaned
on much for my multimedia consumption
software really is the name of the game
here the pixel started out snappy and
remains one of the best performing
phones in my collection even facing down
more powerful hardware the XL handily
competes for UI navigation where I
experienced fewer instances of the phone
halting before executing a command all
devices can be forced to lag if you
drive them hard enough but the pixel
easily delivers the most consistent
Android experience we've yet reviewed
that it feels just as snappy today as it
did out of the box is a phenomenal
accomplishment more than just getting
patches in bug fixes quickly we've
noticed some subtle but appreciated
improvement battery life has been a nice
perk the phone bench is about the same
as when we initially reviewed it but the
way this phone handles background tasks
and doze low-power modes have been
refined where I end the day with a
little more juice than when this phone
was new another terrific example
software can't really fix the lens
flaring issues on this camera but the
video no longer suffers from such an
inaccurate crop in the view finder
software stabilization still alters the
view slightly but we can far better
trust the framing of a shot now than we
could at launch otherwise this camera
remains the top option for folks who
only ever want to interact with a
shutter button speedy processing great
noise reduction smooth video in good
light people who enjoy a bit more
control will still likely be
disappointed by this hardware software
combination just to drive the point home
about support while shooting this video
I got yet another update sent to the
phone see these numbers mean something
we don't want these updates to climb
higher just for the sake of having
higher numbers here when spending a lot
of money on a gadget we should expect a
part of that price tag to include
support improvements and evolution and
that largely boils down my pixel exile
experience in a nutshell I don't turn to
it as a multimedia or content creation
solution instead it's one of the best
performers I've used for daily computing
the fewest headaches the cleanest
example of UI and navigation and native
integration of Google services without
competing bloatware
the only problem I don't really need a
phablet for all that a big phone is most
successful when there's purpose behind
the increase in dimensions some phones
make an excellent argument for why you
should use all of your attention both
hands and your eyes to operate them but
lately we seem to be pushing screen
sizes simply for the benefit of having
larger screens every time I wrap up a
trip with the pixel XL I'm glad I had it
I'm glad I had a powerful reliable
device I'm glad I had project fine
I'm glad to know I'm getting great
updates and support shutting the phone
down at the end of a trip I'm happy for
all of these reasons and yet I still
kind of wish I'd gotten the smaller
pixel instead and of course we want to
hear from you the critical success of
this phone makes a pixel to a pretty
safe bet what do you want to see in the
next big pixel should Google help LG and
Samsung Drive a new display aspect ratio
