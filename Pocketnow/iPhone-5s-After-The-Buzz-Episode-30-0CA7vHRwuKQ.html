new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and when it's not shiny and new
anymore I'm high memory bandwidth
it now this is the iPhone 5s and this is
episode xxx after the buzz
it's been almost six months since we
last reviewed the iPhone 5s and even
though we usually follow up on the vices
after the buzz within a three-month
period let's just say we waited on this
one on purpose but devices like the
Galaxy s5 Xperia z2 or even the yet to
be announced all-new HTC One coming soon
we're better yet with the rumours of an
iPhone 6 being ready for June would it
still be worth it for you to buy an
iPhone 5s today well the answer is kind
of complicated this is the latest and
greatest iPhone and as such great design
build quality feel in hand and usability
are given Apple has once again kept it
safe for the design and that's not
necessarily a bad thing since this ace
gray model looks gorgeous
even if compared to the old iPhone 5
I've been using the iPhone 5s since
launch date and it's held up quite well
though there is a story behind it this
device were filming is actually a
replacement unit that I swapped last
month because of some software issues
that I'll mention later I actually
decided to experiment using the first
device with a case for four months and
this one without it as a result even
though the iPhone with the TPU case fell
off my hand quite a few times it almost
looked like new when I returned it to
Apple with the exception of some minor
scratches in the aluminum back due to
limp because of the case this iPhone on
the other hand has fallen off my handle
once and you will see the minor dings on
the chamfered edges so just keep in mind
that with or without a case you will
still have to pick your poison the
internals are a different story this
Fork the world's first 64-bit mobile
chip which is great right well I really
have a hard time telling the difference
between using this phone and the old
iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 5c and this
boot significantly faster and there are
games that load faster and I'll even
tell you that the phone charges
significantly faster than any of its
predecessors it's well but that's about
it
I was really looking forward to the m7
motion coprocessor for my runs but I'll
admit that I still can't find the
improvements in my runs or on any other
fitness activity that I do all these
features seem to be more of a marketing
stunt than anything and its aren't
coming from a company that's not famous
for gimmicks the only thing that really
makes this phone stand apart from
anything in the more
and really worth buying his touch ID in
a word it's Wallace and even though it
was a little buggy in the early days
that was fixed with iOS 7.1 even if
Apple could have done a better job and
integrating touch ID with other
applications with your fingerprint as
your only password I'll admit that I
find myself annoyed and having to slide
to unlock any other phone as touch ID is
pretty much again
flawless now software is a love and hate
story some love iOS 7 some hate it I'm
on the list of people that actually do
like it but never have I owned a buggier
iPhone ever than the iPhone 5s
I had to swap the first device because I
would continuously find the phone
resetting itself out of the blue end I
find that odd since I still keep the
iPhone 5 and I didn't see any of these
bugs there iOS 7.1 has to fix these
continuous crashes and really if it
wasn't for that I would have no
complaints with the device when it comes
to how the OS runs on it and breezes
through applications like a champ and
the App Store offerings aren't getting
any smaller the iPhone is still your
go-to choice with the selection of
applications and the coolest part is
that after six months I would say that
90% of my applications are already
updated to the new UI which speaks much
better than almost every other platform
out there using the iPhone as my daily
driver for six months has also been a
love and hate story love for the most
part though again I've come to fall in
love with touch ID and I do feel that
it's made my experience with this
particular iPhone more pleasant I also
have to admit that I love the camera
it's far better than any iPhone camera
in the past and low light and it does do
some decent competition with devices
that offer optical image stabilization
even though this device lacks the
hardware whether you enjoy the
simplicity of taking burst shots without
making any changes to any settings or
getting some cool slow-motion video this
is still a great camera phone to beat
and honestly it hardly ever lets me down
I find the same pleasant experience in
phone calls people say I sound great on
there and then they sound great on mine
and that's been consistent on almost
every iPhone that I've used but even
more interesting is this
quality I mean you don't get stereo
speakers here don't get boom sound like
I'm HTC one but we compare these phones
and be honest with you we - 5s sounds
great
again not amazing like HTC's one but it
sounds great I guess my only hate story
with this phone is battery life and it's
been the same story with almost every
iPhone sadly with this phone I actually
find it to be particularly mixed
sometimes it's okay never great again
okay and sometimes the phone heats up
just out of the blue for no particular
reason and my battery falls like a rock
and six to eight hours I haven't figured
out what triggers that but it could be
that iOS is not really that well
enhanced for the 64-bit processor or
something else I've updated this phone
so iOS 7.1 and I still find the same
problem regardless of the two iPhones
that I tested so bottom line after using
the iPhone 5s for the last six months
what I still recommend that you buy it
you know this is funny
every other iPhone that I've done and
after the buzz on I've said absolutely
but for the first time ever I'll say
that it depends if you're out to buy an
iPhone then by all means instead of
buying the iPhone 5c please get the
iPhone 5s those extra hundred dollars
are worth it if you own an iPhone 5 then
you don't need touch ID then the answer
is no you don't need to upgrade this is
pretty much almost the same phone if you
come from any previous iPhone then the
answer is yes should you wait until June
to see what the iPhone 6 is like well if
you can then do but the last time that
Apple launched an iPhone in June was the
iPhone 4 and that was four years ago so
that's kind of hard to predict should
you buy this device when compared to any
of the Android phones that we've seen
this year I would say yes if you're an
iPhone person but and again the all-new
HTC One could easily change my mind and
the iPhone 5s has been a good phone but
I feel that Apple could have probably
done a better job here and that's funny
since the iPhone 5 was great
