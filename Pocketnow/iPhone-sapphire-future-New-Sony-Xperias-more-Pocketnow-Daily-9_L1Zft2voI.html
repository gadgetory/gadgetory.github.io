for an iphone in the future Samson
prepares us for a new UI with its future
SmartWatch and Sony T's is a golden
announcement to happen very soon I'm hi
Mary vetta and really sorry about
yesterday guys the problem with car
accidents is then living with these
really odd armbands this is parking out
daily the official news should I begin
with Sony as the company has just begun
teasing and announcement to happen on
august 3rd and because of the teasers it
seems that there is something golden or
shiny or bright that is going to be
announced we've seen the lakes of the
Sony Xperia z5 ultra which has no bezels
and a bright display but again we should
know more on artists thur and we will be
reporting about it now sorry about Apple
we've been hearing rumors of an apple TV
happening for the longest time the
rumors of a new model and we've heard
about the new unit we've heard about the
new remote control with touch based
controls and even touch ID but it's not
until now that things start matching
into place as trusted sources claim that
what Apple is planning to do is bring an
app store to the apple TV meaning
developers will be able to build things
that you will be able to use on your TV
this is really interesting we wonder if
that remote control will also be a
control for playing let's see what we
get speaking of Apple let's talk about
its next-generation iphone 6s we heard
some trusted sources claiming that Apple
would try to bring a sapphire to this
product and then things kind of wither
down but as it turns out Apple is just
filed a new pet and this new pen focuses
on a new way to cut the display in order
to guarantee effectiveness in the amount
of this place produced meaning that
Apple would be capable to build enough
displays of this technology you know is
implemented it's really hard to you know
confirm if this technology is already
being used and it just got patented now
but it could be that the iphone 6s bring
sapphire could be that it won't we will
see other news have the pebble time
steel for those of you wondering what
exactly that product will be launched it
seems that the temple has already built
all the units that it needs to send out
to the backers but they haven't reached
distribution centers yet so if you've
been waiting
for your pebble time seal and I wish I
would have ordered one reports claim
that you will be getting it as of next
week so stay tuned and let us know when
you get it in the comments down below
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day we've got more teasers
on the samsung gear a particularly in
the fact that apparently it's going to
try to reinvent you eyes for
smartwatches we heard about the rotating
bezel we heard about the sdk leaks and
how this rotating vessel would come to
play but it seems that samsung is
planning to make this a big deal making
this like the whole new revolution sort
of like the digital crown in the case of
the Apple watch but it does lead me to
the question of the day do you feel that
Samson has a good idea with this
rotating bezel do you think that they
could figure out something cool here in
my case I do believe so I mean what else
could you do the vessel if not use it
for something if it's gonna be there
might as well put it to some good use
like in the case of the Moto 360 where
it doesn't exist leave us a comment down
below and let us know what your thoughts
are or what your suggestions would be
