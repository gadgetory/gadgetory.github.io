changes to come HTC is rumored to make a
comeback to the Nexus game and Sampson
makes some changes to avoid damage the
galaxy note5 I'm hi meri behna and for
those of you that want your green screen
here it is there's your green screen
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with whatsapp probably
one of the favorite messenger services
in the world which also belongs to
Facebook by the way for those of you
that were worried about that yearly $1
subscription fee which you shouldn't as
$1 just a dollar it seems that the
company has a thought it twice notice
that a lot of people avoid whatsapp
because they either don't have a credit
or debit card and just decided to kill
the feet altogether which is great news
in addition to also confirming that
they're pledging against ads so for
those of you wondering exactly how
whatsapp is going to monetize it could
be through the voice calls for the video
calls that are rumored for the future
other very interesting news come from
Samsung as a even though this is not
official the company hasn't really
confronted they've done anything to
avoid your S Pen being stuck backwards
on the galaxy note 5 it seems that some
teardown spur that the company has
actually done something they fixed the
reason why it gets stuck in a way to
avoid this happening to you again this
is obviously probably weeks away from
the phone actually expanding to other
countries which just makes all the sense
in the world will see if somebody
figures that one out and gets us stuck
again because you know the way the
internet is right now some of the most
interesting news that they have to do
with the LG g5 we've got some leaked
schematics and my god everything changes
the front of the phone looks the same
but then when you come to the back the
buttons at the back are no longer there
they seem to be at the side the
fingerprint scanner is alone like in the
case of the Nexus 5x and it seems that
this is an all metal design and this is
both good and bad good because obviously
it's more premium in the opinion of some
but then again horrible antenna bars
like in the case of the iphone 6 are
there there's also some sort of a tray
at the top that could house the I don't
know connectors for microSD expansion or
whatever battery sort of technology they
envision where apparently that will be
easily removable with
to see when we get the phone in our
hands probably at mwc n even though we
do not have any pricing for the HTC vive
just yet the company CEO has claimed
that this is a major business so major
that we've got some trusted sources
claiming that HTC might let it go up to
the point of creating a new company that
spins off the HTC vive into its own
category own product where they won't
have to worry about using HTC resources
to build this product and this is a very
smart move i feel that it would be the
smarter way to go as a definitely even
though it will create my chair for the
HTC branding to remain it would be great
if the company remain focused on
smartphones and this company remained
focused on whatever else you wear but
let's see if it happens and finally the
very hot rumors today have to do with
the future nexus smartphones we've got
very trusted sources claiming that HTC
might be the company building them but
that's not just that it's as if the
phones might change when it comes to
their design it seems that for now these
phones might get a little smaller going
from five point two inches to 5 inches
from a five point seven inches to 5.5
inches in the case of the tablets and
that HCC would build both phones as a
sort of a plus and a regular variant
which makes a lot of sense but then
again given all the changes with devices
like the HTC One a9 it does lead us to
the question of the day what would you
want HCC to bring to these future nexus
smartphones because in my case if boom
sound is not making it I don't even want
to look at these and with the fact that
the one a9 lost this we're kind of
worried but leave us a comment down
below what would you want to see on this
