pocketnow.com and this is a look at the
hardware of the HP ipaq glisten which
runs on AT&amp;amp;T network this device is
really targeted at the business user the
the person that appreciates a nice
QWERTY keyboard on the front messaging
product ippity it's not so much targeted
at the consumer who wants a large screen
for a great multimedia experience the
glisten can do multimedia but with
smaller screen it really doesn't make as
much sense so let's take a look at the
device starting with the top it's really
interesting to see the HP branding on a
windows mobile device it's been a long
time since HP has come out with an ipaq
but hopefully this is a sign of things
to come in the past they've made some
really great hardware for windows mobile
up here we have a light sensor and a
proximity sensor and the proximity
sensor will turn off the display when
you're on a call to save on battery life
the screen is 2.5 inches diagonal which
is kind of small but if you compare this
to a Blackberry or samsung blackjack
it's about average for this type of
device with a keyboard on the front the
resolution is only qvga so that's 240
down and 320 across you really can't
expect to have a higher resolution
screen on a display that is so small
unless you're looking at a blackberry
for example but for windows mobile they
wouldn't put VGA on a screen that is 2.5
inches let's take a look at these
hardware buttons here we've caused start
and call end which are pretty flat but
they have they have buttons they are
buttons so you can feel them when you
press in on them here's a traditional
d-pad and it's nice to see a traditional
d-pad really helps out a lot with
one-handed usability and the d-pad is
raised enough to where you can feel for
it without looking at it which is great
there's an ok select button in the
center and then a button to launch the
Start menu and then an okay or back
button right here let's take a look at
this keyboard and we thought that the
keyboard was actually the same as the
motorola q 9h in fact they look almost
the same but they feel different the
keyboard on the q 9h is very clicky
listen but on the glisten not so much
and we're not sure if that makes for a
better typing experience or a worse
typing experience
before review on pocketnow.com talk
about the keyboard but so far it seems
like quite a good keyboard to have I'm
down here we have some 18t branding I
don't know if you can see it but it says
no warranty down here because this is a
sample pre retail version and on the top
and bottom of the device we have this
rubbery coating which extends all the
way to the back which makes the glisten
a non fingerprint magnet so you don't
have to worry about getting fingerprints
on this it also feels very secure in
hand thanks to this rubbery coating so
let's take a look around the device
before we go back to the rear here we
have a volume up and down rocker which
is surrounded by this sort of chrome
strip which is a nice touch on the
bottom we have nothing on the other side
we have micro USB for syncing and
charging and we have a nice 3.5
millimeter headphone jack in case you
want to load this up with mp3s and use
it as a media player and on the top we
have two buttons we have a really
awkwardly placed standby button so most
standby buttons either occur somewhere
around here or up here on the left but
on the glisten it's on the right it
takes a little bit of getting used to
then we have a OneTouch access button
for Wi-Fi which is quite neat I think
this comes from the the palm treo pro
which makes it easy to turn on Wi-Fi
without having to go through settings so
it's a nice addition there now there is
a stylus on this device down here in the
bottom because this is a touchscreen
phone although it's a collapsible
stylists and it feels kind of flimsy and
the device is sensitive enough to where
you don't really need the stylus unless
you're looking at really small things on
the screen which may have been on this
device back here is the camera plus a
speaker and the speaker phone on this
device is really fantastic let's take
off the back battery cover see what is
back here the battery is fifteen hundred
and ninety million Bowers which is quite
large for a device of this type
unfortunately the microSD card cannot be
replaced unless you take out the battery
that's a huge con it's one thing to have
the micro SD card behind the battery
cover but to have it so that you can't
even replace it without moving the
battery is kind of a shame but again
this is not really targeted to be a
multimedia device so it's likely that
the average person that buys a glisan
isn't going to be fumbling around with
micro SD cards so overall the device
feels solid in hand it's
small but not too small it's pocket
friendly and it feels high quality which
is great we're looking forward to doing
more tests on the HP glisten coming up
soon we're gonna have a software tour
and go through the included software on
this device will be back soon with more
on the HP ipaq glisten that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
