has been a grudge match of dueling
specifications numbers put up against
numbers to determine who's got the best
phone out there the Google looks to
escape from this kind of geekery with
its new Moto X a phone designed less for
the spec sheet and more for the real
world but how successful is this
strategy of promoting experience over
horsepower let's find out I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
video review of the Moto X from Google
what if we could build a smart phone
that puts consumers first and solves
real user problems rather than just
cramming in the latest tech that no one
needs or wants those are the bold
opening words of the marketing material
that came with our Moto X review unit
reflecting the values of the new Google
owned Motorola we'll see how well the
device lives up to that problem-solving
claim in four categories build software
camera and some general test notes be
sure to follow PocketNow on social media
so you don't miss our past and future
coverage of this device and every other
smartphone and tablet we can get our
hands on the Moto X is probably the most
comfortable Android phone we've ever
handled and it doesn't sacrifice screen
size to get there it's almost impossible
to believe the screen measures have full
4.7 inches across because the phone's
surrounding it is so petite while the
front side bears a striking resemblance
to LG's Nexus 4 Motorola has done
something completely different around
back giving the ex a gentle sweeping
curve that feels even better than it
looks
the Motorola logo sits in an indentation
on the back cover giving a nice tactile
cue for where to drop your fingertip and
the phone's composite material is soft
to the touch and just the slightest bit
grippy helping to avoid drops even if
you do let it tumble to the ground
though the phone continues Motorola's
proud legacy of solid hardware design
while it's not specifically rated for
durability it feels like a device that
could take a beating in fact it doesn't
feel at all unnatural to drop the X into
a pocket with some keys or coins even
right after unboxing it that holds true
for this
white and black versions and also the
many customizable variations that
Motorola will make available pressing
the small power standby key on the side
brings that big beautiful screen to life
and here Google reminds us that the Moto
X is assembled in the USA
with a patriotic wallpaper that also
leverages the AMOLED panels color
saturation prowess the company went with
a 720p screen over the now-standard
1080p flagship resolution but at 316
pixels per inch you're not going to be
complaining about the pixel density
unless you're one of those spec heads
that Google is specifically avoiding
with this phone the panel is bright it's
sharp and it's beautiful underneath the
screen motorola has built a special set
of guts to power the X guts that normal
folks shouldn't need to worry about but
which are worth a quick look for context
an older generation dual-core Snapdragon
s4 serves as the phone's application
processor but it's been mated to the
newer quad-core Adreno 320 for a
graphics processing that's an
interesting combination in itself but
there are two other cores here too one
for language processing and one for
contextual computing both of which we'll
get into in software Motorola calls the
whole arrangement the x8 mobile
computing system and it's protected by
the company's splash-resistant nano
coating and backed up by two gigs of ram
and either 16 or 32 gigs of on-board
storage sadly there's no ability to
expand that memory capacity with a
microSD card but Google is offering 50
gigs of free Google Drive storage to
MOTO expires which should soften the
blow somewhat while our Moto X is
running a straight from Google build of
Android 4.2.2 this is no Nexus device
motorola has included some significant
customizations here all of them intended
to make the phone more useful to the
average consumer probably the most
eye-catching feature and the one you're
most likely to show off to your iPhone
toting friends is the Moto X's touchless
control here the phone uses that
dedicated Linguistics processor to
constantly listen for a trigger phrase
so that even when it's sitting on
standby either in a pocket or in your
palm it'll wake up to take a command
when you say
okay Google now that key phrase is a
little cumbersome and no you can't
change it but using it will let you do
things like set alarms call friends ask
for sports scores or weather forecasts
most of which we're already used to
seeing from Google now voice interface
it works well enough but touchless
control isn't quite as impressive as it
could be for a few reasons first it
requires a data connection to function
so if you're in the boonies or an
overloaded network it's not going to
deliver good results at all
secondly it doesn't always respond to
the catch phrase the first time around
so you need to say the phrase pretty
much exactly in the intonation you used
when you trained it like old-school
voice styling finally and most crucially
Google now voice commands just aren't
powerful enough to make this feature
useful in a wide swath of situations if
you remember to talk to it like a robot
it'll work well
liquor stores Mattituck New York or
kayak rental marine port but using more
common phrasing like I'm in the mood for
pizza or take me home I won't get you
anywhere until users can speak to Google
now in a friendly casual manner and get
something more useful than how tall is
the Empire State Building this isn't
going to be nearly as valuable or as
enjoyable as it needs to be to see
widespread use the touchless control is
also baked into motorola assist a small
feature that uses the phone's contextual
awareness to determine when you're
driving or in a meeting or asleep and it
tailors notifications to match that
situation of these the driving mode is
the most interesting with the phone able
to read your incoming texts aloud if you
want to hear them so you don't need to
take your eyes off the road sadly you
can't respond by voice dictation
automatically the phone just gives you
the option to reply with a canned away
message again this is functionality that
would make the service much more useful
and we wish it was included active
display is the last feature we'll cover
here one you'll use more often than
either of the above it detects when the
phone is removed from a pocket or
flipped onto its front side and it
pulses a quick summary of any
notifications you've received allowing
you to act on them dismiss them or
just unlock the phone as usual its
interface takes some getting used to
but it is quite handy once you get a
feel for it almost making up for the
lack of a notification light almost
camera performance has become a huge
factor in the smartphone space and
Google made such a big deal about its
nuclear pixel camera for the Moto X that
we were excited to give it a try and
then we gave it a try we already covered
how terribly the camera fared against
the Google Edition HTC One in an earlier
comparison video so for the review we
made it our goal to shoot as many photos
as possible with the X in the most
favorable conditions we could find we
made use of the panorama mode to capture
an approaching storm system and we used
burst shot to snap some photos of dogs
in the air and dogs licking their face
to its credit Motorola lives up to the
fast shutter speed claim the X does do a
nice job of capturing motion with little
to no blur sadly though the phone's
photos also feature little to no color
even in bright daylight and dramatic
sunset lighting the images it produces
are seriously lacking in vibrance
compared to other smartphone cameras
there's a gray pallor over almost
everything and even highly saturated
scenes are washed out through the X's
vision this dock sideview was dominated
by a lush verdant green in real life and
these flowers are actually brilliantly
yellow to the eye but the X's camera
just saps the life out of them we found
that tweaking the HDR mode helps a bit
in some circumstances but if you're
looking for a camera that will deliver
well balanced and beautiful photos with
no hassles this isn't it that's a shame
too because the viewfinder software is
so simple and well thought out and even
innovative with its shake to activate
function that it deserves a camera that
lives up to that experience in the video
arena the phone defaults to 1080p at
30fps
with a record button always present in
the viewfinder so you don't miss an
opportunity for a quick video you can
capture a nice Sun
set with it and the images are actually
pretty sharp and well defined but once
again you're not going to see the kind
of vibrant colors that you should be in
most situations the video cameras real
advantage isn't exactly rare but it is
fun you can shoot at 60 frames per
second at 720p resulting in some really
smooth slow motion video there's no
sound recorded in this mode but it
doesn't matter high-speed video is fun
no matter what and Motorola was right to
join other manufacturers in building it
in here in some this camera will deliver
a fun and easy shooting experience with
its simple and enjoyable viewfinder and
on the phone the results it puts out
looked pretty good on the bright and
saturated AMOLED screen send the
pictures to friends though and the
snotty er ones will be wondering if you
remembered to take the protective film
off the lens before you started shooting
we tested the Moto X over the course of
four days in rural New York State
alternating between 4G LTE and 3G
coverage on AT&amp;amp;T our network experience
on eastern Long Island wasn't nearly as
impressive as it normally is in Boston
and our time on 3G brought back a lot of
bad memories
fortunately the Moto X will be available
on every u.s. national so you'll be able
to pick what carrier is best for you
where you live and work even more
fortunately for the Moto X Motorola's 85
years of experience have resulted in a
voice calling experience that's second
to none calls are very clear on our end
with rich side tone and wonderful sound
through the earpiece even more
impressive callers said we came through
wonderfully on their end as well with
Motorola's crystal talk noise reduction
making us audible even over blowing wind
through a car window and even over the
roar of a boat engine we wish the phone
was a tad louder in speakerphone calls
but we wish that about every phone if
voice quality is important to you the
Moto X should be at the top of your
smartphone list in terms of endurance
Google's claim of 24 hours of mixed
usage time with the Moto X is bold and a
bit overblown we were able to use the
Moto X pretty aggressively without
seeing battery
charge plummet but we were only able to
get to about 12 hours of moderate to
heavy mixed usage on its special
embedded 2209 amp hour battery your
mileage may vary depending on coverage
and how often you're firing up that
camera but you're probably still going
to need to charge the X everyday
thankfully whatever software
optimization motorola has made to get
that endurance up hasn't affected the UI
responsiveness the Moto X has been
consistently fluid and responsive during
our entire time with the device the Moto
X will go on sale for a suggested price
of $1.99 on contract and it'll be on
most US carriers by the beginning of
September that price is in line with
many other flagship devices despite the
lower horsepower of the X and it's a
further indication that Google is trying
to change the conversation from specs to
experience in that respect the X almost
delivers the inconsistent usefulness of
touchless control and the underwhelming
camera have us wishing this phone was
selling for a bit less on the flip side
though the simplicity and responsiveness
of this clean build of Android on
hardware that's at once comfortable
beautiful and hugely customizable means
this is a phone we definitely recommend
to first-time smartphone buyers looking
to get into Android so while it is a bit
overpriced in our opinion the Moto X is
also a fine smartphone and a respectable
first step to rebooting the Motorola
brand we give it an 8 out of 10
