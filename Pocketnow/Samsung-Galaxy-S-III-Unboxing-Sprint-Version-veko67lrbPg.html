pocketnow.com the Samsung Galaxy s3
already released internationally a few
weeks ago is now making its debut on all
four US carriers thanks to the awesome
people at Samsung I have a sprint
version here we're gonna have a full
review of this device in the coming days
but until then figured we'd say to your
appetite with a little unboxing video so
let's get to it okay so even just
looking at the box you can see how much
influence Samsung has had over the
marketing of this device the packaging
is nearly identical to the International
versions with the exception of a few
details the most obvious being that the
Sprint version is huge compared to the
International one which is odd because
they both contain roughly the same
amount of material otherwise boxes are
almost identical as far as the feature
rundown goes on the back with the
exception of the Sprint version having
just a little bit of carrier branding up
here and Sprint is also eliminated any
mention of the Samsung model number GTI
9300 which I think is a good thing pop
in the box open here we're greeted front
and center once we open this flap by the
phone itself which is great standard
treatment for a smart phone these days
but it's still very nice to see we'll
put it aside for a second pop out the
little phone cradle here we have the
usual array of getting started guides
from Sprint in multiple languages terms
and services terms and conditions of
service and a return envelope for your
old phone if you choose to recycle it
we've got the battery here which is a
2100 milliamp hour battery white
earphones very stylish to go with the
white device some additional earbud
plugs if your ears are a different size
than the included ones or if you just
need replacements that's nice too USB
cable nothing special there micro USB
cable rather and finally the power
adapter here with the USB plug in there
coming back to the phone
let's take a brief Hardware tour here as
we've mentioned before the Galaxy s3 for
US carriers is identical to the
international version with regard to the
casing design with the only difference
being a slightly more yellow tint on the
Sprint version here you'll probably be
able to see it on camera but it does
exist to my eye but it is so slight that
nobody would ever notice unless they
were looking for it also the only other
difference is the qualcomm 4g sticker up
top which is kind of a feature you
probably can't see it if I can't get it
in a focus here I can't but it says
Qualcomm 4G so that's easy to peel off
if you want to but aside from that these
devices are identical otherwise in case
you haven't seen it before home key down
below big 4.8 inch display panel Super
AMOLED here we're looking at ear piece
up here Samsung branding 1.9 megapixel
front facing camera proximity sensors
that echo the samsung focus choose
design and that's about it up front on
top we've got a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack noise
cancelling mic on the side here the
power button down on the bottom microUSB
port and the primary microphone and on
the other side the volume rocker moving
around to the back here I'm just gonna
pop the battery cover off unpackage the
battery from its wrapping and pop this
in before we do anything and here's what
the back of the device looks like with
the battery cover off we've got the 8
megapixel camera lens flanked by the
speakerphone grill LED flash and down
here we have expansion slot for the
micro SD card slot for a micro SD card
rather the galaxy s3 does support micro
SDXC cards meaning that the 16 or 32
gigs of onboard memory in this device
can be augmented by inserting a card of
up to 64 gigs that's just in the card
slot that's a lot of memory now unlike
the international version here
we'll just pop off the battery cover to
give you a comparison there is no SIM
card slot sprint has gone with the
integrated SIM card for its LTE phones
for most of its LTE phones this one is
no exception so there is no sim swapping
ability here just to let you know it's
clear the international version out of
here get back to this guy here go ahead
and pop the battery cover on here that's
the wrong one go ahead and pop this
battery cover on here you'll notice the
branding Galaxy s3 on the bottom absent
on the international version and of
course the Sprint branding there this is
a polycarbonate battery cover like the
Galaxy Nexus it is paper thin and very
flimsy but it is made of polycarbonate
so it should be stronger than regular
plastic that said the hyper glaze
coating on it gives it the feel of a
cheaper less high quality build and it
also showcases fingerprints quite well
fortunately though on the white one
that's not as much of a problem so there
we are the unit is assembled and for our
last trick here we're gonna power it on
for a first boot press and hold this
print version only gives us a glimpse of
the initial Samsung branding before
flashing the galaxy s3 brand in there
you notice the GTI 9300 has been omitted
from that splash screen as well
white balance gets totally blown out as
this display lights right up it's an
awesome sprint 4G LTE there's your
notification LED up in the corner there
more on that coming in the full review
more on all of this coming in the full
review and it should only take a few
seconds because this is a rather speedy
device boom and there we are
like I said before we've got a lot more
coverage on the Sprint Galaxy s3 from
Samsung coming soon so stay tuned to
