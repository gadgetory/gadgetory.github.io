tremendous demand on the iPhone 6 if CC
unintentionally leaks its own SmartWatch
plans at its own video and believe it or
not LG just made your g3 obsolete just
like that I'm hi meri behna and the
problem was buying the latest and
greatest smartphone today is that that's
just an illusion guys trust me this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
the official news as I know some of you
will be a little disappointed you
remember those rumors of an LG g3 Prime
and we were wondering exactly what LG
couldn't prove well there is a
Snapdragon 805 LG g3 with LTE cat6 that
just got announced in Korea it will be
available in South Korea at some point
though we don't have any specific
details on when that phone might make it
to the United States we're assuming that
that will not be the case as we know
that carriers take a long time so accept
something but anyways that is a truth
and you remember that announcement that
one plus had where it was teasing
something that had to do with wood well
the company just announced that style
swap cover for the oneplus one and yeah
this is a replaceable cover which is
actually cool the company actually plans
to launch even more options with
different colors and the cool thing is
that you can just swap them at some
point will cost you fifty dollars extra
though the problem is that even though
there are these options we don't have
any specific dates and we don't have a
one plus one at least many of us don't
now we've heard a crazy amount of rumors
of HTC working on its own SmartWatch and
even though it didn't get announced at
Google i/o we have this video from HTC
design and if you look closely there are
some clips where you can see the
SmartWatch being designed in a computer
you can also see it on a table being
tested for its own dock so yeah the
company is working on a SmartWatch
though we don't have any specific
details on what we could expect that our
highway CH CC plans to Wow everybody
after Android wear is fumbling and for
those of you that are wondering if it's
time to buy an iPad well we would
suggest you don't as there are rumors of
an ipad mini air in the works that's
thirty percent thinner than the current
model which would be the thinnest mini
tablet in the market but it'll have the
a8 chip we don't have any details on
touch ID yet but we assume that it will
have it and it could be cool though for
those of you that want the bigger 12.9
ipad pro reports claim that we won't see
it until next year please continue stay
tuned we'll see what we get and finally
for the interesting news of the day the
Wall Street Journal is reporting that
Apple does believe that size does matter
as the company is apparently ordering 70
to 80 million units of the iphone 6
compared to the 50 to 60 million units
that had ordered last year for the
iphone 5s and iphone 5c even some cook
back then said that he was expecting a
balanced demand for both iphones and it
turned out that he couldn't meet the man
for the iphone 5s and then the iphone 5c
had a tremendous amount of overstock and
it seems that Apple is preparing for
tremendous demand apparently the company
knows that they will hit a blockbuster
if they sell a bigger iPhone but that
leads you to the question of the day are
you planning to buy an iPhone 6 this
year are you holding out on all the hot
2k phones that we've seen this year for
the iphone 6 because in my particular
case honestly oh let the HTC One I made
up kind of happy but I won't deny am
waiting for the 4.8 7 inch model so
let's see what we get leave us a comment
