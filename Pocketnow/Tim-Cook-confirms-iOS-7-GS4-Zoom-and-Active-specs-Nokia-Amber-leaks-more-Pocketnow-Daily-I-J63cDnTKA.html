at WWDC the specs of the galaxy s4 zoom
an active get rumoured and we show us
the Nokia amber Windows Phone 8 update
i'm hi never better and i need to hurry
up because the wednesday happy hours
about to start this is Pacquiao's daily
the starts day off with the odd news we
were among the first to report that HTC
announced the black and silver variants
of the HTC One but they didn't launch
the red variant that was shown on the
website alongside new reports happen
that the company is launching the red
device along with the blue device which
begs to wonder how they're going to
figure that out if they're complaining
also currently that they're having
problems with shortages due the monopoly
of certain companies with parts so I
don't know how the company is going to
figure it out and let us know in the
comments would you like a red and blue
HTC One I like the silver one now let's
move over to Google as the company has
just announced a new type of inbox
coming to gmail very soon and apparently
this new in box will be available
simultaneously on your mobile device
tablet and also on your computer now
obviously this is going to be rolling
out soon to everybody in different time
phases as Google always dusting what it
does is actually just organize your
inbox and let your promotions go on one
feet and then you're a real email on
another to not overwhelm your inbox with
everything at the same time so stay
tuned for your update it's quite
interesting though you can opt out from
it if you don't want it now let's talk
about nokia and Windows Phone we have
some leaked photographs of the Nokia
Lumia 925 running the nokia amber
Windows Phone 8 update which is pretty
much TV art to which is the next major
version of Windows Phone 8 to come in
the next coming weeks and as it stands
you do see the FM radio running you do
see that the device will give you the
time even when it's in sleep mode and
we're just waiting for it to launch the
photos are quite beautiful as well that
Lumia 925 is actually very pretty so
stay tuned for the update it shouldn't
take that long moving over to Samsung
we've got some good and bad news we were
expecting the galaxy s4 zoom to be a
very hot device but as it turns out it
won't be a camera as some of us expected
apparently it'll just be another very
the galaxy s4 mini when it comes to spec
so let's move away from that and we've
also got some League specs of the galaxy
s4 active where you will be pretty much
getting the same galaxy s4 on different
chassis we already knew that the only
difference is sadly you will be getting
a smaller camera 8 megapixels and
probably some other changes stay tuned
these leaked specs are obviously just
reports but we'll probably know
everything in the next coming event in
June and finally for the interesting
news of the day Tim Cook was interviewed
yesterday at the d11 conference and even
though Apple is infamous for hiding
specifics on whatever they're doing he
was very clear iOS 7 is coming at WWDC
which happens on June tenth and
according to him Johnny I've had a lot
of heart in this update so you know
books to wonder I mean Johnny I've is
extremely minimalistic sometimes too
minimalistic for my taste but that leads
you to the question of the day what do
you think will happen with ios7 do you
think that we're just getting a facelift
for iOS or do you really believe that we
are getting a new groundbreaking version
of iOS I know Apple I've known Apple for
a long time and the way it works is
usually if you get a facelift you don't
get any changes in features like what
happened with the iphone 5 and the
iphone 4s and you if you do get you know
not a facelift you will be getting new
features but the same thing which is the
case of what happened between the iphone
4 in the iphone 4s so most likely if we
are getting a face of that's pretty much
gonna be it in my opinion but leave us a
comment down below do you believe that
we're getting something hotter the same
thing you know lipstick on a pig like
many people say of course it's always
for an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone
