iphone 6s manufacturing has begun
screenshots of the next generation
android have already emerged as well and
microsoft is willing to give you back a
ton of cash for a surface pro 3 i'm high
memory that I and isn't it sad that if
you buy an android phone today it'll be
obsolete by tomorrow this is parking out
daily the official news is quite
compelling today starting with Microsoft
as the company is willing to give you
back as much as 650 bucks if you trade
in your current macbook air for a
microsoft surface pro 3 now bear in mind
it's as much as 650 bucks so it depends
on how old your computer is and it also
depends on the condition and even though
this is pretty much half the price of a
macbook air still it is just one hundred
fifty dollars below the price of the
entry level surface pro 3 if you're
interested you have to do this before
july in any microsoft store though would
you do it and speaking of microsoft and
nokia the companies have just announced
the nokia x2 this is the successor to
the nokia X it is still an entry-level
phone there is not really much to talk
about here when it comes to specific
asians but still they fixed everything
that people did not like of the nokia X
starting with the hardware buttons aside
from the fact that you know it's
hilarious this thing looks like Windows
Phone in almost every way which makes
you wonder if it's really worth it to
have Windows Phone where you could just
build an Android launcher with live
tiles it's pretty much almost the same
thing links in the description make sure
you watch the video that's attached that
gives you a full rundown of everything
you can expect now let's talk about
motorola as we've been expecting the
Moto X plus one for quite some time
which would be the successor to the Moto
X and we've also heard rumors that this
phone is codenamed Victora which is
partly victorious or whatever the name
might be but we get more leaks and this
is a very interesting design actually
the leaks or of a case and we see two
separate leaks of a very big camera hole
since everybody complained about the
camera on the Moto X and could it be
that this will be the pitch for the Moto
X plus 1 we still don't have any dates
or any particulars but the
is not really as nice as the Moto X was
that's unfortunate that's our about
apple and specifically the iphone 6 says
bloomberg and a lot of other
publications are already talking about
what to expect for the launch date of
the iphone 6 apparently production has
begun as we've reported in the last
couple of days but it seems that number
one we will be getting the iphone 6 in
September and number two apparently both
models the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch models
will be ready on the same launch date in
September which kind of contradicts the
other rumors that the 5.5 inch model was
going to be pushed for later we do know
that the 5.5 inch bottle will be in
limited quantities so a minute they do
launch it they pretty much won't stay
tuned and finally for the very hot news
of the day yesterday after filming our
predictions video for what to expect for
Google i/o we got some screenshots of
Android L and yes these are screenshots
of the next generation android running
on a nexus 4 which means it'll run on
the nexus war and even though there are
some design changes it really looks a
lot like the current generation android
so it's easy to think that this will
just be android 4.5 and not really
android 5.0 appetizers already confirmed
that the next generation android will be
launched tomorrow at Google i/o we'll
definitely have a full round table of
everything we think about the event make
sure you stay tuned for that but still
that leaves the question of the day what
would be the biggest thing that you
would like for Android to change in its
future version what is your biggest top
number one pick in my particular case
honestly I would love for my HTC One m8
to be current tomorrow I would love for
Google to figure out a way to have its
next generation android run the next day
or the next week on its future or
current android phone that's probably
the most disappointing part about
android but leave us a comment down
below what is your top number one pick
yes friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is still mushy follow was
unpacking out I promised Jeff Trentham
channel as well you also follow me on
Twitter hi manish quarterly data please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am I'm every bit I thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
