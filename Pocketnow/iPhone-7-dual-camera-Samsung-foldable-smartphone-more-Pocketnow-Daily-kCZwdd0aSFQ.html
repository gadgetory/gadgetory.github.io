camera modules other reports see
Samsung's foldable smartphones making a
debut and the next bit Robin is ready to
reach factors in the next few weeks am I
another event using as much noise
cancellation as I can from CES 2016 this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market to get a moto x Pierre
edition in addition to a moto 360 two
products which we actually like you
actually have the option to buy both of
them on motorola's stole right now and
you will be getting the benefit of
getting around a hundred dollars off
from the combo of products and
apparently this doesn't glue the fact
that you choose a moto maker are you
want these products to look so it's
probably a good deal but then again
there are a lot of conditions linked to
the scripture for full details and what
you're getting now one of our top picks
for the show is the next clip Robin
because well this is the smarter
smartphone and there's a lot of
backstory here there's a lot of success
from its Kickstarter campaign and those
of you that were the original backers
we've got news that it will be available
as a februari 16 so these are great news
we can't wait to get our view and it's
coming in as well another product that
made a lot of headlines that this show
is the huawei mate 8 and our unit is
already in and this phone is gorgeous it
is very beautiful very heavy but the
user interface is also improved there
are a ton of really great things going
for this phone up to the point where it
seems that in China it's already sold 1
million units that's the news for the
stone expect our full review and more
coverage from huawei coming very soon
and for those of you interested in some
hot Samsung news for CES that wasn't
really the case for mobile devices we
did get some updates the gears too but
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that those foldable display rumors for
2016 are actually going to happen in the
second half of this year and judging by
the way Samsung handles its product
launches we assume that this might
happen by Aoife so you can expect that
we will be covering this in Berlin and
finally the most interesting rumors of
the day again have to do with the iphone
7 not something that's here at CES 2016
this time because we hear that there is
a patent for the iphone 7 that includes
dual lens configurations
and apparently one of us visit telephoto
lens the other is a regular field of
view lens and the whole idea is
obviously to improve image quality but
we wonder exactly what Apple plans to
pull off particularly with its
minimalistic design and bones so it
leads me to the question of the day
would you mind if your next smartphone
would have dual lenses a lot of people
didn't really like the LTV 10 because of
that dual lens configuration we would
love to know your opinion because in my
case I really don't mind as long as the
photos are great there was a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get those earlier
