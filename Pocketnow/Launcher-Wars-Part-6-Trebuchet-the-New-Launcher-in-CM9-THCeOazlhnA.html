of us like to customize our smartphones
and our android-powered tablets by
putting on a custom launcher so I'm like
putting on a custom rom today we're
going to talk about a little bit of both
specifically cyanogenmod 9 and the
trebuchet custom launcher that comes
with it let's go take a look this is
trev a che it looks an awful lot like
the default launcher that comes with ice
cream sandwich but it's not sure it's
based on it but there are a lot of
changes this is actually modified by
cyanogenmod Steve Kondik himself so
let's go ahead and take a look and see
what we can do well just like you'd
expect we can go back and forth just
like that because I always get asked
this the wallpaper in the back is called
beautiful live weather or beautiful
weather something like that from levelup
studio I like it quite a bit shows live
weather now I'm answered that and we can
move on let's go ahead and look at some
of the things that we can do with
trebuchet now again this comes stock
with cyanogen mod nine and all of it is
changed right here through the launcher
in the settings so let's go into
launcher we have three different
sections and and about the about says
that this is simply copy my copyright
cyanogenmod 2012 let's go to the
interface part of the home screen we can
set the number of homescreens you saw
that i have mine set 2 3 i can easily
set that to 221 even all the way up as
much as 7 I kind of like three because
it does what I need it to do let's go
ahead and leave it there the default
screen I can make this be any one of
those right now I've got it too because
it's halfway between one and three but I
can change it to one I can change it to
go the other way to three and if I have
more screens of course I can set it in
there as well cancel that let's go to
grid size this is kind of interesting it
lets you choose the number of rows and
columns that you have on your home
screen the stock is four by four you can
bump that up to five
six if I can push the right button here
or even seven by seven so you're kind of
cramming everything really tightly
together I'm going to stick with four by
four but you could easily see what you
could do with putting more stuff on your
screens vertical padding this is the
padding that you have around the home
screen you've got it broken up into both
vertical and horizontal you can increase
this right now I've got it set to zero
you can bump that up to 10 go ahead and
say ok I'll show you what that did in
fact let's go ahead and bump our grid
size to 5 by 5 just so you can get a
look at that horizontal padding will
leave at zero we'll go back home now
you'll notice that it automatically
relaunches the launcher for you which
does take a little bit of time
especially if you're doing a lot of
major changes now you can see right in
here I've got room for another row and
another column of icons so i can just
essentially put more stuff on there and
also see where my padding is my
horizontal and vertical kind of cool
let's go back into settings alright in
launcher again search bar if you aint if
we want to have a persistent search bar
we can do that and now we'll have a
search bar in every screen I don't want
to even though its stock Ice Cream
Sandwich to do that we'll turn that off
simply by unchecking that box the
ability to resize any widget is
something that a lot of the more
high-end back in the day that high-end
launcher replacements would have today
almost every launcher replacement has
this but you can then normally just set
any widget to be able to resize now when
I say any that means most not any but
you get the idea some of the newer
widgets are resizable this setting is
for those that aren't resizable you can
now force them to be able to be resized
unless you can't and if that's not
confusing enough for you I don't know
how I could make it anymore so hide icon
labels if you know what those icons mean
you don't have to have the word
underneath save a little bit of clutter
and some space on the screen simply by
hiding them check or uncheck that box
next we've got scrolling the trends
in effect this is what happens when you
move between home panels on the home
screen you can go from the tablet style
zoom in zoom out rotate up rotate down
cube in cubao or stack I like rotate
down you can play with all of these and
see what they do essentially they're
relatively self-explanatory but you want
to play around with them a little bit
and find out which one you like best
fade side pages if you want to when
you're scrolling back and forth you can
have the edge of the page that you're
just going to or leaving kind of fade
out and fade in as you're moving side to
side that takes a little bit more
processing power it's something that I
really don't need because I have the
nice transition effect so I go ahead and
uncheck that scroll wallpaper we can
even have that our wallpaper fixed in
one place and have our screens and a
move in front of it or we can scroll it
I like scrolling that's the default so
that's what I've left checked show page
indicator down at the bottom you can
have an indicator to show you kind of
what page you're on if you've got quite
a few pages it's very helpful to know
where you are specifically if you're on
you know the left side or the right side
you can also then fade that indicator
after the home screen is changed if you
don't want it there persistently then
taking up space and if you want to you
can have a divider sitting between your
dock buttons and the rest of the screen
so I'll go ahead and turn that on and
show you where that sits again reloading
the launcher there's that dock divider
just kind of a subtle line to help you
realize that this is your dock and
everything else is above that let's go
ahead and look at some more settings
back in launcher we've gone through
essentially everything on the home
screen so let's move on to the drawer a
lot of these settings are the same
number one we've got the transition
effect in the fade side pages what they
do exactly the same thing that they do
on the homepages so I'm not going to go
back over those but know that you can
have different and independent settings
in your drawer versus on your home
screen you can also show the page
indicator and fade the indicator just
like on the home screen
as well so really the only difference
here is the ability to join the widgets
with the apps which is the default
behavior of ice cream sandwiches stock
launcher if you don't like that simply
uncheck it just like that and then all
you're going to have to do to get to the
widgets is tap on the widgets button
we've got apps and widgets over there
you know let me show you that so wait
for it to reload will open the drawer
normally I'd be able to scroll across as
soon as this gets loaded in again it had
to reload the launcher the app drawer is
part of that so we'll just go across now
normally I'm at the end of my apps you
can see my page indicator down there I'd
be able to just swipe over and get into
widgets now i cannot i have to tap on to
the widgets tab where i can then do that
and again you can see the page indicator
at the bottom so you know where I am all
right let's go back into settings and
see what else we have of course my rom
manager is going to fail on us in the
middle of a video need to talk with
couch about that and last but not least
we have auto rotate auto rotate means
well can the screen rotates so let me
show you that here I am sitting at my
home screen again I didn't make any
changes but it reloaded the launcher
that's just something that you've got to
kind of get used to even if you're
looking at settings it'll relaunch when
you come out the only other option to
that is to make you manually restart
your launcher which I don't like doing
but auto rotate means you can well auto
rotate your home screen you're going to
auto-rotate other screens and its really
nice and it's really cool but the home
screen is something that doesn't usually
get auto rotated it just stays in your
your portrait orientation well if you
have your phone in a dock and awful lot
of the time like I do it's nice to have
it where you can rotate it but if you
accidentally you know get it a little
bit too far over to one side it might
rotate and ahh man now I got to wait for
it to rotate back so if something to
keep in mind so that is the launcher
that comes with cyanogenmod 9 again it
is Trevor Shea and
I believe that the plan is to have this
available for other people to download
not just cyanogenmod 9 users don't quote
me on that but it's one of my most
favorite launchers it's not terribly
over the top it does everything you'd
expect it to do and not an awful lot
more stuff that's confusing or
time-consuming or fluff that just gets
in the way that you really don't need I
like it quite a bit I use it as my daily
driver I think you should too again
trebuchet launcher by cyanogenmod if you
liked this video make sure you give it a
big thumbs up and head on over to
pocketnow.com so you can leave comments
and questions about this video over on
the article over there that's where
we're going to carry out all of our
discussions thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
