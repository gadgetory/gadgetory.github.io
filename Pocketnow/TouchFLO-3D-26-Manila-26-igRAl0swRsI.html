pocketnow.com and this is a tour of the
unreleased HTC touch flow-3d
2.6 also known as manoa 2.6 now we
showed you touch flow 3d 2.5 recently
which brought a lot of changes in terms
of how you interact with touchflo 3d so
the interface went a lot deeper
everything was very well optimized for
finger-friendly navigation which made us
think that HTC is working on a
capacitive windows mobile device and now
we're hearing about the HTC lio which
supposedly has a capacitive screen so
this is all starting to make a lot of
sense now touchflo 3d 2.6 brings some
additional changes mostly aesthetic to
the touchflo interface so we're going to
go through them now what you probably
notice right off the bat is that the
clock has been changed the clock looks
just like it does on the Android based
HTC hero so let's slide that over so you
get the clock with the current
temperature and the high low temperature
so which is really convenient because
you can quickly glance at your your
device on the homescreen and see what
the temperature is without having to
flip all the way over to the weather tab
in touch flow 3d also new but this
wasn't new 22.5 but it's new to all of
the released versions of touchflo 3d
that are out there is that you get a
variety of actionable shortcut buttons
so you can you can assign these to link
to a program or link to text message
someone would like to call someone I'll
show you all the options so you can
flick your finger you can tap the plus
icon and you can have a contact or a
bookmark a widget or a program be listed
in the grid so that's very convenient
really HTC is allowing you to bring
forward the most commonly used functions
of your device right on the home screen
so you don't have to dig in to the Start
menu and things like that so if we go
over to the next step and also notice
how we've got color in these buttons
down here on the bottom which is
actually quite nice touch flow 3d is
usually pretty flat with just gray icons
on the bottom oh and you slide your
finger to the right you don't get color
but now it looks like they've integrated
some color which is a nice little touch
so if we go over to the people tab
instead of having to flick through a
bunch of people kind of like coverflow
we now have a finger friendly grid and
you can add a variety of items to this
grid but we saw this in 2.5 the email
screen and then the SMS screen are the
same we can link over to the web where
we have large finger friendly tiles that
we can assign to our favorites or we
could search Google right from the top
calendar whoops calendar is also a
little bit more deeply integrated than
it was in Touch flow-3d 2.0 so here we
have the weather integrated we've seen
that before and there are some new views
here so we can go to agenda we can go to
week and month and day you've seen
before over to the pictures tab that is
the same same as the music weather is
also the same and settings is a lot
deeper than it was in Touch flow-3d 2.0
but pretty much the same that we saw on
touchflo 3d 2.5 that that we showed you
recently so we can go into sound and
pretty much a lot of the settings of
Windows Mobile are now wrapped in the
nice elegant touch flow 3d interface so
we go to personalization change the
background wallpaper change which tabs
you have loaded on touchflo 3d but
you've seen that before
even on 2.0 you start getting into the
more nitty-gritty settings such as
programs and storage and they are
actually skinned in touch flow 3d so
very nice so overall it's great to see
HTC evolve touchflo 3d so it's more
usable it makes a lot of sense to have
three quick shortcut buttons that will
link to whatever you want to do on your
device it's a really great idea to have
the weather integrated right into the
clock like you have on the HTC Hero and
finally we get a little bit of color
down here on these buttons a very small
touch but very welcomed nonetheless so
we'll continue to watch touchflo 3d as
it evolves and we'll keep an eye on how
it changes we'll be back soon with more
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
