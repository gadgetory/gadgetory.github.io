pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to talk about text messaging in
Windows Phone 7 let's get to it
how do you want okay before getting
started it's important to note that this
is not final Windows Phone 7 hardware or
software so what I'm gonna do now is
send this device a text message while
the screen is turned off and the device
is locked so you can see what that
experience is like just sent the message
now so the phone should be turning on
there it is we get two different things
we get a little preview of the message
about a one-line preview and that will
go away in a second and we also get the
counter jumping up to one here where it
shows a little speech bubble so let's
unlock the device and we can see that
the little live tile for text messaging
has giving is giving us a one readout
saying if there's one new message
and also it's a winky face the wink face
changes to a happy face when you have no
new text messages and it'll turn to a
frown face a long time goes by and you
don't have any new messages kind of
interesting or at least that seems to be
the behavior of how it works so let's go
into the messaging application and from
here you can see your new message
immediately by the orange text so here
Brandon has sent a message and you can
see how simple and elegantly the text
message application is laid out we get
these speech bubbles that go left to
right it would be nice to see some color
differentiation here but it's very easy
to tell who is saying what just by the
justification the left/right
justification of the speech bubbles so
we can type a message back and say hello
or of course we can slide out the
keyboard if you're using a device with a
keyboard and hit the send button now
there are a few other things you can do
from the SMS application and we'll talk
about that a second I want to jump back
out and you'll see that the the tile has
changed to a smiley face it's no longer
winking but then if I send one more
message which I'm doing right now it's
going to change to a wink and there's
the wink and you get a preview at the
top you can actually tap on the
notification to jump directly to the SMS
that just came through so let's do that
and here we are now from here you have a
few options you can
attach an image so you press the little
paperclip and let's go to the camera
roll and attach an image EMS is not
working in this particular build of
Windows Phone 7 obviously it's a beta
but if you try to send it it says can't
send message that's understandable some
other things you can do really not that
many you can press these three dots for
the application train you can delete the
conversation and now while in the
conversation view of the SMS application
you really can't do that many things
except delete a particular conversation
so you can tap and hold and do delete
there's a lot of tap and hold in Windows
Phone 7 it really makes a lot of sense
to have that extra action available and
all you can do from this screen is add a
new message so you can type somebody's
name and it will reference the contacts
database so you can easily send to
someone that's in your address book
super easy SMS application
so overall the SMS experience on Windows
Phone 7 is simple it's clean and it's
very Windows Phone 7 desk meaning it's
got the Metro interface it works quickly
and efficiently and it makes a lot of
sense the push down notifications from
the top make a lot of sense so that your
work is not interrupted when you're
doing a when you're doing something else
on your phone you can either action on
it now or you can choose to come back to
it later when you come back to your
Start screen so if you liked this video
please give it a thumbs up and thanks
for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
