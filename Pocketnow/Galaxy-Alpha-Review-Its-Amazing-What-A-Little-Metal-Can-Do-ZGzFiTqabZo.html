another Samsung but pick it up turn it
over in your hand and suddenly you
understand that it's beginning of the
alphabet name implies a fresh start the
Galaxy alpha may not be a total
rethinking of the company's design
direction but it's fit and finish alone
make it the flagship we wish the galaxy
s5 had been I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the Samsung Galaxy alpha this review
device comes to us courtesy of the folks
at 28 Mobile a global retailer
specializing in unlocked smartphones if
you want a Galaxy alpha of your very own
do what we did visit 28 mobile comm and
tell them PocketNow sent you holding the
Galaxy alpha is key to understanding it
only then does the cool aluminum side
rail register its sharp chamfered edge
and subtle antenna inlays recalling
Apple's iPhone 5 in all the good ways at
just over six and a half millimeters
thick it doesn't take much weight for
this little device to seem substantial
so it's hundred and fifteen grams filled
just right in the hand the back cover is
broken up by a divot pattern that's more
understated here than on other devices
the pits are much smaller than on the s5
and here there are tiny crosses instead
of golf ball dimples done up in a soft
touch paint job whose gummy finish helps
the phone stick to the fingers and
though it looks seamless stick a
fingernail into that tiny groove
alongside the camera and the cover pops
right off
proving that beautiful design and
removable batteries aren't always
mutually exclusive under the cover
you'll find a few of the sacrifices
Samsung is made to get the Alpha to its
pocket-friendly dimensions yes the
battery is removable but its capacity is
puny compared to most modern flagships
also while Samsung was still able to
make room for a heart rate sensor it
opted not to include microSD expansion
the on-board 32 gigs is all you get on
the plus side the older micro SIM slot
has been upgraded to the more modern
nano SIM standard and the speakerphone
has been relocated to the phone's bottom
edge
with the galaxy alpha Samsung joins the
likes of Sony and blackberry in offering
top-tier specs on a midsize phone
depending on region it ships with either
Samsung's Exynos 5 octa or Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 we have the Exynos here
both offer two gigs of ram and all the
radios you'd expect for their given
region sadly for couch potatoes
there's no IR port for remote control
but samsung's fingerprint scanner
remains built-in to the home button even
though it works better here than it did
on the s5 we're still not the biggest
fans of its swipe-based operation the
office most polarizing compromise is
probably its display at 4.7 inches with
very narrow bezels it's perfectly sized
for the phone's smaller chassis and its
Super AMOLED technology affords all the
Raven blacks and brilliant colors we've
come to expect the reason it might lose
points in some eyes is it's 720p
resolution which is lower than most
other flagships but just as we said of
last year's Moto X there's no real point
in packing more pixels into a 4.7 inch
footprint this is a high enough pixel
density for most folks and a higher
resolution would only serve to degrade
the alphas already impaired endurance
more on this in a second the Galaxy
alpha ships with Android 4.4.4 painted
over with a thick coat of Samsung's
third-party interface we've given the
company's software plenty of coverage in
previous reviews so for a full length
look at Samsung's UI will direct you to
our various galaxy s5 reviews from back
in the spring now what differences do
exist on the Alpha are driven primarily
by that screen size the quirks are more
tolerable just by virtue of being able
to dart around with a thumb more quickly
on this smaller screen the innumerable
toggles and the notification shade are
more accessible and multi-window remains
one of our favorite parts of the Samsung
experience other upsides run the gamut
from major to tiny the settings menu for
example is just as confusing as ever but
being able to search for exactly what
you're hunting for is a really nice
convenience speed demons will still
probably want to run a custom ROM or at
least another launcher on the Alpha a
significant part of this experience is
spent weight
for the multitasking ribbon to appear
for apps to restore from standby for the
clunky my magazine app to load every
time you accidentally swipe into it
we've even found ourselves waiting for
the keyboard a few times despite the
fact that we replaced Samsung's with
Google's almost immediately some of
these issues might be due to the Exynos
processor on our review device its
benchmark dominance notwithstanding
we've often found Samsung's silicon
inferior to Qualcomm zon a day to day
level and sometimes when you're not
waiting
you're wincing at the continuous pop-up
prompts at the lackluster out-of-box
keyboard at the nature UX sound effects
that stopped making sense a generation
ago we'll look forward to Samsung's
continued modernisation of its UI as it
stands now on the Alpha it's mostly an
impediment to an otherwise powerful
smartphone the alphas camera is a 12
megapixel sensor with an LED flash phase
detection autofocus and the
feature-packed Samsung viewfinder that
we've come to know and tolerate where
the camera shines is in HDR mode which
is so good at bringing out highlights in
darkened areas that we've taken to
leaving it on more often than not
daylight photos showcase Samsung's
preference for vibrant color and high
contrast though as we demonstrated in a
recent comparison the Alpha is less
blatant about this than the galaxy s5
focus isn't always as fast as we'd like
so some shots inevitably come out blurry
and that only gets worse in low-light
when the software stabilization kicks in
to salvage every last Photon just like
its predecessors the Alpha performs only
adequately in near darkness it really
prefers those brightly lit colourful
scenes where samsung's affinity for high
contrast and saturation can shine
if you're a fan of selfies don't expect
any miracles from the 2.1 megapixel
front-facing camera even in great
lighting its colors appear washed out
plenty of digital noise very little
dynamic range it's a selfie camera
camcorder mode sticks to the same basic
truths as before the persistent video
trigger is great and we like how Samsung
shows you how much storage you're eating
up on a per second basis while you're
shooting in well-lit scenes color is
reproduced beautifully in 1080p the
camera offers 4k mode as well if you're
fancy but we wouldn't recommend shooting
too much of that footage on a 32 gig
phone the frame gets pretty shaky if you
go without video stabilization there's
plenty of noise and dimmer scenes but
this is a fine video camera for most
occasions otherwise the Galaxy alpha was
never intended to cater to the
performance buff but we've found it more
than capable of handling our favorite
smartphone stressing games on day 6 of
our week-long review period we binge
played asphalt 8 modern combat 5 and sky
gamblers air supremacy until the battery
was dead and the Galaxy alpha didn't
skip a beat unfortunately it didn't take
too long for the battery to go dead the
7 watt hour pack just isn't up to the
task of lasting a full day of truly
heavy use on one of those heavy days we
blasted through three-quarters of one
battery after only about 5 hours off the
charger endurance improved marginally
once we turned off Android wear but we
never managed to get to 4 hours of
screen on time our minimum threshold of
acceptability thankfully the Galaxy
alpha is a fast charger about an hour
and 40 minutes from empty to full what's
more our SK Telecom review unit came
with a spare battery and a spare charger
in the box something that we wish AT&amp;amp;T
mirrored with its unit sadly it doesn't
so if you're not averse to carrying a
battery in your wallet or staying within
range of a wall plug the Alpha could be
the phone for you road warriors need not
apply
talking on the alpha isn't the most
comfortable experience ever thanks to
that beveled aluminum trim above the
earpiece but it offers fine voice
quality on AT&amp;amp;T in Greater Boston the
speaker phones new position on the
bottom edge of the phone is a little
tough for gaming because it's easier to
accidentally block the port with your
finger and we wish it could be a little
less tinny we'll forgive all that though
because we're grateful it's no longer
sequestered on the back cover like on
every other Samsung phone the Galaxy
alpha is available now for pre-order at
AT&amp;amp;T for about the same price as the
Galaxy s5 is it worth spending that kind
of money given the sacrifices you'll be
making and capability well as we said in
our alpha versus s5 comparison if you're
cosmetically inclined yes if not then
not so much even if you're taken with
its physical presence keep in mind that
we're very likely looking at the future
of Samsung design in the Alpha for now
though the Galaxy alpha is the first
really beautiful Samsung smartphone we
wish the Galaxy s5 was more like it and
we wish it hadn't taken Samsung so long
to release it but it's here now and if
you're someone who appreciates form at
least as much as function the Galaxy
alpha is worth serious consideration
