calm and in this video we're going to do
a quick comparison between Windows Phone
8 and Windows Phone 7.5 let's check it
out
ok so first we're going to start with a
lock screen and we can see this is a
Windows Phone 7.5 over here and Windows
Phone 8 over here and you see we have
weather here it's raining outside so I
have rain on the lock screen we have
very customizable lock screen over here
you see a facebook notification there we
only see emails and text messages over
there so next is the Start screen much
different over here on Windows Phone 8
you see lots of different tile sizes the
animation is different and it takes up
more of the width of screen whereas over
here we have a negative space over here
and a little arrow for the app list and
over here that little arrow has moved to
the bottom so if you're gonna scroll
you're still you still have a visual
indication that we can go over here and
now you see the search button is still
up here we still have the jump list that
works the same we still have a little
arrow over there to go back so you're
just gonna have to figure it out on with
it's funny so next let's look at the
meat aisle I'm gonna click that one in
this one and there's some differences
here you see share profile have posted
an update just differences in the
language really but if I go to post a
message we can choose those I don't have
LinkedIn set up over there and we don't
have Windows Live anymore over here if I
turn on Facebook we see we have security
options for Facebook so that's really
nice
notifications panel similar what's new
pretty much the same now the People Hub
you see it flies in pretty much the same
and we have what's new oops and that's
but both of those are filterable same as
usual we have recent this one is doesn't
scroll vertically but this one does and
now we have a ate together panel over
here for the groups and rooms now in the
messaging you see more buttons down here
and we also have more attachment options
see that there and we also have let's go
to the text tons more emoticons
so over here we only have kind of like a
couple pages worth but we have look at
all these tons and tons of emoji pages
and pages so that'll be fun
and we also have multiple selection for
delete we can delete all threads now
that still supports Instant Messenger
for Windows live facebook chat and text
messaging now let's look at the speech
UI over on Windows Phone 8 we have much
more options with the third-party apps
the photos hub not a whole lot has
changed see pretty much the same options
we have favorites here
these are vertically scrollable what's
new however in the album's we now have
multiple selections and you can send
them all say SkyDrive delete them send
them over NFC OneNote Facebook now let's
look at the game's hub major changes
here and the design at least
over here we have a number of new
animations
so you can see some differences there
now let's look at the music
there's my history there's history here
there's new there's new Berkeley
scrollable apps apps Zune Xbox there's
your change and we have a different
style button for the play all and we
have radio here but no more radio over
here now office has seen some changes
different style notes from no longer in
the office hub there's your different
documents listing and your locations
and pin new to start is over here but we
don't have that over here because that's
part of OneNote but it's not even
available there either
here's OneNote so there's OneNote versus
OneNote much different here's our maps
those have been upgraded
this is using Nokia Maps now we see same
buttons pretty closely the same menu
options however we have download maps
over here and we have rotate with my
current direction as well as the GPS
navigation read aloud option which is
gone from when it's Phone 8 now Internet
Explorer has seen an upgrade as well we
have Internet Explorer 10 over here vs.
9 over there so there's some new coding
support and we have different buttons
over here there's a new option for
changing customizing the address bar
button so I can choose something that I
might use more often next let's look at
the marketplace versus the store
so you see a slight design change
to the games section I kind of think
this one looks better but this one
definitely has more information
we also have the new picks for you over
here in the games store as well as the
App Store this is showing you apps that
some friends have liked or is popular in
general over in the email we have some
changes finally there is speech so we
can dictate messages here and the inbox
can conform to your theme settings if
you decide to do that next up is Bing we
see a huge upgrade on Bain for Windows
Phone 8 you see a slight change in the
button layout however we see a little
stuff over here and we can swipe to get
all sorts of other information whereas
this does a swipe at all you still have
a little notice about the picture
and also we have better search results
Jessica Alba
so here we have images here we have
media with videos and pictures and this
doesn't scroll doesn't doesn't zoom
doesn't do anything but we have a great
experience over here so lastly let's
look at the settings
there's lock-in wallpapers lock screen
which we can only change the picture but
here we have much more capabilities for
customizing the lock screen even with
apps
mostly the changes here are mostly with
the language we do have company apps
that's gonna be good for businesses
here's another big difference pictures
and camera settings we have we have a
quick share option over here and I can
choose Facebook or SkyDrive but we don't
have that anymore
over here however this is extendable
with apps so that's a quick look at some
of the big changes between Windows Phone
7.5 and the new Windows Phone 8 I hope
you enjoyed this video be sure to give
us a thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
