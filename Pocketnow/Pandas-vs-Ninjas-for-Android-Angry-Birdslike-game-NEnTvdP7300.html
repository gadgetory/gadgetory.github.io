now calm and today we're checking out an
android game called pandas vs ninjas
it's actually a blatant clone of the
popular angry birds game only instead of
birds and pigs we have pandas and ninjas
it obviously can't top the original but
it does recreate the addictive style of
gameplay to some degree let's check it
out alright so this is actually the beta
version of the game the full version is
supposed to be out soon with a hundred
levels of gameplay let's go ahead and
unmute and press play as you can see we
have four areas to choose from I'll
start with the first now in this beta
for this particular area we get to play
through the first 10 levels I'm going to
start with level 9 and right off the bat
you're going to see it's a lot like
Angry Birds so over on the right here we
have these ninjas let's go back for a
second we have these ninjas and they're
enclosed in this structure made out of
it looks like bamboo stones and I
believe glass so if we pan over here
bang we have this giant panda and then
we have these smaller pandas in his arm
and over here on the side so the idea
here is to get throw these pandas over
to the other side and destroy the ninjas
you know how angry birds works it's very
similar anyway in Angry Birds we have a
giant slingshot that we use to fling the
birds across the stage in this game
we're going to toss them using this
giant panda so to do that we pull back
on the Panda and the farther back you
pull the Panda the more power you're
going to put into the throw and also if
you move your finger up and down on the
screen you can see him sort of setting
his sights so that's the angle in which
you're gonna throw the baby panda took
me a while to figure that out but I
guess I eventually got it so we'll toss
it at this angle this looks good
okay looks like it took out three ninjas
nope took out another one at the last
second so I have two more attempts here
let's see if I can get it all right so
it looks like I finished it off here we
are the next level where it's
introducing a new character it looks
like it's a panda wearing a superhero
outfit and it's telling us to tap on the
screen when it's in mid-flight in order
to thrust it forward sort of like a
special move that causes more damage now
this should look very familiar to those
of you who have played through a handful
of Angry Birds stages because in that
game we have the same exact thing only
it's a yellow bird character let's go
ahead and see how it looks here so pull
back on the Panda and i'll be sure to
tap on the screen in mid-flight ok so
the same exact effect hopefully we can
take these two ninjas out hip so I only
have two left try and finish it off
before we move on okay so one left okay
so it looks like I beat this level so
before we wrap up here let me just show
you one more thing I'll go to the second
area in level 4 so we have a change of
scenery and some new structures is pan
over and then bang no more large panda
to toss our smaller pandas I'm not sure
if he's going to make another appearance
later on in the game but now we have
this spring-loaded mechanism to launch
our pandas about so it's a little
strange that I would switch it up here
but I would say this is a lot closer to
the slingshot we use an angry bird so
sort of goes along the same lines as I
was mentioning earlier where the game
just starts to look more and more like
Angry Birds as you progress see if you
can
look out that ninja looks like he's
still alive their last shot looks like
I'm going to be one ninja short so this
was pandas vs ninjas the beta is
available in the android market for free
and the full version is listed as coming
soon with a hundred levels of gameplay
it's actually getting mixed ratings so
far people either love that it's so
similar to one of their favorite games
or they despise the fact that it's a
ripoff of such a classic title so what
do you guys think will you play the full
version when it comes out or boycott the
game all in the name of Angry Birds let
