Pacquiao calm and today we're checking
out an Android game called pandas versus
ninjas it's actually a blatant clone of
the popular Angry Birds game
only instead of birds and pigs we have
pandas and ninjas it obviously can't top
the original but it does recreate the
addictive style of gameplay to some
degree let's check it out alright so
this is actually the beta version of the
game the full version is supposed to be
out soon with a hundred levels of
gameplay let's go ahead and unmute and
press play as you can see we have four
areas to choose from I'll start with the
first now in this beta for this
particular area we get to play through
the first ten levels I'm gonna start
with level 9 and right off the bat
you're gonna see it's a lot like Angry
Birds so over on the right here we have
these ninjas let's go back for a second
we have these ninjas and they're
enclosed in this structure made out of
it looks like bamboo stones and I
believe glass so if we pan over here
bang we have this giant panda and then
we have these smaller pandas in his arm
and over here on the side so the idea
here is to get throw these pandas over
to the other side in the destroy the
ninja you know how Angry Birds works
it's very similar anyway in Angry Birds
we have a giant slingshot that we use to
fling the birds across the stage in this
game we're gonna toss them using this
giant panda so to do that we pull back
on the Panda and the farther back you
pull the Panda the more power you're
gonna put into the throw and also if you
move your finger up and down on the
screen you can see him sort of setting
his sights so that's the angle in which
you're gonna throw the baby panda it
took me a while to figure that out but I
guess I eventually got it so we'll toss
it at this angle this looks good
okay looks like I took out the rain in
just nope
took out another one at the last second
so I have two more attempts here let's
see if I can get it alright so it looks
like I finished it off here we are the
next level where it's introducing a new
character it looks like it's a panda
wearing a superhero outfit and it's
telling us to tap on the screen when
it's in mid-flight in order to thrust it
forward sort of like a special move that
causes more damage now this should look
very familiar to those of you who have
played through a handful of Angry Birds
stages because in that game we have the
same exact thing only it's a yellow bird
character let's go ahead and see how it
looks here so pull back on the Panda and
I'll be sure to tap on a screen in
mid-flight okay so the same exact effect
hopefully we can take these two ninjas
out yup so I only have two left try and
finish it off before we move on okay so
one left okay so it looks like I beat
this level so before we wrap up here let
me just show you one more thing I'll go
to the second area in level 4 so we have
a change of scenery and some new
structures that span over and then bang
no more large Panda to toss our smaller
pandas I'm not sure if he's gonna make
another appearance later on in the game
but now we have this spring-loaded
mechanism to launch our pandas about so
it's a little strange that I would
switch it up here but I would say this
is a lot closer to the slingshot we use
an angry bird shake sort of goes along
the same lines as I was mentioning
earlier where the game just starts to
look more and more like Angry Birds as
you progress see if you can
look out that ninja looks like he's
still alive their last shot looks like
I'm going to be one ninja short so this
was pandas versus ninjas
the beta is available in the Android
Market for free and the full version is
listed as coming soon with a hundred
levels of gameplay it's actually getting
mixed ratings so far
people either love that it's so similar
to one of their favorite games or they
despise the fact that it's a ripoff of
such a classic title so what do you guys
think will you play the full version
when it comes out or boycott the game
all in the name of Angry Birds let us
know in the comments and make sure to
