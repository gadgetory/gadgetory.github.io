recent leaks belonged to another phone
google and timo will start to play nice
with binge on an oppo decides to tell
your selfie camera that it needs more
megapixels I'm hi Mary vetta and the
biggest problem with this weather is
when people tell you that you need a
manicure after your recent review this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with Oppo as the company has
just launched its new are 9 and r 9 plus
and well the Snapdragon 650 2 and 4 gigs
of RAM weren't a surprise nor was the
new design what really changed
everything is that 16 megapixel camera
combo meaning both cameras or 16
megapixels just because you need a
better you know resolution for your
selfies I guess other official news that
aren't so positive come from next bit
because the Robin CDMA variant is
getting cancelled the company is
apologizing and confirming that they
were probably too optimistic for the
market and it makes sense guys this is a
start-up and so far the next bit Robin
is a great product particularly for the
humble beginnings of this company we
don't know exactly what options you have
if you already ordered the CDMA variant
but I suggest you hit the link of the
scripture for more details another very
interesting development comes from
Samson the company pretty much cancelled
its milk service law recently but now we
get samsung music arriving in the Google
Play Store it's currently only available
for Samsung Galaxy devices running
marshmallow meaning pretty much the
latest galaxies and the galaxy note 5
whichever one was already being updated
and the only thing about it is we don't
notice any subscription service here
it's currently still in beta though so
it could be that that is the purpose
because if not then this is pretty much
just another music player doesn't really
make any sense can you believe we are
still in official news let's talk about
Google now deciding to play nicely with
t-mobile by joining their binge on
service meaning that if you're a paid
subscriber you now have the option to be
able to stream youtube video in addition
to also discovery go and also Google
Play Movies
pretty much without affecting your data
plan the only problem with Ben John is
you know that it will get throttled and
Google does tell its customers that that
is going to happen but still free is
free isn't it and finally the
interesting news that they have to do
with apples feature iPhones because uh
well let's start with the oled iphone we
hear rumors that instead of waiting
until 2018 for this possibility it might
be able to make it in 2017 according to
some very trusted sources that know
about the supply chain but in addition
to that we do also hear something from a
zoo that's interesting if you remember
those antennae lines that were curved
the well they belong to a meizu phone
they don't belong to the iphone 7
meaning there are still possibilities
that those rumors that the antenna lines
are disappearing could happen but it
leads me to the question of the day what
all the recent rumors of the future
iPhones do you feel that Apple really
stands water with no antenna lines and
just major changes do you think that
something important substantial has to
come in my case I do especially after
reviewing devices like the Galaxy s7 s7
edge Apple needs to do something really
good with the iphone 7 to continue with
its momentum leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
another very interesting development
really another very interesting
development come from phone meeting it
could still be oh my god Oh friends you
