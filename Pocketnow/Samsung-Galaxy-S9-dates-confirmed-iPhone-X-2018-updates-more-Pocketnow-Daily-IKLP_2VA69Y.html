just got confirmed iPhone 10 claimed to
dominate various markets when it comes
to sales figures and our coverage of CES
2018 includes synaptics Sony and other
products that are awesome I'm Jaime
Rivera I definitely needed more time at
the CES but we made our first collab
video today expect it tomorrow because
I'll be traveling and I won't be able to
get you the daily this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
our coverage of CES 2018 we've recorded
a ton of videos but we're a man short so
it's taken us a while to be able to put
them together stay tuned we've already
got Sony synaptics we've got some
coverage as well from other products
that really made some headlines at CES
stay tuned for that again link in the
description for more information on our
playlist to talk about t-mobile those of
you that are looking for
buy-one-get-one-free deals you know
t-mobile is your carrier for that the
company is offering some for both the
galaxy's LG's and iPhones in the market
the only interesting part is that we see
unusual restrictions this time you can
learn more about these in the
description as well sorry about the
huawei mate n throw again one of the
things that we were expecting at CES was
a partnership of the US carrier to make
the launch of this which is one of our
favorite phones of 2017 easier in the
United States as it turns out we also
hear that AT&amp;amp;T was not the only carrier
we hear that Verizon was as well we hear
a couple of complications we have a full
article on the reasons why in the
description as well now let's talk about
iPhones particularly the iPhone tennis
this device has pretty much broken all
the records that analysts were
predicting to the point where it has
claimed that the phone has been pretty
much leading the United States the UK
China and other markets and if you want
full details on the amount of numbers
and everything they're in the
description motion point apparently
Apple is already gearing up for its 2018
iPhone 10 with this huge partnership
with LG in a way that it can ensure that
we won't have any issues getting the
phone whenever it launches and finally
the very hot news today actually has to
do with CES in Samsung's press
conference obviously we saw
refrigerators we saw televisions sell a
lot of amazing things but
in porn DJ coke came on record and
confirmed that we can expect the Samsung
Galaxy S nine at MWC 2018 in Barcelona
this would make a comeback of the galaxy
lineup - MWC which is great we will be
covering the show live but we wonder in
the question today do you think that
it's the smartest for Samsung to launch
the phone earlier or in the same
timeframe that it launched this year
well pretty much last year with the
Galaxy s8 in my case I feel that the
earlier the phone launches the better
the way can mitigate the damage of the
iPhone 10 right now but that's just me
it was a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
