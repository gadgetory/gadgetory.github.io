bb10 Nokia's mwc 2013 event gets
official and Microsoft forgot to add
some storage to their surface pro I'm hi
meri behna and so far the game is going
Barcelona one grandmother 80 this is
parking out daily that's right Nokia's
just come clean with their plans for mwc
2013 they're already scheduling an event
to happen on the first day which is on
febuary 25th now the biggest question is
what are we gonna get at this event
because pretty much the Lumia 920 is
news right now so let's see what happens
at the event will definitely be there
covering it live and speaking of Lumias
no kit has just brought us the almost
perfect good news that Windows Phone 7.8
is now gonna be available further
exiting Lumia devices but the problem is
that in our specific dates and sadly
they said it's coming in the coming
weeks because they have to wait on
carrier so the way this happens as you
connect your legacy Lumia device to the
zune software on your computer and hope
that everything goes right so start
connecting and what do you know new
leaks have the nexus for coming out in
white yeah yeah I know that that's that
phone that you're currently having a lot
of trouble trying to buy you know that
LG Nexus 4 that's never available in the
Google Play Store it comes out right now
and then it sells out well LG is
apparently going to bring it out and
white as well and it just begs to wonder
if they're actually gonna figure out how
to sell it as well we'll see and speak
of ironic news Microsoft has set the
internet on fire yesterday night because
well remember that surface pro tablet
the one that can run windows 8 that can
allow you to run just about every
application that you want what the
problem is that that device you know the
64 gig entry-level model it cost 900
bucks it's sadly only going to give you
twenty three gigabytes available of
storage so it makes you wonder what
exactly are you gonna install on those
23 gigabytes what's pro about a device
like this I mean you can buy a macbook
air you know a full-fledged macbook air
64 gigs and it only takes up like six
Inga bytes of storage for OS 10 and then
the rest is available to you so well
Adam Lane was nice enough to prepare a
full editorial on how to get rid of some
stuff from windows 8 to allow you to
make the most
out of your service pro but just think
before you buy and finally for the hot
news of the day rim has just announced
that they're changing their name they're
not just going to be called blackberry
and so forth they've been ounce their
blackberry 10 operating system along
with their blackberry z10 and q10
Michael Fisher already has filmed some
hands-on coverage of the z10 which to be
honest with you looks really really cool
the design proudly is not the best in
the world but the OS itself is actually
really cool and somehow blackberry has
figured out how to get some really cool
applications in there and well that begs
for the question of the day why
blackberry I mean why would you ever
consider moving from your iOS device or
Android device to blackberry let me just
think about it it's a new operating
system that looks really cool and it's
not really forcing you to do anything
like to move into their proprietary UI
and stuff like Windows Phone now they're
offering something similar and some
really compelling app so in my
particular case I do want a z10 but I'm
still on the ropes thinking I mean have
they really figured it out because only
seventy percent of the apps that I want
are there right now so leave us a
comment down below what would you need
to move to blackberry and if you want
another scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
roll make sure you follow us on parking
I'll calm and subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi never let up thanks for watching and
there is a lot more blackberry 10
coverage coming up and the z10 as well
so make sure you stay tuned
plans for mwc 2013 they're already
scheduling an event to happen on the
first day I have choking it was a joke
sorry it was a joke and it had a teacher
in high school was always like it was it
he couldn't speak English well he was
always like it was a check so they
called a guy mr. Chuck
