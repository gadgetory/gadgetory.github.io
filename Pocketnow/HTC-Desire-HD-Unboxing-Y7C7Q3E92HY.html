i got a treat in the mail today and i'd
like to show you the unboxing of it it's
the HTC Desire HD let's go look alright
so here we go with the HTC Desire HD now
this is an Android phone it's got some
pretty impressive specifications on it
the least of which is of this huge
mammoth screen in fact looking over at
the specs on the back of the box we've
got a 4.3 inch display all kinds of cool
stuff but that's not what you're
interested in you want to see what's in
the box
so let's go ahead and do that unlike
other Android boxes that lift up this
one slides up and inside we have the
device it's wrapped in this protective
screen very nice device this is like a
Nexus One but a little bit bigger at
least the screen is ginormous dual flash
all kinds of cool stuff we'll come back
to the phone in just a minute inside
here we've got your necessary stuff
smart start the guide contact us
warranty a bunch of other stuff that we
really don't care about in these we'll
come over here into the box and we've
got since this is a non US native phone
we've got this little adapter that's a
an adapter for the power now what kind
of power do we have well just the
regular HTC wall wart and then this of
course is where you connect the two
together which of course doing on camera
is not as easy as you'd think
so if I were non-us that would be what I
need to plug into the wall now it's
unfortunate that there isn't a u.s.
prong on it so I'd have to get another
one of these wall plates to do it but
it's USB so I don't really need to worry
about that let's go ahead and see what
else is in here of course you've got the
USB cord and I really like how you've
got these Roundy
if you will they're just a little bit
nicer to look at a little bit nicer to
plug in and plug out but that's all I
need I can take and plug this microUSB
cable into a regular USB port or into
another USB wall wart and be able to
supply power to this device so if you
are in the u.s. or really anywhere else
in the world that uses a different prong
setup than this you're okay just go
ahead and plug into your existing device
and you're just fine we also have a nice
headset which has some squishies in a
clip
I won't open those right now right there
in here so kind of like we're used to a
really nice looking headphone jack
kind of slim not quite as slim as what
you'll see on the Apple products but
slim nonetheless and then of course it's
got your microphone right there with see
if I can get it out your up/down call
answer play pause track next yada yada
yada right there so nothing unusual so
let's go ahead and take a look at of the
device itself okay first of all we're
gonna take off this protective membrane
and it has a little hint up here on the
top to show you where you can pull that
tab to get it off I'll just move that
out of the way now first and foremost
this is a huge screen I mean huge to
show you what it looks like compared to
a g2 we're lookin huge screen but moving
right along up at the top we've got a
very large speaker with a little LED
flash indicator down on the bottom we
have our capacitive buttons which are in
the same orientation as the g2 home menu
back and search and menu is spelled out
it's no longer the menu icon
HTC branding on the bottom since this is
an HTC phone down on the bottom you've
got microphone micro USB and your
headphone jack moving over here to the
side you've got your volume up down
rocker it looks like but wow that's
funky okay so this isn't a rocker up
here it's this
button right there and then down there
so it's not really a rocker it's more of
a soft area of the phone that you can
push in to get it going up and down so
that's unusual I have to see how that
works out power button is on the top
over on the other side is blank and then
over on the back you'll notice this is a
very rounded I don't know if you can see
that very well on camera but it's a very
rounded back which fits very nicely in
the hand especially the curve of the
palm right here so it feels really nice
but coming back to this we've got our
noise cancelling microphone our 8
megapixel camera which will also do 720p
video HD video and then a dual flash now
I really like the dual flash on there as
if one flash weren't enough to blind you
you got two down on the bottom we've got
some branding for Dolby mobile &amp;amp; SRS Wow
HD sound and then of course the large
silver HTC logo on the back all in all a
very nice very solid phone so there you
go with the unboxing this is the HTC
Desire HD in future videos we'll get
into first boot we'll get into what
comes on the device what the Sense UI
looks like on it and all kinds of cool
stuff so make sure you subscribe to this
playlist which I'll give you a link
right here subscribe to the playlist
subscribe to our Channel and of course
if you want to see unboxings like this
give us a thumbs up for pocket now I'm
