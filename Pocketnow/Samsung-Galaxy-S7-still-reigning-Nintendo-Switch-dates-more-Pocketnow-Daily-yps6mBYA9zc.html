the future Nintendo switch even with the
galaxy note 7 issue Sampson continues to
reign supreme in the smartphone market
and the Google assistant begins to get
some third-party expansion I'm high
metal iveta and yeah i know this video
was for yesterday this whole update for
Final Cut just made things really crazy
but I think I figured it out this is
pocket out daily if I shall lose today
start with the Android wear offerings on
the Google store if you notice the
company has been removing a lot of
watches that are relatively new like for
example 2 casio watch in addition to
others we now get more options that are
mainly coming from fossil because the
fossil group is in charge of the
company's q founders in addition to
Michael Kors and yet other brands that
again have everything to do with fossil
edition you do see the polar I'm 600 and
others but yeah you want it to buy the
others on the Google store you'll have
to try your luck somewhere else and then
when it comes to Google is a support for
third parties with the Google assistant
it's kind of working backwards right now
as if this then that and Google
assistant are now talking to each other
and what this means is that whatever
triggers you want to set between one
service and the other will actually work
so yeah you can turn on your light lamps
at home and other services obviously
this is not perfect yet we really want
Google to provide support for other
companies like uber lyft etc and we
should wait for that coming soon after
those of you that are in the market to
buy a new computer and you're probably
holding an old Mac you might want to
consider Microsoft's traded program
which just came into effect if you're
looking for a surface book or surface
pro 4 you could pretty much come with
any Mac that you have that's dated up to
two thousand six and Microsoft will
recognize up to six hundred fifty
dollars depending on the condition of
the product and give them the resilience
of max that could mean a lot of money
you should actually consider it it's not
bad at all i'll talk about nintendo most
of us were waiting to see when to expect
a nintendo switch the company only
teased it now we know that on January
thirteenth we will know when it's not
that we're getting it is that the
company will announce pricing and
availability of the product so set your
calendar
I will definitely not sleep that thing
and finally the hot news that they have
to do with the IDC and the usual
statistics that we get every quarter
over which companies are reigning
supreme sams and continues to be the
best even with the recent embargo of the
galaxy note 7 followed by Huawei but
interesting very closely behind Huawei
is oppo oppo has been struggling between
that second place for the longest time
the company has actually wanted a couple
of times but yeah it's very interesting
to see that Samson continues to be
raining even though it does lead me to
the question of the day if you had to
narrow down every single company in what
these companies have done during the
year which company would you say has
provided the most innovation in my case
to be honest with you I would say that
my favorite phone of the year would be
the HTC 10 believe it or not it's
probably not the most perfect phone but
I feel it to be the most delightful I
really love what HTC has done this year
even though the company is nowhere close
to be at the top of the food chain but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion on that friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed all of us I'm out calm
