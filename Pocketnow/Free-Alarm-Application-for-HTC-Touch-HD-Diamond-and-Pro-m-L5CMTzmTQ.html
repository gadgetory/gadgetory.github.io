pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you a free security
application for the HTC touch pro touch
HD and touch diamond it uses the
accelerometer inside your phone to sense
movement so that if somebody picks up
your phone and alarm goes off now why
would you want this well let's say
you're at work or you're at school and
you leave your phone out on the desk you
don't want someone to steal your phone
you don't want someone to pick up your
phone and start using it this may be a
good application for you okay so right
now I have my phone armed on the desk
and it's off and the second I pick it up
you're going to start hearing beeping
because the motion sensor is going to go
off and there we go and now I turn it
off by turning on the screen and this is
very knowing i know but that's that's
good 1 2 3 4 is my deactivation code and
it will stop now there are a few
settings that you can go through on this
program you go into menu down here and
click settings we can set a delay so
that when we press the Run button it
doesn't go off immediately after it
senses our movement you can have several
seconds to wait until it actually
activates we can do other things like
have it run a program when the alarm
goes off if we go into deactivation we
can change the deactivation code and if
we go into the third tab there alarm we
can change the sound that is used I'm
just using the / windows / ring / alarm
hyphen beeps dot wave sound which is
basically a sound that's a ringtone
option on windows mobile devices but you
can put your own alarm sound on here of
course the program is called don't touch
me and I will post links on pocket nail
calm on how to get it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
