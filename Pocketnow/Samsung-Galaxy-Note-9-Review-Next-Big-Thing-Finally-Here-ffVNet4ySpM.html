know it's funny we've spent years
hearing Samsung repeating the same
catchphrase the next big thing is here
and then failing to deliver but then
really this Samsung Galaxy unpacked
mentioned nothing no overhyped
catchphrases no gimmicks heck we even
saw products announce that we weren't
really expecting and yet this is the
first time that I actually filled the
next big thing is here I'm high amenity
that I with pocket now and this is our
review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
so here's the thing when picking a daily
driver I care more about key essentials
and asked to look and feel good perform
well take great photos and that battery
life has to last me at least through end
of day sadly we're still in this even or
game when it comes to phones where you
either get one thing right or the other
but the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 seems to
be one of the exceptions for 2018 call
the design iterative all you want one of
the things that I've learned is that
design changes always come at the
expense of refinements like its
predecessor the Galaxy Note 9 takes
sighs seriously I don't think that it's
just that it's large but really the
sharp corners that make it seem and feel
larger even if it's really not that much
different than the galaxy s 9 plus I do
love the build of the glass in the
aluminum I like the ocean blue color
with the yellow s-pen even if the
fingerprints are still a thing
I also praised improvements like the
reachable fingerprint scanner even if
that only really applies to large hands
like mine I am definitely gonna call the
Galaxy Note 9 the king of content
consumption the six point four inch
Super AMOLED infinity display is still
the best in the market with great color
saturation and brightness to make the
screen larger without sacrificing
footprint Samsung shrunk the bottom
vessel a bit sort of like what we saw
with the active line dual firing
speakers also finally make the cut and
these are plenty loud for watching
parking out videos on the go and
subscribing to our channel as well
shameless plug tucked inside we have the
best specifications that 2018 has to
offer there's the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 options for six eggs of
RAM and 64 gigs of expandable storage or
eight gigs of RAM and a whopping 512
gigs of storage that you can then expand
to up to one terabyte through microSD
there's a massive 4000 milliamp hour
battery fast wireless charging and Ivy
68 water and dust resistance like
seriously everything but the kitchen
sink this is my first ever Galaxy Note
review or I actually dedicate a segment
to the s-pen I feel that it finally
deserves it this is still your standard
s-pen with it
tip that feels I give your writing with
a sharpie you can still use it to be
artistic or to doodle notes even when
your screen is off and yes it can be
your surrogate Mouse every now and then
but not all applications support
features like scrolling what's changes
the new bluetooth LE functionality and
the fact that even if it requires you to
charge it you won't really have to worry
about that thanks to the built-in super
capacitor that charges it internally in
just minutes this allows you to use it
as a remote for photos music playback
video you name it and what's amazing it
looks no different than any of its
predecessors I use it a lot for things
like OneNote for work but your mileage
will vary as to how much you use the
s-pen another thing that I'd wish that I
see this phone is running Android Pi out
of the box we're currently still on
Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's
experienced UI and well it looks and
feels no different than the Galaxy Note
8 and that's something that actually
worries me as Samsung is notorious for
taking its time with software updates
now not everything is bad I do praised
Samsung's good taste and aesthetics I
like the fact that you can glide through
menus very quickly and probably one of
my favorite features continues to be the
edge menus which I use constantly to
check on my calendar or Collin
application or pairs which I depend on
pretty much every day samsung has spent
the last couple of years being ahead of
the curve when it comes to features when
compared to stock Android and things
like multi window for example so I do
understand that this UI to a certain
degree serves a purpose I've been using
the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 for two weeks
in New York City as my daily driver I'll
tell you this much I did a separate
video that I recommend you watch on how
much this phone demolishes its
competition and data speeds we've
compared it to devices like the iPhone
10 and it significantly outperforms them
on the t-mobile network I can't really
say the call quality is superior though
but it's good performance playing games
is great features like game launcher
help and it seems that the whole water
carbon cooling system works cause I
haven't really felt this phone heat up
or slowed down in any way and asked for
the most important essential for this to
be a note pad replacement I am glad to
report that battery life is
finally a non-issue last time that I
praised the Galaxy Note for its battery
was the note 3 and this phone delivers
just as well I've managed to end every
single day on a charge and I've been
really taxing this phone as my only
device even if I usually carry two still
there are things about the experience
that I find a bit annoying I've noticed
vixx P is not as reliable as it used to
be and I hate that you can't disable the
button like you could on the know date
so I end up launching it by accident
three out of five times I pull it out of
my pocket
vixx be home also slows down the UI ever
so often when you launch it from the
home screen and I've also noticed bugs
like the phone having issues switching
between the speaker and Bluetooth and
certain apps which could be a third
party application issue and an addition
also some minor stalls in the camera but
it usually only happens in third-party
apps like Instagram which I assume are
other things that have to be ironed out
now the cameras story is interesting
because you think that this is a galaxy
s 9 plus with an S Pen but it's not
it seems that Samsung has made some
changes into its post-processing because
this phone has given me some of the most
beautiful photos that I've taken lately
the variable aperture helps that adapt
to situations you get great color but I
noticed that saturation has been toned
down to now be more pleasing to the eye
more natural I'd say I took all these
photos with a company scene detection on
and I guess they were right I'm not
gonna say that it's always accurate and
detecting what it sees but I will praise
the results the photos are gorgeous the
same goes for low-light performance
where the camera does a better job at
not blowing the highlights though I will
tell you that the issues with moving
subjects that we saw with the galaxy s 9
are still here I also love things like
portrait mode not just because of its
accuracy but because life focus allows
you to tone it up tone it down or turn
it off after the fact this also
continues to be the only phone that I
trust for selfies not just because of
its brighter aperture but because the
field of view is wider than average I
even feel that I lose a few pounds with
them which I know some people care about
and then Samsung Galaxy phones have also
gained my respect in video recording
we've got great stabilization while
walking 4k video at 60 frames per second
super slow-mo at 960 frames per second
at 720p with a little more recording
time available now I have noticed an
interesting change in the crop when it
comes to selfie video the crop is not as
tight as it was with the Galaxy has a 9
Plus but I don't notice the
stabilization that I had with the s9 +
well I don't really know if I like this
or not yet to conclude let's address the
most important elephant in the room when
it comes to the Galaxy Note 9 this phone
costs $1000 I have a hard time
justifying that price for any phone but
there are some very important things to
consider first the Galaxy Note 8 wasn't
really that much cheaper when it
launched second if we were to compare it
to another $1000 phone well the note 9
has a better screen three times more RAM
double the storage that's also
expandable more battery life and a
better set of cameras and if you watched
the speed test video that I recommended
it's also miles better and I mean miles
better when it comes to data speeds and
best of all US carriers are already
packed with deals and bundles for you to
be able to save some money if you go for
the Galaxy Note 9 again I'm not saying
that any phone is worth $1000 but if it
were my cache if I have to choose just
one $1000 phone the Samsung Galaxy Note
9 would be the phone that I would
definitely pick this is once again that
Vanguard device that challenges the
market with a lot more for your money so
far without a doubt this is my favorite
phone of 2018 folks just like this we've
got more reviews in the pipeline so make
