address all the negative rumors and talk
Android Q on its existing devices
according to ice universe the Galaxy
Note 10 will bring some very interesting
features and the 5g variant of the
Galaxy fold just got more certification
so is this the reason for the delay I'm
high metal Iveta back in Studio number
two end up sad because deagle doesn't
add any more jokes to the script I mean
you should probably give them some tips
in the comments this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
and I know I'm boring you with Apple
products but my god man this is crazy
Amazon right now has in the case of air
pots - the ones with the wireless
charging case $180 so you're saving a
couple of bucks they're not necessarily
much but if you're looking for Apple
watch series for that one is $50 off and
again I do recommend series 4 it's
probably one of my favorite watches this
year so you can learn more about these
deals in the description as they don't
last long now let's talk about vivo as
the company has made some headlines
because they've just published a teaser
for their new super flash charging
technology which listen to this is able
to take advantage of 120 watts to be
able to charge a phone meaning if you've
got a four thousand milliamp hour
battery you can charge that battery in
13 minutes I'm just gonna let that zip
in 13 minutes 4,000 milliamp hour
battery and you know what even crazier
is 120 watts I mean my macbook pro which
we used to edit these videos uses 87
watts so it is crazy I haven't really
seen the power brick just yet but stay
tuned obviously we're waiting for an
official announcement of which product
is bringing this charger because I can't
wait to give it a try now let's move the
spotlight over to Oppo as well the
company has innovated with a couple of
things like being able to have the
camera hid tucked inside the chassis and
then only available whenever you need it
but they've continued doing different
ideas like the shark fin technology and
what we saw with the Oppo find X but now
the company has teased that a June 26
they will launch a smartphone with a
camera that is under the display and
according to the company's VP there will
be some sacrifices and image quality
that are minor
according to them in order to be able to
achieve this new design and I gotta hand
it to Oppo I you know I missed this Oppo
the one that would dare these things
back in the day where we saw devices
like the N lineup where we had flipped
cameras and these were remotely
controlled and stuff like that we need
that kind of innovation for smartphones
and it's great to see that they're back
June 26 MWC Chang hi I'm gonna be
looking forward to this how about if we
talk about the Samsung Galaxy fold
obviously we're waiting for the Galaxy
fold to get announced relaunched or
whatever we're gonna call this but
here's the thing
it seems that Samsung has just sent out
the 5g variant of the galaxy fold for
certification and since we know that the
Galaxy fold one you know the LTE variant
has to go again through certification
once the design process is fixed we're
already scratching our heads over what
is the plan is the plan for this 5g
variant of the Galaxy fold to be the
final phone and they're just ditching
the LT variant because they pretty much
didn't mass-produce it I guess or I
don't know exactly what the case may be
but given the fact that the huawei mate
X was going to launch with full 5g of
this might actually be the thing could
be that the next fold or the full that
we're actually going to get the final
variant you're gonna get you know the
consolation prize that now you're
getting a 5g tablet that can be the case
we'll see what happens in the end and
now since we're talking Samsung let's
move the spotlight over to the Galaxy
Note 10 and closer to the launch which
could actually match the next fold and
we're already dealing with two different
tweets from ice universe the first one
is that the chin will be as narrow as
that of the iPhone and that the forehead
will be significantly reduced as the
phone will bring sound on the display
technology instead of a speaker this
first suite also includes screen
protectors that include the punch hole
and then the second one says that the
note 10 will bring three stage variable
aperture of the first being f1 point 5
the second f1 point eight and then the
third f2 point four and this is rather
interesting as a back in the day my
favorite camera was the galaxy note 5
that was
F 1.8 it I felt that it wasn't so bright
it allowed me to take some really good
moon shots and we also know that
galaxies have a problem in capturing
moving subjects which I think that the
brighter the lens the faster it is but
for some reason something's wrong there
so hopefully that gets fixed with this
new design we'll see
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with Huawei yet again this time
because the company has published a full
website trying to the bunk all the
rumors of everything that's being said
and obviously to put customers at ease
with all the speculation over if you
currently have an Android phone from
Huawei what is it that you should expect
for your phone or what happens if you
want to buy a current Huawei phone
that's currently running Android the
website sets that everyone with a huawei
phone or who is about to buy one can
still access the Play Store
they also say that their popular devices
like the p30 Pro will run Android Q
which is already in beta on the May 20
Pro they also reassured that all of
these phones will keep getting updates
and security patches and the website
also addresses rumors directly now even
if the list includes a total of 17
Huawei phones an internal source also
claims that even the honored 20 that is
launching tomorrow will also be on the
list of devices that is getting Android
q as one of the key honor models
obviously the long-term future of huawei
devices is still uncertain but follow
the link in the description read all the
questionnaire that's there and how
Huawei responds to it and let us know in
the questions today I mean would you
trust Huawei and continue using your
Huawei phone or buy one for that matter
because I mean I'll tell you this much
the ice is like the Huawei P 30 Pro are
awesome they're just really awesome for
me it's sad that people can't try them
out you know I even didn't publish the
review because of that everything that's
been going on but leave us a comment
down below would love to know your
opinion and let us know if you also
still want to see that review friends
