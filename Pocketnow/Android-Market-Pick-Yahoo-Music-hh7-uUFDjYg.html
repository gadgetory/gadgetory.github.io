Paco calm and internet radio has been
around for a while and today I'm going
to show you yahoo radio and this is a
free application on the android market
so let's get started so this is Yahoo
music for android devices and the
program is free on the android market
and it's pretty good alternative to
other internet radio programs such as
Pandora and whatnot so I can search here
for cities or genres if I like I can
also listen to the featured music being
played let's try adult alternative we'll
see what that has to play ok so I'll
start buffering and then of course give
us our song and free Lila Loomis down
here and if I like I can skip it ahead
if I don't like the song and skip of
course I only get six choices I think in
an hour's period of time to skip to my
next songs so if i don't like this song
and skip ahead again it just takes a
second to buffer and it's pretty cool
that it gives you the album art and i'll
shoot shows you the title and the song
of course and we can even share this
with our friends if we like we just send
us an email i can either select from my
contacts or i can input their email
address if I like and hit Send so we can
just go back I can also select this as a
favorite I can pause it let's see let's
try a different genre here hola will
choose on a hard rock okay so i'll begin
playing our song and i guess it has
reset back to 60 I was a little
incorrect my saying it would be every
hour because apparently it might be
every genre or so so you can just go
back and go back again it'll continue
playing the music even while we are
searching for other music and we can if
we wanted to we could listen to some of
the new stations we can also listen to
you some sport stations and of course
our favorites so this is Yahoo music and
the
education is free on the android market
and this is another android market pick
and if you like our videos make sure you
give us a thumbs up and also leave a
comment down below thanks for watching
and if at any time you want to download
this program to your device just
navigate using google goggles to the
image of the QR code on the screen and
snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
