the company with the worst results in
nearly eight years Twitter just killed
vine as part of an indecisive future for
the company and Apple wants to reinvent
TV with an app called TV so to speak I'm
high metal iveta and as tough as this
week has been I'm not complaining that
it's pretty much almost over this is
parking out daily
the official news today start with deals
those of you new google pixel owners if
you want to get half off that phone all
i have to do is actually take the
t-mobile and sign in to one of their
plans and there are a few that you
shouldn't learn more in the link of the
description but the point is that after
you sign up you will be getting fifty
percent off and credit over your
consumption for the next two years you
all you have to do is bring your pixel
doesn't matter what carrier be at
verizon or unlocked now as well despite
over to Apple the company had its major
event today where it refreshed the new
retina MacBook Pro which I will
hopefully get at some point but that was
not the big news that's focused in our
scope really what we concentrate more on
is for example what's happening to the
apple TV as the company really wants to
reinvent TV but not with TV content they
just launched a new app called TV and
the whole idea here is to consolidate
everything into one area we did not get
any numbers from Apple after its losses
in quarter results or at least it's the
Klein in income but yeah the event was
rather nice and those max was beautiful
another thing that was not discussed at
this event is the company's earpods
believe it or not even though we were
expecting for Apple to announce their
availability it seems that apple
recently sort of said that they are not
ready to launch these just yet it makes
all the sense in the world why would
this company be ready they're claiming
that people are going crazy over them I
think they're just going crazy over the
conan video or he just marks everybody
for losing the air pods and paying a
crazy amount of money which is pretty
much the way it's going to go i'll talk
about twitter as we begin with the sad
news today for those of you that were
fans of mine starting with my son Diego
sorry buddy line is dead the company is
going to keep the website up but it's
going to stop supporting the mobile
application it's going to work with
creators over what to do in the future
and sadly the company is laying off 200
employees twitter has been trying to
sell it sell for the longest time has
not found
buyer and trust me Twitter even if I had
the money i would probably buy you if i
would figure out a way to turn off those
notifications where you let me know when
two of my followers sorry two of the
people that i'm following are liking a
photo or retweeting something that's
ridiculous and finally the sad news
today for samsung you have to do with
the aftermath of the galaxy note 7 the
company's sales and profits are down a
staggering amount just 87 million
dollars which is the worst the company
has done in eight years and eight years
i think was even before the galaxy s
that far away back when smartphones
weren't really that popular in samsung
wasn't really competing as hard as it is
now that's bad news apparently the
company sales are down eight percent and
it's all over all hitting the company's
bottom line at around thirty percent of
income this is terrible for the company
hopefully welp Samsung figures out a way
to fix its way back but it leads me to
the question of the day what would you
recommend that Samsung due to its future
products for there to be you know more
credibility in the company in my case
samsung figure out a way to innovate
with replaceable batteries you know just
figure it out you've done it in the past
I'm sure you could do it now leave us a
