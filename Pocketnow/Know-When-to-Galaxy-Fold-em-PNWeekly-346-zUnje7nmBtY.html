he's been editing that video for the
last couple of hours that song is so
stuck in our heads oh you're not gonna
put this in the video it's karaoke time
hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly recorded in Barcelona Spain
that's right we are here in Barcelona
for Mobile World Congress and this
episode has been recorded on February
22nd 2019
now we're hot off the heels of Samsung's
unpacked event which happened in San
Francisco and on this episode I made of
Etta and myself are going to talk
unpacked the crazy and cool galaxy fold
and the new Galaxy S 10 line obviously
you can see I'm using the galaxy s 10
plus and hi Mae has his own we are going
to be doing those reviews very soon
there is a quick note that I want to
give all of you I will be repeating this
a couple of times during the episode
this is a new format that we're trying
out for the podcast instead of a bunch
of different topics we're going to hone
in on one at the most maybe two or three
different topics perhaps all related
where we can talk at length about them
for about 45 minutes we want to know
what you think about this kind of format
as we have been kind of shifting to it
over the last number of episodes and you
can let us know your thoughts using the
hashtag P and weekly on Twitter and of
course if you're watching the YouTube
version of the podcast you can let us
know what you think in the comment
sections down below alright well with
all that said let's unpack everything
that Samsung threw in our faces this
past week
all right Samsung unpacked
I would actually venture oh yeah my
phone's over there but that's okay I
would actually venture to say that it's
okay I mean it's it's only gonna end up
being a distraction because I like it so
much well we'll get to that in a little
bit Samsung unpacked is it a stretch for
me to say that this might have been the
most enjoyable unpacked that we've ever
been to
oh I loved it I've been granted I'm I'm
in a different place in my life compared
to every other unpacked I've ever been
to I like this one a lot
this one was this one there's a very
good time I think my favorite unpack was
the Galaxy Note 7 note 7 okay so Galaxy
Note 7 and then the s8 were for me the
best unpacks mmm-hmm for me the note 7
because where's that one for the
stupidest thing it happened in the
there's this place close to Penn Station
I forget what the name of that place is
right in between B and H and Penn
Station okay I forget the name of that
place
Madison Square Garden no no it's another
building I the link it's not the Lincoln
Center that was for the s8 okay the
reason why I like that one was the
choreography that that the guys that
were gonna do the hands-on with us the
choreography that they did to set up the
tables for the beginning of the hands-on
was epic I also remember the Lincoln
Center that was a great venue I was a
fantastic venue actually yeah and so so
for me the note 7 was because of you
know we had just come out sorry that
wasn't the note 7 that was actually the
note 8 and so we had just come out of
the Proms of the note 7 and so you know
DJ Koch comes onstage apologizes and
apologizes in such a heartfelt manner
they also had that video packet yes yes
I love that I love that how genuine that
was yes and so that plus the
choreography that so I was talking to
the people who did the heads on it they
were like dude we've been tested we
would try to do this for a week we never
got it right until today nice that was
the first one and then the second one
was the SAT because of the Lincoln
Center the hands-on was fantastic we had
perfect lighting that wasn't really it's
I think it's the only time we've ever
had good hands-on videos or events
because we were able to actually yeah
cuz you we there was that huge window
with all the natural light coming in
yeah and then we were able to go outside
for spiels and all that stuff yeah but
then but then and then if you remember
it you know the people the guys that
were holding the phones for our hands-on
they started at the front and then they
all raised their phones and then they
started walking out uh and for us to
follow them that was really cool that
was that was really cool but I would
give this one a close third okay for how
they introduced the galaxy fold that's
exactly what how how you dim the lights
there's no ladies and gentlemen there's
no nothing it's just they got right into
with oh my god that was so cool there
was a certain stride that I felt like
all the presenters and everybody had
during the show where they knew that
they were they were hitting just this
great new moment in tech yeah and yes
with the galaxy fold but also there was
this level of confidence on stage about
the s10 line and I just feel like yeah I
was just sitting there
I was engrossed yeah because I was
actually excited about everything that
they had they figured everything was
great up until the moment and I have
that recorded on video if you need it
for this uh-huh the moment were was like
it's $1,980 the reaction of people was
like and then they power through it no
no he tried to power through it and
people started laughing oh yeah yeah
people started laughing that reaction
was hilarious my ig story of that
particular shot just has the word Oh so
let's talk about the Galaxy fold then
one last thing I wanted to mention
though is that um not to not to get into
the weeds with this particular piece of
info but I kind of weeds I had a bit of
a situation where I wasn't sure if I was
going to get a review Union I had to
sort of like sleuth around to figure out
what was going on and in that amount of
time I actually had to do my videos
old-school style
but I loved that man did great okay here
I felt like the first few years of my
career where you're on a show floor and
you have to do all of this content in
one spot with potentially terrible
lighting very bad conditions not
potentially of course it's terrible
lighting and you're you thought was
right that one was way better than most
stuff yeah and but you forget about
things like it's one of the main reasons
why we shifted away from doing that
because we always forgot this or forgot
that and people complain in the comments
and it's not intentionally just got a
limited time you've got stories of
people just pushing you around as you're
trying to film like the video gets all
wonky and everything that's the reason I
stopped using monopod for events just
because people are pushing you around
yeah and when you least expect that boom
your cameras on the floor yeah I'm very
close to my equipment and I'm I haven't
I'm I'm really babying everything I
actually learned from Hayato strapped
the camera to your belt
Oh tress draft the monopod that strap
that comes with it yeah
strap it to your belt okay that's what
to do okay well just kudos to Samsung
for such a great experience zone so I
was able to do my video there and then I
ended up getting my hands on review you
know later thank goodness and kudos to
to you guys but we
did our unboxing so you could watch that
here on the channel as well that was a
good one
but before we get into the s10 obviously
we got to talk about the Galaxy fold
let's do it my goodness um I want to
flashback to the Samsung experience
conference or the Developers Conference
when they first showed off a fold I
didn't even see that
I saw the Justin clip where he shows it
off and it's just all darkened and
everything it doesn't look the final
product does not look like what they
showed their Ortiz they know I was
expecting it to be thicker I was
expecting it to look like a D s like a
real D s agreed um my what what was
presented there even without the Willy
Wonka song was spectacular like I'm
super excited for it because for once
we're not just looking at a screen that
bends and we're like oh you can get a
tablet size there's actual thought put
into this phone I'm super excited but
for the wrong reasons the problem is
we're most likely gonna get a review
unit so it's not like if I'll have to
cough money for it do you think they're
going to be very stringent with it
they'll give you most likely will though
they'll just make it a loaner yet to
return
that's Rachel hey that's $2,000 that
they could potentially lose like 30
times over
it's just that okay so the problem is
and that's why it's all the wrong
reasons I feel that we're not we have to
we have to definitely serve empathy with
our with our viewers yeah in our
listeners in the fact that come on man
okay I like if if I didn't do what I do
if I didn't do what I do
I'd be like $2,000 like that I was in
Don's and on the Don Esposito's video
where we were talking about all the
things you could buy for $2,000 hmm and
I actually recorded a clip that I was
gonna fit into the unboxing that we did
4,000 tacos by the way four thousand it
depends on where man Chelsea markets you
know oh the metric for that is always
jackin the-box
oh your your levels are way low it's
just a joke we always use the same back
in college man that's fine five bucks
you're going to spend five but you could
get ten tacos for that anyways sorry go
ahead but the thing about it was um oh
my god you could buy a not the most
powerful but obviously a well spec
MacBook
for that yeah totally you can buy a one
terabyte iPad pro with like absolutely
everything you could think of which I
wouldn't recommend but like the MacBook
Pro I even made the analogy I'm like
okay so you remember when the first
iPhone was announced where Steve Jobs
makes the analogy a phone will cost you
this plus a plan
an iPod will cost you this and so we're
just gonna sell it at that premium
because back then people don't remember
that the most storage you could get was
like 128 megabytes yes and then you had
to buy an SD card that at most would go
to one gigabyte and that one gigabyte
card so that's one thing that Steve Jobs
didn't mention if you wanted a 1
gigabyte card in 2007 it was $100 yeah
but way high for storage exactly uh
sacked then and so think about it you
got a 4 gigabyte iPhone in an 8 gigabyte
iPhone and so it for me the iPhone at
500 bucks plus a plan made sense because
of the gigabytes because of the storage
what justifies this product at that
price and people are like it's new
technology I'm like come on man flexible
OLED zuv existed for what five six years
but not ones that had that you're
actually willingly folding and moving I
totally agree with that fine I get that
it's new technology I love and abang it
to his video please watch his I hope
it's already live yeah he filmed the
full video where he's like stop
complaining it's it's this is this is
new technologies emerging you're gonna
be a first adopters or ironically the
ones who pay the most but you know it's
funny he's not gonna fight it either
like dude would you buy it is the
question okay would you choose a Galaxy
S 10 and an iPad pro over that I would
only get the galaxy okay if I if I
needed to spend my hard-earned money I
would I will get an s10 I stem plus in
but today I will get an s10 plus and
wait to see what everybody else says
about the galaxy fold and if I I I would
definitely have friends you know what if
the reviews are good if the reviews are
good I have to try it still I need to
have a friend who has it and I'm going
to borrow it from them and I'm gonna use
it for a little bit cuz that's the thing
it's been a long time since I've
actually had to worry about buying tech
but in this case I'm putting myself in
those shoes I'm not gonna buy it unless
I
actually spend time with it can't be a
fresh $2,000 down the drain this is how
I felt with the iPhone tennis max
because when I started my own channel
and working with you guys
I well I had to buy that phone myself I
felt very crappy spending all of that
money on a phone all at once especially
for an iPhone tennis max which I
actually was not super excited to get
right right you know no I I don't know
for me the problem is is and we were
talking with Donal I mean you could get
a one plus 64 for $4.99 you can get an
iPad the standard iPad because this is
this the this galaxy fold is not even
stylus capable it's not even a Galaxy
Note to a certain degree and so that is
a missed opportunity that is a totally
missed opportunity which makes me wonder
I was we were landing today and I was
wondering what's gonna happen with the
note going forward yeah because okay and
the reason why I thought about that is
because if you look at the galaxy s 10
plus it looks like the note they the
corners are sharper a lot of them like
this looks exactly like the note that
comparisons gonna be funny and then I'm
like huh could this be telling us
something could this be telling us that
the note is gonna change it's due for a
change you know I still think they
should make a way cuz now that you can
buy a spends separately that there
should be cost compatibility yeah
because it does feel like the one thing
missing from this phone I totally agree
but so we were like okay so you could
buy a standard iPad for 400 bucks you
can buy you know you can buy the one
plus 60 why that's a thousand bucks
right there why would you pay twice that
amount and then you know for me there
are certain concerns like don't get me
wrong I saw the video and I it was until
the moment that I sign it's not but come
with me thing it was it was that was the
presentation plus the hands-on of the
very Josh to the Josh guy Josh oh man
how happy tech free Santosh we feel we
feel so bad for you dude we could see
you tremble in that demo but we get it
now we go through that stuff to work I
was like wall through the demo like he
was very nervous but he killed it too
he killed it but it's not until you see
the demo
you start doing something in the
external display and then you open like
I'm like okay I really like this like I
really like the idea it's still not
something I made its still a solution
exactly yes but tell me visually like
aesthetically it looks really really
nice yes it's not just a phone it's not
just a device made for the sake of the
form-factor it still has Samsung DNA
yeah it's very much a Samsung looking
device through and through well it but I
have to tell you I have to say probably
the one reason why I'm not totally
stoked to spend the money on it is
because in the main orientation that I
would use it all the time it has a lower
quality display that's the other thing
okay so there are there are a few
caveats to going for this product
obviously one is the curse of the early
adopter it's the one reason why I would
never buy this product out of my money
the curse of the early adopter the
second one would be the form factor this
is the return of holsters you're not
gonna put that thing in your pocket I
would you're not
come on man I would stubbornly put it in
these skinny jeans I'm wearing right now
and would you use it in a specific angle
with a purpose or what I mean it's I I
would be stubborn enough I'm not gonna
bust out the LD west even though even
though Fisher has given me one I do have
one are you serious yeah yes oh my god
Michael Fisher if you're watching this
where's that new light pole replacement
thing that he's wearing there's like
yeah strap for his leg I'm like this has
to be Michael like I hadn't see his face
I just walk into a room and I see a guy
with a pair of jeans and with that thing
strapped on his leg and I'm like this is
asked to be Fisher think of like a knife
holster on your thigh but it's for other
stuff it's a toolbox yes wow it's really
a pouch it's like where's your drill man
where's the screwdriver I would be
stubborn enough to still use the galaxy
phone no matter what pants I'm using no
matter what pockets I have I'm granted
we are in the era where men are allowed
to have like small sling bags now but
the the thing is I just in the one way
that I would have to use it most of the
time I'm not gonna be happy with that
that is the third problem yeah the third
caveat is why is that external screen so
small I mean
that's the one place where I felt they
had what I mean why are we I'm not gonna
unfold that thing every time I need to
do so no I'm just not no and then I'm
trying to understand like that hole cut
out that they did for the cameras on the
old one display yeah when it's open
I'm like really unless you can sort of
like fold it in a little so I can stand
because they didn't show that cuz does
the can the fold go at an a at a degree
night there are so many questions about
sag that way we don't know like one
thing a lot is so certain insiders
so apparently certain publications were
able to see this product yeah because I
was actually walking out so I filmed the
daily from I filmed the daily from from
the from the venue and so as I'm
strapping things up there's a specific
first that I'm not gonna mention it was
on the phone was probably with his
editor and he was saying yeah they just
showed it off apparently it seems that
you can't fully open it like there's a
certain curve to it it's there's a
certain curve to it ah so it becomes a G
flex sort I my VIP my video just sort of
expounding upon the ideas behind the
galaxy fold it's not new bananaphone
it's not out it's my video where I sort
of speculate on the phone is not out yet
but I will
I'll do a quick spoiler alert if you're
gonna go to my channel watch it there is
one user I'm that I'm that user who
can't wait to use this phone for gaming
I'm super excited for the how how are
you gonna play with that you launched it
you launched it on the dumb display then
you open it up and you got like a big
old thing to play a game on that
actually makes me really excited that's
the only application that I think super
excites me about that but I have
everything else it's gonna be it's it's
it's gonna be an adjustment period that
I think most users will not be able to
fathom let alone spend $2,000 to still
have a learning curve dude I mean
obviously there there are people that
spend $17,000 or an apple on an Apple
watch edition the gold one the first one
so
I you know I'm not gonna say that
Samsung is going stupid with the price
now Apple wins that one I'd still think
that you're right and I'd still think
that the price makes sense for what it's
trying to do but or and not but and I
don't it's still ridiculous for most
users I don't I listen the moment they
said luxury smartphone of their everyone
was like you know what that means so we
have a subpar display on the back yeah
we've got a really good flexible display
on the front that on the inside it has a
sound on the inside add six cameras um
two batteries twelve gigabytes of RAM
triple multitasking like now here's the
question and scratch myself here's the
question I want to ask you do you
actually do duo multis asking right now
is the question like even an answer for
YouTube you know it's I'm not saying
it's a bad thing like every now and then
I'll be navigating from point A to point
B and I want my map to be at the front
and to see something at the bottom yes
but it's not like like these are all
cool things to do that the average
person will never go back to that's the
problem okay yeah I think I think the
pertinent question here is obviously
listeners and viewers are you going to
use this phone to as greatest potential
and I guess my my preface to that is do
you even use tablets in general I think
it's the tablet user that can see the
benefit of this dude and in so here's
the thing I find myself always carrying
an iPad pro but the reasons why I use it
again in my review is very clear they're
not conventional I've fallen in love
with adobe spark and I use it every day
for our thumbnails I've fallen in love
with OneNote and I use the Apple pencil
i sub utilize the Apple pencil into
making it my highlighter but I could use
a galaxy note for that I could use it
galaxy tab as for for that I can as any
other one like it doesn't have to be an
iPad pro um but then other than that
dude aside from day one which is my
journaling app I don't really use day
one it's fantastic okay yeah I've heard
of that and I've thought about using I'm
not saying it's worth every penny
because it's like $50 to the computer
I'm like oh no way I am like galaxy fu
no but but you know it's it's AI tablets
oh and the other thing as you noticed
yesterday I use it as my speaker yes my
portable speaker because the speakers
are freaking awesome but then other than
that it's like it's not a product you
need do you need a SmartWatch note do
you need do you need a tablet no and I
think that that is the biggest problem
as for the selling point of this that I
think is so the biggest problem for the
selling point of this device is that the
fact that you don't need a tablet the
fact that it's not something that you
actually that will actually solve
anything for you there's nothing this is
literally like what's what's uh what's a
car brand that you would see as like you
never need it but it's a status a
Porsche okay Porsche I was thinking
Lambo no but but if you think about it
like in the case of the yeah a Lambo or
whatever of these brands or this is this
this might actually be the Bugatti
Veyron
now don't get me wrong we've seen
virtues cost the loss a lot more than
this empanada business now for a reason
so so here's the problem it's like
you're telling me that you're creating a
foldable product to give me a tablet
when the TAT when people don't really
use tablets don't use tablets and it
doesn't really matter if you some for 50
dollars like Amazon or for 200 bucks
like Amazon or for 399 like Apple it
doesn't matter people don't buy them
yeah you know and you usually what do
people do they buy cheap tablets for
their kids hmm for them to play oh don't
give this phone to your kids that's the
thing so I was like okay so one thing
there one very interesting thing
happened with the launch of the galaxy s
10 and it's not that I'm trying to segue
it's just probably what I like the most
about the s10 is the price tag yes we're
gonna get into that a lot we're gonna
get into that a lot but it's like they
slapped Apple it's like we're not
selling anything at your price yeah and
our plus variant is the same price of
your smaller and 10s that that's great
yeah I got the tennis max but if we
iterate I was not happy to
but if they would have been like okay
it's $12.99 for the Galaxy f12 love for
the F so I guess those are all the leaks
those are all the leaks and I go to them
every day sorry but yeah think about it
$12.99 I mean it's the oh it's the or
the price of the tennis max mm-hmm if it
was that price if they would have priced
it at the same level of the tennis max
that would have like immediately the
like that would have been like here
Apple but that's that's gonna be second
gen this is gonna this is the
proof-of-concept high high price low low
sales but the high price makes it fun to
the next generation okay you know what
the funny part is dear Samsung feel free
to use this video just like you use
philosophy Carter's videos use this at
the next unpacked and quotas over as the
coat me as the naysayer who thinks that
this product is a you know is a solution
in search of a problem
and then next year they're gonna pull a
galaxy know like we I was like what's
the Galaxy Note 4 and now I can't live
without that damn thing that's true
that is true um that being said I'm
really looking forward to what the notes
gonna bring o
I because looking forward to the note
now more than ever exactly because of
everything that we've seen at unpacked
not only what the galaxy fold but with
these phones this one there you have in
your hand right now and mines over there
this is the galaxy s ten plus so it made
sense obviously that out of three
different phones the review units that
we would get would be the ones yeah most
things yeah so yes we have been using
the galaxy s 10 plus ever since we both
have been on planes we're actually in
Barcelona right now getting ready for
Mobile World Congress we have spent
plane rides with this so far which is
why which is a good use case scenario
but that being said general thoughts on
the phone so far before we get into the
general thoughts about the line itself I
just like the fact that it feels like
the note 9 it really does it's like if
you're carrying a note 9 a little
lighter though a little lighter I love
the color
I the screen is great
I obviously it's it's it's an even
better it's an even better Roland um
I've been playing with the camera a lot
I I need to do more I've been more using
the screen more because I downloaded a
buttload of anime for my flight so I've
just been watching it and a lot of
YouTube so the viewing experience has
been amazing the cameras I'm looking
forward to use okay so so my initial
impressions are photography is
surprisingly better than I expected
question-there front facing camera
recently got a really good score in DX
Oh mark no okay okay so go to my
Instagram there's a photo of me holding
this phone um holding this phone and
that photo initially was just like Josh
let me rs10 I'll take a selfie with your
s10 of me holding my attend ya know the
D are completely blown out behind me I
tried every single setting completely
blown out arm then I pulled out the
iPhone 10's snap perfect shot
yeah and I'm and I would I'm willing to
bet that the pixel three would be the
same I and I had the pixel three right
there damn I didn't think of that
okay but but did you get the email so we
just got an email they're asking us to
hold our but there's no embargo which is
great like we could pull reviews
whenever we want um but we got asked to
take our times because during this
weekend we should be getting an update
to fix it then of things okay fair
enough yeah question there
am i correct my my memory does the
front-facing camera have no post
processing the way that the pixel of the
iPhones do it doesn't have multi frame
process I haven't gone that far I don't
think they've ever put it in the
front-facing camera no I don't think so
because he's right the dynamic range on
the front-facing camera does need work
it doesn't need tuning it does need to
know that said when you know as far as
the subject is in focus
the details are fine oh so if there's
nothing like if you're not shooting with
like a white or
you know like what he's like a lip
background what he looks like right now
this is called dynamic range that yeah
that you know and and so it's it's now
but it's very hard for cameras to get it
right of course and I and I'll tell you
this much like it doesn't matter what
professional camera you have it's very
difficult think about it is that's when
you get pixels and iPhone tennis the the
iPhone 10s the iPhone 10 was trash but
the iPhone 10s like they really really
tweaked that yeah they really learned
how to because that's the thing smart
phones the laws of physics don't allow
then simply don't allow for amazing dr
dynamic range on that tiny little sensor
it's very dense which is why multiframe
processing which is why pros
post-processing has become computational
photography there go that which is why
it has become so more so I'm I'm not
giving the phone a pass I don't I don't
like the dr on the front definitely not
I love the 4k on the front even if the
DRS bad at least again sales are high
yes but try to remember what doesn't
work in 4k I tried I tried still
stabilization it's not the steady shot
it's not it's not the same still steady
shot doesn't work regardless on the
front camera yeah exactly but it had but
there is a stabilization okay and as I
was telling you when we were coming in
the cab
one thing that super stable mode
actually is working on the wide-angle
for me that was surprising but I need to
see that certainly happening okay so
viewers and listen well listeners you
won't be able to see this well we'll
figure out a way to show you but see if
you move into into video and you remove
the the super civilization you crop in
oh you crop in and then when you enable
stabilization the super steady mode you
crop out oh so it's using the wide-angle
and most likely what it's doing because
it's 16 mega play 16 megapixels right on
the wide yes yeah on the white it's
probably cropping from that and playing
some crazy amount it's like a GoPro
that's it's using the same strategy as
the GoPro it's just it's smart exactly
it's pretty smart I'm not gonna lie and
as long as the quality is still high you
got your stabilization yeah and this
pretty much means that there
no reason why the s10 he doesn't have
that well because it has a white angle
yeah yeah well and we don't know we I
didn't play enough with the s10 II to
know but that means that like I should
have it should have it should have it it
should have it and I'm not gonna lie the
s10 II wasn't my favorite I I would I
was I was hoping that they gave me a
choice to pick one but now well let's
let's talk a little bit more about that
white angle there there are a bunch of
lenses on the back here you get
telephoto you get ultra wide you get the
regular sensor and you I remember when
you became a believer in the white angle
on I want to say I forget what your
phone it was I think was the g6 there's
the g6 right did you say we were here in
Barcelona yeah and you were trying to
get a picture in one of the many
alleyways where there's not a lot of
space yeah and you got it using that
white angle yeah that's when you became
a believer I remember you were talking
about that now we have it on so many
other phones and it's now on a Samsung
which it's just so exciting
yeah because LG we love you you were
pioneer come on you guys have to step it
up because everybody else Huawei Samsung
probably next year who knows Apple might
put one on their phone too what's gonna
happen at that point this wide-angle
craziness is gonna be part of 2019 but
you know I think that LG has been doing
it right the problem is they're just in
photography it's like it's so g4 I am
hoping that they do something with the
g8 I doubted given the rumors and the
leaks um but that's really the problem
with LG I mean they wish they were
stubborn and not adopting larger of
microns on their on their sensors and
their post profit like I think LG was
the company that invented
post-processing yeah I think so I would
I would say that LG was yeah cuz when
they were the first company where we
noticed it because there was a g-force
oh yeah the over sharpening and no
aggressive noise reduction so the g3 was
the one that was like terrible
aggressive noise reduction and over
sharpening and then they came out with
the g4 and it's like wow like beautiful
dynamic range changed great color but we
knew that it was a subpar sensor that's
the first time that we saw a subpar
hardware being well tweaked by
software yeah the prob the problem is
that for when was the G for 2014 I think
so so five years ago it made a lot of
sense it's just can we please move away
from 2014 is there 14 2015 something
like that yes obviously every other
company picked up on it and took it
forward yeah
% well I mean across the board here
we're very happy that the wide angle is
there and like we like like I made just
mentioned it is also on the s10 II which
is actually the lowest tier of the s10
line still has a wide ankle yeah thank
God someone's finally realizing
telephone is not that useful I use it a
lot I do love telephoto for I love
street photography okay
I love street photography and for me
it's like right now that I've been
playing with that wide-angle lens on the
on the g h5 i do miss the the i do miss
the very height the tightness of a
telephoto of a long lens not now sorry
not of a long lens but just the less you
know of a 15 millimeter of a 20
millimeter yeah it's just there are
certain times when you're on the street
where that becomes so convenient you
don't have to zoom into anything you
know you have the advantage that your
aperture is fixed and so I don't know
and I honestly believe that for most
people out there
telephoto was just a means to an end to
get good portrait modes which wasn't
good well yeah which wasn't even perfect
which was I think most people out there
will adopt the wide-angle at a faster
rate than they ever did well in LG
proved that you could do a portrait shot
with a wide-angle yeah they did it with
the g7 and so you know if you're gonna
just process the photo to get that
effect anyway just use the ones in to a
certain degree I think that LG did the
better job oh really I you know I love
that the the portrait shots from the g7
they look the most natural hmmm okay I
still remember the ones that the Google
phones used to do where you had to like
lens blur that was like to do that
little movement just to get that blur of
the background that was natural anyway
but yeah why didn't go all across the
board so let's talk about the other
phones as well we have the s10 plus
that's what we're testing and that's
where our reviews will be coming from
and yeah whatever comparisons and
whatnot we're gonna have a lot of
compare since
my Azam still have a regular s10 and in
in my speculation video of regarding
that phone I said that it would be the
phone for most users be s10 yes you
think I think so because they're gonna
be a lot of discerning users out there
who don't know if they want to spend the
extra hundred dollars on a bigger screen
and a bigger battery which is really all
the as 10 plus provides but the size
difference is it's not that big to be
fully honest with you I don't understand
why the s10 exists I think it I don't
think it's for those core users I mean
it's like I would I would have rather
the s10 II would be the s10 and then
just the s10 plus I don't understand the
purpose of the s10 I mean like the
differences are so meager in between
either that I think that that's the
phone that's gonna flop out of all three
people are either gonna go for the
larger one because you either want it
for bragging rights for you wanted for
convenience and you go for the s10 II
and because Samsung's philosophy with
these phones is that it doesn't matter
which one you pick you're supposed to
get the same amount of battery life
you're supposed to get the same quality
display and it's just a few minor things
that are not being provided with the s10
II there's a huge dip in battery between
yeah same size in size yes but it's a
full HD Plus display no not on the not
on the regular as on the on the yeah on
the he on the it's it's full HD and so
according to Samsung and they would like
I even asked twice during the briefing
you're telling me that if you're
offering me 10 hours on one I'll get 10
hours on all three they're like yes the
battery size differences are only to
compensate for being able to achieve
that amount of time given the hardware I
don't know I just think okay here's
here's here's here's even further
speculation this is not something that
can ever be confirmed until it actually
happens the s10 Yi is the phone that
will get discounted faster than the
other two so three months from now the
SNT is gonna be $600 while the s10 and
the s10 plus remaining you think about
it man I mean you have to you'd get a
cheap it's not crappy but you'd get it
you get a ya IPS LCD at 780 P on an
iPhone 10 R yeah like literally this
this Galaxy S 10 is out to compete
against the 10r
yeah it's the same price as the 10r
which is what I'm saying that's the
reason why I still exists is because
that fills that gap while the s10 a is
the one that's gonna get a lower price
faster than the other two yeah so I
think four to six months from now when
the está knee is $500 get it I think
it's Jo I yeah just get it I don't it
like again I for me my favorite was the
SME it feels the vest and if I get the
same experience as in the case of the
s10 plus than why and that's the reason
I'm like why does the galaxy s10 exist
like I was at the hands-on sorry I was
at the briefing and honestly I I was
scrolling through my footage just to be
able to put the hands on together and
I'm like crap I didn't record anything
for the s10 because I you just forget it
like you forget that it exists I hate
that you brought that up because when I
went to the experience zone and then I
went to edit my video at the same
problem exactly so see that's the
problem it's either you want the
bragging rights of one or the
convenience of the other but the one in
the middle for just 100 bucks more yeah
I mean for just a hundred bucks more
compare that to the iPhone 10 into the
tenant at the tennis and the tennis max
where the differences are actually a
little more drastic but so is the actual
price yeah so I mean the ratio or rather
relative to his competition it provides
you a little bit more without asking for
too much and then thank God for that and
then you've got the case where this
galaxy SN plus is priced at the same
price as the 10s yeah so that's the
thing it does and that's what we mean by
it's a competitive price
a lot of the view oh yeah I saw the
comments yeah and it's true I'm not I'm
not justifying $1,000 for anything yeah
I'm just saying that I would rather like
I would rather pay for this than pay for
the iPhone 10s for the same thousand
with all 10s max for that matter oh
sorry I'm gonna bellyache about that
forever but see nice they don't have to
buy this is the perfect reaction this is
the perfect reaction because you Lee you
and I live in a bubble we don't buy our
phones but then in your case you did go
out and buy that phone and it was like
damn it I was on vacation when I bought
that phone too I was like don't want my
money like in two different way anyway
one final thought before we wrap up in
the next five or so
by the way this is sort of a this is a
format that we're trying out where we
only talk about one key topic at length
so something a little bit more focused
you might have noticed viewers and
listeners that we have been sort of
bringing down the number of topics every
single week and we're trying to get it
down to as minimal as possible with the
maximum amount of content still so about
a 45 minute podcasts what we're kind of
looking for here let us know what you
think on Twitter hash tag PN weekly and
also in the comments on the YouTube
video okay
you had never tried up until this point
Samsung wine no thoughts on that's what
I wanted it feels the same it feels the
same
ie it's it's different eigen iconography
I so I was expecting that more of the
controls would be at the bottom is the
promise of one hand that use did there
are still apps that have their controls
at the top oh wow I mean that's Android
yeah that's Android well no no but I
mean come on if you're gonna throw this
skin on top but you know what's what's
the purpose if allowed to serve that
purpose
I honestly visually I so I I do love the
dark mode I actually like that you could
sit on that you can set it on by
depending on the time of day I don't
like the fact that the always-on display
is now not always on oh well so what
what are the parameters behind it
because I don't I still don't get it
yeah but I think I love how it looks I
love how it looks like I just won yes
but you set this phone on its able it
looks like everything you know which is
what I liked about the previous always
how this play was always odd like let's
the let's call it ambient display which
would be the other approach it does feel
like the software on this or even the
sensors on this phone are very jumpy
like yeah it's it's always thinking that
it's in your hand and if it's in your
hand then who cares right I'm going to
show you anything because you're gonna
turn it on anyway right right like lit
the the lift awake stuff I hate that on
any device by the way I don't I love it
on the iPhone I can't stand it because
when I pick up the phone I just want to
do I am at command I turn you on it's
the same thing yeah it's the same thing
with you asking accepting a knife to be
able to be able to put a box of product
like sorry sorry sorry mister Sparta I
have sharp nails
I actually like it and I did a couple of
tweaks when I was on the plane ride over
that I've enjoyed a lot um just like on
the 1 plus 60 which has the 1 + slate
font
there's the samsung 1 font and I feel
like a lot of people are going to miss
out on that
you should totally turn it on it makes
the entire operating system look more
unique and it makes the entire operating
system look even clean I had no idea
there was the cool boy I had no idea
yeah it varies on that for C so that
font is there and when I saw that I was
judged to that fun I was really enjoying
what everything looked like all the
setting it on right now
yes font size and stuff so if you have
the darién you go to on Samsung one I
think it looks great I think that's a
great looking fine um so that already
made it look kind of different I don't
know why that's not default yeah right
this is looking a little better and then
changing the size of the elements
because one thing I will say is Samsung
one does seem a little bit bloated it's
a little bit more cartoony the way that
original Samsung knew I was yeah
just lower the size a little bit things
will start looking a little bit more
utilitarian I just I don't notice the
difference banana previous UI I do also
think though remember how everybody
would complain about the stutters yeah
TouchWiz oh my god I haven't said that's
why TouchWiz I've not felt one no no
unless you try to open mix view accident
I actually have not hit the Bigsby
button one I have a couple of times um
but no I it's just pie and and there are
things where I'm like why Samsung like
really like example huh Bigsby home god
that's the that's know there are worse
but like this when you press the volume
buttons it gives you the indicator at
the top instead of on the side like the
pixel is doing one plus is doing it like
it's it's that's a weird part that is a
good point Samsung still suffers from
some of the old tropes you open up an
app folder and all the icons are at the
top of the screen yeah meanwhile like
you said that oneplus whether they call
it again oxygen OS yeah puts all the
icons on the bottom row so cuz that's
where you your finger
fingers drifting and so again visually
there are options for you to fully
disable animations without needing to go
to accessibility okay but I was like so
it's funny you disable animations and it
still is like if it were a fade to black
effect where you press and it's not like
wah where it's boom boom boom no so it's
it does this like sort of fade between
one and the other and I'm like so you
say you're telling me that reduce
animations means switch animation - yeah
a different type yeah I I guess the
point I was gonna make what Samsung one
is for people like us who are really
into the software of our phones and
we're very experienced with them like we
can see where the holes are we can see
where the design flaws are but I don't
know my mom my mom and dad they use
Galaxy s8 7 so try remember exactly I
can't tell anymore because they put
cases on them and they're so bulky like
but they use they use those and they
know exactly what to do in that version
of Samsung UI Samsung one's gonna
achieve that also it's easier enough for
most people to just sort of like I don't
know run around
I still think so I don't know I love
that the edge menus are there I I do
love there are certain things like the
notification shade but then other than
that I've like there are things it the
problem is I've been using the may 20
Pro and the iPhone 10's for too long and
so I'm spoiled by things like facial
recognition showing me my notifications
oh yeah like cuz I you know if anybody
that they slept feena's will know the
last thing you want is for your
notifications to be visible on your lock
screen but you don't want to fully
switch them off so what you do is on the
iPhone it's just so convenient it will
not show you it'll just show you've got
notifications but it won't show you
anything until it sees your face that
and so the only Android phone that has
that it's the mate 20 Pro okay that's
but when you do facial recognition on
there you have to tap the note the
notification icons to bring them all up
learn which one on samsung one no it
doesn't have for me it's like great oh
you have it that way so let's see see
it's showing you all my notification tu
there's a way I'll show you on mine
later let's see what you but it still
requires you
tap dammit they won't just appear once
it so long as so long as it's like I
don't want them to be hitting I'm sorry
third world problems I will go through
my settings and see cuz I don't have
that I don't have that at all show me
all right
any final thoughts that you have on
these phones I know that our reviews are
gonna be coming out sometime soon but
any like any hot takes you can give our
viewers and listeners they're all
clamoring for it the views are actually
going up on the videos right now because
people are the residual effect of
everyone realizing that the s tens were
announced they want to know some hot
takes for the people who are on the
podcast okay oh I the hot take is a
question to you
okay um as much as I love my note 9 May
24 okay mount goodbye yeah um so right
now obviously I have my reservations
over the review process of the XO mark
probably like okay so I love the phone I
love my experience so far I'm just
trying to understand why there is no 42
megapixel camera on this thing 48 4 or
48 or whatever like pretty much
everybody else is coming out with now
like I think that that is the missed
opportunity with this phone I don't know
that Samsung has because they're calling
it professional-grade cameras and oh
that's a tall order well they're saying
pro-grade because it has all the cameras
yeah that yeah but but then you've got
the XO mark pretty much giving this
phone the same scores them as the huawei
mate 20 fro yeah well I bet that
comparison I I can't wait to do that
comparison I like all right let's see
what Pro great really is you know that's
the way we do it that that comparison I
can kind of see be they're kind of
matched in that sense because it has the
same amount of features as the same
amount of focal lengths yeah I can see
that yes I do think I did get a little
disappointed knowing that this one
didn't have the 48 megapixel Sony IMX
sensors that I saw on the honor I mean
think about it
$500 phones have that like right now I
just did the vivo v15 Pro and it's got
that same sensor Oh
in China in China and then we've got the
Xiaomi me 9mm the honour of you 20
though and then then the me 9 got I'm
not saying the pic megapixels matter or
anything sampling there's a really good
job with their software it's just
alright if this is gonna be the vanguard
phone the yes it's the new galaxy that
was a missed opportunity and and I'm
trying to give Samsung the benefit of
the doubt here because they do have
specific tuning to their sensors and if
they were to move to a new 48 megapixel
Sony IMX
I wonder if just the R&amp;amp;D just wasn't
there yet they're gonna have wait for
the note you know what I mean
that's a good point yeah they just go
wait for the note or they even have the
rumors were that Samsung has their own
version of that sensor yes that's what
house yeah I heard there was gonna be an
I so so yeah but it's not like there
have there has been like an equivalent
of an ISO cell for every Sony sensor
that's been launched or at least the
most popular ones and and you can't like
I guess there is proof that they can be
just as good if you remember the s8
mm-hm you couldn't tell if you had an
ISO cell or a Sony yeah it was different
sensory they ran out of sensors in the
same way that they don't want you to be
able to tell that you have a neck
cenotes or a Qualcomm chip you know and
then you know this new XO nose is eight
nanometer yeah it's about seven seven
and there's eight yeah that spec she was
so funny no no dude I and I apologize
like our my hands-on video was not just
terrible lighting I don't think I've
ever been to a presentation that's been
more convoluted like like just trying to
understand the differences between these
three phones is one thing and then you
go to impact that you get the galaxy
Folles than the galaxy active and the
galaxies fit you know it's a lot of
stuff I'm shocked that Samsung doesn't
choose to make separate events for their
stuff it's just two unpacks I just
couldn't imagine a separate event just
for the wearables well no I mean they
would have the Galaxy S ten on its own
deserves its own its own event yes and
the oxy fold and then the Galaxy fold
the Fed that you know deserves its own
event so I don't know
I am I'm looking forward to seeing the
comparison to that Sony I am x10 so just
answer your question I I hope that the
note has something equivalent to it
because I would love to see what Samsung
can do with that but right now looking
back on the interview 20 no it's not a
phone I use every day and no it's not a
phone that I would recommend to
everybody but when you use that sensor
to its to its fullest potential it is a
joy you just use that ultra clarity AI
mode and you have super sharp photos I'm
actually trying to do something special
with that phone while here in Barcelona
so you can look forward to that
speaking of which we're gonna go ahead
and get into Barcelona after this
podcast it's time for all of the stuff
that's gonna happen at Mobile World
Congress so you know give we'd we
apologize in advance for Sunday oh
that's right oh my god there's so many
videos are scheduled to go out on Sunday
it's crazy it's gonna be crazy it's
gonna be crazy but uh spoiler alert I
saw a lot of cool stuff Oh fair that
that week in New York was worth it there
there's one product in particular that I
did you know that my colleagues are like
you actually like that thing and I'm
like I think that that's like the
hottest thing so probably the only thing
that's standing in between me to love
this thing is that particular product
that video doesn't go live until until
Monday okay you're gonna tell me what
that is well I'll tell you what you get
off camera speaking of getting off
camera we're gonna go ahead and go into
our outro Oh before I do that again make
sure you let us know how you feel about
this particular format where we just
keep it very focused on one maybe two at
the most three topics and we went a
little bit over 45 minutes but that's
about how long we would want this to be
anyway so let us know what you think
about this format on Twitter hashtag P

the YouTube channel we apologize for our
faces and just my demeanor right now I
am so tired

moving around all this time just to just
