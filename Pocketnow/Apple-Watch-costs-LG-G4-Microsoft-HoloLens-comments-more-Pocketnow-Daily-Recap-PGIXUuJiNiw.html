instead of asking for jokes why don't
you just invite me to a beer I comments
won't ever feature in the pocket now
weekly and why don't you just give us a
comment and not complain Jaime your ears
are so big and why does this sound like
Little Red Riding Hood that's right it's
that time of the week I am high memory
that up this is pocket now and this is
the pocket now daily recap for last week
so on Monday ask you what do you think
tablets her on decline is apple core
results were in the company sold the
record-breaking I phone number as always
but tablet numbers have been on decline
four quarters already we have 838
comments out of which I'll be says I
think tablet sales are declining because
people don't want a new tablet every
year but they do with phones it strained
it no it's not strange obviously it's
not necessarily cheaper for you to buy a
phone but yeah it is more appealing for
you to want to buy something you carry
with you every day not the same case
with tablets Larry griffin says all
ipads are the same they're just thinner
faster and have touch ID but that's
really no reason to upgrade from the
ipad air to the ipad air 2 you can
really keep the same ipad for about
three to four years without missing
anything my ipad mini still works fine
and yeah that's the case for many people
really this is the ipad air one I don't
feel a need to upgrade to the ipad air 2
I would rather wait for a substantial
upgrade and I think that that's the
reason why people are doing the same
they're seeing tablets as computers and
well that's the reason why they're
upgrading them so late another commoner
says why buy a tablet that runs the same
OS as your phone everything tablet can
do phones can do except that you're
doing it on larger screen windows
tablets are the way to go and know when
those tablets have sadly not been the
way to go for a decade but I do get your
point yeah an OS that does the same on
the phone in the tablet has really
little benefit that on Tuesday ask you
what do you think about the LG g4 the
company had just made it official and
horror view so far are very positive we
have 177 comments out of which one of
them says the leather background the G
floor is beautiful and I do agree with
you it's gorgeous but watch Michael
Fisher's review it seems that it's not
as
a resilient as we want it to be brendan
says no front-facing speakers almost got
the phone perfect LG and yes I made the
comment on the daily that I found it to
be the best phone of the year but you're
right there are things that could have
been done better then kevin says after
many years of using samsung i seriously
consider the LG g4 replaceable battery
microsd all things that samsung doesn't
have anymore and look at that leather
back so beautiful and yes I think that's
the reason why would rather get a Jeep
war then a galaxy s6 you get a better
camera or a camera that's just as good
as the galaxy s6 I could say but you get
all the expendable everything that
Samsung doesn't offer unless you pay for
it then on Wednesday ask you if you
would rather buy a tech heuer Android
wear SmartWatch or the Apple watch as
the company CEO just came on record to
claim that will apparently cost 1400
dollars for its Android we're offering
we have 612 comments out of which bill
says time it tag heuer is pronounced tag
heuer not heuer and yes i would
absolutely opt for a tag in fact there
are many wristwatches I would much
rather buy them the Apple watch and yes
thank you for the correction i got like
a million comments on that and yeah I
don't get it all the time right but I
really appreciate your feedback and yeah
i would rather agree with you i'm not a
fan of Android wear per se but i do love
the way the Moto 360 looks and I would
rather do the same for the Tag Heuer
instead of the Apple watch and Dane says
Technos watch design i'll stick with
them and i had a lot of people in the
comments said the same they would rather
go for a company that really builds
watches and would rather make an
experience around that which is the main
reason why you would buy watch in the
past and not really a company that tries
to sell you software on a watch and
Rosie says tech Hoyer indisputable the
brand itself reputable watch
manufacturer and lasting 40 hours and
yeah that was one of the biggest news
that the watch's battery was gonna last
40 hours which is better than most that
smart watches the market right now we'd
love to see that then on Thursday I
asked you if you feel the Apple watch is
a rip off as tear downs revealed that it
costs eighty three point seventy seven
dollars to build one holy obviously no
marketing included we have 760 comments
out of which read content says Apple
ripping off their custom
never perfect comment and John he don't
says so does that mean that Android wear
would cost five dollars to manufacture
because it's pretty disappointing
especially in the software division and
sick burn dude but you're kind of right
Javon says I think all Apple products
are ripoffs since you get a smartphone
which specs which are better and
future-proof around the same price tag
yes you do the fact that those
specifications don't make those products
perform any better than the iphone makes
you wonder if there is a software
problem or of apple's doing something
right so I guess that Apple is actually
taking advantage of the fact that other
manufacturers are not doing a better job
and that's something to say and finally
on Friday I ask you how much would you
be willing to pay for microsoft's
hololens as the rumors are it'll cost
the more than a game console but there
was no limit to that price tag we have
158 comments out of which jonathan says
350 24 and 25 dollars I don't think you
really understand what you're getting
dude then vignesh says I would pay more
than an Apple watch but less than a max
price that's pretty much sums it up so
you're saying for nerd bucks because the
mac mini costs somewhere around there
and finally laser mobile says for what
it is a full computer 552 seven hundred
dollars depending on the specs you have
to remember that people are paying in 50
to 500 fifty dollars for an Apple watch
dude the leper watch that I would pay
for costs eleven hundred dollars or
should I say the one that I like but I
wouldn't pay for and I feel that this
product will be more oriented to gamers
so we're talking about the gaming
computer market that oscillates around
two thousand dollars and would I pay two
thousand dollars well I said in the
video that know that I would pay a
thousand dollars but then again if this
a computer proves to be more useful than
your average computer than why not I
just don't feel that this product is
anywhere close to replacing anything and
therefore you really wouldn't pay for it
Nvidia shield could be a good case or a
good case study or the fact that gear VR
zor virtual reality headsets are not
selling like hotcakes that's it for the
parking out daily recap thank you very
