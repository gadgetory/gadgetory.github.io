been here at MWC in covering the
Batphone and I always leave with a major
want I want that bad phone but I never
get it because it's expensive so we're
here 2013 let's use booth
another bad phone this time is the
PadFone infinity and we're taking a look
at this right now I'm Anton Michael
behind the camera and this is PocketNow
so as you might know the PadFone concept
is easy and simple there's a film which
talks into a tablet and the tablet has
no brains so it's just basically a
docking screen for the phone itself
there are a couple of differences
between this model and last year's model
which we'll cover in a hands-on video
and a comparison shortly after this but
let's talk about specifications about
the Batphone and Finity right here this
has got a 5 inch full HD screen that's
nine twenty by ten eighty and is powered
by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor
it's a quad-core processor running at
1.6 gigahertz it also has 2 gigabytes of
RAM and 32 / 64 gigabyte storage options
now if we turn it to the back there's
still a 13 megapixel camera like on last
year's model but this one has a better
aperture rating there's your light flat
flashlight and the build is made
completely out of aluminium so this will
probably be a phone which will get
scratched in a difficult way turning it
to the bottom we have a microUSB port
for your charging and a microphone this
is the main microphone at the device on
the left side we have the nano SIM door
so if you've seen this on the iPhone 5
you might know it up top we have your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack nothing
else right here the other side holds
your side firing speaker a power button
and the volume rocker for volume up and
volume down the front is obviously taken
by this huge slab of glass which makes
it look really good especially if you
see the bezel is very small and it
had the earpiece and the 2 megapixel
front firing front-facing camera plus
your sensors I'm not sure you can see
those and trying to get the light right
there are your sensors for proximity and
light obviously a sues branding on the
front and a bad film branding on the
back which is a little bit off but this
is pre-production hardware and also
pre-production software now let's jump
into the docking side of the tablet side
of things this is basically a domed
tablet it has no internals as in a
processor or memory everything you
operate on this side of things happens
on the phone once you docket it we've
got a 10.1 inch full HD display we also
have a webcam right here and it's not
that thin but it tapers towards the
edges if you can get a feel of that
turning it to the back this is plastic
so this is no longer the aluminum you'll
find here as you can see this is plastic
this feels good but we wish but it would
be the same material this is your
docking station so here you dot your
phone like this you just slide it in and
push it down and I'll just remove it so
that you can see the action itself we
have your speaker grill right here we
have the microUSB port for charging this
also holds a battery so while you are
docked and it charges your phone itself
there's nothing on the bottom going up
top there is your power button and to
your left there's another micro USB port
or maybe that's a micro HDMI port and
let's do some docking action ok so
here's a docking action you take your
phone you slide it in in this little
pocket all the way to the bottom and
then you just push down on it and
there's a haptic feedback on the tablet
going on telling you that it's been
docked so here it goes sliding it down
vibration and it automatically switches
to the tablet layout it's no longer a
phone layout even though you can have it
set so that it emulates the phone layout
of things and while we are here we might
just hop into settings real quick and
see what this platform runs it's
currently running Android 4.1.2 and of
course you have the suits skin on top of
it which some issues even though it's a
very resemblance
a standard user interface lots of Seuss
widgets like your bat phone assistant
which is scrollable with or at least it
was scrollable it is suitable with
charging settings and useful information
this is Michael Fisher's favorite widget
the power indicator for charging how
much power you have on your phone and on
your tablet so basically this is all
about the bat phone at the moment one
thing we don't have the fancy stylus
which acts as an earpiece you can talk
on the phone while it is docked and
either by by using a speakerphone or by
using a standard Bluetooth headset or
you can just pop it out and use the
phone as a phone so we'll get back to
you with a comparison between the
Padfone infinity and d-pad phone - until
then this was an item from pocket now of
course Michael behind the camera a Sue's
and pocket now at MWC 2013 thank you
very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
