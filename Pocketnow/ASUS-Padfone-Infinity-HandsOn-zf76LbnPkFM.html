been here at mwc covering the bat phone
and I always leave with a major want i
want that bad phone but i never get it
because it's expensive so we're here
2013 let's use booth another bad phone
this time is the padfone infinity and
we're taking a look at this right now
i'm anton icon behind a camera and this
is pocket now so as you might know the
bathroom concept is easy and simple
there's a film which talks into a tablet
and the tablet has no brains so it's
just basically a docking screen for the
phone itself are a couple of differences
between this model and last year's model
which we'll cover in a hands-on video
and a comparison shortly after this but
let's talk about specifications about
the padfone infinity right here this has
got a five inch full HD screen that's 9
20 x 1080 and is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 processor it's a
quad-core processor running at 1.6
gigahertz it also has two gigabytes of
RAM and 32 / 64 gigabyte storage options
now if we turn it to the back there's
still a 13 megapixel camera like on last
year's model but this one has a better
aperture rating there's your light flat
flashlight and the build is made
completely out of aluminum so this will
probably be a phone which will get
scratched in a difficult way turning it
to the bottom we have a micro USB port
for your charging and a microphone this
is the main microphone at the device on
the left side we have the nano SIM door
so if you've seen this on the iPhone 5
you might know it up top we have your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack nothing
else right here the other side holds
your side firing speaker a power button
and the volume rocker for volume up and
volume down the front is obviously taken
by this huge slab of glass which makes
it look really good especially if you
see the bezel is very small and it
have the earpiece and the 2 megapixel
front firing a front facing camera plus
your sensors are not sure you can see
those and trying to get the light right
there are your sensors for proximity and
light obviously a Sue's branding on the
front and a bad film branding on the
back which is a little bit off but this
is pre-production hardware and also pre
production software let's jump into the
docking side of the tablet side of
things this is basically a dump tablet
it has no internals as in a processor or
memory everything you operate on this
side of things happens on the phone once
you docket it we've got a 10.1 inch full
HD display we also have a webcam right
here and it's not that thin but the
tapers towards the edges if you can get
a few of that turning it to the back
this is plastic so this is no longer the
aluminum you'll find here as you can see
this is plastic and feels good but we
wish but it would be the same material
this is your docking station so here you
got your phone like this just slide it
in and push it down and I'll just remove
it so that you can see the action itself
we have your speaker grill right here we
have the micro USB port for charging
this also holds a battery so while you
are docked and it charges your phone
itself there's nothing on the bottom
going up top there is your power button
and to your left there's another micro
USB port or maybe that's a micro-hdmi
port and let's do some talking action
okay so here's a docking action you take
your phone you slide it in in this
little pocket all the way to the bottom
and then you just push down on it and
there's a haptic feedback on the tablet
going on telling you that it's been
ducked so here it goes sliding it down
vibration and it automatically switches
to the tablet layout it's no longer a
phone layout even though you can have it
set so that it emulates the phone layout
of things and while we are here we might
just hop into settings real quick and
see what this pad phone runs it's
currently running Android 4.1 point2
the of course you have the sous skin on
top of it which some issues even though
it's very resembling a standard user
interface lots of the sous widgets like
your Batphone assistant which is
scrollable with or at least it was
scrollable it is scalable with charging
settings and useful information this is
Michael Fisher's favorite widget the
power indicator for charging how much
power you have on your phone and on your
tablet so basically this is all about
the bat phone at the moment one thing we
don't have the fancy stylus which acts
as an earpiece you can talk on the phone
while it is docked in either by by using
a speakerphone or by using a standard
Bluetooth headset or you can just pop it
out and use the phone as a phone so
we'll get back to you with a comparison
between the padfone infinity and the
padfone 2 until then this was an time
from pocket now of course Michael behind
the camera a sooz and pocket now at mwc
2013 thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
