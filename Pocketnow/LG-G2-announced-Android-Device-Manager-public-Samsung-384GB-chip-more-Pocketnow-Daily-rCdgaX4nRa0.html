includes some creepy choir music the
Android device manager goes live for
your tracking pleasures and Samsung
develops a 384 gigabyte storage chip I'm
hi Mary Vanna and trust me judging by
the explicit libraries of certain people
384 gigs may not cut it this is
pocketnow daily okay so everything today
is that our product releases google has
finally unwrapped their android device
manager meaning you can track your lost
or stolen phone make it ring or wipe it
if something goes wrong it's finally
awesome to have this functionality and
android for free being offered in the
past by other third-party solutions and
it's just great to have this feature as
of now make sure you get it now
interesting Microsoft has just launched
their new bing app suite for windows
phone I know it took them so long you
get news you get sports you get stocks
which is called finances among other
things and again it fix to wonder why
did Microsoft leave this three years
later and not launch it from the
beginning still it's always great to
have new apps and new services on the
platform and speaking of other products
you know that we're just a couple of
weeks away from BBM going cross-platform
to iOS and Android and as a result
whatsapp which is pretty much the
biggest cross-platform messaging service
out there it's just announced that they
have 300 million users and they're
celebrating by offering this new voice
to voice messaging service which is
close to like push to talk they now have
this button that's dedicated for it in
the past they had sort of the same voice
recording thing but now it's a little
easier to use sadly not as good as
push-to-talk and again bbm will probably
reach the other platforms soon and it
just next to wonder I mean what
messaging service do you use what's
happens my favorite what is your
favorite and I told you keeping up with
product announcement Samsung has just
announced that they developed this new
vertical 3d NAND flash memory chip and I
think I got that whole name right the
point being is that there will be now a
limit of three hundred and eighty four
gigabytes of storage on a mobile flash
chip that's how much you thoroughly
be able to have in the next couple of
probably months or years we're not sure
how long Sam's is going to take the
deploy this but obviously it doesn't
mean that you're gonna get this now
obviously it means that the current peak
that exists is going to keep growing and
growing and hopefully phones are going
to become cheaper and cheaper as memory
becomes cheaper as well and finally for
the well you know it's hot and it's also
not so hot news of the day LG has just
announced their g2 and probably one of
the most boring events that we've ever
seen so far you thought that the whole
tap dancing thing from the galaxy s4 was
gimmicky will try choir music on your
event because that's pretty much what
you got in the event and that's what
you're gonna get in ringtones in this
phone now don't get me wrong this is a
very beautiful phone very beautifully
designed thing I mean the specs are
awesome is probably one of the most
powerful smartphones right now in the
market or when it gets launched but then
again the problem is that it's built by
LG and even though LG does make some
good hardware sadly their software
implementation is not the best so again
we're gonna test this phone it's going
to reach our pocket our labs very soon
for a review we'll keep you posted but
that leads me to the question of the day
after everything you saw today with our
hands on videos and everything linked
down below for that let me know I mean
what do you think about this g2 is this
a home that you would want in my
particular case honestly again I love
this design I love the phone but I'd
wait for our reviewers to tell us if
this phone is really worth your money
leave us a comment down below what do
you think of course as always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone intel pro be
sure you follow us on target now comment
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
it also follow me on twitter time it
underscores iveta please give this video
