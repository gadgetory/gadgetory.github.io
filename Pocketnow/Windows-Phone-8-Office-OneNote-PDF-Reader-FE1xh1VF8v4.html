packing.com I'm going to show you
something new about Windows Phone 8
let's check it out alright in this video
we're gonna take a look at the office
hub OneNote and Microsoft's new PDF
reader so let's start with the office
hub and you see a new logo and we see
recent documents we have a different
type of icon then we had for the large
tile is gone and it says how recently
you were using some of these files
there's the search you search SkyDrive
the phone or your email attachments
SharePoint as well and over here we have
the places where you might store your
documents so SkyDrive email anything
that you get an email and open it will
show up here and an open anything
and there's your SkyDrive of course so
let's look at us some of these files
is there a sample spreadsheet and we
have graphs now pretty nice and it's
pretty smooth moving through here it's
still a very basic version of Excel but
there are some improvements
next there's PowerPoint let's go up in
that and you'll see yeah
it has a portrait support now and we
have little thumbnails and we have some
pretty nice animations but our artwork
so one really cool thing about word is
say you're editing something right here
and you close it and then you open the
same file off of SkyDrive from Word 2013
on desktop or tablet it lets you pick up
right where you left off
now one thing that's special here that
you want to see is if I tap and hold of
course I can pin that document to the
Start screen if I'm working with a lot
you can delete it you can share it or
you can save it to so say I received
something that I want to upload it to
SkyDrive that's pretty easy now
and sharing NFC Bluetooth email so you
can share documents over NFC now and
look at this one this is a PDF I can
also email PDFs which is new pray okay
let's open that PDF
so this is Microsoft's new PDF Reader
which we know we had Acrobat Reader on
Windows Phone 7.5 from Adobe but look
how smooth this is much much smoother
usually tap it again to get the menu
controls back and you can navigate the
bookmarks you can jump to a page rotate
it go to next a previous page still
pretty simple basic PDF reader but
performance is a lot better than
previous versions of Acrobat Reader on
Windows Phone now what how about in
OneNote this is one of my favorite
programs let's get back out of here you
see it's completely different from the
previous version of one now on Windows
Phone here's my notebooks I can choose
to sync or not think some of them and
you can search them and here's your
recent list so that's quick access to
recent pages and let's go to this one
and I'm going to open my test notebook
where is it there it is so this is a
notebook page that I made which has all
sorts of things going on we have
embedded documents and I can easily open
those and bend a PDF this is a table
checkboxes lists everything is supported
here's a hyperlink to web page that
works fine and here's a hyperlink to
another OneNote page now this never
worked before on a mobile device but
click it from there we go so links
within OneNote pages and what is that
Inc
finally handwritten ink is readable you
can't edit it I can probably delete it
we can finally read ink that you may
have written on a tablet PC
there's your test embedded video
embedded audio all that works great
screen clippings and here's something
new that wasn't working before those are
diagrams and shape drawings those now
work and are visible the only thing that
doesn't work is the equation
password-protected notebooks are
notebook sections also do not work so
that's a quick look at Office OneNote
and the new microsoft PDF reader on
Windows Phone 8 sure to give this video
a thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
