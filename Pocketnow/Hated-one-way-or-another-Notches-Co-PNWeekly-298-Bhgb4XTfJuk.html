readers would seem to disagree we've got
a lot to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 2 9 8 of
the pocket now weekly recorded March
30th at noon pacific this weekly podcast
is where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and myspace would never
have spied on your phone calls i'm juan
carlos back now contributing editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. jules Wong out on
the east coast how's it going sir I
don't think I was ever on myspace
trained for any period of time at all
that was before I actually got
interested in connecting with people
online yeah there are definitely going
to be some proto social media
examinations histories the the
Friendster era the classmates.com
the maze I'm gonna go to geo cities and
I'm just gonna hang out there 96 that
was all of these things that sort of led
us to the the current internet
apocalypse that we find ourselves in
today but we've got a monster epic huge
baller show there was a ton of news this
week some really exciting stories that
we want
get to and of course we want to hear
from you if you want to join the
conversation during the live broadcast
join us on the Twitter's with the
hashtag P n weekly and if you're
listening to the show after the fact you
can still use that traditional email
thing it's an app on your phone or an
app on your computer I'm sure we're
gonna be answering emails the show
saying we've got viewer messages that's
exactly why we want you to join this
conversation at podcast at pocketnow.com
Jules I'm gonna turn it over right to
you because even though we're actually
gonna record a slightly longer episode
this week we still have a ton of stuff
to get to so let's get those headlines
from pocketnow.com all right well let's
get to the hardware section first plenty
of devices that have been released this
week the Huawei P 20 and P 20 Pro the
spotlights March 27th event in Paris
that has been the subject of everyone's
arousal curiosity and well just
amazement because the P 20 Pro in
particular has those three cameras that
it can wield with up to 63 megapixels of
outputs they say or just almost 63
megapixels you've stuck them all in and
with a the main camera sensor being a
very amana chromedriver 40 megapixel
sensor so it's a definitely something to
be interested in at the XO mark has
evaluated it with its mobile score of
109 points and the p20 not a slacker
with in itself only having two main
cameras on the back but it manages to
score at 102 so and those have been the
highest scores that we have seen so far
more to come of course and we move on
from there to the xiaomi me mix to s now
this follows on from the
- of course and it has been a very very
pathfinding series as an exercise in
reducing bezels and making it so that
people can enjoy more screens obviously
in 2018 this is the case with other
phones - not just let me mix su but many
others from the typical manufacturers so
in order to differentiate its we'll say
from the competition it has been able to
improve its camera game dual cameras
this time and DXL mark has scored it an
overall of a 97 with a 100 wine photo
subscore so that's time to be impressed
with for any of those people who like
basic metrics and just the basics I
guess the the elements in terms of Apple
and its education events we have the
iPad 9.7 6th generation a lot of the
same from last generation except for an
update to the chipset the a10 fusion
chipset so better graphics they are
processing and so forth and
compatibility with the Apple pencil the
stylus that's supposed to well it's only
been compatible with the iPad pros up
until this point you still have to pay
$99 for that but you get this with the
iPad 0.7 at $329 in the US and it's
supposedly the most affordable
combination of the eye tablet and stylus
that's out there or at least it's the
most affordable iPad that in Apple is
put out especially considering that
other regions have are seeing this
priced below last year's iPads not the
US but other regions like Canada and
Europe and finally as a counter than
that but before that was released iPad
was released we're talking about the
Acer Chromebook
10 which is the first Chrome unless
tablet bonafide tablet not convertible
2x2 one laptop that is a as a stylus
natively and has been the same form
factor nine point seven inch screen at
the same exact I guess you could say
we're at in a display going on right
there
and yeah $329 this is a definitely a
very competitive field that we have
going on in the educational tablets area
here so I was just wondering where
should we start here because the Huawei
P 20 is going to be I mean yeah that was
I was going back to my first point here
was this kind of incidentally because
we've already seen some tweets coming in
from the pn weekly hashtag people asking
for comparisons to the to the 1020 of
course we're talking about the p20 pro
the one that's got the the camera sensor
at fat produce really excited to see an
ultra high megapixel camera via a
megapixel camera yes alright I even I
messed up my own joke there the the I
think the exciting thing about the p20
Pro and one of the reasons why we're
seeing some of these higher scores from
DxO isn't the megapixel count it's the
fact that we're we're finally seeing a
phone in 2018 that is including a
substantially larger image sensor size
that is going to provide benefits for
photography there's a substantial
benefit when you move to a standalone
camera and it's got a much bigger image
sensor then well they were having a lot
of a comparative metrics here something
like 60 percent larger than either the s
nines or the iPhone tens sensors like
you know when you increase the the
micron sizes and just have more of them
in general that you get more light and
more information and more and it's not
just and it's not just the the number of
photo sites it's the fact that you've
got a significantly larger surface area
so for example I mean like you can look
at panasonic g5
that's a very video focused Micro Four
Thirds camera it has larger individual
photo sights than what you would find on
a nikon d80 but if we're talking about
overall image quality the D 850 is still
gonna be the Panasonic even though it
has smaller photo sights it's because
it's got a full-frame sensor it's a
larger surface area to play with you get
significantly more photographic and
shallower depth of field naturally not
with all of these software tricks and I
think that's one of the things that
lends a significant advantage to what
Huawei is doing here and again why I
keep pointing to always the spiritual
successor of classic nokia a great
partnership with a legit camera
manufacturer willing to take experiments
they've been ahead of the curve on
things like software processing and
software bouquet blur and manual
photography features this this is
looking like they're continuing to press
their reputation as the photography
phone and I don't see many other
manufacturers really stepping up to
compete in that conversation on terms of
the many features that's like a and
while we do have to offer I mean one of
them was being able to offer the option
of ISO 100 2004 400 which is that's how
many stops is that now from the bait
like so okay what the actual practical
dynamic range of a camera like this is
we've um we've been getting a couple of
their questions like daughters is asking
here that you have the PM weekly hash
tag is is the DxO mark a good benchmark
or are we just approaching a Dingell
measuring comparison now I would have
said a dongle measuring comparison now I
just keeping it all in the smartphone
family so I find DxO is entirely
internally consistent with their testing
procedure I don't believe that they
value lifestyle aspects of photography
as much as they should but I've never
found fault with their testing protocol
the biggest problem I have with DX I was
trying to sum up the entire experience
of using a camera under a 1 number score
so even though the p20 Pro scores the
highest
score possible in the single score
benchmark by the single grade benchmark
it might have deficiencies in an area
that you value and an iPhone 10 might be
the right fit for you depending on how
you like to shoot and what you like to
shoot so it's it's substantially more
valuable it's incredibly important that
if you're trying to glean from DxO mark
scores what you think you're going to
like that you actually have to really
dig into the sub scores into their sub
scores yeah yeah and it's important to
point out that they have rejiggered the
mobile scale including like okay and a
couple of other things into their
considerations I don't think that's
enough biased towards more consumer
focus the feature isn't what not that
they would like to include in their
testing but I mean it's it's a good its
basics and it's just it's very nice I'm
glad to see that they did recalculate
some of their scoring because I feel
like when we were in the first
generation pixel era they seemed to be
very impressed with post-processing
imagery while they also missed some
substantial problems with lens
manufacturing you know so so I feel like
we're seeing a company that is
approaching this conversation with a
little bit more nuance I still feel that
they miss a couple aspects of the field
the operation the the integration the
ergonomics of using a particular piece
of gadgetry cuz all of that really does
play into the overall photography
experience but but that being said I
feel that they they are entirely
internally consistent and I feel they
are a reliable resource once you get
away from the final grade once you
actually dig into all of the sub review
bullet points that they've got I think
you walk away with a much better
understanding of what it is they are
testing for now I'm not exactly sure how
this actually compares with the Lumia
1020 obviously just on like the
aggregate we're dealing with well
actually I'm not sure because I didn't
get to read that part of the spec sheet
I was focused more on the Hawaii p20 we
we delegated a lot of the coverage
between me and Adrian but I never got
this
like the whole p20 pros like mass and
whatnot as compared at least to the
Lumia 1020 which was a third or one over
2.6 the 1020 image sensor size was a 2/3
inch it was a one over 1.7 one over 2.7
it was it was ever so slightly smaller
than the 808 and like a hundred percent
bigger than most of the other phones of
its time which had third inch sensors
all right I'm gonna look it up but like
talk about just between the multiple
like responsibility is of these sensors
and whether or not these all these
sensors are duly equipped to do their
jobs we have a lot of metaphors that we
can point to in the world of photography
I mean I recently went back on my
personal channel and did a comparison
between the Lumia 1020 and the huawei
mate 10 Pro and what we've seen over you
know four years of phone manufacturing
is a lot of the lifestyle aspects of
capturing images and capturing video
have gotten so much more fluid they're
they're so much easier for people to
interact with and that's what's
impressive about capturing images with a
modern smartphone burst rates individual
captures logging RAW files really big
chunks of data that are processed
incredibly fast but that still means
that they're these the there were these
opportunities where a Lumia 1020 even
though it was ridiculously slow was
still able to outperform newer cameras
today I did a low-light test just
capturing the raw file and sort of dark
in office lighting and the 1020 is more
than capable of hanging with third inch
and one over 2.5 inch not quite half
inch image sensors it you know we
haven't seen another phone from that era
which can in any way shape or form
compete with modern phones today and you
compare it to a device which came out
shortly after like the galaxy s5 and the
performance is abysmal compared to what
the designs when he could achieve so I
always likened the 1020 to being the
medium format version of a smartphone
medium format is a
type of image sensor in professional
photography which is larger than 35
millimeter it's larger than a full-frame
camera sensor but because that surface
area is so much larger they're typically
not the best at clearing information off
of the sensor as quickly so you see them
a lot in studio portraiture very
controlled environments you're not gonna
see a Hasselblad
out on you know football field you know
you're not gonna see someone shooting
burst medium format shots to try and
capture fast action and if consumers
really want the the differences for that
big size sensor I think one of the best
examples of going up in sensor size as
an example would be looking at the
photography or the cinematography in the
film The Dark Knight the the Batman film
with the Joker because most of that film
is shot in 35 millimeter but then we see
a bunch of sections especially some
really intense action sequences which
were shot in 70 millimeter IMAX
photography it was one of the things
Nolan did which was really impressive
wasn't that he shot 70 millimeter for
the easy stuff he shot 70 millimeter for
the hard stuff and you can see a
remarkable difference in how that stuff
is framed and how that the depth of
field the focus everything sort of melts
in a completely different way than 35
millimeter photography now getting back
to phones that's what's exciting about
watching a company step up here is
because we're getting this substantially
larger image sensor it should have much
more surface area to pick up low-light
in pick up in low-light situations it
should provide a nicer softer background
blur for your bouquet and more natural
fall-off you know so you don't have as
long a depth of field and then you you
weigh all that up with modern processors
you weigh that up with you know modern
processing and hopefully we've
eliminated some of those pain points
that we had with the Lumia 1020 where
you would hit the shutter
you would capture the shot and then
you'd have like a three-second recycle
time before you could take another photo
that that's what that's what will bring
some excitement to this space from the
photography perspective I think a lot of
consumers are gonna look at this versus
a galaxy s 9 plus and say the s 9 plus
is fine it's good enough it does what I
needed to do NBD but if you do care
about the natural
quality of light capture coming off of
your chosen permanent companion camera
the thing that's bolted onto the back of
your phone and that it no longer comes
with that huge Oreo disk the 1020 had
out the back of the phone then this is
potentially a very exciting move for for
enthusiasts probably you're gonna pass
by most consumers and it's also called
the pro it's got a higher price tag it's
gonna scare away some people but if you
if you're really interested in capturing
the best possible image you can from
your phone I think Huawei has just made
a phenomenal argument for why you should
consider their products into unit I mean
the Lumia 1020 was even ahead and like
not just for the component reasons but
for the actual discourse where the best
camera smartphone or like on a
smartphone you can have is something
that you would want anyways in a more I
mean they weren't that great back in
2013 2012 so you know just having all
those megapixels what to work with at
the very least you know you would be
able to you know live your life a little
bit better knowing that hey at least I
can see my kids from far away at that
audition or whatever the heck that their
Nokia fans they got it you know even
from the NA they were already working
with substantially larger image sensors
in their competition and if it hadn't
been for Nokia rejoining the United
States under the Lumia brand I don't
think that we would have seen the the
massive there was a tectonic shift in
performance from the galaxy note 3 to
the galaxy note 4 I think Samsung and
Apple really started taking that stuff
seriously when we saw what even like a
lowly Lumia 920 could do let alone what
the 15 20 in the 10 20 were all coming
out with these really groundbreaking
features many of which are still not on
our devices today like surround sound
audio capture 4k video recording on
Qualcomm 800 series chipsets I mean they
were so far ahead of the curve on so
many of these points and we've been kind
of treading water some of that is kind
of the more esque not necessarily
Moore's law but more s
in terms of well we saw major
advancements through s4 through up to
the 800 800 800 one series and then
start to trail off just because you know
people were started working on dyes and
I think we're on a second-generation 10
nanometer processes at this point in
which you know given the rest how the
rest of the software system systems have
evolved it's just like well it's we're
just trying to push out as much
refinement and as much like little
performance whatever slight little
nuggets that we can so with last
question here before we move on to the
to the next topic because we probably
should move on
you know qua way we love you we've been
talking about you for a bit here this is
from from rohit naic i've probably
mispronounced your name does having a
bigger sensor make things better or is
it that the optics have an important
role to play in overall image quality
and smartphones optics are critically
important the quality of the glass that
lets light in to hit the sensor is very
important but and I mentioned this in my
my personal Lumia 1020 versus may 10 Pro
video if you look at a smartphone with
an aperture of f-18 you have to take
into account how tiny that image sensor
is so if you compare that against a
consumer grade DSLR an aps-c sensor like
a Canon Rebel what what they rebel
produces at f10 to f13 looks very much
like what the smartphone produces at F
1.8 again as you know the most critical
component in improving photography
improving improving image quality is the
sensor size the bigger the sensor gets
the more photographic and cinematic our
images get because we start getting to
play with other aspects of light
acquisition and aperture size depth of
field and all the other goodies that
come with having that extra real estate
so with that last point made let's
transition over to the Xiaomi me mix to
s4 just a second I I'm just wondering
what where this device is and where the
device series is
at this point in the conversation where
things have evolved to 2x1 displays are
even taller displays and are covering
more the fascia of the device and now
it's like okay so the me mix very
pioneering in its time but that time was
short-lived and now it's trying to
iterate beyond what it already is I mean
we're still dealing with generally okay
you know like very thin bezels except
for the chin below and you know people
even want that gone so does it does it
is this just the camera phone at this
point is this just the camera upgrade I
think this is still I think I think
Xiaomi has made a good faith argument
for for being the the out Appling Apple
Android device right because we're gonna
be talking about notches and stuff and
and how there are a lot of companies
that are copying some of these bad
terrible bad ideas but doing it directly
and I think Johnny looked at well what
are what are some of the pain points
involved in trying to make the bezel
framing the screen as absolutely thin as
possible we need to cut into the screen
where do we need to cut into the screen
that one question
instantly delineates the me mix to from
the rest of the competition which is
going to just copy the center cut knotch
that we see it almost seems like it was
bought in okay we're gonna move
everything down to the below section
instead of having it on the typical kind
of you know right center up facing thing
now that does mean oh sorry go ahead you
go ahead no I was just gonna say the
bone conduction technology for the
earpiece is going to have to be a thing
and you know depending on how you feel
about like having people listen in and
your conversations it's you know it's
innovative it's also perfect but I mean
we've been doing that since the Kyocera
brigadiere it actually works a lot
better than you would think it would and
tissue conduction can actually help
minimize some of the impact on just
farting your phone call audio out
because you know
how many times we've been out in public
and you see people on a video call or on
a speaker phone call and bone conduction
tissue conduction actually does provide
an extra point of audio contact that
even a speakerphone can't so I've been a
big fan of that tech and phones I'm
constantly surprised that more companies
haven't taken advantage of this if if we
care about this forehead bezel having
too much stuff then we can move some of
those components center screen and that
is a benefit to consumers it's not a
compromise it makes the phone call
experience better so you know like when
I want to see change I don't want to see
change for change sake I want to see
change because because it's an
improvement and because of the way that
they ask those questions on where can we
put some of these components immediately
they win the discussion on the design
above the companies that are just
copying Apple instantly I want to give
them a huge thumbs up for trying to find
a different conclusion to the same
questions that Apple and all these other
companies are asking where do we put
this stuff if we have to make the entire
front face of this phone all screen and
I think Xiaomi came up with a far more
elegant solution than the world's number
two smart phone manufacturer good and I
think people might be able to live the
facts that if or with the theory is that
if shot me were to implement some sort
of advanced 3d scanning feature like the
true death camera and that maybe if it
were placed on the bottom they went
minded as much anyways just because that
unintrusive there is the fact that you
know it's not in the optimal position
you'd have to hold it a little bit
weirdly for selfies as why not a penny
or two of white ya know shots but I mean
it's it's fair enough I mean this phone
to scan for your nipple
they're just treating nostril scanning I
always have that guide image of like a
sphere or your head and like how you're
supposed to train the phone and instead
they like they give you the outline
match up your nostrils with that's the
one thing that won't change from
when you are born we also call it
grandma
video video called view so we're
supposed to tilt the screen back a
little bit more or forward I'm not sure
why I could only see your I can only see
your trousers grandma it only works when
you're also backlit bright sunny day out
the window I love it no no I'm
completely Being Earnest cuz we're gonna
be talking about notch stuff more I hate
watching companies arrived at arrived
the companies that didn't ask how could
we do it better they're just looking at
how they did it the same and I don't
believe it brings any benefits but we'll
expand on that more when we get to one
Plus discussion yeah Indian and I guess
we could just love both of these
together here so well no no I think I
think you're right I mean we should we
should probably detail we've got the
apples refreshed entry because they just
said it in the frickin summary and
there's not much to write home about
beyond but no this is actually something
I just want to throw out to our viewers
and if we get some good comments on it
we'll read it now or if we hear get some
good emails from you folks we'll use
that or for future broadcast but we're
watching the education market in a
visceral three way fight Microsoft
hasn't properly joined this conversation
yet but we're seeing some really
compelling hardware with Windows 10
running on arm chromebook is a
phenomenal bang for buck platform very
few compromises for the education market
very well represented and now that they
can use Android apps this doesn't feel
like quite as limited a platform when it
was more just we're gonna put a web
browser into a laptop shell and that's
all you really need my my fear because
because Apple needs a good solution to
reach consumers and while I think their
branding is regressive and hideously
insulting to teenagers you know a little
girl wandering running around with an
iPad going what we were over that I
thought over that I think about that ad
and it makes me bristle with anger every
single
time but Apple needs a good option to
join that conversation they can't do it
with OSX
there is no MacBook which joins this
conversation well it only makes sense to
try and fight this fight with iPad $2.99
is a good price for a baller powerful
iPad but my fear is they've priced
themselves out because of the
accessories if you buy a $300 Chromebook
if you buy a $300 Chromebook you get a
$300 laptop grade you don't need
anything else if you buy a $300 iPad you
kind of still do need a keyboard and you
might need a pencil but you also might
need a mouse or something else so
best-case scenario no you have to get
the pencil you have to get the pencil
it's the new compatibility of this
season it's hot it's fresh and I gotta
tell you it's my 4 new egg we shot a
whole segment on mobile content
production not this last week's episode
with the week before Android works so
well with a bluetooth mouse I can't tell
you like it's so silly connecting it to
my phone but it works a little things so
you know I'd be fine using an iPad with
a mouse but even with the keyboard
you're talking about if you know a 30 to
50% price increase over the competition
and I feel that that largely takes Apple
out of many middle and lower
middle-class communities across the
country so I'd really be curious to hear
what our viewers have to say about that
when in the same week we got this
amazing news from an all slate Chrome OS
device Android for tablets hasn't been
particularly inspiring there's a point
I'm getting to a point where I think I'd
even want to see Chrome on a phone but
Acer going Chrome for a slate for
education this is a great idea IMO and
and comes in below Apple's price point
is a perfectly capable machine once you
accessorize it we're kind of back up
into nicer Chromebook territory I mean
this this to me looks like a much better
fit for
geordie of school districts public
school districts out there and I'd be
curious to see what our viewers and
listeners have to say about that
yeah I mean even if Android is still
kind of a hack on to Chrome OS I mean
that still has the apps for stylus
driven output and it definitely still
works even yeah so and 329 you get the
stylus with it takes out and and it's
got a sight line like there's a hole in
where the stylus goes so what you don't
lose you don't it's it's better for
those like fleet purchasers to like have
and like be able to take account of all
the kids the naughty little kids that
stick their sinuses up their noses and
whatnot but but even to the same token
into your point there is if you're if
you're in charge of a school district
and and I hope our viewers will chime in
on this do you look at this priced for
classrooms $300 Chromebook tablet or do
you look at the ecosystem of Chromebooks
and see that there are some 200 and $300
full clamshell laptops style solutions
also available and again it's it's we
want to find those solutions that
actually properly equip students to get
their work done so I'll be curious to
see what our what our our fans have and
if you do want to go with the iPad rude
like are you going to be able to make it
so you know give them the full
experience the full being you know full
abilities with the $500 per students
investment that there are some school
districts that will absolutely pull the
trigger on that but what we we suffered
a pretty embarrassing crash and burn
here LA Unified the LA some the LA
school district school districts out
here tried to front this iPad initiative
and it did not work in the most
spectacularly embarrassing way ever so
there's huge room there is like the the
general consumer market is pretty well
Big Apple Microsoft Google everyone sort
of has their team everyone's pick their
side but what we're talking about is
educating the next generation of
consumers and in part edge
educating them on how to be consumers
and if they're gonna spend their child
and hood and formative years on a
Chromebook doesn't that make them more
likely to be sort of invested into the
Google ecosystem by the time that there
are adults same thing Microsoft's same
thing apples so this is a huge fight
which doesn't have a clear leader right
now and you can I totally understand why
all three companies are fighting
massively for some kind of mind share
some kind of toehold to really start
building some momentum with with school
districts mmm and Eve so lots of battles
to be had over the next several weeks
and months to come in terms of that but
not only that also just the Chinese
outlook on the US and what they'll be
able to offer in the US just because
well allow them are being fingered for
cybersecurity threats we'll get into
that in just a few minutes but until
then we'd like to take a moment here and
talk about our sponsor yes this week a

supporting the pocket net weekly and we
baboom like little rubber butt medicine
ball all that goes buh-bam I don't know
how to come from that how about we talk
about some news more news lots of other
news e news news things I guess yeah it
is I'll have to freestyle it since the
the
yes I wasn't able to write Scripture all
these things okay let's go for it though
yeah ready do it okay for the week of
March 26 2018 this is all the news that
is fit to podcast this week it was
revealed by some Facebook leavers who
have been disgusted with the outlook of
the Cambridge annika scandal that
Facebook has been storing metadata of
all the calls and SMS from Android
phones the past several years and
facebook says that's completely legal
and that's it is able to do so because
users actually gave their permission for
it but there's some misleading going on
here because first of all the Facebook
app for Android has been targeted for
the longest time to the lowest that the
earliest version possible and it was
back then that permissions were looser
and they didn't have to be brought up by
prompt to the user at the time of
request so most users didn't really
figure that this was happening and there
was also some wording where in terms of
the permission slates that Facebook gave
to users of Facebook Messenger and
Facebook light saying that only their
contacts would be continuously synced
and there was a some different text
saying on other phones that excuse me
that context or contacted data would be
continuously uploaded and there's a
whole bunch of a reading that we can get
into that in just a few minutes so hang
tight
in the meantime Oracle has won its
appeal against Google in its
long-standing case for claims of
infringement of Google just moving whole
bunches of code from Java into Android
for their development Google has long
claimed that this has been a fair use
exercise but apparently now we're going
to have to
how much how much in terms of damages
that Google will be able to will have to
pay up Oracle has been asking for about
nine billion which was a year's worth of
profits from Andhra plus a billion
dollars so we'll have to see about that
as that case rolls along and another
several cases that have been rolling
along since the late end of last year is
and still continues to be the iPhone
throttling lawsuits you may remember her
back late last year that Apple confessed
and apologized for not not disclosing
its practices explicitly in the software
updates that triggered this throttling
be here but that has amounted to 59
class-action lawsuits against the
company for that failure of disclosure
in the first place and according to The
Wall Street Journal there will be a
possibility for those 59 class actions
to eventually merge into one huge one
and the process could take years overall
to hack through so definitely something
that we should keep an eye on especially
as well this issue gets put to bed in
terms of new hardware new software going
over to Foxconn it has announced that it
has a quiet excuse me it has not
announced but it was reported that had
acquired Belkin the peripherals
manufacturer that also owns the brands
link C's in terms of wireless
communication equipment and MIMO and a
couple of other smart home brands as
well the purchase price was nearly 900
million dollars and the the cements fox
khan's position as apple's biggest
partner it was already the world's
largest contract electronics assembly
a manufacturer and now it could be
working in two well they're already it
already had owned sharp for a time being
as a the Japanese display manufacturer
can attest but this is going to be
interesting in terms of the future of
ipad accessories iPhone accessories etc
moving on to are one of the big points
of contention this week is one plus six
and co-founder Carl pay talking with the
verge about how its fans the company's
fans should learn to love the knotch
and it's been it's been a hell of a time
trying to see how this has been going on
in terms of the fan reaction it's just a
whole bunch of complaints in visceral
insults being thrown in terms of LG they
seem to have handled this in a more
classic way or at least found a way to
do sell without too much damage to their
brand they haven't leaked too much in
terms of the g7 and there hasn't been
much consumer excitement about that but
they actually made a thread on the
antbird subreddit and asked for some
responses to that and they got higher
quality conversations going on over
there so there's that there's all the
news I survived that's and somehow let's
start back over in Facebook land because
of course you know it's been the
punching bag for and rightly so for a
lot of privacy and security hawks out
there i yeah
and deservedly um sorry i'm trying to
get back there it is I'm trying to get
out of screen sir there we go no I'm I'm
I I don't think I'm alone in being
one of the people who's very glad that
this is going down the way it is the
current state of social media of making
new services making new apps for
consumers to interact with this is going
to be the next major shift I believe in
services is you make something cool you
find some kind of traction with a
certain type of audience you have your
IPO then you need to start making money
and you start cramming either ads or
business practices which feel kind of
nefarious into the mix and Facebook will
hopefully show other people coming up in
the space that that's maybe not the best
way to go about conducting business with
consumers anymore so I hope that this
that this unraveling is public is
takedown that people understand the
value of their information the value of
their data and that we can now start
having because I kind of feel like
up-and-coming consumers you know
Millennials and younger are going to
have a much better sense of what all
this stuff is worth and if they're gonna
have a different perspective on valuing
their privacy than our generation and
older or my generation and older do
because right now especially with the
current lawmakers that we have in place
a lot of the stuff is just the
frivolousness of social media and they
don't take the actual impact of social
media and online shopping very seriously
so that's why we need to have some of
these changes and they need to be
changes of substance so Facebook has
earned all of the ill-will that they're
currently generating now what's left to
be seen is whether or not companies and
brands and consumers actually follow
through on changing their behavior right
now there's it kind of feels a little
like a very specific South Park episode
of the we're sorry we got Kotnis of
Facebook's current current discussions a
couple class action lawsuits where maybe
Facebook has to pay a million dollar
fine or something like that really isn't
going to amount to much
change but if we start to see an any
move towards consumers pulling the plug
on their Facebook accounts or their
Facebook services we started to see a
significant shift in ad revenue from
brands that are feeling pretty slighted
right now like you're not really getting
the same bang for buck that you used to
on Facebook even for how wildly
extortionist Facebook policies are with
the people who like your services that
that's really breaks out all that data
is free all that user data is free to
them so we saw a significant drop-off in
brand interactions through Facebook
because of some of the issues facing
them with the Russians so Facebook's
business model is you set up a brand
page and people like your brand page now
the people who liked your brand page
that's like subscribing to your brand
page but none of them get to see your
post unless you pay Facebook to reach
the people who have already liked your
brand now with the recent focuses on
shifting over the model towards more
family and friends content you're
getting even less for your money in
trying to reach the people who are
already subscribed to your Facebook page
let alone trying to reach out and find
new viewers new users new consumers to
take part with what you post on Facebook
so that's that's what I mean it's like
there's already a growing sentiment
around companies that now's the time to
stop putting all your eggs in the
Facebook basket
you already weren't making a great
return on your investment and now it's
gotten even worse so staying in the same
Sandlot but just in a different corner
focusing explicitly on the Android of
honor I guess some would consider it a
vulnerability but like the in terms of
just the yapping about it of saying that
iOS never really allowed this kind of
background siphoning to happen and
Google is you know just trying to play
catch-up in terms of well it started to
you know limit Play Store api targeting
so that you know
older versions can't be like developers
can't write apps for older versions of
Android like what do you think that kind
of conversation leaves us because it
might be one of the like niggling
factors in the head when it comes to
consumers by their next might phone but
right now it doesn't I don't see it
making a big sway well so yeah this is
again this is why I keep coming back to
what is it gonna take to appreciably
move the needle on consumer behavior and
I don't think we found that pain point
yet right now we're in a conversation
where I think general consumers are
starting to get the idea that companies
like Google Facebook and Amazon traffic
and user data in a very different way
than Apple does Apple still utilizes the
information that they have access to you
the information that they have on you in
a way to offer up products and services
or music recommendations things things
that still generate income but the core
of their business model and this is also
one of the reasons why you know an Apple
product likely has a contributing reason
not the main reason but a contributing
reason as to why there's a bit more of a
profit padding built into an iOS product
as opposed to a competitor's product a
bit more Headroom there is because
they're likely not making as much money
on the back end data analytics on each
of their customers so I do believe Apple
still has a good faith argument to make
in that arena when it comes to consumer
privacy its consumer behavior and
interacting with that information this
is something that I feel like we're
going to have a have to have a cultural
shift in the regulatory agencies that
are tasked with protecting us even from
our own desired behaviors it feels good
to be connected dopamine hits when you
get you know likes and responses and you
get into Twitter arguments or Facebook
debates all of these things are highly
addictive mechanisms at least it
according to the human brain it sees a
little difference from the researchers
that I've talked to that ore is compared
to like you know playing blackjack or
hitting a slot machine so it's gonna
take a while before the rational side of
the consumer space really starts to say
we don't like what Amazon does with our
information or we really don't like how
Facebook handles our privacy or Google
might have too many holes for me to want
to do business with them on a future
product I right now everything's too
tribal so if your team alexa vs. team
you know google assistant then you're
just gonna keep supporting the team that
you're already a member of if your team
galaxy and there's no way you'd ever own
an iPhone well you're not really
rationally considering your options for
not only the device that's in your
pocket but all of the services that have
access to the wealth of information and
behavior on you and that's worth talking
about not necessarily that you're going
to switch teams but at least to
understand what your potential risk
might be with any given manufacturer
yeah I mean Apple for its part you know
it says that I mean aiding trips you
know both ways and whatnot for all the
data that you sent to it and regarding
Jory Apple music service or all your
iCloud drive account or what because
because you know we can talk about
encryption so you can't intercept the
information but I don't know that
consumers fully understand that if
there's an investigation and they've
been utilizing the iCloud then Apple has
to make a good-faith effort to work with
law enforcement to give them information
that's on their servers so you know
again it's it's I don't feel these
companies have done their due diligence
and educating their consumers as to the
how pervasive these services are and
what what the potential for disclosure
might be in regards to how some of these
services have been used but this also
means that there's gonna be an
opportunity for someone to come in as a
disruptor in the desktop space I'm I've
been happy on the firefox browser I
actually went back to Firefox about two
years ago and it was sort of part timing
both Firefox and Chrome
and now one of the things that I really
like and I hope that we see the same
kind of Chrome add-on is Mozilla created
their own Facebook sandbox plug-in so
they log you out of every cookie and
tracker from Facebook in the Firefox
browser and when you open Facebook it
stays in its own self-contained bucket
so that it can't scrape any other user
data from your other browsing habits and
I want to see that extended to everybody
III don't sign into Google Chrome on my
phone I just haven't had this burning
need to link browsers across every
single glowing rectangle that I interact
with and most of what I do is just sort
of search anyway and Google's really
good at that so I don't really bookmark
things like I used to so if I could
sandbox Google from itself from the rest
of Android I'd be happy especially
Amazon - I would love to have a way to
completely sever my behavior from Amazon
because it is really creepy when certain
aspects like something completely
unrelated to my shopping on Amazon will
then start to populate purchasing
recommendations on Amazon and again it
takes a lot for a user to unravel how
those cookies are implemented and how
you can how you can separate yourself
from that kind of browsing I don't want
to have to do everything in incognito
creeper porn mode I'd rather have you
know my accounts logged in in very
specific ways so that then I can control
the flow of information to each
individual service I don't think all
consumers are gonna be that granular and
how they want to approach this stuff but
a couple better Auto mod tools would be
a huge benefit for people who are
generally starting to become better
educated as to how their data can be
compromised they're not as much as
granular as they are glass
you know just melted and when I just
wanted that straight its convenience and
it's you know just resigning yourself to
the fact that data is data it's gonna be
out there it's being traded freely and
at some point I I think that
you know the fact that privacy as a
concept is just going to flow by the
wayside and you know with you but the
thing that I hope that we don't lose
sight of and this is something that I
think Americans will care about I think
they'll care less about their their
privacy then they will about the
potential value when when a consumer
figures out that their behavior their
usage and their information contributes
value to Facebook that they don't
necessarily get a return on that's
actually something that I think is worth
joining the conversation on you know
it's just as a transactional chip yeah
YouTube do monetizes your video but it's
still a benefit and it still enriches
the YouTube platform well why why do you
want to work for Google for free in
making their platform better why not go
somewhere else it's going to value your
contribution as a content creator and
you know you can build your own tools
for trying to monetize your traffic you
know those types of conversations matter
to these mega platform because we think
of Google Facebook Amazon as
institutions but you know and whenever
the market gets a little complacent
whenever we get sort of an oligopoly
where there's only a handful of players
at the top that is a dangerous place for
a company that's no longer going to
innovate but is instead just gonna try
and profit off of the investment that
they've made because the disrupter can
come in and show people a different way
to go about doing business and that's
left numerous companies ill-prepared for
a future where their products are their
offerings don't quite spark the same
amount of imagination in in this current
internet space that evolution happens
fast I mean look at the difference
between snapchat and Instagram over the
last three years you know that's not a
lot of time for two companies to be
fighting this hard and for one to
completely you know throw away most of
their user goodwill yeah
so speaking of user goodwill I think how
we're going to stack all this next topic
as general in general is that I'll just
go through
first two stories here just a little bit
and then we'll transition immediately
into one of the listener mails because
like this please just roll into one
point here so with one plus just trying
to survive in the massive sea of leaks
and clickbait as Carl pace says
clickbait articles talking about these
leaks he generated some noise about his
own company and just button that users
should learn to love the knotch now I
understand they they're continuing to
the be that aspiring company that wants
to be in the mainstream and we're like
the Apple iPhone 10 is kind of the thing
and it's it's accepted and whatnot but
not in its current state where the tech
enthusiasts are like no aesthetics suck
and it doesn't provide as much value as
you think to us listen to us please do
not ignore us and front like the freakin
discourse on this is kind of just toxic
but hit like it the same point is made
and it's very very clear I so let me
just give us a couple examples here and
then cuz Carl pay deleted his tweet so
we have this one from Siobhan Jesse hey
Carl pay at get paid I think you have
deleted your tweet about the knotch
I just want to know why he tried he
trolled Xiaomi when they deleted their
tweet of the poll of users preferring
pure Android to me UI so you should
probably clarify this and I love
technology so I ain't biased towards
different companies you got this one
from marina outs learn to love the
knotch your company is a small fry in
the smartphone industry Carl pay you
should try listening to your audience
and then there was this one I don't know
if you had the article up the the one
that I am
but if you pull that back up and yeah
there it is is from do IDO van doom the
only acceptable reason for not a 1 plus
6 would be a bottle opener so I mean it
depends on what kind of utility you're
actually looking for in that design but
so I mean obviously with the iPhone 10
being the only way to make a phone I
realize we have been woefully inadequate
ly serving our audience so from now on
I'm gonna do iPhone 10 view because this
is really how people want to look at
video content on displays so this this
looks great to me is into the screen and
cutting into the display to make sure
that you can put on a slightly better
web camera don't you don't you have
software to block that off I'd like to
make sure that the whole I just want to
make the entire the entire side to that
point black well that's that's better
it's cutting into the screen and it's
basically kind of the same thing as like
the megapixel warsi actually I'm gonna
go back because I kind of like you know
the Punisher the bad years it's that now
we can count that as being part of the
screen so so like the little ear here at
the top that still counts according to
Apple is part of your usable display
area and that's why it's a 19 point 5 by
9 aspect ratio screen so even though
it's a 5.8 inch screen it's still got
way less or if it is not way less it's
still got less surface area than the 5.5
inch screen on the iPhone 8 plus but
this is still usable this is still
totally usable this right here you can
still use the quote-unquote awareness of
cheating we're not lying when we say
it's a 19 point 5 by 9 aspect ratio
display all right so like I know but
isn't isn't isn't the arguments though
that 16 by 9 content is gonna like is
the mass the majority of what we consume
these days still gonna be just fine on
the screen
well no that's that it that is part of
the problem is if you use the full
display
from Apple's perspective if you use the
full display then it cuts into using the
full display
if these because that's what's that
because just from a resolution
perspective like if like it's 1080 wide
just like if you fill it from the bottom
in 1920 it should only reach the notch
anyways like what's in you're getting
the same resolution that's just it is
when we're talking about media
consumption we're only talking about
sixteen by nine video if you watch a
feature film on your phone that's
usually 2.35 you know it's even wider
than your it's even skinnier than the
aspect ratio of your phone screen so it
would take up the full length of your
screen and still give you letter boxing
on top but on one side because the
screen is asymmetrical and we love ASA
asymmetry like I could put a notch over
here too but why why because this is
great having part of one side of the
screen completely chopped in so you
mentioning that like if you want to
bring it up because like one of the
things that people have been imagining
about the HTC you 12 plus is that you
know they could do double notches for
the boomsound totally and that would
also be terrible design it it would be
terrible design but great yeah the the
main point that I'm getting to one the
asymmetry does bother me but to until we
come up with another metaphor for
interacting with data in services the
most important aspect of phone design is
the screen through which we interact
with our data that is the portal through
which a majority of our interactions
take place a majority of our content is
consumed and cutting into that portal to
deliver a better web camera is bad
design now we can minimize some of the
impact on that in in different ways you
know we're looking at some of the the
test mock-ups something like the p20
having just like a total strip so that
that's dead space and we really just
created a ditch
bezel and that's fine but why go through
these shenanigans to create a digital
bezel space when we could have just put
a bezel at the top of the phone it also
is frustrating because we start talking
about an all screen device that's not
necessarily the best for the ergonomics
on things like your keyboard I'm not
impressed by people who complain about
the dead space underneath the iPhone 10
keyboard you don't want the keyboard all
the way down at the bottom chin and for
me I really don't want six inch two by
one aspect ratio screens with no space
at the bottom for my navigation controls
I don't like having to reach my thumb
down to a tiny bezel this edge balancing
a top-heavy device to try and interact
with that as a daily driver device I I
don't think that's good ergonomics and
especially with an all screen all glass
almost no bezel device these things are
going to be more fragile there's less
impact zone for these devices as you go
about and you abuse them during your
daily life so you but redefine the
concept of usable space on a display
like the ergonomics make as to make
digital bezels for you so you don't
forget that space in a bunch of usage
scenarios and you lose some of your
space if the apps coded for a knotch
screen phone will cut it will cut the
content around the knotch so so there
are some apps and some games which
haven't you know totally made that
migration over to iPhone 10
understanding and so you lose a piece of
that app you lose a piece of that game
it interrupts what should just be a
fluid visual aesthetic or a seamless
design okay
so I get your opinion about the knotch
and I get everything that's going about
it in terms of even do more notch
see more notch is better Apple Apple did
some notch we should do even more notch
and that's how you out Apple Apple you
don't ask different questions like Jamie
did you don't try and find a different
solution you just do the same thing
that's how competition no no no here
here's here's here's here's innovation
you cut but you'd like you make the
notch into a full bar and just have two
screens on each side and that's gonna be
its new form factor like that I mean
that's innovation right there cuz what
reibe does he just cut across the entire
screen and you just have a four head
bezel like Samsung did funny that seems
to work really well I well if it were
two displays maybe this could be the ax
on em like the next Jim yeah and and
I've I've gotten really cranky about
that too I when we see some of the
amazing work being done on an augmented
reality by the time we get a good
consumer durable practical example of a
folding or roll out display it'll
already be obsolete when you see some of
them even like leap motion has been
doing and one of their one of these
other developers who did on consumer
grade hardware wasn't like it was being
run off a workstation but just like
normal everyday computing stuff off a
laptop and he was able to track his hand
and pull out an interface which docked
to his hand and was rendered in real
time I'm not impressed with the current
metaphor that we have for phones I look
at this as just being the epitome of
laziness companies who aren't really
challenging themselves to come up with
better solutions in their competition
and this metaphor is quickly going to
become obsolete in the face of
Terminator vision style solutions and we
seem oh my god the eye bezels that I've
got to see the freakin I'll have to add
a picture frame to my world view just so
that I can feel like I'm using a phone
again because that's what that's what
makes things better you know but when
you look at a major corporation like
Intel getting into the ergonomics and
the usage of augmented reality glasses
that's serious
dangerous competition for a company like
qua Way or Samsung or any of these other
smartphone manufacturers because then
we're not staring at their little
picture frame portal into the Internet
we're letting Intel beam that stuff to
correctly into the back of our optic
nerve you know I don't even have to look
at the Huawei branding on the front of
my phone anymore it's just the
information I want is freely cleanly
displayed right in my field of view
right in my vision and that's way less
disruptive way less distracting and far
more accessible than anything we could
do with a foldable rollable transparent
pocketable smartphone device that's
going to be the future but going back
into twenty eighteen times and just
talking about oneplus I mean they so
obviously for the right audience and the
rates you know current accompany the
this was a failure in terms of the
discussion of the the knotch
but how do you think LG handled it
because you know reddit LG we handled
the discussion way more gracefully
tremendously more gracefully but now the
danger is so so Karl pay isn't
completely wrong in that a bunch of
companies are just going to copy Apple
and consumers are gonna have to deal
with it because what if you're a oneplus
fan are you gonna go get another phone
no because your team oneplus and we feel
that we've already locked you in and
we've got your money and we deserve your
money so we can put out whatever we want
but there's also something kind of
intellectually honest about that he's
not backtracking well he deleted his
tweet but it's not like they're
redesigning the phone based on consumer
feedback this is the path moving forward
you can be on board or you can get some
other device which your tribalism will
probably emotionally prevent you from
just jumping ship immediately from their
perspective now a company like LG has
put out a conversation they've they've
garnered some phenomenal respectful
feedback and if they take all that and
just say now we still just decided to do
a notch even though all the questions we
asked people said that the notch was
terrible then that's going to view their
contribution that the discussion is
disingenuous so there's there's a
potential pitfall on both sides with
Karl pay's solution of being forthright
being kind of blunt and
and sort of taking a part of his
audience for granted because of the
tribalism aspect then you you run the
risk of turning off some of your heavy
users and pushing them towards a
complete competitors product with LG you
garner goodwill up front but then every
customer who doesn't feel like they get
what they want
runs the risk of feeling disenfranchised
well I I wrote this great post on reddit
- LG and then they went and did
something that I didn't want them to do
you know there's a good chunk of people
who are gonna feel that way regardless
that it won't matter they'll feel like
they're their concerns weren't taken
seriously so I understand that the
potential pitfalls but I feel if LG
really joins a conversation listens to
the consumers that are talking to them
then though whether this more gracefully
than one plus did I mean it's already
set for the g7 if what we believed to
have seen from you know the leaks the
MWC showing it's gonna have a notch so
um you know the best you know it it's
all about spin control and damage
control at this point but but but I mean
by one as we need to just do the podcast
for you know like the iPhone iPhone 10
version of this podcast from now on I
really didn't didn't take you know
people's usage into consideration I I
have to apologize to all the people that
watch our stream that I I wasn't I
wasn't taking you know notch them
seriously obviously this is what people
want and their spirit this is what
people would actually want people want
and scenes and things like that you know
things that interrupt the screen and
it's like that's what people want I will
be happy to give it to them so so that's
that's the jam and I'm really glad that
people just don't want to look at my
face so this is actually a good use for
the I don't that's also why someone
asked like why is one all framed rule of
thirds and it's a terrible reason but
I'm having fun with it so we're just
we're just gonna abuse our cameras for a
little bit just trying to cover it up in
different things in ways that don't
benefit the listener at all we have run
out of the port I mention a
you know the the p20 knotch and how it
can be sort of you know hide the notch
or have a default where it cuts into the
screen and a lot of people like to bring
up the v10 and the v20 ticker displays
and that's not the same thing
the ticker display on a v10 or v20 was
and it was its if expand on
notifications and to provide shortcuts
and didn't cut into the active space
that could be utilized for camera for
the viewfinder on your camera for
multimedia content streaming videos apps
didn't have to figure out how to work
around any kind of cut out into the
screen it just provided additional space
and shortcuts on top of it it's not the
same thing
now we would all agree that the v10 in
the V 20 were charmingly ugly phones
then asymmetry is a big deal when you
have a ticker display that doesn't run
the full length of the screen at the top
but the main viewing area in the main
interaction space on those phones was
not hampered by having a larger webcam a
selfie camera didn't alter my ability to
fullscreen cinematically shot content or
to view full screen YouTube content with
a crop or to play some of my favorite
older games which aren't resolution or
aspect ratio aware doesn't touch on any
of that so I ticker displays not the
same thing as a knotch
so there you have it III don't know how
we can transition after this blow a
piece of mail here at this point but you
know what as well so in unto our March
mailbag here talking about a whole bunch
of other topics but we will stay on the
topic for the notch with the notch for
just a second goran petrovic asks you
have any thoughts on emil proto Lansky's
VentureBeat column on buying only phones
with headphone jacks and no notches also
can juan explaining exactly what are the
benefits of USBC audio over 3.5
millimeter in theory and compare that
with the rial
the thanks guys gone so let's talk about
the viterbi article here first
the title is Probie yeh headphone jacks
nay notches it's kind of sort of
extremist did not not like actually
being radical but in terms of like going
to the ends of the scale here in terms
of well if I want a phone these days I'm
going to have one without a freakin
notch on it because I hate that and I
also want you know the analog audio that
I've always been used to and you know
it's these kinds of I'd again not to be
pejorative but like regressive kind of
you know yeah we have a link to that
like in the show notes or at least on
the YouTube video where people can catch
that yeah it's it's in the it's in the
this is I mean you know we're talking
about an editorial and we're talking
about I can't Amil proto Lansky proto
Linda yeah a male's opinion on on the
state of the industry and I think it
lines up well with numerous enthusiasts
and so people who are more likely to
judge an individual device across the
entire market further across the entire
ecosystem so when like an Evan Blas and
Evy leaks you know puts out a poll
saying like you know what do you think
about notches and 65 percent of the
people that reply say they don't like
notches we're not getting a
representation of consumers we're
getting a representation on smartphone
fans who followed these kinds of
conversations to the to the main point
I agree until we get rid of the the
smartphone screen as the main
interaction space and what I want my
phone to become is the brain the battery
and the radios for an ecosystem of
personal area networking equipment
better audio better heads-up display
tech better body sensors etc etc etc I
don't want to have to
keep looking at a phone screen for every
interaction that I that I encounter when
it comes to digital information
I completely agree I would rather have
nicer rectangle screens I'm not you know
I'm not offended by rounded corners on
those rectangles because usually that
often falls into navigation space and it
doesn't really impact my ability to see
notifications you know the list of crazy
notifications that I never clear from
from the the notification shade on my
phone it doesn't get in the way of the
back home in multitasking buttons you
know cutting the corners off in a
battlestar galactica kind of way is far
less offensive than cutting in to the
main display the the problem is we're
not indicative of the bulk of sales and
so when we see a company like Apple sell
a significant number of iPhone tens
thousand dollar phones this phone sold
really well
don't let market analysts convince you
otherwise don't let market analysts make
you think that the iPhone 10 was a flop
it just didn't completely Eclipse the
iPhone 8 it's still one of the best
selling phones of the last year when
many other manufacturers see that you
can disrupt the display to compromise
the display for other sensors on the
phone and associate that with that
priced device they're going to say well
we can do some similar things we can
make our products less expensive and
that looks like success so we can just
copy it so unfortunately because of sort
of this fashion brand fashion label
tribalism you know if if Samsung were to
do this tomorrow everyone who was
complaining about the notch would
grumble and still get their next Galaxy
if Samsung were to get rid of the 3.5
millimeter jack next year a ton of
people are gonna grumble and then
they're still gonna go and buy their
Galaxy I you look at like Nexus to pixel
fans similar types of behavior and like
oh well I learned to get you know get
around it or I learned to deal with it
or maybe it wasn't as big a deal as I
thought it was that that kind of lobster
potting is pretty clear across the
entire market so I think we all just
kind of have to get used to the notion
that as enthusiasts the individual
things we care
about like removable batteries 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks unmolested
screens are gonna go away because
consumers outspend us meteoric Li you
know it's just you know exponentially
more sales from general consumers who
are attacked into an apple samsung
ecosystem then enthusiasts who care
about a you know more representation
across the entire industry and you
should have the option and the chance to
exercise that in terms of your purchases
well it's the part we say vote with your
wallet but that's awesome like do you
want a flagship phone in 2018 how do you
vote with your wallet to get a
replaceable battery if that's if that's
a feature you care about there is no
more voting with your wallet because the
bulk of consumers passed that by he
didn't care about it enough to fight for
it so what you want to do if your wallet
is go to the cnc factory and just place
an order for a few thousand shells take
it to crowdfunding and see if we can
make our own enthusiast phone and fight
like every other smaller and upstart
smartphone brand to try and bring I mean
there is fearful now they have they're
kind of replaceable good for the
environment kind of thing going on for
that we're like every part is
replaceable but the people that again I
don't think it ever would have been a
major consumer hit but enthusiasts would
love the idea of a truly modular phone
replaced being able to replace the
screen on your own being able to pick
you know camera and sound components
being able but that's just too much
hassle for the regular consumer I don't
want to have to deal with that I think
it's too confusing for the general
consumer but this might be a point where
enthusiasts reclaim part of the
discussion for themselves just like PC
builders do you know like we keep saying
you know we're in the post PC era the
death of the PC and yet every year we
see incredible things happen with gaming
machines with laptops convertibles
foldable machines blurring the lines
between traditional computing and touch
computing I yesterday on Newegg now we
got to play with the Hades Canyon nuke
the
new ultra small form-factor PC from
Intel we had nine displays connected to
it we were running an HTC vive pro off
of a box which is about of about half
the size maybe even closer to a third
the size of a Playstation 4 you know and
it's a full-fledged baller powerful
Micro PC I mean the we keep saying PC is
dead this is the smartphone Eris is the
mobile era and yet incredible things
keep getting released in that space so
there could be a company out there who
could make a good faith argument to say
you know we're working on some way of
creating driver support for Android or
maybe we'll go to Chrome OS we'll make a
chrome phone because somehow maybe
Chrome is better capable of detecting
Hardware differences and then from there
ultra ultra mobile pick out every
component and go to town with exactly
the hardware build that you want I'm
just gonna port fuchsia on to my laptop
and that'll be it yep but you know
that's such a good a good point though
is sorry
kind of brain fart there and then
derailed and I'm trying to get back on
track um look it's look at the progress
that's being made by Microsoft in
supporting mobile chipsets there's an
end run around the current smartphone
industry that Microsoft could do this is
way out Lee outside the league this is
not supported by any corporate evidence
that Microsoft might be working on
something like this but if Windows 10
actually starts running well on ARM chip
sets to the point where it's like
seamless performance between a nicely
decently spec mid-range laptop and a
Qualcomm 845 it wouldn't take much to
revamp the Windows 10 UI focusing on
sort of the tablet touch mode that a lot
of laptops have the Qualcomm 845 is
already gonna come with LTE radios and
Windows is already really good at
detecting Hardware detected with knowing
what drivers it needs to support a piece
of hardware updates come directly from
Microsoft we could eventually find
ourselves in a position yet again where
micro
could make another play on the
smartphone industry this is the worst
way to do it and they've earned no
goodwill no trust the way that they've
handled phones in the past but if you
want that truly modular I put it
together myself this is the perfect
device because I made it for me
Windows 10 could be the best bet I don't
know I mean I don't see it coming from
Google everything that I see coming from
Google is restricting customization and
some of that choice and trying to rein
in their manufacturing partners so the
Android is a more unified platform
you're definitely never gonna get it
from Apple so who does that leave
yeah a good segue by the way thank you
for that with Zayn's sure baaji's email
here hey podcast pimps do you not call
us podcast pimps by the way I was
trolling Android pecan because I called
Vince now from now on it will just be
podcast pimps Android podcast pimps I
was trolling Android podcast pimps
comment sections that doesn't sound like
a good treat by the way and it seems
like the vocal minority are up in arms
over Android P what is your opinion on
some of the changes like no rootless
substratum the theming app that you
could use to get to the overlay manager
or quick-setting toggles being nerfed
thank you and keep up the text Capades
zing so there's been a change down org
partition concerning this android custom
overlay controversy and how oh it's
where we're going after Adam Lynette
listen ski who locked down this stupid
little feature for no good reason at all
so yeah talk about that for a second
well this is exactly what I'm getting at
and we've had some of these
conversations in the past both on this
show also when I've been on some other
podcasts like like bored at work we've
gotten to some pretty pretty brutal
debates about some of these tactics on
the one hand I think Google reining in
Android is probably better for most
consumers out there III think that's
unfortunately the future we need to face
where some of the
wide open Wild West nature of Android is
no longer charming the update situation
on Android is is not good and we need to
find ways to better distribute patches
bug fixes security exploits and full
operating system updates and we also
need to start addressing the fact that
we're making increasingly expensive
devices that are kind of becoming more
disposable not less too much material
too much manpower too much money goes
into the creation of these things for
them to be like year and a half two year
gadgets when consumers are trying to
push their smartphone usage longer and I
feel corporations are doing a poor job
of acknowledging this trend in user
frugal Ness instead making it more
likely that your phone's gonna get
damaged or need to be replaced or you're
just not gonna get software updates and
that's how you get the new software is
to buy a new $900 phone that's not
support that's a poor excuse for support
and even our top players are guilty of
some pretty pretty poor track records on
keeping their customers protected and
up-to-date so when it comes to these
types of moves you know again we're
looking at Google trying to pivot and
trying to make Android less intimidating
more appealing there's still a whole
bunch of space where iOS can stomp on it
and one of the ways that you do that is
you reign in enthusiast features you
rein in potential exploits and anything
that requires additional effort to
support enthusiasts it's probably
something that's going to be on the
chopping block over the next couple
years so you make a good point that
Google doesn't have any burning and any
burning consideration for you know
theming features that may be 0.05
percent of Android users are going to
take advantage of how much developer
resource and how much developer support
should they extend knowing that of those
point oh five they're also probably
going to have to handle some support
calls from people who somehow managed to
screw something up you know you can
never completely anticipate every user
action or every user complaint and even
minor things which take
time suddenly starts to make that look
less and less and less attractive to
Google as an outlet so why have a dark
theme you can kind of just match the
wallpaper if they have a dark wallpaper
then sure some elements of the phone
will also darken up a little bit good
enough that's all you need you don't
need anything else it's touch square get
app it's the exact same metaphor that
we've used since Xerox invented sort of
gooeys and you know look you don't have
to touch touch square you can touch like
a squirrel or like some beautiful like
briefly draw an element that has vectors
in its space and you don't have to
actually like they and that's what these
people are arguing fro now what I will
say and it's just it's hilarious though
that you said it doesn't have to be a
square I I'm sorry this is a tangent
it's not related to what you're talking
about we'll get back on track my my V 30
finally got its Oriole update and so I
run Nova Launcher and I customized all
of my icons and I went with circles and
for whatever reason Oreo even though it
kept Nova Launcher as my launcher
changed all of my icons to squares so it
will be touch squared it will be touched
and decided I was wrong for wanting
circles on my Nova Launcher I digress
apologize I didn't mean to do that
no no no it's it it gets to the point
here because silly and this you know
right you know we talking about Android
PE or Android Oreo post March just
reverting all these changes as including
the overlay manager service just the the
one paragraph here from the change.org
petition against Adam listen ski or a
Ford Adams and whatever Google to
reinstate the overlay manager service it
is no small feat it's a constant running
service in the background of your device
to allow for resource replay was
replacements on target packages stop
right there
background processes are getting a real
good thrashing
not just in you know
Android when the whole of the you know
mobile space but just because yeah it's
not just it could be just for one
service that's internal and whatnot but
it could be hijacked for more elevated
privileged information and other kinds
of things to go on with your sensors and
hardware and whatnot and given the
concerns that we've had over Facebook
and over other such like targets just
being able to exploit these background
processes including smart home or or the
apps that record your voice and or
record TVs and and like serve you ads
based on what they listen to like that
that's a big deal so like they don't
have to say anything it's the even
though it's the AOSP Gerrits they don't
have to necessarily be open about the
reasons for why they're doing whatever
they're doing but like you take into
consideration the whole of the
environment and not just the fact that
Android is free and we're waving or
Heelys flag because that's the sign of
freedom like it feels like the wrong the
Liberty libertarians is like no in
Google sandbox and so first of all the
amount of effort and energy that went
into creating even this change.org
petition is gonna amount to nothing I
don't believe petitions in the slightest
sway corporate or political opinions
from people who actually matter as
decision-makers what we're left with and
again because we we couldn't keep
Microsoft in the fight I I shouldn't say
it that way Microsoft couldn't keep
themselves in the fight consumers were
right to walk away from Windows Phone
even if we enthusiasts found a lot to
like there and I'm still gonna point to
Windows Phone 8.1 as being one of my
all-time favorite you eyes and just
performance customization everything was
so much better than the compromises you
would have to make in Android or an iOS
at the time but now we're stuck with two
two players so you either get a Google
or you either get an apple they're not
gonna change their behavior they've got
you know the majority of the consumer
base locked up not until I mean it's
saying vote with your wallet is entirely
disingenuous because
what what store are you gonna go to oh
you don't like the customization options
that we have on Android well you're
gonna hate I owe s even more yeah like
there's no safe harbor for you there
your options are gonna be increasingly
to do things like route and get into
less consumer friendly ways of
extracting the information or the the UI
elements that you want and customizing
them yourself and if that's a solution
that's fine for you great but for the
few consumers who were maybe maybe
interested in some of that ability but
didn't want to have to completely crack
open their phones to do it they're just
gonna move on they're just gonna get on
with their lives it probably wasn't
going to be as burning a concern for
them and will increasingly entrench the
tribalism of the Google users and the
iPhone users and that's going to the
word of the day is tribalism yeah part
of the conversation for things over
these last couple weeks in news in tech
news and in entertainment news and so
you know like voting with your wallet
would mean like are you gonna go to
Sailfish are you gonna go to some kind
of linux are you gonna see firefox OS on
a phone well no because instantly
a ton of tech reviewer elites will say
oh but it's not good enough oh it's not
ready oh it doesn't do this oh you can't
do that and you're never gonna jump on
board if we had listened to the first
generation reviews from the original
Microsoft Surface the surface should
have died it was a terrible product how
could anyone like that no this is
horrible in Windows 8 it's completely
unusable I mean you can't do anything on
it well it took like three years of
losing in the marketplace of ideas for
Microsoft to find footing with general
consumers to say that the surface pro
was a great idea and now look at the the
insane number of variations on that same
idea that we have today they had to
ignore and lose in the market all that
time to get there and I don't see any
company with the fortitude to really
make that shift right now everyone's
trying to play it safe which is why we I
feel we need to see some some more
aggressive disruption away from the
phone
self the next time you see a are goggles
and the next time you see a heads-up
display the next time you see better
voice interactions better headsets
better audio I give it a shot
because that's actually what's gonna
pull us out of this tech malaise you
know that's actually what's gonna move
the needle on improving our interaction
with data in services and not just
holding in the same pattern that we've
been in for the last four generations of
smartphone maybe five if I can go back
to a Galaxy Note 4 and still feel
totally well served by that experience
how far have we really progressed can I
shoot 4k video do I have a Q a quad HD
display do I have great battery life I
don't have water resistance but I can
replace the battery myself because I'm a
grown-up and I should be able to do
those things pen touch fine point
controls great build quality ah it's
fine that phone still holds up today so
what are we doing what amazing
advancements have we seen since the note
4 that really changed the discussion on
how we use data in services and I I
can't really point to many I don't have
to tell you things are bad everything
everybody knows things are bad I'm mad
as heck and I'm not gonna take it
anymore
4 you are messing with the primal forces
of nature and you all right by the way
we didn't forget gowron's second
question here which is the benefits of a
USBC audio over 3.5 in theory and in
reality so so USBC audio is a
double-edged sword right now it's not
consistently employed so like some
dongles like um this is this is one of
the things that frustrates me I really
like the mate temper oh I really do like
that phone I miss having a built-in
headphone jack but Huawei wasn't really
known for the best headphone jacks like
they were usually mid-pack at best
sometimes even more mediocre but the
thing that is super annoying about the
main' temp' row is this dongle does not
have a
this dongle will not be recognized as a
USB audio device on other technology
products so I can plug this into the
Thunderbolt port on my laptop or on
another phone with the USB C port and
this headphone jack does not show up
that confuses the consumer market
because this is a universal port because
it has to plug into the bottom of the
phone but it's proprietary to one line
of devices I think this will work on a
Motorola I think they used the same pin
out so that the Motorola dongle and the
Huawei dongle will talk to each other
that's not a good ecosystem partner it's
what's gonna be most compatible but what
is frustrating is if you take Huawei's
headphones huawei's headphones do have a
DAC built into them so the dongle won't
work on any other devices if you want to
use your own headphones but you can take
the Huawei and they use the really
terrible ear pod style design you take
that dongle and you plug it into my
laptop or you plug it into another phone
and it does show up as a USB audio
device ultimately if we're going to get
rid of the 3.5 millimeter jack there
there's a give-and-take so prone con the
con is we lose a great Universal phone
Oh Jack this is one of the last true
Universal standards it's a true standard
that everyone could participate with and
the licensing there wasn't any it's not
like how you have to license a lightning
connector from Apple to make your Apple
accessories and there's just decades and
decades and decades of amazing products
that you can take part in you know
headphones and speakers and different
connectors and stuff that can plug
directly into these devices and deliver
truly fantastic performance when
properly supported the flipside to that
is this opens up the potential for audio
manufacturers to take the discussion to
consumers directly so let's say all you
can afford is like a $200 phone but you
scrimped and saved for a great pair of
headphones
chances are really low that that $200
phone is gonna properly drive your
investment in a nice pair of headphones
but let's say those headphones were from
a company like Sennheiser if Sennheiser
made a pair of USBC headphones it
wouldn't matter what device you took
those headphones to it could be a $200
phone it could be a thousand dollar
phone but you would trust that
Sennheiser had delivered the audio
hardware to properly drive that
experience and you could plug it
directly into the bottom of the phone
and you're good to go and and that that
would have probably a higher longevity
than Bluetooth because you don't have to
worry about a battery it's powered
directly off the battery of the device
not having a like a Bluetooth wireless
battery so you spend $200 on a cabled
pair of headphones but with an amazing
DAC tailor fit exactly to those
headphones is a better solution
long-term than having another wireless
thing that you have to charge every
night so again it's it's a little
complicated still right now but it is
getting better a lot of new USB products
coming out are more Universal Google it
was a step in the right direction the
dongle for the pixel 2 is pretty good
it's not nearly as terrible as the
headphone jack was on on the
first-generation pixel the dongle on
pixel 2 is is noticeably better than the
headphone jack on pixel 1 so pixel 1
more convenient you don't ever have to
worry about losing your dongle but audio
quality noticeably poorer so what do you
want do you want the convenience of
sound tracking then you want something
with a built in a pixel with a built in
Jack if you want a higher quality
experience you go with the dongle lastly
I should just sort of clarify again
under sort of my personal escapades I've
been trying to talk more about like
lifestyle and fitness and health and
things like that just adjacent to the
world of technology and the last the
beginning of this week I sat down with
one of the top audiologists in the
country and I have a recorded interview
where I asked her some questions about
recent trends in in teen young adult and
adult hearing loss you know a trends
that correlate
the rise of smartphones over the last 10
years and we're seeing significant
degradation at younger and younger ages
from people who are heavy consumers of
audio and I asked her point-blank about
the different types of headphones that
people can buy so like inner aural
earbuds cans and ear pods style designs
and spoiler alert the commentary on ear
pod style headphones probably isn't the
most flattering for a company like Apple
as it pertains to how valuable you think
your hearing is to you so if your
hearing isn't worth more than the
absolutely crap nearly disposable
headphones that came included with your
phone then you're fine if you just don't
value your health or your ability to
hear things into your 30s and 40s then
you're good just keep using that but
also keep your volume down and you'll be
fine where you go it's a half hour
conversation and you can find it if you
search for my own personal stuff because
it kind of goes hand in hand with some
of the things we're talking about here
so I think this helps join the
conversation and it's not just me
guessing what might be better or worse
from you this is the the she has a focus
in pediatrics she's one of the top
audiologists in the country and she's
the director of the audiology department
at UCLA so there's there's enough you
would hope that she's knowing respect
that she's you know she knows what she's
talking about and is something that I
don't feel a number of companies have
properly addressed you know we're gonna
give you a pair of headphones Wow how
convenient how great depending on what
you're using how they fit and what you
listen to and how you listen to that
stuff you're just gonna train yourself
to listen in ways which will permanently
damage your hearing any damage done to
the ear is irrevocable your ear does not
heal it just feels better after it
acclimates to the damage that's been
done so this is not good for future
generations of consumers because we're
training them with these types of
products to listen in unhealthy ways and
we're cutting we're saying it's a
benefit but I digress it's a half hour
conversation you can catch it dr. Alison
Grimes some gadget guy
smartphones and hearing loss you can
find me on your favorite podcast
catchers right alongside the pocket now
a promotion self-promotion and speaking
of promotion I'm going to refrain from
comment for this last email here which
was truncated for length but Roland
Ranade Laporte goes on to write Google
is the one and only to blame for the
fall and continuous syncing of Android
here where LS this was from two weeks
ago when a really aggressive debate
about who was to blame for the collapse
of Android where's popularity Google or
the OEMs and it was taking the position
of the OEMs where everyone else for
right or wrong chose Google now we're
not on the poor it has been on the
Google side of things to blame and he
continues on to say that you know how
cool is the Wonder that's the one and

up the good work
King just kidding so and I full
appointed a bunch of things here so I'll

the same flaws and shortcomings of when

charging one more gadget every day the
software is a disaster how it looks how
it performs the possibilities of what
I'm able to do the navigation everything
is terrible

TouchWiz or Bui Wars with the typical
fight over software update schedules and
bloatware

watchmakers that have boarded the
sinking ship are here because there is
no other option they don't have the
knowledge or the means to create and
maintain a whole new ecosystem for
themselves Samsung's Tizen framework
