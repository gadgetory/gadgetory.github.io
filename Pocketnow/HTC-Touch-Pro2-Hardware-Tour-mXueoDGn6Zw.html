pocketnow.com
and this is the hardware tour of the HTC
Touch pro2
the European version whether you're in
the iPhone world or Android world or
Windows Mobile world you probably know
about this phone it's getting a lot of
attention and it may shape up to be the
hottest device of this year especially
for the mobile professionals and as
you're gonna see through this
demonstration it has a lot of features
that are really targeted to people that
need to be on the road and be able to
communicate with their with their
co-workers and friends and business
professionals and things like that so to
start the case that it comes comes with
as you saw on the unboxing is actually
real leather it's not a holster and it
doesn't clip onto your belt and I don't
see a way of doing that but it is a
really nice way to protect the touch
pro2 and it's an expensive device so
naturally you want to be able to protect
it it closes with a magnet like so and
you just slide it out like this and I
accidentally turned it on there now the
touch pro2 has a chrome ring around the
edge which is quite nice if you turn
over to the back there's no shiny black
coating which means that you don't have
to worry about fingerprints at all on
the back it's actually got a metallic
shiny glossy silver coating here and
there's a texture in the center and then
a piece of almost aluminum here very
nice looking device the screen is 3.6
inches diagonal and actually it's only
point two inches smaller than the Touch
HD they actually hat feel about the same
size so basically think about the touch
pro2 kind of like the touch HD but with
a slide-out keyboard in fact we thought
that this may be called the touch HD pro
but HTC decided to call it the touch
pro2
so let's get a little bit closer and go
around the device so up here at the top
we have the status light next to the
light sensor and the front-facing video
camera which of course you can't use in
the u.s. because networks don't support
it but in Europe that's not the case
down here we have no d-pad but we have
the zoom slider which uses resistive
screen technology and that can be used
when you're in photos or an opera moe
and not really that many other places
down here we have some hardware buttons
call start and call end and call end
also goes home and then the start menu
button here and an okay or back button
there so let's go over to the side here
we have a volume up and down rocker it's
very similar to that on the touch
diamond2 same place a little bit thicker
going over to the bottom we have HTC zxt
USB port which works with all of your
mini or mini USB plugs which is good we
have microphone number one of two and
I'm going to show you the second one in
a second it's quite interesting now the
stylus in the touch pro2 is not magnetic
but it does automatically turn on the
screen as you see there now other HTC
devices last generation had magnetic
style ice so if you look at the touch HD
and you try to bring it in close it
sucks it right in if you look at the
touch pro2 and you bring it close it
sucks it right in but not the case with
the diamond too and the pro tube which i
think is a sad omission so let's go
around the other side i'm here we have
the second microphone and this
microphone is used in conjunction with
the first microphone to provide noise
cancellation when you put the device in
straighttalk mode now let me explain
straight talk mode so the idea here is
that you're on a phone call and maybe
you're in a boardroom or you're in a
meeting and you want to put the phone on
a conference call mode or speakerphone
mode so you turn over the device and
automatically the device with the
accelerometer knows that's been turned
over and suddenly it turns into a
speakerphone and it uses two microphones
to do noise cancellation and it also has
two speakers one here and one here which
helps to make it louder so that it
actually functions like a conference
room
speakerphone we're going to talk more
about how well this works in the in the
review coming up soon okay so I just
want to quickly demonstrate the Straight
Talk feature right now I'm on the call
with someone and I'm gonna turn over the
phone and you see a little light the
device vibrates Chris can you hear me do
I sound clear excellent and as I
mentioned there's a microphone button
here you just press that it turns red
he can't hear me right now can you hear
me now alright thanks for the demo Chris
and on the top we have the standby
button continue continuing on the back
we have a 3.2 megapixel camera here with
no flash unfortunately below that is the
mute button so another feature of this
Straight Talk
speakerphone feature if the phone is on
its back and you want to say something
quietly and not hear the party that's on
the phone here you just tap on the mute
button it'll mute and you'll see a
little light on there and press it again
to turn off mute taking off the back
cover we see that the behind the 1500
milliamp hour battery is the SIM card
slot and unfortunately they put the
micro sd holder under the battery cover
so if you want to quickly swap out your
your micro SD card you have to take off
the battery cover which is kind of
annoying but not too big of a deal ok so
let's talk about the keyboard the
keyboard on the touch pro2 is totally
different than it was on the previous
generation touch pros so if you look at
the titan ii for example the keyboard is
in a symmetrical row pretty much with
all the keys being spaced evenly apart
and that sort of thing if you look at
the touch pro 6s err to that we have a
similar layout which was good and it was
it was easy to use it was a good
keyboard nice and spacious
but HTC has taken it to the next level
on the touch pro2 the keys now are in an
offset pattern and what that means is
that it's more ergonomic kind of like a
keyboard on a desktop or a laptop the
keys are much larger the surface area is
just immense for people that have large
sized hands this is going to be
excellent for them this keyboard is
effortless and you're gonna see in a
minute I'm going to type some things and
it feels so good the only problem is
that there's a lot of finger travel
because it's so large but again people
with large fingers or even medium-sized
fingers are going to appreciate this so
let me try typing something here
and keep in mind that I've only been
playing with this for a few hours so I
can tell you that it feels really good
when you type and and having the
dedicated number row up top is really
helpful let's take a look at what else
we have on the keyboard while we're down
here we have a button that goes right
into messaging we have we have a link
that goes to the web if you press
function and that key and there is a way
to silence the phone and go page up page
down and if you press the function
button you get a little light right here
and if you press the caps lock button
you'll get a light there you can keep
them both on if you want and a lot of
people are asking about how this feels
in hand and in the pocket because if you
remember the original touch pro was very
thick and the touch probe for that we'll
call it the Titan 2 it went by million
different names was even thicker it was
basically a brick well fortunately the
touch pro2 is considerably thinner than
both of those devices HTC made the
device taller and a little bit wider
which I think allowed them to spread out
the electronics and not make it so deep
so in hand it does have heft to it and
does feel it does have some significant
weight to it which isn't a bad thing but
it definitely feels a lot thinner then
does the touch pro or the Titan 2 and in
the pocket it slips nicely in the pocket
because it's the shape of a because it's
very tall and not too thick so that's it
for the hardware tour on the HTC Touch
pro2
we'll be back soon with a software tour
and a full review be sure to check us
