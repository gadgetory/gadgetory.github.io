the month of May new market studies show
the top players in the smartphone
business and have you broken your
iPhone's display lately because apple
will fix it but for attacks I'm hi meri
beta and I'd be willing to pay top
dollar for home delivery of coffee this
is out daily let's start stay
off with the product releases toshiba
has brought us three new excite tablets
even though they've never been able to
excite any of us to buy any of these
tablets in the past but these three
models are kind of interesting they run
Android 4.2 point2 and one of them even
has stylaz recognition so links down
below for the full description of each
of these products for you to probably
ignore anyway intel has been another
company does not really succeeded in the
mobile space but they're still trying
and they've got two new processors for
the mobile business one being the
merrifield processor for smartphones and
the Bay trial T I'm not kidding that's
the name Bay trial T for tablets being
unique in its own way and well how
serious is until lately when it comes to
mobile devices well the samsung galaxy
tab 3 10.1 and i know the name is a
mouthful is now running an intel atom
processor even though they make their
own processors at samsung so it could be
that things might be getting good for
entelechy now let's talk about the
smartphone market contar has now
released their quarter trends and as it
turns out android still remain supreme
at fifty two percent of the smartphone
market then we've got iOS at forty two
percent which is actually growing in
comparison to the same period last year
and then we've got windows phone it's
actually grown into five percent on a
four percent which is actually great sad
news for blackberry as its dropped all
the way down 2.7% from a four percent
last year so who are you cheering for
here leave us a comment moving over to
HTC the company grew twenty six percent
in revenue after the launch of the HTC
One in the month of April but may has
proven to be much better with a
forty-eight percent growth in revenue
which is outstanding five million units
of the HTC One have apparently been sold
even though we haven't really been able
to confirm this but the sad news is that
now raise the price of the HTC One to
match the google edition of the same
phone which is rather unfortunate but we
don't blame them I mean if the phone is
actually proven to be a success then
yeah demand that's the way it works and
finally for the sort of interesting news
of the day Apple is now replacing broken
displays of iPhones and their genius bar
at any apple store which is both good
and bad it's good because well for 150
bucks they'll do everything for you
right there which is close to the price
of a display on eBay that's not
necessarily official or genuine but the
bad part is that in the past for two
hundred dollars they give you a brand
new phone right there instead of just
replacing the crack display and I still
don't know if they keep the policy of
the twenty dollars for a new phone but
maybe think about it it's kind of a deal
for many people that just don't want to
do things themselves and we consider how
much it costs you to replace the display
on any Samsung Galaxy smartphone which
is like 250 to 300 dollars just for the
display and then you do it yourself well
this is kind of a deal but that leads me
to the question of the day how much have
you paid to replace a broken display um
in my particular case will i paid the
Apple tax I've paid the twenty dollars
and they've given me a brand new phone
but leave us a comment down below what
have you done whenever you've broken the
device or broken a display and of course
for an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet all mushy follow us on
