a little beefier than what your
smartphone's packin out of the box but
wired speakers can be a dorky mess and
big sound often requires big power with
the portable self powered wireless
charging speaker accessory maker Zen's
looks to change the game at least for
those with Qi compatible smartphones but
is the Zen's wireless charging speaker
compelling enough to capture your
capital at the cash wrap i'm michael
fisher with pocket down let's find out
the most surprising thing about this
product is probably its size compared
with something like the JBL charging
dock that launched alongside the Lumia
920 in 2012 the Zen's charger is quite
portable that's not to say it's
lightweight you definitely wouldn't want
to cart it around in a pocket and it
likely qualifies as a weapon in some
jurisdictions but it wouldn't feel too
burdensome in a backpack or a beach bag
the unit's design is simple the speaker
grille is a wraparound affair with the
controls situated at the end caps
volume and track controls microphone and
Status LED on one side power switch
micro USB and aux-in on the other the
upper surface serves as the landing pad
for the single induction charging coil
and the NFC tap point is on the bottom
nestled beneath that unobtrusive design
sits a very powerful set of speakers and
seriously they're loud
setup is as simple as tapping an
nfc-enabled phone to the tap point on
the bottom to initiate the bluetooth
pairing process or you can do it
manually if you prefer the LED flashes
while it's seeking a connection and it
holds solid when the link is established
Windows Phone 8 can be a little finicky
in this department our Lumia 1020 was
hesitant to reconnect if it lost the
link but we had no such trouble with the
Moto X then speaking of nokia the
placement of the coil in the 1020 s
wireless charging shell means it
requires special positioning atop the
dock in order to charge is something not
required of devices like the Nexus 5 so
the ease or difficulty of finding that
sweet spot will depend on what device
you carry with the 40 500 milliamp hour
battery powering everything we expected
fair endurance but nothing like what the
doc delivered we were able to get eight
solid hours out of the unit streaming
music via bluetooth at medium volume
while also actively topping up the Lumia
1020 S battery via Qi so the doc only
died after an entire workday of
listening to Pandora and Spotify and
even then it left the Lumia fully
charged that's outstanding performance
and it makes us wish the chief standard
was supported by more devices that's one
of the downsides of this accessory you
need to be in the Qi Club to use the
charging capability there are no other
wireless charging options and the USB
port is a one-way street
the shared volume and track control keys
aren't the most intuitive around the
dock is pretty slow to recharge 6 hours
from dry to full using USB and probably
the biggest downside is the speaker's
tendency to rattle at certain
frequencies in bass ear songs
just like on the JBL powerup dock it's
loud enough here to be annoying
especially since the rest of the sound
is so rich and amazing finally it all
eventually comes down to money doesn't
it and to be honest 100 bucks is a tough
pill to swallow but when you consider
that the larger less mobile JBL product
cost $300 at launch it makes a bit more
sense especially when you also factor in
the unplugged charge ability and the out
standing battery-life so if you've got a
smartphone with Chi capability or one
that can accommodate a chi compatible
case and you want to be the king or
queen of the beach parties this summer
the Zen's wireless portable dock has a
great combination of wow factor and
practicality at a fair price if you want
to see more from Zen's folks we have two
more Zen's products on the review docket
one is a wireless charger for home the
other wireless charger for the car so
