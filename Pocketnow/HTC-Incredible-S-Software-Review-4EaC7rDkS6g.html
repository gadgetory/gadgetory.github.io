pocketnow.com and this is a software
review of the HTC Incredible S let's get
to it now again this is an unlocked
european smartphone that happens to work
on t-mobile 3G network here in the USA
you can buy it unlock for about six
hundred and forty dollars from Negri
electronics again the thought is that
this is coming to Verizon as the Droid
Incredible 2 we'll have to wait and see
if that actually happens but it's quite
possible at this moment in time so let's
jump into this let's talk about the
software we're gonna go right into
quadrant standard and run a speed test
and you know we're actually gonna
compare this head-to-head with the
desire hd this is actually the inspire
4G but we're going to call it the Desire
HD because it's the same device now the
reason we're going to compare this is to
make a point the designer HD is HTC's
last generation 2010 high-end smartphone
the inspire s is HTC's new high-end
smartphone for 2011 or at least that's
the only information that we have from
HTC at this time it's very likely that
HTC is going to come out with something
much higher end at CTIA called the
pyramid the dual-core processor a higher
resolution screen but we just don't have
confirmation on that so we have to give
HTC the benefit of the doubt that the
inspire s is is one of the best devices
they're gonna have in 2011 we go to
system information you're gonna see that
these devices have the exact same
internals they are the same device so if
we scroll down to CPU we have the same
arm arm v7 processor that's the Qualcomm
Snapdragon frequency is 1024 megahertz
everything else is the same
the bogo MIPS for some reason shows as a
different number that's another
measurement of CPU speed but because
these CPUs kind of scale up they scale
down depending on what you're doing you
don't always get the same measurement
memory is exactly the same we've got 768
megabytes
although user-accessible is about 630
there's 8 megabytes more available on
the desire hd and everything else going
down the same the GPU is the same the
Adreno 205 opengl
SCM 1.1 and so on and so forth so this
is these are basically the same device
so if we run the benchmark we should get
probably the same results although it
would be nice to see the incredible has
to come out with better results since it
was released a full year later let's see
what happens okay here are the results
the incredible s is no slouch scoring a
benchmark score 1400 over here the
desire hd is much higher at 1600 the the
point I'm trying to make here is that
it's kind of surprising that a device
that came out a year later and that was
sort of HTC's high-end has scored a
lower benchmarking score than the last
generation phone again this may not be
fair because HTC isn't done yet for this
year and we're likely to see a better
phone come out at CTIA but it's just an
interesting observation here in terms of
day to day performance as you're going
to see in this video the incredible ass
is quite good it's not as fast as this
Desire HD opening programs instead of
being instant I have about a point to
five-second delay
but let's actually compare these
side-by-side in doing some other things
so we're going to do some web browser
speed comparisons here and let's see
what we have we're going to just load
the desktop pocket now and I'm going to
zoom in over here we've got plugins set
to on demand so that they aren't going
to show up actually we wanted to get to
the desktop version here okay so here
they're both loading the same page and
we're going to move around on the page
and see which one performs better and do
some speed tests from there so it's a
loading on the incredible s okay let's
move down quickly looks good looks good
both of them look good
pinch-to-zoom quite smooth on both let's
click on this link at the same time the
screen on the incredible west as you can
tell is much more clear and crisp
both of these are set to automatic
screen brightness but the incredible s
just has a lot more clarity okay so it
looks like the Desire HD finished
slightly faster although that might have
not been fair I mean they were so close
let's actually go to a longer page will
go to engadget.com and do the slick
scroll test
to see which of these can keep up the
best okay let's do the flip scroll test
on Engadget that's a very long page we
want to see if the phone can keep up so
we're gonna flick very quickly
no checkerboard on the desire hd flip
very quickly on the incredible ice no
checkerboard very good so these are
exhibiting a similar similar level of
performance let's zoom in here we're
gonna click on this link at the same
time if possible boom
again the incredible s actually finished
slightly faster there so a very good web
browsing performance are the incredible
s compared to the desire hd despite its
scoring a little bit lower in the
benchmarks so let's take that off the
scene here and talk a little bit more
about the incredible s of course we've
got the button rotation which we talked
about in the last video the problem of
the button rotation is that they leave
the buttons looking a little bit
low-quality if we tilt the device
slightly you can see how they're getting
brighter now they get dimmer the button
on the right is the most of them the
button on the left is the least amount
of strange and of course the buttons
will rotate there okay so let's go back
to the home screen and talk about HTC
Sense now HTC hasn't made any changes
except for the addition of one widget to
the newer version of sense they're going
to upgrade sense when these devices be
incredible as the desire as the Wildfire
s that they announced at Mobile World
Congress get Gingerbread 2.3 so right
now this is the same version of sense
that you've seen on the desire hd on the
legend on a lot of phones that are out
there and and quite simply we get our
seven home screens we get leap you've
seen this a million times before
although here's a little feature and
leap that you may not know about you can
actually move around home screens like
so kind of cool to know about they don't
make it immediately obvious then we can
go and add some widgets and let me show
you the the widget selection here I'm
going to show you every one but just
kind of browse through some of these so
we've got bookmarks of course there are
72 two widgets here the desire hd has 71
and I'm going to show you which one is
new so we've got a lot of really high
quality beautiful HTC widgets that you
can expect to have it's we're going to
go back and let me just show you
immediately the one that is new it is
called navigation or navigate so we
click on that this one is new right here
press select and then you can choose
which of your footprints you want to
navigate to let's try to go to the
Statue of Liberty click done and this
way you have a quick link to navigate to
somewhere right from your home screen
pretty cool let's say you go to the same
place all the time and you want to
navigate somewhere you pull this up tap
on Statue of Liberty and it's going to
bring up the HTC navigation program that
wants me to turn on the GPS satellites
in order to get it working here we go a
little bit choppy on the video there
we're using HTC's navigation program so
it's getting directions and flying out
and here we go it shows us the how to
get there
pretty cool anyhow let's move on so this
is the car panel which will allow you to
navigate from your phone free guidance
very cool stuff here ok so let's go into
the program tray here now the program
tray and the new version of sense will
actually have three sliders along the
bottom that let you filter between
favorite applications downloaded
applications and all applications
there's not much you can do with the
program tray although there are a couple
of options you can go into list mode you
can you can share a particular app if
you want to or you can sort them
alphabetically by date or by date
including the most recent and the oldest
which is really handy because then you
can put the apps that you've downloaded
right at the top so you can get a record
right when you pop pop into the program
trail you can see the apps that you've
downloaded most recently so let's look
down the list of some of these apps that
come in on the device yet obviously the
top two rows are apps that I've
downloaded so we've got basic stuff here
we've got the navigation panel you saw
comes with Amazon mp3
let's see flashlights always good FM
radio the HTC hub you can actually hook
this up to htcsense.com
so that you can remotely manage your
phone it's really cool you just plug in
your your username and password you set
it up on your phone and then you can
locate your phone anywhere in the world
you can have your phone ring you could
have it display a lot screen message or
you can remotely wipe all the data if
you leave it in the back seat of a cab
car and you're never going to get it
back we've got the HTC
application which we've seen before and
this wants you to login with your with
your htcsense.com account it'll suggest
applications for you kind of a good way
to discover new apps and of course HTC
hub should do the same thing it asks you
to login that will give you access to
wallpapers skins ringtones and other
assets from HTC servers we've got the
music program this does have that SRS
capability built in which is the Dolby
labs functionality it's actually two
different things don't be labs in SRS or
two different things but what happens is
that when you play a song you can switch
up here to SRS it looks like there's no
Dolby labs only SRS so SRS makes it
sound slightly better if you're
listening with headphones turning on SRS
will make the bass sound boom ear and
the highest sound crisp ear
so just something to consider HTC is
including that with all of its new
smartphones
of course there's a nice cover flow here
but of course this is standard for all
the HTC music applications really nice
animation we've got HTC peep included
quick look up things like that whether
YouTube's Wi-Fi hotspot built right in
so that you can share your connection
now what about data speeds well this
will do three 3G on t-mobile in fact
let's really quick turn off the Wi-Fi so
that we can actually do some real-time
benchmarking of the HSDPA speeds that
you're getting this doesn't do the HSPA+
higher speed internet access that you
get on some of the four GT mobile phones
but the speeds are quite good as we're
going to see that wasn't a good run but
let's do a run now we've got three out
of four bars let's see what we get
running the speed test here 728
millisecond ping and here we go this is
very typical of t-mobile's 3G network
about 2.9 megabits per second down and a
solid 1.7 1.8 megabits per second up and
that's the final final verdict there we
go over to the results panel you can see
all the other tests I've run ignore
anything with a little Wi-Fi logo so
three down to point four two point one
two
one one point six two point nine so you
get pretty fast data speeds on this so
it's definitely a worthy device of tea
bubbles 3G network with with pretty
pretty strong data speeds there of
course also with HTC Sense the new
version you get the improved
notification shade which will actually
include your your last used application
so you can either use that to toggle
between apps or a tavern road of the
poem button to go into an app that
you've recently visited and of course
many other applications are adorned with
HTC Sense so we go into the mail
application this has the you know the
HTC Sense interface which is great
because the stock Android mail
application annoyingly puts the compose
mail button behind the Menu key but on
HTC a sense they put it right out in
front so it's easy to access also these
sliders are configurable if you tap and
hold on one of them you can actually
bring down different ones to the bottom
slider or remove them and have kind of a
minimal design like I have here and this
goes through a lot of different programs
like contacts and phone and other things
like that it's a really good experience
and the camera should add has those
on-screen effects so if we go to the
little blonde over here we can change it
to Distortion you can move around your
finger a lot of other photobooth like
effects that you can choose from right
on-screen and have them be be rendered
sort of in real time we're going to talk
more about photo samples and the camera
the 720p recording capability of the
Incredible s in the full review but as a
little preview so far we're impressed by
the imaging capability of this phone so
that concludes the software review of
the HTC Incredible S again we know what
to expect on an HTC device there's no
real surprises at this point they
haven't upgraded their version of sense
for this particular device there's a
little bit unfortunate but HTC Sense is
very mature it's a great Android
interface a lot of people agree that
it's the best Android interface the
device is fast it does good data speeds
although it's strangely not as fast
the last generation HDC high-end
smartphone but in day-to-day operation
it is generally fast bouncing between
applications using the 768 megabytes of
RAM allows for pretty fast operation
nothing incredible but but certainly it
performs quite well so if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
