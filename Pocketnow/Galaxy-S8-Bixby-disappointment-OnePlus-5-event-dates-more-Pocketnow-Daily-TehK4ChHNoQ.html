disappointed with its own delay with the
launch of Dixie on the s8 the BlackBerry
key one has met an extraordinary demand
according to the company it seems that
we already have a date for the one plus
five I'm high memory that I and after
seven hours driving the last thing I
want to hear is how yellow my shirt is
this is out daily the official
news do they have to do with product
announcements we've been waiting for a
new Moto Z for a while we're still not
getting anything but a new z to play but
if you remember is the premium mid
Ranger variant we're pretty much just
getting a snapdragon 66 processor and
actually the battery is much smaller
than the previous one at just three
thousand milliamp hours we do get a
couple of new moto monster you can learn
about on the link of the description and
all we have to do now is wait for the
next moto Z to at least what we see our
enhancements in the fingerprint scanner
design is pretty much the same and
everything else one of the biggest
questions that most of us have is when
are we going to get the next generation
one plus there is this banner that we
still can't confirm if it's real or not
but apparently it's teasing a date for
June 15 so set your calendars hopefully
that will be the day when we get the
next flagship color now one company that
is not playing around with product
announcement dates is honor because they
don't want to say that they belong to
wall way for those of you waiting for
the honor nine and I am actually on that
list of people that want to see the
successor to the honor eight apparently
June 12th is going to be the date for
the event we already have full
invitations and everything and let's
just see if the company is going to keep
on with the same legacy or if we're
getting something completely different
can't wait for those of you that we're
thinking that the BlackBerry key one was
not going to sell we don't have official
figures yet as a the launch was pretty
much yesterday but the company has been
teasing that it is receiving a crazy
amount of demand for this phone
particularly in the United States it
seems that there are some cases where
the phone has sold out in stores again
we don't have official information we
have heard this directly from the
company though and I don't know I know
that some people are not crazy about
that keyboard I just love that film
very light so hey great for you bet
blackberries and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with Samsung the galaxy f8 and the lack
of the full support for bixby we've been
waiting for this launch for a while not
necessarily because we want fix peak of
work but just because we wish to either
get away to disable it or to see if this
is actually superior to any other
artificial intelligence assistance out
there as it turns out this product
internally was opposed to launch in May
and that hasn't been the case according
to trusted sources that might not launch
until July but anyways leading me to the
questions today just tell me for those
of you that have bought the sa-2 for
those of you that will want to get the
phone is a big be a deal-breaker for you
have you been waiting for this launch in
my case I just want to switch to turn it
off and I mean especially not with all
the hacks that are out there but leave
us a comment down below we love to know
your opinion
