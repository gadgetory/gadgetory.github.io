5 event HTC sends out other invites for
their September 19th event and the bad
piggies now get their own game I'm hi
Mary better yep this is poking out daily
see what do we tell you Apple has just
sent out press invites for their Apple
September 12 events in San Francisco and
even though they don't tell what they're
going to be launching at the event well
they've got this big 5 under the number
12 so yeah it's going to be called the
iphone 5 there's no need for more
speculation there the question is what
are we going to get apples rumored
next-generation product is definitely
going to be a game changer when compared
to current generation iphones we hope so
let rumor mill begin now HTC has also
sent out press invites for an event in
new york city on September 19th and
everything seems to be about Windows
Phone the event is dubbed come join HTC
and see what's next so could it be that
HTC has finally opened their eyes to the
Windows Phone 8 operating system and now
they're going to push it like real hard
HTC has been rumored to be working on a
1080p 5-inch display device so hey all
of us are waiting for Titan 3 bring it
on and finally after spending years
throwing birds at pigs I think even the
guys at rovio got bored because they're
now working on releasing a new product
that's a cross platform game called bad
piggies and hopefully this will be more
than just throwing pigs and birds now
the game is slated to be launched on
September 27th for almost every platform
in the market so make sure you stay
tuned or stay angry now even though both
nokia and motorola events are slated for
later today we ran into a couple of
rumors of what know Kim might be working
on first of all the bad news is that it
seems that Nokia is working on a windows
phone 7.8 under power device that's
hopefully for the emerging market and
has nothing to do with this event let's
just hope on that and second it seems
that there are leaks of an old nokia
lata me go device with a slide-out
keyboard that was just a concept than
never released the device had the same
nokia n9 which was later lumia 800
design though with a slide-out keyboard
and looked really slick so hopefully
that concept will eventually reach new
Lumias and who knows probably we will be
seeing that today and finally a video
that was leaked recently shows off the
blackberry 10 L Series device that's the
Slade only device without a keyboard
that will probably be released before
the world ends and even though bb10 does
seem snappy i have heard of publications
that talk about it and say that it's
really good but sadly i'm just concerned
about the lack of originality i mean
just look at that thing it looks like
the spitting image of an iphone i mean
i-i don't know if room understands this
but even if they switch the icons on the
status bar from one side to the next
that won't save them from a patent
lawsuit over design like samsung just
happened and well that leads me to the
question of the day do you even care
about blackberry anymore and if you do i
mean do you even care about this bb10
device if not even rim knows when
they're gonna launch it leave us a
comment down below now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
high never be better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
