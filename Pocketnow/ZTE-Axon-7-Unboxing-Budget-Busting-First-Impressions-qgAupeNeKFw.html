market for budget-busting flagship
phones is heating up fast the
competition surrounding this $400 price
point is intense and ZTE is turning up
the heat with the axon 7 the claim here
is that we can have a truly compromise
free flagship handset at a mid-range err
price but before we can test that claim
we have to get it out of the box and
what a box it is this is really pretty
packaging with some great attention paid
to small details moving the phone out of
the way in addition to the cable and
charger the axon comes with a
nice-looking set of earbuds and a
plastic screen protector
I'm unfortunately terrible at putting on
screen protectors and the guards
supplied doesn't quite reach the edges
of the front glass so I probably won't
leave this on little touches like a
rubber bumper around the SIM card PIN
tool and a USB C to micro USB adapter
are also appreciated actually looking at
the axon there's an overall vibe here
which recalls phones like the HTC One m8
an all-metal phone body with
front-facing speakers and some
familiar-looking in 10 aband
and now this 5.5 inch screen is a quad
HD AMOLED display covered in Gorilla
Glass 4 the axon is powered by a
Qualcomm 820 chipset with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 64gb bytes of storage with a
micro SD card slot to add more a 3,250
milliamp power battery is backed up by a
USB type-c port and quick charge 3.0 the
rear camera is a 20 megapixel shooter
paired up with optical image
stabilization phase detection autofocus
and has options to shoot h.265
compression for UHD video these are
absolutely monster specs at this price
point the initial boot up was one of the
faster launches we've seen and the set
up process got us through Wi-Fi scanning
and account login pretty quick the rear
mounted fingerprint sensor is easily
reached by folks of all hand sizes and
though it's not the fastest we've tested
it was easy to train it gets the job
done well enough getting to the home
screens the axon launcher recalls some
of the tweaks and customizations we
enjoyed from TouchWiz and cents how
shortcuts are organized in the
notification shade or the grid spacing
for your home screens or options to
change animations a handful of gestures
are available to wake the screen or fire
up the flash
in the hand it's a solid slab of foam
which gives off a fantastic first
impression it's a pretty complete
experience out of the box nicely
accessorized and the price point really
can't be be we're left wondering where
we might find some compromises how does
the axon perform against more expensive
smartphone options is the Dolby audio a
hit or just more hype can the camera
keep up with some of the truly great
options we've reviewed this year well
you'll just have to stay tuned for our
future coverage on the axon 7 coming
