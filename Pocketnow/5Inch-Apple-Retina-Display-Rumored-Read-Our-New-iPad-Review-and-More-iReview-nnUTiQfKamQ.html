device begin to surface our full review
of Apple's new iPad is live and speaking
of Retina display how are things working
there for you
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm Heine with
pocketnow.com and welcome to the pocket
now I review the show we go through all
this week school and they're not so cool
this has the world of Apple's iOS
devices let's start this week off with a
cool let's start this week off
differently going through our coverage
first of all make sure you catch
brandon's full review of apple's a new
ipad which ended up landing five stars
out of five there's a lot of really
great video cons and on the reasons why
this device landed this rating now for
you and I that know Brandon it's kind of
tough to get this guy to give any device
five stars out of five so hit the link
in the description to see why and well
second make sure you catch our video
comparison of the third generation iPad
last year's iPad 2 and even the first
generation iPad if you're debating
whether to upgrade or not or whether
which device to buy either from eBay the
first generation iPad or iPad 2 or the
new iPad watch the video to help you
make up your mind and finally make sure
you catch Michael Fisher's recent round
of editorials going through Apple's new
iPad one of them even talks about why a
lot of technologies that surround the
new iPad aren't really ready for the
Retina display graphics make sure you
hit the link in the description there's
a lot of discussion going on in that
editorial so leave your comment with us
and tell us what you think about
Michael's editorial and speaking of
iPads IGN recently benchmarked the new
iPad and even the iPad 2 in comparison
to the assist transformer prime with its
beautiful quad core Tegra 3 processor
and they even threw in the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 in that mix not sure
what they did that but the results were
literally incredible because well even
the iPad to beat the Tegra 3 processor
and the issues transformer prime now a
lot of us believe that this has to do
with the way that Apple has optimized
iOS
to work with their a 5 and a 5 X
processors in comparison to the way that
things work in Android because obviously
issues has there are things to do and
then Android 4.0 is built by somebody
else there's no real full control over
the whole experience so I feel I could
probably have to do with some software
tweaking but so far hey Apple was kind
of right probably not as right as they
mentioned in the keynote but yes the
iPad 2 and the new iPad are faster than
the Tegra 3 at least in graphics now do
me a favor don't hold your breath on
this one but it seems that new rumors
have Apple working on a Fallot repeat
after me
phablet if there's even a word for five
inch tablets but that's right rumors
have it that Apple is working on one em
hey when the first generation iPad was
launched Apple had a lot of prototypes
before they decided on their final model
so it could be the case that they're
trying out a 5 inch Retina display to
see where it goes the biggest question
is will this be a tablet only that
wouldn't be a phablet or would it also
be a smartphone that would be kind of
interesting though we really don't see
Apple going in that direction
they haven't even wanted to leave their
3.5 inch display for the original first
generation iPhone so we'll see now
moving on to jailbreak land it seems
that the Apple TV just got a jailbreak
recently an you know it's only a matter
of time before once i OS device gets yel
broken the rest of them start falling
like flies but sadly part 2 G came on
record to state that they're still weeks
away from getting these jailbreaks out
to the new iPad and also iOS 5.1 so
weeks also equals two weeks and three
weeks so let's hope you don't take that
long now before we get to the not so
cool section gets this Apple is just
displaying why their new iPad doesn't
fully charge 200 percent all the time
even though you're still getting in a
hundred percent battery indicator on
your device according to them you have
to wait a little longer before you
inject your device from the plug which
is kind of weird but still I can't get
over the fact that my device takes seven
hours to charge that's pretty much
insane it's kind of interesting
nobody has come up with a new sort of
what 20 watt charger that works with the
iPad or something like that or even
Apple Apple should even be giving those
away for free probably 30 watts or
something I don't care but they need to
figure that out but it seems that people
are still getting even 13.5 hours of use
on LTE variants of the new iPad whenever
they turn off LTE so not everything's
bad that's the only reason why this is
still in the cool section okay so that
does it for the cool let's continue on
with the not so cool and first of all
antenna gate it seems that you've
already won your 15 bucks that we talked
about weeks ago all you have to do is
visit the website for you to get your
money 15 bucks you could probably even
get a case at the Apple Store
I sure what they plan it to with that
but if you order your device before
February 2011 of last year yeah last
year well you can just go pick up your
15 dollars which is pretty much the same
you could pay for a meal and then aside
from that while Australians are
complaining because Apple's recent
publicity says that you get 4G LTE on
the iPad but obviously they don't get
that in their country so it seems that
they just file a couple of lawsuits and
Apple is offering them a refund what
Apple doesn't understand this that
people went to buy a tablet with 4G LTE
if they had if they wanted the money
they wouldn't have got to go pay for it
but they want to pay for it because they
wanted that so stop advertising
something you can't give that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Jaime better remember to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
