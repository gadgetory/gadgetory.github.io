if the iPhone eight is a worthy upgrade
some people still have the iPhone 7 and
feel that this is just an iPhone 7s and
then there's the irony that you can
still buy both from Cupertino at the
moment with the 7 costing slightly less
money it's only fair for us to put them
head-to-head on a comparison to see just
how similar they really are I'm highly
meditative a tie with pocket now and
this is iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 7
brought to you by deep brand
let's get the obvious out of the way
first the iPhone 7 is more like the
iPhone 6s s and for the iPhone 8 let's
just add an extra s to that this is the
fourth year in a row that Apple iterates
this design and if you went for the
matte black or Space Gray Varian's I
chose they're almost indistinguishable
from a distance you have to get close to
the iPhone 8 - notice that there is
glass on the back instead of aluminum
that the color is more of a darker tone
of gray instead of black and that the
Apple logo and iPhone texture now
attended chrome like in the old days
dimension wise the iPhone ADA's are here
larger than the 7 in every way fractions
of a millimeter taller wider and thicker
though 10 grams heavier and you notice
that the moment you hold them side by
side the alumina on the 7 is less prone
to fingerprints than the glass on the 8
but at the expense of being more
slippery when handled I still prefer
aluminum because it's one less part that
breaks in case of a fall but if wireless
charging is your thing only the glass on
the 8 can achieve that and since we've
begun to discuss features and
specifications the 8 obviously has all
the newer toys the a11 Bionic follows
the latest and more efficient 10
nanometer process versus 60 nano meter
on the 810 fusion Ram is reportedly the
same 2 gigabytes if you're buying today
the iPhone 7 comes with 32 or 128
gigabytes of storage the iPhone 8 comes
with 64 or 256 gigabytes both devices
share ip67 water and dust resistance as
well but the only place where the 7 wins
at least in numbers is because it's
battery is 8 percent larger for content
consumption both devices support a
retina HD IPS LCD that supports the p3
color gamut the iPhone 8 wins again by
bringing true tone technology of the
iPad pro which adapts the displayed tone
to the lighting surrounding it the
iPhone 8 also has slightly more powerful
stereo speakers than the 7 but I
recommend watching wands real audio
review for a full comparison on that
in software there's really nothing to
compare here both devices run Iowa's 11
and this is one of those cases where
absolutely everything the iPhone eight
can do the iPhone seven can do as well
we have a separate video detailing the
improvements to this new operating
system so I'd rather not for you with
the basics gliding through menus and
launching basic applications perform
about the same on both devices I notice
speedier performance and hard core stuff
like restoring the iPhone eight from a
backup but that's just about it even for
things like gameplay the iPhone 7 is no
slouch when compared to Apple's latest
and greatest wear I have noticed a
significant difference is in battery
life the ten nanometer process on the
a11 is clearly a more efficient ship
even when running on a slightly smaller
battery the iPhone 8 has been the first
ever
regular-sized iPhone that I've been able
to use for a full day without the need
to top up by 4:00 p.m. and listen I said
the only one the iPhone 7 and even the
seventh was have proven to be
disappointments in this department as
you'll notice on our after the buzz
videos and then where I haven't really
noticed significant differences is in
the camera I highly suggest you watch
wands real camera review he actually
focuses this video more on making it a
comparison between the iPhone 8 plus and
the iPhone 7 plus and the differences
are negligible for all that Apple
mentioned that it had refreshed the
sensors that's really not visible here
don't get me wrong though this is not a
bad thing this just means that both the
8 and the 7 are great at photography
video recording is where things are
different but not when you record a
regular video it's when you tax the
iPhone a to its maximum capabilities
like being able to record 4k at 60
frames per second or being able to
record slow-motion video at 1080p at 240
frames per second thinks that the iPhone
7 can't do and not even the camera that
I'm using to film this comparison either
and I think the camera experience is the
best way to conclude this comparison so
be looking for major differences between
the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 might be
disappointed that there aren't that's
what the iPhone tennis for and if you're
wondering why the iPhone 8 exists that's
because I know a significant amount of
people that like the iPhone as it is
they want the latest and greatest iPhone
but they don't want to lose touch ID or
even the rest of the experience that
they're used to if you already have the
iPhone 7 upgrading doesn't really make
sense but if you're in the market for a
new iPhone and don't want to wait for
the 10 I would highly recommend the
iPhone Nate more than the iPhone 7
simply because it's newer hardware it
performs better when it comes to battery
life and while Apple supports a newer
phone for a longer period of time and
regardless of what you choose
fingerprints and smudges are always
going to be a given the brand skins will
eliminate those fingerprints and add
some grip to your upcoming iPhone 8 or
any iPhone for that matter
