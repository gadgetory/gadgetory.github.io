galaxy note5 noga seems to be returning
to the smartphone business and sort of
and facebook seems to think that it
knows how to build a digital assistant
I'm hi Annette iveta and the view think
of it by 2016 Facebook will most likely
be delivering your pizza this is bargain
out daily the official news today start
with Google as the company has made its
google nearby services official they
were sort of announced a couple of
months ago but it's not until now that
we know that they exist the api's will
be rolled out with Google Play services
in a way for developers to be able to
use the API to for example help you play
a game with a friend just by being close
to the other which is cool you can also
obviously share information through
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that's really just
the tip of the iceberg we can't wait to
see what the villa birds come up with
this new platform other official news
today have nokia confirming that they
will return to the smartphone business
at first they said no but now after the
whole microsoft be on the right off and
everything the company is just made it
official but there is a catch just like
with the case of the nokia and one
tablet where Foxconn pretty much has to
deal with everything it seems a note get
just wants to lend a company the brand
but it can't apparently do anything
until 2016 it's a little shady to see
what Nokia plan to do going forward but
hopefully they make some announcements
coming soon I mean they have like seven
thousand people they can hire again
right now those of you wondering about
the future of motorola smartphones
famous if tsarev leaks have just pretty
much revealed everything we need to know
about the Moto G starting with the
design of the phone but that's just part
of it most interesting is the fact that
we see different colored trims in
addition to different color backs now
this is a different color fronts for the
Moto G meaning that it could be that
this phone is also going to be getting
some motomaker treatment we don't know
exactly when this will happen but
hopefully it will be soon as the Moto X
is due for a refresh in addition to this
phone as well and for those of you on
the ropes for the galaxy note 5 remember
all those rumors of a possible August
announcement well we've got two very
credible sources claiming two things
number one that it will be announced on
August 12 and the
source claims that it will be launched
on major markets on August fourteenth
two days later now we don't know any
specifics as to which markets these are
or what the price points will be but
this will be really hot if it happened
and finally for the very interesting
rumors of the day it seems that Facebook
is working on its own digital assistant
codenamed Moneypenny for those of you
that like the James Bond movies as it
turns out this is not necessarily going
to be like what we see on Siri or on
Google now apparently what we're getting
here is a service that will allow you to
connect with real people to get real
personal answers from people and it's
really interesting to see this happening
as a digital assistants haven't really
become as popular as companies want them
to be but it does leads me to the
question of the day what digital
assistants do you currently either like
or use in my case I'll tell you this
much I have all three of them Cortana
Siri and Google now and well I use Siri
mostly for reminders but that's pretty
much it i don't really use the services
leave us a comment down below what do

drill if you want to get to those
