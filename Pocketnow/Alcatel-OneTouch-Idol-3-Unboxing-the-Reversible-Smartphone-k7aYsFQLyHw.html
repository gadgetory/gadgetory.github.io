tempt to come with no-frills packaging I
guess Alcatel OneTouch didn't get that
memo
when it sent out press kits this week
i'm michael fisher with PocketNow and
this is our unboxing and first look at
the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 alright
alright so this isn't the packaged
regular buyers are gonna see when they
unbox their Idol 3 it's a press only
preview kit the actual retail box is
much smaller as you'd expect but this
one's more exciting so let's show you
what's inside the slide to unlock switch
doesn't do anything but it's still a
cool effect the path to the phone is a
three leaf layer cake of marketing you
get emphasis on bright calling us a full
HD display loud calling up the JBL
speakers and moments emphasizing the
sony camera sensor open that final flap
and blam finally we get to the phone and
its companion accessory packet well open
up that capsule to find the tiniest
little USB drive ever which has the
press kit on it along with the power
adapter and cables you even get in-ear
headphones bundled in and these will
come in the consumer version and like
the phone's front firing speakers their
JBL branded that's more than we can say
for most phones at this price point
moving on to the phone itself after we
peel off all those labels we're
confronted by a simple rounded gray slab
with chrome accents as a whole it looks
pretty good with the only giveaway to
its lower end status being a few
materials compromises the set and a back
cover really holds on to the remnants of
all that label adhesive and there's a
very visible pixel matrix on the 5.5
inch display as well also at 140 grams
the phone is actually a touch more
massive than the galaxy s6 but because
of its all plastic construction it feels
much lighter and less substantial more
promising are those front firing
surround sound enabled speakers flanking
the display and the 8 megapixel front
facing camera a OT makes a point of
calling out the 13 megapixel resolution
of the rear camera in the literature but
there's no optical stabilization onboard
the battery is just under 3000 milliamp
hours which gives us hope for high
endurance and the software running on
the phone is android 5.0.2 with a
special UI laid on top the whole thing
powered by a Snapdragon 615 processor oh
and yes this is the phone that's
reversible get a phone call and you can
put either end to your ear to take it
the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 will ship
mid-may for a pre-order price of 2
$49.99 unlocked and if you get an order
in before 11:59 p.m. Pacific on April
20th it's $1.99 we'll be testing it in
four separate countries over the coming
weeks so drop us a line in the comments

about what a ot is calling a super phone
at the price of a smart phone for more
