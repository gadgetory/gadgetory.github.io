pretty much the same hardware looking at
the V 30s really the fact that it hasn't
changed it's not necessarily bad
that I don't have and then we've also
got a new platinum silver and then
there's also up this is the LGB 30 which
you already knew this is the new LGV 30s
plus thank you
I'm hi Metairie that I was pocket now
reporting from MWC in Barcelona let's
talk about this brought to you by
invisible shield
I wish I could tell you that there are
significant differences between the be
30 and the B 30s but really pretty much
as we saw in rumors to be 30s is an
upgrade it follows the same theme that
we saw with the LG G 6 plus where we got
some minor speck bumps and the same
hardware in the case of the V 30s we've
got 6 gigabytes of RAM and now options
that start at 128 or 256 gigs of storage
and really the reason why this unit has
a plus is because it has the 256
gigabytes of storage going through the
box and contents really this is the bno
variant so what we have here is your
typical black box this is actually a
production unit that's going to be
available in Korea very soon we've got
the phone front and center under that we
have the sim ejector tool the usual USBC
cable with an adapter this one being
European and we've got the enou
headphones that I've actually praised in
the past that's pretty much it when it
comes to the box and accessories now
other hardware differences really have
to do with the new color options now we
have a Moroccan blue and a platinum gray
our unit is the blue variant and other
than that really the hardware is the
same and LG confirmed we're talking
about the same panel the same camera the
same processor just about everything is
every 30 the company was very specific
this is going to be the way that they're
going to handle smartphones going
forward meaning they will have a
flagship launch and then 6 months down
the line we will be getting an upgrade
that's not necessarily bad it allows
this hardware to stay in the market for
a bit longer
I actually prais'd the hardware of the V
30 and I like the fact that essentials
like the Siksika bytes of RAM are now
being offered from a software
perspective we again have the same LG UI
that were accustomed to most important
are the changes to the camera there is
this new bright mode that mimics the
ultra pixel feature that we saw from HTC
phones where we get a 16 megapixel shot
but the camera is actually using four
times the pixels to generate a larger
one and be able to pull in more light
through that way and really the other is
the fact that the reason why this phone
is being called thinkyou is because this
is a company's new approach to
I that's what they're calling it and it
again follows the brightness settings
where it can notice that it's extremely
dim and accommodate to that and it also
follows on what the Huawei May 10 Pro
could do where you can point the camera
at something and the camera will
automatically adjust to whatever it's
looking at whether it's photography of
food or a portrait photo or a scenery
again things that are not necessarily
new but are great to see in other
handsets now in the case of the b30
overall this is it sadly not really much
else to say but the fact that we've got
a new LG that we are still waiting to
see what the company will do with
flagships going forward and you can bet
that we will put it to its space over
time and let you know if this is worth
it to buy or not well we do that a word
from our sponsor
so let us know in the comments what you
think about the new LG the 30s plus
