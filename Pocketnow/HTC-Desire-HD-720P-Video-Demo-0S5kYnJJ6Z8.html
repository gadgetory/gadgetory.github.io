today i'd like to show you the video
from the HTC Desire HD now what I've
done is I've launched at the video app
and I've set the settings from the
standard which is just below HD then I
bumped it up to the highest setting
which is 720p which is really impressive
you know we're getting HD quality off
the camera and it's not jerky and the
colors are really nice and clean and
crisp so like I've shown you before on
the g2 and the epic 4g I'm in the same
location and relatively the same time of
day or at least in the same lighting
conditions and I'm showing you what
we've got here so we've got an apple
tree over there come over here and it's
getting autumn time so I only have a
couple flowers left so you guys who want
to go ahead and Flay me in the comments
for showing you flowers and now is your
time to do that but nice clean crisp
images there go back and look out at the
horizon again now that was a drastic
change in contrast and we'll see how it
did looking down at the street and all
around autumn so that all the leaves on
the trees are changing colors and then
back up to the house to see what we've
got there so just a really quick run
through of what this camera can do on
the HTC Desire HD and of course I'm not
going to run this through any post
processing or anything like that this is
going to go straight from the camera up
to youtube so you can see really what it
looks like holding this about 12 inches
away from my face just so you can kind
of see what it's like so take a look at
the video quality and the audio quality
and compare that to the other cameras
the other the phones that we've
mentioned in the past anyway if you like
this kind of video go ahead and give the
video a thumbs up subscribe to the
pocket now video YouTube channel and
leave comments below what did you like
about this camera what didn't you like I
mean some of you guys are professional
photographers and stuff so lend us your
expertise let us know how that went so
showing off again the
to see desire HD HD video camera and
that's too many HD is in a row I'm Joe
