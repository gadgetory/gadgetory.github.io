were on the pocket now weekly podcast
debating the mere existence of a Nokia
tablet
well time sure moves quickly doesn't it
the 2520 is the latest in a long line of
Lumias we've covered this season but as
Nokia's first ever Windows tablet it
deserves a close look before it goes on
sale at AT&amp;amp;T this friday i'm michael
fisher with pocket now and we'll be
giving it that close look in a full
review coming soon but for now here's
our first impressions after a day spent
with the Nokia Lumia 2520
let's talk Hardware first coming out of
the box the 25 20 fields pretty massive
in the hand and at 615 grams it's no
lightweight as a 10-inch err it's more
suited to a satchel or a backpack than a
pocket and it's matte finish black silk
paint job means it doesn't immediately
stand out but in exchange for the big
dimensions you've got a soft touch feel
that makes the device seem rounder than
it actually is it's very comfy to hold
and the 10 inch IPS LCD around front is
1080p and quite colorful under the hood
as a snapdragon 800
backed up by 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of storage expandable via microSD the
whole thing is powered by an 8000
milliamp hour battery that Nokia says
can charge up to 80% in just an hour and
when fully charged it's supposed to
provide up to 10 hours of continuous
video playback our 18t model here
supports LTE alongside Wi-Fi for
connectivity America's second largest
network just as speedy as ever here at
the pocket now Boston offices all that
horse power is here to support the
tablets OS which will be familiar to
anyone who's seen a surface and envy x2
or any other Windows tablet if we cover
a lot of them at pocket now by the by so
follow us where we tweet and talk so you
don't miss future reviews and features
the Windows RT 8.1 powers the newest
Lumia with extras out of the box
including Microsoft Office Outlook here
maps and some new multimedia titles
among others
responsiveness as always with Windows it
seems is fluid and smooth the UI
reacting like a floating puck on an air
hockey table desktop mode is still here
if you need it but with the ever-growing
Windows Store it's becoming somewhat
easier to take care of business
exclusively in the modern UI environment
after sinking the 2520 with our
Microsoft account and downloading most
of our apps to the tablet we put it
through a fairly typical afternoon of
use hopping back and forth between work
and play there were very few surprises
Windows RT behaved very well at a core
level and while a few third-party apps
hiccup here and there everything from
Netflix to email to Twitter to the news
ultimately did what it was supposed to
do the speaker's kicked out sound that
was rich and loud and the screen
remained plenty visible outdoors and so
did the fingerprints all over it of
course our experiments with the camera
were a brief but not exactly encouraging
it may be that not even Nokia's famed
carl zeiss optics can make a tablet
camera appealing we'll see in all our
first day with the 2520 is probably best
described as comfortable we've got a lot
more to explore before we're ready to
render a full review but at this point
we like the newest Lumia enough to look
forward to the task and if you want us
to address something specific in that
full review drop us a comment down below
let us know what it is and we'll do our
best to get to it in the meantime please
throw us a like if you enjoyed this
first impressions video and visit us at
pocketnow.com for reviews features
editorials all kinds of coverage on
every mobile device we can get our hands
on this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow once again thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
