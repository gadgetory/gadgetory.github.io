get iphones in October Apple preparing
for quad-core iphone in the future and
the iphone 5 delay seem to be due to
touch panels all the fillmore coming up
right now hello everyone I'm hi everyone
and welcome to the pocket now I reveal
the show we go through all this week
school and they're not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
start this week off with the cool a
Steve Jobs would say isn't it funny a
ship that leaks from the top and we all
heard the rumors that apple will finally
unveil their next-generation iphone on
October fourth though we're really sure
we were going to get one iphone or
iPhones but well Apple board member and
former US Vice President Al Gore just
came on record to state that we're
getting iphones on early October so the
dates match and hopefully the poor would
mean iphones as in different types and
not just the white iphone and a black
one so time will tell so i guess the
biggest question everybody's asking is
are we going to get an iphone 4s and
iphone 4g or an iphone 5 and well images
on the ATT database recently spot an
iphone 4s and not five which doesn't
sound that compelling though well as i
mentioned in the past I review the way
things are going it seems that apple
will actually in VLAN iphone for us as a
successor to the iphone 4 probably
better specs book the same design and
most probably the thinner iphone that
we've been seeing on leagues is actually
just the next generation ipod touch with
probably a larger screen just the
embrace gamers so again rumors we'll see
what happens things are looking good for
the jailbreak community recently five
users and exploits we're discovered on
the a5 chip and aside from that red snow
was recently updated to bring it
untether jailbreak to iOS 4.3 point 5
and iOS 5 and even better is the fact
that you no longer have to download the
full ipsw firmware file to get your
jailbreak all you need to do is point in
that direction unless you're using iOS 5
sadly this new updates of red snow
doesn't bring you a jailbreak to the
ipad 2 on iOS
oh point 3.5 but with the user land
exploits it's only a matter of time
before the dev team figures it out so
figure it out well we all know that the
a5 chip is pretty much a given in the
next generation iphone but we didn't
have anything in writing to pretty much
confirm that statement as anything else
but a rumor now recent images show
iphone internal sporting an a5 chip but
since we don't really know what iphone 5
internals are going to look like we can
pretty much assume that we're not
getting an iphone 5 is going to be an
iphone for us because most likely the
internals are identical to the iphone or
that we currently have now other reports
have apple already working on a quad
core processor for the iphone but given
the fact that Apple hasn't even brought
quad core to the macbook air or even
their 13-inch macbook pro I don't really
see that happening anytime soon and well
apples usually late to the game in what
pertains to spec so most likely I'd hold
that as a rumor and a very lame report
so far
okay so the opposite for the cool that's
continuing on with their not so cool
iphone 5 delay seem to be due to touch
panel defects and some already shipped
units from wintec not sure if the delay
is actually going to affect the
announcement this is just a report from
midget times but again we are expecting
the announcements that happened some
time with in October as it is already
six months well four months later or
three months or something from when we
expected it in June but again Apple most
likely they will have to hurry up and
most likely we will announce the phone
first and then have people buy it later
whenever they figure that out and
continuing on with the not-so-cool news
t-mobile CMO called Broadman came on
record an employee meeting to state that
they were not getting the iphone five
this year and while it doesn't get any
more definitive than that now we're not
really sure if he was trying to save
that were not everybody and I mean no
carrier in the US is getting an iphone
five this year it could probably be that
we are getting an iphone 4s or it could
probably be that the merger with ATT was
so advanced that they were not getting
an iphone 5 or an iphone 4s because most
probably it was coming to t-mobile
anyways with the merger and the merger
is not really happening apparently
anymore so again rumors on our side
definitive on his side let's see who's
right that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm hi Madame
ivetta remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
