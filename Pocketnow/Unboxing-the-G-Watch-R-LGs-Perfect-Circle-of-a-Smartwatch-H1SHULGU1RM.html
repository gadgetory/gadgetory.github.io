SmartWatch that looked a little more
like its round-faced progenitors you had
but one choice the 360 from the folks at
Motorola well as of today in some
markets you've got another option the G
watch are from LG the company sent taka
now a review device to check out so
let's unbox it and take a first look the
retail packaging here is typical of LG's
current smartphone lineup with
understated branding around front and a
panel around back showcasing the watch's
specifications which fall in line with
typical Android wear specs the package
is neither cubical like Samsung's watch
boxes nor the unique cylinder of
Motorola's packaging it's just an
understated but well-made LG box
breaking the seal on the magnetic flap
gets us access to the watch itself which
is the first thing you see when opening
the cover beneath it we find a printed
Quick Start Guide something of a rarity
these days and deeper in the box are the
expected wall adapter and USB cable
along with the charging cradle
reminiscent of the one that came with
the first G watch a high point of that
device once we peel off the protective
plastic film on the PVD coated stainless
steel sides we get our first close look
at the G watch are the watch itself is
chunky in the hand but not necessarily
in a bad way yes the brawny or
construction makes it bigger than the
Moto 360 but my first impression is one
of reassuring strength not cumbersome
bulk that's with my slightly below
average wrist size - your opinion may
vary and no despite its appearance the
numbered bezel does not rotate elsewhere
the 22 millimeter band is genuine
leather and pretty stiff right out of
the box there's a heart rate sensor
around back alongside the pin connectors
that make the charging cradle work the
single side button gives a reassuring
thunk when pressed bringing to life that
1.3 inch plastic OLED display its
striking in everything from its bright
color to its crisp detail and LG has
loaded it with many more
to watch faces than we've seen from some
other manufacturers and yes it is a
perfect circle
everything from interface design to
system responsiveness is well within our
expectations for a modern Android wear
Smart Watch and everything feels just as
it should a system update later and
we're paired with our Moto X ready to
take the G watch hour on an evaluation
run on route to our full review till
