heard for the Samsung Galaxy s8 won't
actually happen rumors point that the
next iPhone will include a two tone
display and for some reason it seems
that the BlackBerry key one just found
some delays I'm high memory that I am
according to one plus their new dash
energy drink is so powerful that it'll
get me through my full night of
bar-hopping
I will go test it out today anyways
happy April Fool's tomorrow this is
 out daily official news today
begin with delays that we could call
them that way as apparently those of you
that want to get that BlackBerry key one
me included we will have to wait until
May and there is a non disclosed
timeframe as to when apparently company
CEO John Shen actually said this on
record so we will let you know as soon
as we get more information
definitely this is one phone I cannot
wait to try and have you ever heard of
intimacy connection with your products
because I never have and I don't really
have time to bet if this was an April
Fool's joke or not let's assume it's not
apparently there is this new analytic
that claims that new polls confirmed
that the company in which consumers have
more emotional connection to his Apple
the third one would be Amazon seventh
would be Samsung let us know in the
comments if you believe that's an April
Fool's joke which we will know until
tomorrow number one and number two if
you agree after thinking of intimacy one
of the things that we enjoyed the most
about the iPad pro 9.7 was it's true two
on display the fact that the display
adapts to whatever lighting is around it
and then we hear from very trusted
sources of this technology is coming to
the next generation iPhone or iPhones
apparently all three models are getting
it that would be something really cool
can't wait to see I with a complete
opposite way to be internet with your
products is facial recognition according
to certain tests that were conducted at
the hands-on booth back at the galaxy
unpacked I actually tried facial
recognition and if you notice my video
closely you will see that I activated
facial recognition with the camera in my
eye and that thing worked it eventually
did not unlock without me having the
camera to my eye but the interesting
part is that people already tested it
with a photograph and it seems that it
worked now there are
ton of disclaimers with the spatial
recognition it's been the case since Ice
Cream Sandwich so again as I said in my
hands-on stick to the IR scanner and
finally the very hot nurses they have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy s8 and the
fact that apparently Samsung is not
going to find delays got sources
claiming to the company has prepared to
up to double the production in the same
time frame as we saw with the galaxy s7
this completely contradicts the previous
rumors and obviously because the company
never really disclose what processors is
using it just a 10 nanometer we're not
really sure what kind of game the
company is going to play with a
Snapdragon our X and O's variants that
is really interesting apparently we will
find delays in the case of the plus
variant that is a difficult case for
reasons we don't know but it leads me to
the question of the day are you ordering
a Samsung Galaxy s8 one number two what
color option and number three would size
in my case honestly I'm actually looking
forward to the small variant this year
but anyways leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
wrenching a little if you want to get to
lose earlier before the video was filmed
