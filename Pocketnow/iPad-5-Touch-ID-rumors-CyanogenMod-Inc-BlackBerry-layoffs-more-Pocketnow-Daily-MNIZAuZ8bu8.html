touch ID services as well cyanogenmod
goes corporate as the company continues
growing and blackberry is full of a lot
of good and a lot of terrible lately I'm
hi meri behna you know I might just plan
a contest to see who wins in pronouncing
my name right this is pocket now daily I
started a off with the surprising news
we've been hearing rumors of nvidia
building an Android tablet for the
longest time but we finally get a tablet
even though they're actually done and
getting more of a platform even though
this is still Android the whole concept
that Nvidia wants to sell you is that
this is now the new Tegra note platform
and they plan to offer it to many OEMs
which there are like a ton of Chinese
OEMs right there which will sell this
platform and the whole idea is again
running Android and it's got stylus
support that we don't know that's gonna
really compete with the Galaxy Note
platform in any way so anyways links in
the description for the full details and
specification of the first tablet and
let's see how well this compete says
nobody has really wanted to get that
Tegra 4 on their current tablets or
phones now let's talk about Google and
more specifically YouTube as the company
creators have now been teasing a new
service that they plan to bring by the
end of the year this is specific to the
YouTube application for mobile devices
and will allow you to download videos to
it and keep them for further reference
on your device meeting you won't need an
internet connection that's really
awesome I mean there are times when
you're flying or commuting and you lose
your internet connection and there are
youtube videos like the pocket out daily
that you'd like to watch yeah well the
plan is that they plan to bring this by
the end of the year obviously we're not
sure if it'll reach every other platform
like when those phones so stay tuned for
that and for those of us fans of
cyanogenmod because yeah that includes
me big-time well the service just grew
up it's now a company it's now
cyanogenmod Inc these people just moved
into an office they have secured funding
and they plan to actually make this
service better than ever the whole idea
is that they're going to make the
service streamlined easy they're going
to build an application for the google
play store that will allow you to
install the rom as easy as installing
any other application which is great
obviously we don't have a timeline for
this but it is great to see cyanogenmod
grow up because it is worth it i mean
wonder when we'll have a phone that
launched with cyanogenmod that would be
awesome and I've been dreading talking
about blackberry but I have to because
there are some good and bad news here on
the good side well the blackberry z30
was announced which is a pretty much a
z10 probably on a bigger chassis it's a
5-inch display lots of better
specifications though it's kind of
interesting links down below for the
full description of the phone and yes
for those of you waiting for BBM on iOS
and Android well Android gets it on
Saturday iOS gets it on Sunday so stay
tuned for that let's see how that goes
but then again on the negative side the
company is now confirming that they will
have to downsize as much as forty
percent of their workforce because
obviously blackberry 10 wasn't as big as
they expected so it begs to wonder you
know it's really sad to hear this I just
wonder if they're gonna get rid of
Alicia Keys first and finally for the
hot news of the day those of you that
have been waiting almost three months to
get iOS 7 on your compatible device can
do it now to a certain degree as well
the servers are completely slammed it's
going crazy I have a ton of friends that
have issues installing activating their
iPhones it is just pandemonium right now
should just be patient you can get it
soon leave us a comment down below and
tell us what you think of iOS 7 so far
they've been testing it and aside from
that it seems that apple will grow up
the ipad 5 to be more than a slimmer
ipad apparently touch ID is also making
it to this device as we've got some
first leaks of the fingerprint scanner
on the hopeland coming to the iPad as
well so you know that leads me to the
question of the day how big is touch ID
for you now that you've seen it for the
iPhone 5s I mean is it really a service
that's so compelling to you that it
would make you buy an iphone or a new
iPad for example in my particular case
honestly that is the only reason why I'm
getting an iphone 5s the only reason I
am big on passwords and that would save
me a ton of time but obviously my case
scenario is different to yours so leave
us a comment down below why would you
get an iphone 5s is such idea reason
friends is always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in a
smartphone and telco make sure you
follow us on pacquiao comment subscribe
to our youtube channel as well he also
follow me on twitter I'm younger scored
any better let's give this video thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I am hi
Natalie then I thank you very much for
watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
