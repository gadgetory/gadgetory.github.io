pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the software on
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon
so sit back relax and enjoy the show now
if you've seen honeycomb once you've
seen it as many times as you're going to
see it it's exactly the same on this
device as it is on the Wi-Fi version
save it's got a couple of the verizon
type apps on it including some games
that were included on like uno and dead
space it's got the daily on here as well
Netflix is built in unsurprisingly it's
got the mobile hotspot capabilities
which you wouldn't have in the Wi-Fi
version it's really as expected
blockbuster the backup you know
capabilities my verizon unfortunately
you can't delete any of these apps at
all it's terrible and I really hate
bloat I would rather see a clean stock
device but in this case verizon does
have some of that on there it would be
interesting to see when ICS comes out
how much of that gets taken away or when
a custom rom comes out for this
particular device how much this device
speeds up by removing some of the
backend below to you it may be exact as
we mentioned in the harbor review that
it may actually be due to Honeycomb but
I had to do some other honeycomb devices
that work this kind of sluggish you've
got your standard soft home buttons here
and the unfortunate camera or rather
capture key here you've got the quick
options here and you can edit them based
upon the apps that they provide not your
own and you've got various widgets on
the screen and it looks just like
honeycomb would apps up here if you go
back to this menu then you've got your
settings here Wi-Fi etc and then if you
go into settings then it will pop up the
standard honeycomb options here go to
about device
see the Android 3 to see our battery use
just that you would expect on honeycomb
nothing terribly surprising here the
thing that it does have and it's not any
different than any other Samsung device
it's got your screen display style your
mode so you can change it from standard
to dynamic movie you've got the motion
sensing capabilities so if you turn on
those motion movements then you can you
know scroll back and forth between
screens by using the gyroscope or you
can you know zoom in and out on pictures
by tapping hauling then twisting the
device back and forth not items that I
generally like to leave on but they are
there a couple other items of note on
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon
we've got the browser up here in the
quick launch mode which you can enable
on the labs which gives you the ability
to kind of slide over from the side and
and select the kind of multi tools here
and your settings a nice view here it's
something we covered in the original 7.7
software tour and just want to pop in
here and show you kind of what we're
looking at for the browser just to
demonstrate we really are looking at the
same kind of configuration here save the
LTE and the 3g capabilities from verizon
in this as you see we've got the browser
app it's still loading just a little bit
there give it a couple more seconds to
finish loading so that the speed
difference isn't noticeable one other
item that we didn't mention earlier when
I was talking about these smart buttons
down here this button while it set the
camera capture or the screen capture by
default it can be changed in the
settings it's just not really intuitive
and frankly I had I would think would be
better to serve as a shortcut for the
camera by default rather than the screen
capture by default so now we're looking
at the whole page fully loaded for
pocket now calm if we scroll down you
see that kind of refresh that's
happening here is it swipes across the
screen the black that goes back and
forth there and even as it go up it does
the same thing even though the page is
completely loaded and to me that's
really just the distracting in my
personal opinion it does work just fine
and I really do like the functionality
of having this little sidebar and would
love to see other browsers be able to
implement similar things as well the
other item of note that I like to show
you here is the smart road which gives
you the ability to take advantage of the
IR port here and it's essentially a TV
watching style of app although it you
can see here we've got TV shows and it's
got a listing of what's available in my
area and movies and sports etc etc but
most importantly we have this option up
here where we can turn devices on and
off such as my TV or my audio system and
if we go into here and we say rooms and
devices we can see we've got the
provider set we've got the TV type we've
got the AV receiver and then you can add
multiple devices further devices as well
that allow you to control those devices
by IR anything like that that works on
IR will connect with this and it's got a
pretty good wizard for viewing how that
stepping you through the process and
really making it very simple to be able
to use this app there's been a couple of
free updates since I got the the
application while I've got a different
multi-function remote personally I found
that this was actually pretty good and
surprisingly very useful for this style
tablets not something that I expected to
find on this device if you want to see
more about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
specifically in with with the OS the
TouchWiz OS and how honeycomb works on
this then go out and look at our
original Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 video
that Brandon did it will give you a lot
more detail about some of the settings
that are available otherwise it's the
same device it just has the LTE and 3g
capabilities put in and it suffers from
the same problems as the original
devices does as well the screen voting
times and the
the rotational speeds etc etc that wraps
up our software tour on the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon give any
comments or questions please even below
if you like the video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
