androids really cool at being a driving
companion really with its built-in GPS
and all the gps apps that are available
for it but without a car dock it's not
all that useful because you don't want
your Android just skittering across the
dash every time you turn a corner or
sitting in the cupholder next to you or
on the seat next to you some phones like
the Nexus One have a car dock for it
others don't so what do you do in that
case well you get one from a third party
that will fit almost any Android phone
let's go take a look alright so here is
the car dock from our con spelled AR kon
and it's very basic it didn't come in a
box it came in a very simple plastic bag
with four components an alcohol wipe an
adhesive-backed base if you need to
mount onto a dashboard rather than on to
a a windshield it came with a universal
mounting arm and there's your nice
suction cup complete with the protective
film you want to leave on until you're
ready to install that into the vehicle
and then you've got this universal
connection head on it moving over to the
actual grippy part let me show you the
way to shift you'll notice this is
pretty basic that's the receptacles
where this Universal connector plugs in
you just put it in slide it up and it
makes a very solid connection come back
over here now these little arms these
are these are kind of fun you'll notice
that they just have a little groove in
them they've got a soft pad and they're
kind of contoured to fit if you can see
that too just elegantly accent and maybe
add a little bit more strength to to the
little grippy arm but anyway there are
two different varieties of those grip
ease with this particular kit now this
kit is specifically designed to work
with the g2 but it should work with any
other phone that is no longer than the
g2 which is most of them but to
accommodate that they have an
they're special grippy arm you can see
this one down here standard one and the
extended one so I'm going to very
quickly and easily put this on we'll
slide this on to the bottom and there
are two of these on the bottom and you
can orient them however you need to
whether that's closer together or
further apart to accommodate headphone
jacks charging ports and what not but
there it is very simple now this is
spring loaded it's a very tight
mechanism there so something that I like
but the way that this works is simple
you mount this in your car you put your
phone in on the bottom of those longer
grip ease and just push down and rotate
up and then there you go I don't
recommend doing this at home by the way
but can see regardless of what position
I put my phone in its hanging onto it
really snuggly i can adjust over my my
grippy arms to allow access right there
to the headphone jack up in the top of
course my charging port is over on the
side so that's not going to be a problem
and then down on the bottom it just
holds on really tightly so really nice
in the way that this hangs on to it
relatively inexpensive too I mean you're
looking at you know 50 60 70 maybe even
a hundred bucks for a similar doc say
for the nexus one which is really nice
and it has some bluetooth features in
the price is justified this is just dock
but it does its job and it does it
really well so this this is going to run
you know less than 30 bucks shipping
included so i would highly recommend
that you go out and get one of those
this is going to be mounted in my car
today so that i can finally move my
phone out of the cup holder and up onto
the dash you may not be able to do that
in your locality some in some places
that's illegal and of course you don't
want to obstruct your view so there's

stuff like this this is something that i
actually got for christmas so no
promotional consideration was provided
by our Khan at all this is an actual
true review and so far i love it if i
don't like the way it mounts or if it
doesn't do very good in the car i'll let
you know that in the comments but so far
i'm very impressed with it make sure you
