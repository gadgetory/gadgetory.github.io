pocket now calm and this is our full
review of the Nexus 7 tablet let's get
to it it says it right on the box
this tablet is made for Google Play but
really the Nexus 7 is made for two
groups of people as we mentioned in our
unboxing first it's made for what we
call the granny group that is people
that want things to be simple and easy
the granny group want a great out of box
experience the second group that the
Nexus 7 is made for is the power user
those that want to be able to customize
every aspect of their device have the
fastest software possible and be able to
upgrade their device with third-party
tweaks Motz and roms whether you're a
part of the first or second group the
Nexus 7's price tag of 199 or 249 is
extremely attractive our review will
mostly target the second group of the
power user let's start off talking about
hardware the seven inch form factor for
many is a sweet spot and better
alternative to the 10 inch tablets that
reign supreme at 7 inches the tablet
becomes narrow enough to wear portrait
typing is very comfortable also at 7
inches the device can be lightweight
enough to feel unsubstantial which is
critical when reading watching video or
using a tablet for a long period of time
our Nexus 7 came from Google i/o and
thus has the white backing everyone else
that buys the Nexus 7 through Google
Play will get the grey bag if you really
like the white chances are you'll be
able to buy a white backing from a third
party as the white component is just a
back cover that is probably easy to
remove and change the back cover whether
white or grey is a fantastic dimpled
texture that helps tremendously to make
the device feel comfortable and steady
in hand it's made from a rubbery plastic
here on the back we see a big Nexus logo
plus Asus branding on the bottom the
speaker below the Asus branding was
unremarkable
like most tablets it's relatively quiet
and sounds tinny on the bottom here we
have a micro USB charging port plus a
3.5 millimeter headphone plug on the
side we have a power button and volume
rocker the power button protrudes away
from the body of the Nexus 7 making it
easy to feel for unfortunately because
the front of the neck
seven is so symmetrical we found
ourselves often picking up the tablet
from the wrong end and missing the power
button the front-facing camera is really
the only way to tell which end is the
time in terms of wait the Nexus 7 is one
of the lightest tablets on the market
lending to an especially comfortable
experience when holding it for long
periods of content viewing the Nexus 7
might have the appearance of thinness
but it's really not at ten point five
millimeters thick Google and Asus was
able to create the illusion of thinness
thanks to this sharp edge but in hand
when you wrap your fingers around the
back of the Nexus 7 there's definitely a
fair amount of thickness to it let's
talk about the display it's a 1280 by
800 7 inch LCD panel if you're using a
Galaxy Nexus or any other device with an
AMOLED screen you're likely to find the
screen of the Nexus 7 to be washed out
and lacking contrast and adequate color
saturation in comparison we
characterized the display on the Nexus 7
as dull because of this that said thanks
to a reasonable PPI of 2:14 text a sharp
and crisp even though you can't still
see pixels if you look closely in terms
of other specs the Nexus 7 is the first
7-inch tablet with a quad-core CPU it
has a Tegra 3 1.3 gigahertz CPU and
google claims that there are 12 yes 12
GPU cores inside you'll also find a
gigabyte of RAM and either eight gigs or
16 gigs of storage because of the low
price point some compromises had to be
made for example there is no microSD
storage also there are no cellular data
options which severely hampers the
portability of the Nexus 7 the Nexus 7
has the newest version of Android
version 4.1 jellybean
while we've talked a lot about jellybean
and be sure to check out our tour of
jelly bean on the Galaxy Nexus will
cover the features of jellybean that
most impact the experience on the Nexus
7 let's turn the device on here on the
home screen we can begin to see the
dichotomy between the two intended
audiences of the Nexus 7 the grannie
gripping the power user out of the box
the Nexus 7 presents you with content
from Google Play lots and lots of
content and jellybean there are several
new widgets that give you a Nuke tablet
like experience but putting movies TV
shows magazines books and songs at your
here I've got two home screens showing
my movies and TV content my music some
recommendations and so on all of the
Google Play content widgets are pre-made
as a kind of mosaic of all your content
you can't for instance pick which books
or shows go on your home screen like you
can with the Nook Tablet it just kind of
randomizes the order and to help you get
started on google play you get a twenty
five dollar store credit as soon as you
activate the Nexus 7 with your Google
account
this works seamlessly and you'll get an
email telling you that the credit has
been added now what if you don't want to
buy content from Google Play fortunately
since this is Android you have a lot of
choice if you rather stream your movies
from Netflix that's fine get the Netflix
app if you rather stream music from
Spotify that's fine
get the Spotify app unlike the Nook
Tablet and Kindle Fire you have complete
freedom to get content however you
choose here in the center I have a home
screen that makes a lot more sense to me
as a power user it's clean and simple
and neatly organized with a handful of
folders from my most used apps and also
a battery widget at the top I have some
remaining space where I might place an
email widget or other something else
you're likely to notice is that Google
used a phone layout for the Nexus 7
meaning the notification shade is at the
top instead of the bottom this reminds
us a lot of the first Galaxy Tab which
was based off of Gingerbread frankly we
kind of liked having the notifications
on the bottom in which wish there was a
way to switch it on the Nexus 7 now
let's talk about jellybean we're going
to cover two areas that impact the Nexus
7 the most the first is project butter
and the second is notifications in all
previous versions of Android there was
an unexplainable lag in a lot of places
like opening the app drawer the task
switcher and so on project butter aims
to fix that by forcing the entire UI to
operate at a high frame rate and also to
prioritize touch input so that the
system anticipates your touches and make
sure that the system is as responsive as
possible we're happy to report that this
has made a huge difference in the
overall fluidity of Android everything
feels well buttery smooth with the
exception of the occasional hiccup most
notably in the web browser which might
be a result of early software the second
feature of Android 4.1 we want to
as notifications notifications appear
where they do for a phone the shade has
been redesigned to allow notifications
to give you more information like email
previews and action buttons we really
won't see the full utility of this
feature until developers update their
apps notifications can now be expanded
and contracted with an awkward to finger
gesture now let's get into the actual
use of the tablet on the Nexus 7 you can
now read magazines you can actually read
magazines on any Android device now as
long as your Google Play has received
the update which is nice because if you
buy a magazine on your tablet you can
read it later on your phone although at
this time the page is not synchronized
but reading magazines on the Nexus 7 is
a little bit awkward
they'll bit better than on the Nook
Tablet or Kindle Fire because they have
lower resolution screens here in the
Play magazine app we can flip through
the magazines that I've bought most of
which have a free trial so you can try
it before you buy it
the selection of magazines in Google
Play is a bit thin at the moment
clicking on a magazine will take you
into a horizontally scrollable list of
pages just like you get on the Nook
Tablet or Kindle Fire you can use the
usual page navigation tools on the
bottom like thumbnail previews and a
table of contents pop out you can view
an article in a text view which is nice
because the display on the Nexus 7 isn't
high resolution enough to be able to
read most magazines at the entire zoomed
out view there's a lot of pinching and
zooming to be done if you want to get
the full content of the article beyond
magazines Nexus 7 does a pretty good job
at playing back 720p video with good
frame rates though you'll see black bars
on the top and the bottom that said if
you rather purchase your content and
download it then stream it you'll be
excited to see that Google Play now has
TV shows right now the selection is
limited let's talk about gaming as
mentioned Google claimed that the Nexus
7 has 1212 GPU cores so we were expected
to be blown away by gaming we use Tegra
zone to find titles optimized for the
Tegra 3 CPU such as Shadowgun and Zen
Pinball here in Shadowgun gaming
performance looked quite good but it's
obvious that the game is not optimized
for the 1280 by 800 display because we
saw quite a bit of artifacting in Zen
Pinball we had much better results
then in gta3 we once again saw quite a
bit of artifacting but performance was
generally good but not amazing overall
the Nexus 7 is one of the best gaming
tablets around but we think Google over
hyped it as the ultimate gaming machine
now let's talk a bit about web browsing
the default browser on the Nexus 7 is
chrome those that use Chrome on the
desktop will enjoy tabbed bookmark and
password synchronization we're also
really digging the side swipe gesture
that lets you switch between tabs
without having to tap on the tabs at the
top under heavy use case scenarios with
many tabs open and while NIT navigating
a graphically intense webpage Chrome did
indeed stutter and lag again this might
have to do with the fact that chrome is
still new and jellybean is not totally
finalized but we were at times
disappointed with the web browsing
performance when pushing the limits of
the tablet finally let's talk about some
test notes first battery life google
claims 8 to 10 hours of battery life on
the Nexus 7 after 2 days of use with
about 3 hours of use on each day my
Nexus 7 ran out of juice that included a
lot of game playing and video watching
with average used battery life should be
in the 8 to 10 hour range that is
advertised we also noticed that the
Nexus 7 takes a particularly long time
to charge perhaps even a bit longer than
the iPad 3 which takes seven hours to go
from zero to 100% so here's what we like
and what we don't like about the Nexus 7
we like that it has a fantastic price we
like that overall it provides great
performance and fluidity and all apps
and while navigating the OS and finally
we will like that the tablet feels
fantastic in hand often reminding us of
a paperback book with its lightweight
what we don't like is that the screen
appears dull and washed out we don't
like that the device takes nearly 7
hours to charge and we don't like that
there is no microSD storage plus no
option for cellular data we give the
Nexus 7 a four and a half out of five
stars
so in conclusion while there are several
compromises you have to live with with
the Nexus 7 such as a screen that is
overall dull no microSD storage and no
sight
data options it's a hundred and
ninety-nine bucks and it's fast and it
works very very well end to end
it can't be beat it's a Kindle Fire
killer although the kinder fought fire
too should be out relatively soon but
standing by itself the Nexus 7 is an
awesome tablet and if you pre-ordered
one you can feel confident but it's a
fast capable tablet that that is an
extremely good value if you liked this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now
