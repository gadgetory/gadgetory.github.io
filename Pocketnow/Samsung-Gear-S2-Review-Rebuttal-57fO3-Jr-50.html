SmartWatch world is still in search of
its perfect device and while this isn't
it it gets a lot closer than I expected
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is the Samsung gear s2 review
rebuttal
it's a rebuttal because it's not a full
review our official review already went
up a few months back courtesy of our own
Jules Wang and it's when we still stand
behind but after using an s2 loaner
myself as part of our trial of a TN
t--'s numbersync feature I had a few
additional thoughts of my own one thing
I'll say having strapped on both the
standard and classic editions of this
watch at both FIFA and CES this one is a
fair bit beefier that's because this is
the 3g variant which is over 2
millimeters thicker than the bluetooth
only model and it's white band and
bright metal casing make every bit of
that added height very visible so if
you're in the market for one of these be
sure and take note of which one you're
looking at the added bulk will be worth
it to you though if you often find
yourself separated from your smartphone
during my testing I left my phone at
home several times while going out on
the town with the gear s2 and because
the watch could connect independently to
AT&amp;amp;T network I could still make voice
calls send and receive text messages and
check the news samsung deserves a lot of
credit first for being willing to strike
off on its own direction with the design
and second for being willing to abandon
its previous design language while
2014's gear s was a cumbersome cuff the
gear s2 is actually quite attractive
more than that it's innovative I get the
same feeling from using the rotating
bezel as I did using Apple's digital
crown namely why didn't somebody think
of this sooner
the spinning bezel is something that's
been built into many watches for decades
and it makes all the sense in the world
to put it to work as a software switch
on the s2 the Tizen based software is as
zippy as you can ask for and its high
contrast iconography is just gorgeous on
the 1.2 inch AMOLED screen that said
using the s2 software takes some getting
used to
in addition to the bezel you've got two
hardware buttons on the side plus a
touchscreen with its own set of gestures
to learn not to draw another comparison
to the Cupertino competition but
constantly switching back and forth
between the various interface methods
mirrors the kind of muddled UX I
encountered on the Apple watch also some
basic watch functions like the timer and
stopwatch are buried deep in the app
menu which makes getting to them
cumbersome fortunately there's a
shortcut you can set the home button to
jump directly to a specific app with a
double click features like that are all
over the gear s2 software actually and
it takes a while to uncover them all
holding down the home button lets you
power the watch off but it also gives
you access to power saving mode which
switches the watch to grayscale and
powers down most of its functions to
help you last a little longer if you
forgot your charger the charger by the
way is a very cool magnetic pedestal
that uses qi wireless charging swiping
down on the watch face is a lot like
doing so on an android phone get to a
connection screen as well as Do Not
Disturb settings and other system
toggles these are all great features to
have but again it feels sort of like a
whole smartphone it's been crammed onto
your wrist no matter how good the
interface is that's a lot of stuff to
squeeze into a tiny little display and
so the s2 feels the pretty crowded the
more you try to do with it one of my
favorite features is weirdly in text
messaging yeah it's nice to be able to
dictate messages on pebble and Android
wear watches and you can do it here too
but when you don't want to talk you can
type Samsung is built in a t9 style
keyboard here which is fantastic if you
grew up sending SMSs with a numeric
keypad on a dumb phone if you didn't
well there's always the emoticons the
gear s2 isn't quite a slam-dunk
like most smartwatches I think it's
fairly overpriced though AT&amp;amp;T does offer
various promotions to bring that cost
down including a current offer to get a
free s2 with a qualifying Galaxy
smartphone purchase the fact that it
syncs with Samsung's gear app means
third-party app installs are a little
more complex than on say Android wear
and while it's supposed to work with
most modern Android phones you'll have
to take your chances if you can't find
your model on Samsung's already outdated
compatibility list but as a companion to
a newly purchased Galaxy smartphone or a
change of pace from the stark simplicity
of Android wear the gear s2 will please
those already sold on the SmartWatch as
a category and as an indication of what
Samsung can do when it chooses to
innovate rather than replicate it's a
genuine success story
