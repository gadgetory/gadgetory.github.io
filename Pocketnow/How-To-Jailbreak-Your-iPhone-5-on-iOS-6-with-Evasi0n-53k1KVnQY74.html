is the best-selling smartphone in the
world and it is for reason I mean the
design is beautiful it's a great device
but sadly the operating system is what
is really lacking I mean some of us
really wish it ran Android or some other
solution and the cool thing is that
evasion for iOS 6 is now available and
if you ever wanted to do more with your
iPhone well the smartest thing to do is
to jailbreak it so I'm hi meri behna
this is fuck it now and we'll show you
how to jailbreak your iphone this
procedure is fairly simple it's the same
for every iOS 6 compatible device you
need the iphone a USB cable and a
compatible computer all you need to do
is go to evasion calm which is actually
a0 and not a no once you're there to
check if the browser's compatible give
you a version of linux OS 10 and windows
you get official mirrors requirements
important reading the information
frequently asked questions credits
thanks to an even a place to donate
you'll download the version that's
compatible with your computer just click
here and obviously this is OS 10 so
it'll download the dmg file yes this is
an application that you have to run from
your computer but nothing will really
happen all it'll do is download the
application you run it for the first
time and then it will tell you obviously
that evasion is not something that's
signed for but don't worry about it just
open the app and all you have to do from
here is just get your device just
connect the device to USB and once the
device is detected by USB and therefore
detected by evasion you'll notice that
the jailbreak button lights up and all
you have to do is press the jailbreak
button you don't have to do anything
else the device does everything for you
and meaning the computer you really have
to do very little with the iphone and
we're gonna fast-forward here just for
illustration purposes not bore you with
all the full procedure and how it goes
on you'll notice that it will reboot
your device for the first time and then
once it reboots its it'll start
injecting the jailbreak and pretty much
everything that goes on here then it
goes to step to it it's an injection
stage and it's uploading city and its
packages and then what's that happens
notice that you have to unlock your
device and then look for a new
application called jailbreak just hit
that jailbreak application
and then that will tell the evasion
application that it's ready for the
final jailbreak so it's going to reboot
again once the reboot happens you'll
notice that it'll start installing cydia
it's finding offsets and then it reboots
the device again you'll probably have a
little issue with the screen it'll go
completely dim but you unlock your
device once you unlock you'll notice
that instead of the jailbreak
application you'll have Cydia now
available it'll prepare the file system
we're going to fast-forward just to not
bore you and then once the file system
is prepared here we go with the dimming
issue just have to fix the deming issue
in the brightness section and then once
you're there Cydia is completely
installed you tell you're a user and you
have jailbroken your device remember
city is where you get all the hacks
weeks and all the cool stuff that makes
jailbreak even possible and worth it so
this is really simple this is really it
that's all you have to do that's it for
a quick video tutorial on how to
jailbreak iOS 6 remember this is fully
available to any iphone running iOS 6 we
