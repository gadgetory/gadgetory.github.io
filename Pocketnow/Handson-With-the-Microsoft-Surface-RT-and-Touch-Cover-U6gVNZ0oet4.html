calm and i'm here with the surface RT we
have a bunch of them here actually play
with this red one
and let's first my first time touching
it
at that
and that click
very nice metal
i touch covers
very flexible right there just like a
little cloth material
here's the trackpad
opens it there we go touch screen
I've never tried the keyboard on this so
I'm going to do it here
interesting
it's not capacitive it's a
pressure-sensitive
that's a very strange feeling
there's a little little texture there on
the f and J so you can feel it and just
setting my fingers there it's not typing
but pressure just put a little pressure
there
and it types Wow
very cool
flip it around and have a kickstand like
that
that's a passive windows t there
let's see if I can hold it up privacy
and I'm not sure if I can detach it with
one yep I did
missed it
there we go that time it clicked and
it's in there very nice
kick stand back and there should be a
microSD card
there's the slot right under there
and it just comes right back on
touch cover up
I guess it didn't go to sleep
ok now comes back
see if it does automatic screen rotation
yep took a second
turn back
this camera is a pointing kind of angled
let's find the camera app
there's me let's switch to the
background
cameras pointed kind of straight when
it's on a kickstand
instead of pointing down like some
others might be doing
like you did
see how flexible that touch cover is
it's a zoom in on our keys
surprise only got that
there's our search button
share device's settings
function key
world numbers
so there you go that's the surface RT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
