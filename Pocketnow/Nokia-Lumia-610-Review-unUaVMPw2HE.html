this is our full review of the Nokia
Lumia 610 the cheapest Nokia Lumia
windows phone running Windows Phone 7.5
tango check out the goods and the bed
the box of the Lumia 610 is exactly the
same as every other nokia box except it
features a picture of the Lumia 610 on
the top and on the side it's a blue
carton which slides out to reveal the
phone placed right on top of the
packaging underneath the phone there's
the battery and deep inside the box you
find the usual instruction manuals a
pair of headphones the USB charger and
the micro USB cable for syncing and
charging the Nokia Lumia 610 is not a
powerhouse it has low specifications
even compared to first-wave Windows
Phones not to mention those on the
market today
like the Nokia Lumia 900 or the HTC
Titan tube at the heart of the Nokia
Lumia 610 there's a single core Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor clocking at 800
megahertz and there's not too much RAM
to help it 256 megabytes the ROM size is
also 256 Meg's and the internal storage
is half of what should be finding and
most windows phones on the market at the
moment with only 8 gigabytes for your
pictures videos and documents of course
there's always SkyDrive to expand it
some more since you know there's no
microSD expansion slot on the phone
which is really not Nakia sold the
camera is one of 5 megapixels with an
LED flash and the screen is a low-end
screen in terms of quality
it's a 3.7 inches with a wvg resolution
of 480 by 800 pixels the radio on the
Lumia 610 makes it compatible with GSM
as well as HSDPA networks it can connect
to Wi-Fi b/g/n hotspots and has
Bluetooth 2.1 a GPS accelerometer an FM
radio and everything is powered by a 13
hundred million power battery if you
need to describe the Lumia 610 in a
single word you'd be probably using the
word candy
not because it is somewhat of a candy
bar design but because of the shiny
backing which embraces the lower part of
the front Nakia made sure to make the
phone available in several colors white
magenta black and the cyan which we are
reviewing now the overall size of the
phone is medium in a world where huge
smartphones are more and more popular
rocking five point three four point
eight and four point seven inch screens
it measures 119 millimeters in height 62
millimeters in width and 12 millimeters
in thickness with the battery inserted
it weighs 132 grams which is not so bad
but pretty heavy for a phone such small
the HTC One X and the Galaxy s3 with
huge screens weigh approximately the
same on the top there's a tiny speaker
right above the Nokia logo there's a
proximity sensor and an ambient light
sensor at the far right but you will not
find a front-facing camera on this
device which could be a deal-breaker for
some while others can easily live
without it the bottom part of the Lumia
610 front features the compulsory
Windows Phone buttons right below the
screen they are capacitive and referred
to back start and search beneath them
there's a small microphone hole right
under the dark blue metal strip that
embraces the screen all the way to the
top and on the sides the 3.7 inch screen
is just a little bit larger than the
screen of the iPhone which is 3.5 inches
and already consider small unfortunately
this is not knock yes best screen the
ClearBlack AMOLED to be found on the
lumia 900 and the lumia 800 filter
instead the finished manufacturer went
with a lower end screen which doesn't
disappoint at all color reproduction is
good the contrast levels are normal and
the overall color temperature is a
little bit warm however there's
something we didn't like about the Lumia
610 display and it's the backside
bleeding you will get plenty of that on
the sides top and bottom we found it to
be intrusive and decided to go with
Windows Phones white theme instead of
the dark one but the bleeding is visible
in situations where there's a lot of
black displayed the back is where the 5
megapixel camera is
tiny LED flash dudes left the bottom
part holds the grill with nicely
executed holes allowing the metallic
sound from the speaker behind to shine
through you can definitely listen to
music on the Lumia 610 this if you don't
mind all the hisses and the absolute
lack of low frequencies we didn't expect
woofer light performance but we would
have liked some low mids every now and
then the user interfaces Metro UI and
the software powering the Lumia 610 is
Windows Phone seven point seven point
eighty seven seventy three point ninety
eight codename tango because it's a
Windows Phone it has all the tiles and
hubs and panorama specific to the
platform even if this is a low-end phone
thanks to tango the entire Windows Phone
experience is unaltered under low
specifications of the Lumia extent
however the about screen will
immediately inform you that quote
because this phone has 256 Meg's of RAM
application selection and features may
be limited this is true you won't be
able to install applications like Skype
for audio and video calling and you will
not be able to play games like Angry
Birds though developers are probably
working on dedicated lower end virgins
for their software titles we ran into
situations when we had to wait one or
two seconds for the phone to do
something like open Bing search in the
meat aisle or the marketplace which is
wearing a special customized Nike icon
application load times are also a tad
longer than on other windows phones but
the Lumia 610 is only lagging behind a
couple of seconds which is nothing major
if you don't have a stronger Windows
Phone nearby to compare them
side-by-side once applications are
loaded everything is moved since the
Lumia 610 is a Nakia phone you will be
able to use all the free goodies the
finnish manufacturer offers you like
Nokia Drive
Nakia Maps and Nokia transport which are
on the phone out of the box while you
can easily download maps for free for
your region to use with Nokia Drive and
now Kia Maps probably has you covered
Nokia transport will probably not be
able to help you if you live in an
unsupported region
there's also an app highlights title
installed where you can see a nice
representation of recommended
applications as well as a contact
transfer application to help you move
your contacts via bluetooth from your
old phone if supported overall the
device has performed well given that its
internals are low-end the 13 hundred
million power battery can help you go
for one one and a half days with the
usual calls emails and the regular stuff
like texting social networking and so on
the Lumia 610 makes surprisingly good
pictures as long as you're not depending
on the tiny built-in flash pocket now
and we're checking the video recording
capabilities of the Nokia Lumia 610 as
well as the sound which is captured
while recording video as you can see
it's cloudy outside but the conditions
are rather good let's step up close see
some close-ups
let's go up see some right there
it's scoping a little bit difficult Lee
with the changing conditions but
hopefully the rest looks good
we've also liked the above-average
battery life and the smaller form factor
which is a breath of fresh air in
today's world of huge devices you can
easily operate the Lumia 610 with one
hand when those phone runs a tad slower
on the Lumia 610 but it runs with the
same fluidity like every other Microsoft
powered smartphone it might take a
second or two longer to load certain
applications but once they're loaded
there's no problem however the
application selection can defer since
the Lumia has a low amount of memory
applications like Skype and games like
Angry Birds are not supported on the
phone at the moment of this review so
this is something to keep in mind when
purchasing a Lumia 610 nakiya's budget
Lumia together with Windows Phone tango
were designed with a low price point in
mind to help gain market share and enter
emerging markets it's not available in
the u.s. at the time of this review but
you can import it from Europe for prices
ranging anywhere between 210 and 260
dollars which makes it the cheapest
Lumia Windows Phone compared to
unsubsidized models we're giving the
Lumia 610 a three out of five and we can
recommend it to someone not willing to
spend a lot of money on a smart phone or
to someone who is just entering the
smartphone world and for whatever reason
doesn't want an Android based device
similarly priced make sure to read our
full written review over at

experiences and our photo gallery with
pictures and video samples this passant
