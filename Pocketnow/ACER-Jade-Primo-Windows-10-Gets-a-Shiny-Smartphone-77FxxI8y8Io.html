than one way to do Windows on mobile and
the latest very shiny iteration comes
from Acer I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is a first look at
the Acer Jade Premo brought to you by D
brand it may be new to the hands-on
scene but the Acer Jade primo is
actually one of the first Windows 10
mobile phones announced back at Aoife
2015 a few months back this is the first
chance we've had to go hands-on though
and the Primeau does pack a surprise or
two within its familiar shell on the
downside this is a lot like other Acer
phones we've seen over the years plastic
build with a faux metallic hairline
finish and super gloss coating
very lightweight and thin construction
and speakers that look a lot like sink
drains it's okay it's not bad but not
much more than that
and it's hardly the kind of top-notch
industrial design that a new platform
like Windows 10 mobile needs to make a
splash but you know what the bar hasn't
been set terribly high by the
competition at least not yet so if
you're looking for something that at
least looks a bit higher end the Jade
Primo might be your game and it's not
just looks just as it does on the Lumia
950 the Snapdragon 808 processor runs
Windows 10 mobile like a champ here it
doesn't hurt that it's backed up by
three gigs of RAM which will likely help
it when running continuum it's one of a
very few phones to do so at this point
on Windows factory in a 21 megapixel
camera LTE category 6 and an absolutely
gorgeous 5 and 1/2 inch Super AMOLED
display at full HD and it's tough not to
get excited about this phone if you're a
fan of Windows 10 mobile Acer says the
specs are subject to change depending on
market and it's unclear at this point
whether the phone will support things
like Windows hello
price and availability stateside are
similarly TBD we'll look forward to
learning more there's more coming from
Pocket now at CES 2016 including more
from the Windows Mobile Kamp
stay tuned both here on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com until next time this has
been Michael Fischer with high auto
Houston behind the camera thanks for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
