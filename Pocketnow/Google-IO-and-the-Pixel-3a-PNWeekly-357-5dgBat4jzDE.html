like actually analyzing the food
listening yeah Frankie analyzing the
food but also I remembered think you
were fasting that day so I'm like of
course you love this food but then again
yeah this guy yes Ramadan Mubarak thank
you hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly brought to you by pocket now next
day developers recorded on this day may
10th it is Friday this episode hopefully
will be coming out a little bit later on
this very day
however we are back in our respective
studios I have a couple of very special
guests with me this week we're gonna be
talking all about Google i/o but as you
can see we're not using a Google service
in order to record this podcast we're
back on skype with OBS it went so well
last week that we are continuing with it
and I'm happy to have these two with me
let's start off with the attendee of
Google i/o TK Bay what's going on there
how are you guys it's been a while I
mean it's been a long time since I've
seen you Josh of course and David it's
been some time and I hope to be able to
hang out with you very very soon doing
good doing good keeping busy let's say
yeah you think this you and I we
actually hung out on the first day of
i/o well yeah the day before i/o what
well yeah well no no the morning no they
had the day before exactly I we we start
up in that morning he had actually we
had a couple of meetings that day and
then actually went with you if anyone
saw my Instagram stories I went with you
to the freakin registration only to not
attend at all yeah I know I didn't have
a QR code but I bet I I'm willing to bet
that I could have talked to somebody and
they would have been like are you ready
they're just come in you're physically
here you went through the whole walk
around and yeah no it was and then you
gave us a tour which is really even
better than you know oh yeah we went
walking around and we looked at all the
statues which are in decay I don't know
Kogan if you've ever seen by the way
David Cogan the unlocker joining us this
week uh by the way in front of a very
beautifully put together set by the way
me yeah yeah
it's just Mike it's a corner of my room
really my apartment I just really
quickly put some lights up which is
making it look nicer but these are all
little trinkets that I don't know what
to do with I know that's a good look I
see I see - okay let me see if I can
name off a few of these things there so
you have your Android there you have
literally just things that we get sense
exactly
is that a real succulent those - this
one yeah no that's awesome because you
and I talked a little bit earlier did
you buy some succulents we talked about
this yes I notoriously suck at keeping
plants alive that includes succulents I
kill them all yep so literally I have I
bought more because they were on sale
and I'm thinking like for six dollars
even if I kill him you know yeah not
that bad that's her bad no shying either
one of them too much or too little I
don't understand how they work and then
I see both Qualcomm cups at the top
there Qualcomm shrine up here which is
weird
I guess I'm assuming those are from the
Maui trips yeah there was at the very
last day they give you these to drink
out of
yeah no no but they look like yeah so
they have that Maui mates yeah tiki mugs
is exactly and then of course no one's
talking about those snapchat specs
no one does anyway so doesn't matter no
neither their relics that's why they're
that exact like if you see that Bay if
you see that yellow line your yellow
circle on the temples that means it was
the very old one not even new yeah guys
original yep so g OG yeah the next
product yeah exactly
alright so thank you so much guys for
being on obviously we're gonna talk
about Google i/o this week there were a
lot of announcements first of all TK you
were there live in the flesh actually
why I'm the keynote happened and I kind
of wanted to ask like you were saying
that this was your first Mountain View
amphitheater I oh yeah okay yeah
definitely definitely and it's it's just
it was an experience it was an amazing
experience so last time I was there the
the I guess the the way just the inside
the entire experience was set more of a
you know we didn't have stadium seating
maybe that
that's what made it so much better in
the original back at the the original
shirt well we're back in 2013 the last
time I was there it was basically all
you know chair is in a big conference
room everybody was watching you had to
kind of look up and look around but the
stadium seating was just made it so much
better and they actually installed a
shade now I don't know if you guys like
from what we heard they learned from
last year because I was talking to Hyman
I'm talking to some of the other guys
and they're like oh yeah they put a
shape there they included sunscreen and
the little baggies they were giving out
the people we were in paint last year
yeah the last time I went was two years
ago and I remember the Sun started to
peak from behind the stage and slowly
but surely we started to see tweets of
people like I'm melting so I could
definitely see that and but the weird
thing again as you know Josh the weather
was actually kind of cool
we had overcast for a while so it was
just perfect
just you know it's like they overdid it
for that weather kind of thing yeah it
was complaining the day that I was there
as I usually do about San Francisco I'm
just not a big fan of the Bay Area but
the as I a lien a maybe like a third of
our audience but it was kind of cold up
there with the Sun still blaring down
but it's nice to see that they've made
that shade but there's still that
building right next the wall on the
campus that they're constructing that
looks like a weird like I don't know it
looks like another theater that they're
making
it's an intact yeah no no Matt I I'm not
even it just looks so big but we don't
even get a chance to get close to it but
yeah we passed it walking you see it
when you're going in it just you know
maybe future maybe by next year it looks
almost done so most of the structure
looks pretty much there yeah all right
so we're gonna get your thoughts on the
keynote in a little bit Cogan did you
watch it live live streamed nope really
oh you're you're presuming okay so why
not that like what's uh
why not because this is Google's huge
announcement for the year and obviously
it gave birth to the thing that was
leaked all to hell but yeah but you know
your thoughts on why like why didn't you
watch Akeno I do interested in what
Google had to say or why there's a few
reasons well honestly I got I was just
busy and like I was kind of running
around and doing other things and so I
was like you know I
I did what I'm sure a lot of people do
and I was like you know what I'll just
watched or read the recap later and
that's that's basically what I did and
like I'm not I don't feel like I really
miss too much like as you're talking
about this thing is like kind of the
biggest news there and we all knew
everything about it before they even
started talking um but yeah like that's
and then of course I hadn't so like I
was kind of just interested in kind of
messing with it and not you know hearing
all of the other things beforehand
before I got to like play with it yeah I
mean so the two of you so I'm not gonna
give too much information away but the
two of you were sent these phones right
so yeah well mine after the oh yeah yeah
you were at the actual yeah I was at the
event and then yeah so there was a few I
would say if you select it had access to
them a few days before yeah well okay so
what was funny was I flew back from
Mountain View from Bay Area from San
Jose and the moment I got home was one
of the keynotes started so I'm kind of
sitting here like I could have just been
sitting in that audience and then 45
minutes into the actual keynote they
were like pixel 3a available now so I
just turned it off and went straight to
Best Buy and what was funny was because
of the leak that happened from Best Buy
they were being very careful they were
like is it today go look at open tickets
today and I'm looking at them like it's
today guys it's on the stage yeah I was
like Google execs literally got on stage
20 minutes ago and said available today
and the best part was that I called
Verizon I called t-mobile first
I knew Best Buy had it everyone knew
Best Buy had it but yeah
behind the glass case exactly so I
called Verizon first I called t-mobile
next and they both said like we don't
have any of them I'm like that how like
it literally said it's available to date
how do you not have any of them in stock
no they were like I don't know corporate
just didn't send us in yeah I'm like
this is really weird so I why I went to
Best Buy but there were a lot of other
announcements that were obviously
announced on stage we were talking about
a lot of ecosystem stuff so Android
queue is something that we'll talk about
a little bit I do want to get a quick
question off to the two of you let's
have a little bit of fun at the
beginning of this cast
what do you guys think and Drake he was
gonna stand for I haven't even thought
about that
Thomas you got to be a sweet right yeah
I don't know too many sweets to start
with cube well quick was the only one
but that's a brand yeah they did that
with KitKat they'll never do that again
because they probably didn't pay for
that and there was a partnership and
also the boat also spelled Nesquik now
right isn't it like yeah and I think
it's called clear I don't know actually
in Hong Kong there is actually a candy
bar called quick ah
and it's an orange flavor version of a
KitKat so interesting but I I still feel
like that's a brand like that oh yeah
and plus it kind of looks like KitKat
again because it's great that the candy
itself is a so that's why I was like I'm
not sure there's like the queue well I
was I can't put you I was trying to put
you as an investigator TK because I
honest I asked I talked to a whole bunch
of people nobody they look they look at
me and they say huh yeah however one
Android Oh was coming out it was so
obvious because in the in the lunch area
there were just Oreos everywhere so I
was like what can what else could it be
call come on yeah this year laughr
electron if I mentioned putting that
name but but basically la croix was
everywhere so there was nothing but I
just I literally felt like I went to
dare hit to their headquarters it was
like literally like massive buckets in
them as you're walking around you almost
hit them if you don't look for them so
but there was there was no no direct
indicator of what it could be as far as
the desert because I here's no pie here
quinoa
I hear quiche none of them sound right
yeah so it I'm honestly at this so here
here is something I I did hear from
somebody saying that they when they look
at the letter Q the way Q is drawn it
kind of looks like two numbers right so
it looks like a tight like a tent right
so it kind of looks like a zero with a
na with the one through it so the
question would be is is it possible that
we may be deviating from it but I don't
know I can't figure out what Q
I don't know if they just call it ten
I'm gonna be so mad
like don't feel like Android OS 10 yeah
Android ten and they're all yeah like
and we just call it AI phone no it's
getting good yeah well before we get
into like Android and the pixel three is
going to be the anchor of this show
it'll be the last half of it
are there any reactions that you had to
the ecosystem stuff we had Google Nest
I actually just installed the nest by
the way so I'm actually totally into
this but Google nest or okay so Google
nest hub is that what they decided to
call that nest there's the nest hub and
then there's the nest hub max oh god max
okay yeah so what is it with this do you
have any like smart-home stuff like what
what what do you guys use I'm still away
from Amazon I don't use anything from
Amazon still I I have actually 90% I
would say Google based services I have
to elect to Amazon I just almost set her
name I have to Amazon assistants these
don't save name no they're both sitting
even changed my keyword on mine to be
the other one and I can't say that one
but the short answer is I have two of
them but I keep them in the office but
around the house
smart displays Google I basically I'm
very much invested in the Google
ecosystem mmm all right so the the home
hub my yeah the nest hub the bigger one
would definitely be something to
complement it like I say in the living
room or so home Google max Google home
huh Google Google home hub right and now
it's all gonna be nest nest Atomics nest
hub and all that the naming conventions
are just so ridiculous but but I'm when
I'm wondering is they didn't say
anything about renaming the existing
like Google homes right as those are
still called home home many home max so
but they took that the smart displays
which essentially is a Google home with
a display so I'm not yeah it was a
little bit confusing but yeah it looked
really nice I had a chance to play with
one so it was it's actually pretty good
and limited functionality or what they
could show us okay
do you have a home hub or some sort of
like smart display of Kogan didn't we
all get the dude we all got the Lenovo
actually I was looking at it and trying
to remember what it's called
it's the smart yeah the lenovo smart
display no I have the Google one with
the scroll the Home Hub the tiny one
just called home oh right yeah yeah I
have seen the words home hub and nest so
many times I'm confused right but yeah
it's just madly nest hub by the way
there are all synonyms home nest hub so
what the Frick well we're being
redundant on the names of these products
yeah wait so what is this now called TK
did you say this now has a different
name yeah that's what they change it
from it from the home up to the nest hub
now that's the nest home it sits under
the nest umbrella of yeah so and then
the big one is the next nest has part of
the nest yeah well it's because the
camera on the on the max is actually a
nest cam yes which makes that I like so
I like that a night and I like that yes
yes I'm looking for security cameras
from my family home and I feel like
getting one of them I actually wanted to
say like don't buy anything parents
because we'll get this big one this max
and then they were like but we want more
than one camera as ago I can't help you
there well cloud cam that's that's what
we tell them to do after that oh yeah
where you get like those those smart
they make smart cameras they're like 30
bucks that's true I did find I did find
those and you know what like as smarting
up in office has been like my project
over the last couple of weeks so for
example like if I were to I have my
smart display right here so if I were to
I don't know if you'll be able to see it
behind me uh boom there you go and then
yeah yeah oh I'm not even showing it on
camera here let me do one more time I
had it on coke in the entire time but
there you go but yeah so this holds the
the smart home stuff is starting to
become like very prevalent and with nest
actually becoming part of the Google
umbrella the the hub max TK you said
that it actually looks pretty cool the
camera yes the security camera I feel is
really awesome but did the sound do
anything for you because I remember the
Google sound was fantastic really
fantastic
oh yes no no now of course it was in a
controlled environment we were in a room
the doors were closed everything is
gonna sound great but the the overall
sound experience comparing it to the
home hub it's definitely I would say
five times louder and just fuller as far
as the sound they have two tweeters and
a woofer in the back that gives them
just more space for acoustics but it
also has a bigger speakers on it so
that's the overall just its take the
home hub sorry the nest hub and and just
literally three times bigger and used
yeah I'm gonna keep me I made a whole
bunch of mistakes in the video I think
by the end of the video that I did I was
I refer to as the home hub and a home of
Max inadvertently just reverting back to
the original names because google loves
changing the names of their products for
no reason no they came up to whoever was
in charge when you know what was so
interesting though about this key no
like I just talked about the nest we're
gonna talk about Android Kunis that game
there wasn't a whole lot else though I
feel like this was actually kind of a
bear Google i/o and they even said at
the beginning of that keynote like we're
gonna try our best to keep this editor
to ours and that's exactly what they did
it was only an hour and 40 minutes so I
was like huh
there was a few things I mean some of
the other things they covered in there
were more under the hood that you know
the Google transcribe option the you
know some of the refinements to the
Google assistant having more having it
more run locally as opposed to on the
web so those are more optimizations
which is which we expect from them
whenever they do you know software
optimizations on Android but ya know a
big big things would definitely be q3a
and nest hub max
mid nest products did you miss product
did you uncover anything during the the
sessions during like Adler like post
keno did you uncover anything while you
were running around the amphitheater in
that place I will try so hard to look
like a festival but it's so not it the
way they explained it I mean right right
and when you're walking around they make
it feel like a second experience of I
didn't so in we were able to uncover a
few things so we got a chance to play
around with the Android auto stuff that
was just kind of done wasn't even
mentioned but we knew we was coming and
then I also went into the sandbox and in
the sandbox we had access to a lot of
devices that had like early builds of
Android cue for devices that you may not
even know like the may 20 pro running
Android cue you know
EMU yr9 on top of it we saw some and I
posted that on Twitter I ran into a few
demo devices running 5g they had a 5g
station there that they were running
them and there was a certain I'm gonna
say 1 plus disguised device and I can
say 1 plus only because there was a logo
on the back of that hidden well very
well hidden device on it and it was
running you know 5g connection tests and
then they had I think a Reno there so
there was a lot of difference going on
at MU i/o exactly and it was running 5g
and and that makes me wonder which so we
they wouldn't tell me what carrier they
wouldn't let me run if to speak test and
that the name of the other ones wife
device maybe and then the the only thing
we could do with the oneplus device was
actually browsing YouTube it was locked
it was the app that the I think YouTube
app was pinned and you couldn't get out
of it so it was mostly a demo of how
fast you're able to switch or seek time
and they turn on you know stats for
geeks inside of YouTube and they let you
see the basically the latency and how
good the performance of the network is
setting that never look at yeah it but
it's actually does that talk they could
prove that you're running you know a 5g
connection as opposed to oh yeah
actually we're any that so they yeah
they had to show you the stats up so
other than that but we couldn't really
film most of it because it doesn't
really you know it was mostly just
experience kind of thing but it was
exciting it was a lot of cool things
going on I was only able to stay there
for one day unfortunately so I I didn't
get a chance to see all of the other
things on day 2 Michelle our editor at
XDA state yeah yeah yeah and also I got
to stay with the XDA guys TK and
Michelle and he had an entire house to
themselves and it was funny because Tiki
and I were gonna leave Michelle was
gonna have an entire home to himself
like exhume with the huge living room it
was a massive place yeah I know I know
it's a nice place yeah alright so
Android q well we'll get into it into
this for a little bit okay so I did a
roll call with everybody with their
pixel 3a so everyone here they have I
think the both of you have both of them
and I do Oh William just which one is
that there's only the XL baby all three
three eight okay so 3a right here and
yours looks like it's that purple issue
right it's purple-ish yeah have a
purple-ish I have the white one oh yeah
okay so I got the purplish as well in
the XL mark okay is there any reason why
you haven't do you do you normally not
try the as the unlocker how come you
don't have your android cube beta on yet
well cuz i was as soon as i got this
thing I've been filming it and I wanted
to do my day in the life which I'm
currently editing right now I gotcha
like wanted to do it in the life using
the phone like your average person would
um but ya know as soon as those there's
that video I'm gonna do the complete
walkthrough next once those are done
then I'll yeah for sure I'll be putting
Q on it and messing around with it yeah
this is beta 3 though right no that's
right yeah so you haven't used any of
the previous ones have you okay yeah its
beta 3 but its first public okay I
usually see I usually go for RC I
usually wait for RC before I even touch
any of the Android like early editions
because normally something bad happens
like I have a lot of people on my tweets
right now saying that like Google pays
not working Bank apps are not working
and that's that's a big deal so that's
one big problem
oh I just remember I just said sweets
there is one more thing I want to put
some b-roll up of this but did you guys
see sure Lynn's tweet about Android wear
or where is no no no I'm gonna put it up
on on screen right now look yeah go
ahead go ahead and try to find it and
basically you know did surely an oven
gadget sherlyn low and Kris Velasco that
both of them were there on behalf of
Engadget and she said that during a
fireside chat so try to find that one
during a fireside chat with Android
developers or whoever the Android team
was at the time they asked about where
OS and the responses were hilariously
sad like the guys who were given that
fireside chat basically said oh is there
anybody here oh oh no we didn't hear
anything about where OS and it doesn't
look like there's anything going on with
where OS right now here at Google IO is
that a problem is there something we
should know about where OS and then the
person gave him the fireside chat
basically said oh is there anybody here
from the where OS team and nobody raised
their hands and he leaned in and said
does that answer your question I was
like dang
the throne shaded themselves a fat yeah
I found it wait here hey go go read that
off you guys see that
oops wait about that does that work or
not
let me check no always tell on you okay
I was trying to share my screen but it's
not hold please
oh here we go yeah you you you're
showing your screen button tada easy now
yeah I'm gonna put the b-roll up right
now cuz using the slow this is just for
its of TK exactly oh yeah it's it's it's
ridiculous it's so but then of course
like the follow-up to this tweet the in
the thread is that somebody at the
fireside chat said oh there's somewhere
else then that's crazy
why so yeah I I've been all over the
place in terms of like well we're
talking about what Google IO but I guess
what I what I really want to ask at this
point before we get to our mid break
does this mean just like horrible things
for smartwatches because Google just
scooped up they have their nest
integration they're calling their the
products nest they even scooped up
fossil for smartwatches but to not even
have anything to say about smartwatches
or Wireless in general like this how do
you guys feel about the future of
wearables if this is how little they
gave it at a developer conference I mean
for me with so many things going on
honestly I actually forgot about where
is it I'm not trying to that's my point
and for the most part I haven't been
using whereas I switched back to Tizen
mostly because of just the the ecosystem
in the battery life if nothing else but
yeah it's it's interesting to see that
they're not trying to put more focus on
it that we haven't seen a lot of updates
coming up and a lot of the delimitations
and the new things that we talked about
as far as you know with new where OS 2.0
and even 2.2 coming out to some certain
devices it we haven't heard much it's
been quiet ever since around CES really
I mean it's been roughly about five
months now that's the last time I think
we talked about like 2.1 or even 2.2
yeah I mean
I wonder there's two minds for this
right either there's they're just like
scared and I want to talk about it or
there's maybe they're working on
something and they're like let's back
off until that's ready and like you know
version three or whatever the heck will
come out I hope so well so keep in mind
that some of the things they showed us a
data i/o were very much early earlier
stages of things like the I went through
a demo of the new assistant option where
they talked about the better integration
on the device where it runs at the
bottom of you display and that was
actually pretty much almost like a
pre-recorded video very limited in
functionality very early early and I
would have left to see if they were
thinking about doing a revamp I mean
they revamped Android auto the entire UI
for the most part it's going to be
revamped more Android ST I would say you
know like an app drawer Notification
Center something that we normally don't
have day tiles happened right before
Google i/o so the idea of swiping left
and right rather than cards god I always
hated cards this is the worst idea for
like something that supposed to be quick
but yeah okay so Android cue Cogan I'm
sorry we haven't had a whole lot for you
to talk about in this particular segment
pixel 3a though once we get enjoying the
mumble we get back from the break though
we're gonna talk pixel three I want to
get your extended thoughts on this phone
but yeah Android Q since TK and I are
the ones who are actually using it some
thoughts from you TK about Android Q
coming from the XDA side of things like
any anything that you want to sort of
share any thoughts that you want to give
because my my main hot take is I still
hate full screen gestures but okay it's
mostly what we did with Android clear at
this point there's a lot of new things
coming up as far as just the gesture
overall they're I think they're still in
the stages of figuring out I don't know
as we remember this is not the final
product so this isn't and you know we
can't really criticize it to its fullest
till they put this in a final version
but they are at least allowing us to
well they're trying to basically
centralize or basically unify the
ecosystem right they're pretty much
trying to force almost all OMS to use
one certain type of gestures which
really makes me sad because I love
one plus gestures that's just my thing
and I actually even
emui gestures are actually pretty decent
which is basically that you you go
backwards by going off the sides exactly
and and what what the other thing that
was really nice for in my opinion at
least still is the fact that we got the
the navigation buttons back that was
something that we lost before so yeah so
as Josh is showing you just have Swiper
and then tried that 45 degree angle
swipe from the bottom
what do you mean 45 like from the corner
yeah swipe up diagonal Oh what I didn't
know that my bad I was just about to
complain about like there's no way to
get straight to a Google assistant you
just taught me okay learn something
every single day or you know yeah
exactly
okay no yeah nobody talked about it
right so you for the most part and it's
not even in the instructions when you're
going through the option when you turn
on gestures right you skip to the
instructions none of them say go
diagonal and suddenly you're launching
the assistant but that's also so
complicate like okay part of the reason
why I hate fullscreen gestures is
because there's so much room for error
like so I know that I can hit a button
and it will get me so recent apps I know
that I can you know go here go there and
that's the other reason why I don't
actually don't really like the one plus
gestures because it's to the sides of
the middle which already sounds
ridiculous to me by yeah to go backwards
you have to go from like the 30% of this
side or this side if you're from the
middle you go home and it's like ah and
even now like I have problems where
where I'm trying to swipe up from
somewhere and I end up going home like
if I was on Reddit and I try to swipe up
to scroll down the page I go home and
like yes well because the actual bar at
the bottom is actually a bar it's a very
small portion of the display but it's an
actual bar that's just very very thin so
in reality you always have to remember
to kind of start a little bit above but
yeah you're inevitably you're going to
initiate basically just let's put this
our navigation has to happen in this
zone right here so if you go too far to
the right to farts that left you're
going back if you go too far below
you're going into your app drawer or to
your recent apps or swipe they're
swiping back and forth to the different
apps like that's fine I can I can get
using I like that actually yeah it's
very nice and it's pretty smooth it
makes way more sense than the stupid
pill
you know it I think the pill was more of
a visual effect so that people knew
where put their finger kind of thing but
that you know PI and in the early
versions of Q kinda got us used to that
so as long as you're used to the pill
effect that's when you minimize it so
you don't know we're here where'd I put
their finger when they had buttons what
was wrong with that everyone's so
obsessed with having so much screen hey
remember the argument that you and I had
Josh gestures versus buttons yeah I'm
always protesters I'm always for buttons
yeah okay I don't know if you ever saw
that but hewan had us on for one of his
debates and he had TKB on the side of
gestures and I was on the side of
buttons and I love we're talking about
soft buttons it was actually you know
hard you know like physical buttons we
were talking about the key so yeah yeah
of course
so who won I don't think anyone really
won like okay nobody I I was complaining
at the end because it's so hard to get
well you know yit he could just try to
be like you know what Android went to
gestures I won I just have to wait
that's all well this money was a lot of
people in the live chat already thought
that I lost because my my exhibit a was
the BlackBerry kita yeah you went for
like real bone yeah exactly
and then but then I I redeemed myself by
saying T cage tell me what keyboard
you're using and then I was when I was
like tactile that's right it you gotta
go from mechanical mechanical keepers
all the way yeah it's but I love you
travel set up to as well but you know
it's it was it to me I think I feel like
gestures I think are going to be the way
mostly well actually there was other
things that were talking about during
the developer conference it was it that
they - they're trying to actually start
looking at the options of not just using
air gestures so you notice how they did
that would be nest right the whole
there's functionality with air gestures
on that everyone's getting an yeah so
there's I mean if they reach up right
here and change my nest like this
because it's right there if I could do
that then I'm down but no again so there
are things that are good there that will
start using gesture to interact with
basically you know Things IOT
stuff so there's going to be other
things coming on and I feel like they
feel like gestures on the screen is
limiting air gestures are going to be
the next thing so well my problem that
though is alike air gestures look
ridiculous
rightly know especially when people are
around you right yes this is like you're
telling me they're doing IOT stuff with
that fine
because that's in the privacy of my own
home like mm-hmm
this looks ridiculous I don't care what
you to my eye great like it's I don't
try to have though like okay so you live
in New York you live in New York
obviously you're in Brooklyn Kogan what
if you get on the subway and everyone is
just like that they're just like
everyone's sitting on the subway just
mmm doing nothing you don't want that
nobody in their right mind would do that
well we had that it'll never have some
point I forgot that there was at certain
stage they they used to initiate that
for skipping images they're using the
front-facing camera there we've had that
and we surpassed that and it did not
take no fly away every single time you
wants to look at a picture I'm sorry
they just look ridiculous that's it's
the promise to czar like it's not worth
it doesn't actually make things faster
right like because the only time we've
ever really used air gestures and sure
like maybe there's something I haven't
thought of that it would be cool for
billing it's always to do something that
I could easily do instead of this it
doesn't this is not have to get closer
to it yeah this are you right if only I
could do from here four inches yeah for
in terms of distance anyway sorry that's
my I definitely think it's a the the
approach they did with the nest the nest
of max sorry I gotta slow myself there
any more about that the interface was
mostly the only thing they were able to
demo for us right now was essentially a
pause and play but it worked there was a
couple of things they had facial
recognition on the head on the home max
I'm just gonna refer to it as the max
from that's right yeah
so they initiated profile recognition on
the max as well as personalized items so
you no longer have to have your let's
say if you have a family obviously and
you have multiple people in the living
room but you don't want your personal
calendar events and all of that stuff to
show up on it you set it up by a profile
so any time you're in front of it it
recognizes you and it puts a picture on
the top right and at that point your
personal information is there and the
moment you step away and it stopped
seeing you all of that goes away it just
goes like a default mode and that was
genius and the the gestures for the most
part is asically you just you put your
hand as long as you're centered in front
of it and there's good lighting you put
your hand in front of it it pauses you
put it again it starts again it's great
if you're in the kitchen you're cooking
your hands are dirty you're playing with
the kids you don't want to have to go
over there or scream and it's like you
know say the hey command and it was
definitely very less busy work out of
the three of us TK is the only one who
can actually attest to that experience
right wait so so wait what how far away
does it work like he was about a bet say
maybe a foot and a half his hand was
about a foot a half away and it was
actually he was overall really good it
worked right away he just lit was about
maybe a half a second and it recognized
and it paused the music and then he just
looked again puts his hand and it does
the exact same thing no no flippin
gestures yet mostly just it recognizing
a hand in front of it and I think it
just looks at the shape as long as it
look like something that's similar
because the camera didn't look like it
was using any other technology other
than just being a camera it was a
wide-angle lens or anything no no no as
a single sensor no but they did have you
extra tricks there as well so they use a
wide-angle lens but they crop it in the
in the sensor so that a simulate a
movement kind of like how we saw it on
the Facebook what is it called the
Facebook can be either portal where you
know the entire thing moves well this
one what it does it just changes focus
so it moves within the frame simulating
it but it worked you know overall I'm
very very impressed with the way they
did it it's it looks like a it's a much
better product than what we saw with the
original smart displays how about the
how about the stop thing then they do
that where you do both there making it
now so that you don't have to be saying
hey
gee or okay yeah so much which continues
conversation yeah exactly which at which
I'm personally appreciated of only
because I'm always around my parents
when they try to use our Google home and
they're actually trying to have a
conversation with it like to ask it a
question it answers and they go thank
you and I'm like you're saying thank you
to an inanimate object also you need to
say okay gee thank you wake it up again
to tell it again but that's the thing
we've had for a long time in well
continues conversation I was I didn't
have to I don't have to say that yeah at
all to Amazon I can you can facilities
like the blue light on it just stays lit
when you're done talking and that
indicates to you that you can keep
asking and eventually fades off so if
you keep asking it'll just keep going
it's not obviously as good as Google
when it comes to like context awareness
I was gonna say there's the data and
like that's not really you know Amazon I
can't do that but but it does have that
like more natural way of talking so like
I'm happy it's finally coming to to
Google because that's it's just now I'm
so used to doing that with Amazon that I
do it so we've had continuous
conversation on Google for for a while
but it's mostly been no I actually I
want to say it's been on the Google home
I actually did a video asking at 107
questions like a road oh yeah yeah it
continuous asking 107 questions I had my
son onto that one because I wanted to
see how how far can I go right I mean
it's like you can have maybe one or two
three maybe but as long as you didn't go
into a yes or no or a specific like a
something that was more than a yes or no
I take that back it's more if you ask it
like so yeah to answer you something
that's a little bit long it for some
reason loss thing but as long as you
kept short questions and commands like
you can combine things we've had it for
some time and but is that just for
asking questions or you could also say
like a G turn on that light yep you
could do that on top of you and let's
say you wanted to play music you can
tell it to play the song set the volume
and then turn on it go
to tell it to turn the lights on in this
room turn off the lights and that saying
okay G without having saying it as those
are is now new no because I've not been
able to do that on mine maybe I just
haven't what what the new thing about it
was that now it's computationally being
done on device yeah Oh gone faster
that's what yeah and that's what they
demoed on it the girl was on like spit
firing questions one after another and
I'm like wow and at the end she showed
us she was on Wi-Fi yeah
so it was like but like the way that
they presented on stage I like that a
lot because it was showing what you were
saying beside the pill which oh the
transcribe function yeah which I thought
was great because like you'd be able to
see in real-time contextually based upon
what app you're in how your voice and
how what you're saying actually applies
to what you're trying to do which made
perfect sense to me I loved it that part
of the keynotes by the only part that I
really enjoyed because I want to use
that I personally do like I've been
hearing a lot of people recently like
complain about I when I was picking up
this pixel 3a and we're gonna get to our
mid break in a second one when I was
picking up the pixel 3a there was
actually somebody talking to a Best Buy
Mobile like like sales person and was
like what's this button over here on the
side like I never use it should i and
the guy goes that's big speed never use
it and and she's like is it like Siri is
it like Siri and he was and the guy was
like yeah it's like Siri in that you
shouldn't use it if you're usually like
just using just use Google and I was
like damn like okay but you know what I
fit that description I've never used
Siri I'd never use Bigsby it's always
about Google assistants so when they
were saying those things on stage I was
like let's do it Google assistant you
know let's do it this episode of the
weekly is brought to you by the brave
browser available now for all platforms
including Android iOS Windows and Mac
the brave browser is up to 8 times
faster than Chrome yeah it is based on
chromium so all of your plugins work it
blocks ads out of the box and if you opt
in to brave rewards you can earn free
b80 cryptocurrency by allowing the
browser to show you occasional high
quality non intrusive ads so I've been
using brave browser for a long time by
now I actually have it on all of my
computers I did a video on pocket now
regarding
why I like the brave browser and it
really comes down to this one scream
where it tells you all of the ads and
all of the trackers that has blocked I
don't know what's going on in the
internet right now that I have over
400,000 ads blocked but that's the
number I have so brave browser must be
doing a pretty good job in any case you
can head over to packing.com slash brave
for more information now we can get into
it I'm sure a lot of people are wanting
to know more and more about this crazy
I'm gonna call it a crazy device that
was just announced by Google everyone's
talking about the pixel three a and A
three Axl what I call the three axle and
the it is a reacts well actually if you
really yeah exactly
so Cogan since we haven't heard from you
too much in the first segment I want to
get your extended thoughts about like
how you feel about this phone you're
doing a day in the life today so I'm
sure you have a lot of thoughts on it
yeah I like this phone I I'm my biggest
thing just to like cut to the chase
right like is I feel like this has the
good things of the pixel three and some
of the bad things but I'm Way more
forgiving of the bad things and I'm way
more excited about the good things
because it's half the price hmm like I'm
having a hard time and maybe you guys
tell me like I don't know I've only
literally had a day with it so hear me
out
but and like film the entire day but
like I I don't really know who I would
recommend to like if you were thinking
about getting a pixel like a three I
would probably tell you to get the 3a
and not the three and I don't know and
maybe you guys tell me again why you
would tell somebody get the three
instead of three except for gaming
that's the only thing because the
processor is not it's like the frame
rates are not gonna be the same Oh
doesn't that using day-to-day stuff like
it seems very similar if not the same a
little slightly lang here but not bad
like I wouldn't yeah and then I can give
you a couple of tips on to why some of
that lag is in there but yeah Josh do
you want to try that one first do you
want me to well I will say this like I
do think that okay for $400 there is
it's gosh it's so hard to not recommend
this phone to pretty much anybody so she
sends the majority the vast majority of
the people and correct me if I'm wrong
for the three of us that are in this
podcast the vast majority of the people
that we have in our lives don't actually
need to be spending
much on the phone because they're not
gonna do the gaming they're not going to
do the they're not videographers or
filmmakers or photographers on the level
that we are where we require all of
these crazy things and phones sometimes
you just want a phone that works and
most people still have like some of the
peripherals that most flagships are
starting to sort of put by the wayside
like a headphone jack and like it's it's
it's great to see a back-to-basics
approach I remember when all of the
leaks were coming out for the pixel 3a I
was scoffing the entire time I think it
was last week that I actually said like
do we need another pixel and everyone
was like by now we have a $400 phone
that actually gets so many things right
and I treated the other day that I think
that this phone is a great palate
cleanser also I noticed that no one
caught that I spelled palate wrong but
it's a total powder room yeah now they
now I'm gonna get to eat or everybody
yeah
but yeah I think it's a total palate
cleanser because not not to get into any
of the stuff that's still under embargo
obviously I just want to say that right
now it's such an in such an exciting
time for phones but it's also very
overwhelming so I I'm happy to have a
phone that is just like here you go
like just use me just use me I got you
covered
it's all good like if you don't if you
don't ask too much of me I will give you
everything you need like that's how I
feel about the pixel 3 and I love it I
absolutely love that about it gaming
you're right Kogan and I think TK you're
going to talk a little bit about the
performance aspect my favorite games lag
on this phone and it does it keep me
from playing them no you can still play
these games no problem it's just if you
didn't already have a phone that was so
good at performing oh so good at
performance for those games you wouldn't
notice it's just a little bit more of a
pause that is inconceivable to most
people unless you have a flagship right
next to it so yeah ok no uh the some of
the some of the some of the things that
you know a tribute to the slightly
slower performance is the fact that we
also have emmc type storage in here
we're not using ufs the same as other
devices there's there's quite a bit of
compromises that we're done a lot of us
so what I've also a lot of what I
thought about it after I saw the phone
the first couple of days and i
realistically started looking at it I
know we inadvertently want to compare it
to the three and the three XL right
because those are the two that kind of
shared the same name but I feel like
this is a different category this is
more because they didn't read it because
I'm gonna say you know we didn't really
compromise it's not downgrading it
started off with the 670 it's a new
category we don't have an actual
presence to it this is just it's similar
in name because they just didn't want to
invent a new name in the middle of the
year because we'll still see the fours
and we'll see the DD for Excel for where
do I have date for what they have to
offer for four hundred bucks or four
seventy depending on the model it
definitely is the device that most
people will if they get will be very
happy with it if you are used to having
a Ferrari and you drive a regular car
you're gonna feel things are slower but
if you're driving your car and your car
is just basically like a Honda or you
know your normal Toyota Honda and so on
there's nothing wrong with them and
getting into this car will definitely
feel very comfortable and pleasantly
surprised as far as performance and
camera because I think that's the little
hidden thing a lot of us when you
recommend to people they say how does
the audio how does it play it has stereo
speakers it has a headphone jack it does
have you know a very good camera not as
many microphones but you know in the in
the comparison and the US market right
now we don't have another option this is
actually its own category so where do
you by the way that whole car analogy
Cogan can't really relate it's a subway
guy it's like going on the bullet train
in the train to the El train so huge we
we've been you know I feel like we've
been lucky enough to be able to you know
enjoy and use the the me obviously the
higher performance vehicles and/or the
higher performance devices and it is
easy for us to compare but the reality
is this is its own category it's not a
nexus it's it's not it's an our standard
pixel but it's Google's approach to say
look we're gonna give you some of the
best software's that we can but I'm not
a better price point that you can get
into and if you want more and you want
some of those extra perks we
have the higher end so my question still
is who's this for no no no like I
understand that I'd like to call us a
new category I don't if I totally agree
with that like it's in a mid tier like
all the other mid-range is a way better
job at software and camera right pure
yet that's a killer in that category as
far as I'm concerned what like what
about you know like if I still don't
know if somebody was like I'm gonna get
a pixel three I might be like you're
only getting that cuz you want the
camera right yeah all right here save
Jeff four hundred dollars
like I don't write like unless they're
gonna Kane that's the only thing I said
any other time that you'd be like you
should get the three and not the three
that's what I want so where do you where
do I land on like Google because the way
that I I just out of this right now
but it feels like Google's trying to
redeem the sins of the pixel three like
let's call them sins let's just say what
it is because there are cues in this
phone there's no knotch that's a
headphone jack what else is there and I
actually don't agree with many people
out there who say that the build of this
thing is cheap yes it's plastic but once
upon a time $800 phones were all plastic
so like yeah get off your high horse
like that does nothing just feels really
nice like it the only way that I know
that the three feels better is if I have
the two of them side-by-side that's
exactly what happened to me yeah this my
hell that I had both yeah it's when you
draw the comparison is when you start
having like well well look at it by
itself
take it as its own this is nice yeah
yeah it's absolutely yeah and you know
what I also said I made sure to get the
smaller one because because honestly
I've been always picking the big ones I
have that 10 I have the iPhone 10s max I
have the pixel three XL now Scott I'm
kind of sick of big phones if I'm if I'm
absolutely honest like I totally get
that everyone wants like all of this
screen that's why gestures are a thing
that's why curved displays are a thing
that's why notch lists phones or
mechanical front-facing cameras or
whatever you want to call like the reno
like i get it those are all such
beautiful phones but come on
like if it's really hard for me to
switch what account I'm using on Gmail
it doesn't detract from the overall
experience and that's that's just my
thing maybe I got small hands I'm giving
everyone on Twitter a bunch of fodder to
make fun of media today maybe I got
small hands but you know what like there
are people out there with small hands
alright so who cares but yeah I I
personally am so happy with with with
the experience that I've had so far
like did either of you do camera
comparisons just yet with the original
pixel or with any other phones like
where do you that okay so Cogan's yeah
that's your bread and butter yeah
exactly
so what were some what were some what
did you find out in that testing or any
sneak peeks you can give us yeah exactly
yeah so like I'm still literally like as
soon as we're done here I'm running back
to my office to finish editing this
video um but like so far like it it's so
we are missing the Google where they
call it visual the visual core is not
there yeah we it's not there but like
putting that put this the photos from
this side by side with the three and
you'd have a hard time telling like this
it's it's like 95% there and so like
that's pretty again cool to me and again
like further fuels this whole like I'm
not sure why you'd get a pixel three but
yeah I mean in and that's the same
camera that's always kind of you know
kind of eat down against all of the
other cameras anyway right like and and
yes it like over not over processes it
does what it thinks a photo editor would
do to the photo immediately and that's
why a lot of us would look at it and
straight out of the camera go this looks
better to me um and they do a good job
of that with their software yeah but
like yeah I mean that's this one does
the same thing as the regular pixel so
like I don't know that's that's amazing
for 400r Jesus do you miss having other
lenses cuz that's another thing the
pixel is like pretty squarely the only
phone that has the one lens and is like
we got this yes I do
I like having multiple lenses because
well because also people like us they're
used to having multiple lenses on a real
camera and we're like having a telephoto
where I can actually like zoom in and
out and not like you know pinch-to-zoom
pixelated crap
I do miss that yeah for sure but what I
mean honestly if you take the photo with
this it's still like the end of the day
like the photo that comes out of this if
you yes you have less framing options
right but like the photo that comes out
is still gonna look really damn good yes
so as long as you can find any of the
moment guys out in IO did you the
Marlins go I did see it is usually
around for these things I remember when
the pixel 3 was announced they were
giving away cases on this phone let's
help you out you know like I love those
guys but yeah I should maybe look into
some omen lenses too because that's kind
of cool yeah totally I don't know if yet
for this but I do have a solution for
that that I'm not gonna say here but
I'll talk about some other time but in
any case the yeah right
so when lens also on the front so there
were a number of tweets and Instagram
posts saying that the wide-angle lens on
the pixel 3 about the 3a because there's
they don't have it here people kind of
miss it and I get where that's coming
from but like this is a level of
attention to detail that I feel Google
has been missing for a little while the
fact that they don't have a wide-angle
lens on the front but they made sure
that this lens was right in the middle
of the focal length of the two lenses
yeah I was like two millimeters off of
both super cool like III don't know why
but that made me smile I was like cool I
like that I was like you got me
[Laughter]
today any thoughts on the on the phone
you have well you have both so like do
you have do you have a preference
between the larger one and the three a I
so I personally like the the larger one
for a couple of reasons the display but
also the battery we there's a big
difference between battery on both of
these guys the three the small one I
think you guys have is like 3000
milliamps and the other ones like 3,700
so it's yeah so to me I I I really find
it very interesting how such a small bit
difference can bump it up so high but
the overall battery life has been really
good we're running it with Android Q for
the last you know actually as I got it
out of the box I just put Q on it right
away because the experience for me I
wanted to see some of the new like the
transcribe functionality some of the
stuff that they talked about I
and it's really nice I think overall for
for what it offers I think it's a great
phone that I have no problem
recommending for the price point nothing
against again like you guys were saying
if you want the horsepower you have the
three in the three XL but if you if
you're just an average user kind of like
a I would say like a Chromebook almost
experience you don't need the full PC
setup it definitely does a really good
job I like it and and I like some of the
new features it does run a little bit
smoother on cue in my opinion at least
then when it ran on pipe just what are
they yeah
someone's calling me I'm the host and
I'm the one messing up today podcast man
silence and things where is that I don't
even know where that's coming from hold
on yeah okay cool all right so it's
funny um
total tangent but yesterday when I was
driving back home from my office there
was an Amber Alert going off and I
couldn't reach the phone in my trunk so
it had that really really uh
uncomfortable buzz going off for like a
20 minute drive it was bad all right
sorry about that guys
okay I want to add wait is that who just
called you it was 800 number so I have
to do with the AMBER Alert I thought
maybe like the lost person finally
called you gonna say the one less
wrinkled I wanted to add to this though
because we are we're all pretty much in
agreement that this is this is a pretty
compelling device especially at its
price point Google is basically doing
the Xiaomi thing and creating a phone
and selling it at the cost because I
would imagine that this phone is roughly
400 ollars to make maybe viously less
than that but it's what my point is it's
not a $700 phone with $400 specs so yeah
but here's the thing I just mentioned
Xiaomi I see a lot of people that were
talking on my pixel 3a unboxing video
saying like the problem with this phone
is that it only really makes sense
the West it's a 400 ala phone everyone's
going to be recommending it in Canada in
the US but here in like Southeast Asia
in India we have so many phones that are
even cheaper than this and so many
phones that are just a little bit more
expensive than this that provide way way
more but they're just talking about
specs like at the end of the day I mean
this I think this because I had the same
things in my comments to like this phone
for $400 is gonna provide a killer
software and camera right like that to
me is you know it gives it like a little
bit of a step up on the Yummy's of the
world like I'm sorry years of support
security that's right like and cue
coming and like I don't know there's
there I think this is now like the pixel
for outside of the West in a way right
like I think it's probably what they're
going after because you're there as like
as far as the West is concerned anywhere
that has like subsidized phones like we
all do this is $15 a month the real the
real pixel pixel three is you know 22
seven right so like it's not pixel for
us either because for you $7 you might
as well get the high-end whatever like
nobody ever buys the low tier phone in
the United States right because it's so
easy to get to the next tier it doesn't
matter yeah you look an iPhone is $30
for the iPhone 10 right 10s right so I
don't know I don't know if I agree with
that I think I think this phone stands
out on its own and $400 phone I think it
competes with those other guys no CK no
you you do you do a lot of work with
like the the honors of the world in the
huawei we all do just work with the law
ways of the world when then unless you
know I think about Huawei doesn't
necessarily have a budget phone but
Xiaomi there's one they do the honor and
both honor and why we do have the budget
line it's the kyod the best way to
describe it's what we used to get here
in the US the ex model like you know the
7x da the 6x and the 5x Alaska like the
last few devices they released Huawei
has a summer one I forgot the name of it
but it's a similarly basically but that
one's was in the mid Ranger that's more
of a budget budget friendly like the 200
the sub $200 a category yeah I think I
think what David has with the approach
you're right you have to look at it from
the sense of the it's kind of like the
service plan right you're not just
buying the car you're buying car
how long can you get it keep it running
not having the ability of getting the
upgrade from you know PI to Q and the
security updates and so on beyond the
first year beyond the second year and
going into the third year does kind of
factor in the overall price of a phone
if you're considering to keep it more
than a year obviously you know you have
to kind of look what you're trying to
get is it a direct I would say it's not
different I wouldn't say it's
necessarily a shoe-in for outside
markets like Asia and specifically in
India because it's actually more
expensive weird enough it's not four
hundred the equivalent of that I think I
saw him wearing one of my response was
more expensive it's almost like
important whatever I'm assuming it's
somebody their taxes or so on but it
actually cost more and that's why people
are comparing it to the Xiaomi of all
all things I see that in the comments
and tweets I think I think the last one
that I saw actually was in India it's
the equivalent of 575 exactly yeah it
was over 500 all over there to us for
the 3/8 yeah yeah so it makes its its no
it doesn't make sense right so for them
it's it's a little bit harder it's still
cheaper than if you had to go with the
regular pixel but when you look at it
from the overall experience and how much
their pocket is having to take you know
responsibility for yeah I can see why
they'd have a hard time but it you have
to use it you have to see the camera you
have to use the and realize what you're
getting for that in with the back up
behind it and all the improvements
because we will get more improvements I
think there's also a new video mode
time-lapse that's coming out to a
specifically the 3a have it yeah yeah it
just came and it's gonna well yeah other
devices will have it soon but and I saw
just that like I totally agree with you
like I think that's that's something
they have to think about also the
software is better right like I'm sorry
like Johnny specs amazing yeah really
cool and it's like you know five
something right that's cool but like I
don't know like I'd still this camera is
gonna do a better job period I don't
care what Sony sensor you're using right
like this is just out if you're just
like out of the box taking a photo boom
like this is still gonna do better than
a lot of those and then also software
wise like I would much
then like any of those all right even
wise gotten better like let me not say
Mui but like some of those other ones I
like there there you eyes are trash and
on that you have a fair point like like
they're a little probably more geared
towards those specific tastes of other
markets then say these are agreed
totally yeah but like even like
performance wise this is this is smooth
compared you know I don't know I like
stock Android we're gonna call this
stock ender it's not but yeah beautiful
launcher basically it's all yeah yeah I
agree
i I've come to really enjoy some of the
other operating systems though but then
again the ones that we really enjoy are
starting to become more available so I
mean I guess what I'm about to say it's
kind of moot but like oxygen OS oxygen
OS we tend to yeah oxygen that's where
my favorite ones that's not pixel yeah I
actually like that it's minimal I don't
know million yeah I actually like me you
I now I yeah I used to hate it too EMU I
still not a fan oh just got better
yeah that's true yeah angry no no all
right go find a choice like this UI over
that you might yeah for sure alright
cool well it looks like we're all pretty
much in agreement with when it comes to
the pixel 3a all enjoying it so far but
of course it's not the only phone that
we're hearing a lot more of in these
coming weeks can't talk about them but
there's a lot coming like everyone we're
all gonna be traveling one way or
