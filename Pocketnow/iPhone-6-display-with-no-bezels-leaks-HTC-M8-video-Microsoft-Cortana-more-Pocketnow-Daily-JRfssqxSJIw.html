bezels even though we kind of doubt it
the HTC m8 gets shown on video and it
includes a drama story and believe it or
not no kid doesn't want the windows
modern UI on its nokia X I'm hina Rivera
and the cool thing about stolen phones
is that there's Sex Lies and videotape
in the drama this is out daily
Romania addition the sources they
offered some official news as this is
kind of interesting Nokia is famous for
saying how beautiful the live tiles on
Windows Phone are but then again if you
see the design guidelines behind the
nokia X the company is being very
specific they are not suggesting that
you use the modern UI for developing
applications for the nokia X and their
whole Android store which is really
interesting they're actually pushing for
the Android design and the whole Android
Q as they're considering the horizontal
design of the Windows Phone modern UI to
be kind of confusing and inefficient so
it's really interesting to see what is
happening between nokia and microsoft
given the fact that nokia now belongs to
microsoft now speaking of Windows Phone
we get the first leaked screenshots of
Cortana which is going to be their voice
assistant for Windows Phone we didn't
get it at the event announcement for
Windows Phone 8.1 but we were expecting
a whole 3d like design and all we get us
two circles a couple of suggestions
we're expecting for katana to be much
smarter than what we get in serie and
you know Google now expecting Microsoft
to be a more of a software company but
again we could be wrong let's see what
we get is apparently this is not yet
finished now let's talk about apple in
the iphone 6 week at the first leaked
photos of the digitizer of the iphone 6
apparently and this is very interesting
as you don't see any bezels on this
display but we are all calling this a
fake it's really easy for you to just
scrape the paint off and make it look
like whatever you want from an iphone 5
and you'll see that both displays are
actually being compared in the photo now
that being said you know that Apple is a
prototyping company they do a lot of
tests we did see a bigger chassis
recently and hopefully if the company
wants to keep the one-handed usability
available then this is a good option we
just don't know they're going to follow
this route and speaking of ample let's
talk about their new strategies the
company seems to be stealing engineers
from HTC and even some locals from
Shanghai in their new building as the
company is apparently working on
bringing us more
iphone models every year we do see
Samsung's vomit of smartphones every
year and obviously the company is being
pressured to give us more devices even
though we don't know if that's the
smartest way to do it obviously Apple
has always been reluctant to give us
more than one iphone and then last year
we got the iphone 5c and iphone 5s so
let's see if the company is planning to
do multiple launches during the year as
they've already done it with the iPad
and finally for the hot if we could call
it hot news of the day we get the first
leaked video of the HTC m8 we were kind
of skeptical of covering this because
there was a lot of drama behind the
story and I was still developing
somebody got a hand of the phone they
found the full video of everything you
can expect about it even though a lot of
the video was actually a lot in the test
this person did to it it does seem to be
real as apparently this person is
already being threatened by HTC and
there seems to be an investigation
ongoing and this is really interesting
obviously there is a lot of drama behind
this lecture the description for full
details on what to expect but that leads
me to the question of the day watch the
video and tell us what you think about
this probable HTC m8 i mean the reviewer
wasn't even able to see if the dual
lenses had a purpose but to be honest
with you in my particular case i look at
this video and i really do want this
device at the scene very compelling that
looks a lot like the HTC One but that
was actually a good thing leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news early before this video
is film if you follow us on packing our
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
