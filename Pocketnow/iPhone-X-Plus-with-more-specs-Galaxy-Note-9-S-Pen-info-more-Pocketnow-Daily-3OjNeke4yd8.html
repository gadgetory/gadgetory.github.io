amp up more powerful specifications for
its next iPhone or at least one we get
confirmation that there are new things
coming to the S Pen on August 9th and it
seems that the Galaxy X is happening
after all and Samsung really wants to
play with that battery I'm high metal
Iveta happy 4th of July to everybody in
the States and also thank you for your
support in the pocket now in espanol
channel thank you for subscribing
there's a link at the end of the video
to show you direct access to that
channel this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals as
a prime Day is coming up and definitely
what are the phones that we recommend
most is the huawei mate 10 Pro 16th of
July is when you can expect the deals
it's pretty much dropping to 500 bucks
and that's extremely worth that you can
learn more about the deal in the
description I'll start about the samsung
galaxy note 9 there are some benchmarks
emerging on what to expect for this
phone first of all unlock units will not
just bring the qualcomm snapdragon 845
apparently there is an EXO those 98 10
variants as well unlocked by the way and
apparently it's for different regions
that could also include the United
States and we also hear of color options
we're definitely black coral blue is
gonna be part of it there's a color
that's called copper in addition to the
lilac purple that we've seen and also
silver which markets are getting these
colors the Pens will keep you posted now
let's talk about the samsung galaxy x i
know i've been boring you with rumors of
this foldable phone but bear with me
here
it seems that samsung was able to figure
out how to get a foldable battery on
this thing and we might be getting up to
a six thousand milliamp hour power pack
and that's actually not necessarily new
we see huge batteries on ipads right now
so yeah
why not we'll see what we get in the end
and for those of you that we're
wondering if we are getting Bluetooth
functionality or not on the s-pen it
just got spilled by the FCC there is a
certification for the s-pen so yes
bluetooth is coming the question is what
for let us know in the comments of what
features you would like to see on the
s-pen with bluetooth 1 &amp;amp; 2 definitely
are you willing to actually charge the
things
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the iPhone 10 2018 and we
assume we're talking about the plus
variant we know that iPhones have been
slow to adopt more RAM up to the point
where the iPhone 10 cost $1000 it only
has three gigs when you can get eight
gigs on Android and let's not even make
this a discussion of which phone does
what's better think about it is there
are rumors that at least one variant of
the iPhone 10 2018 brings four gigs of
RAM and we're assuming it's the plus the
biggest question and the question for
today would be why like why is it there
is more I'm on the larger variance what
added functionality do you think Apple
is going to bring here and in my case I
don't think it's gonna be more than just
the display being able to rotate little
math but leave us a comment down below
