on the g5 some new league show was the
possible design of the next Moto G an
apple has finally decided to provide
details on WWDC I'm hi Mary then i'm
reporting now from shenzhen china so
with Aoife GPC and I even lost my jacket
on the trip over here this is parking
out daily the official news today sort
of have to do with Amazon's Alexa
services as well we've got this M cocoa
watch that's the right now in an
IndieGoGo campaign four hundred sixty
dollars and the reason why the
SmartWatch is special is because it uses
Amazon's Alexis services in order to be
able to interact with the user it's
definitely a smart idea even though
we've been able to talk to smartwatches
for a bit that hasn't really taken off
hopefully Alexa can do something better
about and for those of you that are
wondering exactly when it's Apple having
its next event will mark your calendars
jun 13th is when WWDC is happening I
have to remember this is the company's
Worldwide Developer Conference we
usually get new software at this event
but we do know that the company is
desperate to read them hardware like in
the case of the Apple watch so this
might be the event for that we'll see
and speaking of the Apple watch some
very controversial measures have a
couple of developers in trouble if you
remember the reserve strap the whole
concept was to use the internal port of
the Apple watch to be able to provide
you with some extra battery life well it
seems that Apple has now blocked access
to that port meaning that well that
strap doesn't work and probably any
other third party accessory we still
haven't really figured out what that
whole portis for and Apple hasn't really
provided details but hopefully wwc will
reveal more now let's move the spotlight
over to lenovo or motorola as we've got
the first leaked photos of the next
generation moto g and well the most
interesting part about this design is
just how different it is starting with
the fact that there is a fingerprint
scanner on a mid-tier phone as the Moto
G and well it's at the front and it's
got this very horrible square design and
then the back pretty much resembles
everything we've seen from Motorola and
the
past the very interesting new flash
designed for the camera we can expect
some of that to reach the next Moto X
though hopefully they get a better
fingerprint scanner and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
LG g5 as its friends are now available
the company struggled a little to get
these products through FCC certification
these are now there and there's a look
at this recurrent full details on which
country support which products in which
don't these are very compelling from the
LG camp plus to the audio DAC to the 360
VR and the camera these are good
products but we would love to know in
the comments down below are you buying
any of these friends and if so or if not
would you buy a g5 just because of the
friends in my case I still like the g5 I
love its camera and for me the camp plus
is definitely the way to go but because
a comment down below we would love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if we want to get these news
