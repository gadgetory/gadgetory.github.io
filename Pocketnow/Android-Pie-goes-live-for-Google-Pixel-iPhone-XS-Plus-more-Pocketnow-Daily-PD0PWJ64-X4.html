should be available on some of your
phones already
to get a new apparent launch date for
the Google picks up three from some very
trusted sources will get some leaks on
the names of the iPhone lineup and
they're kind of weird
I'm Hema Rivera back in Studio One it is
Monday and I'm actually not complaining
there's a lot of cool stuff coming this
week this is PocketNow daily the
official Lucia day begin with product
announcements as honor has been really
defying the price tag lately devices
like the honor 7x it's really hard to
compete but now they've launched the
honor play which well it brings the
specifications of devices like the
Huawei P 20 Pro where we've got the Kara
970 processor in addition to lots of RAM
lots of storage but obviously there's an
LCD instead of OLED etc but the price
okay 300 bucks so they're pretty much
pointing this phone as a gaming phone
and well it's got all the potential you
can learn more the description that was
talked about Oppo as we've got some very
interesting teasers from the company on
one end we have that the company is
bringing the first Gorilla Glass 6
display on a smart phone that is all
great fine and dandy we're not exactly
sure which device it'll be we're
assuming it's the f9 that will be
announced soon though the price point on
that phone makes it kind of hard and
we've got other rumors that we hear
about 10 gigabytes of RAM on a phone and
then we're probably thinking are 17 or
whichever the case might be we'll keep
you posted now let's talk about iPhones
there are leaked images that show the
back of the iPhone 9 that we've been
dubbing for the longest time but there
are some sources that are claiming a
couple of funny things like for example
the naming scheme they're saying that
this is going to be the iPhone 10 s
meaning X s for the 10 the XS plus or
10s plus for the larger one and then the
iPhone 9 is really just going to be
called the iPhone the 2018 iPhone and
we've seen that change with products
like the iPad we're now the entry-level
iPad is just iPad so it's not that it
doesn't make sense but the XS the iPhone
XS excessive price tag right now
everyone set your calendars as we've got
sources claiming that the Google pixel 3
pixel 3 Excel will be slated sometime
around October
worth around there and even though the
sources Canadian and part of the rumors
that are conflicting are that yeah it's
going to launch in Canada on the fourth
take the date with a grain of salt as it
could just be that we're gonna get it
earlier in the United States and then a
launch in Canada Canada later or we
probably will get a joint launch
whatever the case may be we are really
looking forward to this phone and
finally the hot news today have to do
with something completely unexpected
Android Pi was just announced today
Android P is now going to be dubbed
Android Pi
aka Android 9.0 and I really wasn't
expecting it to reach my pixel to excel
after today but it is available I'm
still trying to get it to download but I
still don't get the notification you
know the way Android rollouts are they
are segments that's what it might take
my phone sometime I'll start resetting
it and everything but all the other
phones that were on the beta program are
slated to be first to receive this
update though we're not sure what dates
they will be that's all great we have a
full post on the details of Android Pi
so I'm not gonna bore you the link is in
the description but let us know in the
comments what do you think do you like
the changes that Google is bringing to
Android Pi or not because in my case I
guess what I'm most disappointed at is
that there was only 12% of phones
running Android Oreo at the time of Pi
that is I feel what Google should work
on most in my opinion and they are but
we'll see when that pushes out leave us
