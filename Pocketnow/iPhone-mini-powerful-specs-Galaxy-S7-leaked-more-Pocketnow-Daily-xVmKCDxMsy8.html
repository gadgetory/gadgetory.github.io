specifications for such a small device
LG g5 case leagues already point to the
design and what to expect and it seems
that google wants to take vr beyond just
cardboard I'm Hina ravenna and i am
going to dare you to drink a shot of
tequila / every time that i say
particularly this is parking out daily
official news today begin with google
those of you that are not fans of
putting a cardboard on your head me
included the company seems to be ready
to start the taking hardware seriously
there's this new jobs posting where the
company is looking for a specialist in
hardware that could focus on virtual
reality but bear in mind the company
actually changed that job posting to
just consumer electronics afterwards but
yeah google we already know what you
want to do stay tuned for that one when
it comes to other news we are expecting
the LG g5 to be a major revamp to the
current one we know that the buttons
will not be at the back and the other
stuff that you already know but case
makers always leak the best stuff and
today we see some ruggedized cases for
the d5 and this is rather weird as we
notice that the camera is actually
offset to the right yeah the hardware
buttons removed to the side but that
design for the camera is just horrendous
stay tuned it could be that the
Casemaker just got the renders wrong if
you're in the market for a new iPad air
i highly suggest you wait we've got some
link schematics for the ipad air 3 which
we are expecting to be announced in
march and it looks identical to the ipad
pro and yes there are significant
differences in design starting with the
speakers if you have never heard the
speakers on the ipad pro i highly
suggest you go to an apple store and do
so they sound amazing probably better
than every other computer i've tested
yes computer so yes stay tuned
apparently this will make it to the ipad
air 3 and we are waiting for it to be
announced in march another highly
anticipated device for this year is the
galaxy s7 we've seen some link renders
of the device we expect it to look a lot
like the current galaxy s6 but today we
finally see a photo of the device in the
flesh and
it could just be a galaxy s6 by the way
because it's pretty much just a device
on a test bench and apparently the
buttons are the same but the trusted
source claims that this is the galaxy s7
so don't expect much of a change I
wonder why don't they just call it the
galaxy s6 S or that would just sound
weird and finally the very hot news
today continue to be the iphone mini hey
we've already covered that it looks a
lot like the iphone 6 but everybody is
dubbing at the iphone 5s e now the most
important news here that apparently the
specifications will be just as good as
the iphone 6s apparently we are getting
the same m9 coprocessor that enables the
whole hey Siri hot word to work without
the phone being on and apparently we are
getting force touch in addition to other
parts of the specifications that we
currently see on the iphone success but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day the first of all number one do
you have a phone that has a hot word
that you know you can turn on with the
phone being off like a nexus or any
windows phone that enables hey Cortana
one and two do you actually use it
because in my case after using it for
probably just one or two days I
completely forget about it but leave us
a comment down below we look to know if
that's important to you friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video
was filmed machine for was on bugging
out comment subscribe to youtube channel
as well it also follow me on Twitter
hand under score Rivera on Instagram and
I'm every better you can also follow us
on vessel at vessel calm / pocket now
please get this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi amit ravenna
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
