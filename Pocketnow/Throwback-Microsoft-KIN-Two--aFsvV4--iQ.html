pocketnow.com it's been about a year
since Microsoft killed the kin
and of course kin was the result of the
danger acquisition danger is the company
that made the side kick and we're going
to talk about why kin failed we're gonna
take a look back at the software and see
what was interesting about it and what
really caused the demise of the device
so let's get to it
now of course there were two different
kins can one and kin - this is the kin -
this is a higher end version that has
the keyboard the higher resolution
display and it came in really really
interesting packaging one of the
problems with the kin was that it was
overpriced the data plan was as
expensive as a smartphone so most people
said why would I get sort of a
toned-down smartphone when I can just
get a full out smartphone and back a
year ago there were some really great
droids on Verizon this was a Verizon
exclusive so here we go it's supposed to
actually open up like so and there is
the kin - it's already turned on so
we're gonna talk about the device now
the thing about kin is that Microsoft
was trying to go after the very social
networking friendly Krab the people that
were constantly connected to Facebook
the people that cared a lot about text
messaging and Twitter and all of the
social networks the problem is that at
the same time smart phones could do the
same thing plus a whole lot more they
can add a lot of limitations it didn't
have a third-party app story
it was slow the hardware was limited so
people just went for full-out
smartphones okay so here's the unlock
screen and this is all by the way based
on Windows Phone 7 so of course we see a
lot of similarities and here we are and
we're going to zoom in on the device a
little bit and let's go into the the
portrait orientation now we've got a few
components here and it's not working
exactly right I think it's because they
shut down the Kin service but we've got
three home screen panels 1 2 3 we are in
the center right now which is your
social feed there should be pictures
right now this is streaming in from
Facebook and Twitter so the idea and
this is called the loop by the way is
that your loop would show you what's
going on in the social networking world
you can keep up to date if you swipe to
the left you get your favorite people
quick way to dial somebody this is a
phone after all and if you swipe to the
left this is where you go for
applications to jump into the browser
use your email client and so on and so
forth
we also have this really interesting
icon along the bottom this is called the
kins spot and this is kind of a paradigm
that made it easy to share things so
let's say you want to share your
contact information so you bring this
down here to the spot and you can put
anything in there that you want to share
and you can determine where you want it
to be shared to and then you would hit
upload and it would go to your desired
social network so kind of a cool idea
again people didn't really have the need
to have such a feature on a phone if you
want to share something in Android for
example you hit the share button and
everything is taken care of for you so
again we have the social feet here which
is quite nice now the kin two had a
slide-out keyboard pretty good slide-out
keyboard it looks a little bit funny but
it was actually very usable now in terms
of other hardware got a smallish screen
we've kind of got a pebble with like a
design a good camera on the back and a
dedicated camera key kind of awkwardly
placed towards the the Tilted part of
the Kin I always thought this was funny
look how many names there are back here
for different names sharp one Windows
Phone 2 verizon 3 and kin for so many
different brands associated with the kid
just kind of overwhelming if you never
turned a but turned over the phone and
took a look at the back so we're going
to flip back to the front here and turn
the device back on let's check out the
web browser and see how it was again
this is based on Windows Phone 7
software kind of an earlier version so
we'll jump into the browser
no flash supporter in anything like that
you can jump into landscape orientation
and we can pull down from the top here
to get our tabs you can slide these tabs
into the spot to share our website you
can flick back up to get this stuff to
go away so let's go to the desktop
version of pocket now and see what the
browsers like had a slow processor a
single core processor in the Kin which
and that with not much RAM it wasn't
intended to be really a powerful device
and here we're loading here you can see
we're on Wi-Fi and over Verizon so here
comes the desktop version of pocket now
voting on the Kin - and by the way from
multitasking you always have this button
in the bottom left corner that said
recent it brought up four tiles and from
there you could jump to another
application so here it is it's loading
on the screen you can swipe around it
hasn't finished loading yet so you know
a little bit choppy and again
sum-sum checkerboards it has multi-touch
although the screen is kind of small and
so it makes a little bit imprecise to to
zoom in with a pinch feature there so
not really a good web browser the kitten
couldn't really do web browsing that
well I'll be back here on the
application list and it says apps in the
upper left corner there we can jump into
camera and by the way kins studio was a
really cool add-on for the kin what it
let you do is manage all of your text
messages and contacts and your pictures
right from the cloud from any web
browser it even in this cool Timeline
view that lets you go back in time it's
kind of like htcsense.com
a lot of the manufacturers are doing
this now they're connecting the phone
with a web portal so right now we just
jumped back into the browser it looks
like so we're going to go back again to
the screen so we can search we can jump
into settings and everything was kind of
slow you got a splash screen and then
the settings with load and from here you
can change the themes not that much
customizability in terms of how you can
change the look and feel you just had a
variety of color schemes and you could
you'd have to restart your phone in
order to apply one of them in particular
let's go back again music and more this
would actually work with Zune it was
with the first Windows Phone to work
with Zune which of course is a pretty
cool music subscription service you paid
15 bucks a month you get unlimited music
downloads kind of like Spotify actually
and you log in with your zoo and pass
you could also download movies and that
sort of thing just like you can do now
with Windows Phone 7 so really good
multimedia integration with the Kin see
what else we have here that we can talk
about the email app was was good enough
it wasn't anything amazing we've got a
simple alarm feed reader again no
third-party apps nothing much that you
can do beyond the basics I mean it was
basically a feature phone trying to be a
smart phone or another way you could
look at it as a smart phone that was
trying to be a feature phone but they
missed the pricing they missed the
execution it was just bad timing
at a time when smart phones were
becoming very affordable and the people
that they were targeting kind of the
youthful crowd
we're aspiring to get smartphones and
they got them because they are they were
inexpensive and the data plan was the
same cost as on the Kin so some fatal
errors there that is why the Kin didn't
really make it interesting idea the bad
timing and and a not ideal execution do
you remember the Kin if so let us know
in the comments if you had a kin we want
to hear from you if you still use a kin
that would be pretty cool for you to
tell us what you think about the kin
after using it for a while they close
the kin studio so there's not much
functionality left with this device well
the word on the street is that they
didn't sell many of these at all so it's
very unlikely than anyone watching this
video actually has one if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
