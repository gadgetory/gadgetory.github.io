pocketnow.com and sure the browser that
comes on your android is really neat but
have you ever wanted to run Chrome on it
or how about Firefox not fennec Firefox
or Safari maybe even Internet Explorer
today I've got a little something
that'll actually do that or will it ok
so what we've got here to the casual
observer is an Android specifically a
Nexus One running the Android 2.1
operating system but there's something
unusual about it we've got the Chrome
browser
we've got the Mozilla Firefox browser
Safari and even Internet Explorer but
you and I both know I really don't have
all those browsers installed on my
Android phone instead what I have it is
a neat little set of apps free apps you
can get from the market called fake
Firefox fake Safari and fake Internet
Explorer and another one that's not by
the same developer but basically the
same thing a fake Chrome browser icon
now what do these do you tap them and it
opens up your default browser plain
simple not a problem but it doesn't load
the real app so you might be asking why
would you download these apps they don't
do anything
well that's true they can fake out your
friends or impress your friends you can
really trick somebody into thinking that
you have safe Safari on your Android
phone but the thing that I like about it
is it's just a little bit more like a
desktop operating system it's what I'm
familiar with or what I'm used to so
like I mentioned before it'll open up
your default web browser in this case
it's the stock Android browser that you
just saw or you can download an app
called the fake browser settings which
lets you select from your pre-installed
browser so if you had dolphin or one of
the other really nice alternate browsers
on your phone they would also be in that
list so whether or not you use it you
can see I do right there on my home
screen or not I'd like to know is this
something that you'd put on your phone
they're very small apps but
I still take up space and if you would
why are you trying to impress a friend
are you trying to fool a friend or are
you like me and you just want to be more
familiar on your phone go ahead and
comment down below and of course if
you've got a video camera and want to
post a video reply I love those so go
ahead and do that let us know in the
comments and if you thought this video
was worthwhile go ahead and give it a
thumbs up so showing off fake browser
icons I'm Joe Levi for pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
