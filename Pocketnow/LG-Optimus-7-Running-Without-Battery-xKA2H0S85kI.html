pocketnow.com
today we discovered something
interesting regarding the lg optimus 7
namely that it runs without the battery
so it sounds interesting
check out the video and we'll show you
more so what we have here we have an
Android 2.2 device which is the HTC
Desire we have a Windows Phone 6.5 which
is the HTC hd2 and we have the Windows
Phone 7 powered lg optimus 7 and we'll
show you how all of these behave while
being charged now the HTC Desire here is
currently being charged as you can tell
by the charging icon on top and the
charging cable what happens if we take
out the battery while we charge it let's
take a look let's turn the screen on see
screen is on and we take out the battery
and there you go it turned off let's try
the same things with the HTC hd2 you
just plug it in here you can see it's
charging and also the charging icon
let's pull out the battery and see what
happens
there it's instantly off but the lg
optimus 7 is something different now I
don't know if other Windows Phone 7
devices do the same so if you have a
Windows Phone 7 device and you can try
this out just let us know
plug it in like this
turn your screen on as you can see it's
currently charging and let's try to take
the battery out like this and we have
ourselves a perfectly functional phone
now this must be interesting for most of
you out there I don't know if it's a
feature if it's an error if it has
something to do with Windows Phone 7
being the one which is in charge with
battery charging but it's something neat
which I thought you should know
thanks very much for watching this
