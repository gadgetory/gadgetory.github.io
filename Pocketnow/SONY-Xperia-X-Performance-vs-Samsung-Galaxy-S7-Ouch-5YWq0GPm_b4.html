versus the current juggernaut of the
Android ecosystem Samsung this year was
on a mission to refine the galaxy line
addressing some of the concerns we had
with last year's devices Sony this year
took a more drastic move away from
high-end vanity specs but maintains a
premium price point which company has
the better strategy for separating you
from your cache it's time for a showdown
starting with design sony has produced
attractive handsets for years now and
the Xperia X features the same hard
monolith rectangular slab of design
we've come to know and love from past
Sony phones a samsung over these last
two generations has radically improved
the galaxy design this year resulting in
one of the prettiest phones of the year
Samsung has done a terrific job of
addressing some of the issues from the
s6 curving the back glass and syncing
the camera sensor now Sony actually
struggles a bit with fit and finish this
year as the side panel separates from
the phone when pulling out the SIM card
tray and these seems at the bottom
slightly Mar and otherwise clean look
I'm moving to specs samsung didn't push
the envelope too far and refining the s6
but the s7 still represents the top
mobile technology offerings available
this year both Sony and Samsung Sport
Qualcomm 820 processors but the Galaxy
rocks a terrific quad HD AMOLED screen
which is much easier to read outdoors
than Sony's 1080p LCD a bug phone Sport
32 gigabytes of storage but the sony
whittles back Ram to 3 gigabytes both
phones are ip68 water-resistant and
battery capacities differ where the
galaxy sports a 3000 milliamp hour size
and Sony scaled back to a two thousand
seven hundred milli amp power cell and
all of that Hardware powers two
different interpretations on how to
customize the Android OS TouchWiz has
been streamlined but still influences
nearly every aspect of the UI from
notification shade to homescreen app
drawer to settings menus a Sony
maintains some familiar elements like
the stock notification shade but there's
a bright playful theme applied
throughout the interface and we'll call
this one a toss-up as beauty is in the
eye of the beholder
both of these phones are plenty powerful
for covering the basics so
really testing performance here we've
got to move over to something a bit more
intense the lower resolution screen
doesn't seem to provide much benefit on
the Xperia in games like Marvel future
fight it's poorly optimized for Qualcomm
chipsets and both phones create
something of a slideshow at the highest
quality but even moving to a game like
implosion the Xperia seems to perform
about the same if maybe dropping the
framerate a bit more than what we see on
the galaxy thermal throttling might be
an issue when the phone is totally cold
and hasn't been used in a while the
Xperia benchmark well against the galaxy
s7 but after one mission in implosion
that performance is significantly
reduced the galaxy seems to handle heat
better after one mission in the same
game a radio management is a small win
for the glass packed galaxy's it managed
to hold on to Wi-Fi better throughout my
home often with around a 2 to 4 decibel
advantage over the Xperia and looking at
camera tech this is definitely an area
where Samsung walks away with a strong
victory Sony make some great sensors but
the camera app on the Xperia is a bit of
a mess and can fight the user a lot in
trying to nail down the focus and
exposure settings one might want to use
also this casing is notorious for
running the phone warm and you will
quickly see thermal warnings when using
the camera Samsung delivers the fastest
performing camera of the year terrific
autofocus a nicely laid out app with a
proper manual mode and the ability to
shoot UHD video mind you you can shoot
longer clips of UHD video from the
Samsung then you can 1080p clips from
the Xperia before both phones start
running too hot for smooth video capture
now Sony might have the higher
resolution sensor but with Ross support
Samsung also wins the battle for folks
who like to edit their photos before
sharing now the ideal fight is something
of a split decision we generally prefer
the front-facing speakers on the Xperia
but samsung's headphone jack geeks out a
win with better frequency response lower
distortion playback and a better
signal-to-noise ratio and checking out
battery life again the lower resolution
screen does little to help Sony and
packing a smaller battery into the
Xperia running our media test streaming
30 minutes of video over Wi-Fi at 190
lux the Galaxy drained 5% of its battery
while the Xperia
rained 12 these numbers were mirrored
during our real camera review where the
Samsung was able to handle shooting
samples all day while connected to LTE
while the xperia was dead by early
afternoon shooting in airplane mode
recharge speeds were a bit closer though
as our galaxy s7 tops off around 33% of
its battery after 30 minutes and the
xperia managed a 28% recharge over the
same period of time so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us between the
sony xperia x performance and the
Samsung Galaxy s7 this was a tough fight
for Sony but this experiment in walking
back some of the specs of the Xperia
just doesn't vibe well with the price
you have to pay double trouble as we've
recently covered some of the price cuts
on unlocked Galaxy s7 and with a little
savvy shopping you can match the price
of this Xperia with an s7 edge if you
want the bigger battery and here in the
United States the Xperia will receive
won't even come with a fingerprint
sensor omitting a great little
convenience feature often will refrain
from declaring an outright winner in
these comparisons as buying a smart
phone is a very personal investment but
Sony is asking a lot of us to remain
fans of this brand
I don't like casually bandying about
phrases like bloodbath and maybe I
wouldn't use it here but this experience
scores precious few wins against a phone
which I genuinely enjoy using from
Samsung as always thanks so much for
