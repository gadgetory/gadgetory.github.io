now calm I've got the Lumia 920 from
Nokia over here and the Windows Phone 8x
from HTC over here we're going to take a
look at the differences between these
devices both are available on AT&amp;amp;T right
now and let's check out okay first up
we're gonna look at the specs on the
Lumia 920 and the Windows Phone 8x so
I've got them both loaded here and you
can see there's quite a difference in
the sizes right there this one's much
thinner you see the thickness there you
also see the weight difference 130 grams
versus 185 scroll down a little more we
have the processor difference both are
about 1.5 gigahertz dual-core but we
have a slightly different processor type
over here we have one gig of ram same
for it here we have 16 gigs of storage
32 well 29 gigs of storage over here and
here's our screen type is a color IPS
TFT and over here we have a Super LCD -
and you see this size differences four
and a half inches 4.3 the resolution
differences 720 by 1280 over here 768 by
1280 over here so this is a little bit
wider and this is a skinnier one over
there now let's scroll some more you see
our radio support and everything else
that you would expect bluetooth Wi-Fi
all that's there both of these are
available at 18 t so we're gonna just
look at those prices you see this one is
199 with a two-year contract and this
one it's only 99 with a two-year
contract and you can see the color
options available here and for some
reason we don't see color options on
that one
okay next let's look at benchmarks let's
see how fast this processor goes both
are 1.5 gigahertz so dual-core that
should be pretty close and you see the
tests are going pretty quickly
however already you see the processor
was a little bit faster on the Lumia 920
but the data was a little bit faster on
the Windows Phone 8x now we're doing the
GPU tests and we should be done any
second see this one's in 24 frames per
second same over there and here we are
so you see a slightly higher score on
the Lumia 920 okay now let's look at the
displays because we have a different
display technology in both these see if
we can see any difference both are
looking pretty good I think the blacks
are blacker over here let's look at the
black test very close a little bit
blacker here and we also we also have
lighting an issue
and let's try the weights
the white here I'm thinking might be a
little warm or is this white it's a
little cool but they're pretty close
color ramp see any banding not really
pretty good gradients looking good here
too
now let's do the display angle
pretty good keeping the color consistent
there so both displays are running very
nicely now let's talk about the camera a
little bit optical image stabilization
over here so that means you can do
better low-light pictures because it
kind of keeps the lens day and let's
just look at a picture there's one I
just took this is the same scene very
dark and you can see what the 8x did I
mean you can barely even see the edge of
the mug that's the edge of the mug right
there a very small highlight and you can
see what the Lumia 920 did both are
pretty dark but obviously we got a
better quality image over here at least
for that purpose now let's look at what
kind of software customizations HTC has
given us and Nokia has given us so all
of the brand apps are going to be
available in these different stores some
are going to be bundled with the device
but some are going to be free downloads
so HTC has the HTC hub connection setup
flashlight photo enhancer and converter
there's also a few little customizations
here there's the HTC others Beats Audio
amplifier so you get really good music
over here you also have the attentive
phone feature where you can flip it over
to silence or ring that kind of thing
but over here on on the Nokia collection
we have a lot of custom apps from Nokia
some are actually other brands like
Groupon and The Weather Channel but
they're customized a little bit and
exclusive to Nokia for a little while so
you see we have all sorts of stuff here
we have the Nokia Drive GPS navigation
program which works good with Windows
Phone 8 we have Nokia Maps note' transit
for doing subway train instructions bus
schedules we have a special ESPN app
we have some nice camera lenses of photo
editing program city lens nokia music
for free music downloads panoramic and
we don't really have much over there on
the HTC side the only really cool one is
the big clock live tile which gives you
weather as well okay next let's look at
the browsing
the Lumia seems a little bit smoother on
the panning you zoom in on one of these
that was pretty quick and he can tell
that the screen is more sensitive on the
Lumia 920
oh that's pretty much the same both of
these are on Wi-Fi because this is an
international version doesn't have LTE
now I'm going to bring a glove in here
okay so I have a glove over my finger
the leather part doesn't oh well
sometimes it does I guess so that can
control the screen I can tap that but
over here I got nothing okay lastly
let's just take it I showed you the
specs but we'll take a good look around
these devices there's the back that's
how those look you can see the thickness
difference that's a quick look at the
Nokia Lumia 920 and the Windows Phone 8x
from HTC I'm sure to give this video a
thumbs up and let us know which you like
better in the comments
