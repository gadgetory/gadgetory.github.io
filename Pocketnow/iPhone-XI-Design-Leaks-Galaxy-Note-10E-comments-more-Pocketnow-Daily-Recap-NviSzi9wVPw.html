be requited on a plane actually try to
do that with the 1 plus 6 camera
experience and people started looking at
me funny Apple news plus for $9.99 a
month why should you pay for news you
get it from how you leave it up for free
exactly your hair is getting grayer it's
actually the other way around that's
right it's that time of the week I'm
high metal you laid out this is
PocketNow and this is the bargain out
daily recap your comments for last week
so Monday the topic was the iPhone 11 of
the rumors that it's gonna get reverse
wireless charging a bigger battery and
it'll finally launch with a bigger I
mean the faster charger in the box I
asked you if these are elements that you
need to consider this phone we have 382
comments same same design Apple can only
upgrade battery I think you said it best
I like reverse wireless charging for
charging accessories and not other
phones you technically can and can't
charge other phones I mean you can but
it didn't really charge him fast
I thought Apple had dropped the
reversible wireless charging where've
you been man then on Tuesday the topic
was the Galaxy Note end there are rumors
there are up to four variants out of
which two of them one of them with 5gn
without will be smaller phones I asked
you what do you like about that idea we
had 482 comments yes bring a note
variant with a flat display oh my god
that would be so cool a flat display on
a note cuz honestly you know perv the
spies are cool I just I'm not really a
fan I know 10 the size of the note 9 but
with a completely flat screen and no
bezels would be ideal Wow okay two
people want a flat display three with me
alright we're winning here a smaller no
10 will definitely sell a scaled-down no
10 with a few cutbacks but a lower price
tag will be a winner
I don't agree with that I feel that they
should just do the smaller led they
should just launch like the experience
that we have with the s10 II where you
don't really have compromise with that
phone other than the telephoto but it's
a flat display they add the S Pen and
you know the same flagship speakers
sorry specifications I think we'd be
fine then on Wednesday the topic was the
1 plus 7 we had leaked renders I mean
we've seen League renders for this phone
for like
forever I mean it's no longer a secret
what to expect I asked you what did you
think about the design we had 404
comments the extra cutout on the bottom
of the oneplus is for dual headphone
jacks to make up for the last generation
um next comment coming from a 1 + 6 user
I'm liking the new design of the 1 + 7
just give me better oled screen and
better speakers and I'm good to go and a
headphone jack cut out is for the flux
capacitor finally once again next
comment then on Thursday you know the
leaks of the iPhone 11 with that
horrendous camera hump at the back we
had some leaks of that backplate I asked
you what did you think about this
possible design we had 509 comments the
iPhone Elevens back camera went from a
bum to an actual act normal growth my
god you're a doctor aren't you yeah but
I've got it's just I'm hoping that it's
not that ugly
now iPhones include an Apple watch in
the back glass this is genius 10 Apple
oh my god alright you guys are on a roll
but oh god probably if you're going for
the large bearing can you imagine the
size of that hump it will be called the
iPhone 11 stove I could just imagine
like the cases that you'll have like you
remember that commando case they came up
with for the make 20 pro something like
that and then finally on Friday the
topic was the galaxy s 10 5g the fact
that we had pre-ordered eight so still
no price tag and I asked you like are
you excited for this we had 385 comments
man I can't wait for 5g use it my entire
243 minutes before running out of data
okay yeah that's one of my biggest
questions like exactly how our carrier
is going to handle that part because
obviously right now they sell you
gigabytes and the whole idea with 5 G's
that you can get tons of gigabytes
streamed in seconds I don't think that
many people care about 5g to be honest a
good LTE connection is simple enough I
don't think there's such a thing as a
good LTE connection to the United States
man go to Europe go to even certain
Latin American countries like on dudas
your LT connections there are
significantly better
here I don't think 5g is worth them now
I'll wait a year or more than that
affordable 5g phone I think that's gonna
take a while but we'll see that's it for
the parking a daily recap thank you so
