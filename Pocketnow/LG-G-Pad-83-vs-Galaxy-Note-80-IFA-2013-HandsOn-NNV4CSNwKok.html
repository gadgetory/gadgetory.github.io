Nexus 7 but it also is playing in the
same category as another 8 inch tablet
device the Galaxy Note 8.0 we're gonna
take a quick look at how these compare
here at Aoife in 2013 in Berlin I'm
Michael Fisher with pocket now let's get
to it
so side by side the differences in the
aesthetic design become apparent LG is
opted for an aluminum back panel here
and contrast with Samsung's traditional
build quality of hyper glaze 2
polycarbonate you can also notice right
up front here that the speakers these
are stereo speakers left and right on
the back unfortunately our back mounted
not side mounted like on Samsung's
device which one you prefer will depend
on how you use the tablet more we were
able to cover up these speakers with our
thumbs in both our full review and the
after the buzz a little more often than
we would have liked so maybe you will
prefer this arrangement both have 5
megapixel primary camera surround the
back as well and as far as thickness
goes we're not looking at a major Gulf
they're aged LG's new tablet as 8.3
millimeters the real difference of
course being and actually mentioned by
the way IR blaster their IR blaster up
top or transmitter if you prefer a real
difference being measurement wise in
bezel size these are I believe seven
point nine millimeters on the new LG
tablet samsung's bezel size is
significantly larger thanks to the
requirement to include the s-pen which
of course we've looked at quite a bit
everyone knows how that works and what
kind of value of that adds LG did not
include a stylus on this device you can
use a capacitive stylus with it of
course but there are some aspects of the
software that emulate or reproduce some
of the note aids features and take a
look at those in a second but just so we
get a feel for the displays here
this is a 1920 by 1200 display over here
8.3 inches full HD IPS the Galaxy Note I
believe is 1280 by 800 obviously a big
pixel density improvement on the LG
product let's take a look in software
and see what we can learn in terms of
software here it's a little difficult to
show the differences in the lock screen
because LG's unit here is locked into
some kind of a retail demo mode but the
the new to G pad 8.3 does have na komm
which allows you to double tap on the
screen both to lock in to unlock the
tablet which we find pretty nice Samsung
replicating that functionality with a
physical home button down below which LG
does not incorporate you can see the
software keys down here back home and
menu a couple other hidden features in
there as well but the lock buttons off
to the side on each one we can lock and
unlock traditionally if you prefer as we
were saying before the S Pen adds a
whole lot of functionality to the note 8
that we've talked rather extensively
about that LG has not been skimping on
the added features here as you can see
in the notification tray here we've got
very similar controls the first
brightness goes and some of those
toggles there's an entire tray of qslide
apps which you can run seulji's
multitasking approach you can run these
apps side by side you can run them in
Windows you have various options for
changing their transparency and so on
one of the areas that excites us the
most of the difference in multitasking
approach the Samsung you can pull up the
the application ribbon there of course
as you can at any Android device and you
can also I'm not going to do that one
you can also throw applications to
applications side by side with each
other
you're gonna switch them invert them and
so on that's really a lot of fun LG in
addition to providing the the standard
multitasking ribbon just like on the
Samsung device or any Android device it
has a slider side so we can open Chrome
there we go there's Chrome we wait if
you rather than just closing it we use
three fingers to swipe it off to the
side a little bit of a cumbersome
gesture but once you get the hang of it
and assuming your three fingers handy
you throw all these over there and then
when you want to pull the ribbon back
and just three fingers swipe over there
you have your apps you can tap right
into them to jump into them or if you
prefer hop back in here you can toss
them out the top of the screen as Anton
just noted in his hands-on with this
device it's a lot like webOS of course
LG now owns the rights to much of webOS
so that shouldn't be a surprise it is
interesting a lot of other features here
and of course we've got LG is Q memo
which though there's no S Pen here does
allow it to use your fingertip does
provide quite a few options for what
kind of you know marker you want to use
I want to say servo this and so yeah we
want to do a hangout and we definitely
want to do it on Google we also sort of
want to do a voice search later on I
don't know who would do that but if you
wanted to do that you could do it a lot
of other functionality here of course as
well this is just a very very quick look
the software differences here between
TouchWiz on Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 and
LG's custom UI I will say this
LG no stranger to making responsive user
interface this is kind of a similar but
you can notice this little springy
action we get at the end of the home
screen here yeah icons just come up and
they bounce back yeah it's a little
cartoony it's a little
but it is responsive it's the kind of
responsiveness we first saw on the what
was it the Optimus G really blew us away
and that appears from the case here just
not even though this device has been
abused it's also running a special
retail mode really really white I mean
really tough to get this to bog down
it's pretty impressive Galaxy Note 8 no
slouch of course but Samsung you know
not quite as up to the task in terms of
raw responsiveness of the UI but like we
say very quick look we're gonna have a
proper comparison of these two devices
in the weeks ahead once we get a review
unit our hands till now we've got till
then rather a lot more to do at Eva here
in Berlin I'm Michael Mitchell at
PocketNow that's Tony behind the camera
stay tuned for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
