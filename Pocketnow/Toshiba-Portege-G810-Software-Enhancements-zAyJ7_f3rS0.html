pocketnow.com and this is a video of
getting started with the toshiba g 810
I'm gonna turn it on for the first time
now I've just installed the battery it
looks like the power button is off to
the side here so I'm gonna hold it in
and okay there we go
I haven't put my sim card in just yet so
it'll tell me that I won't have any
signal windows mobile 6.1 they're very
nice let me zoom in a little bit more
and of course tap the screen to set up
your device let's find the stylus the
stylus where could the stylus be hmm
is it okay cuz that's it I cannot find
the stylus okay I found the stylus what
you have to do is actually slide your
finger along the side look at this thing
and try to get into focus here this is
the stylus it's very unconventional I'm
not sure if I like it anywho that's good
it could start with this
okay I'm gonna skip that of course
change the time later
says the SIM card is missing I know that
I look at these buttons glow blue very
interesting okay so no evidence okay
here's something select an application
to install Toshiba virtual keyboard and
it gives you a description Toshiba
virtual keyboard is a unique text input
tool it covers the entire screen it has
enough large it has enough keys large
enough to be tacked with the fingertips
I'm just gonna put all of these in see
what happens and click Next this can use
up memory okay that's fine okay guys so
after about two minutes I have something
to show here we have SP be mobile shell
that looks like which is a program that
s PB sells for I think 25 or $30 and it
gets very high reviews because what it
allows you to do is access all of your
information from an on windows mobile
looking interface here which is pretty
nice so here we have a clock in the
center and if I click on the clock I get
well the time and times in other cities
should I choose that if I click the back
button I can go to weather and then
we're back into the kind of standard
Windows Mobile look and I can choose a
city but I'm gonna do cancel because I
don't have a data connection just the
second we have links to messaging here
so if I click on that it'll bring me to
the standard text messaging application
and of course this is windows mobile 6.1
so we have threaded text messages which
is really great I'm assuming clicking on
this brings us to missed calls and of
course I just turned on this phone so
there are no missed calls this is a
profile switcher Windows Mobile
professional still doesn't have profiles
but they added a way to switch between
silent vibrate and normal in mobile
shell now on the bottom this lets you
toggle through the various views that
you'll see on the screen so the first
view is lit up it's the calendar and if
I click on the 9th of July they're
actually we're in January right now if
it'll bring open the Windows Mobile
calendar if we go to the bottom to the
second one we get an application
launcher and the internet is standard
wow that was interesting
I like that animation Wow wow did you
see that it's kind of got some cube it's
like a cube that rolls forward
I like that I'm so you go to Internet
Explorer and like I said I don't have a
data connection so I'm gonna get out of
that and notice how each time I exit a
program I am taken back to this SPD
mobile shell display not sure if I like
that I have to get used to where
everything is placed in the screen
before I can use it all the time what
else is up here we have this one which
takes us the screen brightness is that
yeahit's screen brightness so I can make
it real dim or real bright it's quite
convenient this looks like Wi-Fi
connectivity this will rotate the device
landscape I'll keep it in that for now
and back so let's go back to landscape
we have a lock button which I'm assuming
is the device lock and well that's
annoying I don't want to lock my device
and if you notice when I turned it to
landscape and actually reoriented the
the buttons on them that we're on the
bottom now they're on the right so let's
continue up to this icon for phone this
allows you to dial favorite people and
I'm assuming it'll allow you to
associate a picture with each person's
name and finally this X actually gets
you out of SBB mobile shell and into the
standard today screen ok now quickly I
want to take a look if there's any
programs in the Start menu that aren't
typically installed on a windows mobile
device so we have Auto config here this
is probably yeah you can set it up based
on your carrier in the US so I'm going
to choose AT&amp;amp;T Wireless because that's
who my carrier is and it'll set up all
the connections with GPRS and whatnot to
make sure your device works I don't want
to do it now I'll click cancel okay a
GPS this has assisted GPS to get a
quicker fix which is good
auto install not sure what that is not
going to tap on that black list looks
like you can block people from calling
you ok FM radio please connect a headset
of course this device uses the headset
that you connect with earphones as the
antenna to get a signal we have full
screen keyboard here by SPB that's
another enhancement and you're supposed
to be able to use your thumbs to type on
this I've never actually used this let
me try the
the quick that didn't really work very
well okay so I need some practice on
that how do I get out of here doot doot
okay that did it good we've getting
started which is the windows mobile 6.1
kind of cheat sheet on how to set up
various aspects of your phone such as
making a call and the flick scrolling
doesn't seem to work in there that's
strange let me go back yeah it doesn't
that's odd okay we have image to text
which is a neat application that lets
you take a picture of a business card
and store it as text it actually uses
OCR to do that pretty cool we've image
editor that's new
okay I'm gonna click on an image I'm
assuming it'll allow me to paint on this
let's see
draw here it is and I choose a color red
and it's not drawing I need to look into
that some more and figure that out so
that is the image editor internet
sharing built in of course task manager
that's in windows mobile 6.1 it shows
you the memory usage of all the programs
open and how much of the CPU your they
are using streaming player wonder what
that is
probably a streaming internet player I
must say that the performance of this
device is pretty good let me open up the
settings menu for the first time it's
pretty fast it's almost as fast as the
I'm 890 502 which doesn't surprise me
because it uses the same processor let's
see how we're doing in terms of memory
get a little closer there so program
memory we're using about half of what we
have available and that makes sense we
have a lot of programs open
I think this integration of SPB software
on a new device from Toshiba is quite
interesting and I'm gonna have a lot
more to say about this device I also
want to play with these buttons down
here to see exactly how they operate
they are indeed touch sensitive by the
way so more on this soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
