quote we've been using to kick-start
wireless charging videos for about three
years now but on today's video you get a
twofer I'm Michael Fisher with pocket
now and we're taking a look at the view
solo wireless charger and the view mate
add-on for the galaxy note for both of
them from tilt if you've been watching
for a while you're familiar with tilt we
took a look at the company's earlier
view wireless charger back in 2012 a
great product that I still use today
we'll be taking a look at the view solo
first if you want to skip ahead to the
galaxy note 4 portion of the video
there's a time code in the description
below the new view comes packaged in
very attractive retail garb which makes
clear that it's not as bendy or as bold
as its predecessor but it also calls out
its prime distinction the alignment
ledge that makes it easier to use than
other lay flat charging pads in theory
taking the view solo out of its box the
back cover reminds us that a charging
adapter may be necessary depending on
our phone that's a detail that's also
called out in the paperwork that comes
bundled underneath the power cord is
micro USB and flattened in that
fettuccine linguini style I love so much
and there's the alignment ledge we'll
see more of in a second the view solo
itself is a small lightweight
transmitter with a soft rubbery landing
pad done up in red here it also comes in
green blue and even slate gray if you're
the more subdued sort stripping the
protective film off the thing I'm struck
by how light the view solo is a good
thing since it's built to be portable to
prevent it from sliding around on a desk
tilt has built in some microgel suction
pads on the base that's nice but it
implies a permanence that I don't like
reminiscent of the old palm touch tones
I move around a lot and I like my
chargers especially my portable ones to
be able to move with me tilt says you
can reposition the padded will but I'm
not rolling the dice on that today so
we'll keep those covered for now
plugging the cable into the pad I'm sad
to discover there's no wall adapter in
the box again though this is made to be
a road companion so plugging it into
your computer's USB port is fine also
most smartphone wall works will work
just make sure the output is rated for
at least 5 volts and 1.8 amps wireless
charging won't work as well without that
added oomph once you're energized it's a
simple matter of dropping a chi enabled
phone on the pad and watching the
electrons flow the alignment ledge
slides when given enough of a push so
you can adjust the sweet spot with a
little elbow grease and the little
charging indicator fires up when
replenishment is underway but what if
you don't have a chi enabled phone
that's where our galaxy note 4 demo
device comes in the note 4 doesn't have
the hardware necessary for Qi charging
so we're going to install it in the form
of the view mate this is sold separately
by tilt and it comes packaged with a few
pieces of literature and a small
envelope the made itself is small and
thin because it has to be it needs to
fit under the battery cover of the note
4 without causing a bulge more on this
in a second like most tilt instructions
these are straightforward and they
basically amount to this pull off the
back cover locate the charging ports
above and beside the battery peel off
the adhesive backing on both sections of
the card and carefully stick it to the
phone emphasis on carefully then replace
the cover as you do you'll notice it's
harder to close the cover on one side of
the phone that's because it does cause a
bulge it is a minor one you can only see
it from certain angles but the baby bump
is definitely there if you can't see it
well the tabletop can feel it if you
have a phone case with tight tolerances
it definitely won't like this very much
at all so does it work yeah sorta at
first putting the note floor directly
onto the plate doesn't elicit a response
which is probably why tilt included a
card with tips on positioning trying
different orientations I quickly find
that I'm lucky or with the green light
if I place the note sideways on the pad
which sort of ruins the whole alignment
ledge thing and even when I had a green
light at first I wasn't actually
charging I had to go back in and reseat
the pins pressing hard and making sure
everything lined up perfectly and even
then I got no charging love from the
view solo at first only by tossing the
note 4 on the old tilt view that I get a
firm zap of juice and then finally it
worked on the solo the view mate did
throw our NFC reception for a loop it
didn't completely disable it as the
package warned it might but it did
possibly affect its reception and speed
as it took me several tries to get a
reading on this digital tattoo and I had
no luck at all getting a response from
other NFC tags so at the end of the day
would I recommend these devices well I
have to say no to the view mate it's
clever and it's pretty and at 24 99 it's
pretty cheap but it makes the phone
bulge the fit is finicky NFC is hit and
miss and it makes you charged off center
cosmetically it's a very pretty attempt
at bringing Chi to a non sheet of ice
but in all I think it's a better
argument for integrated wireless
charging than adding it on after the
fact what about the view mate well the
so-called alignment system though clever
is less revolutionary upgrade than
plastic tab also it doesn't have the
heft or presence of earlier tilt
products and it doesn't come with a wall
wart and for twenty bucks more you can
get a self-contained wireless charging
plate with its own battery or a
bluetooth-enabled charger with
notification light from microsoft on the
other hand though it's the right size
for travel it seems to work well with
native cheese smartphones and it's got
much more pizazz than some other
wireless chargers I've seen so yeah I
like it just fine if you can't afford
the big tilt view either in terms of its
footprint or its price tag but you still
want some edge with your electrons
the view solo is a good solution for
wireless charging when you're on the
road for more coverage of wireless
charging accessories check out our other
videos both here in youtube and at
pocketnow.com and don't be afraid to
press that thumbs up button if you did
enjoy this video until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain two phones on twitter reminding
you to keep your alignment tab in the
upright and locked position thanks for
watching everyone we'll see you next
