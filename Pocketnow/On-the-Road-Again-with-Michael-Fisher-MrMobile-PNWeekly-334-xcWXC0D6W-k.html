this week I am indeed driving around
looking for the best grub from roadside
restaurants though this time around I
have a best bud with me hello everybody
and welcome to episode 334 of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers recorded over two days
from Wednesday the 28th of November 2018
now I'm somewhere in California and
actually in each and every part of this
podcast I'm in a different place in
California as I Drive up the coast with
the best bud you know him as either
Michael Fisher or of course the mister
mobile we're driving up the coast in a
Hyundai Nexo and Michael was gracious
enough to invite me to be his co-pilot
on this particular test drive where
we're driving a hydrogen powered car up
the California coast
we've gone from San Diego to Santa
Barbara up to San Francisco and now
we're actually in wine country in Napa
Valley and we're gonna go a little bit
further before this week is over but
while we were on this trip we were
having so many discussions on the road
as you do during a road trip we've had a
lot of fun gotten to know each other
even better in our friendship and we had
a lot of discussions that I realized we
should be having on the pocket now
weekly and this one in particular is a
reminiscence of 2018 not only going
through some of the best devices that we
have had the pleasure of testing this
year as Michael has done his awards
video over on his channel which we do
talk about in the first half of this
podcast but we also look back at maybe
some of the other pieces of news that
came out some of the trends that we are
looking forward to in 2019 that may or
may not have started in 2018
rolling oh man I cannot believe I can't
believe we're doing it this way no Sam
is easier you can just sit there I
should be a pilot what I own I would
imagine that the boyband Mike says we've
called him on the show are gonna help Oh
most definitely I already feel like I'm
driving a 747 can you give a quick
explanation as to why we're even in this
configuration well yeah because either
the steering wheels over here so that's
not what I meant
we are in a car yes it's a very special
car isn't it yes it is we're in a
Hyundai and obviously mr. Boies here
with us right now we're doing a special
podcast for this week on ice one hour
just discussion inside of the on date
mixer which you're gonna hear a lot more
of probably later this year definitely
22-18 obviously it is a hydrogen powered
vehicle and we have been testing this
out
Thank You stonde sorry I don't know why
I did that we there is a lot to like
about where we are right now yeah aside
from the traffic which we've taken
advantage of and that's the reason why
we've set up these cameras we are
recording your podcast here so this is
the pocket my weekly episode number 334
if I remember correctly but if it's not
right you'll probably tours the correct
number at the edge
well yeah I mean we've spent the last
few days together or spending a couple
more and we're gonna be together next
week in a whole different estimation oh
that's right we have a lot of time
together obviously you know of the as
people say bromance between myself and
mr. Moyer big time bromance brother ears
I'm very very glad that you're my
co-pilot for this one also thank you for
agreeing to do the podcast
in this manner no I was just thinking
man like we're looking at the Android
auto eta right now we're driving from
San Francisco to Sacramento at the
moment we've got one hour 54 minutes
left and I can't think of a better way
to burn time in traffic than podcasting
because we've been talking this whole
way anyway ever since San Diego so why
not record something we really have like
we've gotten to know each other very
well on this but as far as tech related
not really news is concerned because
obviously I can I don't have a laptop in
front of me Jules isn't in the booth
yeah have somebody prompting me for the
for the news items I kind of want to
just take this hour to look back on 2018
get a little bit contemplative because
mr. mobile here actually just released
his video about the awards that he gave
out for and this year's devices and I
wanted to go through the Mentalist a
little bit just sort of maybe gush but
also reminisce about the year that has
been especially the last few wants my
goodness oh yeah good god I love to the
spread of awards you had Sochi that the
first one was the captain two phone's
award right thank you yeah I don't
remember what order we put him in but
the captain two phones award most
definitely because I knew I wanted to
issue an award to like here's the thing
with the words right it's always best
stuff it's always best of it's always
the best the top the the winner the the
loser the you know it's like I wanted to
do one that was the weirdo award like
here's the phone that I really frankly
have never recommended to normal people
but it's a phone that's so charming or
weird or otherwise niche that it demands
that okay I'm gonna carry this so I'm
gonna have to carry a second phone to
make up for its shortcomings
yeah and that phone was like BAM and
that's that's so cool because as many of
you know the two of us
car right now are generally advocates
for that keyboard yet were the last two
right yeah we are as attention to tech
bloggers world we indeed yeah I'll never
always remember that one picture we took
a Google i/o low a while back and we
were all holding at the time it was keep
one yeah we were also happy with it and
it was like yeah what you see in this
photo is literally the amount of people
Pope's would just use this fun we're
selling like blackberry fans short of
course there were people who buy the key
to and it's it's great for a lot of
folks but for people like us who rely on
cameras in particular you know you need
a second phone and for the various other
things like a big screen if you wanna
you know I don't watch netflix on my key
to folks started at this point I have
I've done extensive YouTube dealing on
there have you really I have some
YouTube you it takes a little while to
get used to I will admit yeah and you
have that entire keyboard on the side
that sometimes you wish you could use
for certain functions like skipping
forward a few seconds or use the
scrolling app for us the scrolling
ability in order to do the the seeking
inside of the video yes obviously not
the case but that's fine like I look
past it I think oh you need and you know
what's wrong but if the key to how I've
always viewed myself as a very tolerant
tech person in the sense that because
like I know people who would look at the
key to they would see that keyboard on
the side the fact that the screen is not
even sixteen by nine it's definitely far
from 18 minus 3x2 it has 3 by 2 and they
would just they would just lose their
minds over it so upset there were two
beats just so much vitriol in their
voices when they talk about the
experience I'm not that way
like it doesn't take much for me to
adapt
and you know what's crazy is like you
will get feedback from all sides of the
things of the of the question in the
comments right it's like it seems like
every every time that I get really
enthusiastic about a device there's
always a segment of folks who are just
like you're being paid to say that or
you're you're just you you just like
everything or whatever and then when I
really Slama divisors you're too hard on
this you're too narrow so it's
impossible to please everybody right now
just gotta exist in our own way and
that's why when I was due to putting
these awards together I was like you
know I don't have the review lab that
that some folks do I don't really deal
with the generative review scores I
can't do spreadsheets of averages I'm
just going to sit and think about this
and select winners based on a cocktail
of considerations including how much
they've affected the market how how well
they achieved their various objectives
but also mostly how much they've
affected me yeah for better or worse
what's at the end of the day is well
yeah for me yeah yeah and it's been the
thing I'm about to say next is not to
say that you have to create an award for
the key to but I love that you had that
angle and it fit right in yeah and it
made so much sense like personally for
me and I feel like a lot of people if I
had to choose a captain to wielder what
would you do you know what you've been
awarded to what coordinates of the picks
launch because next ring yeah hey I'm
very much use the pixel table of the
daily to begin with it's not the fish to
be but it is yes pretty particularly in
still mode I think it over to video yeah
it might be a much closer contest
between note 9 and pixels pixels at
nighttime when I shouldn't low light a
lot in video and the noise really is is
still an issue
I actually would probably have the pig
song alongside some sort of
something like any of the new phones
coming out that have like mechanical
parts that slide or motors like the Opel
5x just because it's fun fun then the
pixel fills in all the gaps that that
the first one doesn't have like the
camera inside it if you like that would
be Lakers right and I think a lot of
people over here at pocket Malibu feel
the same way that the camera is just so
reliable that it makes the experience
like I said in my review if you haven't
seen that yet it's a Broadway channel of
course I made just in his review as well
so you can see right now well yeah I
called it the most disappointing phone I
still use every single day wow that's
nice yeah and then perfectly
encapsulated encapsulates it again did
you have the the excel yes yes yeah I
think if I if I use the Excel I would be
in the exact same boat because I've
tested the smaller one though every time
I pick up my pixel three I don't
immediately want to throw it into the
sea I'm sorry the other exhales period
well I remember I remember you and you
and I were choosing our devices and
you're kind of adamant to whoever we
were talking to thank you yep and I
wanted the large one I wanted to see
what that Lord
would be able to do that fun I'm happy
to report that it is generally a fun to
the finest read even with that action
like am i hiding use nacho nacho nacho
now and you also don't have the penalty
I pay the price for the smaller phone
because the battery doesn't last long at
all from the small zexal
just like it never has the smaller pixel
has never done one but even then the XL
I would not I would definitely not call
it isn't that crazy
you're not running any crazy extra
software on it you're running Google's
the pixel and take on Android you in its
doing this crazy of RAM management thing
where he's closing apps on the
background much more often than I think
it should and yet these things are not
battery performers it's very very
strange yeah
I if I remember correctly the pixel
didn't really
make a newborn's didn't didn't now as
good as the pixel is and as much as I
genuine they do use it all the time
it's it's this struck me as a year that
Google really didn't excel in any
particular respect outside of the camera
which is particularly which is already
what we were expecting yeah so it just
seemed it just didn't really honestly I
didn't consider it for long at all I
sort of knew all along but now this
isn't really a year where the pixel is
shining so no indeed yeah look back the
pixel to excel was far superior in audio
quality
oh you mentioned that in microphone I
just remember times David Emmel shouts
out to David he once did a full
voiceover just using the pixel 2x I did
it using a voice recorder nice I don't
know if it would be I don't see why it
would be different once you hit the
record button in the camera I imagine it
would it be different so I would say
probably the mics long to our we've done
that once on the three so I don't know
sure is really odd but that is that is
probably the most disappointing part is
that the audio just I'm so bad
so I agree with you it probably would
not it would get the dual wielder award
in my case but I don't think it would
actually fit any of the other categories
like what was that you had right what
was the one that you did okay so just
kind of waving my hand up here you can
see that rings are now a thing and I'm
trying to remember what was the award
that you that you gave this particular
ring you are wearing they said this was
one of three awards that was classified
under the stay mobile over the stand and
basically I just picked that name
because that's the catch phrase and but
this was category focused on non phones
okay so that's why it was one of the
state mobile Wars it's just the best of
the non phone stuff that I thought stood
out this year for me it was the motive
smart ring which I am wearing right now
as well yes I'm wearing its competitor
the aura and we were throwing around a
few different terms because we were kind
of comparing our rings over dinner the
other night and it's like this is the
ring for fitness trackers and my ring
Deora is the ring for the biohacker and
he likes cuffed openly guffawed into my
stick hackers I mean I have to say that
the motive does to a lot of things
really well it definitely takes the
fitness tracker and puts it into a four
factor that makes perfect sense and it's
something that you would quite literally
wear all the time because it's that
unintrusive yes on the other hand it's
also good looking to it is pretty good
you should have seen the original horror
yeah we had a big old lump oh yeah it
was huge little thing yeah it was really
weird that's what I want version 2 came
out it jumped right on it because I
figured out how to streamline their
design but the motive in particular link
so step tracking sleep tracking hard
tracking
yes and you mentioned that it has
I need the mini an explanation as to how
this ring does them does the two-factor
so do I used it now I have but it's like
I looked at the technical stuff and I
was trying to write it up and that's
when the middle of tech Tober happened
and I just like the review went right to
the back of the show I knew what my
conclusion was gonna be but I didn't I
don't actually have the video put
together yet so what effectively if
you're familiar with a UV key or
Google's tightened security key sure
this serves the same purpose where if
you're not familiar with that basically
you input your password and then where
you would normally get a two-factor
authentication prompt being like hey let
us text you your one time code don't use
SMS for that and if you don't know what
I'm talking about with two-factor
authentication at all
two-factor authentication on everything
please immediately security oh man but
instead of using that texted getting a
text of code sent to you or emailed to
you or through an authentication app you
can just have a physical key and that
motive ring can now serve as that
physical key and you you tell the
computer use my physical key and then
you do this little little hand move that
I can't really illustrate with words too
well except to say like you know when
somebody is asking you for a thumbs-up
or thumbs-down and you're like it's kind
of mediocre that's basically what you do
and you just do it in open space the
accelerometer tells the ring that that's
what it's doing and it authenticates
through bluetooth yeah to your computer
whatever you're trying to log into
Chrome or but it has to be able to tooth
connect it to that device see that's
correct
so does a Yubikey or a Titan C key the
very first thing you do when you're
authenticating it is putting in their
pairing mode it informs the Bluetooth
connection you do at one time pen
and it's it's sound here's the problem
it sounds really complicated it's at if
I was listening to this I would be like
I don't ever want to buy that that
sounds ways yeah
but once you've once you get used to it
it's great because no one who doesn't
have that physical key can get into your
stuff
yeah and security should be the easiest
thing to market to people but it's hard
to the slight hard and you know
do you remember what BlackBerry said
when we were pressing him for questions
on the key - yeah and they were like
yeah well here's the problem of security
if security is working right you never
hear about it yes yes Rob it's true and
it's impossible to sell that yeah just
to give a little bit of extra
information as to the ring that I'm
wearing it's it is a fitness tracker but
it's its main claim to fame is using
that information to sort of coach you in
the main metric that it does that they
would have does not which the reason why
I picked it is that it it actually it
tracks your heart rate variability now
I'm not gonna get into the Nitty Gritty
of it but it's not just that it tracks
your heart rate it also tracks the
amount of time between the beats of your
horns and when it's varied and it's it's
different with every beat that actually
means you're more relaxed and actually
means you're quite healthy which is low
is my mind yeah if you're a heartbeat
even if it's at 60 beats per minute is
the exact same amount of time in between
every single beat that means that your
heart is working on something that means
you're it is actually working I should
say it's not just relaxing I can't
that's so crazy to me as I said to you
the other night it was like I would
think that if you were super healthy
your heart would be the most consistent
thing out there because when you think
about it relaxation your breath is not
labored it's not very
it's not very uniform between breaths
but what you need to do something your
breath is actually very uniformed that's
true but when you're just kind of
chillin you're just like breathin you
just breathe
when you relaxing your heart is just
beating this is not anything else
so this tracks that and based upon those
metrics all together it gives you like
an assessment of your readiness of the
day and it allows you to see whether or
not this particular day is a recovery
day or if you can push yourself a little
bit harder than sham randomly bad and
it's it's useful because I personally
think that fitness trackers have a
wealth of information what you do with
that information is the next step that
most people don't understand yet yes so
that's why I like this
the state level the world I don't know
what I would give in that case but if it
weren't going to be something contact
like I don't know I mean even these
GoPros that are right here yeah sir
pretty awesome shooting this with the
GoPro Hero seven if you're watching the
video the Sun is getting darkness that's
getting darker rather like the sun's
going away because of daylight savings
so hopefully the video looks fine right
now
yeah the ghosts have been really great
and we've actually used it to get some
awesome footage of Jesse driving this
car thank you friend not visible that
disrupter the disrupter yet again the
the the the imagination of mr. robot is
why I heard that at those two turned by
heard that term muttered in the video I
was like yes oh my god it's just the
coolest name I am so grateful to hear
you say that because I found it to be
the most derivative like tech tech
buzzword bro nonsense stuff like I the
only reason I say lunch might be coming
for you the only reason I called it I
called it the disruptors because they is
literally the most perfect award name
yeah we do go back to phones with this
one at any one I think I even said in
the video anyone who's ever followed
phones for even the last year knows
already what this is and it's not
because of
of all the branding but but really the
red hydrogen one really was no yeah the
one plus 60 yeah which I love because
like okay so just just just so we can
get into like the general information
about that we've used to sharing
reminiscing in a more general sense
phone of fun of the best fun I don't
remember what you're used was fun of you
say it was part of the year yeah here
very very difficult to come to that
conclusion but again we'll talk to it
we'll talk to it a little bit later the
hallway may 28 Pro is what I consider to
be the front of the year the reason I
wanted to bring that up in this
particular portion of the discussion is
of cause I have I on a personal level as
GV I have yet to finish all of the
reviews of all the funds just such a
busy time as you can see but if I had to
think of it right now now what fun I
think
the phone of the early Teddy between
those two Oh between the one was 60 and
the maintain a brownie pro and he's
interesting part of the reason is
because the availability of the one plus
60 is such a compelling part of that
package Emily should probably reiterate
right now that we're coming from an
American perspective churro is and the
60 hitting carrier shelves the first one
plus to be sold in a carrier store that
is huge for us
literally available all over the US no
and to be honest pretty huge for oneplus
2 with their demand for the 60 up 86%
everything up over there yeah brilliant
props to them and also it's just really
great to see that a solid maybe even
more than solid phone is getting the
exposure and the for distribution that
it yeah deserves and even that you were
saying it's now we do come from up more
the u.s. centric perspective but if you
were to compare the mall plus 6 to you
that means
the may 20 pro is far more than that in
how many places it's available to dusty
definitely unless you have County of
Europe you have India each South
America's is available not only
different e-commerce channels easily and
that's something it is available to you
Congress isn't that's what I meant to
say which is actually not something to
be enjoyed
very true but just let's just stick with
a 16-4 one second yeah I want to say
that like I think I've seen a little bit
of pushback in the comments I want to
say it's totally justified
I think everyone's sort of tired of
one-plus doing this thing every year
that they do where they're like hey we
made a really great phone at a really
affordable price but we kind of kept
bumped up the price if they do every
single generation and by the way don't
tell me that don't tell me that keeping
that eliminating the lower storage
option is not bumping up the price yes
this is the same as the last 128 gig one
plus phone but when you eliminate the 64
gig or whatever that tier was your de
facto increasing the price don't get
taken in by that crap guys secondly you
know oneplus has also leaned on this
branding for a long time it's like yeah
with it we're the alternative where the
where they you know you don't have to
pay this much for your phone you should
buy this one and they've leaned on the
community angle for a long time or it's
just like we you helped us design the
phones it's like yeah that was true you
probably would have kept in the
notification light than the headphone
jack there's a lot of things to complain
about with the oneplus if you're a 1
plus fan triple what struck me about the
60 was it's it's the first one for
normal people that normal people can buy
and that I can recommend without and
that I can recommend without saying yeah
you gotta buy it unlocked and you gotta
you should get it on Amazon or whatever
or oneplus X no just go in here t-mobile
store buy it or buy it unlock to use it
on Verizon and you're gonna get a great
experience for 550 bucks that's
fantastic I hold I wholeheartedly agree
they also have to give some credit where
credit's to that despite some of the
choices that warpless is made to remove
certain features like the headphone jack
at least they're putting an effort to
make sure that those walls are at least
addressed by creating a great twenty
dollar pair of earphones in the USBC
points by creating a great opportunity
to make nineteen dollars and ten cents
and that is that is the harsh reality of
it but i would be more upset about it if
those were crappy ear foods and they
just were not for the record are these
the ones you talked to me on the other
day yeah the microphone is a low to hear
everyone around me plus me and it was
hard to hear me because man hear the
person twenty feet away from you
digesting their meal they sound
fantastic and they're they're usually
excess they even then oneplus also has
the bollocks wireless which themselves
if you're a blue tooth person at all
those are really good
holidays not really great you know and
at least are trying to address those
things in certain ways yes it would be
best if they have the end from Jack and
just kind of call it a day on that but
you know at least you can recommend to I
could recommend the bullet I actually
recommend the bullet or less to be is a
good yeah and on the flip side of the
gauge I'll call out another one of my
stay mobile award winners with the Sony
WH let's write 1000 x m3 or the mark
threes there are $350 but I love that
you can they're the best over-the-air
Bluetooth headphones I have ever used
and I love that you can buy those and a1
plus 60 and still come away paying I
think like a couple dollars less than
you would like a note 9 or and I found
yeah at their launch prices obviously
all the fountain prices have come down
for the holidays and even then I'm
running yeah that's true but node 9 was
close though it was ya know 9 is still a
beast and every time I use it we've been
using on this trip a lot cuz folks I
don't know if you know California big
state not covered by every Network
my only Verizon SIM is in the Verizon is
in the note 9 so every time I pick it up
to use it on this trip I'm like oh god I
forgot how much I love this phone was
that your unit provided by Samsung yeah
so okay good you just confirm something
for me that I have been meaning to test
if a verizon said would work and oh no
not yeah absolutely I have not done that
I just kept it in my pixel yeah okay
so with that the May 20 Pro okay this is
the I'm still it's a daunting task to
review this not only for pocket now but
also for myself because oh my god
there's so much to talk about
yeah I want to hear your take on them
820 Pro first I wish like I say the same
thing every time I wish I could give you
more info than is in my head right now
because I actually haven't used it
properly as a Dale
like for long enough to formulate a full
opinion and this is one of those phones
that requires that amount of actual
usage and I'm not just talking about
taking it out to like a food festival or
a food truck festival and taking
pictures with it and assessing it in
that situation you have to use it at
night you have to use it on a trip you
have to use it when you're out and about
because the camera is that versatile at
this point you have to wide-angle you
have the night mode you have good
stabilization in the video the video
mode may not be the most robust
interface which we've learnt over the
last couple of days and so you have to
understand you have to understand that
this review I think this year is the
hardest one because what the oneplus 60
I can wholeheartedly recommend it to
everybody for the razor front to which
I'm reviewing right now it's a great
phone for what I call the unapologetic
the people who are like I I know exactly
what I'm buying I'm a razor fan I want
the whole world to know it so the
unapologetic for that the pixels for
like IG boyfriends and photo takers but
the meet Tony Pro it fits in so many
different categories in different ways
and them
I'm flabbergasted by how to succinctly
say that in a review well from my
perspective the may 20 pro is is a
hardware tour-de-force
yes I mean I'm I really mean it when I
say hardware because when it comes to
software I think we could have a whole
podcast episode this this length just
talking about the things I would change
about the software yeah um but I was
sitting there in that New York City
briefing getting the lowdown on the may
20 Pro a couple weeks ahead of its
launch and I realized a little more than
halfway through that briefing that I was
gonna have to reschedule with the entire
rest of my year because we had the
opportunity to go to London to spend
five days with it's shooting with the
may 20 pro in London and I needed to
take that I had said no and I needed to
reconsider because it between all of the
cameras that you mentioned the the
facial unlock stuff that no one really
has copied as well and I do mean copied
from the iPhone with the possible
exception of
yeah and the wireless charging and
reverse wireless charging which by the
way is the best crab Cruiser you bring
that to Thanksgiving dinner as I did and
you're like my girlfriend's dead his
phone was running low and it's like how
is that a galaxy s 9 pass over here I'll
just put my bait 20 Pro down face bump
down the table put it on top and I'm
giving a mature then 20 minutes later he
got 1% and I mean and then you take it
all the way into the industrial design
you know man and that the fact that
they've hidden this speaker in the USB
port like there's so many incredible
moves that hallway made in terms of
hardware that phone it it reminds me of
what it's like to get excited about a
phone again true like I'm excited about
the oneplus 60 in a very practical way
yes like it's like an easy Android phone
to recommend and it's probably the best
Android experience you can get from our
software perspective right now but for a
phone that like just inspires the
imagination I don't think you can do
better than m8 20 Pro this year ideally
just don't and you said it all about the
camera already we should say that we're
using a May 20 Pro as our primary mobile
camera for this shoot in this Hyundai
and up until today I have not regretted
that for a second I got to diagnose a
little problem yeah there's something
that he that he has to look a little bit
further into to make sure that it hasn't
been a trauma where it hasn't been a
more widespread issue yeah
Oh framerate problem and shooting
wide-angle video by the way we are
passing we're gonna that's Napa Sonoma
yeah I told you we were gonna pass
through this here we're gonna drive past
the windows XP Hill on this trip I think
we have but unfortunately it's not the
best no we can't show you - it's dark
before Shane I really hope the videos
looking good right now I am sure it's
not well with that in mind I actually
have actually had an idea we're at the
29 minute mark what if we were to cut it
that way the rest of the video tomorrow
we can do it during the day okay yeah I
want to do that is because I went ahead
I don't know if you saw strategically
set your award video discussion as the
first half of the podcast yay I did not
realize that because now we're at the
30-minute mark so if we were to cut
right now I can do like a transition
thing I'd be like hey we're back we
realize that the Sun was so down that we
just decided to the rest of the story of
the day it sounds like a good plan to
make brother see we cover all my Awards
was there a where those did the stay
mobile
well the other Nintendo switch but who
cares that's that's stay mobile and
three and then there's disruptor
there's best of and the oh then there's
viewers Choice Oh worst add add to that
yeah okay so I just remembered word cut
I just remembered that there was one
more and I think the reason why I have
forgot about it was because you were
still getting your entries for still M
as we record this all the time this goes
up the viewers Choice Award will have
been selected that is the final mr.
Mobile 2018 award and it's chosen by
viewers like you
so as I said I think it's probably too
late to vote by the time this airs but
should I give it well won't be a spoiler
well why don't you put in what like what
what the top three I believe the
trending top three were Galaxy Note 9
okay while we made 20 Pro and I don't
know I'd really don't I don't I don't
know what it wasn't wouldn't be
surprised if it was like the one plus
it's possible yeah yeah it may have been
iPhone 10's max I'm not sure but yeah so
I'm looking forward to seeing which one
wins and I I'm very very eager to have
that conversation in the comments
because anytime you do an awards thing
as you know everyone's got opinions and
that's what this was pretty cool about
it because we all have different
criteria for what best means right oh
yeah for sure that's bestest social it's
it it supposed to be nebulous yeah
you useless turn such an odd thing yeah
okay so with that in mind since the Sun
has gone down quite quickly once we
started recording this something that we
were halfway expecting we're gonna go
ahead and just sort of do a bit of a
transition from here we'll see you once
we have more Sun in our next segment it
sounds like a plan
the PocketNow weekly comes to you with
the help of casita by Lutron today I
want to talk to you about casita by
Lutron smart lighting control brought to
you by Lutron pioneers in smart home
technology with casita you can schedule
leader lights to come on at dusk so your
family always comes back to a weld at
home and it does so just by you saying
so with the help of Google assistant
Amazon Alexa the Apple home pod or
whatever smart speaker you might use in
fact you can connect casita to smart
thermostats from nest as well as smart
cameras smart locks and a whole bunch
more
for example our producer extraordinaire
Jules has set up his lights that you can
call for mood lighting whenever he
watches all of the movies he doesn't
have time to watch which leaves me
wondering what moods he actually has but
well whatever in any case get smart
lighting and get it the smart way with
caseta by Lutron just search for it cas
ETA or check out Lutron comm to learn
more cosecha by Lutron welcome home it's
a peace of mind welcome back with the
PBS telethon we have switch seats this
time it's the day after that original
first half of the podcast so yeah after
coming back from our break yesterday or
rather in the previous segment we were
talking about
his awards the best products of 2018 as
a worker I kind of just want to talk for
a little bit
I'm very casually about 2018 in general
like I feel like this year has been if
things have been ramping up to bed
as I've said some more device releases
like higher frequencies right this year
was like the craziest in recent memory
it's crazy because I think we said that
about 17 as well oh really yeah well at
least I did I was like oh my god I can't
believe our phones are back baby we're
not it's not boring anymore and then
yeah this year just October absolutely
crushed it yeah not necessarily in terms
of quality though that may be true but
just the quantity stuff
sadly you had phones everywhere wasn't
deniz I post something on Instagram
about she did yeah should free tech
reviewer she had a little pose where it
looked like she was being a little
bashful and she was like oh my god I
just wish and then if you if you look at
it and you see someone wrote they just
wish smartphones would stop yeah but I'm
glad that it only really came up in
mainly October I'm glad that the entire
year did quite feel like oh you know
very surely Suzie lookin fine
getting a chance to catch up now and you
know you post a video of when you post
it and then what fortunately in our line
of work there's always someone there
ready to say I'm puns late like always
then you can get a nice good rush of
satisfaction by banning them for a few
we've been having so many discussions
about
of a creator the life of a tech youtuber
I don't know what kind of term you want
to say but yeah there's so many little
quirks to the song there are and this is
only like one facet of it's the fact
that these phone manufacturers just
don't seem like they want to stop
there's so many phones that came out
this year that even in the first half of
the year I feel like some people may
have kind of forgotten and I think
that's a bit of a travesty I mean the
Gallup the Galaxy S nine for example the
LG G seven even HTC phones from earlier
of the year that weren't exciting when
they were first being announced
the domain itself and that's even a more
recent release that is already feeling
overshadowed by four phones just after
it definitely and that's the pace of
this industry it's crazy which ones do
you are you do particular one thing
you're like said aren't getting getting
the FaceTime and it worked pretty much
pretty much ideology device yeah LG has
been a real sleepy sleepy time this year
yeah I mean there are some incredibly
sound things that are being done with
their phones like the boombox
yeah sorry I don't mean to say that like
the products are snoozefest sigh just
made like it seems like every time LG
has released something it's immediate
superseded by something more splash
where they were Buzz worthy or it didn't
really take hold in a way like g7 yeah
you didn't have a company as I recall
they were there was maybe one carrier
partnership with that right
it's probably just eighteen T right it's
a sprint hosted sprint okay I can't
remember how I ever been and then so
that was kind of a real stall in the US
don't you know citation needed don't
quote me on that one but as I recall the
carrier Gil's worked out is intense on
that and then the forty rolls around in
v40 is like we're on a every carrier and
we're all like hooray and then I think
something like twelve hours later the
p20 Pro drops it sort of just sucks all
the air and s oh poor LG it's hard to
its high can appreciate the fact that
it's hard for these companies to know
when
so they don't exactly know what the
training will do to a productivity cycle
and it must be tough I feel for them
they don't know as much as like they
have a release window and they have to
strategically you know it make the think
the most of it I will say if I was LG I
made my same move on be 40 because
Huawei p20 Pro doesn't launch at the
United States that's true so on one on
one hand like yeah and I don't mean to
say that help she has been a
disappointment by any stretch the
imagination there's certainly things I
could have been done to not only not
only get the phone in front of more
eyeballs but also in terms of some of
the features because obviously so many
phones have come out that we're starting
to see features actually proliferate and
even more foam it's like the wide-angle
is now a thing in more than just LG
phones for example yeah so it's these
about that yeah you've been using it
actually the beats when you travel I've
been using them a trained pro on this
trip almost it's almost exclusively just
which is the node 9 for today probably
bust out that be 44 some of the interior
shots tomorrow just so we can evaluate
its wine and versus p20 throw a little
bit more now that's updates and all that
means me crazy sorry May 20 program name
it's a little hard for me to IP ok so
some tangent it slow hard for me to do
the turning my head
to see the the other Lane because of the
mic but it's night it's use it in the
cluster I was about to say it's nice as
we're doing this road trip just another
little tension a little bit of context
awareness here we're on our way to yet
another landmark but it's not going to
be Tahoe the reasons why you can see in
about this particular vehicle right now
and I'm in the driver's seat is it fair
for me to say I want to talk my wants
and ask you what your what has liked you
to warn me before so I can think about
it I know and at the same time I'm
thinking of myself like just how far do
we want to go with this in particular
we're not I don't want to disparage
anybody we just want to be empirical we
want to be objective about I'm not
worried about that I'm just worried
about being able to remember and it's
generally a disappointing product will
come and go and then you just kind of
forget about it there's no time you have
to go think about the next thing people
care about I will say the first thing
that jumps to mind for me
and I'm sorry I don't know if you want
to keep this to phones but I'll just
throw it out there triggered still
relates to it agree it's the surface
laptop 2 for Microsoft Oh everyone was
telling me that that I remember when it
was announced I should practice that it
was announced people were so excited for
it yes and myself included okay because
the surface laptop first gen was such a
comfortable machine is a pretty machine
as well they came to that lovely blue
you can type on that Alcantara and have
the nice fabric beneath your palms
surface laptop to is basically the same
exact machine with some respect bumps on
the inside and while that's a typical
complaint you hear in this industry it's
not just that I'm annoyed that it's an
iterative bump I'm annoyed that they
didn't do the one thing that would have
made it a 20-18 machine which has put
USB C in it I know I'm a broken record
about this but guys if you don't have
USB C in in your product I don't care if
your talk about an earbud charging case
or a laptop desktop replacement laptop
yeah you I can't take it seriously
you're already shooting yourself in the
foot in terms of like ubiquity among the
tech yeah I mean people and people of my
comments are complaining because I've
said this in I think in the last three
videos but yeah I can now charge
everything I carry with me on with one
cable and if that cable if that is not
true then I'm not gonna carry that
product I'm sorry the server's laptop
too has no place in my bag if I have to
carry around a surface blade charger
with me you know it's it's funny you
mentioned that because I feel the same
way in a slightly pivoted manner I have
been testing USB see earbuds recently
and I love the fact that we're finally
getting to a point where these earbuds
could actually work with other devices
than the ones they're meant to
complement so for example the the Razer
hammerhead USB sieve noise cancelling
headphones that actually thinks I'm
pretty good with the noise cancelling is
what I love about them they're not going
to really noise cancel everything out
but even just a little bit goes a long
way sometimes they work with my mate
book extra oh yeah that is nice yeah I
can plug into the USB see and exactly
either of the two USB seaports and there
you go I have an I have audio now I was
like wow so if USB see isn't every
single product
I have then they can all work in
Congress and I yeah I kind of look
forward to that actually I understand
there's some people out there they're
gonna be like yeah but USBC audio
where's the headphone jacks blah blah
blah what's funny is that the maid book
has a headphone jack also but since I
only had those hammer heads on me
they still works and I was really happy
about that and it would be really nice
when USBC finally matures just to like
get off the like you know
brought to you by the USBC coalition ii
like us PC is still broken in a lot of
ways stuff that should be compatible it
isn't and even if the port fits it
doesn't mean that it's actually gonna
gonna work for you every time I'm glad
it worked for you in that kids yeah it's
far from Universal yeah but it's nice to
see that more things are starting to
sort of just fall in line true and yeah
I have an anchor power break that I
connect a bunch of things to in order to
charge my stuff I can connect my my
laptop or my phone or these GoPros yeah
to it to charge things and that's nice I
hope it becomes more and more prevalent
neither a great example of a USBC
embrace ersatz hero 5 or 6 I've got I
can't remember to ask I'm fantastic
do not make me carry around an old
microUSB cable to charge my stuff I
stopped a few of my back yeah I just
can't get it away from it right yeah cuz
like the minute you think you're free of
it like a company will release a
SmartWatch and they'll use a dock that's
like you know it has a micro USB port
but you guys where are you on sorry I
was waiting for that we had a less
traffic subsonic situation I was being
very nice and that person was it's funny
when you have that little pause it's
like an awkward handshake you know you
go oh it's he bone collision yeah
exactly
at least they looked really slow I was
like okay okay so you just mentioned
smartwatches like where where do you
stand on smartwatches in 2018 after
everything we've seen while we waited
basically all year for the new version
of Google's where OS to come out right
and that version looks pretty cool now
that we've gotten to play with it a
little bit and it's starting to trickle
out on devices but so far the only thing
I've used it on for a long time is the
LG watch w7o and I'm still very envious
of you for having that but here's the
thing it's not a typical wear OS
experience because it it's the watch
that has the analogue hands mounted over
the display yeah and that's fun that's a
cool little thing it makes this a very
special experience but it also
introduces a ton a ton of compromises
because the production pipeline was
longer so they had to use the old
Snapdragon wear 2100 no it's got I
couldn't did the same thing I was so
disappointed yeah there's no heart rate
sensor which I don't really care about
some people do you know it's it doesn't
get the new battery life improvements
that the 3100 brings blah blah blah so
that's really frustrating and I feel
like we're still waiting for where OS to
get some traction I think once fossil
finally kicks in with all of its new
3100 stuff did they just fall support
right yeah or but I'll talk about the
whole fossil group Oh God and you know
you we've really gotten to the Montblanc
out which should be waiting for me and
think I get to move into that one next
nice a thousand-dollar SmartWatch true
which is absurd and never will not be
absolutely out until these things
continue on they last for five years
is not very good investment right I've
made it very clear in my my last one or
two years of being in this industry such
a proponent of the hybrids now of a
hybrid SmartWatch yeah I love them so
much no you had a bomb too right yeah
yeah yeah I don't I can't get into I'm
like I think they're they're really
smart but I still use a lot of the
features of smart much I love reading
holy emails I'm a smart one clothing
like that's archived not me yeah you
know I just I just keep going back to
the same thing I know I don't want to
sound like a broken record now either
but if I'm going to spend that much time
looking at the screen on my wrist I
might as well just use that time looking
at those smart phones straight anyway
sure unless you're driving or you don't
want to pull your phone out of your
pocket
well I mean this this experience
notwithstanding I'm generally not
looking at any of those things about
driving anyway yeah and Angie no it does
not come through Android auto so it's
not like a nice try good yeah yeah by
design I don't know I mean I feel like
not much has changed the smart much
space this year and we just I sort of
wanted it to I wanted this to be the
second coming of Android wear but we'll
have to wait until next year to see if
to see if that pans out and I will set
the software is definitely better and
the hardware is a lot of interesting
potential
yeah how about these trends that we're
starting to see especially in very
recent months the certain form factors
returning to smartphones like this
slider
you got the Oppo find X ID the Xiaomi B
makes three he'll set the owner magic to
I prefer the mechanical like physical
slide over the motor personally yeah I
get that the find X motor is super cool
it is but I I was saying before that I
wanted to do a video on Thanksgiving
about what I'm thankful for this year
and I wanted to be controversial about
what's going on perhaps off-roading over
there is off-road oh no they weren't
off-road and there's a road that we
couldn't see and they were thrown up
water that was a puddle through
splashing what is this I was in Korea
this is a branded vehicle it's a
culligan water vehicle Oh interesting
dilemma in that pure water wells now
we've got some coming out of tail but we
do we could done it yeah we were told
not to drink it though yeah no no no I I
wanted to do a video on Thanksgiving
about what I'm thankful for in tech in
2018 yeah and I also wanted to be a
little bit controversial and say I'm
actually thankful for the knotch
not because I asked for the dodged a
bullet being a contrarian here we go
here we are it's not because I actually
like the notch it's because I love that
it made
companies getting you again getting
imaginative most definitely get unique
get creative with their solutions so
that they didn't have to resort some
actions and I think the 510 was the
first ones really next I'll find X I
keep saying it's confusing I think the
fight tent was the first one to really
capture the the consciousness a little
bit because it was like owners back all
looks so cool it's really it looks
really awesome and it's like so so
flashy but then that's lighter for Drive
just absolutely adoring that right now
once I got my hands on the show me and I
don't have it yet for a review that is
when I was in China and I was playing
with it was just click click click click
click like click like all day it was so
most definitely I miss moving parts on
phones to an unreasonable degree you
always get people coming out of the
Woodworks saying it's a valid point I
get it more moving parts the more
opportunity for failure but like I said
I think in that Oppo find X video that I
made like we went guys we went a decade
where the clamshell form vector was the
most prevalent in
it's back when dumb phones were the only
phones yeah and you know yeah sometimes
flips broke most of the time they didn't
yes well you know when you engineer a
product you can deal with a moving part
you know it's okay and it's not like
we're gonna be holding these things that
eight years gone like I hope my phone
doesn't break you're gonna buy a new one
in two years yeah
potentially now you said clamshell on a
crappy but it's not reality it is the it
is the reality
that's where tech has gone that's what
the last few years have shown us like
you're not gonna get a smartphone and
then use it for a long long time I just
made this point in my video that I said
to go live about my first cell phone oh
yeah thank the you know a cell phone
that smarts right this phone has gotten
so old that the petroleum the the
petroleum in the rubber has started to
destabilize the plastic is like turning
into a liquid at some points of the body
and
2001 like these things were never meant
to last even back then yeah we have been
in this throwaway consumer culture since
then
it's just the way the way it is right
now
you mentioned clamshell I have this you
what you were mentioning like between
parts of a clamshell and if they were
broken and whatnot I don't think
anyone's ever like like bent they're
there they're flipped thumbs and the
other direction so much that it actually
cracked in half I've never seen anybody
with like two halves of a clamshell
phone you've never worked in a sprint
retail store oh sure whether busting all
the time but you know it's it's just
like people think that that's gonna
happen at the moment you introduce a
moving part to something enough yeah not
if it's well built it was not well built
it's almost like we should have a cadre
of reviewers who cover this stuff tell
you that you might want to watch out for
indeed and that is exactly what people
are going to be asking us when foldables
yeah finally come in so did you watch
the the Samsung developer okay well you
know of the the F or whatever they're
calling it the Flex what I'm still I'm
still not too sure what the terminology
should be but the foldable and how
excited are you for that particular
trend that we finally got and
announcement about it yeah I think it's
going to be a lot of really bad products
first you're gonna have compromises in
the screen remember the LG G flex from
back in the day I miss it it had a curvy
- and had that curved display but in
order to get that they had
this display that like couldn't
reproduce whites they can look like wet
newspaper I think someone said it was a
perfect characterization of those colors
but then by the second generation that
display had gotten a lot better so we're
gonna see a lot of compromises probably
gonna be a very very bad phone in its
first iteration and we'll have to we'll
have to wade through a few generations
until it gets good what's your what's
your take on Google saying that they
will support this new form factor
wholeheartedly with Android like what
are they use case scenarios other than
is really like is it just gonna be big
screen experience because I would hope
that there is some sort of some sort of
functionality that comes with the fact
that the screen wise you fold upon
itself I don't know I just I just keep
thinking to myself that X on em or
enshrine head no it's the opposite
direction by ZTE folding both folding
phone yeah that the dual screen or
anything but if you have two full-sized
smartphone screens that together can be
used as a function bigger apparatus can
you like can you cut the middle and use
a dual screen experience like can that
be an X to get the kid that can multi
window finally become yes actually what
is meant to be yeah I think again but
then you've got to
well factor in a bunch of time for
developers to rebuild their apps are
they going to do that right even now you
long press the button in Android and
it's like the actor using doesn't
support melting but no you can't do that
you know and multi-window has been
posted after it for a couple generations
so
it's all gonna be weather people stand
up and demand that I think and then
whether Google follows through and
incentivizes developers to to build for
that
the point is we don't know it's so it's
such a strange idea and we have no idea
at this point what whatever strategies
are yeah I just like that if like having
a big old screen when you want and
having a pocket ball device money now
yeah even though things gonna be thick I
know it's gonna be thick and this is one
of the things gonna suck about it at
first yeah and but we've always said
that you know for for features or bigger
batteries we wouldn't mind a bigger
device this is like kind of going all-in
on that idea yeah we will test that with
with this category of devices but I
think a lot of you know the consumer
stuff that's worth buying is a long ways
yeah I haven't even used convertible
laptops or a convertible tech a whole
lot I remember the last thing I was
super jazzed about was the Isuzu
transformers where you can put the phone
into a dog that binky that me to become
a tablet oh there's the phone
my apologies it is tad fun well yeah and
you even you you're using the pixels
late right now that can be technically
converted it's like a laptop experience
because the keyboard that you can attach
to it yeah I don't know I'm still
conventional in the sense that I use a
general laptop I haven't used to be
convertible so that this might actually
be a new friends here for me that a
phone can become a tablet
like what's weird as I'm with you on
that like you know I find Microsoft's
surface line like the regular surface
you know the tablet with the optional
keyboard to be fascinating and
futuristic and awesome but also totally
not compatible with my use case I'm
literally doing laptop work so often
than for me the surface laptop is a much
better fit resource book or something so
I feel you're completely on that so
while I advocate for these bigger form
factors sometimes man
there's some movies have a proven design
yeah you just get yeah sometimes the the
tried and true yes should always be
around even if the new stuff is is
encroaching on it yeah I mean iPad pro a
great example it's just not I love all
the people who are saying it's the best
iPad ever made
still iOS like it's not going to replace
my laptop anytime soon yeah although you
know I am starting to see now with this
generation glimmers of that possible
future watching Jonathan Morrison added
a full video on an iPad pro on YouTube
was he was quite an experience I did not
actually believe that actually didn't
watch that what did what did he use was
it rush and now it wasn't Russia was
another programmer I can't cyber
director comments comments help us out
whatever it was it was a it was
something to watch a video edited on an
iPad with no fans in 4k with an Apple
pencil instead of a mouse know what I
mean that's my dream yeah so I don't
have to carry around a big MacBook Pro
you know
yeah that it's true or or like I was
saying I think he would there was last
week or the week before bring the iPad
pro and I'm a committee and use that new
product that someone used to make that
upon order you had to make it a monitor
that's a fairly portable set yeah you
got a plug-in but right but it's a
stopgap yeah exactly that's that's
that's an exciting possible future
mm-hmm so for these for these last
number of minutes for this potentially
one-hour show this is yeah we're we're
about there what are you looking forward
to 2019 then because I know we're gonna
see each other next week in Hawaii
there's still the entire month of
December to like look back on 2018 for
but I figured this is a perfect way for
us to do it in this car for the long
haul that we have so why not look a
little bit more in the future once 2019
got for you that you think you're gonna
and I have to like could just go on the
fly real quick cuz I haven't thought
about this question long enough for a
better answer but I will say this the
Lenovo yoga see 9:30
by the way Lenovo maybe think about
think about the brand names like Sony WH
1000 xm3 exact killer yeah I'm drooling
already didn't I call them when I first
got the market oohs I called him to
cancel cans that's I remember that take
a tacky name like that over jumble of
numbers and letters well even then like
although nothing on this topic you know
if it's a yoga right why not name it
some sort of pose you've crossed the
line the yoga the yoga asana the Yolo
called our Federal Credit Union this
sounds good
oh my goodness was actually actually
Yolo federal pay you and that's pretty
cool hey so what I'm saying is a laptop
that and the reason I bring it up is
because what I'm looking forward to in
2019 is more more devices that rethink
what their role is
how many laptops have I played with that
have a have a stylus that you can use
with them but there's no place to put
the stylus you have to carry it in your
bag the C 930 gives you a silo like a
Galaxy Note how many laptops have I had
to put a sticker over the front facing
camera on because I'm either paranoid or
prudent depending on your point of view
oh man that's a whole podcast right
there is the scene on 30 puts a cover
right in there it's built into this
friggin laptop and it's not thick it's
not dumb it puts a massive sound bar and
hinge it's just a used it for judaize I
don't know if it's a great laptop it
could be total crap from what if it
delivers on it on making a solid Windows
experience it's my favorite my new
favorite laptop so for 2019 I'm looking
forward to existing form factors that
realize they can do things better and
doing those things better and
also new little categories coming back
like that little GoPro what's it not
come from oh the people did have done
invite me to their events and I don't
like the Osmo pocket yeah DJ I yeah the
DJI Osmo pocket wait looks like a nice
little nifty camera I love that you can
connect that thing to any smartphone on
the side over on the side make it a big
old monitor genius yeah and it's
bringing back that handheld a digital
camera that we had back in the days of
flare blip actly does that so much so
yeah we'll see if it survives her if
people say you don't know the
stabilization I get on my iPhone 10s or
my pixel three is fine yeah but I
I love I love it I love it any time a
company is like let's experiment with
either a new thing or making an old
thing better refresh an old thing yeah
yeah I completely agree i I'm pretty
much in the same boat I actually look
forward to whatever the next generation
of our gaming consoles are that's what I
really want to see happen because the
ps4 and the Xbox are really due for a
refresh or an upgrade of some sort but
on the on the topic of pocket and mobile
apparently there might be a new switch
and I'm really curious what that would
look like I've heard that rumor too yeah
the switches switch to switch to switch
Pro perhaps and I want to know what that
would look like and to see if other
companies are going to move towards that
because if there's one thing that we're
seeing a lot more of in 2018 this is a
trend we didn't even really touch upon
in this podcast the gaming phone is now
a thing and I want to see that evolution
so if the switch Pro comes out with
Nintendo making more IPS not just for it
but also for mobile everyone else gust
up to game of man and it looks like
they're trying it looks like a soos
razor everyone's trying gun Shami make
nubia makes one yeah I'm looking forward
to seeing more of that because a
mentality I've always had in the
computing realm is a gaming machine is
so it can be so powerful and so good
that it can handle pretty much any other
task right so a gaming phone hopefully
will fit that description as well a
forward to that ya know I strongly agree
with that and and that's another thing
where the ecosystem has to keep up with
it and catch up with it
like I've had these gaming phones and
it's been great but frankly mobile games
as they stand right now are still not as
compelling to me as the kind of stuff
you can get on even the switch it's a
lot of people you know just like turn
their noses up at because you can't play
yeah Red Dead Redemption 2 on it you
know because it's not a very it's not a
parent console that's all about power
yeah but it still has those Nintendo
exclusive titles that I think are worth
the price tag along well I mean there's
this rumor going around that a patent
because a patent will suggest signed off
on by Sony that kind of was like a vida
of Vita successors Oh
what was the Aveda the Vita was their
portable they're the PS Vita oh yeah
remember that clumsy product plays
better in house of cards yes Gavin
Spacely hey is that a PS Vita Sodhi
woody okay well yeah I think we're on
our way to our next destination is it
gonna do monetize this podcast if I say
it we're literally going to a monument
called the glory hole
a glory hole you can give them a quick
explanation because I've never even
known about this thing we're just one of
my wineries and that's all I want to go
to
this is amazing actually I should take
some more video it's beautiful here in
Northern California we're going to a big
old drain do a youtube search for a
glory hole right no no don't Google do a
search for Hut The Devil's Gate yes
we're just big drain you'll find it yeah
I'm being trained uh Sonoma in Sonoma
California the minute you see the
thumbnail you will know what we're
talking about yes uh since we're since
we're here I'm driving I can't
necessarily look at the script that
Jules makes me every single week I'm
gonna go ahead and do the outro after
this so thank you so much for being on
brother hey thank you so much or even
having your you're the one who had me on
this Drive so I have to thank you so so
happy I wouldn't know if I would have
had it any other way that's amazing
