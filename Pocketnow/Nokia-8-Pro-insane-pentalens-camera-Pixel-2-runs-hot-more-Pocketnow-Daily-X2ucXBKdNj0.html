pro packing a jaw-dropping Penta lens
camera yes five lenses it seems like not
only Apple is struggling with iPhone 10
sales and Samsung is also being affected
and apparently pixel devices are heating
up to dangerous temperatures I'm Jaime
Rivera and definitely the punching bag
for this year is the pixel to excel even
with how much we love that phone
this is pocket out daily as always we
try to begin the official news with
deals if you're in the market for
carrier service Cricut wants to make
that easy for you they've got a deal
where if you switch before March 29 they
will give you a Galaxy s8 50% off
meaning 350 bucks for the phone and
obviously there are a couple of
conditions but the conditions aren't
really that difficult you can learn more
about them at the description and for
those of you that think that only Apple
is suffering with the case of the iPhone
10 not selling as much as the company
was predicting well that's not only the
case there are a couple of suppliers
that are currently struggling because
obviously their numbers were very highly
negotiated by Apple Samsung being one of
them I mean the company is the one
that's providing the AMOLED displays for
this phone obviously they're not meeting
what they were expecting because the
iPhone said is not reaching that well
will a Cupertino do going forward if we
can't wait to see and speaking of we
can't wait to see I mean we already hear
rumors and when we should expect of you
WD see usually it happens in early June
and according to some trusted sources it
should happen on the first week remember
the Worldwide Developer Conference is
mostly to see what Apple is going to do
about software but there are some
sources that claim that hardware is
gonna play a big deal at this event and
let's hope we do get something if you've
been noticing some slowdowns and
overheating on your Google pixel -
apparently you are not alone we've got
some customers complaining of
temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius
which is a lot in Fahrenheit too much
actually and according to the complaints
it seems that the phone even charged is
slower and obviously we can't wait to
see what happens with Google's response
to this as apparently this is all after
the recent update and finally the very
hot nuisance
have to do with the nokia 8 Pro believe
it or not usually we leave the hot news
for something else but Nokia welcome
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that this phone will bring up Penta lens
camera yeah 5 lenses now if you see the
modules and this is mostly from the
previous leaks of the Nokia 10 which
apparently is now going to be called a
Nokia pro it seems that these five
lenses won't necessarily work like
colonel ins it seems that you can rotate
the module in order to activate the
other two lenses that are going to be
hidden or three makes a lot of sense I
mean we've seen this design in cameras
from many many years ago makes a lot of
sense to bring it to you know
smartphones but in today's question what
do you think Nokia is planning to do
with five lenses I mean hey if they gave
me a macro and a wide-angle and a zoom
lens and also a monochrome and then the
primary sensor then sure why not
apparently the lens at the bottom is
gonna be the primary and then everything
rotates at the top so can't wait to see
that leave us a comment down below we'd
