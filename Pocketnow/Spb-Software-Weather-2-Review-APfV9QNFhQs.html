pacquiao calm today I'm to be talking
about a new program called spb mobile
weather 2.0 so we're in our spb mobile
shell program right here we're going to
flip through this is on the Xperia I'm
going to flip through ok there goes and
you see this little weather icon right
here it tells you the current weather
actually it tells you that the high of
today and the low of today we're going
to click on that and it's actually going
to bring up our current weather which is
34 degrees in Seattle it's pretty cold
so you have these various cities that
you can select and for each day it shows
a four-day forecast you can select on
each one and I'll bring up a quarter pro
like quarter setting so you have night
morning day and evening you can go back
and just flip through and just like on
spb mobile shell you can scroll through
each city that you selected I've
selected various cities we can go back
and this is where you edit your cities
and you can select your main startup
city so I select this one because that's
where I live and it's pretty easy
there's up to 10,000 different cities
that are on here and there always being
updated all the time but spb and then
you can select by country by airport and
even by gps location you can get your
gps location from your device so that's
pretty cool we're just going to pick one
because it won't let me go back if I
don't so there you go ok so then another
cool feature this new program is the
fact that you have this globe then you
can scroll and move the globe whatever
you want but it'll actually scroll
through all the the cities that you
select so for New York whatever which is
right there and you hit this little play
or stop button and I'll show you that
the sky or there's four different other
settings you have satellite view
temperature and precipitation so it's
pretty nifty if you can watch them it's
kind of like google earth pro
or Google Earth I guess normal if you
have the weather setting on there and
you can zoom in and another great
integration about this program is that
it also works on your todays screen so
if you're running regular windows just
any normal windows mobile phone I'll
have to actually go out two panels on
this film so we can go back to the
Xperia panel the norm the default one
and as you can see here's the other
cities that are right there on your
today screen the cool thing about this
is it works on pretty much every device
spb said that they were able to
integrate this on every resolution
screen so if we look at this one this
one's pretty cool too because it's it's
this is the ATT tilt and it's pretty
basic I mean if it runs on this that
will pretty much run on everything so
you close it of this and another cool
thing about the spb mobile program or
SPD weather 2.0 is that you can change
the colors along with your theme for
your spb mobile shell
so whenever changes like that so it will
integrate exact directly with your spb
mobile shell so so there we go and this
one has the globe as well so thank you
for watching the zani web server Pardo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
