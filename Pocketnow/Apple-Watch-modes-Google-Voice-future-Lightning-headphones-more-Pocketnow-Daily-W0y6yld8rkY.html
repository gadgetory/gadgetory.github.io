to migrating google voice with hangouts
apple announces the official release
date for iOS 8 and for those of you
worried the Apple watch does play
left-handed as well I'm hi Mary Mehta
and before the thunderstorm outside
kills the power let's get the show on
the road this is walking out daily let's
begin today with what's sort of official
as those of you interested in the Lumia
735 selfie phone or the 830 which is a
flagship that is not really a flagship
with mere tiered specs and stuff like
that well these phones are coming to the
United States verizon has just confirmed
that they will be picking up the 735
which is great an AT&amp;amp;T is going to be
picking up the 830 the only problem is
we don't have any specific dates for
this so stay tuned we'll keep you posted
on when that happened now one of the
biggest concerns we have with the Apple
watch is the fact that everything looked
great for right-handed people we did not
notice if there was a left-handed mode
or not but journalists have already
contacted apple an apple has responded
that you can flip the display and you
can flip the straps in a way to use it
left hand that though we still not sure
how exactly is that digital crown going
to perform with your watch on the other
side so obviously we can't wait to test
the watch out even though that is going
to happen until 2015 and for those of
you wondering when exactly is iOS 8
going to be announced one of the biggest
questions we had yesterday with apple's
event it turns out that Apple has
already confirmed that it will be
available for everybody on September 17
so the gold master candidate has already
reached developers this is pretty much
the final build of iOS 8 hopefully it's
not as buggy as the previous ones we
will be testing and reporting back and
hopefully you will get a taste of iowa's
a very soon now one thing that Apple did
not mention was one of the biggest
rumors that was heard of earlier this
year about Apple working on bringing
lightning porta support for audio for
high quality speakers and stereo systems
and also headphones but it turns out
that we already have a release the
philips fidelio m2l is compatible with
the Lightning port in order to give you
high fidelity audio which is not sure
exactly what it's going to launch and
the price tag is going to be another
thing that we're
questioning but they tuned as oddly it
is not a beats pair headphones and
finally for the concerning news of the
day those of you that hate google
hangouts raise your hands and that
includes me with passion I hate google
hangouts I hate the fact that you can't
really control a lot of things that is
so convoluted but still google voice
being one of my favorite applications is
sadly going to migrate google hangouts
reports had it that it was going to
happen and now it seems that migration
has already begun for some though we
haven't been able to confirm this and
yes you will be getting SMS text you
will be getting almost the same features
only in the google hangouts UI which i
would have preferred would have happened
backwards but that leads me to the
question of the day if you could choose
between google voice or google hangouts
which one would you pick which one would
you want to stay because in my case oh
god i really do not like google hangout
so on bias but leave us a comment down
below tell us do you like this change or
not friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video was filming sure you follow us i'm
talking out a comment subscribe change
channel as well you'd also follow me on
twitter hein underscored iveta please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hi nat rev it up thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
