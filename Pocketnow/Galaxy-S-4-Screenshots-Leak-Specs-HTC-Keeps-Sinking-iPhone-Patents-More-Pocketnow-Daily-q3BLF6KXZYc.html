where details HTC keeps sinking in sales
but boasting about the ones microphone
and no apple patents talk about the
future of the iphone I'm hi meri behna
at noon hungry and wishing smartphones
delivered pizza this is pocket now daily
let's start today talking about
blackberry and don't you just hate the
fact that these manufacturers can figure
out a way to give you a specific day
when they're gonna launch their
smartphones on carriers I mean they're
always like in the fall and the spring
and Apple always provide you with a date
but well we've got some rumors and yeah
I said rumors of the blackberry z10
reaching AT&amp;amp;T by March 14th and then
apparently t-mobile by March 27 it could
also be March fifteenth I believe with
AT&amp;amp;T there are some other rumors out
there but just stay tuned i wish they
figured it out now let's talk about HTC
we have a lot of hopes for the HTC One
and every single one of the editors at
parking now 11 as soon as HTC can bring
it to us but sadly well the company is
boasting over how well the microphone
technology on the smartphone is but we
still don't have a specific date for the
launch and another really sad part of
the news is the fact that there are
forty four percent down year-over-year
in sales so that phone can't get there
fast enough I mean HTC you really should
hurry up and man apple rumors have gone
from unbelievable to simply boring
recent new patents from Apple now have
them working on a new style of home
button which is actually
pressure-sensitive so it could be in the
future that you won't have to double tap
on the home button you will just have to
apply a certain amount of pressure which
is something I really don't know how
they're gonna figure out but let's move
into the unbelievable grounds as new
pens also have apple working on a stylus
for the iPhone and any of you that
remember the iphones of the original
iphones launched in 2007 when Steve Jobs
was talking about it he said who needs a
stylist so who needs these rumors in
these patents that'll probably just not
happen but stay tuned and now let's talk
about the company that actually invented
the modern stylus we've got new reports
of the Galaxy Note 3 and believe it or
not the phone is apparently going to get
bigger recent rumors have the company
working on a six point three inch
display smartphone Gigantor Godzilla
thing whatever but now more credible
reports have the company working on a
5.9 inch display device though I do hope
that they get rid of the bezel and the
buttons while they're at it because that
thing is just going to be something you
won't be able to carry given the fact
that you can make phone calls on the
Galaxy Note 8 anything is possible when
it comes to
Samsung and obviously that 1080p display
is also going to be there to stay tuned
and finally for the hot news of the day
we've got some screenshots of the galaxy
s4 specs and apparently we will be
getting a 1080p display we will be
getting a 13 megapixel camera which will
most probably be made by sony be the
same xperia z camera as it always is and
then we've also got the same two
gigabytes of ram double rumor then we
know the processor story it'll depend on
which country you are and we've also got
other screen shots that are mentioning
the eye tracking technology that we
talked about yesterday and aside from
that we've also got some head tracking
technology which makes you wonder what
they're going to use that for but that
leads you to the question of the day
what would you want on the next galaxy
s4 what is that specific killer feature
that if it came on the galaxy s4 you'd
either stay with Samsung or definitely
just move into the galaxy s4 when it
came out in my particular case with
everything that's already out in the
galaxy s3 or galaxy note 2 I would
definitely love the S Pen on the galaxy
s4 and I would definitely love a 1080p
display but what leave us a comment let
us know what you want in our particular
case the list is long we've got a lot of
leaks and a lot of things coming up so
we'll keep you posted on march 14 and of
course if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet broke make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com it

let's give this video a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I'm high memory that
up thanks for watching see you tomorrow
in our special edition of the pocket now
live where we predict what's going to
happen with the galaxy s4 ah the HTC
droid DNA probably one of the most
beautiful smart phone designs of the
year this 1080p display device made a
lot of headlines when it was launched in
japan as the j butterfly now that it's
made it to the united states on the
verizon network is it still worth you're
buying dollar sadly not everything is
perfect or was perfect than our review
