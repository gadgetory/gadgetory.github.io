Galaxy S ten has emerged and at this
point they should just give us the phone
according to some reports we could also
see a 5g variant of the galaxy F at
least in some countries and vivo is
bringing their own portlets phone with
the 2019 apex and it looks very good I'm
Jaime Rivera and join me in celebrating
the today's Thursday
for obvious reasons tomorrow this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a new iPad but you don't want to go
for the latest one because you want to
save a buck or to save $250 and go to
Best Buy because they've got the ten
point five inch variant for cheap and
then well we also have MacBook Pros that
are also significantly discounted
obviously it depends on the
specification so you're looking for it's
a four day deal thing I mean Apple we
don't recognize you now let's talk about
Apple a little more and the company's
future when it comes to manufacturing
parts I mean the company is making its
own chips now it seems they want to make
their own batteries the company has just
hired a high-level executive from
Samsung and it seems that the company's
investing in cobalt and a ton of things
to be able to make its own batteries we
don't really have a time frame for this
but let's hope that wasn't the guy in
charge of the galaxy note 7 now let's
talk about the 2019 vivo apex I mean you
saw Brandon's review on the regular
initial vivo apex at it oh baited with
that slide-out camera now the innovation
from vivo is a phone without ports
pretty much like what we saw from meizu
the specifications are reportedly crazy
12 gigs of ram in addition to the
qualcomm snapdragon 855 and 5g support
meaning not exactly sure when we're
getting that phone
and speaking of 5g let's talk about
Galaxy F I mean we don't know what this
product is gonna look like when we're
gonna get it we hear them to be see but
think about it is there are reports that
there is a 5g variant and I wonder
really if there's a point in launching a
variant that's not 5g meaning it's
either connected or not whatever the
case may be stay tuned
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with a full-blown gallery of
prototypes of the Samsung Galaxy S 10
and it's three variants s10 es10 and s10
plus Wow I mean there is no room for
imagination anymore the phones look
gorgeous the finishes look fantastic I'm
actually not complaining about what I
see I am highly recommend you look at
all the photos in the gallery and prom
is the price tag I mean reportedly the
s10 a is gonna cost around 800 bucks to
e so they're saying that the plus is
gonna cost around 1,600 I doubt that's
gonna work for you Sammy if that's the
case but let us know in the comments
down below one of you like them and -
how much would you be willing to pay
because in my case I mean I think Apple
has proven this year that charging too
much for phones is not a good idea leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on parking out on comment subscribe to
