pocketnow.com i have the LG optimus 2x
right here and we're going to do some
speed tests because it's got dual core
processors one here its Tegra 2 so
should be pretty quick so let's check it
out so first off I have quadrant
standard this is a benchmarking program
and you can see we got a pretty high
score here so you can see the optimus 2x
is way up there close to 2500 and
there's all the other devices have a
couple other benchmark programs that we
use here now a smart bench 2011 this one
does support multiple cores so it should
get some pretty good results and here's
our scores for the LG optimus 2x and see
it's a pretty good there a little bit
less than the motorola xoom with its 1.5
gigahertz processor but if we look down
here further down you see some slower
devices here galaxy s down there so
pretty good score we're kind of slowing
down with the scrolling though and
that's on smart bench 2011 and we have
one more this is linpack this is going
to be another benchmarking program and I
get 36 almost 37 m flops and we can
compare the top devices latest runs our
top 10 down here but you can't really
compare very easily with what your
device got with what others got
so there are some scores to see them all
droid x is at 18 HTC vision is at 60
next up let's see how websites render
how quickly they were in there so this
is the galaxy s 4g over here and i'm
going to hit them both at the same time
let's try that with the desktop version
both of these are on the same Wi-Fi
connection and they are very close still
downloading
and we are
there we go so let's see
performance-wise zooming in
let's try that again okay that one
really slow
multi-touch
ok it's still working
okay so there you have a little browser
comparison let's also try with HD 7 so
again we're going to do this it's
probably going to go to the mobile site
so
lge went over very quickly
and let's see the desktop site LG coming
up ahead
hd7 taking its sweet time
and then we finally have something going
on over here
and we can compare some responsiveness
with the zooming
see the lg's a little bit choppy or as
this is going pretty smoothly oh hey
looks like the browser crashed and we
lost that page okay well you get the
picture next up I downloaded the NVIDIA
Tegra zone app and this is just kind of
a little catalog of absolute designed to
take advantage of the Tegra 2 processors
so and let's see oops if I go here
choose available because it lists a lot
of games that are not actually available
we've only got what seven sound games
there so I bought one that I thought
wouldn't look cool samurai two and let's
actually just open it who knew there we
go and let's show you how pleased
so this is more like it and I got some
good 3d graphics in here and we're good
it's a samurai sword fighting begins in
sorry my that's a lot smoother putting
pretty nice graphics here anyway that is
the Tegra 2 processor it's working
pretty nice so there's your speed tests
of the optimus 2x this device is
available from negri electronics so
check that out if you think about buying
that and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
