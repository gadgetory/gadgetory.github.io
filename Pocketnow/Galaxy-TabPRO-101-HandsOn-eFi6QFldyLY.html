now Michael behind the camera Steelers
somewhere editing video and we are at
CES looking at some other tablets from
Samsung in this particular case the
galaxy tab 10.1 let's take a closer look
so we have previously seen the pros and
the notes and the tab pro 10.1 has
basically the same internals and the
same specifications as the previous
tablets of course we have the same
magazine UI which is currently replacing
touch with we have a 10.1 inch screen
which is a resolution of 2560 by 1600
and of course the home button and the
two capacitive buttons on the front
that's taking up the entire screen real
estate and front glass first looking at
it in comparison with a 12.1 and
cheerful through makes it a little bit
small but it's still a 10 inch tablet on
the back we have the same boat leather
backing with the stitching Samsung is
bringing that to the new model of
tablets this is a tab and not a note and
while we're at the back we're looking at
the 8 megapixel camera with the LED
flash and of course the sim card slot
and since we talked about this this is
the data connection enabled version it
runs on Snapdragon 800 processor
quad-core if it would be the Wi-Fi only
version it would run on the ex you know
by Brian no just thinking to look real
quick it is
very fluid as you can see both end
portrait and landscape and we are really
helping that Samsung managed to fix a
lot of the issues with lag and we're
trying to bug it down this is apparently
a demo unit everybody it's busy trying
to load and install and customize but so
far it is holding up very very well so
this is just a quick look at the tablet
we will have more on this and on other
Samsung products in the videos to come
first you'll then have been an Tom
Michael behind the camera I'm Taylor
doing video editing thank you very much
