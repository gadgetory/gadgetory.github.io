pocketnow.com and today we'll show you a
pretty fun game called prince of persia
HD and you can find this on windows
mobile marketplace for around four
dollars and ninety-nine cents so the
first thing you're going to do is
actually select your difficulty so I'm
just going to choose full of prints
because I'm not very good and we'll go
to chapter one wait for its load of
course ok so the controls on prince of
persia HD are pretty neat because you
use your on-screen d-pad and your attack
buttons over here so as you can see i
can move left and right up and down and
to jump I double tap up and now i can
continue through the game so here i can
double tap to get those let's see it
looks as though i've unlocked some sort
of video so that helps will climb up
this will go back let's see we need to
get onto this platform so i'll double
tap I'm climb up this wall will go back
ok so we'll continue through the game
and as you can see I have these vines
over here what you need to climb so all
you have to do is hit this button and
he'll climb on those vines so I go
across and it looks as though an enemy
is approaching so it gives me a little
blurb about the enemy so I can just
click here and I can attack him or I can
block and will just destroy this enemy
right now and it will continue through
the game
oh it looks as though we have some more
enemies here so we need to destroy them
okay so let's just go back to home so
this is another marketplace pic and this
is prince of persia HD and the game
controls are very nice on this game I'm
actually surprised to see how well they
do work and the game costs four dollars
and ninety-nine cents on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
