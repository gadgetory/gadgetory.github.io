lineup in sales last quarter Samson then
surprises us with the launch of the
galaxy s 4 Black Edition and Lenovo CEO
says that he can be both companies with
the purchase of Motorola I'm primary
betta and you know what they say Lenovo
if you can't beat them you join them
this is parking out daily let's firstly
off with some official news s consumer
intelligence research partners have just
launched their numbers for sales last
quarter and it is surprising that the
iphone is now winning in the United
States and they're actually winning by a
large number they own forty-five percent
of the smartphone market according to
these analytics and then Samsung is down
actually from thirty four percent to
thirty-one percent in this quarter
obviously because of the fact that we're
already waiting for the galaxy s5 but
weird because the Galaxy Note 3 was
launched so let's see how next quarter
shows up hopefully we will see more
galaxy phone and speaking of Samsung and
more galaxy phones the company has just
surprised this with a new black edition
of the galaxy s4 and galaxy s4 mini as
well now this is pretty much the same
galaxy s4 when it comes to internals and
the faceplate but the only difference is
that you get a new back cover and this
back cover is the new Fox leather that
we see on the Galaxy Note lineup which
is great it's great for us to see that
standardization the problem is that
obviously it is the same Snapdragon 600
processor it's the same specifications
and it's only available in Russia right
now so stay tuned we don't know what
will land on other countries now let's
talk about Microsoft as Bloomberg is now
reporting that they know who is the next
CEO of the company we've got satya
nadella's and i hope that i pronounced
that right which has worked for the
company for 20 years and apparently this
is the best candidate for CEO as this is
actually the only guy that hasn't talked
dirt about Microsoft's products whenever
been interviewed when compared to
Stephen Elop which that really happened
but honestly the sad news here is that
apparently somebody that's also stepping
down as bill gates as chairman once this
happens apparently somebody else will be
named which is really really bad as the
founders of Microsoft's are pretty much
gone hopefully this won't happen and if
you thought that Google had pretty much
given up on their whole hard work
project well it turns out that they have
in the company keeps snatching companies
that are
focused on wearables just like apple and
rumors happen that they're working on
more wearables like smartwatches aside
from google glass which is really
interesting because aside from that we
also have news that a susan acer are
preparing their smart watches that we
could probably see these at mwc so stay
tuned that's going to be the year of
smartwatches 2014 and finally for the
interesting news of the day even though
lenovo CEO came on record to state that
they didn't have a specific strategy to
revive motorola one of the things he did
say on another interview is the fact
that he is planning to the feet apple
and samsung in the next couple of years
with motorola as that combination is
actually making them the third biggest
smartphone manufacturer in the world
according to him really interesting
claims that leads you to the question of
the day do you think that actually
lenovo has the power to do this do you
think that they can defeat Apple and
Samsung because in my particular case
after using a couple of lenovo
smartphones i would say not a chance
especially with the fact that the Moto X
and moto G never really took off
significantly but leave us a comment
down below what do you think and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filmed she follow us on parking outcome
