photographers out there looking for a
nice mobile version of Lightroom for
your tablet first of all I agree
Lightroom is really poorly designed for
tablets it's not finger friendly at all
and can't just rely Aventis as
impossible to use second of all I found
something that's compatible with
Lightroom and works a lot better on a
tablet for reviewing photos while on the
go
it's called fewer this is Adaline from
pocket out and let's check it out so
usually the first thing I want to do
after a photo shoot is to flip through
all the pictures and start choosing the
ones they're good before I go editing
now here I am in Lightroom and again and
like I said that it's not touch friendly
at all
it's not even stylus friendly because
the scroll bars are on the left and now
I can't see anything it also took me
about a half hour to get all these
pictures into Lightroom 5 because it has
to import them into a database Bridge is
slightly better you don't have to import
them into a database so you can start
working with them right away and it also
has this nifty little review mode which
is pretty finger friendly you can see I
can flick through and flick the ones
that I don't like sometimes but you see
it's not terribly responsive so check
out this app here's viewer and from here
you can add folders so you can choose
which folder you want to look at there's
the one I'm looking at and right here I
have my colored labels and my stars if I
turn on the Settings over here I can do
Auto advanced reading Auto advanced
color and so right now next one that's a
bit bad one bad one bad one this one's a
maybe I'll go next one that was pretty
good that was a three that was a maybe
once that very good mm-hmm
so really quickly just with one touch
I'm ranking all of these photos now this
app is adding metadata to these pictures
they're all raw files so that's the one
thing but it's adding metadata that is
going to be imported into Lightroom or
bridge or Corel after shot so I'm not
replacing Lightroom but I'm adding
something to the workflow that works
really well on tablet for your first
initial ranking and reviewing process
now you can see this is very quick
here's something else I can show the
keyword listing and I can add a keyword
so let's say crop this so now I've added
a keyword to this photo you can see it
listed right down there tiny little word
and we can add as many keywords as we
want so I'm gonna crop that one later
let's find some of the good ones and
this is a good one I'm going to crop
that and I'm also gonna retouch it so
let's add that as a keyword and I'm
gonna apply it so I have crop and
retouch listed there now okay so let's
go back to one of the other apps I have
a bridge and you see right away those
keywords show up right here so I can
select all the pictures that I want to
crop so say my desktop computer at home
I'm gonna use that for editing I can
really easily find the ones that I want
to crop I can find the ones that I want
to retouch there's the one that I marked
as retouch for keyword and I can find
all the high-ranking pictures really
quickly you're probably thinking yeah
that looks pretty fast for a expensive
surface pro 2 with a gigs of RAM and
whatnot about something cheaper like a
$200 Dell
Venue 8 Pro alright I'll show you how
that works
okay so here is a SD card I took out up
camera just camera right there and I'm
gonna plug it into the d√°il and then I'm
gonna launch fewer this is how it loads
and we gotta add a folder I'm gonna find
oh this is the one that I want so it's
going to show that folder and then I can
open it and you see how quickly it loads
all these so you can see I can rate all
of these really quickly and the data is
going right to my SD card over there so
when I get home I can just plug that as
d card into my main computer import
those into Lightroom and all of this
metadata is gonna be preserved we can
also show thumbnails of all the pictures
and you can see the rankings right there
next one as well as the labels and it's
the colored labels you see a little bit
of lag but we're talking about 750 raw
photos here and this is a Bay Trail Atom
processor with 2 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs
of storage with barely any free space
left so this is pretty high performance
for something that will quickly let you
flip through all your raw photos rank
them add keywords it's really really
nice for photographers on the go this is
