recognition features for both its
cameras Google pixel 2 and pixel Excel 2
leaked in some very credible case
renders an LG seems to have the solution
for killing off the dual display on the
V 30 I'm high net without and this is
one of those crazy cases for our quarter
video in one country edit over the
Caribbean Sea and then publish and
upload on another this is Park it out
daily the official news today begin with
funny stories believe it or not Honolulu
is one of the first cities in the United
States to ban your usage of smartphones
while you're walking it makes a lot of
sense I mean I have had crazy cases
where I run into people because they're
looking at their phone while they're
walking makes a lot of sense to avoid
jaywalking biggest problem is that I
rely a lot on using my phone for Google
Maps when I'm in cities like New York
for example so let's see how that goes
this was a spotlight over to Facebook we
have been covering the whole topic of a
modular phone with a speaker and for
those of you wondering what is Facebook
trying to do here apparently they're
building a video chat speaker and
honestly I don't really know if this is
going to be a good idea or not we've
seen Amazon try to do it this is
definitely trying to compete with Amazon
but my god Facebook just gets more
intrusive every single time let's see
how that goes
and how about if we talk about the LGBT
as one of the things we know is the
secondary display is probably not going
to make the cut at least we notice it in
the rumors and for those of you
wondering what will L do you do
apparently there's going to be this
floating icon somewhere this floating
bar that will provide the functionality
which I'm not necessarily sure will be a
good idea given the fact that anyways I
didn't really use that secondary display
much but we'll see what the company ends
up pulling over time now let's talk
about the Google pixel Google pixel xl2
for those of you wondering what the
final designs would be well it seems
that there is a case maker that is so
confident that its renders are the final
ones that their cases are already on
pre-order you can actually ask for them
in the link in description they look
really cool
not just the cases the phones look
gorgeous hopefully these are the final
designs we should learn more about it
soon though this is
really early and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with the
iPhone 8 as the home pot firmware
continues to leak what this phone is
going to be able to do apparently the
back camera and probably even the selfie
camera will be able to detect things
like pets kids including scenes as well
and we know that Apple has been adding
this functionality to its photos
applications forever so now apparently
it's going to be able to do it in real
time
another thing is apparently their
biometric security feature with the iris
scanner or whatever 3d facial
recognition will have will be reliable
enough to be used for Apple pay so
hopefully that will be the case but the
question would be if you are willing to
give up the fingerprint scanner over
this because apparently it's not going
to make the cut in my case I wish we had
both options leave us a comment down
below and let us know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video is filmed but Louis I'll find out
a comment subscribe to our channel as
well for more videos like this one and
also follow me on twitter hein
underscoring that our Instagram and hina
be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
hanging the video thanks so much for
watching hopefully we'll see you
tomorrow 9 p.m. Eastern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
