developer edition of the latest version
of Android Android L but how does it
stack up against the version of Android
that you've got in your pocket I'm Joe
Levi with pocket now this is Android L
versus Android KitKat this is my Nexus 5
running the latest developer preview
version of Android L downloaded just
yesterday if you want to find out how
you can get this on your device make
sure you head over to pocketnow.com
we'll have the link down in the
description how you can get this under
your device this is my nexus 4 it's
running the latest version of KitKat
version 4.4.4 that's a lot of force so
how are they similar how are they
different well first of all it's very
very similar
a lot of the iconography is the same the
layout is the same widgets function just
the same app drawers function pretty
much the same but you'll notice right
away we've got different on-screen soft
buttons very different some people are
calling this up PlayStation look and
feel whereas this is the the more
traditional version that we've become
accustomed to folders on Android KitKat
are kind of offset and scrolled back
into the distance but once you open them
they look and feel just like a folder
complete with icons and a tile and a
label at the bottom folders over on
Android L well if you look they're still
stacked but they're kind of stacked all
straight in a row not offset and when
you open them up you still get kind of
the same look and feel the same grid of
icons in the same way to go in and edit
and change your label we can get our
notification bar on the top this is
where we get our notifications our
Bluetooth in this case I'm set to
vibrate mode Wi-Fi I don't have a sim in
the phone my battery and the current
time looking over at Android L you can
see we've got essentially the same thing
there's my notification icon Bluetooth
has a new icon see if we can get that a
little bit closer when you've got a
Bluetooth device connected their dots on
either side of the Bluetooth icon
vibrate looks a little bit different
than it did on Android KitKat Wi-Fi it's
a similar icon but there's a little bit
subtle differences in there my
connection here I'm connected to
t-mobile's LTE battery looks a little
bit different and the clock has that new
Roboto font that they just updated for
Android L coming back over to KitKat
when we pull down the notification shade
this is a very dark theme
it's the stock theme that comes with
every version of AOSP Android but very
very dark not a lot of lightness here
you can open and dismiss notifications
just by swiping you can dismiss them all
with the dismiss all button and then you
can toggle over here as well and get to
your quick toggles and into your
settings when we compare that to Android
L pull this down it's a little bit
lighter we still have the dark across
the top we have the time up at the top
but no longer the date as we did with
Android KitKat
a little bit new layout we've got our
picture over here rather than just a
generic icon saying that this is your
personalized stuff and then much more of
these these cards which is the material
design that we heard so much about at
Google i/o from here we can tap on your
little avatar or you can pull down again
so I'll show you that again here is that
and here is that to pull down to our
quick notification so a little bit
different way to get there it's a double
poll rather than a pull on the tap but
you can still get there just by tapping
settings is available quickly and easily
right there by tapping on the COG so
let's go into settings here you can see
my settings if I want to turn bluetooth
on or off I can do that I've got not
much of an animation at all on my
toggles the toggles are very Square and
blocky when they're finally turned on
the color changes to let you know what's
there you can see a very very light
theme much larger easier to read easier
to understand still kind of divided into
the same categories but overall you know
a refresh turning things on and off now
has a animated slide button toggle thing
I don't know exactly what you'd want to
call that but quite a bit different than
the square blocky switch that we had
before in
kitkat when you get to the top of a list
you get this nice subtle little glow at
the top it doesn't look like it's a
solid block it looks like more of a
gradient the same on the bottom also
when you tap things light up just
momentarily and it's the whole bar that
lights up see what that looks like on
Android L since this is a light theme
having a light wouldn't make sense so
they instead have this shadow it doesn't
look like there's any gradient we're
sure that that was done just because it
takes less processor especially GPU to
render a solid color with an animation
than it does to render a gradient with
an animation once we tap on something
you'll see the new ripple effect and
animations that they were talking about
that happened really fast
but if you can see where I tap kind of
ripples and spreads out so if I tap on
the side it recognized where that is and
it spreads out if i tap on that side it
spreads out from there again very fast
it's a subtle thing but it's it's
interesting then the less it also looks
like the first time you tap on something
it goes a little bit slower and the next
time you tap on something it goes a
little bit faster this is using the the
brand new Android runtime or art by
default and you can't change that back
based on what we can tell Android KitKat
comes with both but it comes with dalvik
set as the default next up is the new
recents menu tapping on that you get
your list you can dismiss things out of
it closing them and whatnot but it's
just a simple list that you can scroll
up and down in when we switch over to
Android L we get the new material or
card-based interface so we'll tap on
recents and you can see here a card
stack that's much more fluid much more
animated but it lets you do the same
thing you can swipe things off to the
side quickly easily just like that
the new boot animations over on Android
L has the the same Google colors but a
very different version than what they
have on Android KitKat
they both boot in approximately the same
time a little bit more animation a
little bit
there here's our lockscreen similar
information
unlike android kitkat which lets me
quick launch my camera just by swiping I
can do that over here as well but I can
also do the same thing with my dialer
down here in the bottom I can just swipe
right for my phone and then I have a
dialer right there in this case to make
an emergency call you'll also notice
that I have notifications that look a
lot nicer on the screen since I have a
screen lock in place it doesn't show me
the contents of what of what I'm seeing
in those notifications I can come and
swipe up nice animation there that
builds in and then I have the nice
ripple effect to login of course that's
not the pin that I have but hides your
information this is a little bit
frustrating because it's not as
convenient as otherwise but hopefully
once we have Android wear we won't need
to do that pin unlock because the phone
itself will be unlocked by the the
wearable on your wrist there are some of
the major differences and similarities
between Android L and Android KitKat if
you liked the video please give it a
thumbs up and make sure you subscribe to
our channel so you don't miss out on any
of our future coverage also we're on all
your favorite social media networks we
would love to interact with you over

L versus Android KitKat I'm Joe Levi
