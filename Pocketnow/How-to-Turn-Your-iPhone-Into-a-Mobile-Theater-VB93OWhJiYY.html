pocket now calm what we're looking at is
a smartphone in this case an iPhone
projecting a 52-inch screen onto this
wall
with a projector that can fit in your
pocket this video we're going to tell
you how to do it so there's a lot of
equipment here and it's not cheap this
is the optima pico projector it can run
30 lumens on battery power and 50 lumens
when it's plugged in in the back with
the DC power was that right yeah and I
mean that's pretty impressive for a
projector that is you know about the
size of your hand or smaller than the
size of your hand more expensive
projectors can do in the hundreds but
certainly they are not pocketable this
projector costs around $400 or so but
there are slightly cheaper ones
available so if you follow the wires
we'll go down and we'll go see the
iPhone here you have to have your iPhone
jailbroken for this to work do you need
a special app to get it to work yeah
something that says yeah the preferences
of the video out got it and also we've
got audio out here if you look closely
audio out going to these speakers that
work with bluetooth but they're just
connected with with the wire now so
we've got a kind of a mobile movie
solution here which is projecting we
turn off the light you'll see it a
little better
quite an impressively large screen onto
the wall certainly if we were to plug
this into the wall we would get an even
brighter picture but this looks pretty
darn good for sort of a makeshift little
theater we'll put links up on how to get
these products they are a little bit
expensive but hey this is pretty cool
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
