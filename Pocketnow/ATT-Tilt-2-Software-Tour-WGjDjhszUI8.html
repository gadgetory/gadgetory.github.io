pocket now calm and this is a software
tour of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two which is the
touch pro 2 variant on AT&amp;amp;T we're going
to take a look at how the software
differs from other devices that run the
touch pro 2 to kind of see how AT&amp;amp;T has
customized this device we know you've
seen the touch pro 2 in a million ways
so we're going to try to keep it to the
things that are unique to the AT&amp;amp;T tilt
two so let it start off in touch flo 3d
this is kind of the older version of
touchflo 3d that doesn't have the the
weather built into the clock here like
you would find on say the verizon imagio
we can go over to the right tab here
which is the people tab of course you
can add favorite people you can flick
through their pictures the next tab is
SMS you've seen this before the next one
is email the next one is something that
i would definitely remove this is where
all the AT&amp;amp;T proprietary stuff is stuff
that links only to their web and their
app store in their ringtone store you
can remove this tab i'll show you how in
a sec the next tab over is for the
internet tab and here you can have push
internet pages meaning if you check a
site every day at the same time you can
have it be ready and waiting for you at
a certain time so we can go to menu and
well actually we click here add a new
push page and it says it's going to use
data and we can say that we want
pocketnow.com and by the way the
keyboard on this device is among the
best that you can get on a smartphone
it's very wide it has offset keys so we
can set the frequency here to every six
hours every three hours let's say every
12 hours I want it to update I'm going
to put the title as P now and click Save
and let's go back into portrait and
there it is pocket now and it will load
every 12 hours let's see how it looks
while we're on the web browser tab we're
going to tap on pocket now kind of see
the performance of opera mobile 9.5 on
the tilt two
and here it comes through now you can
also use skyfire or opera mini five
which uses server-side rendering to pull
down pages faster opera mobile 9.5 is
more so of a full web browser that that
renders everything on your device so
here comes now and we can go into
landscape with the accelerometer or if
we flip open the keyboard will also go
into landscape okay here we go our
pocket now calm we can tap and drag to
go down the page performance on Opera
Mobile 9.5 is very good we've seen this
browser in a million different devices
and they all exhibit great performance
we can double tap the zoom in or we can
use this zoom bar on the right side and
so we drag our finger up to zoom in a
little bit and then we can pan around
further double tap to zoom in and it
fits the column double tap to zoom out
we've seen this before an opera mobile
9.5 great performance on the tilt two
for the for the internets let's get out
of this okay moving on we've calendar
and you can view all of your calendar
stuff right in the screen so if we click
on today we get that nice animation we
can tap on new appointment from right
here although we're dumped back into the
standard windows mobile interface future
versions of touchflo 3d will actually
keep you in a nicer looking interface so
you can go to month view debut it's kind
of a nice way to sort of see all of your
appointments and not have to go into the
windows mobile calendar which doesn't
look as nice as this go into stocks tab
and we can click on any of these stocks
and get a chart and says tap here to
update data we've seen this before let's
go back photos and video and as with
opera mobile you can use the zoom bar to
zoom in on pictures so we can slide it
like so there it goes and it zooms in
zooms out you get the idea and then you
can flick I guess it's down because
we're supposed to be over here to go to
the next picture kind of like you get in
the iphone all right so let's get it
back into portrait and here we are in
music and of course you can flick
through your your album covers and play
music right from
your home screen here and we can go into
library to get the nice touch flo 3d
interface where you can look at albums
or different playlists that you may have
a very nice little music application
that you can access right from your home
screen we can go into whether and of
course see the weather in your area or
in multiple cities flick your finger up
you get the full forecast on the bottom
which is always a nice touch let's see
what settings we have so we can go into
sound and we can change you know the
ringer volume or the ringer type things
like that we really can't change this
big AT&amp;amp;T logo in the background we can
only change the wallpaper on the home
screen tab which is a little bit
annoying but you know 18d has to get
their their footprint in the device
certainly so right now I just changed
the background on the home screen but
all of the other ones still stay the
same in settings we can set up mail we
can sync data customize the tabs this is
where you would remove certain tabs that
you don't want and keep the ones that
you do and you can of course rearrange
them by tapping and holding the button
over here I want to click cancel and
over on the right is a program launcher
if you don't like the windows mobile 6.5
program launcher which by the way has
the new honeycomb interface then you can
access the program launcher through
touchflo 3d so let's go through and see
what programs come on the 18 d tilt to
actually first let's take a look at how
this works in landscape touchflo 3d
finally works in landscape if you had
the HTC fuze from AT&amp;amp;T you may remember
that there was no touchflo 3d in
landscape you just got a grid of icons
so now we have this little button here
that hides away all of the menu items
and we can kind of slide along from
there and everything kind of reflows
nicely for the lands landscape screen so
then we get the weather on the right
side instead of on the bottom and within
a few seconds this bar will hide away so
that you can see the full forecast and
there we go okay so let's put the
keyboard away screen rotation speed is
quite good very fast it's always been
fast on the touch pro 2 right now it
takes a little while longer to redraw
the screen because we're in a graphic
intensive area i'll show you how fast
screen rotation speed is in SE text
messaging where
speed really really counts okay so let's
go into the start menu and we can go
there by tapping on the windows flag or
just by going up here and we've got the
kind of four icon wide grid that we can
go through so let's see what we have
here calendar let's see what games are
included on this device a lot of
java-based trial where AT&amp;amp;T likes to put
this sort of software on the device such
as guitar hero for we can launch it but
it's going to say that it's only a trial
this one's saying that we need to be in
landscape mode so let's see if that
actually is true and then go to games
and go to guitar hero for and see what
happens let's help the screen a little
bit screen is great sensitivity very
close to being capacitive it is
resistive but it has a high level of
sensitivity let's see what we can do
here by full game yeah of course so
we're not gonna be able to do too much
with this i'm going to do career select
avatar can we flick scroll no press the
buttons okay be this guy okay select
guitar this one looks cool let's go easy
I don't know if that says okay and it
looks like you tap I'm not so good at
this game and I'm obviously planting it
wrong so it looks like you get some
trial where I'm definitely sure I want
to exit and if you want to use the full
version of course you'll have to buy the
game so let's go back into the start
menu and see what else we have their 18
nap navigator we have the App Center
which is a tease proprietary app store
although this device has the marketplace
for Windows Mobile which we're going to
go through in a second here's the camera
for the 3.2 megapixel camera on the back
which unfortunately doesn't have a flash
but as very good quality and we'll talk
about that soon let's go down to
settings and see kind of how much memory
we have and things like that we'll start
off and personal to see if there's
anything interesting here this device
comes with voice command you can specify
a keyboard sound if you want every time
you open the keyboard but that may annoy
the people around you so you may want to
keep that off
we can set a voice command hearing aid
compliance we can assign some of the
hardware buttons to launch programs such
as the send key when you hold or the
push to talk button which would probably
be a good idea because a lot of people
don't use push to talk anyhow so why not
have it open up say email with one click
that would be probably a good idea or
good use of that let's go into system
see how much memory we have right now
only 63 megabytes I've been opening a
lot of programs so presumably there are
several programs open after a soft reset
you have about 80 megabytes of free
program memory which is pretty good not
amazing if you disable touchflo 3d and
use the standard windows mobile today
screen interface you get back about 10
megabytes of RAM which may be important
for you standard stuff in here we can
calibrate the g sensor which will work
in Opera Mobile 9.5 in photos and some
other places you don't get screen
rotations in every screen although you
can always flip out the keyboard it has
a GPS Wi-Fi of course let's go back also
you see that as TV out if you have the
right cable you can do TV out connected
to a projector or to a flat panel it
will do output in its native resolution
so you're not going to get really high
quality video output but good enough for
a projector if you're giving a
presentation and let's go back to where
we came from we've pocket internet
explorer or as they call it now Internet
Explorer mobile if you want to use that
to view flash content because opera
mobile doesn't do flash internet
explorer mobile does we can go into the
marketplace and you've probably seen
this before the windows mobile or as
they call it the windows marketplace for
mobile is the App Store equivalent and
right now it doesn't have that many apps
it's kind of growing right now there are
about 250 apps but every day gets bigger
and bigger and the cool thing about this
is that when you pay for a nap you can
have it go on to your AT&amp;amp;T bill which is
different than the iphone where it's
always going through iTunes and your
account with them so it's a convenient
way to pay let's go back into the start
menu let's go to office mobile and take
a look
at screen rotation when you're typing so
we're going to make a new document here
and you get these great on-screen
keyboard options but I want to put that
away whoops and let's see how fast we
get a rotation pretty much instant which
is really what matters so that by the
time you get to landscape you're ready
to go and ready to type and the keyboard
is absolutely fantastic i'm going to
zoom out a little bit just do a little
test very very comfortable keyboard
probably one of the best that you can
get for a mobile device so I'm gonna
click OK and get out of that all right
so let's go back in the start menu see
what else we have in here oops didn't
mean to do that we have album which is
HTC's photo album you can organize by
folders you can drill into different
pictures based on the folders you can
put all your videos in here and a lot of
this stuff is 18t stuff so App Center
18t music AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi AT&amp;amp;T Navigator so
stuff that you may want to clean up if
you want to go into file explorer and
reduce the amount of programs that are
in this screen actually i'll show you
how to do that real quick we need to get
to file explorer which can probably be
found in oh it's good they included the
facebook app by the way the file
explorer can probably be found in in
tools so let's go in there go to file
explorer and we're going to want to go
to the the windows directory so tap on
windows
and don't tell ATT i'm showing you how
to do this we're going to want to go
down to the start menu and the programs
and let's say I'm going to get rid of
AT&amp;amp;T music I know I'm never going to use
it I'm going to tap and hold on it and
whoops let me go back up I miss that
here it is delete yes I want to remove
that and all of its contents yes 20 and
80 music should be gone and yes it is so
cleaned up the start menu a little bit
so I get get it down to the programs
that I'm going to use on a regular basis
so overall no big surprises in terms of
software on 18t tilt two we're really
confident that anyone upgrading from the
AT&amp;amp;T tilt or the HTC fuze is going to be
very very happy with this device the
touchscreen is extremely sensitive the
keyboard is fantastic with nice fast
screen rotations and now you get windows
mobile 6.5 which means you can get the
app store widget support and its overall
a little bit faster than you would get
on the same device running windows
mobile 6.1 awesome upgrade to some
devices that really held the bar high
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
