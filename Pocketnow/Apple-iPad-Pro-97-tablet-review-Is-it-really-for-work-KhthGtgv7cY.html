medium-sized iPad and now we need to
take a look at who might benefit from
upgrading to this tablet powerhouse I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for Pocket now and
here's our review of the nine point
seven inch iPad pro there's just not a
lot of mystery in reviewing an iPad
after successive generations years of
refinement and the addition of a new pro
line of these tablets are well
understood
if you've ever held an iPad air the 9.7
inch pro will feel familiar this is an
expertly manufactured slate which is
shockingly light unlike the big brother
prone I'm point 7 seems like a handy er
companion for folks on the go the screen
a very happy balance between
productivity and portability Apple
doesn't sell specs as much as they craft
and experience but quickly talking
hardware we do have a Retina display on
the front face resolution of 2048 by
1536 powered by an a 9 X processor in
two gigabytes of RAM we're reviewing the
Wi-Fi only base model unit with 32
gigabytes of storage which rings up for
599 dollars and we'll also check out the
Apple pencil which retails for $99 we've
detailed the core iOS experience in
previous videos so we're really focusing
more on what's new this year over the
iPad air and the larger pro while the
design is nearly identical the smaller
pro isn't just a recycle of the air with
stylus support more powerful internals
will always be appreciated but the
display is an obvious area where Apple
made an effort to differentiate this
tablet from previous offerings this is a
terrific LCD great viewing angles good
outdoor readability and excellent color
saturation new for this year true tone
automatically adjusts the display color
to account for light in your environment
this works surprisingly well and it's a
shock seeing the display with this
feature disabled I'm not sure how this
will affect artists or folks who depend
on professional-grade color accuracy but
it's a terrific feature for consuming
content audio playback is similarly
spruced up over the iPad air moving from
bottom firing stereo speakers to the new
quad speaker array there's no
orientation you can hold this tablet
where you won't get solid audio
reproduction
improved over both the air and the
larger Pro Apple includes the front and
rear cameras found on the iPhone 6s the
rear camera offering 12 megapixel stills
UHD video recording in 240 frames per
second slow motion the tablets are
ridiculous Photography devices but if
you ever do need to shoot a photo or
video from a slate you might as well
have the best camera that company has to
offer right one minor gripe the camera
module does bulb from the rear casing
causing a bit of a wobble when the pro
is on a flat surface but you'll probably
be keeping this thing in some kind of
case anyway the iPad pro also inherits
the FaceTime camera from the iPhone 6s
getting a bump up to 5 megapixels but
unfortunately video stays capped at 720p
with a brighter screen and a more
powerful processor we're happy to see
that battery life remains impressively
long-lived on a media test streaming one
hour of HD video over Wi-Fi at 50
percent brightness the Petite Pro
drained 8 percent of its battery this
kind of playback will easily outlast
Apple's estimate of 10 hours of use on
Wi-Fi this battery is pretty big but can
be recharged from completely dead in
around three hours one hour on the
included charger topped off 34% we're
not the first nor will we be the last to
point out that for a company which has
derided the stylus in the past the Apple
pencil is a fluid and precise fine point
control for the iPad I don't draw like I
used to as a kid and others will make
far better use of this than I can but
this is a delightful tool to utilize is
it worth $99 on top of the price of an
iPad pro only the individual shopping
for one can answer that question and our
criticisms regarding storage still stand
it's the users responsibility to find a
solution for keeping track of it and it
looks a little silly charging from the
Lightning port but we can't fault the
actual operation as mentioned at the top
of this video a lot of this is well
understood commentary when talking iPads
Apple is on a mission to convert more
folks over to iOS morphing this platform
from iPhones and content consumption to
creating content and getting work
as this is only the second device in
Apple's lineup to embrace this
philosophy we're still at the beginning
stages of this experiment we can't
really find fault with the hardware but
software is where we witness some
teething pains iOS as an environment
still doesn't quite lend itself to
professional use happily iOS supports
multitasking split-screen apps though
the process of selecting two apps to
have on screen requires a bit of hunting
the thing about professional computing
though a major aspect of how pros work
is in their ability to organize their
own unique workflow my PC is an absolute
mess but it's my mess I know where
everything is
iOS as a platform is a little more
restrictive in how you can organize apps
files and manage data moving between
programs so for this review instead of
just giving you a couple minutes of me
holding the tablet and poking at it with
a stylus I wanted to see how far I could
push this tablet I produce YouTube
videos for a living so would I be able
to produce an iPad pro review on an iPad
pro starting with writing the script
absolutely a joy this is an easy slate
to use for writing I live out of
Microsoft Word and while we don't have a
pro keyboard to review with this iPad my
little Bluetooth folding keyboard works
great that's easily covered recording
the voiceover for this video while
reading that script totally easy
I use a Sennheiser lavalier microphone
which plugs directly into the iPads
lightning connector and the vo for this
review was all recorded from that setup
in my office the audio quality is great
but using the apogee recording app
created a little storage bucket which
wouldn't share files with any other apps
directly on the iPad
I couldn't import directly into iMovie
nor could I get GarageBand to find these
audio files so I had to upload them to a
cloud location then redownload them back
into the project I was working on this
is obviously not ideal but we were able
to do it shooting on my Samsung
mirrorless camera transferring videos
over Wi-Fi was simple enough and iMovie
was perfectly able to import those files
unfortunately there are no options for
adding a soundtrack in addition to a
voiceover track so back we went to
GarageBand to premix the audio track
which was then re-import ydynt ooh
imovie moving files around importing
clips and cutting up sequences
we actually created a solid little
timeline for what could have been this
review minor gripe the camera module
does bolt from the rear casing causing a
bit of a wobble wind but getting to the
end of this process iMovie has no
options for rendering only delivering a
30 frame per second 1080p not a 60 frame
per second video that these clips were
shot in there also doesn't seem to be a
way to slap on a persistent watermark
someone drop us a comment if there's a
way to do this in iMovie but we couldn't
find one and for all the work in putting
this together the last finishing touches
for this review still had to be wrapped
up on a proper computer we got closer
than I thought we'd be able to and all I
had to do was fundamentally change the
way I organize files and the order in
which I edit pieces together from my
normal workflow but that's where we keep
ending up with mobile gear your mileage
will certainly vary document management
for example is terrific now but the iPad
pro is honestly overkill for folks
working in Word and Excel maybe art and
graphics professionals can make it
farther through their workflow but I'm
an audio and video producer so that's
the criteria by which I would judge a
pro product and this slate would really
benefit from a robust app version of
final cut or premiere which more closely
resembled desktop versions of those
programs so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the iPad pro
nine point seven there are many folks
out there criticizing the price as too
high over the previous starting price
for the iPad air 2 I think we see enough
improvements to warrant the higher cost
storage increases camera improvements
processor upgrade screen improvements
better audio and the same great battery
life outfitting and accessorizing this
tablet though brings us into laptop
price territory and this is where we're
unsure if the iPad pro can really
satisfy the claims made by calling this
a pro product to be sure this is the
nicest mobile processor tablet I've ever
used we've got the horsepower we just
need the apps now and some improvements
to aspects like file management and
organization would certainly help
improve the professional reputation for
this product until then the iPad pro is
still just going to be a companion
device for our laptops and

now I'm Juan Carlos bag now you can chat
me up on Twitter and Instagram as some
gadget guide and I will catch you all on
the next review

firing stereo speakers to the new quad
