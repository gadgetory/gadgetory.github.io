software updates to expect from Korea
Samsung pretty much confirms its next
round SmartWatch and you'd be amazed at
how many companies ones up I know he is
here maps I'm hi Mary vetta and if you
can't beat them then do what I do join
them by inviting them to a drink this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with algae as the company
has made the watch urbane official and
yeah in time for the Apple watch we know
the company is launching it as of this
weekend Korea starting with that and
then it'll move to other important
markets like North America and Europe
now the price points have not been
provided just yet because apparently
it'll vary significantly depending on
markets but yea even the google play
store will have it stay tuned for that
and let's continue with LG we love the
fact that this company does not like
rumors they make things official and so
have they made official all the camera
features that you're getting on the g4
at least some of them the coolest ones
are the fact that for example now you
don't really have to turn on the camera
at all or the phone at all to take a
photo all you do is look at whatever you
want to take a photo up double tap the
bottom button of the navigation keys and
you've got a photo in addition to other
selfie tricks for you to get bill
selfies right and other stuff that's in
the links of the description for a full
video now let's talk about Samson we
have been talking about the samsung gear
a for the longest time or at least
that's what we expect to be the codename
for its round SmartWatch and now they
publish the new SDK and the teaser for
developers is a round display and this
is the new gear experience as it should
be and they're looking for more
developers etc etc so yeah we're getting
around SmartWatch and even though we
don't have any dates we could speculate
that the fact that it's pointing to a
number 11 could be that hey May eleventh
probably up next we've got up oh we have
been following the Oppo r7 for the
longest time mainly because even though
the r5 was the thinnest smartphone for a
short-lived period of time and it did
great in our review the r7 does away
with bezels completely the lease have
been great we've seen videos we've got a
lot of stills of this phone it looks
great and
the rumors are that there is an event on
May twentieth where we might have the r7
already and given the fact that the r5
was just announced in September last
year wow that's fast and finally for the
very hot news of the day let's talk
about nokia the remainder nokia from
finland by the way we've heard that the
company wants to sell its here maps
service for reasons we don't understand
and the reports claim that we've got
three companies interested in buying it
including Facebook Amazon Apple and it
seems that the list goes on we just
don't have any other names and this is
very interesting we know that Apple
desperately needs a better mapping
service we're just not sure that here
maps would be the case we thought that
probably Microsoft would be interested
but it does lead me to the question of
the day what is your favorite navigation
service or mapping service for that
matter which is the one that you use
most in my case it really depends on
where I am if I'm in the US or Europe it
will be google maps but if I'm in Latin
America ways is the way to go not just
because of navigation buzz because of
the traffic services that it provides
it's really cool leave us a comment down
below what is your case friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is finishing
follow what I'm talking about comment
subscribe to channel as well you follow
me on Twitter Highlanders quarterly
better please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I am hi I'm
every better thank you very much for
watching we'll see tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
