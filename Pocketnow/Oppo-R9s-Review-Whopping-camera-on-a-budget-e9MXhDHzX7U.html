of what oppa has done in the Android
space it's always great to go back and
remember the reasons why I'm here to be
better with pocket now this is our
review of the Opel r9 s Oppo has spent
the last few years leaving a significant
dent in the smartphone market and a lot
of it has to do with the quality of its
products the companies our lineup was
always meant to defy the odds of
smartphone design and in the case of the
r9 s some of this legacy made it some of
it didn't actually
for starters we don't blame you for
confusing this device with a fruity
competitor the aluminium back embezzled
fronts are clearly inspired elsewhere
but there aren't design elements that
Opel improves like for example I really
love this six-string antenna line
pattern which I feel actually
complements design and every OEM should
follow and hey if you've ever wanted to
have an iPhone with an AMOLED display
you're actually looking at it we've got
a gorgeous 5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED display
with punchy color and deep blacks the
front fingerprint scanner is also very
responsive than Oppo includes capacitive
navigation keys to not steal from your
screen real estate internally this is a
premium mid-range er we've got a
Snapdragon six-to-five processor 4 gigs
of ram and 64 gigs of expandable storage
there are dual sim capabilities if you'd
like to skip on the microSD card and the
30 10 milliamp hour battery that has
proven to last more than the day of
average use although has also included
luke rapid charging technology with this
device which far over takes almost every
competitor in charging speeds trust me I
love it
powering the show is colour OS version 3
which is now based on Android 6.0
marshmallow sure we are a full version
of Android blade but you have to keep in
mind that the OS looks nothing like
Android that's the way colour OS has
always been iconography navigation menus
the lack of an app tray and even
notifications all resemble the look and
the feel of how iOS behaves I know for
some of you this is bad but I've got to
hand it to opal for how responsive this
user interface is
even for a premium mid-range er then
there are the few tricks that I really
love about oboes UI that make a comeback
in this device like for example being
able to encrypt applications to unlock
them with your fingerprint something
that not every om practices and some
other features like the gestures to
launch the camera when the phone is
locked or launched a flashlight which
are quite useful and speaking of the
camera we've actually got a decent combo
here of two 16 megapixel shooters the
primary including F 1.7 aperture phase
detection autofocus and pixels on the
sensor of 1.12 microns the results are
actually very good Oh coat out so the
camera on this phone is great and I will
admit that for a premium mid-range err
this is probably one of the best that
I've seen I'd probably suggest turning
off HDR at night given how slow the
camera can be but even in low-light
scenarios this camera is surprisingly
good
the selfie shooter is also 16 megapixels
2 aperture and I've got to say I'm quite
impressed with the results not the only
thing that I don't like about this
camera is how it performs on video
notice that there is some stabilization
being provided through software I
believe but it's not good enough for
walking around for example
overall the Oppo r9s is a decent package
for a premium mid-range er we're talking
great design a very good camera and then
approach to Android that I would say
would help any iPhone switcher feel
right at home I'd call the price a
little steep given how competitors like
the one plus 3t are very closer for this
range but if you're looking for an
Android phone that looks and behaves
like an iPhone
there is really no better place to go
honestly the Oppo r9 s is a very good
phone folks just like this we've got
