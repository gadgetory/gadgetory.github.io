pocketnow.com we've got a really
exciting unboxing for you today it's the
Acer Iconia Tab a 700 this is the first
high resolution Android tablet to come
to market
Asus is working on one Samsung's
probably working on one and everyone
else but Easter has beat everyone to the
punch with the a 700 let me give you a
little bit of background Android tablets
historically have had a resolution of
about 1024 by 768 or more commonly and
more recently 1280 by 800 the iconians
have a 700 goes beyond even 1080p which
would be 1920 by 800 and it goes all the
way to 1920 by 1200 these 24 inch
monitors behind me have a 1920 by 1200
resolution which is pretty high res so
to put that on a 10 inch tablet it's
going to be really impressive you're
going to get super crisp text and
graphics not nearly as good as the iPads
Retina display which goes all the way to
about 24 hundred by I think it's 1600 or
1500 or so but still quite impressive
for an Android tablet we've also got a
Tegra 3 in the air quad core and one gig
of ram and of course that's running Ice
Cream Sandwich Android 4.0 no honeycomb
here so this should be an awesome
awesome android tablet perhaps the best
yet so let's get to the unboxing of the
a 700
okay here it is let's look at the box it
says full HD although it should say
greater than HD because 1920 by 1200 is
really high-res again not as high
resolute and display on the iPad 3 but
this is leaps and bounds beyond anything
available for Android right now it's
turning over I look at some of the specs
over here so we've got Android the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 CPU running at I believe
it's 1.3 gigahertz have to check on that
we've also got 32 gigs of memory which
is which is great and gig of ram there's
that W uxga if you're trying to be
technical 10.1 inch LCD panel 5
megapixel camera on the back 1 megapixel
on the front GPS Bluetooth 2.1
and so on and so forth 98 hundred
million power battery so this should
have pretty good battery life so let's
bust open this case here this plastic
here we aren't also interesting to note
netflix logo which might mean that this
can do 1080p Netflix which would be
super cool usually at 720p if you're
using a Netflix app on say honeycomb or
other Ice Cream Sandwich tab so let's
pop this open and see what we have
inside Wow big piece of instructional
now this is a little bit thicker and
heavier than say the transformer prime
but that's going to happen when you add
say a quad-core know that Prime has
quad-core but definitely a higher is
screen I'm not even gonna look at what's
in here probably some accessories I just
want to see what this screen looks like
when turned on steel crisp icons are
I've never seen androids in 1920 by 1200
resolution okay so it's pretty pretty
thick actually it's about 10 millimeters
thick and you definitely feel it it's
also kind of hefty but definitely
lighter than say the iPad 3 so we've got
that fleece do you logo let's look
around quickly
we've got micro USB which is nice
speakers should be plenty loud got a
power headphones
back over there something I've no idea
what that is some sort of lock probably
for screen rotation and a microphone
let's turn this on I just want to see
the quality of the screen right off the
bat so let's turn it on right needs a
little bit of a charge but they usually
ship with a little bit better life
so okay we're back and here we are we
are in Ice Cream Sandwich here with kind
of a light skin from Acer but nothing
too heavy and I've gotten close and
looked at the icons and I can say that
things are quite crisp and clear I
haven't seen Android like this on a
tablet everything looks super sharp I
can barely see pixels I can't if I look
very closely but this is certainly a
huge improvement over the 1280 by 800
Android tablets that are out there and
things seemed to be pretty snappy real
quick let's just jump into the web
browser already connected over Wi-Fi
just want to go to a website and see
what performance is like kind of at
first we've got a vibration and we've
got a kind of annoying sound gonna shut
that off for the keyboard see what
performance is like let's go to the
desktop site
well it's loading with screen rotation
speed is like and it kind of took a sec
there to spend some time with this to
really get a sense that the performance
hopefully it's great with the Tegra 3
scroll down no checkerboard so far
that's good let's do some pinch to zoom
action took a sec to clear up but the
text just looks super sharp if you go
all the way in bring the camera all the
way up you really can't see pixels I
mean it's great to see Android it's such
a high resolution display here so we've
got a lot more coming up on the Acer
Iconia Tab a 700 great to see Ice Cream
Sandwich tablet running such a high
resolution display and quad core at that
if you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and there's my thumb and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
