now calm and in this video we're going
to give you a hardware overview of the
sony ericsson x10 mini android device
you've already seen our unboxing video
in our first software video so let's go
ahead and just get this one going and we
are back we're going to go ahead and
jump right into the hardware and the
form factor of this device right off the
bat as you can see here the Xperia x10
mini is a very small device comes in
weighing at three point 11 ounces so
it's small and light it actually has a
2.5 inch diagonal measurement screen
that sports a 240 x 320 resolution so
it's not the greatest resolution as you
can pretty much just tell by those specs
right there however it does the job and
I will go into these screen quality very
soon the processor on this device is a
600 megahertz processor again it's not
the fastest on the market right now but
for what sony has running as far as a
skin it actually will run that no
problem whatsoever I've noticed a pretty
good speed the onboard memory for
installing the applications saving music
that sort of thing is 159 megabytes it's
a very different number not what you
would typically see on most phones but
it's it's definitely there for you for I
would say for mostly installing the apps
you can install a micro SD card however
it's only up to a 16 gigabyte I'm not
sure why that is that's one of the
limitations that Sony has placed on the
device itself now on the sony x10 mini
we have three hardware buttons the first
button on the left is going to be your
menu key the middle button is going to
be your home button followed by your
back button on the far right looking at
the device up close and personal on the
bottom here we have your charging
portions a micro USB it is a rubber plug
type design so you have to actually pick
up this with a nail and actually move
the plug out of the way to be able to
charge it also has a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack of course that does fit
the special Sony headphone but as well
as any other headphone itself moving on
to the right side of the device we have
an actual camera button followed by your
volume rockers up and down the top will
just give you the lock and power key as
you can see here
and the left side of the device has
nothing on it at all now the back of the
device is going to give you the camera
with its LED flash it is a 5 megapixel
camera so it takes fairly decent quality
pictures as you can see we have the nice
sony ericsson logo here as well as the
xperia here is your speaker which
honestly is extremely loud when playing
music I will actually play a video in
the software overview part 2 video and
you'll hear how actually how loud the
speaker gets and how good the quality
stays I don't want to play any music
that's already pre-loaded on the devices
for copyright concerns now one element
of this device that may be up in the air
as far as your opinion goes is that the
x10 minis battery is non-removable now
the way you actually get to the battery
or get to the the back of the phone
let's say is you actually just take a
nail you stick it in this back cover
here pry it which is a little weird
there's no actual little spot for it but
hey it is what it is as you can see here
we have the black back cover which if
you saw my unboxing video they give you
interchangeable covers so going to give
you the green the black down the black
has a nice soft touch feel to it that's
why I like it they're also going to give
you a few more colors and basically all
you do is you just snap these on its
like you with the black cover and you
have a different unique looking phone
but going back to the actual back of
this device itself as you can see here
we have the slot for the memory card
which we have a 2 gigabyte card in right
now that's actually what comes in the
phone you have a slot for your SIM card
and once again that battery is not
removable so it's a very self-contained
unit you know call what you may I think
it's actually a little bit better that
the battery in this case will stay in
the device because that probably helped
to keep the form factor down is a very
small device so if you're looking for a
tiny device this is a very good answer
for that now I talked about the screen
resolution before how it's a little bit
lower quality than most screens at the
240 x 320 I'm going to try and give you
a closer look it's going to be very hard
to tell it's not exactly the sharpest
screen let's say so for example if we go
I don't want to really show you the
applications that i haven't showed you
yet cuz that's going to be coming in my
next video but if we look at for example
this picture here in the gallery you're
going to see that it's a little little
washed out only because the resolution
isn't where many of the other phones
that we see today are and last but not
least we want to give you a look
at the outdoor performance of this foam
that's one of the main things that like
to show off in our videos oh hi other
screens perform outdoors and this is a
typical LCD type screen the lower
resolution so we'll see how it performs
outside and let's go ahead and actually
jump right to that right now alright so
we've gone ahead and moved outside and
as you can see is a nice bright hot day
now I'm holding the phone in my hand so
I apologize for the shakiness I did want
to hold that the angle i would typically
hold a phone at just to show you how it
actually looks so as you can see here we
have the home screen clock if I swipe up
here to actually get to the icon menu I
personally can see this without an issue
whatsoever I hope the camera really
picks it up here by going to some of my
emails like I should check my inbox now
this isn't the actual gmail application
so it's not really seeing it you know as
great but for example if I click on an
email here it will now actually show me
the text itself so I really hope this is
given doing it justice I can see this
extremely well and i would say part of
that is probably the size of the screen
there is less surface area for glare and
i have no problem seeing that at all and
that has been our hardware review of the
sony ericsson x10 mini if you like what
you see so far you can actually pick up
this device right now over at clove co
uk for around three hundred twenty-five
dollars as always guys thank you very
much for watching please give us a
thumbs up and stay tuned for the final
two videos in this series of the sony
ericsson x10 mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
