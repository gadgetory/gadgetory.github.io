at its unpacked event the company teases
a new gear s2 for a launch at Aoife nhcc
shares details on its future job cuts
I'm high memory betta and trust me I did
everything I could to avoid this being
an impact version of the pocket out
daily pretty much everything today is
official but let's start with HTC and
some bad news we heard that the company
was working on job cuts but the company
has just come official to confirm that
it will be cutting fifteen percent of
its workforce now the company doesn't
specify what areas they will be doing
the job cuts or how this will affect
their smartphone lineup or any tablet
projects in the future we will be
looking into this sad news indeed our
official news come from LG the company
pretty much has just announced its new
LG music service and well this is just
what everybody's doing right now though
LG wants to do it a little differently
first of all they're looking for
affordable prices and the option to
offer high fine music for their specific
flagship devices that are detailed in
the legs of the description we should
learn more about the service soon
particularly how much they're going to
charge for it the hottest ticket of the
day is Samsung's unpacked event the
company has just announced two new
phablets the galaxy s6 edge+ and the
galaxy note 5 it comes to specifications
these devices resemble the galaxy s6 in
a lot particularly again design
specifications not even going to bore
you there are links of the scripture for
full details on what you're getting
there is no expandability options here
but there are some cool tricks that are
coming with these phones even keyboard
accessories as well Samson pay is also
going live in Korea on August twentieth
in the United States on September 18 and
if you're wondering what the whole deal
is for this what makes it hot in
comparison to Apple pay or Google Wallet
actually a lot you don't require NFC for
the service to work part of luke pays
acquisition is the fact that it allows
Sam's link to be able to sort of like
not necessarily swipe your phone but if
there's a credit card POS system where
you could just swipe a credit card it
would pretty much sum
worked your Samsung smartphone in ways
we really want to test we will keep you
posted and finally for the even hotter
teaser of the day Samsung used its
unpacked event to tease its gear s2
which is the Orbis or the gear a
whichever one you want to call it this
is pretty much the same SmartWatch now
we were covering rumors yesterday that
there are three models the s-1 vs 2 and
the s classic meaning that there will
apparently be different tiers for prices
and everything now the teasers don't
really show us the most premium
SmartWatch we've ever seen so we are
really really looking forward to see we
find that Eva s that's the event when it
will be announced but it does lead me to
the question of the day what do you
think was the hottest announcement today
be it the galaxy s6 edge+ I hate that
name of the galaxy note 5 or the gear s2
what is it that you are looking forward
to the most because in my case 64 gig
galaxy note 5 that's pretty much me but
