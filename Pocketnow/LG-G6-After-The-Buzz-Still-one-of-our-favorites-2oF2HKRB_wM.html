story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the bus behind that new tool you
might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as in point as the moment you unbox
your product for the first time it's how
that device performs after extensive use
that really matters down the line so
let's do something about it let's have a
second look at one of our favorite
smartphones of 2017 and see if it's
worth all the deals that are currently
going live I'm high net away that I
would pocket now and this is the LG G 6
after the buzz
you know I see the market reaction to
the LGG 6 and it really makes me sad I
find that so unfair that one of the best
phones that I've ever used gets so
little credit for all its innovation
sure like every product this one is not
perfect but this device actually gets a
ton of things right over time the
hardware has really a tres valley for my
time with the prototype 2 when I switch
to a final review unit I've stuck to
platinum variants and this would be the
color that I'd still recommend most if
the finish is scratched or not you
simply can't tell and fingerprints are
not a problem the silver finish on the
sides is intact save for a few battle
scars from a drop on to rocks where I
was able to prove that the milspec 810g
is no joke I sadly had to switch to a
black model recently and I still don't
know how I broke the Sentry with the
platinum variant and take my advice
don't force this in tray out if it
breaks as the unit no longer detects
anything if you yank it out the black
unit is definitely a fingerprint magnet
and even if the scratches aren't easily
noticeable you can definitely see them
as the back reflects light the grippy
feel I love during my review period is
still here so much so that I haven't
felt the need to use a case and that's
mainly because this phone is not
slippery at all now while I do like the
full vision IPS LCD for its color
accuracy one of my pet peeves with using
this phone is how long it takes to fully
light up it's like this odd split second
for it to fully adapt and it doesn't
really matter if I have automatic
brightness or not and then there's the
case for how software blends with taller
displays I'm totally for the concept and
I definitely think that this is the
future but notice I'm saying future
sadly at the moment applications haven't
really adapted so it just defeats the
purpose to have a taller screen with
minor bezels if the bezels are still
going to be shown by the software
sure LG's user interface was built
around the concept but proprietary
software does have its caveats this
continues to be one of my least favorite
you is given its aesthetics and it seems
like if it's here for the long run I
mean it's been five months since we
reviewed the g6
and only two software updates have been
launched and all these still have the
phone stuck on Android 7.0 at the time
of my review my only complaint with the
d6 were really solved with software
updates but well they're still not here
my battery life complaints would have
all been solved with the optimizations
of Android 7.1 - and sadly I'm still
barely scratching a day of moderate to
heavy use something sad considering that
this phone has a larger battery than
most competitors in its category and
then there's the problem of the whole
selling point of a toddler display which
was improve one-handed use and the
software just doesn't have any reach
ability options I we currently see with
iPhones and galaxies again all things
software could have improved so if the
hardware is so good and the software so
hit or miss you're probably asking just
why I can't leave home without a g6 and
the short answer is the camera I'm going
to admit something even if I'm reviewing
another phone I always carry a d6 in my
backpack and I mean always like
seriously never has a phone ridicule the
point issued camera more for me than the
LG G 6 and it's not just because of the
quality of its photos but because of the
versatility of the secondary wide-angle
lens if you're in New York City you
simply can't tell the whole story
without one end of your and places like
the Vatican Museum for example go wide
avoid the need to walk back and compose
your shot and then LG's post-processing
handles detail and streets better than
I've ever seen on another smartphone and
even if colors are sometimes
oversaturated they don't really go
overboard for my taste
even in video the secondary lens is just
so convenient to avoid the natural crop
the phone cameras bring I started
vlogging more lately and the d6 is
definitely my phone a choice again all
because of its versatility if anything
I'll complain about the selfie camera
because it does tend to be washed out
and terrible in low-light but I have to
admit that the wide-angle option still
makes this phone compelling to use even
for selfies overall the LG G 6 is a
phone that I finds it hard not to
recommend it's hardware is great and
Aegis very well and its camera should
seriously become an industry standard at
a time when most competitors are
fumbling with zoom lenses that I
honestly don't find that all convenient
I feel white angle is the way to go
I just wish LG would do a better job
with its software five months after its
release but our software is all it
stands between this phone and my
personal pics for perfection what I
still recommend the LG G 6 after the
buzz even with its minor shortcomings
absolutely and now that you can find
some crazy discounts for it all over
there is definitely no better time to
buy
