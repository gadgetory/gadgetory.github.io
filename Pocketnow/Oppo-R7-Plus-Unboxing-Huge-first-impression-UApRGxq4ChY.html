quality time with the Oppo r7 but the
biggest news were really about the
larger sibling the Oppo r7 plus that
wasn't ready back then and that just
arrived at our doorstep I'm high memory
that I would it now here with our
unboxing of the Oppo r7 plus even though
the Oppo our lineup is considered by
many to be a premium mid-range er
because of what you see on the spec
sheet I'll admit that I was rather
surprised with my experience of the Oppo
r7 I really had a lot of fun using it up
to the point where I still use it as my
daily driver but I have to admit the one
that I really wanted to give a try was
the r7 plus so there are many reasons
for me to be excited about this review
tearing down the DHL packaging we notice
a similar box to the Oppo r7 with
premium cardboard and details on
specification x' on the back OBO
continues to tone down its unboxings
here something I'm not much of a fan of
but hey what we really care about is
what's inside right now there's no way
to deny it this device is massive taking
up the entirety of the box and giving us
a pleasant surprise of a gold review
unit here we also notice that the box
contains the same accessories as with
the r7 being a sim ejector tool
literature a silicon case for the phone
a pair of basic headphones and a UK
edition of the boot rapid charger that
Oh rather large should charge your phone
in 30 minutes or less according to the
spec sheet
pulling the device from its plastic
coating I'll have to admit that my first
impression is very positive
this gold metallic finish actually
resembles rose gold depending on the
angle that you hold it from and it feels
very cool and premium to the touch
ovo claims a 92.3% metallic ratio here
and that's easily noticeable at first
glance the curved edges on the sides and
back and the 2.5 the glass only add to
the premium feel and even with this
humungous 6-inch display the 80% screen
to body ratio helps this device not feel
any larger than the average phablet you
might think that this is a bezel less
display due to the fact that you don't
see it when the display is turned off
but this is actually a very neat trick
that I'll be covering through our review
process going through the rest of the
accessories we've already discussed the
book rapid charging technology
extensively in previous reviews and
we've also talked about these headphones
probably the coolest thing is this
silicone case I'm not a fan of cases but
this one is really slim and doesn't add
any bulk to the phone once you added and
this texture inside the case also makes
it actually look really cool once you
place it so I highly recommend you give
it a try overall this is what unboxings
are all about a very elegant device
tucked into a neat box and coupled with
enough accessories to not make you want
to run to a store to buy any basics Oppo
never disappoints in this department but
keep in mind our review period is just
getting started we've got our first
impressions video where we'll cover
specifications and other details very
soon but we'd really love to hear what
