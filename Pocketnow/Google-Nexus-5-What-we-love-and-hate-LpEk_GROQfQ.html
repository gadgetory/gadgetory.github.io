and I do believe that if I dedicated the
last 60 episodes of the PocketNow daily
to this phone I wouldn't be exaggerating
and it is a great phone there's a lot of
stuff to talk about but if you weren't
able to order this device I know that
you're still on the ropes trying to
decide if it's worth it to make the line
and actually wait to order this device
so you've come to the right place
I'm high memory data this is PocketNow
and these are the reasons why we love
the Nexus 5 and the reasons why we
believe that the Nexus 5 could be better
the first reason to love the Nexus 5 is
really the fact that it's a non
compromised powerhouse the Nexus lineup
has always been this mixed bag of either
great specification zon a non affordable
unlocked price tag or a very affordable
phone with not great specifications like
in the case of the Nexus for this device
brings us back to the time of the Nexus
1 we finally get a device that doesn't
envy anything from the current flagship
smartphones exceptionally one of the few
devices throughout the Snapdragon 800
processor in the United States two gigs
of ram a 5-inch 1080p display that's
apparently gorgeous we have an optical
stabilized camera with 8 megapixels
which we're really looking forward to
because photographs are Nexus devices
have always been terrible so overall the
first reason why you would buy the Nexus
5 is because really it's one of the best
smartphones in the market right now the
second reason to love the Nexus 5 is
that aside from the fact that it's a
powerful phone you also have Android
with no excuses meaning if you're
currently rocking a galaxy s3 I'm sure
you love the fact that Android 4.3 is
not available to your phone just yet and
if you're rocking an HTC device I'm sure
you love the fact that you have to wait
90 days to get Android 4.4 or in the
case of Nexus devices you don't really
have that problem the new versions of
Android are out and the Nexus devices
are the first ones to get it even the
Google Edition phones the HTC One and
galaxy s4 Sally don't have the look of
the Nexus lineup and when you think
about the fact that a Google edition
phone cost you $650 and then you have
the Nexus devices crossing you have as
much what is the real purpose of buying
any other phone if the Nexus 5 is
actually more powerful in these Google
Edition phones and that brings us to the
third reason why you would buy a Nexus 5
this is the most affordable flagship in
the market by far and my far think about
this if you want to buy an iPhone 5s
right now unlock 16 gigs it will cost
you 650 bucks plus tax and in the case
of the Nexus 5 you'll pay 350 dollars
for that same phone you know I'm not
kidding three hundred and fifty dollars
when you think about it you get a more
powerful phone you get all the
specification that you wanted this year
it's pretty much a future-proof phone
for the next two years and you only pay
350 dollars for the 16 gig model
there is really no compelling reason why
you would not buy this phone even if you
don't need it now fine let's took the
point not everything about any phone is
perfect and obviously there are things
about the Nexus 5 that could improve
even if you'll notice that most of these
things actually do not have to do with
the phone number one is availability and
distribution probably the biggest
problem is that if you want to get a
Nexus 5 right now you can't it's sold
out you can only invite on the Google
Play Store and unless you're in the
United States or in the countries that
are supported you really cannot get the
Nexus 5 and its really been the problem
with the Nexus lineup over the last
couple of years I have friends that
still do not know what the Nexus form or
the Galaxy Nexus work they have no clue
that this phone even existed and it
mainly has to do with the fact that this
phone is not really popularly
distributed like the galaxy s4 for
example a lot of people say that the
galaxy s4 is popular because of its
marketing and that's half true the
marketing is really worthless if the
phone is not available and in the case
of the galaxy s4 it's available on every
carrier in almost every country even in
countries where the iPhone is not being
sold yet so when you think about it the
marketing is great the availability is
also great and this is really what the
Nexus line up needs it needs to be
available everywhere and at this price
point there is no reason why it wouldn't
sell that brings us to the second
problem of this phone which is the
carrier subsidy model yes the Nexus
lineup has been historically subsidized
but only by t-mobile and at a very crazy
price tag yeah we did have a case with
Verizon but I'm not even gonna include
that and still just think about it you
get a $350 phone that should be free on
contract have you compared to the iPhone
5s which is a $650 phone that's $200 on
contract obviously the price differences
allow this to happen but that hasn't
historically happened
t-mobile charges a crazy amount of money
for this phone that was a different
t-mobile though but right now we're
hearing about Sprint's we're hearing
about other carriers but we still don't
know the pricey scheme just yet and
hopefully if carrier has smart enough
this could be the next big hit for them
if they were smart enough to sell this
phone for free and finally one of the
biggest reasons why we're disappointed
about this phone is really because of
their parent company Google yeah they're
not doing a really good job in marketing
their products they haven't done
historically if this were a galaxy phone
this would be the hottest thing on the
planet that's a price tag but sadly
Google doesn't do things the same way
they are not in the business of selling
phones and that's really unfortunate
because there is nothing low-key about
this device we didn't get an event we
didn't get anything was just announced
it was just put out there and fine yeah
we were judged the pre-orders this is a
blockbuster so far but we don't really
know how many units are actually
manufactured why did it sell out
initially so yeah this could be the
greatest opportunity in the hands of
Google right now and making Android
probably the next best thing and really
disrupting the market because of the Sur
price tag and these specifications and
sadly google has decided to go silent
and that's rather unfortunate and yet
there is one reason why we're mixed
about this phone I love the design of
this phone I love the LG g2 and I love
the fact that this phone looks a lot
like it but then we have other members
of the parkin a team that don't feel
that way a lot of people feel that the
design of this phone is uninspired that
it's too simplistic that it's too stale
and I have to agree with them in part
the design is definitely not the biggest
thing out there but then again the
iPhone is really just the slack Sony
phones are just the slab and yeah this
phone doesn't have any chrome around and
it doesn't look as elegant as the Nexus
for dinner as the Galaxy Nexus thin so
I'll give you that the design is
definitely mixed so that leads us to the
question of this video do you like the
design of the Nexus 5 is it really
inspiring to you again in my particular
case I really like this phone I like it
for so many reasons that I really don't
care about the design that much and I do
like the design in part obviously I have
to hold this phone first but leave us a
comment down below and let us know what
you love what you hate about this phone
and specifically if you like the design
