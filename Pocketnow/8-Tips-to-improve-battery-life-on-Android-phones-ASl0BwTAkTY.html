phones to run longer but every year they
get more powerful capable of doing more
stuff it's easy to overlook the fact
that battery technology and capacity has
been steadily improving for every little
battery bump we get though we also get
more powerful processors brighter higher
resolution screens and once you get used
to a larger battery your app to just use
your phone more aggressively throughout
the day we're in a constant battle
balancing convenience against runtime so
with that in mind here are eight tips to
help prolong your phone's battery but
some of them you might not want to do
number eight set a shorter screen
timeout now this can be annoying when
reading through a longer section of text
but the longer your screen stays fully
lit the faster your battery drains
it's shocking the number of people
you'll meet who look at a notification
and then just set their phone down
without turning off the screen
five minutes later the phone takes care
that for them but that was four minutes
and 53 seconds of unnecessary power
drain those savages hit your display
settings and whittle down that time
until it's just mildly infuriating
number seven keep the screen brightness
low auto brightness is convenient but
often you can push the brightness a bit
lower and still actually see stuff on
your display on some phones you can
toggle auto brightness from the
notification shade but others require a
trip to the settings menu again we want
to find that razor's edge balance
between frustratingly unusable and
barely tolerable but every NIT of
display output hits your battery harder
number six
swap a fancy wallpaper for basic black
sure you've got this big beautiful
screen but what benefit does an animated
wallpaper really provide you that's
right shorter battery life switching to
a static wallpaper should take a little
power pressure off of your phone and if
your handset uses an AMOLED display
switching to a dark theme or at least
using a black wallpaper should help
reduce the amount of power draw from
lighting up unnecessary pixels don't
think of it as boring and plain think of
it as simple clean and efficient number
five curb background data it's pretty
nifty how our phones pull all this
information from the internet for us
even when we're not looking at
zaps but if we want to maximize runtime
we gotta put a stop to that you can be
really draconian and kill all background
usage or you can root out and curb the
most offending apps regardless I pretty
much always shut down Facebook because
it's Facebook number for disable Wi-Fi
NFC GPS and Bluetooth while you're
managing your cell data usage you can
also cut out all of your other wireless
radios and receivers again these are on
is a convenience get in your car and GPS
is already on in range of a hotspot
Wi-Fi will auto connect but these still
draw power when you aren't using them so
brush them off of course there are ways
to smart toggle some of this behavior
some phones will switch items on based
on location or Wi-Fi network and though
they never became super popular you can
always try out some of those nifty NFC
tags program the tags switch things on
and off as you tap and go about your day
but really most folks will probably just
grumble about having to do this stuff
manually until they give up and just
take the battery hit for having these
radios on all the time we know you're
lazy
number three disable app auto updates
this one actually burned me at a
baseball game where my phone found some
carrier branded Wi-Fi and then went to
town updating a bunch of apps
I noticed the phone was running warm and
yo I lost a small chunk of my battery to
a convenience setting hit up Google Play
and shut that down number two do you
really need haptic feedback no no you
don't it is fun getting little pulses
and vibrations from your phone but that
haptic feedback comes from a tiny little
motor that steals from your battery okay
turning it off probably won't extend
your battery life that much but every
little bit helps right and number one
use those battery saving features we've
got doze we've got power savers we've
got resources folks use them maybe you
aren't disciplined enough to manually
handle all of these battery saving tips
and you just need a broad sort of a
setting to hack at your phone's options
for you chances are pretty good that
your phone has some kind of mode which
will auto magically kill performance and
screen brightness when your battery gets
low well why wait just turn that on now
and reap the benefits of a lower power
resulting in longer battery life and
there you have it folks
eight handy tips to rein in performance
and extend your Android's battery of
course in this day and age our phones
are increasingly adept at proactively
serving us information which some of
these tips will aggressively disrupt so
we really aren't ever surprised when
people opt instead for better charging
solutions over trying to minimize their
phone usage and of course we want to
hear from you what's your power
management solution how do you balance
features against extending runtime drop

can help others use their phones more -
