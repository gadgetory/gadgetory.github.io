over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's take a second look at the
smartphone that proves you shouldn't
judge a gadget by its cover
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the sony xperia z3 compact and this
is episode 48 of after the buzz this
rear review is made possible by the
folks at 28 mobile if you want a sony z3
compact of your own do what we did head
on over to 28 mobile comm and get free
shipping on your order using offer code
pocket now check out the link in the
description below for years now we've
kind of tolerated the ever ballooning
size of the modern smartphone enjoying
the perks of the at a display real
estate but not the added pocket penalty
of carrying them we've adapted ourselves
to using them with one hand convincing
ourselves that these handheld acrobatics
aren't so bad not really well in this
weird world of denial we've created the
z3 compact feels like a breath of
much-needed long-forgotten sanity not
only can you comfortably hold it with
one hand you can use it all of it with
one hand - from the control keys at the
bottom to the notification shade up top
yeah you pay a penalty in screen size
and resolution down to 4 point 6 inches
in 720p but it only takes a few days to
get used to it and unless you use your
phone as your primary browsing device or
Netflix viewer the added usability more
than makes up for the drop in acreage oh
and while the port covers on the sides
are kind of annoying to deal with the
dual water and dust resistance ratings
are more than worth it Sony is one of
the few manufacturers that doesn't skimp
on specs with its smaller smartphones
this e3 compact is still pretty powerful
even almost a year after its
announcement a Snapdragon 801 with 2
gigs of RAM and expandable storage is
nothing to sneeze at and the
software responsiveness proves it our z3
here is running Android 5.0 2 with
Sony's custom UI and it just flies even
if you don't like Sony's design
aesthetic you also get a lot of useful
stuff here I don't think anyone else is
doing anything close to life log for
example which combines the power of a
mapping application fitness tracker a
notepad and more to track almost
everything you do during your day so you
can play it back later or plot your
activity on a chart over time sony also
removed its overbearing what's new
shortcut from the google now drag up
while retaining its little popover apps
not as useful as they would be in a
larger phone but still handy in a pinch
so where is the z3 compact gone wrong
well this isn't Sony's fault but the
Android lollipop update didn't do it too
many favors on one of our units what
used to be over five hours of screen on
time on KitKat fell to around four hours
SOT on lollipop and RAM management got
bungled too which also makes us
concerned about those two gigs of RAM
not being three or four which will
probably become the standard on the high
end by the end of 2015 the lack of
wireless charging means you've got to
fiddle with those port covers any time
you want to recharge it or buy a special
Sony dock which is annoying the fit and
finish is typical high-end Sony but the
all-glass build picks up scratches very
easily it slides off tables like
nobody's business and we've seen many
reports of the earphone jack
malfunctioning under very little strain
like leaving earbuds plugged in while
keeping the phone in a pocket that plus
the fragile SIM tray and the strange
clicking sound our demo unit makes when
we squeeze it detracts from an otherwise
excellent build the z3 compact camera
features a dedicated two-stage Hardware
button which we always like to see it's
amazing how much it improves the
shooting experience from starting the
camera app to the actual capture it's an
indispensable addition that you miss the
moment you switch to another phone what
you probably won't miss is the photo
quality the viewfinder has a lot of neat
tricks woven into it including an
intelligent auto capture mode that does
a pretty good job of deciding when to
apply
settings like HDR also you're going to
see a good amount of light and even
dimly lit shots and the 20 megapixel max
resolution makes for pretty sharp
captures but Sony's software often over
sharpens those images and it also
produces noisier photos than some of the
competition especially in low-light
where the problem is compounded by over
saturation the most damning test of this
camera came in a side-by-side contest
with the 2014 Moto X not our favorite
camera but it did a much better job at
handling a very dynamic scene Sony does
build a lot of fun stuff into the
viewfinder like augmented reality
effects and background defocus and so on
and it's digital stabilization is quite
good but once the novelty of that stuff
wears off which doesn't take long you'll
probably find yourself hankering for a
better simpler camera especially given
what Samsung and LG have been doing on
their phones this year today the z3
compact can be found unlocked for under
$400 in many ways what you get for that
is still excellent a water-resistant
smartphone with solid software
loudspeakers a look and feel you can't
find anywhere else and good battery life
now it's not excellent battery life
those speakers trade clarity for their
loudness and you'll want to make sure
you're careful with its glass finish and
it's earphone port plus it we'd happily
trade some of the software bloat for a
better overall camera but unless and
until Sony releases a z4 compact nothing
else out there is going to give you the
same power and style in such a tiny
package if that's your primary concern
and you don't care much about future
proofing the z3 compact is still a
pretty good buy as we come up on the
one-year mark
