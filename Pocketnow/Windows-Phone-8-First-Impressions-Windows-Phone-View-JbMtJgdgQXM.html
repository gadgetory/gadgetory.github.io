announcement of Windows Phone 8 to the
public windows phone 7.8 will be
available for legacy devices and the
marketplace currently has a hundred
thousand apps and Counting all this and
more coming up right now however what
I'm Jaime with parking out common
welcome to Windows Phone view the show
we wrap up all this week's good and bad
inside the world of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform now this week we're
starting off a little different because
we usually begin with Android revolution
but there are so many good news Windows
Phone 8 let's talk this week off with
what's good all right so there's a lot
of multi being mentioned and Windows
Phone 8 so let's begin first of all you
get multi core support in the past you
only got single core support so you were
pretty much limited to what you could do
with the phone even though it was
blazing fast but multi-core includes
dual core quad core it will all depend
on Microsoft and the roadmap for the
future cipher now you get multiple
resolutions being supported the past you
only got wvga and now you'll be getting
wxga which would be 1280 by 768 and also
720p that's really good other than that
you get entering Explorer 10 which
sport's a much better engine for
JavaScript HTML 5 it was being shown on
the videos and it was extremely faster
in comparison to other platforms you get
microsd support in the past you didn't
get expansion options on Windows Phone
which was kind of limited and other than
that you also get NFC support there are
a lot of really good changes coming with
Windows Phone 8 probably one of the
biggest ones that i haven't mentioned is
the new start screen the passion were
pretty much stuck with just two
different types of live tiles but you
couldn't determine which ones were
bigger or smaller now you'll be able to
determine which ones are smaller bigger
you get three sizes of shoes from
they're all really good kind of a little
clutter in my taste probably but I'd
like to hear what you think in the
comments down below tell us about it but
there's just so much to talk about
Windows Phone 8 that hit the link down
in the low with the description it'll
give you all the details of everything
that's being launched with Windows Phone
8 as of whenever they get it lunch and
that's probably what we're going to be
talking about in the bad section
now let's put all the rumors to arrest
one of our biggest concerns of Windows
Phone 8 was legacy devices and Microsoft
does have our back the list of Windows
Phone 8 features that are coming don't
make any sense to be supporting legacy
devices because they don't have multi
core they don't have NFC there are a lot
of features there that Microsoft's
pretty tied up with hardware limitations
to be able to bring these features to
old devices but Microsoft's going to be
launching windows phone 7.8 and they're
going to be bringing the same Windows
Phone 8 uy and user experience to the
Windows Phone 7 devices legacy devices
but you won't be getting the features
that are hardware-specific like NFC
multi-core support etc etc so apparently
even applications that are reported for
windows phone 8 specifically won't be
backward compatible but we're not really
sure if that's only you know multi-core
dependent or what's going to be the case
there but again you're still going to be
getting the same UI it's just going to
be limited to the things that your
device will be able to support or not
not sure what's going to happen with
tango devices but these are really good
news so one of the biggest things here
is that the rumors are that we are going
to be getting windows phone 7.8 on
devices like the Nokia Lumia 900 very
soon next couple of weeks means a lot so
we're not sure what soon means but
hopefully we will be getting it before
you know July August not sure what the
time frame is going to be but it's going
to be really cool to get this update
really soon for legacy devices now I
left one of the coolest features of
Windows Phone 8 separately for obvious
reasons it's cool enough to have its own
segment and the reason why is because
Microsoft is building this new speech
recognition service that's far superior
than Cirie and even s voice in my
opinion the reason being is because
Microsoft is not only porting the
service for the device itself but also
is bringing these api students can
create specific commands for in-app
services of speech that are currently
not being supported for other you know
iOS for example with Siri only supports
launched with iOS 6 and s voice is kind
of a mixed bag Microsoft is bringing the
service we haven't really seen it in
action other than within the demo so
it's going to be really interesting to
see how microsoft plans to handle this
because obviously there is a new type of
multitasking coming to Windows Phone 8
so I really sure how you're going to be
able to control music on a separate app
like for example Spotify with their
specific commands and having that not
come in conflict with other commands
with other applications time will tell
but again it's really cool to see that
Microsoft is really changing things here
because definitely those api's are going
to be quite useful the only problem will
be having to memorize this I hope that
Microsoft figures out a way for this to
be artificial intelligence for the
device to actually learn the commands
that you bring and not necessarily focus
I'm giving you specific things that
you'll have to memorize but time will
tell now there are two different
integrations coming with Windows Phone 8
that are definitely unique first of all
skype is going to work as it should
you'll now not be able to tell the
difference whether you're getting a
skype call or a typical voice call
coming from your device now not really
sure how they plan to make things happen
whenever you want to make a call for you
to be able to select within skype or the
phone line I really hope they make it
better with an Android for example we're
in Andrew you have to be selecting where
you want to make the call from I hope
it's a simple switch within Windows
Phone and you can actually just switch
it back whenever you want something
different not sure how that's going to
happen but hopefully that's going to be
really cool when it comes out another
interesting note coming out is the fact
that Nokia Maps and navteq are pretty
much going to be the new map service
coming to Windows Phone 8 so we will be
getting turned by turn navigation
natively you don't require a Nokia phone
from now on to be able to have this
service not sure if that's coming to
Windows Phone 7.8 but hopefully that
will be the case now obviously that
means that Bing Maps is gone not sure
why Microsoft is canning it and not
bringing turn-by-turn to bing maps but
interesting to see those kind of joint
ventures whenever you least expect that
you'll be hearing the voice saying hey
we just bought Nokia but why not they
just come out with their service tablet
so why not and speaking of service let's
end the good section talking about it
Microsoft is finally launching another
product like they did with the zune no
comment on that
but like they've been with the xbox now
we're finally getting a computer from
Microsoft and it's going to be called
the Microsoft Surface not the old table
this is going to be a tablet but it's
going to be a really unique tablet
because first of all you're going to
have a cover that's actually also a
keyboard don't think about the ipad
because this is coming directly from
Microsoft and it's totally a different
technology you're also getting this
really cool kick stand at the back so
you can be able to use your tablet in
different ways without depending on
accessories to make it work the way it
should now what's interesting is you
will be getting a Windows RT version
windows 8/rt sorry you will be also
getting an enterprise version that's
going to be much more expensive
apparently the windows RT version is
going to be slated in prices around
where the ipad is and then you'll also
have the enterprise version in prices
that are going to be leveling around the
laptop way kind of interesting because
this is pretty much a new form factor
for a laptop if you could consider it
not sure how Apple is going to react to
that with their future iPads or whatever
you know laptops they release eventually
because probably my biggest concern with
Microsoft is launch dates release dates
you never get them they take months to
happen and they give competition that
good heads up on what to do and honestly
this surface device is really cool
right so that bizarre for the good let's
continue on with what's bad and again as
I mentioned in the past segment what
really gets is worried about Microsoft
this timeliness its release dates we
never get them all we get us the fall
the holiday season they never come out
with a specific date of when we'll be
getting a product you know what the
problem with that is competition you
know Android for example is going to
take very little time to come out with
that little keyboard cover we've already
seen the Logitech keyboard cover with
the keyboard coming to the ipad so the
problem of Microsoft is specifically
that they take too long from when they
announced something to when they
launched and they're pretty much a
notorious for being late in some of the
things now I do understand the purpose
of being late for it to be great that's
fine but the problem is competition is
so fierce that Microsoft's innovation
goes down the drain with competition
pulling it out first and then calling it
bears you know what I'm talking about so
sadly surface is a really great product
I have a really good impression on it so
do I have for windows phone 8 but sadly
it's going to be pointless if everything
happens with competition at the same
time you know the iphone 5 or whatever
is going to be launched in the fall with
Windows Phone 8 and what are people
going to choose that's really the
problem with Microsoft lately they take
too long and I really do miss the old
Bill Gates days when they wouldn't make
announcements when those 95 was already
out before they announced it that's
really the way they should go back to
the roots the innovation is so good
don't announce it just launched the
thing I know you'll be successful that's
it for today show thank you very much
for watching I'm high Meadow iveta
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
