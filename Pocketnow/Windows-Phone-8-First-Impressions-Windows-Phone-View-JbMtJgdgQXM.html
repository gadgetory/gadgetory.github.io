announcement of Windows Phone 8 to the
public
Windows Phone 7.8 will be available for
legacy devices and the marketplace
currently has a hundred thousand apps
and Counting all this and more coming up
right now hello everyone i'm jaime with
parkin out common welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up all this
week's good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform now
this week we're starting off a little
different because we usually begin with
Android revolution but there are so many
good news Windows Phone 8 let's talk
this week off with what's good all right
so there's a lot of multi being
mentioned and Windows Phone 8 so let's
begin first of all you get multi-core
support in the past you only got single
core support so you were pretty much
limited to what you could do with the
phone even though it was blazing fast
but multi-core includes dual core quad
core it will all depend on Microsoft and
the roadmap for the future side from
that you get multiple resolutions being
supported the fast you only got WVGA and
now you'll be getting WXGA which would
be 1280 by 768 and also 720p that's
really good other than that you get
entering Explorer 10 which supports a
much better engine for JavaScript html5
it was being shown on the videos and it
was extremely faster in comparison to
other platforms you get microSD support
in the past you didn't get expansion
options on Windows Phone which was kind
of limited and other than that you also
get NFC support there are a lot of
really good changes coming with Windows
Phone 8 probably one of the biggest ones
that I haven't mentioned is the new
start screen and the passion were pretty
much stuck with just two different types
of laptops but you couldn't determine
which ones were bigger or smaller now
you'll be able to determine which ones
are smaller bigger you get three sizes
of shoes from they're all really good
kind of a little cluttering might taste
probably but I'd like to hear what you
think in the comments down below tell us
about it but there's just so much to
talk about Windows Phone 8 that hit the
link down below with the description
it'll give you all the details of
everything that's being launched with
Windows Phone 8 as of whenever they get
it launch and that's probably what we're
going to be talking about in the bad
section
now let's put all the rumors to arrest
one of our biggest concerns of Windows
Phone 8 was legacy devices and Microsoft
does have our back the list of Windows
Phone 8 features that are coming don't
make any sense to be supporting legacy
devices because they don't have
multi-core they don't have NFC there are
a lot of features there that Microsoft's
pretty tied up with hardware limitations
to be able to bring these features to
old devices but Microsoft's gonna be
launching Windows Phone 7.8 and they're
gonna be bringing the same Windows Phone
8 uy and user experience to the Windows
Phone 7 devices legacy devices but you
won't be getting the features that are
Hardware specific like NFC multi-core
support etc etc so apparently even
applications that are ported from
Windows Phone 8 specifically won't be
backward compatible but we're not really
sure if that's only you know multi-core
dependent or what's gonna be the case
there but again you're still gonna be
getting the same UI it's just gonna be
limited to the things that your device
will be able to support or not not sure
what's gonna happen with tangle devices
but these are really good news so one of
the biggest things here is that the
rumors are that we are gonna be getting
Windows Phone 7.8 on devices like the
Nokia Lumia 900 very soon next couple of
weeks means a lot so we're not sure what
soon means but hopefully we will be
getting it before you know July August
not sure what the timeframe is gonna be
but it's gonna be really cool to get
this update really soon for legacy
devices now I left one of the coolest
features of Windows Phone 8 separately
for obvious reasons it's cool enough to
have its own segment and the reason why
is because Microsoft is building this
new speech recognition service that's
far superior than Siri and even s voice
in my opinion the reason being is
because Microsoft is not only porting
the service for the device itself but
also is bringing these API Steudle
Apella pers can create specific commands
for in-app services of speech that are
currently not being supported for other
you know iOS for example with Siri only
supports launched with iOS 6 and S voice
is kind of a mixed bag Microsoft is
bringing the services we haven't really
seen in an action other than within the
demo so it's going to be really
interesting
see how microsoft plans to handle this
because obviously there is a new type of
multitasking coming to Windows Phone 8
so not really sure how are you gonna be
able to control music on a separate app
like for example Spotify with their
specific commands and having that not
come in conflict with other commands
with other applications time will tell
but again it's really cool to see that
Microsoft is really changing things here
because definitely those api's are gonna
be quite useful
the only problem will be having to
memorize this I hope that Microsoft
figures out a way for this to be
artificial intelligence for the device
to actually learn the commands that you
bring and not necessarily focus I'm
giving you specific things that you'll
have to memorize but time will tell now
there are two different integrations
coming with Windows Phone 8 that are
definitely unique first of all Skype is
gonna work as it should
you'll now not be able to tell the
difference whether you're getting a
Skype call or a typical voice call
coming from your device now not really
sure how they plan to make things happen
whenever you want to make a call for you
to be able to select within Skype or the
phone line I really hope they make it
better with than Android for example
we're in Android you have to be
selecting where you want to make the
call from I hope it's a simple switch
within Windows Phone and you can
actually just switch it back whenever
you want something different not sure
how that's gonna happen but hopefully
that's gonna be really cool when it
comes out another interesting note
coming out is the fact that Nokia Maps
and NAVTEQ are pretty much gonna be the
new map service coming to Windows Phone
8 so we will be getting turn-by-turn
navigation natively you don't require a
Nokia phone from now on to be able to
have this service not sure if that's
coming to Windows Phone 7.8 but
hopefully that will be the case now
obviously that means that Bing Maps is
gone I'm not sure why Microsoft is
canning it and not bringing turn-by-turn
to Bing Maps but interesting to see
those kind of joint ventures whenever
you least expect that you'll be hearing
the voice saying hey we just bought
Nokia but why not they just come out
with their service tablets so why not
and speaking of service let's end the
good section talking about it Microsoft
is finally launching another product
like they did with the Zune no comment
on that one but like they did with the
Xbox now we're finally getting a
computer from Microsoft and it's going
to be called the Microsoft Surface
not the old table this is gonna be a
tablet but it's gonna be a really unique
tablet because first of all you're gonna
have a cover that's actually also a
keyboard don't think about the iPad
because this is coming directly from
Microsoft and it's totally a different
technology you're also getting this
really cool kickstand at the back so you
can be able to use your tablet in
different ways without depending on
accessories to make it work the way it
should now what's interesting is you
will be getting a Windows RT version
Windows 8 RT sorry you will be also
getting an enterprise version that's
gonna be much more expensive
apparently the windows RT version is
going to be slated in prices around
where the iPad is and then you'll also
have the enterprise version and prices
that are gonna be leveling around the
laptop way kind of interesting because
this is pretty much a new form factor
for a laptop if you could consider it
not sure how Apple is gonna react to
that with their future iPads or whatever
you know laptops they release eventually
because probably my biggest concern with
Microsoft is launch dates release dates
you never get them they take months to
happen and they give competition that
good heads-up on what to do and honestly
this surface device is really cool
all right so that does it for the good
let's continue on with what's bad and
again as I mentioned in the past segment
what really gets us worried about
Microsoft this timeliness its release
dates we never get him always get us the
fall the holiday season they never come
out with a specific date of when we'll
be getting a product and you know what
the problem with that is competition you
know Android for example is gonna take
very little time to come out with that
little keyboard cover and we've already
seen the Logitech keyboard cover with
the keyboard coming to the iPad so the
problem of Microsoft is specifically
that they take too long from when they
announce something to when they launch
it and they're pretty much a notorious
for being late in some of the things now
I do understand the purpose of being
late for it to be great that's fine but
the problem is competition is so fierce
that Microsoft's innovation goes down
the drain with competition pulling it
out first and then calling it bears you
know what I'm talking about so sadly
surface is a really great product I have
a really good impression on it so do I
have for Windows Phone 8 but sadly it's
gonna be pointless if everything happens
with competition at the same time you
know the iPhone 5 or whatever is gonna
be launched in the fall with the Windows
Phone 8 and what are people gonna choose
that's really the problem with Microsoft
lately they take too long and I really
do miss the old Bill Gates days when
they wouldn't make announcements when
those 95 was already out before they
announced it that's really the way they
should go back to the roots the
innovation is so good don't announce it
just launch the thing I know you'll be
successful that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high memory that I remember to give us a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
