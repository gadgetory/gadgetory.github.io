Samsung Galaxy fold through review
display issues according to case makers
it looks like Apple will stick to the
ugly design of this or well last year's
iPhones and algae may be working on a
phone with a total of six cameras yeah I
said six I'm Jaime Matta Rivera and
today is a sad day but it won't last for
long so stick to the final segment this
is PocketNow Daly the official news
today are non-existent there are no
deals or at least no deals that are
worth covering so why don't we talk
about HTC 5g and Evan blaze and before
you ask me like why would these three
things be combined if you remember back
in January we covered that Evan had
discovered a codename and a device with
5g from HTC so for those of you
wondering exactly what is going to be
the feature of this product there is
Bluetooth certification right now on
Sprint for this HTC device we don't have
a code name but apparently everything
matches everything that Evan found and
therefore sprint well we'll see what is
going to happen now let's talk about
lenovo and their z6 pro if you
remembered we've been covering rumors
and a possible launch of this lenovo
device now we've got pretty much a
teaser of the company showing off four
cameras at the back if I got that right
one camera at the front and we're
getting teased that one of these cameras
is going to be of above 40 megapixels
and there's hyper video according to the
ad that we saw I've been like going
through Wikipedia over what hyper video
is and what exactly is we're getting
here Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in addition
to great specs and apparently even 5g so
stay tuned for that
and speaking of multiple cameras we've
got some leaks from LG that the company
is working on a new device with six
cameras we had five on the v40 we had
four on the g8 but we already know what
the V 50 is going to look like because
that's the 5g variant that already got
announced at MWC so we don't know
exactly what device is still pending in
the launch pipeline but yeah six cameras
three at the front row star wondering
what that
Cameron's gonna do probably a Z camera
we'll see now let's start about Apple
and iPhones for those of you that we're
expecting a better design for the next
generation models we've already gotten
molds being leaked which is what case
makers used to make their cases so after
this it's just going downhill where
we're getting the stove design for the
camera hump apparently it's going to be
horrible more horrible than the
protruding camera hump that we currently
get that makes the phone wobble on the
table it seems that we're getting triple
cameras on the Macs and the regular and
then the R is going to get dual cameras
and I'm just you know it's not the first
time that we see leaks of iPhones they
look ugly and then when we get the final
product doesn't look that bad this is
not pointing in the right direction or
Apple is just doing something really
smart about the leaks and finally the
hottest is should I have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy fold as the company has
decided to delay the launch for yours
already happened we already know that
it's sold out but for those of you that
did you're going to have to wait a
little more it seems that Samsung has
discovered a couple of the reasons why
the displays have been having issues and
therefore they're gonna take a little
more time to fix the problem before they
get it out to consumers up to the point
where we already got a call we have to
return this review unit tomorrow and
we're gonna get another review unit
later in order to be able to give you a
final review with the product that
consumers are going to be getting so for
those of you asking me in the future why
we're not doing the review on this
product as some other publications
already have well that's the reason why
stay tuned whenever we get a final
product we will but let us know in the
comments down below what do you think do
you think that Samsung is doing the
right thing or not in holding a little
bit in my case I think that it's the
right thing I feel really sad to have to
return this tomorrow because I haven't
had any issues with mine but obviously
I'd rather get the final retail variant
that you guys are gonna get so let us
know in the comments down below what you
think friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us on target now
comments stripped to both of our
channels english and spanish for more
videos like this one and also follow me
on twitter hanging underscore leave it
on instagram at high memory that i
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw
I'm highly metal because I think someone
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
