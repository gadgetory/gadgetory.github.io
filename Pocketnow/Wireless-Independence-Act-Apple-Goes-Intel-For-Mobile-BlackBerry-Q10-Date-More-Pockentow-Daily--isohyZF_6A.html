legalize smart phone unlocks rumors have
apple working with intel on mobile
processors and the blackberry q10 is now
rumored for t-mobile I'm high memory
vana and don't look at me funny I'm not
looking for the lady in red this is
pocket now daily I'm more blackberry
release rumors don't these just annoy
you the q10 was a really big mystery at
the event when they launched blackberry
10 because we didn't get quite a good
idea of when the device was gonna be
launched but now we have new rumors of
the device making it a tmobile first and
may have this year so stay tuned because
some of us like Brandon really want that
device now let's talk about nokia
they've taken software really seriously
when it comes to Windows Phone they've
launched a ton of applications recently
and now they've got a new one called
glam me but the purpose is that even
though it brings you filters for
photographs it's really made just for
portrait photos which is kind of
interesting because they've recently
launched that hashtag to instil with
love you know application recently and
we still don't see any Instagram is this
sort of like that but it's not really
that but it's really interesting to see
that no kick keeps on bringing more apps
and more apps to Windows Phone they're
making the battle really interesting now
sadly not everything is well when it
comes to Windows I mean Samsung is the
big player when it comes to smartphones
but in everything that has to do with an
Android we saw the Samsung a team tab
and a lot of us really wanted this
tablet back and Aoife and it was a
beautiful product at everything but well
sadly we eventually learned that it
wasn't coming to the United States and
now it's even being pulled by some
countries in Europe like Germany for
example over the fact that it doesn't
sell at all it just makes you wonder
what the problem is but we know what the
problem is it's called Windows RT it's a
great idea with terrible execution and
for those of you who were wondering how
the White House plans to bring carrier
unlocks to something that's legal well
it's called the wireless independence
act that's the name of the new bill
that's going to be passed it's going to
focus on making your carrier unlocks
legal obviously the idea is that if
you're already signing into your
contract with a carrier it's not like if
you could pull back easily from that
contract anyway so what's the point
about your phone being locked to the
carrier if you're already locked with
the contract anyway so stay tuned we're
not really
sure how long that's going to take but
obviously it's in the works and finally
for the interesting news of the day new
rumors have apple working with intel on
building mobile processors for their
future iOS products something we didn't
think that happened but it's not
historically new we do remember that Max
in the past used to use the PowerPC
processor which was built by motorola
and IBM but was later ditch because
these two companies couldn't put their
act together and they started using
intel processor almost simultaneously so
we did know that Enzo was having a hard
time with mobile processors but at the
same time we do know that every single
processor on iOS products is built by
Samsung and we do know how things are in
this department so that is a question of
the day how important is it for you will
the processor that your device is
running I mean in my particular case I
think we're come to the times where
that's really not that important i mean
processors it doesn't matter if it's a
quad-core a single or a dual-core
processor and probably single core
processors aren't as good as the
dual-core processors but then the quad
core processors haven't been as greater
has groundbreaking at the dual core
processor that we know so how important
is this to you to me well it doesn't
really matter except for the Tegra 3 I
was terrible of course as always if you
want an earlier soup of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
pacquiao comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
