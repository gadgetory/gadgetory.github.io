Samsung's most popular smartphone have
in common not a whole lot but we're
gonna compare them anyway I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
LG G flex versus a samsung galaxy s4 if
you look at both the LG G flex and the
galaxy s4 in a vacuum they're not
entirely different they don't have a lot
in common but they're sort of the same
in the sense that the s4 at launch with
Samsung's peek into the future of mobile
through software innovations likewise
the G flex is LG's take on the future
except in Hardware yes the note 3 and
Galaxy round are more direct comparisons
which make more sense but bear with us
here should you choose the more logical
safe smartphone or should your cash be
spent on what could be just another fad
in a long line of fleeting innovations
let's take a look if you were to
completely flatten out the G flex it in
the galaxy s4 honestly wouldn't look all
that different the G flex looks like an
odd mixture of the older Galaxy Nexus
and the Galaxy Note 2 except for the
rear power and volume buttons both the
Galaxy s4 and G flex have flat trim
around the edges centre fixed rear
cameras and minimal bezel one might call
their designs unremarkable if it weren't
for the curved nature of the G flex
which is its entire allure of course
it's notably a noticeably larger and
heavier than the Galaxy s4 it's a
hundred and sixty point five millimeters
tall 81 point six millimeters wide and
eight point seven millimeters thick
compared to the modest dimensions of the
galaxy s4 it's undeniably large it also
hits the scales at 177 grams or 47 grams
more than the s4 and that's where these
two devices diverge quite a bit the
Galaxy s4 is manageable with just one
hand without any sort of curvature it's
a moderate size with plenty of display
real estate foremost at 6 inches the G
flex is like many other recent
smartphones gigantic with more display
than some might know what to do with LG
claims the curved nature of the display
not only makes such a large phone easier
to manage it conforms to your face when
talking on the phone provides a more
cinematic experience in multimedia
playback
and its lack of rigidness might make it
slightly more durable from your typical
bumps and drops we're certainly not sold
on the ergonomic factor though we still
find ourselves struggling with wielding
at one handed once the newness of the
curved display wears off it feels more
like a novelty than a feature in the
name of science and sadistic
entertainment however our own michael
fisher put the self-healing backside and
flexibility of the G flex to the test
and that aspect of the G flex is praise
worthy the design and build of the
Galaxy s4 as we've covered time and time
again is unmoving after months on the
market
it feels generic and still hasn't lost
that toy like feel that said it's
reliability and resilience alone go a
very long way on the inside the G flex
has a slight advantage over the Galaxy
s4
it has call comes much-loved Snapdragon
800 chipset composed of a 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core Krait CPU and Adreno 330 GPU
the CDMA galaxy s4 we have bares the
Snapdragon 600 chip though the s4 is
also available in both Exynos octa-core
and 800 variants in other regions around
the globe outside that both have 2
gigabytes of RAM 13 megapixel cameras
bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi AC infrared NFC and
LTE support the G flex has a 3500
milliamp hour battery only comes in a 32
gigabyte variant and comes equipped with
LTE advanced capabilities though that's
currently useless unless you're in South
Korea as is the DMV antenna the galaxy
s4 s removable battery is rated at 2600
milliamp hours and it comes in 16 32 or
64 gigabytes storage options globally
we're all familiar with the Galaxy S 4 s
5 inch 1080p Super AMOLED display it's a
tad oversaturated but it looks fantastic
with great contrast brightness viewing
angles color reproduction and clarity
it's one of the sharpest best-looking
displays out there with a density of 441
pixels per inch
LG instead went with a P OLED display in
the G flex like the s4 s display it's
quite saturated and blacks look great as
they typically do on any LED style
display the curvature also makes for
decent viewing angles but with the
resolution of 720p on a 6 inch display
the visual experience of the G flex is
nothing exceptional
at full brightness the display looks
pretty nice but under close inspection
there is some noticeable pixelation if
you drop the brightness at all the low
points of the display become visible
the further you take the brightness
slider down the worse the display gets
at roughly 50% brightness whites appear
gray and almost like parchment and
highly saturated solids and gradients
become noticeably grainy with faint
signs of image retention or ghosting
pull the notification shade down leave
it for a second or two and swipe it back
up the elements from the shade such as
toggles or cue slide apps are still
faintly visible and quickly fade away
it's not the worst display we've ever
seen it has some great qualities but
once you see the ghosting ingrained it's
difficult to unsee
as far as hardware goes however we like
the unprecedented curb display and
self-healing backside of the G flex we
give the edge to the G flex mainly for
creativity and on a quality level the G
flex feels more solid but honestly the
practical differences are few and far
between
oddly enough both the G flex and Verizon
Galaxy S 4 are running the same versions
of software Android version 4.2.2 jelly
bean and while LG has done wonders to
improve the appearance of his custom
software with the Flex theme the core
differences between TouchWiz and LG's
custom software are surprisingly slim
both come with eye tracking software to
keep the display on when the users eyes
are panning the display both have split
pane true multitasking software accessed
by long pressing the back button the
notification shades and settings
applications look surprisingly similar
and wealth busy visually the two are
different but from the overbearing
symphony of noises touch with an LG
software play on every touch to the bevy
of additional software features over the
stock Android experience the two devices
have incredibly similar software
offerings despite a few differences here
and there surprisingly performance wise
these two are very similar you might
initially want to give the G flakes a
leg up due to the Snapdragon 800 but
lest we forget just how powerful the
Snapdragon 600 truly is sure in
benchmarking and at various tasks the G
flex probably seems significantly more
powerful and faster than the Galaxy s4
but it's honestly negligible
while one stutters while opening an app
the other is blazing fast and vice versa
both may provide a smooth experience
most of the time but their heavily-laden
interfaces are to blame for intermittent
lag and hang-ups that wouldn't otherwise
be there the G flex feels more
comfortable and roomy for gaming and
multimedia playback and it does have a
little additional horsepower to food but
honestly both of these phones will slice
through just about anything you can
throw at them without too much trouble
the loudspeakers on both devices are
quite large and loud they're quite
literally as comparable as it gets their
rear-facing provide an acceptable
balanced sound and they're both equally
loud if anything the G flex provides a
slightly more full sound we weren't able
to test data speeds or call quality on
the Verizon Galaxy s4 as we do not have
an active sim that fits you can however
check our several galaxy s4 reviews for
more data on that but the supported
bands of the G flex limits it to 3G on
AT&amp;amp;T here in the States call quality is
modest but data speeds aren't the
greatest battery life is a landslide
victory for the G flex as it
epically is for larger smartphones the
3500 milliamp hour battery inside
manages to power the G flex through a
full day of heavy usage quite easily it
manages to power through six and seven
hours of screen on time the Galaxy S 4
stamina isn't anything to scoff at but
it's in an entirely different league
averaging three to four hours of screen
on time through roughly the same amount
of usage both cameras are rated at 13
megapixels and neither are optically
stabilized through snapping a handful of
photos throughout the day we couldn't
help but lean towards the galaxy s4 the
colors may air a bit on the vibrant side
after making them look surreal but
images taken when the G flex appeared
washed out and low on contrast the s4
seems to have sharper focus and we had
fewer issues with shutter speed and
shaking us on the galaxy s4 for what
it's worth both cameras performed poorly
in low-light situations but the s4
squeaks out a small victory in image
sensing so what can we make of all this
it's quite simple really the Galaxy s4
is a solid option for just about anyone
in the smartphone game the performance
is reliable the hardware is decent and
it provides one of the most balanced
experiences available today it's a safe
bet but it's ageing technology old news
the G flex is a gamble of sorts
it's bag of tricks may be nothing more
than a gimmick you have to ask are the
sparse benefits of a curved smartphone
worth the additional money until the G
flex sees a more widespread launch it's
only available through limited channels
for a whopping $1,000 if you're a
gung-ho early adopter the G flex is the
perfect way to get your hands on
cutting-edge technology and show it off
but this technology comes with its
caveats namely the display quality is
nowhere near comparable to other
flagships for now we recommend most
stick to the Galaxy S 4 but a year from
now and another iteration of each that
recommendation just might change that's
