calm and we're going to take a look at
the software on the lg optimus 2x right
here we're going to take a look at now
some of the bundled apps that comes with
by default as well as some of the LG
customizations so right away we see our
lock screen and this is a little
different we got some nice notifications
here oh we've got a number of emails we
have and a voicemail would probably show
the number of text messages if I had any
so and we got the clock right there a
nice big clock and what network I'm
connected to so let's slide up to unlock
and see some big raindrops fall on the
screen that's because it's raining
outside and this is our default home
screen it's got some four icons at the
bottom kind of similar to what Sampson
has done with their flavor of Android
and we got our home screens you can
click the cross of course we all know
that from Android and down here is the
applications trade of course and this
scrolls up and down and we have our
default widget here it shows the weather
some temperature and the time I don't
know why but the time up here is
different so that's something that came
there by default and we have our
notifications tray of course got enough
occasions olive earlier and you have a
play button so we automatically have the
music player here even if you're not
running the music player and we have
some switches for there's your volume
there's your Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and
screen rotation lock
now again this is kind of weird because
you should it often so that doesn't
rotate but still doesn't rotate that way
so you have to go into some other
program to figure out if that is on or
off or working at all so the that you
just saw if I tap the home button again
we get our little thumbnails of all the
home screens so you can quickly jump to
whichever one you want and you can
notice the speed on this sometimes
pretty quick if we do like that and but
sometimes it's kind of slow in a way
next let's look at the phone dialer
pretty standard there come on and let's
look at what we have for applications we
have a a stock's so I this is going to
be a stock program remember and we can
just get some stock information there
let's go back one plot browser
calculator nothing terribly special and
we have our car interface
that looks pretty nice next design
we have f-secure so that's nice it comes
with the antivirus or scanning right now
so I'm going to stop you got an FM radio
of course that looks pretty nice little
I have to connect headphones but it's
nice and brown to match the back here's
another special signed LG movie guide so
this is going to show me some movie
thumbnails and after
and here's some movies I don't really
know what this does but there's that we
also have LG newsreader and again I'm
not sure what's going on here so I
assume this is some kind of news let's
get back
we have a mirror and what this does is
turn the front freezing camera on okay
a lot of these bundled apps are not in
the language that I understand so not
sure what's going on there openrice
however we do have a couple good ones
I'm going to skip the others we have
twitter for LG so that's a custom
twitter app and we have facebook for LG
custom facebook app pretty cool
there you go looks a little different
than the native one and let's see what
we have for wallpapers
comes with some interesting ones
there's some bubbles this one is a
really distracting
I see fireworks and must be a deserted
kind of default android things okay next
up let's look at we have for widgets in
here oh I didn't want to do that I
wanted to go to oh well we have to wait
for it anyway there we are there's our
widgets list let's go back I want to
look at LG widgets so here we have some
special ltu widgets
see our social feeds oh and I have to
choose a different home screen so that's
nice custom social feed widget there my
status pretty nice
well we got a force close
okay whew let's see what else we got so
here's something else you can press the
menu button on the home screen and
there's home settings where we can
choose how many home screens to have
can't like choose weird numbers you can
only choose three five or seven so you
can see that will change the number that
you've got there also let me show you
the default keyboard that pops up when
we go into a text field oh no what is
that that's an America pad use back in
the days when people use to dial phones
with numbers so to get texts you got to
type each letter or each button multiple
times to get the right letter and
there's no obvious way to get a qwerty
keyboard right here so what you have to
do is get out of your first go to normal
settings find the keyboard options now
you think I would just be able to go to
input method and change it to something
else but no you only have one option
there so you have to choose this button
and then keyboard layout and then we can
choose a qwerty keyboard so there we go
and getting it back that's a little
better it doesn't have any prediction
really but it works all right
ok lastly let's take a look at the video
player now I was able to load a couple
videos on here and so let's check out
this one and we're going to see how
quickly how quickly we can skip let's
just out right away instantly goes to
that point in the video so pretty quick
on the video let's look at another one
here
the video quality is really nice
this is presumably taking full advantage
of the dual core tegra 2 processor of
course we can output it to hdmi but it
didn't come with a cable so we're not
going to try that because you can't so
there's a video let's go back home so
that's it for our software tour of the
LG optimus 2x this device is available
now from negri electronics com hope you
enjoyed this video give us a thumbs up
if you liked it that's it for now
