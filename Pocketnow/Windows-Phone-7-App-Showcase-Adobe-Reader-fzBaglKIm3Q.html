pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to review adobe reader for windows
phone 7 so you can check out PDFs on
your phone let's take a look now right
now this is not available in the
marketplace so if you get an email for
example that has a PDF it's going to
forward you to the marketplace but it's
not going to let you download it because
it's not available it should be
available in October or November this
particular device happens to have it
already pre-loaded so what we can do
here is go into outlook I've just sent
myself a PDF so here it is and there's
the attachment so I'm going to tap on it
and it's going to download it'll take
probably about 10 seconds and see if
there it says downloading now it's done
and let's open the PDF it's a very
simple PDF reader that works quite
effectively this is a tax form so we can
do is scroll between the pages you get
to see the boundaries and there are a
few things you can do to manipulate this
document obviously if you want to get a
landscape view because it's very small
in portrait you can do that we have some
tools over here so we can go to the next
page by pressing down arrow here we can
also zoom in a little bit although you
can use pinch-to-zoom quite well
although it's not as smooth as you're
going to get in the photos application
it kind of zooms out and then it takes a
minute to refocus itself but overall the
PDF support and Windows Phone 7 is quite
good and this works in the web too so I
was searching google for a particular
PDF i click the link it was a dot PDF
URL it opened up adobe reader seamlessly
so it works very well so that's a look
at adobe reader for windows phone 7 and
by the way there is a program associated
with this just want to show you real
quick which will give you a listing of
all the recent PDFs that you have opened
so here we have that form 1040 that I
just showed you this way you can go back
and say hey which PDFs were looking at
even if it was on a website or in an
email attachment all in one spot please
thumbs up this video if you liked it and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
