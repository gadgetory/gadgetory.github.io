Android 4.3 deployment plans rumors have
it the Samsung is ditching their
fingerprint scanner on the note 3 and
Consumer Reports is already questioning
the photo quality of the Lumia 1020 I'm
hi Mary vera and at a perfect world
nobody would ever question smartphone
cameras this is out daily let's
first a off with the boring typical
nails of the LG g2 I mean we pretty much
know everything about this phone and
still company executives believe that we
need to know more we already know that
there is an Argus seventh of it
happening to launch the phone that we
already know about and apparently it
will be available in Asia just a couple
of days later but it will come to the
United States until September and to
Europe until early October um are any of
you actually waiting for this phone now
in some odd reports early 2013 was all
about ir blasters and it seems that late
2013 was going to be all about
fingerprint scanners and the samsung
galaxy note 3 was going to be the first
phone to bring this feature back into
smartphones but apparently semi is
ditching the whole project because their
vendor is not able to provide as many
modules as they need for all the note
3's that they plan to sell and how many
of you are actually meeting this feature
right now is my question now if you
thought that the Nokia Lumia 625 is the
only quote big phone that Nokia's
working on well no apparently the
company's got another project up their
sleeves with this big Gigantor display
being leaked in photos now for the Vice
that apparently will see the light of
day sometime in 2014 though we don't
know if it'll ever leave the oven and we
don't know if Windows Phone 8.1 ever
will ever support it but stay tuned and
speaking of Nokia for the record the
Nokia Lumia 1020 is the best smartphone
camera that we've ever tested but
Consumer Reports seems to disagree in
their unofficial reports it seems that
well they're having problems with color
accuracy and also some bluish tint
whenever a lighting conditions vary
which is kind of interesting since we
haven't had that problem but judging by
the fact that consumer reports is that
company that said that the iphone 4 was
the best smartphone they've ever tested
in 2010 and then we had antenna gate
problems
whatever and finally for the
much-anticipated news of the day OEM
azhar already discussing Android 4.3 in
their update path and well shown he has
so far confirmed that all their 2013
Lumia lineup or pretty much all of it is
going to get the update and that's
really sad because we've got some
experiencies Jays and others that were
launched late 2012 that should be
getting the update and won't sadly now
Samsung and HTC have also confirmed that
select devices will be getting it but
they're not providing a specific list
and don't you just hate how frustrating
it can be with Android but that leads
you to the question of the day what
current android smartphone do you have
if you have an Android smartphone and
are you expecting to get Android 4.3 on
your device do you think that your OEM
will support your current device in my
particular case my galaxy note 2 first
has to get four point two point two so
you can imagine my frustration but leave
us a comment down below what's your
situation of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tableau
