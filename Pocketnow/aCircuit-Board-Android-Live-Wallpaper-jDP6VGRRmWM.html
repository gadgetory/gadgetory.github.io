packing.com and today we're checking out
a circuit board which in my opinion is
one of the coolest new live wallpapers
for Android if you're into product tear
downs and seeing what's on the inside of
some of your favorite electronics then
this wallpaper is a perfect fit for you
it animates you can interact with it
let's check it out all right as you can
see this wallpaper has a circuit board
theme to it there are lights blinking in
the background we have a moving fan and
there are just a lot of interesting
things going on here so let's take a
closer look at it by swiping over to the
side and as you can see over in the top
left here we actually have a binary
clock and it's really cool that the
developer was able to fit this into the
wallpaper just adds a nice touch to it
and next to that we have indicator
lights for GPS Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so
depending whether you have those toggled
on or off they'll actually light up for
you down over here we have the fan that
I mentioned earlier which moves and now
we're going to get into the interesting
stuff you can actually interact with the
wallpaper just like on many other live
wallpapers for Android so let's go ahead
and tap on some of these components you
can see it starts to blink and then the
whole circuit board sort of lights up
and it just goes crazy just a nice touch
okay and we can actually go over to the
other side and we can do the same here
you'll see that these lights sort of
bounce up and down and we can actually
tap over here and you'll see the raw
Android robot will actually glow for you
so again just a really nice lighting
effect and overall look to this circuit
board theme and finally if we double tap
on the screen the fan will shut down and
then the screen will dim so it gives you
this feeling that you're shutting the
wallpaper down obviously some lights are
still blinking the background and you
can still click on these components but
overall you get the feeling that you
actually
shut the wallpaper down so really cool
effect let's turn it back on you see
some lights blinking up in the top and
if we're back up and running
so let's actually check out some
settings here we can go to wallpaper
live wallpapers circuit board and we'll
go to settings click on the first option
this actually allows us to add some
screen effects so we can add a broken
screen effect dust on the screen or both
I'll go ahead and go with both and show
you what that looks like we can change
the brightness of the wallpaper in case
it kind of hurts your eyes let's go back
we can enable or disable some lighting
effects and the binary clock and down
here we just have some additional
information so let's go back here and
there we go we have the broken screen
and some dust accumulating on the
circuit board so some other options you
can use I prefer to use the wallpaper
just without these options but some of
you may like them so that about does it
for this live wallpaper it really takes
the inner geek in all of us and just
plasters it onto the screen again it's
called a circuit board and you can find
it easily on the android market
it's listed at 99 yen which is around
one dollar and twelve cents so it's not
free but it's certainly a bargain if you
like it this is currently my favorite
wallpaper but I'm actually interested to
hear what wallpaper reigns supreme on
your Android device right now so feel
