announcement of the boulder 1 plus 3t
Apple is reportedly out to compete with
the funk Google glass if you can get
your hands on a Nintendo classic super
mario run is your consolation prize I'm
hi Mary vera and I'm running on two
hours of sleep so bear with me here but
we're back at the studio this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with deals the LG g5 may have not been
our favorite smartphone this year
because there was a lot of potential not
much delivered and well if you're in the
market for one right now you should look
up at best buy the company has just
started publishing its deals for black
friday we're talking about a $300 gift
card of you buy the g5 which pretty much
leaves the phone for like 4 250 dollars
that is insane other official news have
to do with whatsapp yes we know it's not
big in the United States but it's huge
outside and well the company has just
announced its new video chatting service
sort of like FaceTime only now it's
working through whatsapp it is a really
cool service though the problem is it's
obviously going to take some time to
deploy its announcing 1 billion users
will be getting it over the next few
days so stay tuned and if you join me in
being one of those people that went
crazy trying to buy that mes classic
from Nintendo and didn't have any luck
Nintendo has just announced that Super
Mario run will be launching on iOS
exclusively on December 15 and don't
worry you won't have to be paying all
those crazy subscription prices it's
just a ten dollar price tag and that's
pretty much it that's all you have to
pay for the application going forward
this is great news some of you may find
the application to be a little expensive
I actually don't mainly because again i
hate that freemium model where you're
able to play a little of the game and
they have to pay a lot of money to
continue playing so yeah december 15 now
let's talk about Apple we've got some
very trusted sources claiming that the
company is working on its own augmented
reality bear in mind Apple is not a
company that launches everything a test
and the company is very famous for
prototyping we hear that it's not
planning to compete against hollow lens
but instead compete against something
more to the tone of google glass and i
was one of those people that felt the
google glass was creepy so we can't wait
to see what it is but the rumors claim
28 th and finally the very hot dishes
they have to do with one pluses the
company has surprised everyone with a
new one plus 3t and even though it looks
a lot like the one plus three it's got a
new color option gunmetal a new storage
option 128 gigs a larger battery 3400
milliamp hours even though the chassis
doesn't weigh more than it did before
we've got the new Snapdragon 801
processor improvements in the camera and
the display and this is just a list of
few things that have changed with this
phone obviously it retains the same
similar design that we loved about the
one plus three our review unit will be
arriving shortly for us to tell you more
about it but it does leave me to the
question of the day given the
similarities with the one plus three
what would you like for us to test
during our review period in my case I
will be honest with you I cannot wait to
see what that Snapdragon 821 does but
leave us a comment down below we love to
know European friends you know the way
it goes if you want to get the news
