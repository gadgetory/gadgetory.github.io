pocketnow.com it is time to give you our
final thoughts on the sony ericsson x10
mini you've seen our coverage this far
let's go ahead and wrap things up first
off we're going to touch on a few of the
positives of the sony ericsson x10 mini
device one of the great things about
this phone is actually the form factor
it's a very small form factor so if
you're into using a small device
something that you can barely feel in
your pocket this device is going to be
for you on top of that because it is so
small sony has actually customize the
user interface to fit one handed
operation sony has taken that design a
step further by including a snap on type
skin is actually the back battery cover
of the phone they're going to give you
the default black which is already on
the device as well as three other colors
and that really goes a long way that
allows the user to personalize their
device gives them a different taste on
things that you know really makes your
phone unique to you whereas having to
walk around with the default black or
the grey typical colors you would see
instead you can now change the color
another thing with this phone is despite
the fact that it has a very very small
screen the typical applications such as
YouTube Twitter the Facebook's the web
browser they're all there you don't
sacrifice on that sense you can still
get done what you need to get done you
can still send out an email if need be
you can watch a YouTube video post to
Twitter update so on and so forth
another great feature that you don't
miss out on despite the small size of
this device is actually a 5 megapixel
camera with the ability to record video
now it is a very tiny phone as I've
mentioned numerous times wherever you
still can take pictures with the
hardware camera button so it is almost
like having a independent camera in your
pocket however everything is now
conversion to one very small device the
speaker on this phone itself is
extremely loud so when you're using a
speaker phone call you can hear your
caller without an issue at all and if
you're watching a video or listening to
music it works great another cool thing
about this device is it does have the FM
radio capability so if you do listen to
the FM radio at all pop on the Sony
headphones you can listen right to your
favorite radio station now getting into
some of the cons of the device or what
needs work the 2.5 screen can really
take away from the user experience if
you're after a very small screen then
that's fine however if you're used to
sending a lot of emails and a lot of
text messages that are a long length the
fact that you lose out on a full
board because of the size of the screen
really makes me feel like I'm missing a
piece here it makes it tough to send out
an entire email or a long text message
sony is releasing an x 10 mini pro
version which actually has a slide-out
qwerty keyboard which will make this
device much easier in that sense however
if you now used to sending out emails or
you just sent out quick text messages
here and there this is perfect for you
another downside expect this device uses
android 1.6 some of the applications are
not compatible 1.6 anymore unfortunately
such as the official twitter application
you have to be on at least android 2.0
to use that application so you will miss
out on some of the newer apps as they
become available or until Sony decides
that they want to upgrade this device
itself unfortunately the talk time on
the sony ericsson x10 mini is only rated
at three and a half hours if you do a
lot of talking on the phone the battery
is not going to last you a whole day
other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S
are rated at around five to six hours so
you can come to a comparison there as
far as what you're going to be missing
out on with this device they're staying
on the topic of the battery whether or
not you may consider this to be a pro or
a con the battery is non-removable now I
know phones like the iPhone have had a
lot of problems and a lot of attention
to that department because the battery
is not removable so if that's not a
problem for you fine if it is this may
turn your way in fact that the phone is
so small part of that is due to the very
fact that you cannot take the battery
out another downside and i'm not sure
why this is this may be a hardware issue
a software issue for that matter is that
you can only actually upgrade the micro
SD card to a 16 gigabyte this device is
not capable of reading any higher than
that now that may be able to be patched
with a software update however I'm not a
hundred percent sure so if you're
thinking about getting a sony ericsson
x10 really think about that if you put
on using any more than 32 gigs of data
this is not going to use that most
phones most people for that matter don't
on their phones but if you are that may
not be right for you rounding everything
off I do have to say that most of your
staples are going to be here you're
going to have your Wi-Fi you're going to
do GPS and your Bluetooth and once again
you're going to have support for your
mainstream applications that you may be
finding yourself using on a daily basis
all in all this is actually a very nice
phone if you're looking for a small form
factor of a phone this phone may be for
you just keep in mind some of the
shortcomings that it may have in terms
of these software in the hardware the
custom user interface thats only does
include with this phone really makes
this device much easier to use much
easier to navigate
eight it's much easier to fire off a
very quick text message with the typical
multi-tap keyboard regardless of the
fact that you do not have the full
QWERTY coming in at about only 325 u.s.
dollars sony has really made this device
affordable to the masses it's something
that interests you can go ahead and pick

least check out the full written review
