time of year back to school so we've
composed a list of applications which
should help you ease back into the new
school year
I'm sailor Martin this is PocketNow and
here are five essential back-to-school
apps for iOS
last week we gave Android users some
very helpful back-to-school applications
to help ease them back into the school
year as requested - here are five
essential back-to-school apps for iOS it
goes without saying that Khan Academy is
one of the best online tools for
learning just about anything
math science economics arts computing
etc choose your course the specific
subject in question and watch an
in-depth video on the concept with some
example problems using the iOS app is
hardly any different than viewing Khan
Academy from the computer it has all the
same content as the website except you
can download videos and take them with
you for offline viewing simply long
press the title of a video to download
it the Khan Academy application is a
must-have for any student of any age
best of all it's entirely free another
must-have application for iOS is a
Wolfram Alpha the computational
knowledge engine if you have a question
be at mathematics physics chemistry
about the population of a certain area
or just about anything else
Wolfram Alfred likely has an answer you
can do currency conversions elaborate
physics equations or look up gasoline
prices the Wolfram Alpha application
also has dozens of examples to choose
from if you're not sure how to ask your
question if you're a student you'll be
doing yourself a favor by skipping
coffee one day and spending $2.99 on the
Wolfram Alpha app keeping track of
everything is essential for school goers
and we have two applications which are
perfect for just that first is the free
calendar application sunrise on the
surface is just another pretty calendar
app with Google Calendar support it has
an agenda view fixated below the month
view and sliding to the left reveals the
week view however sunrise has some nifty
features beneath one it has inline
weather information
it also has support for several
third-party accounts Google iCloud
Microsoft Exchange Facebook TripIt asana
product eve github linkedin Songkick
Foursquare Twitter and Evernote it also
has built-in calendars for downloads
such as religious or holiday calendars
sport calendars week numbers moon phases
and stock exchange calendars one of the
best calendar apps around sunrise it's
available on Mac web Android and iOS and
it's completely free
the second application for keeping check
of everything is todoist as the name
suggests todoist
is a task list manager again on the
surface it seems pretty basic you can
sort your tasks into various projects
and prioritize them you can also add
labels and reoccurring dates to tasks as
well but there's much more to to-do list
like advanced search tasks notes and
file uploads reminders and calendar sync
if you pay the $29 annual fee in other
words you can add your tasks to de duyst
and view them in sunrise
a combination I found to be
irreplaceable todoist is available
across several different platforms
Android iOS Chrome Firefox Mac OS
Windows outlook and it even has a gmail
plug-in to add tasks directly from
emails
note-taking applications are a dime a
dozen and most of them are packed to the
brim with frivolous features Vesper is
the exact opposite
it's a minimalist notetaking application
which only has a handful of features by
design group related notes by tagging
them order them in a way which makes
most sense to you by long-pressing and
dragging attached photos and sync your
notes using the built-in sync function
when you're done with a note you can
swipe it away to archive it so it's out
of the way but not totally deleted other
than that you can adjust the typography
settings all caps size and weight Vesper
is lightweight and makes creating quick
notes a breeze and it's only $2.99 what
are your must-haves back-to-school
applications for iOS share them in the
comments below folks thanks for watching

it helpful be sure to click the thumbs
