success plus by a long shot we get the
latest batch of too good to be true
rumors for the oneplus mini and it seems
that LG phones will be enjoying
marshmallow sooner than we thought I'm
hi Mary vera and can somebody please
explain to me why mondays are called
Mondays this is parking out daily
official news today begin with motorola
and google kind of weird google sold
motorola but now it's making
announcements for motorola you remember
that moto play that wasn't going to be
launched the united states it's a
beefed-up moto x with some lesser specs
some better specs in other cases well
it's now going to be available in
verizon as the droid maxx too which is
great news which is trying to figure out
why google's making this announcement
let's continue with google but move the
spotlight over to a sooz those of you
that are looking for a very affordable
android wear SmartWatch the ax susan
watch too is now available in the Google
Play Store you can get it for 150
dollars and this is just crazy it is an
amazing price tag for a very good watch
that we are already reviewing so
obviously expect their final verdict but
so far you're getting a lot for that
money it's really a great deal and if
you join me in two things hating LG's UI
on the g4 and how sluggish it is and
wishing that marshmallow was launched
for its well we've got some very
interesting developments LG support
website is already claiming android 6th
auto as part of its support for the g4
and the g3 but obviously we have no
announcements so this could be that we
will get the update soon and obviously
the g4 will be the first let's just hope
our carrier variants get it as quick as
well one device that made a lot of
headlines last week was the oneplus X or
1 plus mini whatever you want to call it
we've got more details on its
specification xand forget about the
snapdragon 801 trusted sources claim
that it's actually going to be carrying
a MediaTek Helio x10 which is actually
not a bad processor at all in addition
to two gigs of ram and a probable 32
gigs of expandable storage in addition
to a 5-inch display so yeah this device
is really not going to be that bad
Phylly they can price it accordingly
because we've got some blue devices out
there that rocked the same processor and
offer really good price tags for their
phones and finally for the very hot news
of the day if you've been wondering
exactly which iphone has sold the most
in last couple of days what Apple is not
going to tell you they never provide
details and obviously the information
right now is kind of scarce because you
have to remember information really
provides more detail with the iphone 6
that's been in the market for a while
and not the 6s but according to that
obviously the iphone 6 is selling more
than 6 plus as well but then in the case
of the 6s and 6s plus well it's actually
dwarfing the success plus meaning the
smaller variant is selling more than
twice than the larger one which is
pretty much the case last year with the
iphone 6 as well but it leads me to the
question of the day why do you think
that people prefer the smaller very into
the phablet what case in particular
because hey there are a ton of benefits
in the case of the 6s plus but for me it
has to do with the price tag leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video was filmed make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com it's a short
radio channel as well it followed me on
twitter Jaime underscore a better on
Instagram at high Meadow a better please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high memory but I'm
take you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
