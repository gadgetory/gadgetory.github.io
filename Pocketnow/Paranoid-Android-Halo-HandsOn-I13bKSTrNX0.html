brought with them a new and updated
notification scheme called halo one
problem it can only display one
notification at a time they fix that let
me show you how this is my nexus 4 it is
unlocked it is rooted and it is running
the latest version of paranoid android
this is the latest nightly in fact it is
so recent it is today's date this is May
fourteenth 2013 I had to do that because
previous versions didn't necessarily
work right there were some bugs in there
I had to go all the way up to tonight's
build and it looks like everything is
running nice and smooth and buttery this
I believe is stable enough to be my
daily driver but what do I want to show
you if you come over here and look you
can see I've got this little
notification at halo it's called that
because it's got this little nice ring
around it that ring is the halo imagine
angels or whatnot and that's what that
is inside of it it contains a
notification in this case you can kind
of see it's tucked off to the side it's
got this gmail notification in here
saying I've got 10 unread messages holy
criminy that's a lot I've got to go and
read those but the problem that they had
up until recently was it can hold one
notification now if you look up at the
top I don't have a notification bar in
fact I don't have any any quick buttons
down at the bottom where are they well
I've got them all over in here and if
you notice I've got my notifications
there and I can go home and back into
settings and you know wherever I want to
go there with these pie controls but I
don't want to necessarily have to go
into this all the time I mean that's
kind of a distracting task if I'm busy
doing something to have to go in and do
it so let's say I'm already in my app
I'm working on some settings here and I
want to see what this notification is
and see what all my notifications are in
fact what I do is I come over there I
can tap on it and looking at that this
is the first feature notice i have my
gmail right here in a very very nice pop
up window something that you don't see
all that often except in samsung powered
devices is a window
of a nap or a nap in a window very cool
I can now do whatever I need to hear if
I want to reply to this I can open it up
I can read it I can reply to it I'm in
here let's compose okay and go ahead and
send that away great I'm still here I
can still go back I guess so whatever I
need to do in my gmail it's great if I
want to go back to where I was before I
go back I haven't lost any of my context
and really I don't need to go into the
entire experience to do quick things
just like that of course if I want to I
can always go back home and launch the
full-blown application I can or I can't
it doesn't matter it's up to me you use
your preference which is nice but what
if I've got other notifications which I
know I do what you do is you come in
here and I tapped on it again you do is
you tap and hold and drag down and if
you notice I've got some system updates
for my pebble watch I've got
successfully updated and you can just
drag up and down and see all of these
notifications it changes in here as well
now if I also had my notification bar up
on top you would see that those icons
are also changing their getting
highlighted the ones that I'm selected
on so it's easier to see and really easy
to get to here I've got my continuous
notification for my pebble watch quick
shout out to the michael fisher have a
watch face there i'll have a link for
that over at the article pocketnow.com
just for fun but back over here really
cool the halo metaphor for just getting
notifications and swapping through them
very nice very fast especially when
you've got this really cool pop-up
application to get what you need done
quickly fast without going in and
changing your context out of whatever
you were working in before it makes
going back to where you were really
quick really easy the main place you're
going to like this is if you have any
social networks that have a timeline
you're not going to lose your place in
your timeline when you go and reply to a
gmail in the early days of custom roms
cyanogenmod was the realm of choice
today it's stable
and across tons and tons of devices but
if you want to have novel and unique
features paranoid android is where it's
at if you liked what you saw here why
not give the video a thumbs up and share
it with your friends on your favorite
social networking site we're on all them
and we have links down below if you want
to follow me on twitter i'm at joe levi
if you have questions or comments please
leave them in the comments area down
below for pocket now showing off all
kinds of cool stuff in paranoid android
the custom rom i'm joe levi thanks for
watching if you like what these just
like this one the holo launcher halo
