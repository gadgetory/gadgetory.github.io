seems like forever wireless charging is
finally starting to arrive I'm Joe Levi
for pocket now and we're going to take a
look at wireless charging pads from
energizer and Nokia before we get
started it's important to know that both
of these support the Qi standard Qi is
spelled Qi just in case you were
wondering if you have a wireless device
or a device that charges wirelessly
rather you also need to support that
standard luckily I have a nexus 4 and
sure enough it supports this standard
all you have to do is drop it on the pad
little LED lights up and sure enough it
is charging same thing over here with
the Nokia drop it and sure enough it
starts charging so let's take a look at
some of the similarities and differences
like we mentioned they follow the same
standard that's great right now the
costs are about the same this guy cost
me about 55 bucks this one cost about 60
your availability is limited and that's
really going to drive your prices some
differences this is a very glossy very
slippery surface and as you can tell it
is a wedge we talked about this before
in our hands-on with this device that
means if you've got a slippery device
like a nexus 4 and you set it on there
it's going to slide right off as you can
see it doing now eventually it's going
to stop charging you're gonna wake up in
the morning and you're not gonna have a
charged phone and that's not very cool a
couple ways around that first of all you
can get the bumper for your nexus 4 you
pop that on and it doesn't slide much
anymore or you can do what I've been
doing and that's take your bumper stick
it under there like that and it works
great not the intended purpose but ok so
it's goofy over here on the Nokia it's a
lot smaller and because it's smaller
it's a little bit more difficult to
position the phone onto it and have it
charge now this is not the intended
device for this charger but because it
is a Qi standard any Qi standard phone
should work one nice thing about this in
addition to its more compact sizes it's
got
little raised and somewhat grippy ring
in the middle so when you put your
device on there it does have some level
of grip you can see I'm holding that at
somewhat of an angle if I can get that
better on camera for you and it's it's
all done pretty well I mean it's not
perfect but and there just just proved
my point but hey it grips a lot better
it doesn't slide off I've never had that
problem how do they perform that's where
things get really interesting
both of these charge wirelessly charging
wirelessly takes a little bit more time
than charging via a hardwire how much
longer
over here on the Energizer it's usually
about ten percent longer to it to get a
full charge I mean that's okay because
the only place that I use is is here at
home and or rather f-d-a pocket now home
studio in Utah but I'm just leaving it
there overnight I have plenty of time
this is the one that I have at the
remote office and it just doesn't like
to charge you can see I've got a little
charging indicator LED down at the
bottom but I can't see that when my
device is on top of it I don't know that
it's charging unless that charging led
the notification LED on the front of the
Nexus 4 is on which it isn't all the
time this will very frequently go into a
rapid flash mode rapid flash means it's
not charging right something's wrong you
reset by taking off put it back this guy
takes about an extra 10 percent longer
its charge then this guy does the
Energizer's a bit quicker than the Nokia
at least with the Nexus 4 in my
experience the the Nokia charger just
isn't quite as good now that's because
it's a lot smaller
I believe it probably has a smaller
inductive coil then the Energizer
version does though I haven't torn them
down to verify that it just seems like
there's a smaller target space for you
to try and hit next if you're using the
bumper for your Nexus 4 you're going to
run into a little bit of a problem
because it tries to fit right over the
edges so if you get one edge up and one
edge off you're not necessarily going to
have that connection so when you're
using the know if you try and use
just regular like that now of course if
you have a Nokia phone like the Lumia
920 that has this t inductive charging
built-in or I pronounced it wrong again
how about that this Qi charging built-in
this is the device that you want for it
and it works great other devices that
also support the standard possibly not
so much in summary I like them both I
like the Energizer a bit better I hate
the fact that it's a wedge and the phone
slides off of it but I would still go
and buy each one of these again or
rather I would buy either one of them
again if I were you I probably wouldn't
buy both I'd have one in one location
and one in another have one at your you
know your day job and have one at home
so that you can just keep your phone
topped off and charged up whenever you
want you don't have to worry about
plugging and unplugging you just set it
down and you don't have to worry about
it really the technology is very cool I
like it quite a bit I think we're going
to see more and more of this wireless
charging as days and weeks and months go
on but now I want to know what you think
have you tried wireless charging if so
what are your experiences what chargers
have you used let us know in the
comments over at pocketnow.com while
you're at it
why not share this video if you liked it
with your friends on Facebook Twitter
and Google+ we're in all three places
and if you want to follow me on Twitter
I'm at Joe Levi for pocket now showing
off wireless chargers thanks for
