as many would like to call it
iPhone day and if you want the extra
mile to wake up at midnight Pacific on
pre-order day then one or two boxes
should have arrived at your doorstep I'm
hanging out any better with pocket now
and let's unbox the Apple watch Series
three with Cellular
so yes I actually received two products
today both the Apple watch Series 3 and
the regular-sized iPhone 8 we don't want
to bore you with two identical and
boxing's of the iPhone so I'm gonna let
my pal Juan Carlos back now tell you
more about the iPhone 8 plus unboxing
the product I've been really looking
forward to most is the Apple watch
series 3 you'd think that it's because
of the LTE but actually it's not
I ordered LTE just to give you the full
review treatment but I'm mostly
interested in testing apples claim on
calling this the ultimate fitness watch
you know I like to put claims to the
real world test and hey I also need to
get myself back in shape unboxing Apple
watches is a real treat
I believe in box the product with a
pull-tab on the external shipping box
tucked inside is a significantly large
box in white and text to reveal the
goods I love apples attention to detail
Apple watch in black text series 3 in
red we then peel the plastic cover and
the box lights from the top underneath
we've got the larger-than-life
literature you'll most likely ignore but
what I don't recommend that you ignore
is the small replacement strap if you've
got small wrists and then beneath that
there is the Apple watch series three
accessories included are just the
wireless charging book that connects the
USB wall adapter and that's about it and
how about if we pull it out of the
plastic
I love the sound of that
as usual I always buy the silver 42
millimeter Apple watch it's just easier
to find third-party replacement bands
for silver just like in series 2 we've
got ceramic at the bottom which I highly
praise and there is a red accent on the
digital crown to tell you that you're
using a cellular variant for those of
you that have been following us for
years you know that series 1 was a
complete disappointment for me I like
series 2 for its approach to fitness but
hated how clunky was in launching
applications apple claims that series 3
is going to fix all that whether that's
true or not will be revealed in our full
review which begins at the gym later
today well that happens remember our
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus coverage has
also begun
