good looking screen and a nice profile
yep we do have the Oppo Reno 10 times
zoom finally in the house
this is poking out and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody I
wanted to give you some quick thoughts
as I start testing the Opel Reno 10
times zoom okay so at first glance this
is a very shiny device it's got a
wonderful blue hue and this nice little
pattern on the bottom that shows you
designed by Oppo it definitely is
there's even the little nub at the top
there with a green line around it that I
actually find pretty fun to kind of pick
at what I'm just holding the phone like
this it's where the fingerprint reader
probably is supposed to be but instead
it is right here underneath the display
it works really well now I've already
done a hands-on video for this so you
probably know a few of my thoughts about
the phone but I'm excited to be able to
use it on the daily now especially for
that camera array now here's the thing I
did do a real-world camera test with
what was supposed to be a pre-production
unit and that's over on my channel
youtube.com slash Josh or Vergara if you
want to see some examples of what this
camera can do then you can head over to
that video as well but there are still
some quirks on here that remain after
that initial railroad camera test so
maybe some updates are going to happen
for example you still can't use the
other lenses when using video there's
another phone that kind of has this
let's say problem and that is the 1 + 7
Pro it would have been nice to get more
in the frame by using the wide-angle
lens or to get more dramatic shots by
using the telescopic 5 x zoom lens right
here in order to get closer into the
frame into the scene for a more dramatic
shot this is not a vs. with the 1 + 7
Pro but I just wanted to point out that
I did notice the front-facing camera
while the field of view is kind of the
same when it comes to photos it
definitely crops in a lot more on the 1
+ 7 Pro for somebody that does vlogs and
I like to do on-camera segments quite
often on smartphones the wider angle is
definitely more appreciated on the Oppo
Reno 10 times zoom so as you might
imagine I went kind of crazy with the
front-facing camera I took quite a few
selfies a little party that I went to
for Memorial Day and also did a little
bit of video with it that you can see
right now one final comparison point I
want to make with the 1 + 7 Pro it's
just the phone that we saw last so that
I keep thinking about it
well the curve
the 1 plus 7 probe is on the screen and
that is so they can squeeze a little bit
more display onto this phone and that's
perfectly fine
but the curve on the Oppo Reno 10 times
zoom is on the back which means that
it's it's a little bit more comfortably
in the hand now both of these phones
have similar footprints they look very
similar in terms of screen size I have
gone on record as to say that the 1 + 7
Pro is a load to big of a phone I still
believe that and I also believe that of
the elbow Reno but this is a tiny bit
more comfortable that front-facing
camera is also used for what Oppo has
done a great job with and that is facial
recognition facial recognition on oppa
phones tends to be the most fun because
their camera designs are a little more
elaborate than your typical pop up in
this case it's what we call the shark's
fin I know that that's not the official
name for it but I can't help it if
that's what it looks like and personally
I love it that the phone practically
raises an eyebrow at me in order to see
if it's really me the screen is a
beautiful AMOLED display at full HD plus
resolution I've already used it for a
lot of games and also for a lot of
YouTube viewing the speakers are also
really impressive
speaking of gaming the Oppo Reno 10x
zoom does have what looks to be a trend
in many flagship smartphones the game
space now the game space is basically
where you can have all of your apps or
rather your games in one place that way
they're easy to easy to launch there are
a few extra features and one that's
greatly appreciated is the ability to
block the banner so that they don't
cover up your gameplay aside from that
there's also a performance setting that
you can have in either balanced lower
consumption if you want to elongate your
play time or into a competitive mode
that ups the performance and also the
frame rate and responsiveness of the
game in the phone at the cost of a
little bit of battery life so I've had
this for a few days now and those are
the experiences that I've had so far on
the Oppo Reno 10x zoom I am still going
to put this camera through its paces
there are a number of things I'm gonna
be doing over the next couple of weeks
where this wide angle and this
periscoping zoom are going to come in
really handy especially for photos
because obviously you can't use those
lenses and video and so there you have
it some quick thoughts early on with the
Oppo Reno 10x zoom this is an exciting
device because it's putting a lot of the
tropes we're seeing in flagship devices
into one really unique looking package
it's take on the pop up camera it looks
different that's cool it has the
periscope being
camera lens that allows for a ten times
total zoom without loss of clarity
that's cool a fingerprint reader inside
of a good-looking AMOLED display that's
cool too
all right so just wanted to make sure
you knew we had the Oppo Reno ten times
zoom in hand once I put the camera
through its paces and also use this as a
proper daily driver so I can give you
some insights on battery life and
whatnot I will give you my full review
but until then I'm going to go ahead and
call it on this one thank you so much
for watching subscribe to pocket now if
you haven't already and drop some likes
on all of these videos so we know you
like what we're doing get into the
comment sections and have some
discussions about all of the stuff we're
talking about these days and yeah that
should pretty much do it I'm gonna call
it on this one and we will see you in
our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
