and we learn what changes we get more
leaks and claims of what to expect with
the galaxy s6 edge and Apple is already
working on new uses for touch ID I'm hi
I'm Eddie Vetter and the guys thank you
all very much for your birthday wishes I
read all of them this is pocket out
daily let's begin today with what's
official if you thought that blackberry
was dead it sort of is but not
necessarily the company has just
launched its blackberry classic
smartphone and if it looks identical to
every previous blackberry before it
that's because it is we really haven't
covered blackberry news in a long time
but this blackberry classic phone looks
like the original bold 9900 and even
though it's running its blackberry 10
operating system there are some very
interesting changes position to better
support for Android applications look so
those are full details and
specifications I'll talk about Google as
I know many of you still don't have
Android 5.0 lollipop but I think again
if you are expecting it because 5.1
seems to be just around the corner and
this is going to be very different to
jelly bean jelly bean every dot one
update was a major upgrade and he
apparently we're only getting a couple
of changes like better RAM management a
better ok Google response in addition to
other changes when it comes to the
silent mode which are really interesting
changes but again all minor expected for
January it seems now let's talk about
Samsung and mobile payments as
apparently the company is already
working on getting into the business but
this time with a very different
technology from a company called Luke
pay apparently they're gonna be
licensing the technology and the idea is
that lupe is special because you don't
need NFC to use it but the question
being is what's the point of almost
every Android smartphone right now has a
machine apparently that's going to be
the big selling point and hopefully this
is not just another samsung gimmick but
we'll see up next let's talk about Apple
this time let's talk about touch ID we
have some very interesting patterns that
were just revealed the choice that the
company is looking for new uses for
touch ID necessarily just unlocking your
phone apparently they are looking into
finger gestures that you could use a
touch ID sensor like for example sliding
to the right left or whatever in a way
that will allow you to have more usage
of the button than just pressing it or
locking your phone but sadly patents for
Apple are not necessarily guarantees
let's see if we ever get it and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
let's talk about some samsung galaxy s6
rumors first of all remember apparently
the phone will be launched early next
year so early it probably won't be mwc
but apparently even though we've heard
of so many variants of the galaxy s6 the
most interesting one today is that there
are more possibilities of this phone
being an edge smartphone you know a
galaxy s6 edge than anything else now
we're not sure that this is just a
variance for specific regions but we
didn't know that the company does need
to change things even though we're not
sure those edge designs are going to
make it any better and that really leads
me to the question of the day what a
galaxy s6 edge meaning that's the only
variant that's going to be launched if
that were the design would you buy it
because in my case I still find the edge
to be a gimmick but leave us a comment
down below probably you don't renji know
