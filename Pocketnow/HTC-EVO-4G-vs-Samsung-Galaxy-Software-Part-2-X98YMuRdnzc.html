now calm and this next video is going to
be part 2 of our software comparison of
the HTC evo 4g to the samsung galaxy s
we're going to show you some in-depth
coverage of navigating the general home
screen playing some games such as
asphalt five as well as the YouTube
application so let's go ahead and kick
that off one popular discussion topic
when it comes to android are the amount
of homescreens a person or a user can
have now HTC Sense here will give me
seven screens you can see here I can
swipe all the way over we have one two
three four five six seven and yes as you
saw i'm currently not using those i had
widgets on there but i took them off to
be fair with the speed the Samsung
Galaxy S will give you the exact same
amount of screens however you can only
scroll from the left to the right you
cannot go both ways as you can see here
we're on screen one here is screen too
we keep moving so on and so forth all
the way up to number seven so they will
be comparable in that sense one of the
main things that really stuck out to me
was HTC Sense has a friend column here I
can actually scroll through and call on
my friends is almost like a speed dial
the samsung galaxy s uses that same type
of idea and Samsung's overlay where they
have what's called a buddies now which
it's actually kind of cool-looking you
can actually flick through here and
actually kind of like a pinwheel get to
your contacts gives you the option to
message them message them or call them
right from there so they both
incorporate some of the same aspects in
that sense as you can see we have the
quick buttons for the 4g the Wi-Fi so on
and so forth just like every other
Android device you have the power
manager on the Samsung Galaxy that is
one of the Android widgets so those are
some of the similarities in terms of the
home screen navigation now HTC Sense has
this giant flip clock with the weather
built right in I'm using beautiful
widgets here to actually give me the
same effect now next up we're going to
test the YouTube application on each of
these two devices now it is the same
application however there may be a
different load time based on the fact
that they are using a different CPU and
a different GPU so what we do right now
is going to go ahead and test it out I'm
going to up YouTube at the same time
and I'm going to turn them both into
landscape mode so that I can help up a
video and show you side-by-side or
better yet top to bottom now once again
samsung galaxy s is here evo 4g is here
and we're going to pick a pocket now
video and i'm going to do the motorola
droid x unboxing so the same exact time
i must elect both of these and it looks
like the samsung galaxy s started
playing faster one thing to keep in mind
there though is the evo is actually
playing the HQ version as you can see
the HQ is highlighted right here with
that being said the screen difference is
astounding here it really shows itself
off in terms of these super amoled
versus the LCD just the color accuracy
the color saturation the evil really
does look washed out unfortunately
compared to this once again though the
evo is playing it in the high quality or
the samsung galaxy s by default is not
next up we're also going to take a look
at the software keyboard inch these two
devices now what's nice one android is
you can customize and skin a lot of the
different aspects of the operating
system including the keyboard however
the default keyboards really go a long
way with some devices and on some other
devices they really need some
improvement we're going to open up
handcent SMS which is what i use on all
my android devices and we'll start a new
message here and as you can see in terms
of the keyboard the HTC evos keyboard is
much much bigger it's also going to
incorporate those arrows i personally
like the HTC evos keyboard much better
it's easier for me to type the fact that
the keys are actually together makes a
little bit easier for me to just glad my
fingers across the screen and type of a
text message very quickly where's with
the Samsung Galaxy S I find myself
making typos a lot more often than I do
on the EVO however the orientation is
nice it's still very similar a lot of
phones they'll change the orientation
some phones especially with the hardware
keyboards will actually bring the
spacebar from the middle here and put it
on the side the right side which doesn't
make a lot of sense to me so at least
that is kept consistent here last but
not least I want to test some of the
gameplay capabilities of each of these
two devices side by side and what I'm
actually going to do that with is going
to be the game asphalt five now the
Samsung Galaxy S comes with the full
version of
five pre-loaded on the device already
whereas in the evo I have the free
version of asphalt five now the quick
race function or the option I would say
in the game itself is identical so
that's actually I'm going to test the
game out itself will kind of see how the
frame rate is how the graphics look that
sort of things let's go ahead and
actually start these up identically at
the same time and I'm actually put them
in landscape mode and I'm going to try
and play them on camera holding them
both at the same time because they do
use the accelerometer to steer so it's
gonna be a little difficult but i am
going to give it a shot again we have
the quick race option here was what
we're actually going to do now the
reason why the galaxy right jumped ahead
is i already have a default car selected
which was that mini cooper type cars you
saw i'm just going to wait for both
these together to load and they're going
to go ahead and get off to the races so
i'm gonna go ahead and tap these at the
same time i'll let you be the judge once
again the colors do look a little better
on these samsung galaxy s itself
I would honestly say it's a little hard
for me to because I'm trying to steer
with both these at the same time and
they're a little bit of a difference but
I would just say that by default here I
was kind of let it run the frame rate on
the galaxy s seems to be a little more
saw a little more consistent to me I
would say it's a higher frames per
second I would say in terms with a
graphical detail it looks pretty much
the same you know that the colors are
one thing that's the difference in the
screen itself but I would say overall
the frame rate seems much smoother at
least to me on these samsung galaxy s as
you can see they're just actually locked
up on the samsung galaxy s now that I
look at it also the car itself that I'm
driving on the Samsung Galaxy S which is
the top phone does seem to be more
detailed a little bit shinier so I would
say the graphics are the GPU the samsung
galaxy s definitely seems a little
better due to that the software some of
the games such as asphalt five here runs
actually better on the device itself and
that's going to do it for our software
comparisons of the HTC evo 4g against
the samsung galaxy s as always guys
