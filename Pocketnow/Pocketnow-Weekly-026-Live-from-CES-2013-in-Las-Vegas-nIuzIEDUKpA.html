weekly live from Las Vegas it's episode
0 to 6 and the special CES edition of
the pocket now weekly podcast the once
week series from pocketnow.com where we
discuss the awesome and the awful in the
world of mobile technology I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket
now and joining me this broadcast
overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and a
very enticing in and out burger in the
distance from the luxor hotel at CES the
Consumer Electronics Show 2013 our
Brandon minimun and Jaime Rivera good
morning to you gentlemen I you sir good
morning yes we've been having us such a
ball and we are continuing to have a
ball this is so weird isn't it way you
can see each other this is weird I feel
Mary Lou's the way put off you feel very
gassy oh please please leave the room I
think I need to be perfect i was about
to say i'm gassy in my country is not we
just go outside take care of people come
that'll give me a chance to have some
teddy you're gonna completely love got
it you're gonna completely annihilate
the microphone just break it outside
yeah my very sensitive very sensitive to
that this is so we're we're we've all
become hundreds of miles to come here
for CSI came from Boston I made from
Honduras and brandon from the pocket now
headquarters deep underneath rural
Pennsylvania pocket out complex and it's
been an interesting show this is only
the second time we've ever done a
podcast were some of us where we can see
each other the first time being a TF 0
and Tony and I did are shirtless podcast
from the from the room I think John I
was no we said that every set it on the
air that was good but if you're if you
have to pass never on Iran there's a no
pants podcast but the important takeaway
from all that is that well it is really
nothing it's really was just just filler
we're getting getting to enjoy one
anothers
hi my voice is terrible yeah it's not
your fault because my voice is also
terrible we're all suffering from this
desert air which is the driest we've
ever encountered and you know when I was
are going to healthy yeah yeah yeah we
will we'll survive I've been this is
only my second a trade show ever and
this is what you guys is like in 21st or
something like that so I'm still reeling
from the level of activity my fourth CES
and this was definitely the most
organized of them all because we were
well oiled on our team yeah yeah we just
got so many videos done I think any did
me eye contact with the microphone is
this no I was like a peculiar staring at
this like a large don't say what you say
what it don't say what we said in a
pretty shitty unica listeners by the way
there's a blue Yeti so is it amazing
like just just looking at it really is
you can be standing like in another
hotel and it would pick up the audio is
clearly it's not the black thing is he
staring at the microphone and
complaining if you see the shape of the
microphone you'll understand why yeah it
looks like it looks like a big vitamin
capsule check check Twitter to see how
Michael refer to it oh yeah if you
haven't been following our Twitter you
should listen til the end of the show
for our Twitter handles but if you have
not listened to the show before this is
some for some reason your first time
listen to the talking I weekly
understand that we only do audio
podcasts so it is very strange for us to
be in the same room but let's let's talk
about the show a little bit because I
feel like CES my first CES was frankly a
bit of a letdown from a hardware
perspective and I woke up this morning
reading some stories some wrap up
stories this is the last day of the show
but people are already writing wrap ups
and they're talking about how this CES
had some of the least amount of hardware
in history what last year you said to 18
teen launched six devices here six
devices out of which they only have like
three on the show floor okay and you
could pay you really had to dig I mean
last year it was it was ok but if you
see my wrap-up of last year was I was
disappointed as well we I was expecting
tablets that were pretty much over there
was pretty much only one tablet which
was waterproof and I could never find
right from paying the pantech yeah I
don't know it wasn't vaporware it wasn't
something interesting but there was a
lot of vapor were a lot of devices that
were announced their concepts and they
never saw the light of day and that's
last year you're talking about that's
2012 I would have killed for that this
year that sounds perfect that sounds
awesome to me this year because this
remedy just don't want to share the
spotlight they want anyone do their own
event yeah and frame it themselves like
they want to host you host you at their
own thing it's a weird it's weird
because they're kind of obligated to
show something but they don't want to
pop their big guns right except for Sony
which is very strange and the show
almost has become about Sony in the last
couple of years where they announced
their their their awesome products
because they don't really so you don't
really do those big events right I did
there are like big self-contained events
now it's certainly not in America I'd
never met a really good mwc event last
year um and what they have well they
launched the Xperia S the Xperia I'm our
names the Xperia family of letter were
three experience no tablets mentioned um
and it was a really good event yeah very
well organized very and they delivered
you know no but yeah so nice we took a
really good spotlight this year but then
when you look at the other companies
that were used to seeing a CS like
Microsoft or r example nokia had a
really good event last year and they had
nothing Lisi they weren't even there
like they had a press room there to
press room in a cocktail party and
that's about it okay yeah yeah it's this
is a very you know it's just kind of
interesting because if you look at the
event schedules you'll see that almost
everything is about mobile like what
Monday and Tuesday is all full of mobile
right but still these companies just
came up with me or announcements no real
nothing really substantial nothing
really big and it's just kind of
interesting I mean you don't see like
car announcements or anything even if
CES actually goes all the way to Friday
yeah and I want to talk about that first
thing because Samsung I feel like was
the biggest example of that because we
team listeners listen this is what
happened it's cars honking outside
somebody out somebody outside something
24 s below is really connected somebody
heard me sing Oh Kim that's why they're
here comes the helicopter they got sorry
run run yeah no but the thing is uh we
were we split our team up pretty
logically on the day that Samsung had
their big announcement nobody knew what
Samsung is going to announce but the
huawei announcement was almost
essentially at the same time so we had
to split up her forces
and I tweeted about two days ago that
like two and a half hours before the
Samsung event the line had already
started outside the doors yeah and so
I'm like guys we gotta get in line so we
all took turns like holding our position
in line and when the time came to the
huawei announcement where you and I hi
man went down went down the hall to go
to go cover that and Brandon stayed in
line and so so I mean I recovering the
huawei announcement and we're like
sneaking hands on before the CEO even
speaks and actually our ascend mate
hands on gets cut short because of a
woman who was well within her rights to
do so it was like you need to sit down
gentlemen you need to love the phone and
sent it was the phone I was like here we
keep it did you really want to keep her
though later right we will but isn't so
anyway we stayed the huawei device the
announcement we're trying to leave and
finally it wraps up just before the
samsung thing starts we run down the
hallway the line has already started
moving into the samsung wrapped around
like seven times oh it's the most
ridiculous it's like a concert line i
mean it's ridiculous yeah i'm really
trying to understand Samson's mentality
this year of doing a first come first
serve mm-hmm in a trade show that is so
vast I mean and and their infants those
frickin refrigerators and they know
they're gonna be the superstars yeah
they do refrigerators they do TVs they
do freaking microwaves so just think
about how many different categories of
journalists we're trying to get in there
that's a good call I'm look really good
that the line was so exact and I think
that's exactly why yeah I think this was
all about the theatrics a milking the
cow absolutely are you know the end
result was that we couldn't get in
because brenda was already in the door
we were getting shuffled hi men are
getting run from line two lines like oh
yeah go in the back I'll go in this way
go in the VIP line whatever by the time
we get to the doors like the doors are
all closed the doors were walking and
again like every time they open the door
to try and let new people in like people
would fall out it's so like the room was
insanely Packard probably was illegally
packed i'm sure it was over capacity
looks like he's yeah and well I you know
citation needed whatever but we couldn't
get in and we were so bummed and we
started uploading videos from the wild
wave NY like whatever and then we're
talking to Brandon via text message and
like we lost you for a little bit really
anything cool happening and what
happened in there they they talk about
their 4k TVs which is cool then they
talked about a refrigerator a
washer/dryer android-powered toast an
android-powered toaster but it's
upgradable key lime pie oh and border
ready no but actually Samsung in a
really big announcement today there
there XO knows what is it called oh
there dude auto cocteau max 88 there
eight core shift which does something
really cool with the architecture I
don't know acting like I know it I'm
what I'm talking about chip architecture
it's got a its got two sets of four
cores one ra seven core is one hour a15
cores and and obviously the a 15 or
higher performance are the ones that are
used for I look at the microphone I see
that the a15 cores are used for hire you
know CPU intensive stuff like 3d gaming
then the a7 stuff is used for the second
set of four chords is used for you know
email and web browsing and so forth so
the idea is that probably most of time
eighty percent of the time you're going
to be using the a7 cores and samsung
claims that it's seventy percent more
power efficient than the CPU found in
the keynote to in the galaxy s3 so this
is going to be a badass chip wow it's
gonna be fast and it's gonna it's gonna
really good power to them you know in
the past night I've made this mistake or
a terrible assumption I was like why are
we getting what core processor on
smartphones I mean even even if we and I
thought the same about ulti I was like
what's the point about having LT if for
tethering it does make sense but what's
the point about having so much speed of
the browser is not really capable of
pushing a speedier navigation process
and as it turns out well the eight core
is a solution but you know one thing
that I've learned about using more
powerful computers is that they are more
power efficient aside from being more
power efficient Anthony yeah so I mean
for example we're rocking a Retina
Display MacBook Pro right now for all
our video referee last year we did
everything with to MacBook Airs and it
was insane it wouldn't normally take
much longer but the computers would just
go berserk after like about an hour no
more power batteries were dead no
outlets and I didn't have that same
problem with Retina Display MacBook Pro
and so that proves to the point that
eight cores
or more course will definitely make the
amount of stress on on the device much
lower and therefore it does make sense
for it to be more powerful especially as
mobile devices become more and more
prominent as primary devices exactly
yeah and and then Qualcomm invidia also
announced their new chips the the Tegra
4 oh right the Tegra 4 them much more
difficult to remember qualcomm
snapdragon 200 400 and 600 800 right all
right let's 200-400 order here that's
and they used to be called the s4 and
something else yeah like a 737 something
so so so yeah we tried to Qualcomm
announced its new passenger aircraft
good so you know of course these
companies had reference hard were there
but you know Brandon broken I do that to
everything it's so funny because the
woman at the nvidia stand was like this
is reference hardware you know we're
showing a web demo and i'm like i don't
care i just want to go in and out of
apps and film it for people right and
she's like I don't think you can do that
and there and then it was locked down
and then and then the password hint was
7777 so i type seven seven seven seven
seven seven seven and then see it's all
in your aircraft right it isn't triple
seven all right well brandon types in
the code to get in to get past the lock
screen and like that's when she finally
she was being so nice and to accommodate
any forensics i told she's like no no
she was like Consuela family guy for a
second there no no no then it was like
okay Brandon was very good Brendan was
like ok alright are you know I had to
try yeah so we got this pot calm stuff
on video and they showed asphalt 7 which
is terrible on every device except the
iphone 5 literally every device but it
was actually pretty good on this android
tablet running a calm Snapdragon 800 3
by 3 4 by 4 whatever you know yeah 730
central prompt boost and I'm like I'm
work at the camera for this video and
I'm like I both both both processor
tests and these racing games do nothing
for me so i'm like falling asleep i'm
holding up the camera until brandon like
like goes back to the home screen and it
indeed the developer device like auto
rotates from landscape to portrait and I
guess
they they didn't account for that so
like they couldn't get it back okay will
so like thirty percent of Qualcomm's
like you you know demo devices are now
broken and the guys like the one of the
guy say you know yes never come back
never show your face it Logan it we
gotta get enough video just despite
breaking yet another device pretty much
yeah and we we asked the guy like why is
this called something so you know the s4
pro such good you know notoriety the
brand is so strong wrong it's an SCP on
the market right now and they you know
they have the s4 prime for TVs they
should call it like the s4 pro two and
people would love that people like
iterative numbers things that go up
counting yeah motorola droid razr m or
glt yeah evo 4g LTE is super epic uh
what's a long exactly ever that we it
was it was that is the galaxy s2 on
sprint yeah is that epic was prancing
sprint samsung sprint samsung galaxy s2
epic 4g touch yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway
so yeah we're always we spend a lot of
time with with with processors and
russell yes son I guess that is cool and
that's one of those things that it's so
difficult to get excited about on the
surface cuz you know as geeks you want
like all right getting let me see a new
device let me see something completed
let me see let me play with it and it's
a little harder to look further down the
road sometimes and see why this stuff is
important but it is but um there wasn't
a total lack of devices as we said like
what while Brandon was busy getting
getting the first whiffs of the Samsung
connected refrigerator and all that kind
of stuff I mean ever literally as
Twitter on the refrigerator is Twitter
so stupid I don't get Twitter later on
you're not being sarcastic re know you
like to look legitimate late like look
serious okay legitimately the
refrigerator is Twitter on it has at
just twitter is facebook it's it's so
dumb like a would stand in front of the
refrigerator and flip through their
tweets like like if i do i'm carrying a
tablet to do it this is the same reason
I couldn't get excited about the
connected car thing we so we attended
the ATT developers how many we saw you
know that their first of all that's
ridiculous AT&amp;amp;T is is trying to do this
thing with with connected cars and
connected homes and bridge by ridiculous
I don't mean to be disparaging
I mean it's pretty cool the connected
homes was a good idea like but AT&amp;amp;T is
trying to digital life right it was
really good 18 teens and I don't those
teddy grahams are gonna make it on the
air one way or the other yeah that but
it would ATT is is not just doing things
that are you know exclusively mobility
exclusively communications they're doing
like home security now his verizon is
and in the and they're both trying to
uproot it like ADT but 18 he's gonna
have call centers like ATT is gonna have
buildings that it owns with people
inside whose job it is to watch your
house they're all gonna be basing on
Buddhist haha is it but isn't it crazy I
mean I think of eighteen t is my
communications provider I don't
necessarily think that oh these are the
guys I want you know guarding my front
door with electronics and not that I
don't it's just uh you know a disconnect
to my head it went surprisingly of ATT
bought a movie studio I mean we're
seeing like these communication
companies comcast you know Owens movie
studios on infrastructure and why
because they care because I can their
new rich and maybe when they go through
cellular somehow right I mean so
it's all about controlling our our our
you know our devices are using our
devices to enhance our IP and we're just
gonna be all right that's true so so
devices that's a well yeah let's talk so
this is why what I was saying was why I
couldn't get excited about connected
cars because listen I've got a tablet
with me anyway I don't need a monitor in
the backseat of my but I don't have kids
or whatever that's that was a whole
thing we did see some devices though and
what we had to do was we had to focus on
every single manufacturer that we that
we could so that we could bring you guys
the listeners and readers and Watchers
all the device coverage that you like
and and maybe dislike and maybe actively
dislike in the comment and that's fun
because we've had some override had some
cool discussions in the in common
threads about particular devices so we
our first one was was on that day with
with Huawei and our first experience was
was seeing some new hardware from them
and they debuted their ascend d2 and you
and me to their ascend mate it was like
mate that sounds like frickin one animal
planet yeah I think there's a language
it's true there I mean I don't want to
phone the top the mate yeah imma mating
that you want I mean whatever would fit
what if it was like the ascend like
buddy
the Ascend like partner man they should
hire you you send a buddy that's a good
one why not if while we made her phone
called the Ascend buddy I would just buy
it out of principle I think you'd be
great but the mate is there note
competitor and it is it is a massive
massive device so so big its 6.1 inches
diagonal the screen size are you
picturing the phone I'm sure you are
yeah so so we don't get to talk about
this is this a phone the phone's very
thin it's it's it's relatively light
it's got a 720p screen and it's in a
massive battery it's guy how big sorry
four thousand milliamp hour thousand
million hours so it'll probably have
slightly better better than the note 2
goes it goes it depends on cough it
depends on how the software is optimized
and but they it's it's got the battery
life the bra milliamp hour rating is
paired with what do they call it stamina
so this is it's a 6.1 into instead the
six foot one who devised a lot of
stamina the thing about it is that i
think it was cool cuz it was it was
while way talking about their special
how stamina works cuz they it's not just
the airplane mode right it's not just
that it terminates mobile data to save
you power like you can you shut off
specific things yet that then you can
keep specific things active I don't know
it seems pretty cool don't don't devices
already do that like like smart actions
on motorola and stuff I yeah yeah there
are excellent there's another
manufacturer that was touting something
similar exactly yeah it doesn't it
doesn't do that much I mean at the end
of the day it's good if you have like
five percent left and you want to be
able to make a call in an hour that's
good yeah I think the tech the thicker
three started with the whole idea of
okay it has quad core processor but it
will only use one whenever you don't
need the rest of the time I think the
Tegra 3 only uses one core all the time
visit I know it's terrible but I mean
the concept that's like the perfect
concept you've got it course you're only
gonna use to use them dynamically yeah
yeah dynamically I think that's like the
best way to handle things I don't you
know stammen as nothing really new to
the market and I know my impressions on
this phablet were first of all yeah well
doesn't have a stylist first exactly is
it a phablet I mean like it is if we buy
a size
was but like it's not a note-taking
device right what value or is it is that
exercise bringing you know seriously
just competition and you know the the
CEO huawei was so you know I was really
becoming annoyed at the keynote because
he was like this is better than
competition and this is better than
competition yeah now this is better in
compensation and everything was better
than competition and the question is why
doesn't the phone cell better than
competition yeah and I think it's
because they're completely out of focus
even they need to say the better than
competition it's like how many had well
well we know that the mobile market is
full of people that are like my phone is
better than yours of course um that's
not the perception of Huawei I think
they really need to build a brand upon a
quality beauty some design the phones
were not badly designed by the way no
they didn't look bad but they didn't
blow us out of the water but they didn't
look bad I didn't look better yeah I
think they were they were well designed
I that's my impression I just feel that
they were completely out of focus
they're doing these phones to compete
but not really too wow anybody yes what
the what they mate will do is mate mate
with it will offer some people the
opportunity to have a phone that's
tremendously there's actually tremendous
yes tremendously tremendous are here
gets a lot of attention it's very hard
to do that I mean the note 2 has become
accepted I mean how many know tues do we
see how are you both have searched
everywhere here at the show everybody
and I use mine every day to because it's
a very good device for Cano y'all give
you a pia listeners I had never used a
note to be I hadn't held it before
everything and so Brandon brings me in
them to to this event you know I think
I've got the biggest hands on the room
and I see now we can easily see ok but
how we're doing and the heavy Saracen oh
oh that's exciting wrist oh I got this
much come here friends goes oh let me
see you and I heard like exactly tired
okay so we so we aim hands all right and
still I thought device feels humongous
him and that's the note 2 and that's
like for me the note 2 is a really thin
the device yeah the wrong with the mate
is that it was really big but it wasn't
really all that then no it's not it's a
little bulky to come to jail cell I just
I feel I feel it's gonna definitely be
like the most tremendous flop of the
year yeah and also I think those are
there's not a software optimization
on the on the on the on the huawei
software side because this thing is and
brenards got a picture of it now he's
kind of looking at it here and its
really really nice to be reminded of how
big this device really is now to me I
have to be honest I I would I love going
with you guys on that but it didn't feel
that big in my hand when I was doing
either of the two videos so it actually
I could see myself carrying it for a
little bit but honestly it's the
software optimizations that are that are
wanting for me because on the note 2
what was the last night we were leaving
an event i was using the note 2 to
navigate and i was like I want to be
surfing Twitter and Brendan was like
well I have to see the picture so we can
drive and I'm like oh wait kind of can
we do dual screen and I did I used multi
screen on the note 2 to navigate and to
serve my Twitter feed at the same time
and that kind of optimization that kind
of intelligent use of the bigger canvas
is what I think the ascent mate is
missing and that's what every phablet
should do I think I'll republish it to
everything Sampson is doing a very smart
thing with balance it's like is that the
it's a device that you don't need you
don't need the screen size unless the
manufacturer is capable of knowing what
to do with it mm-hmm plus there's some
value add and the endless there's gotta
be a reason for for for the
inconvenience of having such a large
phone in in some cases it is yes hey
it's funny because you guys are saying
how the the CEO of Huawei was like we do
this bedroom accommodation is better and
I was extremely it's like it's like the
kind of blind sometimes like um I was
playing with you yes n mate and this
hallway rep comes up to me and he shows
me with the most pride I've ever seen
anyone exude he showed me how in the
dialer you can switch to left-hander
right-handed mode like the Galaxy Note 2
out and it's like an obvious thing why
are you showing me this feature I mean
yes yeah it's you know I think there was
only one smart thing about that phone I
was that you can you could hide the the
navigation android games oh that is bad
oh yes that is badass so there you go
ahead got you're excited about your
emotions I love this app so so I like
phones that use the the virtual android
buttons because not only can you
customize them but it just it seems
cooler it makes for a buttonless design
it looks nice on the front absolutely
ascend d2 and they send to mate they
both have you can you can swipe it down
on the on the buttons and they disappear
so and then what happens then is that
the
takes over the full screen so you see it
kind of grow and take up you know
another 40 pixels or so is it it's a
little thing but it works so well and I
love it and if you want to bring it back
you just swipe up your bottom that's
awesome that actually and it's one of
the few things and I don't want to say a
few things it's a d thing to say but
it's like that's one of the things that
I huawei brought to the software side
where is like hey that's you can
innovate do you know that yeah it's a
small thing but do more of that yeah
exactly and then what I mean then the d2
wasn't anything terribly special it said
in a 55 inch flagship is 1080p which is
nice wasn't that the one where we can
count the frames are mean you were you
on the animation yeah I think that was
the z10 CT yeah I think I think it was
the d2 as well probably the frame rate
who suffers cuz Huawei has their own
custom Android skin as well she doesn't
even have trade seems oh right it's just
it's that mean it's that emotion UI is
that his name of the is a huawei skin
yeah that does it give you some sort of
positive on the way yeah it pisses me
off yeah that's what it does it pisses
me off because it works half the time
it's extremely sluggish mmm we had a
demo on that a tifo when Tony and I
interviewed one of the guys from well
way it was nice enough to give us a demo
on that and I think he was explaining
the philosophy behind that is like
they're eliminating the app tray to
simplify simplify and so they're making
an Android iPhone yeah that's what it
kind of feels like yeah you can swipe
back and forth bended you know your
folders all that kind of stuff but
there's no Brandon's like where's the
app launcher I'm like oh is this running
the you know in motion you are and then
which is based on em what have you
pronounce at ma mi UI the new me you I
give me you I it has a similar look and
feel and it's funny cuz why is that make
sense ZT devices also feel like me you I
shall we talk about the CTA devices she
go there yeah are very very helpful are
very helpful uh ZTE press representative
she's very tall she didn't see him fit
for the technical type job oh I I think
she did it great she had another
profession I think she is I think she
did a great job you believe n roll alone
Sosa CD has the SD cool the grand s your
the grand king
I don't think I think she was the night
she was hidden lighters I don't know if
she'd by the way listeners it's the
description says Graham King us because
that's what they told us well that's
what they told us it was on the but
those well if you look at the booth
there was really no description of the
device there was no description the spec
card it was just there was nothing just
a row of unlabeled devices were like
what is this a day now it's very
confusing yeah so so that's their
flagship and it's funny it's very very
similar to the ascend d2 it's got the s4
pro it's got two gigabytes Ram 5-inch
screen 1080p display a me you I like I
mean they're almost identical except the
the zg e devices much thinner and it's
pretty I think it's it's it's pretty
good it's not a bad looking device
that's the weirdest lockscreen I've ever
seen yeah I can't understand right yeah
I do if you watch our video we struggle
with that for a second yeah emerald was
trying to help you out at that point I
was like oh yeah no let me just get in
here to you press and hold on the lock
button and a little lightning bug like
draws a circle around your thumb and
then it unlocks if you hold it long
enough interesting is pretty cool smart
yeah smart and then of you could slide
two different applications if you want
to slide from the lock screen all right
or just press and hold and it'll unlock
the phone that was cool yeah and then it
had that little movable dock that you
liked in the video right the little
button doc I'll free the homewagon I
didn't actually like that you you make
some of that I may do it I'll be on you
don't like it I don't understand when
you would use it the CD device has this
like little dot thing that pops up on
the screen on one of the sides and if
you pull out the dot you get the android
buttons sort of wherever the dot is like
a home and task switcher and so forth
and you can turn it off but it's strange
because you have the buttons just a few
inches down below why would you want
them why would you want a home button in
the center of the screen that's a good
point so yeah but it was cool to see cuz
it worked well yeah just you know take
the time right and so and so the ZTE
device like the huawei do i was choppy
and pretty laggy pretty slow it's not a
device i would want to carry although
it's coming to the u.s. in 23 / 10 now
and I face up the end of 2013 well they
said by the end of 2013 I mean they said
sometime in 20-30 they also said they
were in talks with a major carrier and I
think you know you I don't think that
thing will be priced very high because
et is still very entry level in the
States and yes
if it comes out you know after galaxy s4
after right but m7 but I think it has
the potential to be an interesting 1080p
entry level the right little 1080p like
maybe the first entry level 1080p device
is awesome it would be cool can I like
that a lot of go bones 400 bucks that
would be yeah right right anyways et's
give me a stomachache yeah come here
move on yeah that's sony let's talk
about sony 0 sony's booth was it was it
was not even Busoni had a gymnasium and
when you walk into the place you're
surrounded by this what i can only
describe as like a like a giant version
of a blindfold it's like a wraparound
screen that's maybe what was it about 15
15 feet high and just encompass the
entire space had like 10 projectors oh
is it was absurdly cool and you're most
of the time during while we're doing the
demos were surrounded by these like
moving ribbons of color yeah and they
know how to do put on a show they know
how to put on a show geez I think they
did it much better than mwc last year
they had this arm that was just so
annoying it sounded like a one of those
Japanese Mongoose have you ever heard
that music room from like it go you have
it no I barely have a voice that yeah
questions when I feel that they put on a
good show I you know I like the focus
that I saw at Sony CEO yes which I
didn't see at mwc wit when he was
recently appointed okay no time he was
he's grabbing the company they're doing
away with Sony Ericsson and the guy was
like okay but no this guy had three
focuses which is digital imaging mobile
devices and what was the third one oh
and gaming those are the three focuses
which is funny because they came out
with a lot of 4k TVs and you know it's
not part of their their focus strategy
but you know I just I feel that he
really really nailed it with mobile you
guys I know you guys I don't know if you
got your pastor don't know in this event
really uh in this event they don't even
have any tablets ok this is no but what
I'm saying is this is the first time
that I see a sony xperia device that i
want to have really which one is which
one
the Xperia Z so then the new flagship I
like it I really like the what do
you like that it's very minimalistic Lee
design i feel it's you know one thing
that I love about Sony my house is full
of sony stereo systems and everything
and TVs you know i love you know their
their design good taste they really know
how to make something simplistic look
beautiful and that's where Apple got a
lot of their design kids friendly
exactly an apple wood it would admit
that they got their design cues from
Sony absolute oh yeah and I feel that
it's like if this guy just went back
hired those designers from years ago and
told them build me a good Xperia then
the result would be the Xperia Z which
was very easy I did like the design so
far you know we didn't really get a
chance to use that you I much and that
was part of my disappointment with the
experience when I reviewed it um it was
it wasn't a very beautifully designed
phone but I remember that that the
Xperia S was a phone that would not win
any records it wasn't thinner than
anything it wasn't smaller than
exaggerated pictures it took great
photos um and but by the way i mean the
the same image sensors that are used on
the iphone 5 were built by sony right so
you know i feel that everything has
conglomerated into this experience II I
really want to try it I really do do you
think how do you think it'll do I mean
we all had our hands on with it we all
we all put it on the video I mean like
dude does it have its cuz Sony's big
thrust with this presentation was they
want to wow you yep they said that about
15 times and you know like that's they
said they don't understand and when
other companies don't set out to wow you
and I have to tell you I thought the
Xperia Z was very pretty yes but it
they've removed so many of the things
that made a sony device recognizable
there's not a for example a transparent
band through part of the device with
LEDs embedded which I of course it's a
gimmick but at least is it was
recognizable there is no arc design that
the the casing is as flat a rectangle as
you can get in fact it looks just like
an Optimus G so the more I looked at the
experience either less wowed I was and
then you granted it's beautiful but you
feel like get up close to see the beauty
of the of the tempered glass and it's
like well this doesn't Wow me at all
sony I don't know it did well me I I
think they
overdo it with all the flash all around
the device yeah there's a there's a
cover for every port yeah and it's made
of glass yeah it's overkill really is
they overdid that I mean they should
have just left the bottom the bottom
with a bit colder that's right there's
this needle the fort all the ports there
that's been talking about this yeah your
view your favorite you fell in love with
the co special I I don't like the Z that
much because it has so much class too
much glass and then it feels kind of
kind of fragile like the Optimus G or
the nexus 4 I don't want to deal off the
table yeah and this flaps are just
maddening um I should also say that the
Z's screen and the ZL screen there's
something off about it we were is isn't
there we were looking at it from from
from pretty extreme viewing angles and
they were just like white yeah they wash
out to view there were a little washed
out but in my experience with the Xperia
S that was a screen protector and that
it was out the demo devices did have
screen protectors and I whispers I don't
know why Sony does this they always ship
their phones with an embedded screen
protectors up the the viewing angles
exact yeah but would you go on a ZL so
the ZL has this awesome feature and it's
not really advertised except in the
literature that comes with it that it
has the most amount of screen the ratio
of screen to device facade is the
highest of any other device which which
makes it look just kind of futuristic
kind of bezel this yeah and it's just
when I picked up the ZL like my tail wag
you know you know either now feeling
like actually totally yes you know when
you when you like feel something you're
like damn yes this is like when you pick
up an iphone 5 for the first time you're
like damn yeah when you pick up I felt
that about about the galaxy s3 galaxy s3
it's like this thing is so thin and
light it's crazy I felt that stop
looking good for you guys no no no
please please please sister so I got it
I got that with the ZL the ZL has a
matte finish so you don't have to worry
about the glass thing it's not
waterproof etter which is fine by me
when I go to the bathroom I try to not
bring the phone after i drop the
sensation of the toilet but then i said
we got the key from already got the
toilet sends your toilet phones to Jaime
Rivera
alright my piece you know it's it's not
as as fancy it's a more rugged xperia z
and i just i i really really really well
it was a cool example of this thing we
talked about rather frequently which is
that mid-range phones are getting more
and more impressive in various ways and
in some ways that are out there
outstripping the flagships i have wanted
mid-range phones more than than
flagships several times now i don't
really know if the xperia ZL would be
considered a mid-range ranges next time
it's a high end but just a different
variant and i think that some carriers
are gonna pick the glory old owners know
it considered in a vacuum i would agree
with you but put on a shelf next to the
z it is a mid-range it is the mid-range
alternative cuz it's gonna be fifty
dollars cheaper or is gonna be a hundred
always cheaper none i mean right so I
mean that's what I mean I think that
it's a vernacular thing but like so
here's what Sony needs to do with these
with a Z to make it CS success with the
galaxy s3 if they need to get it on
every carrier yeah and they need to not
give in to carrier branding so it's the
experience he on every carrier and they
need to market it so that everyone knows
that Sony makes an awesome smartphone
and and profit and profit and repeat
right what do you think they're gonna do
that because I don't oh it's very tough
HTC hasn't done it in years the only
Kobe has done this is samsung they've
got so much leverage right but like
those two things are what make the
difference between you know 20 million
units and 1 million units I noticed that
the CEO has a lot of focus yeah his
presentation was I mean wrong Justin
just think about it I mean he started he
started his his his work as a CEO
finally bringing Sony devices back to
the United States mmm with the Xperia
ion and the Xperia which was it that was
on AT&amp;amp;T the tea yeah the experience here
I forget all these things nature it's
it's alphabet soup I know that office
today oh god absolutely I was about to
say that I you know if I were Sony I
would completely I don't know i think
the xperia as a brand I think it's dead
I honestly a 90 degree hey guys back all
the way to the experienced one I was
just gonna say I feel like I was never
born I feel that that should have died
with Sony Ericsson and they should have
brought like the sony one yeah sony to
sony 1x know
like no I agree yeah that would have
been so much cleaner and someone and
brought the Sony name back into the into
the forefront snotty good because what
they're doing is they're using the
Xperia Brown like Samsung uses the
galaxy s3 right too much less yeah and
everybody back oh you've got the new
galaxy right they don't use it on the
the tablets you know yes they don't go
that far what do they did they started
that any fun yeah what is it the Xperia
tab or some BS i don't know i feel that
the xperia branch should die I feel it
should be like the sony one usually like
I agree yeah I agree hey completely
agree cuz Sony for all its kind of
inaction in the American mobile space it
has still been it's still a well
respected brand name if you happen to
buy TVs and home theaters and I would
seriously be proud to say i have a sony
phone yes only 100 yeah sony nine anyway
nice yeah I don't whatever it was it was
a fun event and it was cool to get her
hands on some real premium hardware
after you're not seeing much premium
hardware and that's pretty much would
you say that's the only premium mobile
stuff we honestly I sell that Sony saved
the day for mobile on Monday that's a
yes at CES monday was like oh god I was
like seriously feeling this is gonna be
like the worst trade show ever ever yeah
because on Monday just think about it we
were at the ATM t event which last year
had six devices that's the only reason
why I was like okay let's go and we got
nothing the pantech discover discover
which we didn't even want to discover
don't look for a video about that we're
not gonna waste your time I listeners
right yeah so forget about the pantech
discover it wasn't even at the show and
that's just to point out that not even
the CEO was proud to show it off right
again it's just so that we did huawei
which was a sort of a way it was okay
but it was sort of a waste of time
Samson the Samsung event wasn't really
wasted time because brandon loved the 4k
but we didn't get any any devices until
the next day and it was pretty much the
woman is at the excalibur the odyssey
now i wanna i do want to be honest i do
want to talk about that because we did
the eyes that this is the second time
that discovered
you don't hear the second time we've
reminded brandon with the oddity of the
achieve odyssey the samsung windows
phone so we saw just really briefly
we're just touching this we saw two
mid-range windows phones and windows
phone 8 devices at the at the event and
the first was was the samsung a TV
odyssey which samsung was nice enough to
show us at their booth their large booth
and we got some hands-on video which you
probably saw and I at first I think
everyone thought a couple weeks ago that
this was going to be the ax t VES the
high-end windows phone for verizon why
cuz there's a verizon exclusive for the
United States yeah we got to play with
you t this and then we got to her a few
days ago we got to review it and we do I
guess oh you got to see it yeah right
and it's the galaxy s3 windows for me
right and that's a great thing I mean I
really like that device so we're
everyone was excited with our all the
achieve obviously all that must be
verizon's atty best no it's verizon's
mid-range Windows Phone 8 but it is
Samsung's first windows phone 8 device
in the United States grey and I was
outselling Michael it's like okay let's
film a comparison between this and we
actually had an atty mess with us right
and Michael's like what am I gonna
compare yeah seriously I'm going to film
one bit whether you like it or not what
am I gonna go that's true and seriously
it was right well yeah good point you
know what in the same mid-range
conversation and i'll say i'll talk
about the huawei w one in the same
breath or w/e there's w1 right yeah
another mid-range 4 inch or 800 x 480
you know nothing that's gonna blow
anybody skirt up but they're both
devices that feel good in the hand and
that people who don't want a jumbo phone
noah Kravitz had a really good tweet
today where he was just like Noah from
formerly of phone Doug formerly
TechnoBuffalo formerly I'm talking about
full movie in former citizen I know a
great tweet where he said something to
the effect of oh my god someone
announced a high-end phone that is that
has normal human sized hand dimensions
just gonna say all of these all these
bid Rachel phones are thick yeah like
badass thin mid-range phones I guess
there are a few but the thing is because
their thick and because they're small on
their face they feel great to hold hi my
brought me a palm pre of three today
which I hugged him for a couple days ago
and why do you say that
don't tell the listeners no I won't tell
one talk about our hugs any move but no
and it reminded me of how great it is to
feel something in the hand that's not
trying to be the thinnest thing ever the
biggest thing ever it's like oh wow this
is designed for uh for human hands this
is let me understand bring your point is
that you want a high-end phone that's
smaller that's what you want yeah see I
got a 4.3 there's like no premium 4.3
inch oak it's exactly right listeners do
me a favor and hate me for this because
I know you will but I think Phil
Schiller said it best there is no
greatness and doing a high-end phone
that's bigger anybody can do a bigger
phone and just fit everything in there I
agree the innovation is if you're
actually capable of doing while we did
in a weekend with me oh there I garage
that's how big at six no six point one
no they probably started with five
inches and they were like okay can we
fit the processor no it doesn't fit this
okay let's add two inches well why we
came and came across a box of like old
car in car gps units with huge screens
like how we can use these yeah got an
exacto and they were like okay know that
now it's five point four inches right oh
oh oh my god the the radio it doesn't
fit okay let's go to 5.5 right when they
finished by the end of the day it was a
six-inch room that's what happened and I
feel you know even if people don't care
or don't like the Apple philosophy I
mean there were two devices which is a
complete irony but it's true the 222
devices that I saw on the show floor
that everybody had is the iphone 5 and
the galaxy note 2 and go to camera oh
because well but there's a reason for
that right there's a reason for the
galaxy camera to be human is exceeding
the galaxy camera seller giving them two
members of press yeah I wrote to me but
uh here's my thing right III like
mid-range phones because they're getting
so much better and they really are and I
think it started with the in this in
recent memory it started with the HTC 8s
with a the Lumia 820 and Windows Phone
side and we're seeing I learned or no
mess as well when they pull the 1s it
was a mid-range phone that wasn't that
then feel mid-range when you grab hey I
meant I meant 8's I'm sorry but one SES
no you're right on the Android side so
anyway yeah we
some of that I wish we'd we'd see more I
I still think that so one of these days
I'm gonna buy a mid-range phone that's
gonna be my daily driver for a while
because I'm tired of it i like the
utility of the note tues larger screen
yes but i also like a pocketable device
what good as you say I the thought last
year and at the end of last year that I
wanted to get I get the galaxy s2 again
cuz my other one's broken I threw it
across the room oh and i would get
galaxy s2 again and uses my daily driver
because that was like one of the best
phones I've ever had it was smaller
screens wvga which just burns my eyes
but but besides that it's a mid-range
phone now that you know so thin and
light and just fast and well done mm-hmm
oh great I think it's a good phone I
don't know I think you know the problem
is this Michael you've already reviewed
all of Nokia's mid-range lineup and
you're not carrying any of the entire
thing yeah yeah why is that in mind
we'll talk about nokia which was pretty
much inexistent i was just gonna say
that'll take 20 seconds yeah yeah no I
the reason I don't carry and Lumia 800
series devices because they none of the
designs I didn't find any design designs
attractive physically I didn't like the
hardware if they were in an 8 s body the
HTC 8s i would probably would okay yeah
yeah so that is that was so good about
wasn't a speck thing so what about nokia
are they had a gorgeous press room that
they offered us which was very nice of
that I know we wish we've been able very
nice thank you know kid but we would
have wished that there were devices in
no press room yeah but you know what I I
think they're saving i think that the
common wisdom for all this stuff is that
they're saving a lot of this for for mwc
in their own but here's the deal i mean
they were pretty much inexistent than in
WC last year right and maybe and that's
the complete irony and we're in a weird
trough right because they just released
a whole bunch of high-end stuff you're
putting the paperwork together for
Microsoft's de violette nominee that's
right oh now that your peers a theory
I've seen so many times you know it's
gonna happen no skills not gonna sell
enough Lumias to stay relevant it's
viable yeah Microsoft can have to save
them and that's it and they have my own
contract it probably some sort of rite
of you know first refusal or something
ya know there's a yeah he's like a
triggering Claus right yeah yeah and
speaking of Microsoft I mean Microsoft
microsoft had pretty much ended the CES
keynote every single year for almost the
past decade and it was funny that last
year when i was at what I was at the
keynote um you know the the you know the
see a guy was I forget his name but he
was telling Steve Ballmer you know it's
been a great decade but there's gonna be
the last time you were ever going to do
this he was actually that blunt really
this up thank you very much has been a
great time and you know next year we're
gonna give somebody else the opportunity
we actually skipped the keynote but it's
just to give you the idea that Microsoft
was another company that was completely
in existence oh and yet they were there
uh vicariously through many many other
companies yeah you are yes very reliant
on windows 8 success oh yeah what God we
saw a ton of as usual if he says we
expected we saw a ton of Windows 8
tablets a lot of which we'd seen before
oh you remember that 20 inch 4k not
waking up panasonic on another man that
thing was slower than me sir the open
webOS alpha i thought it i mean is there
really a graphics processor that's
capable of driving that many of you
would there is they would just have one
minute of battery life well he said it
was one hour battery it has two hours
which is better than I feel funny and
yeah but you know seriously I would be
I'll be nice to Panasonic because they
were bold enough to build it yeah tell
them what that tough yeah tell me so hi
man Brandon went to go look at this
thing it's a 20 inch tablet I don't
understand why with 4k resolution which
is 4k resolution which is what that
awesome today is what's that what's the
resolution 1080 turns flow right we did
that begin to this last night yeah we
heard 2145 or 21 6539 no no it's a lot
more 2140 is like the ipad no but it's
double what the what 1080p is no it's
four times with two atps yeah that's
right that's four times with 10 is it
really yeah it's four times for 1080p
yes can you tell I don't pay attention
to resolution yeah so you guys went idea
should i don't know you know you're the
guy on the team but the resolution is
the most important part of life support
it's worth it it's for 320 piece so of
course you guys went to go look at this
thing and I don't understand why guys
why does this exist cuz I was over
checking out other stuff well they why
did this 20 inch they were really
planning to sell the town it's like when
the mic the original surface project
came from Microsoft pretty pensive it's
a proof of concept but there they were
doing this building a store demo okay
that would use the extra resolution and
everything looked gorgeous on the talent
you know they were like yeah it'll
probably sell by the end of 2013 I don't
care if they don't sell it I love the
fact that 4k is already existent and so
fast and I love your fact I love the
fact that windows was natively capable
of dealing with 4k it should be capable
of scaling infinitely right yeah as long
as the graphics processor is capable of
dealing with it windows will didn't
scale it the right way like all the
tiles were very small when he went back
there up to level okay but they weren't
four times smaller and that's the thing
I mean I feel that that there is a
feature for 4k who knows we've probably
sorted for the 4k tablets next year on a
refrigerator microwave oven with the
highest resolution display ever said
that's where it's at 8k oh come on i
think panasonic headed hktv which is
comes after 4k yeah and it's real and
it's a you know it you know I can talk
all day about TBS I think huh still
nobody none of us is gonna buy one CES
2013 is not a show to come to if you
don't want to hear about tvs by one in
five years when they're the same price
on mon right right now it's more
expensive than a mortgage I mean come on
yeah gonna buy vizio is doing three
sizes of 4k TVs between 2030 500 bucks
which is a lot but not 10,000 ok let's
talk about vizio that's good epica doing
yeah yeah I mean they launched a couple
of devices out the reason we haven't
seen him yet and the reason why there's
no video for that is because there
wasn't any booth well there well it was
we're gonna make me in the end of the
nation then what yeah it should be
leaving Las Vegas by the way listeners
if you are have never been to Las Vegas
Las Vegas is the walking capital of the
world if you are at a restaurant and
you're having dinner and you need to go
to the bathroom you had better plan on a
15 minute excursion commute commute
every single destination is as far away
as possible and the hallways are scaled
to accommodate elephants I feel
tes is a citywide like what convention
have you ever heard of citywide it's
incredible I ever it's not an all-in-one
convention center which is the size of a
city block anyway it's like you mention
Center let's let's go check out what
asus has we have to drive about 30
minutes or yeah well you know wait in
the cab line for 45 minutes or take a
shuttle that stops at many other places
and then finally at the position it's
just exactly then we ever find the shoes
by the way better in their elimination
no I don't they'd already know that's
another case last year at well at least
this time this year's better last year
they had a debt booth a debt very small
booth with dummy units and no
representative really a sous last year
that's that's what it was on the yeah I
mean as Jews is like the best
manufacturer of Android tablets yeah
currently and for the for them to not
have anything at sea as it's like what
but you know what i think it's an
indication of how less how much less
seriously manufacturers are taking CES
that's the point and i think that's been
that like the theme of the year and most
of the commentary is like I've seen
several people say the CES isn't really
even gonna be even as impressive as this
in a couple years like it's no it's it's
a platform okay you platform for smaller
companies to be able to get a foothold
that's what else going to say yeah yeah
I but concern hmm i have a concerned
that android tablets the momentum for
them is going to slow down significantly
because if you look at what we have we
have like a device like the nexus 10 and
people don't really talk that much about
the nexus 10 but I hasn't sold that much
it's an amazing piece of hardware
extremely high-resolution display
running the latest version of Android
and we've got some smaller tap to the
Nexus 7 and just probably the best
android tablet out there but like at CES
no one did anything with nothing with
Android tablets I feel like the only
shining star the only ray of hope is the
next Nexus 7 oh I don't know man we went
to the polaroid booth oh but no you're
absolutely right though but it's it's
just strange because you know there's so
much enthusiasm for iOS tablets yeah and
i think the app story really helps drive
that and like Tia apps apps apps and and
what can google do and we talked
wats podcast object what can google do
to fix the tablet problem on Android and
there's really no answer I think it is
doing it I think is doing it slowly and
it's the same thing as it's during a
mobile with Google now and Google
integration and the Google ecosystem
plug enough it's enough to make me focus
more on straight Google products and an
iOS ones in the tablet space I think I
will agree with Google now but I have I
have learned how to appreciate google
now in this trip more than ever yeah how
I'm airport and he takes out as Google
now which was stacked to the fullest
extent it showed his flight arrival it
should exchange which showed exchange
rates to the score to the game that he
was watching yeah the distance to home
this all matter you without without am I
asking the device is like 15 cards of
completely relevant information and I've
delivered automatically and I've seen
that on my phone but um you know I think
about the iphone just going to the Patil
United I'm looking for my when what is
my next flight and look at just going
after wrap of doing what Google now did
ya in less than a second is amazing it'd
be awesome to have that as a watch with
it I've got ours is it phone is approach
knows this concept but imagine google
now streaming to your arrest rock hey
you know with pebble that might be with
when they open that up that might be a
possibility the developer could easily
can i use a google round stuff on your
watch probably and pebble just had an
announcement this morning were they were
they finally after months and months and
months said their device is gonna be
available in january twenty third he's
gonna start shipping people be hey
screaming for their money back but you
know it's good i was we're going to
attend we ended up having a PR
obligation that ran late last night
that's not you know that it was actually
really really cool and a lot of fun but
unfortunately couldn't make it to the
pebble thing today so but we caught up
on the news and it looks like those are
shipping and I'm really really really
jazzed because we're gonna cover that a
lot and it would be great if the
developers could write google now int'l
to that so we still point you don't want
to use an iphone so what would you want
a pebble for well I think it's eat pears
to Android devices is really yeah no no
it doesn't he doesn't want a concept
that only work with the iphone oh yeah
they've almost immediately broadened it
to android
when they started getting like crazy
money Oh calm cuz there's going to be
such limited its things you can do with
the iOS agreed yeah injury it's gonna be
it's gonna be extensible really if this
then that support I I have seriously
learned to value Android and everything
that jelly bean has done with Google now
with everything on this trip seriously
mmm I would you know I it's funny cuz
i'm currently using and yes by the way i
am using a Windows Phone listeners yeah
and why CC 8x you've been using it the
whole trip I'm seeing them everywhere by
the way windows up hey do they to 8x
like right I've seen like 10 of them
yeah yeah I've seen I've seen a couple
of a texts and so yes listeners I am
using a windows phone 8x and I will do
it after the buzz to tell you what I
think about it later but it yeah but it
was just funny cuz um that we were
thinking about navigation and then
Brandon was like why don't you use the
iphone and I'm like what am I gonna use
the iphone the perfect I've caught the
galaxy s3 here so I I have learned to
rely more on Android on this trip than
ever before and it's been cool like it
seriously every 5 or 10-minute time I
will be like whoa like what's going on
here like you think I see him and I turn
around he's looking down at his note 2
which is saying something agreed I mean
I I look at Michael using his note 2 and
I'm like how can i get for the first two
days I was completely on denial mode I
was like I'm okay I'll give it a try
when I get back to him by this I'll give
it a try there and then you know I keep
looking at Michael doing these crazy
things with that phone and I'm like okay
fine all right i'll sacrifice um spacca
some pocket space bring it over let me
use it let me let me just mention that
briefly because i think this is
something that I never really considered
before I started coming to these trade
shows and reporting on them what device
is best to cover a show like this and i
found out that for me for my usage
galaxy note 2 the galaxy note 2 but but
more importantly the galaxy note 2
versus my other daily driver my primary
daily driver the Lumia 920 which I still
adore but which is not useful for
covering CES for me because of my tight
integration with did with the Google
ecosystem and also because of the
extensibility of the galaxy note 2 and
the customizability of it and i've got
flight board checking our flights on one
home screen
your your your your leisure phone it's
pretty much exactly the 920 is what I do
when I when I wanna when I can take a
step back and life slows down a little
bit and I can enjoy my experience i'll
try to get work done that note 2 is that
is where it's at and the third device
would be I think that I be I was
completely mad at the galaxy camera I
still consider it to be like the
stupidest concept on the planet but yes
listeners the only time you would ever
need a galaxy cameras for a trip mm-hmm
you know if you're gonna cover an event
and Sampson was smart about it they
pretty much gave everybody a galaxy
camera to come over CES and it was okay
and they're they're everywhere as a
result and we've used them with the
dropbox integrate its it's super handy
we beam pictures of the guys at home and
running the posts yeah we took the
pictures and they were linked to the
common dropbox yeah within seconds i had
to pick and the video you know yeah yeah
cuz Andrew let you do that that was
great i was great and you know to be
honest with you I I still feel that the
galaxy camera would be I would pay four
hundred and fifty dollars i would pay
six hundred dollars if they gave me a
mirrorless version of the galaxy camera
you know a camera that take that took
great photographs and and would also
have the the data capabilities but that
said we were at the AT&amp;amp;T at the TT
developer summit and brandon was taking
these awesome photos of the keynote
because of all the 20 what's this the 21
exhume that that camera has yeah that I
did not have on my DSLR by the way which
is pretty cool which was pretty cool and
the photos were okay I just I feel that
the camera is great if it were cheaper
and if you know I don't know can we talk
about I'm sorry you just reminded me of
that spell for the fire do you remember
the one cool thing about that more the
really cool thing about the morning they
had and they're learning there was one
there was a lottery toes now the
breakfast oh the breakfast burritos were
excellent yes no no but not not those
like Doritos uh-huh that's where that's
really a car that's rated our no but no
no but they had a really cool thing at
this thing where they had winners of an
app development comes is like a
hackathon like a 26-hour thing right and
then three contestants come up and they
were all cool submissions but this guy
came up with somebody
came up so we had yeah bunny ears that
are this retail available thing where
you wear them on your head and they read
your brainwaves you can wait like this
is reading my brain waves right you can
wiggle your bunny ears with your brain
and I guess that's pretty cool putting
in 26 hours or something the guy
modified it and connected it with his
phone so that when he received an
incoming call which he did he
demonstrated on stage he said he had
somebody call him his phone started
ringing and he rejected the call by
thinking you have if you if you're
having a high-level brain activity
rejects the call and you get like a
canned message that says says please try
again later yeah yeah but it means like
this it's so such a good idea that's
amazing what deploy my face off yeah
well and as I mean he was wearing the
bunny ear headset with one money or
Romania to take one apart for like parts
or something like that her but anyway
that was cool and that was one of the
few like windows into the into the real
future that I saw not really I maybe the
less real future I don't know that the
wild spectacular sci-fi future that I
think shows like CES should provide but
another one was that we're not Brennan
and I went to go visit the chi booth the
wireless power consortium hi may perhaps
sensing this was coming has taken out
his newspaper and put on his sunglasses
I'm who is not used or ever had any
interest in wireless charging but
Brandon and I checked that out in the
video will be up maybe never I may if
maybe I have to add at this one I don't
know sure that should i why don't you
let me do it cuz you'll fall asleep go
in it okay um we had a wonderful booth
tour from a representative of the Qi
wireless power consortium and he showed
us all this all these incredible
wireless charging pad some of which were
integrated into automobiles yeah that
makes a lot of sense because that make
sense that makes it are the first thing
I do is I take my phone out of my pocket
so that I can check my text message and
that is a nice and that isn't ways where
I don't want wires I mean if you gave me
an inductive charging pad that also
pulled the music from my phone and
pushed it to the car that would be the
perfect usage yeah well they've already
got it with NFC built-in you tap
enhances you have it do knobbly but
again I know what you need is car
manufacturers that'll do it and they're
doing that the one of the Chi guys she
told the toyota avalon the new toyota
avalon will have it built in i think
costing was yeah the coil that moved
based on where us so like you know like
one of the big issues of the wireless
charging that's been so annoying is that
you have to put the phone in a very
specific little target and Texas
Instruments has developed a chipset that
allows that that target area to be wider
so on the Nokia Lumia charging pay you
drop it on the search bread wherever and
it'll charge that's fine but this one
was an even bigger one that he showed us
it was about the size of what like a
like a book right okay yeah maybe 10
inches by 7 inches and you drop your
phone anywhere on the pad and it kind of
waits for a minute and then all of a
sudden this blue ring of lights appears
on the pad and tracks its way over to
underneath your phone hot sauce in
minutes start saying it's not something
that is so alien I have this thought so
so let's say it's two years from now
three years from now we've wireless
charging pads everywhere they're like on
the nightstand of the hotel there in our
cars yeah and we're just constantly
charging our device and then it kind of
misses the point kind of gifts OEM as an
excuse to not innovate on battery life
because we're constantly topping off you
ever think about that I think like a
wireless charger right now today even
encourage you is it encouraging you to
charge a lot more often absolutely true
but I think that that makes for us if
the entire world had our usage habits
and had our consistent love affair with
being inside you know I mean like that
would be that would be the case but I
think there are so many people who spend
so long away from rooms and out in the
world you know and terrified maybe you
go outside but you say we had that
moment a couple times yesterday we were
trying transitioning between exhibit
halls and we look outside like oh
there's others windows here there's no
tomorrow the Sun has changed the sky
yeah now told us there what's going on
um but it's that was those pretty cool
this was cool to get that treasure I
still have the feeling that wireless
charging like in a vehicle it makes
sense for me I hate wires in my car
right absolutely that is like the place
where I would love their the my Honda
has this little compartment in the
middle that used to be four CDs you
don't exist anymore or at least for me
they don't and that's where I usually
place my phones mmhmm yeah me so if I
had a wireless charging pad that I could
place their bunk and just leave it leave
my post that would be like perfect i was
little can't you do that anyway if you
take like a plug it into your cigarette
allen
can you do that when o it like a
wireless charging pad and plugin you can
but then you got to secure the pad
somewhere yes double stage because it
wouldn't be moving around and
everything's yeah that's why the
magnetic attachment of the nexus 4 to
it's charging dock makes a lot of sense
and I wish that was a part of the cheese
standard as well I do I just feel I'm
not really concerned with like what
you're concerned Brandon I feel that you
know battery technology is still
something it is still you know even i
think it was Steve Jobs that one
sentence it's funny how that's the
technology that has least that grown I
mean if you want more battery power
which you need as a bigger battery that
you there's no way you can make a
smaller battery yet right and that's
really where people need to push and
probably the ipad mini's like the first
example where there has been true
innovation on the battery hands on the
design of the battery for is it to make
it thinner and i feel that the problem
with wireless charging is still again I
feel that it's still a gimmick until you
get it for free on the box we were
talking about this last night if you
have to buy it nobody comes in the box
than your game yeah if it comes in the
box all yeah why not I'll use it why not
I mean yeah I mean I don't I don't
really mind if I have to choose between
acquired charging or wireless charging
as long as it's included in the box
that's me and she wouldn't made a big
deal about saying like we have a big
focus on not relying on interchangeable
backs and stuff like that we want to
build it into as many devices as
possible but also and this is crucial to
what you're saying I think in order for
it to catch on in a wide sense
manufacturers have to start including at
least one wireless charging plate in the
box I'll give you an example in people
from most probably listeners you won't
remember this ten years ago or I'd say
12 years ago if you wanted vibration on
your Nokia phone you needed to buy a
special bad bad a special a turret right
had the vibration now that's true the
vibration thing and then if you wanted
for example a speakerphone non you're on
your cell phone you needed to buy a
special motorola that included it and
then it started becoming ubiquitous in
2005 yeah when everything started
getting a speakerphone which was yeah
but it was it was the first motorola v60
cast that included the
this is a speakerphone speaker with me
six TV or something that yes it's the X
and so I again if manufacturers are not
really willing to include it somehow it
won't and they will and it is already
taking off I mean you know it's not just
nokia that's doing i mean we've got HTC
doing it in the butterfly / droid DNA
we've HTC doing it for their a tax like
Verizon in the States seems to be making
a big push toward toward this for some
reason I don't know what the carrier's
interest is and having everybody would
enable for wireless charging but what
then it has a bemused look on his face
as he reclines in a recumbent pose in
the chair overlooking the Las Vegas
Strip let's tune into his thoughts well
I was going to talk about noida valley
hahahahaha so you remember the name
thing you know yeah we're walking around
in what we refer to as the slums of
types of CES what is on the sides
there's all these like no name booths of
companies make me the stupidest crap you
could ever possibly they actually have
their banners printed out of paper yeah
Judy drop by hand like that yeah it's
iphone cases and they're made out of
like grass and Lisa we stumble across
this interesting booth called noite
diwani and they've got these devices set
up they've got a tablet a big tablet a
small tablet attendance of an inch and a
phone with this crazy awesome amazing
design and they're all dummy units kind
of like prototype right then next to it
there are a bunch of rugged phones yeah
which are not Donald switcher which I
fell in love with ya what phone is this
he's like oh they don't have a name yet
it was the weirdest thing that's right
and so it's this company who's who's
trying to like make Android devices and
with with very interesting designs
beautiful designs and it's Michael and I
were kind of joking on on whether it's
just another case of a company that
vaporware either way it really screams
that's that's the saddest thing about
the whole thing to me because those
designs are beautiful and by the way
that whole team was was really amped to
when we can really nice they were really
nice that is not a cologne use so he had
such a nice suit on like a sketch pad
out like designing the next yeah we
describe the
design language a network the design the
thrust of the whole experience cuz they
were different did the rugged phones
were likes on em devices like really
breaking things and they're like bc
weapons you they basically worry yeah
and then the but these are the ones that
caught Brandon's i were were beautifully
symmetrical on the edges they were with
rounded edges they leave a video yes
yeah yeah it's not up yet yeah it'll be
up soon but anyway so and but they also
had like a race car out there and they
had like did this weird concept phone
that like has a fold-out thing and it
looks like a tube of lipstick on
steroids but it has like a pop-up
display when physical keyboard and i
don't know that that one to me screamed
really really far out in the future and
not even nearly go we've got a prototype
on its right we got a prototype but it's
not here yet it's like anxious yeah yeah
yeah yeah i don't think they're so some
of it was that was the frustrating part
cuz some of it was so like gosh i wish
this was even close to production but
it's probably not but then you know we
couldn't entirely dismiss them because
it wasn't just cardboard dummy phones
they had working models of those big
rugged ones and then but we fired up one
day there was another working device we
fired up that looked a lot like a note 2
and it was running like a some rip off
version of TouchWiz 36 inch screen wvga
resolution and it had touch with the
weirdest thing that seems illegal to me
yeah I'm so it was orange it was or
initially yeah a lot of it was orange
all right a lot was orange just like the
perfect segue to you what is it ubuntu
ubuntu mobile ubuntu you blinked what a
great time we had it ubuntu you like you
but yeah i can't say i was i was really
amped i was I it's too bad that I wasn't
at the booth I really have high hopes
for you bug too here's what I care about
it and not to the not too distant future
the image is going to be released so
that everyone in their mother the few
hours are you gonna an hour Alaskan can
put it on their phone and it have a
entirely new operating system i can't
wait i'm gonna do that on the Galaxy
Nexus that you so kindly provided and
I'll take away from you has it man no
nobody was great to see in person we
didn't necessarily expect them to have a
demo unit in the booth but then there
was and there were nice enough to give
us a
tour there and very good to her oh yeah
using it is it's like a puzzle there are
just so many gestures and screens and
things to figure out I like Windows 8
except when somehow well web or us now
Weber us from simpler than both windows
8 and and what were you buddy that's a
whole nother copper funny the funniest
thing in the nice guy who worked for
Yvonne two and had the Galaxy Nexus we
were trying to frame the video and so he
said Michael sodomie you know I know
you've been demoing everything you don't
have to do that for us we just want to
see the top three things and he said
I'll give you the top four things in
fact the four things are the four edges
of the screen that you can use that was
great it was like such a Polish to the
no usage in paradigm is that you use the
edges of the screen so it's a buttonless
design and and I think we talked about
it last podcast how you can quickly
switch between apps and I express
concern and you could not go backwards
but what it does is if you swipe from
right to left it goes to your next at
and then it's basically cycles it
rotates between 3x yeah like the last
three in memory which which makes
perfect sense I think a rotates between
all the all the apps that are that are
currently open right and it just cycles
endlessly until it starts over again the
beginning so so you could I guess
conceivably only open two apps so if you
just email web um yeah you can hop
easily between them yeah right yeah man
make a prediction no come now yes I go
with Michael yes of course come on I'll
invites a beer okay listeners hate me
for this but it's gonna be true either
Microsoft figures out how to make
Windows Phone 8 something important or
you bunt to be being laid on the same
core linux core that android does is
gonna probably be the third operators no
no not ever in a year or two years in
are you most gonna be a hot are you high
it's gonna be a hobbyist operating syste
stink about it it's open source anybody
could pull you bun to but you can't run
android apps on that's the well how much
do you think it'll take for that virtual
Android the Android virtual machine to
work on you bun too well we saw this way
this is this is a really good segue he's
explained yes thing we were still in the
in this this of the supplies we were
still in the CES slums which by the way
which by the way I put out on Twitter I
was like kissing kissing there like
clever name for this and like people
responded with a couple of a bunch of
names and somebody finally said the
cesspool would see yes Kevin but listen
there's a lot of cool stuff and I don't
want to talk about the fringes in a poor
light but because we stumbled across
this outfit that I'd heard of before
called the the Open Mobile rope it's the
opener Mobile Alliance right so yeah and
I heard about them in the context of
webos because when we talk about things
like mobile you bun to open webOS
sailfish whatever we talk about these
new platforms which are maybe beautiful
in a UI perspective and they may work
really well but they are they have a
major handicap and that they have no
apps that's the that's the number ones
that's exactly and you might not eat is
what you might as well not even try and
blackberry realize this when they
develop that whatever that virtual
android app runner for the PlayBook was
which it would SH I don't know in other
words never worked ranges problems with
it right he saw the buy it through the
right anyway and the open mobile uh
folks were very kindly were they were
under NDA on a lot of stuff they
couldn't show us a lot of stuff which is
maybe why they were on the fringes to
see yes and I feel like they maybe had a
similar show last year so that's a lot
of people were saying on Twitter like
they're basically it's shown the same
exact thing that should last children
has when it posts I'm sorry the deal is
that with the they were basically
running apps coded for android on non
Android devices for us so they had a
Tizen developer device i was running
Tizen but they were running the Android
version of angry birds and it's not an
an emulator it's not on a scan it on the
window yes it's not sandbox yeah you've
no ideas and they they had a touchpad
there that they said could run android
apps yep which we just blew my mind
absolutely and actually we right yeah
yeah we should we shouldn't talk anymore
about that but we saw some really ok so
what direction I'm is in with me Bo
Tizen Ali's based on the Linux core
that's a very good question I don't know
it all of them are I believe they are
okay oh it's like you said submission of
all time right yeah hey please listeners
chiming in the car I think I'm based on
linux actually oh yeah yeah didn't you
look a little Russian yes so did the
point is that I mean you know who knows
this idea obviously has a lot of
potential obviously there's a lot of
licensing issues probably why we haven't
seen low
big progress on it but if something like
this could gain mainstream acceptance if
you could get suddenly 250,000 apps free
or plat for your brand new platform then
i would say that maybe mobile mobile
your bun terry has a bunch of chance to
change the world what you bunt to needs
is number one I two strategies either a
carrier based strategy where they would
figure out you know an oem that would be
willing to push them like HTC for
example mmm that's the first thing or
the second thing would be if they would
allow me to dual-boot you bunt to on any
Android phone out there then that would
grow their popularity at the beginning
allowing for I don't know if you could
switch it will the blue boots annoying
cousin you have to like shut down yeah I
think it died if you quickly switch
between operators if you're like you dis
you bunch of sites I'm gonna get back to
like parallels or something or a boot
camp rotor yeah that doesn't exist for
mobile I mean no I know so many you
didn't do it on the hd2 yeah you can do
anything with the hd2 runs OS just gonna
say you can run a nuclear power fine i
think the hd2 doesn't really i was
seriously you know about some of these
things I don't um yeah I don't know so
anyway anyway so yeah I was surprised by
how smaller booth was I think you open
up my wallet generally present an
impressive ara that they were you know
and they were close to like success and
speed of the you know the smaller boots
no HTC yeah there's an HTC thing tonight
006 we'll see yeah I'm sure they'll just
have devices on display it's a social
thing I don't think they're announcing
they would have done it by now they
would have got a moon yeah unless
they're doing this crazy like reverse
you know psychic move that would be a
cool tactics everyone's always trying to
beat each other before the show starts
he a great acting right like wait till
the end of the show so go your way you
weren't impressed by see yes I'm very
sorry here's 8 devices glam or here's
the old man that is like the smartest
would that be sweet that would be sweet
I Woodrow you should make an
announcement
yeah okay pocketnow now doing a
six-point oh yeah may I feel oh that
would be a really interesting strategy
wouldn't it everybody remembers the last
thing of everything yeah everybody does
things that stays on your mind um there
was actually there was something
interesting there was a flip strategy
tactics were turned on their heads at
the tmobile enhancement yesterday which
we know which we followed from a phone
talked about a little bit you just make
we could make it to the team all of it
but everybody was oh yeah I wish we had
now to Kai I'm like listen gizmodo um
let me be honest with you guys I love
your tweets I love your post you guys
are hilarious they were completely just
bashing the CEO they know know that
we're bashing though they were there
were there were rejoicing in his
freeness oh yeah it was hit the decision
you something poor egg no he didn't know
we've already gotten to that point where
we're twisting everything no but
apparently some decision was made high
in the ranks of t-mobile to do like all
right this new CEO is gonna give this in
Mays amazingly entertaining speech it'll
suit a good job so t-mobile did the
t-mobile see I was talking about like
yeah like Verizon now yeah we respect
them coverage wise I mean they they have
a lot of covers they do a great job
covering the dust bowl with LTE he's
talking to like shared data plans don't
work cuz you know Johnny's gonna be
watching his porn and it's like what are
you talking what's going on to the
tmobile event he was right and he said
something no you know it's true it was a
great job at just what it did was you
already said it made me wish that we
were at the tmobile event ain't on some
pretty cool point differentiators
they're doing their their prepaid
unlimited data plan all right if I run
which is awesome they are doing they're
doing LTE they're getting that out fast
Las Vegas gonna be the first market in a
few weeks and they're gonna have a
hundred million people covered with
everything I've no idea all right middle
the year by entity or 200 many people
which sounds like by the end of this
year well they're gonna cover China as
well they're getting the super range
towers yeah by the end of this year most
people should have t-mobile LTE uh those
other one
crave and the other was his HD voice
thing how all these carriers that talk
about the download there's some phones
out there and no one's thinking
seriously yeah but it'sit's something
something it I think that will continue
to be the case because the device has
device has to support it too but but
it's nice that you have a network that
says hey we're gonna support HD Voice
across our entire network so when you
bring your HD Voice devices to our
network they'll work do you think it'd
make more phone calls when HD voices out
oh I hate funk repellent HD text
messages no I'll tell an ACO when you
get those special seraphs yeah so i can
text in Georgia in Georgia font I'll
tell you this special a commenter once
asked how do we communicate you hospice
of the team yeah the team and it's
interesting because most of our you know
are talking about week leagues have been
recorded through skype yes you know you
skype and and it's amazing how how high
definition sounds like it's right yes
and you don't really you guys sound on
it's not clear than you do right now
exactly because we're breathing our own
air around sky and not just las vegas
desert but the thing is you know I
didn't really have high hopes for HD
Voice until skype adopted HD mmm and
when I started listening to the
difference of a phone call through skype
yeah over data compared to a phone call
over whatever service you want but not
seriously yeah bless you there's no me
there's no mute button in a life but
whenever whatever HD HD voice makes it
it's something I really am looking
forward to yeah I really am it's cool
and and I think it's cool and a broad
sense just rig I don't pay much
attention t-mobile I'll be honest with
you it's doesn't do well in Boston I
don't like their heads either I don't
like no I do like their ads I don't like
that i like the table I like the
t-mobile girl I don't on a motorcycle
she looks I like the pink color I like
to hate the sugar shows like they're so
catchy like we're electrical 12 know how
this job at die that is the worst
commercial to ever hit the airwaves play
dumb and I'm not doing that let's get
out of here well they leave my room oh I
the the thing is I like that there's a
carrier that was on the cusp of a
multi-billion dollar merger and this
they said this is the deutsche telekom
was like finally we can offload t-mobile
USA which we don't care about on 18 G's
shoulders and we'll get rid of this
and tmobile was planning for that and
then it got shut down and rather than
like roll over and die or like you know
do something else there they're like all
right well then we're going to take this
whatever this 10 billion dollar
termination tree was or whatever and
we're gonna have the spectrum that we
won from this failed bid and we're going
to actually do something impressive I
mean I think that's pretty cool I think
they're gonna for the record listeners I
think the only carrier that was actually
like working here was t-mobile and it's
because nobody was using I'm not sure
was it working cuz I don't even think
this you know t-mobile is using it so
can we talk about that for a second
every year I've been in Vegas I've been
I brought an AT&amp;amp;T phone because I'm
usually on Haiti and I always am very
upset that I don't bring a verizon phone
and I insisted on you get some verizon
phones it's gonna be crazy and it was
what so so so previous years it was so
bad that you literally could not make a
phone call for the duration of CES you
could not get a data connection text
messages nothing your phone is worthless
it was like were you were dead yeah and
this year I was so curious because most
I feel like most people here have high
and swept insane LTE now to you supposed
to be much more efficient than the UMTS
and the results are in and it's not
fixed but it's much better and what I
found happening a lot and I think and I
ask people around me everyone was
dropping down to 4G dropping down to
HSPA yes everyone's driving on HSPA and
and deleting the latency was pretty
terrible but you could get through and
there was only one or two times where I
couldn't make a call or I couldn't you
know check my email it's right so yeah
AT&amp;amp;T fixed yes yes I excess when they
throttled us every time we had at all
it's not every good are usually we were
trying to upload like ginger bites a
jitterbug I mean all bunch of ginger
bites it should we got your eyes for you
since you're trying to put ginger snaps
yeah as always and it gets like halfway
through the video and then it's like 450
five minutes remaining yeah which is a
giant Alex got it oh it's gonna be
coming in about two to two weeks ago
yeah when you get back ours are we're
live on the ground at CES will be up by
februari one
um let me get back to a Buddhist I think
it's really cool cuz like LTE it was a
slap in the face for me I had the
opposite level of surprise and like I
was less impressed because yeah because
I it was like LTE is supposed to like
solve all these problems or whatever and
it does and I agree it's way better and
I guess I wasn't here for the all HSPA
days of yore however um it doesn't
matter what network technology you're
using I think if you bring 150,000
people into your city and they're all
using you know half of them or more know
three-quarters of our more using your
network at the same time to transmit
vast quantities of data I just shouldn't
it's there's no way to do it is it but
then it's like I mean they prepared
we've seen cell on wheels we've seen
what sells on like Travis they had they
had wireless hotspot all over they
little distributed antenna system inside
all over the floor there was AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi
which was actually worse than LT they
prepared as as much as they could and
still you cannot prepare enough for that
level of for that Alex I mean I
understand that but it's so frustrating
when you're trying to upload a video
we're trying to get your content out
there you're using like say the press
room for the purpose of the press room
which is to get videos and articles and
photos posted she worked well the ether
house fast yeah but the ethernet Wi-Fi
was atrocious it's it's funny at CES and
I don't think people can appreciate this
so what happened is that Michael and I
for the most part we're on the strip on
the floor filming videos and I mean was
rendering them and processing them and
editing them in the press room but
before that we we had a lot of different
plans on how we were going to upload the
video so we add tethering on LTE on AT&amp;amp;T
on verizon on tmobile we didn't have
sprint because it doesn't have LTE here
just barely yeah it's a way those three
options none of which worked because
they throttle we had Wi-Fi everywhere
which doesn't work and then so you're
like how the hell do we upload these
videos so you go back to the hotel but
the hotel Wi-Fi is terrible you the only
option is to go to the press room which
is actually pretty good option if you
can find a seat and you log into the
ethernet and you're going anything I'd
get out and after yeah yeah so it is
like it's so easy so many obstacles it's
so many obstacles to get videos to out
hotel now out there sir but but but we
got moved into a really good rhythm good
grief yeah
yesterday was the same but it was great
we still got a backlog of what we've got
but six more videos are actually shot we
still have the cesspool of videos ready
we've got ample ample ample blooper
coverage oh yeah oh god we've got some
of this the ciaz mattress was there and
so we tested out early as much as the
latest sir we test out that what is it
the hot dog hundred a meatball leave all
the house blow was that the wireless
mattress yeah yeah yeah and and and also
we have a kind of behind the scenes
video which which we consciously did
showing sort of us yeah that'll take a
little time to edit the way that that
you listeners deserve and it'll be up
soon I live but we really want to show
you what it's like to be here because
it's it's it's I think it's it would be
awesome if you know if you guys could be
with us here I mean it's it's a
beautiful experience of the nces it's an
insane experience but we really want to
share it is really want to share all the
craziness that we had to go to go
through to get the content of and once
we figured it out it was great but every
year it's different in every event is
completely different and and this this
event I feel it was more organized than
last year than definitely um but still I
have my high concerns about the future
of CES after what we saw this year I
don't it's just such an irony all that
all the press events were focused on
mobile and yet the company didn't really
announce anything that was worth talking
about in mobile yeah and that's that's
that's sad i mean for businesses as i've
said to my first CES and i started
following CES 10 years ago yeah and I
like when I was like phonescoop was the
only website I knew about now that I
would follow those guys and they give
the announcements right from CES device
after device Android devices like it was
perfect and I've wanted to go to see us
for such a long time have had a ball
with you guys and it's been a real
wonderful time wandering the tradeshow
floor but it is it sad that that kind of
storm of hundreds of devices from many
manufacturers is no longer the case
every manufacturer wants to do its own
thing and I think I think 2012 was the
best example of that you remember the
day there was a motorola and an nokia in
the nokia and the ipad mini event yeah
yeah oh yeah I don't even have
a week with his nokia motorola and a
motorola and this HTC may be on the same
day in New York ok and then Microsoft
two days later wanted to release windows
phone 8 right and then it was just I
think I think that's what I think that's
the message CES is sadly deluded it
deludes the importance of the company
and I feel that companies are doing it
right everybody that takes what high
importance in what they want to show to
you will do their own event right I mean
there's this airline saying you know
whenever you want to certify an airline
they're like this is not a business for
poor people if you're willing to get
into this business you're willing to
invest in how you have to build it and I
feel that companies in 2012 figured out
that what Apple did to come out from
complete oblivion a company that was
completely bankrupt into the most the
most valuable company in the world
currently was that they took their
precedent seriously they took their show
seriously and they took their the
handling of the press seriously and I
think that that's what these companies
are doing they're moving away from CES
hmm I think um I think that's a good way
to button it up I really see yes broker
they said well summed up and I'm happy
to have had the wisdom of you guys
who've attended many CES as before to
augment my own first-timer experience oh
my thing what phone had the best lamb
the experience cesium ZL yeah threat
really so Brandon yesterday was asking
like I'm trying to remember were the
ports of the seal where I'm like how
could you not remember if they've made
like the number-one buzzword for CES
like the bunch of sunny but flats like
those jammies that I dream it up an
access panel so well and it had that is
little bit like well you know it's they
did if you're using those jammies and
you're making that restroom trip in Las
Vegas just be prepared to walk six miles
okay for the butt flap and listeners
again it's a bit of great pleasure I I
apologize for my voice yesterday was
crazy when I'm I lost his voice
yesterday it was just not so he kept
telling me he's like he just wanted to
go home I only wanted to do and I like
it but we want to go hang out come on I
was like I've had
let's go you're a trooper York oh yeah
yeah they're there as well my closing
remarks will be there's still more from
CES again the event actually ends on
Friday we're actually going to hit the
show floor later on that's right to be a
lot more things we just needed to get
this podcast out because if not it was
never gonna happen it was never gonna
happen with so much we've gotta do i
need to go deal with the whole cesspools
videos but but it's been a real pleasure
sharing the show floor with you guys
likewise yeah I mean it's interesting
that and this is just the thing I mean I
there's this Latin American channel that
are all our Latin American listeners
would know about which is when you soon
and it was interesting because these
guys I felt really good because these
guys were with an army of reporters so
here it's the army of camera people and
an army of dated equipment right and for
a minute there I saw us three at the
press room by our with our sony and buy
art buy our 24th video already right and
I was like man this is awesome we are
better equipped yeah then this army yeah
and we actually proved that with what we
did i'm really proud of what we did I
mean I feel that even though CES was not
as impressive as I expected it to be I
feel that we we did an amazing job
yesterday and I hope that you listeners
I hope that you feel the same because we
can really yeah we busted up those oh
yeah and and listeners thank you for
