pocketnow podcast I'm Brandon minimun
editor-in-chief of pocketnow.com also on
the line we have Evan managing editor of
pocket now say hi hi guys hi Brandon hey
and we've got Tony senior editor for
pocket now say hi Tony hey guys hey
Brandon have a nice to be here yes
indeed so sounded very authentic thank
you very much did you as always it was
that written down before you yeah I
rehearsed some one hour before so I have
everything every topic in my head on
paper ready to go live okay even the
greeting even greeting will ever want to
appreciate that so it turns out that we
need a theme song for for the pocket
cast and we want to do Jennifer Lopez's
new song on the floor featuring pitbull
but there may be some copyright issues
with that you're using the royal we I
assume the what the royal we which means
you and not the rest of us yeah I don't
like that song either haha you don't
like that song why don't you why don't
you like that song it's gonna be so hot
I know it's gonna be hard but first of
all it's a remix of an 85 I think it was
85 already 89 even it was called Lambada
and I know yeah the tunes are okay it's
remix but couldn't Jennifer Lopez come
up with something original you know
musics not about originality it's about
you know selling music and getting
people interested with a right club Mia
you know cool club back bead and a
rapper and a you know yeah right the
beats are okay I mean big bullies okay
but it's maybe she's right something
which sold like crazy 120 years ago will
sell like crazy again 20 years after ah
are you talking about the the course
with the I can't sing so I'm not gonna
try but maybe I should help with the
accordion you know da-da-da-da-da
exactly yeah that's the song from 89 and
it's called Lambada and let me just look
it up I think the original artist on
that one was a Portuguese artist yeah
right here it's from 1989 and some
recorded by the French pop group called
coloma with the
Liam vocalist low alva bras so i don't
know if i spelled right well they're not
following you it also sounds like that
new shakira song it has the same sound
something like that yeah we should do a
poll havin do you know the shakira song
i'm talking about no i think the
difference though is that well maybe not
i mean should care married with
kids and I mean either seems like
neither of these women should be should
be singing about you know getting drunk
on the dance floor what would I could
say um yeah but uh anyway I think we
should move on but this song is it's
pretty catchy and if you haven't heard
it yet and you like sort of Club you
know techno like music with a little bit
of pop you like it so we were getting
some requests to release the pocket cast
on Google listen well Google listen
isn't a host it is just an application
Tony you know more about this right yeah
it's a free application it's on the
Google market I also made a video this
week no I think it was at the end of
last week what you have to do basically
is go into the Google market search for
google listen it's a free app downloaded
to your Android smartphone and if you
follow the steps which I've outlined in
my video add the certain RSS feed to
your subscriptions then you will
automatically get all the new episodes
as we release them yeah and what we're
going to start doing is put the is
putting the the feed directly into the
post about the pocket cast so you can
you can see it right there that's kind
of long and you can you know copy and
paste that into your interior Google
listen to listen to the the pocket cast
on and is there is there any any other
place where we are not present with the
bucket kissed we've got android itunes
soon directly on radio yet we're not
only really haven't heard of some
serious we're on our way to the radio
we'll have to look into that and then
maybe on TV yeah but that makes us look
you tube center to me youtube is the new
TV is
surprised they haven't made a youtube
branded TV yet huh isn't that what
Google to you yes oh yeah they did do
that Google TV um anyhow so what are we
starting today with gentlemen well I'm
hearing that you had a look at the
incredible s yeah tell me how it is
because everybody's crazy about the
incredible s especially that is coming
to the US yeah you know the incredible s
sort of by itself is a good is a great
device kind of like the Nexus S by
itself is a great device kind of like
the nexus one by itself as a great
device but if you compare it to what
else is out there right now it's not so
impressive anymore and if you look at
the price it's a little less impressive
when you consider the price so you know
we rated it a three-point no actually
three out of five because compared to
the other phones that are out there
right now The Incredible S has last
year's specs and last year software
doesn't even ship with Gingerbread at
this moment in time so kind of lukewarm
on it overall but it's got the
intelligent buttons but it has the
intelligent buttons which will amaze and
amuse your friends all night long so so
that's a so we're all just waiting for
the evo 3d now I guess or for HTC to
step it up yeah yeah the evo 3d on
sprint potentially announcing at ctia or
the pyramid which may actually be
somewhat related to the evo 3d we'll
find out we will find out okay next
thing we want to talk about we talked
about this a little bit last time about
Android force closing and sort of how
often it happens to you we we did a poll
on pocket now and the choices were or
the question start with the question how
often does your Android force close the
options were 44 fold several times per
day once per day one to two times per
week and rarely a third of people that
responded said it happens either once
per day or more and
other third said it happens one or two
times per week and another third set
rarely in your experience guys how often
do your Android's force close when you
use 14 for a while meaning force close
the app that you're currently on or
background apps anything just when you
see that dialogue well I mean I have
that program what's it called kill them
all or whatever so it I have it set to
regularly to kill the processes so i'm
not sure but i think it doesn't like
every half hour and it's fine with me I
rarely see it killing the app that's in
the forefront right right how about you
Tony well you know me I'm not an android
guy but i've been using android for
approximately four or five months last
year after the HTC Desire came to the
market and in those four or five months
I haven't actually seen an error or a
force close so um and this ship this
reminds me of Adam because I see so many
tweets and so many posts from him his
Android devices just just keep on dying
yeah horse blows errors and it never
happened to me I mean yeah it's stable
it's true that I never rooted one I
never installed so many applications but
basic email or other applications like
Twitter beep don't die on me yeah yeah
me too I think as you imply the better
applications out there the the ones that
get a lot of downloads because they're
supported by big companies they are very
very stable if you download you know a
fart app created by you know 14 year old
who was messing around with code one
afternoon you might get a force close
here and there I'm also surprised when i
hear adam say how often his androids
force close especially the mail program
so yeah the mail program you know
strange i don't know what it is it's a
power user he puts us to shame yeah he
he he simultext as kyocera you know i
created the term he somehow manages to
run two apps in parallel on the same
screen perhaps anyway
um let's just move on from that so let's
see on march 7th we were talking about
nokia getting paid a billion dollars to
align with microsoft and windows phone 7
and this was kind of new information
this is although I was suspected that
that they got paid if not the figure
wasn't known do you think that this
figure is higher than the expectation or
lower I think it's probably right around
what people were thinking in in a
billion dollar range you know yeah I
mean it had to be it had to be a big
number and Microsoft you know certainly
has cash lying around and the need for
our partners so that you know it seems
like with this new information nokia
becomes a bit more of a winner in this
although I'm still not sure how it's
gonna play out for them in the long run
yeah i mean what it's going to
presumably increase its research and
development with this billion dollars
and make make everything happen faster
but oh my wow billion dollars that's a
that's a lot of research and development
Wow yeah I mean I think you know the
probably used some of the money maybe to
pay off some debt and I know that they
had to use at least part of the money to
to bribe some of their their simian
developers I must put aside their me go
developers to stay to the end of the
year so that because I guess they're
they're really um they're fearing them a
brain drain so to speak where where
people are leaving because you know that
these developers they don't want to work
on Windows 17 but but nokia still has me
go device coming out this year and
obviously it needs developers to to
support the software on that device so
in some cases apparently it's offering i
think twice people's salaries for
anything over for them to stick around
through you know then december yeah it
could absolutely help with the with the
developer support and you know microsoft
even spent a lot of money on
developers before the launch of windows
phone 7 sending out the brand new
devices to them potentially paying some
of the big companies to make Windows
Phone 7 apps so that's a that's
definitely a big consideration Wow okay
so here's here's how I see things and
i'm going to start jerk mode as usual or
start evil mode i'm going to say that
microsoft paid 1 billion that's the news
we will never know whether it be half a
billion or two billion I'd say that some
people could look at it like this
Microsoft Paint ten percent more than
Google good one too I'm seeing this
let's say 1 billion as a short to medium
term loan nokia is having some financial
problems adopting windows phone 7 as a
primary platform requires lot of
investments in the development
departments in the production lines and
so on and so forth let's not forget that
at the keynote steven you up and Steve
Ballmer both said that there are certain
keys from the ecosystem of Microsoft
going to nokia and from Nokia coming to
Microsoft and we have been coming and
going we have Nokia Maps dld maps coming
and going so Microsoft might pay this
amount for some certain services which
we see or which we do not see from Nokia
to come to them additionally let's not
forget that Nokia will pay certain
licensing fees for every Windows Phone 7
they will produce and they will sell on
the market so a huge part of this
amounts will come back to Microsoft and
this is where I said that it might be a
short or medium term loan so good when
do we could see this from from lots of
perspectives now whether it's 1 billion
more or less we will never find out but
I'm sure that the it's more than Google
could have paid do we know how much Oh
a.m. sharp aying microsoft to license
windows phone 7 honestly I don't know
what I will look it up and maybe even
boast about this one that'd be great I
think for windows mobile I don't know
the exactly what I think was twenty to
forty dollars per unit that you know HDC
would pay to Microsoft when they sold
windows for windows mobile device okay
let's say the amount remain the same and
there was a news last week that Nokia is
targeting to convert approximately 200
million symbian users to Windows Phone
by the end of 2014 when I hopeful i
multiply that even half of that with
twenty dollars a piece and see what I'm
talking about my calculator doesn't
display that many numbers let's see here
200 I'm really bad at math let me see
200 times 20 times a million that's a
lot of zeros capture and we've got let's
see wow that's a big number um what
forty billion dollars yeah they will
most probably not make 200 million
symbian users go no i phone they will
maybe make a fourth or fifth part of
that but i think that will still cover
the 1 billion which microsoft paid to
nokia well let me ask you guys a
question do you think that the average
simeon user in europe because you know
that i'd say that's where the average
sabine user is would would prefer to to
move to Windows Phone 7 or prefer to
move to Android it all depends if we're
talking today they will most probably
move to Android if we are talking in
late october november or december when
we will see some nokia hardware with
Windows Phone 7 and mango then maybe
they might turn to to nokia and two
windows phone 7 yeah yeah it's all about
the hardware as as we like to say
Nokia's got to make some awesome windows
phone 7 hardware I mean is it is a
symbian is user devotion to the nokia
brand or to the symbian brand there's
there's um users that are devoted to
both but my porn here is that is that I
think Nokia made the wrong choice and
and I hope that billion dollars was
worth it because I think in the long run
it could have done a lot better off
becoming an Android OEM then then I'm
windows phone 7 you know even if if
outwardly it says it's going to be able
to distinguish itself more because there
are less
and you facturers less phones on the
market I mean it still seems like it
came down to a matter of money and you
know Microsoft was willing and you know
had the had a reason to pay more than an
Android which is which is taken off like
a rocket whether it pays people to use
it or not yeah I mean this is very
important move for for Microsoft and
when that happens they unload their a
barrel of cash and that's what they did
here so uh cool let us move on so iOS
4.3 was released for the iphone on it
looks like march nice so actually last
Wednesday Tony you can start it on your
iPhone what do you think about it hmm
interesting question now most of our
listeners and readers probably know that
I don't have that much experience with
the Apple iOS and Apple devices I've got
my iphone for last week or it was the
two weeks ago I've used iOS 4.2 4.1 for
three or four days before 4.3 came
online now there were a couple of things
which Apple advertised about it number
one was a faster Safari due to some
improvements in the Java section I can
tell you that it's probably not visible
to the eye but if our listeners have
checked our comparison between the LG
optimus 7 and the samsung omnia 7 if i
was to load the same pages in sync
between either of the windows phone 7
devices and the iphone I'd see the
iphone would load them faster so
definitely Safari is faster than them
internet explorer in its current version
on windows phone 7 another one was the
personal hotspot feature which many many
many users have have wanted and I've
just discussed this with the Evan this
morning that was asking because he has
an iphone for way longer than I do right
after I received the update I had the
personal hotspot option available and I
think I've even showed it to you Brandon
and ever since yesterday it vanished
from my phone they don't find it in
settings I don't find it so it vanished
I even
I resented i reinstalled everything I
reinstall the applications i restored
from backup and it turns out that well
reading on the forums my carrier does
not support tethering even more my
carrier doesn't even support iPhones so
the big question is why was personal
hotspot in the settings working and
tested I better to an Android device and
it was working and then the other day
it's vanished so it's a big question for
me wow that's and some crazy stuff I
wonder how the carrier presumably
remotely disable your tethering I
realize you went through this I'm sorry
can we well I don't know it's it's a
such a small and new cat carrier here in
Romania that I don't think that they
even know about tethering and iOS 4.3
with all due respect to this carrier I'm
talking about they only sell or let's
say they give out free feature phones
from Chinese companies like that te and
Hugh way we so they're really on the
start maybe as you imply that maybe they
they saw some activity on the network
ever since 4.3 came out they made the
connection and they disabled it hmm but
I would have to be Apple that did that
because this the first carrier doesn't
even offer the iphone 4 it's gonna have
no way to access people's iphones on its
network right then how would exactly
Apple disable it on my phone not even
knowing that i'm using his smartphone on
an unknown network so many question
marks here and another thing which which
is new in the iOS 4.3 which i'm about to
test then I will even post a video on
pocketnow.com is about wireless sharing
of your library from itunes to your
smartphone so i will make a video and
check that out somewhere this week on
pocket naw Kham another thing if you
could check out engadget was posting
about how to enable those hidden
multi-touch gestures in iOS 4.3 they
posted about for the ipad but i'm sure
it could work on the on the ids is the
same thing do you have do you have to
jailbreak your device but yeah which is
something you know I never
root level jailbreak and I never install
harliss feel but I will I will try to do
that that make a video demonstration
that would be really really cool touche
me after jailbreak it to do that but I
guess it's not the worst thing in the
world okay that's that's Apple that's
Apple a shame i think it's great the
first thing i do with these devices is
jailbreak them even if you don't do
anything after that he just jailbreak it
yeah I was gonna say I mean when I first
jailbroke the iphone there was i didn't
have a need to do it you know I I wasn't
even using any jailbroken apps or
functionality it was just sort of like I
don't want to have doesn't it's not
completely open to me at least
theoretically helps me sleep at night I
I was just gonna say it helps you
breathe it helps your uh your lung
capacity somehow yeah um that made no
sense let's move on shall we um so ctia
is coming up Evan what day do you leave
its next week right yeah I believe it's
the 20th you are leaving this sunday and
we expect to see at least something from
HTC the nexus s 4g and the evo 3d from
Sprint and now posted last week we're
talking about potentially two new LG
devices although we only have a hunch of
what one could be which is the tmobile
g2x interest I really new I'm sorry oh
god it's gonna say I mean that's that's
not really a new device it's a device we
already know about that's that's been
granted for a domestic carrier yeah so
so confirmation that we will indeed see
that and we really haven't talked much
about the g2x it will be I of course a
t-mobile version of the optimus 2x a
dual-core LG phone and this is yet
another example of a carrier taking a
brand the G brand and having other OEMs
not just one come out with the hardware
for it so we had the the g one which is
HTC the g2 which was HTC and now the g
two x which is going to be GG and you
don't forget the G tablet which is also
LG
ah there you go the G tablet so it's
always interesting to see how the
carrier's sort of use branding and
change their strategy for that do you
think if HTC had at this moment a dual
core smartphone that maybe t-mobile
would have went with his brand of for
the g and with HTC as OEM probably right
I don't I think it all depends on the
carrier's relationships with the
manufacturers at a given moment and
right now it's a half history right
t-mobile and HTC yeah yeah but for for a
device like but you know what's
essentially going to be um I'm thinking
of the the evo 3d well I mean I would
assume that if that's a dual-core device
you know that may have been on the table
for four tmobile as well but it seems
like HTC is is putting some of their
their best stuff on spur first right at
the point maybe that that relationship
has been the most fruitful for them you
know even if even if you know HTC has a
has a dual core phone coming out at ctia
it's very possible that LG said hey we
can get this you know optimus 2x ready
sooner for you t mobile and HTC said we
won't be ready for this until the summer
time and t-mobile wanted they need to
have a super powerful phone on their on
their in their portfolio because you've
got verizon coming up with a dual core
smartphone you've got eighteen t with
dual core sprint is going to have these
new these new devices and so t-mobile
needed something to compete yeah I think
also wasn't wasn't t-mobile the first to
launch with an optimist one variant here
in the US with the optimus t I think yes
right that's obviously been successful
for them so you know that you know what
why not go back to LG for for more stuff
there you go it's fun to figure stuff
out here so we do at least we're trying
we see
yeah we may be completely wrong about
everything but we pretend like we know
what we're talking about all right let's
move on iOS 5.0 rumors are starting
although they've been around for
probably months now as soon as you know
one version is released we're already
talking about the next and it's possible
that there could be an event in April
where where they talk about not only the
iphone 5 but iphone or iOS 5 point what
is on your wish list guys for for iOS
5.1 thing they must include in this new
version of the software well i think is
the gestures having to jailbreak for for
the multi finger gestures is a little
bit crazy we have talked about gestures
i think for a couple of months now and
we were all hyped up that the 4.3 will
bring them and there's no gestures in
stock 4.3 so we might see gestures on
five point oh but i don't think there
will be an event in april my personal
opinion is that we will see an
announcement of iOS 5 at the same moment
or at least a little bit preceding the
announcement for the next generation of
iphone because there will be some other
implications it's not going to be only
the software it's going to be tied to
the hardware too so this is how I see
things when was the UM the iphone 4
event anyone remember what month it was
in juneau july i think i can find out in
two seconds well actually it's good beer
you have access to the internet world
yeah they they installed it just
yesterday what's under that what does
internet here it is okay it was really
ok announced june seventh 2010 ok and
then it went on sale at the end of june
or in july jun 24 ok that's sort of
interesting so Apple went from from
quite a big lead with the first iphone i
mean it was announced in january and it
didn't come out till june of that year
22 less than a month now
yeah and one of the one of the
manufacturers they just weapons against
um against the sites like ours and
engadget gizmodo or all the other phone
sites is that the one of their weapons
against um these leaks of products is
that they've been announcing and they're
on their upcoming devices a lot earlier
than in the past you know I remember
Apple used to an end that still does
sometimes it that launched them devices
on the same day that they go on sale and
and that seems to be less the case on
both with apple and other manufacturers
now you know we saw all these devices at
CES that that weren't going to be ready
for months and and and I think it makes
it easier for the manufacturers and the
carriers to UM sort of beat beat us at
our own game yeah if you look at a the
release cycle given the iPad it was it
was released on april third 2010 but it
was announced in in march sort of around
the same time the ipad 2 was announced
in 2011 and now you know Steve Jobs was
talking about a device that was shipping
one week later so so sort of this this
tightening of release cycles between
announcement and release is definitely
getting smaller hopefully we have
thankfully some leaks from China and
Hong Kong and from the supply chain
which can give us early indications of
what's coming yeah thank goodness for
those bras it was to go if I can just
open for another minute because um it
there's obviously the benefit to
manufacturers for for an ounce and
earlier but there's there's also a huge
drawback and that's that that people
aren't going to be as excited or is
willing to put money down for current
generation devices if they know that in
you know a month two months even three
months you know most people could hold
out for for something that they know is
going to be a lot better and probably
the same price as as hardware that's out
today so what do you think the ideal
threshold is to not only prevent leaks
but to keep consumer excitement up
not sure actually it wasn't ugly model
sorry no one I mean you're you're never
going to be able to to keep these
devices out of the hands of testers and
the people who are building them and
whatever so so there's always going to
be leaks in the matter when you launch I
think you're never going to get rid of
that but I mean that I think that what
you asked is a calculation that each
company has to do you know based on
their sides and their current product
portfolio and how much they need a hit
and there's so many variables that that
play into that calculation I don't think
it's going to be the same for each
company I like to approach my world with
you know one one end or the other and i
would say that there there is an ideal
threshold and i think it's probably one
week or two weeks because of course what
happens is when HDC announces phones
that aren't going to be ready for two
three four months that really influences
people's buying decision they already
know what HTC is coming down the pipe
like four months from now but if you go
with the company that releases things or
announces things and then releases them
almost immediately it's almost like you
want to hold out longer to see what that
company has in store rather than buy the
product that was announced three months
ago which now seems kind of stale
remember though Brandon that that the
later in the in the production cycle
that the product gets announced that the
more people that have had their hands on
it more people have been testing it the
more likely it love been to have been
leaked you know what I mean if you're if
you're announcing a product today that's
going to be launched in a week or two
you know there's there's already boxes
of that product probably in
manufacturers warehouses well I'm so in
factory warehouse is well you know if
you announced a couple months ahead of
time it's much less likely that there's
going to be good spy shots of the
products I mean if we look at some of
the stuff that got announced at CES some
of it we just didn't we've never seen
you know the droid bionic we had no idea
about the inspire 4G well I mean that's
basically a desire HD at that
that wasn't even known about until the
day before hand so so they're they're
doing a good job with with these with
these with these large gaps um stuff is
you know that it's being it's effective
in that in that respect and that there's
there's less stuff leaking out ahead
ahead of time nowadays do you guys
remember in time when this stuff didn't
happen I mean there were these you know
consumer electronics there were there
was a new computer at least and the
companies would it hold a press event
for it and there wouldn't be spy shots
they just released the thing and put it
up for sale when they were they were
done yeah well wouldn't have a name that
consumers could remember either you know
it wasn't until i think motorola really
changed this with with their with their
razor and their riser and whatnot but
but most consumer electronics used to be
named by these look long you know model
numbers now it's only recently that that
every single phone has a real you know
english name and Ahmed's them that's
extended to other products too and
they're very feel good names like the
inspire and the oh yeah the incredible
and this you know the desire desire yeah
it's so funny I want to hear like the
razor edge or the scalpel or something
they did have a scalpel the SCP I'll the
Moto Snapple oh yeah the the feature
phone yeah but there are a few things I
want to say here that the first one is
that sometimes or maybe even most of the
times leaking out a shot or picture or a
design of an upcoming device is in the
best interest of the OEM and in many
many cases we see even OEM doing the
leaks themselves remember me I think it
was the thunderbolt which got the leaks
directly from HTC this is number one and
getting back to brendans question which
was the optimal threshold for for
leaking out or for announcing for
between announcing and availability I
think it's one or two weeks I agree with
that and it's definitely not what's
happening with the verizon Thunderbolt I
mean I don't know with all the hype
around it for like six months who's
gonna actually buy the device yeah let's
let's talk about the Thunderbolt it's
been delayed yet again and the days are
considered a delay if if there no it was
never announced when it was going to
launch so any of these supposed to
delays or just internal yeah but they
write the perception was that it was
going to be released maybe februari and
somehow that perception was treated and
I think it's the way the company was
talking about the product you're right
they never officially announced a date
but it's all about perception and people
think that this phone is just late it's
it's nothing official but it's hurting
the product and it's hurting the bread
yeah it is a little bit there so so
March seventeenth I we've heard that
date from a lot of different places and
that seems to be that's in three days
from now seems to be via the time it'll
hit ok lr was seared Oh continue sorry
I'll receive a lot of hate mail I'm just
going to say that I don't believe there
will be a march seven theme for the
funderbolt the one of them well why is
that because there was a certain
interview or they was a certain
statement from from the CEO of horizon I
think and there were some problems
besides the battery problem which was
rumored verizon might have some problems
with the LTE infrastructure itself they
might have those models ready and going
they might have the service in certain
regions of the states but I don't think
that a certain battery problem build
problem application problem could create
such a big hype and such a big delay
even if it's delay from a rumor I iris I
sort of almost respect that that a
company wouldn't ship a product that
couldn't take advantage of a new
technology because I am increasingly
frustrated and I bring this up every
week Evan knows
Yeah right I didn't even have to wait
for you to bring it up tonight it's got
to happen every time I was on a conquest
this weekend to find hspa+ it's like
Where's Waldo okay so I I drove from
Philadelphia to New York I happen to be
going to to a wedding but that really
wasn't the most important part haha i
was i was on a quest to find the hspa+ I
benchmarked in the outer part of
Pennsylvania all through New Jersey and
up into brooklyn Long Island and and
also there's another Island i was i was
present in and and no there was no hspa+
there is no AT&amp;amp;T 4g and if anyone out
there has experienced their hspa+
network please send us a benchmark
picture because i'm still getting at
best one point five megabits per second
down and like 200 kilobits per second up
and I and I take out any other phone on
AT&amp;amp;T 3g network and i get double triple
those speeds it's just so funny that the
phone that's supposed to be faster is
slower but this is somewhat normal
brendan if you if you remember two weeks
ago we have talked about the inspire 4G
having a registry edits or registry
tweak applies to disabled the best beads
now of course the carrier went on saying
that they are not capping speeds and
they're everywhere with the high-speed
infrastructure but i think that the
software itself has a limitation which
does not allow you to take full
advantage of the higher speeds which the
carrier offers well here's the thing
about that the the limitation of the
hsupa which is limiting the upload
speeds that is a 3g technology I don't
really care about 3g this isn't a 3g
phone this is a 4g phone it's almost a
moot point that's so you're not even
getting downloads what's that you're not
even getting download speeds what do you
mean I mean is your download even lower
than it would be on a non 4g device it
is
but to be honest I don't really care I
wanted to just be 4g I don't care if
it's you know not 3g although it's
insulting that it's not even 3g it's
like a 2.5 g phone so the hsupa thing
doesn't bother me that much I don't
think that's the real story the real
story is that AT&amp;amp;T or at least 2 4g
phones when there is no 4g it's it's not
it's not in existence and its really
bothersome but i think we should move on
because i think we've said enough um
yeah we're never gonna get another
review unit if we keep bad-mouthing yeah
yeah yeah hopefully AT&amp;amp;T is not
listening I've had a lot of good
experience with 18 teams in the past but
this this 4G thing is rub me the wrong
way I don't think they they are we to
get to the market oh absolutely i mean
that's the story here verizon's taking
their time because they want to make
sure they get it right and you know
there's a competitive advantage to being
first and to getting it out you know
before another company and isn't this
hurting more AT&amp;amp;T than if let's say they
would have waited two or three months
it's tough to say but that would be my
guess I don't know again I'm Brennan
we've talked about this before we're
sort of in this in this bubble here
where we think that that the whole world
knows about these little issues that we
talk about but the fact is that that
they really don't and I think the
average consumer needed to see AT&amp;amp;T do
something even you know they're not
running bandwidth cats they just want to
see that that AT&amp;amp;T is in the game at
that you know sprint and rising into
mobile are in yeah I agree to some
extent although if you're buying and
inspire 4G or especially an Atrix 4G
you've got to be somewhat aware of
what's going on and and you're probably
likely to think about running a speed
test because you must be curious about
your 4g phone well anyway let us let us
move on awesome alone let's move on on
March 11th talking about skyfire
four-point-oh coming to android we've
talked about skyfire before and it's
been interesting to watch the company
about just you know two or three years
ago skyfire if you thought a sky fire
you thought of speed they did
server-side rendering to allow pages to
through faster and on windows mobile it
was a very very good experience and then
they changed their model than they had a
iOS release that cost I think it was one
or two dollars that some people like
some people didn't and they're sort of
new model is that they they kind of put
a twist on web browsing there's a little
bar on the bottom where you can share
your web pages which I'm not even sure
anyone wants to do you know it's nice to
email a page but he's really going to
tweet facebook chat you know read later
all these different things on a in a
browser I don't know and they also added
you know video playing flash your video
playing so it didn't really work too
well in the beginning on iOS at least it
would extract the video open up a
dedicated player and stream you the
content so that we lost in you or yeah
or it wouldn't even work but that was in
the beginning have you have either of
you tried skyfire on iOS recently I have
no how is it I shouldn't say recently
but I did try a couple a couple weeks or
months after um after it was released on
iOS and after they had given it an
update you know a chance and it did work
a little better but there was so quite a
few videos that it just timed out on and
in general I mean that's that's not the
type of browsing experience I'm looking
for you know for me good flash
integration is being able to do it in
the page now i am in sort of a separate
fabric player and i also want to be able
to see other other implementations of
flash other than just videos which I
aren't that probably more important to
me on a on a day-to-day browsing basis
like I'm on video uses a flash plus the
the older version of or i should say the
older model of skyfire used to on you
know you used to run like silver light
and job it just had you know it was
really full featured a night and it
became a lot less full-featured and they
started charging for it and and they
kind of support for some of their old
users so in my mind sky fires just
started making one mistake after another
and they can afford it i guess because
people are buying
this browser left and right yeah I mean
the they were the first third-party
browser for iOS isn't that right I
believe opera mobile was first drop of
mini and then not open the door Chris
got fire yeah but I think sky fire was
the first one to claim to be able to do
flash and that was that earlier that was
great marketing I mean people wanted to
that's a story you can tell and and
that's probably why skyfire for iOS has
been relatively successful although
users aren't you know you nanima the
what's that word you Nana Melissa T
unanimously unanimously thank you
everybody that word in regard to school
you oh man anyhow so if it worked out
word on the street is that they're going
to start charging for their android
version with the next skyfire
four-point-oh and that there will be
killer features now guys what can you
think of that would be a killer feature
and a web browser oh it all depends I'm
the other way around Evan said that he
likes flash integration into the web
page now no I don't like that because if
you have flash integration in your
Safari or in your opera or in your sky
fire you have all the ads and all the
flash animations which one make your
device lower to bump up your data
consumption and three lower your battery
usage I like the way Safari implements a
separate viewing of let's say YouTube
videos which are embedded in a page
number two we are heading towards a new
standard which is html5 and html5
everybody knows that is rather
competitive and it's it will be kicking
some Adam flesh but so what I'm saying
here that it it all comes down to user
preference Evan most likely will
probably pay for a skyfire version for
because he likes integration of flesh
into this pages and he doesn't want to
go outside of the browser to see a video
i will most
we not do that because I prefer to have
a clean look of the page and control
what's playing and was changing on that
surging page I wish I could get my money
back for that I paid for skyfire already
I'm not being good there you know so
Evan what do you think's a killer
feature that sky fire could have in four
point 0 for android could be maybe
extensions or yeah you know extensions
widgets whatever you want to call it
that something that that brings in an
API some some user develop content I'm
sort of like what what fire box right on
Android yeah yeah that's that's exactly
what comes to mind but they they're
still in beta mode with the Firefox for
Android a really cool browser that
allows you to plug in some extensions
like you can for firefox on the desktop
but they've been taking their sweet
sweet sweet sweet time with coming up
with the final version and I think a lot
of people want it so you know I'm people
donating their time right I mean it's
not it's not a company / say like well
it is a company Mozilla but but but a
lot of this is volunteer work you know
these people just people have other jobs
coding in your spare time as opposed to
to a sky fire and opera where you know
those are our for-profit companies that
are better you know working on this day
in a day out right well if the you know
those contributing to Mozilla can make
an awesome browser like Firefox for
which I recommend to anyone listening
it's really come a long way hopefully
they can get their get their act
together to do to do the mobile version
to answer my own question what would be
a killer feature in a mobile browser I
think it's two things one really really
really good tab of management and I
think that you know dolphin HD has
really good tab management with tabs on
the top but that that paradigm doesn't
always work because there's not enough
screen screen real estate there's none
of pixels set to have a desktop like
browsing experience the way HTC the way
Apple does tabs is so annoying you have
to go into another screen you filter
between them it's not fast enough ish
so I want to see awesome tab management
number two I want to see just a really
good rendering engine we have these very
powerful devices and yet if you go to a
long page with lots of graphics like
engadget and you flick down really fast
even on the iphone 4 even on the Nexus S
you get some of that checkerboards which
is just kind of annoying and surprising
at this point so those are the two
things that I think skyfire should could
innovate on but they're going to have
like all these features and these
buttons and well we'll see what happens
with that right do okay let us move on
the next thing we wanted to talk about
Samsung Infuse 4G Oh another AT&amp;amp;T 4G
phone but but this time it's got a 4.5
inch screen oh one of the largest
screens if you don't consider the dell
streak to come to smartphones and it's
got a very thin bezel so it's a
relatively pocketable device do you guys
think that uh means the infuse 4g is
gonna be big well gary said it was big
brandon its work ah there you go but I'm
um we got to have some sound effects
next time so we can fit to the drum
because I think it'll be big and I think
it'll be popular again you know they're
there was a question when remember when
that the hd2 came out you know or the
touch HD or whatever you know where
people going to are people going to be
into a 4.3 inch screen and they totally
work you know and that became the norm
in fact so so if they can keep basically
the same form factor just bring the
screen closer to the edges yeah I don't
see any reason why people wouldn't want
a device like that I i agree i think
that a bigger is better to a point in
terms of smartphone screens and you know
4.3 inches is such a great size compared
to even four-point inch four-point-oh
inch I know some people will disagree
the iphones 3.5 inch screen seems so
small but 4.5
it may be a little too big maybe maybe
not what do you think Tony well it's for
me at least personally it is it is too
big because my sweet spot is somewhere
around 3.7 3.8 and I think that
everything beyond 4 is too big we're
seeing a certain trend smartphones get
larger and larger screens and tablets
get smaller and smaller screens so we
might see a point where these two might
reach the same diagonal but honestly a
4.5 inch screen will be at least as big
as the dell venue pro or the samsung
galaxy s2 even bigger and that's a huge
plastic bulk to carry around even if
it's thin even if it's light it's a huge
screen there's no more privacy everybody
sees what you what you have on your
screen so maybe it comes down to
personal preference I wouldn't buy a 4.5
inch screen phone yeah um hmm I gotta
bring this up I just saw a article hit
the hit our Twitter from into mobile
this this looks interesting it has to do
with 4g on AT&amp;amp;T I just got it I got it I
got a gun so that the topic is eighteen
t 4G network is anything but 4G they've
got some quotes here from pc magazine
here's the quote from pc magazine AT&amp;amp;T
is lying about 4g shamelessly the
companies to quote 4g phones and it's
quote 4g modem don't deliver 4g even by
AT&amp;amp;T zone wishy-washy standards
unfortunately there's no such thing as
the 4g police and 18 tds going to get
away with the basing the term and
confusing consumers to everyone's
disadvantage and they they cite the
atrix 4g and the inspire 4g all right
sorry but I had to I just I said bad too
okay let's take some questions on
Twitter the first one here will will
send to the Tony it's from mr. kazoo can
you remote desktop in windows phone 7
and if not is this a feature we're
likely to see in the future well there's
an application which is I believe fade
and it costs a lot of money
beyond I think nineteen or twenty
dollars which allows you to remote
desktop with your windows 7 and if
there's a certain man that will probably
make a video of it it works pretty much
like all other remote controlling
gatwick issues it connects to your
desktop and it all comes down to this
queen-size you can control the
applications your desktop basically from
your windows phone 7 if it comes
natively on Windows Phone 7 from
Microsoft or a third party application
for free I'd say no or at least not in
the near future because you know yeah go
on I'll just connect what is the name of
this application well I'm going to look
it up and we will have to post the link
to the marketplace link in our post with
a bucket guest that'd be great I've seen
it it's it's a it's pretty expensive for
what it does I mean I don't want to base
some fifteen or twenty bucks for for an
application just to control my pc
remotely I don't want to do that yeah
yeah I mean remote desktop on on a phone
is sort of magic the first time you do
it because you get this link you get the
start menu on the bottom or if you're
using a Mac you get the you know the
other components of the Mac but doc and
whatnot and it's just so interesting
because it's like I mean three or four
years ago when you could do this on a
smartphone it was so futuristic but the
truth is that there's almost no almost
no use for desktop in most cases on a
phone it's cold exactly remote desktop
I'm having I'm looking at it right now
it costs 1499 and well I don't want to
pay that amount for for controlling my
desktop even if it's from the kitchen or
from the other way get a part of the
city yeah it's just a little bit too
much there next question is from mobile
Dom simple question for me is your LG
Panther still working and do you still
use it the answer is no the LG Panther
was a developer device ceded to certain
developers back in the summer and I used
it for a period of time did some videos
but then I sent it back to the guy that
that sent it to me tony has a tailor
which of course was the other windows
phone 7 device are you
getting the same updates on your tailor
Tony as well I think I'm having some
problems with the tailor because
whenever i try to connect via zune and
check for updates it gives me a can't
connect ever and i think this comes down
to the fact that sometimes if you
remember there was a leak from the
Samsung and Microsoft ROM which emulated
and showed copy paste and maybe they
might have blocked that certain feature
maybe I will have to try to look for a
rom update from the developer part
because these are developer devices but
the table works just fine it's it's got
the 7000 for built on it supposed to be
status 7008 which is the pre know to
update and interestingly enough it was a
device which I like very much because it
was fluid it was great build quality but
it had a certain front-facing camera and
I was wondering whether it was built
like this on purpose IE will there be
front-facing camera support in Windows
Phone 7 or not or it was just the an old
chest which samsung decided to build the
phone on I'm a question for you Tony got
to go um you know why they named this
one um no donuts is it was it you know
there's there's a google there's a story
know there's a funny story behind this
there was an actual microsoft meeting
and somebody at a certain point was sent
out to bring donuts and he wouldn't he
or she wouldn't go so this story might
be true or not I might know the true
version or not of the story but they
have decided to call it no though or no
donuts with no relationship at all and
no connections to android although donut
was the first named update wasn't it um
no I don't think so donut was the nurse
okay before that right yeah yeah cool
what's up let's move on to the next
question from that's a baby boo should
we be excited that dual core now should
we be excited about dual core when it
even supported in the software until
honeycomb I'll answer first and you guys
can chime in if you want yes and no no
if you want the phone to be faster in
things like email web browsing basically
the built-in applications because
there's not that much of a difference
with the dual core but if you do a lot
of video stuff like watching videos
playing video games then the answer is
yes in fact they now have TegraZone
which points you to Tengger to optimized
games and on the zoom for example this
is this is a true story you get some
really stunning games through the
TegraZone and you can do the same on a
dual-core phone but in terms of
day-to-day use right now there's not
that big of a difference with these dual
core phones I agree so without without
any support from the platform from the
OS itself there is no need for a dual
core processor yeah it would be a
definite need for a 1.3 1.5 single core
processor that would speed up
application those times on the basic
platform level but as far as games are
concerned as you said the TegraZone and
the application market which filters out
the high-end applications for high-end
devices takes advantage of those do our
core smartphones but it's all about
gaming if we talk about day-to-day usage
I think it would be beneficial to come
out with a one-point something single
core processor which would be faster
than the one gigahertz nap fragments
we're used to yeah exactly i mean my you
know this dis inspire 4g if we don't
talk about data speeds it's it's really
fast it's got the latest single core
Qualcomm processor day-to-day operations
it is it is bloody fast and last time I
used a motorola atrix 4g it felt slower
so there you go one more question and
again this one goes to Tony it's from
coke ev3 is it possible for Microsoft to
release hot fixes for wp7 that would
bypass the carrier testing phase in case
of a severe bug I think not
and this is because the very very strong
relationship between Microsoft and the
carriers so as far as i know and i might
be wrong but from what my logic tells me
is that Microsoft is gathering together
all the bits of a new update sends it
out to the certain carrier for testing
and when that certain carrier approves
the update then gives the flag to
Microsoft which then gives the flag for
the devices to update themselves without
the carrier it will be not possible it
might be possible for for those devices
which are not carrier bound which are
unlocked but then again it all comes
down to fragmentation we might see some
devices running one certain build and
other devices other builds and that's
not what Microsoft once at the moment so
my thoughts and my conclusion is that we
will not see updates bypass carriers
there we go there we go very good well
that concludes the pocket cast episode 7
thank you gentlemen for joining me as
always thanks / thank you very much and
thanks everybody for listening you know
we do this because you listened so thank
you so much for your support and
listening to the pocket cast and we'll
see you next time that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
