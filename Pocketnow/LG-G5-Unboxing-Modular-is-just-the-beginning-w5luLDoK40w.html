all year so is the UPS guy that brings
you your LG g5 to the front door I'm
every better with pocket now and it's
time for an unboxing I don't know about
you but I set my alarm for 7:00 a.m.
today because I knew UPS next day early
means the package has to arrive before
8:00 and it did not every phone would be
as important for me to bother but this
is not every phone cutting the express
box open we're greeted with more than
just another box an extra care package
includes a spare battery and an external
battery charging cradle which is a great
addition pace it on the back we even
notice a USB type-c adapter to micro USB
in case you want to use any existing
wires even better this cradle can even
serve as an external battery pack for
either a phone or the LG Chem plus if
you choose to buy separately and now for
what we've been waiting for the LG g5
it's presented in a very neat and thick
cardboard box with color elements that
match LG's new focus arm green or lime
the separation between layers of the
cardboard even hints to the separation
between the phone's chassis and the
bottom slot that still doesn't really
have an official name slide the box open
and we're greeted with a usual AT&amp;amp;T
documentation and the LG g5 right below
it if you dig deeper you'll notice the
usual literature you won't really read
and then the USB type-c cable which
actually ends in regular USB this allows
the charger to remain regular USB which
also means you can actually use your
legacy wall warts our LG g5 / u unit
comes in Titan color which is another
way to say Space Gray for those of you
switching from the Apple world and
before we continue let's get rid of all
the sir plastic shall we
oh yeah
the Titan finishes not only darker than
standard aluminum but it also does an
amazing job at shifting tones when
exposed to warm light the effect is
really cool that cool feeling extends to
the materials when touched and it only
gets better once you've pushed the
button at the bottom to reveal LG's new
approach to expandability this slot not
only allows you to replace your battery
but can be replaced by LG's cam plus
module in addition to the audio deck
which you can also buy separately and
while we're talking about expandability
the only thing we don't notice in the
box is a sim ejector tool which is
rather odd I'm glad I always come
prepared and once you push it in and
you'll notice that LG has decided over a
horizontal design for the sin tray
instead of vertical which makes it
easier to push it back in the LG g5 is
definitely unlike every other smartphone
this year the company has addressed the
horrible antenna lines we're used to
seeing and competing devices with a neat
little trick we'll discuss later it
offers a replaceable everything without
compromising in the design and that dual
camera at the back is something we
cannot wait to test it's even hard to
compare the g5 against its predecessor
so this is gonna be a rather interesting
review period if you're joining us in
getting the g5 early keep in mind that
every US carrier is offering different
deals some are gonna offer the spare
battery and the charging cradle and
others are even bundling the LG 360
camera whatever the case may be we are
looking into an awesome couple of weeks
