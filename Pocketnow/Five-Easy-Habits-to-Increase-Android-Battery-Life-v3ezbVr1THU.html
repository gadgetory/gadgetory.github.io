life on your Android phone I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and these are
five easy habits to improve Android
battery life with the exception of
tablets and a few different smartphone
models battery life on Android is widely
accepted as rather poor for many a full
day of use without needing a
supplementary charge is a pipe dream
created in the wake of hundreds of
thousands of BlackBerry converts who
took battery life for granted
unfortunately there's no magic trick to
make your phone last days upon days on a
single charge unless of course you're
okay with cutting off data and leaving
in your pocket the whole time but that
defeats the purpose of having a smart
phone your best bet is to adopt some
simple habits that help curb battery
drain throughout the day the first of
those habits should be learning to
toggle settings and connections on as
you need them for example flipping on
Wi-Fi when you get home is probably
second nature but getting into the habit
of turning it off as you walk at the
door might save some battery the same
stands for Bluetooth GPS and even 4G all
of these connections sip into your
battery throughout the day and if you're
not using them you might as well turn
them off for those who don't want to
have to remember this is why
applications like Tasker exist Tasker is
an automation application that allows
users to program their phone to carry
out tests based on other interactions or
statuses for instance I have my phone
set up to toggle Wi-Fi off and Bluetooth
on when I open Spotify since that's how
I listen to music in the car I also have
it set to turn on GPS and Wi-Fi when I
open Maps since both of these improved
location services but if you're not
looking to spend hours programming
simple profiles and tasks for your phone
to follow through different use cases
simple widgets or paying the settings
application a quick visit can accomplish
the same thing so long as your memory
serves you well one of the main causes
of battery drain is the display
especially in most recent models with
five inch or larger displays and a 1080p
pixel resolution jacking the brightness
up to 100% will likely result in you
being able to watch your remaining
charge disappear before your eyes for
most hours of the day I keep my display
set to auto brightness this saves
battery by adjusting the intensity of
the brightness based on ambient lighting
once the Sun Goes Down however I drag
the brightness slider all the way to the
left as low as it will go
it's also a good idea to keep the
display timeout set to one minute or
less sitting down your phone with its
display left on will cause unnecessary
power drain or of course you could
simply remember to bump the power button
before you setting your phone down again
if this is something you can't remember
to do you can create a task or profile
to adjust your screens brightness based
on time location and a host of other
variables Android typically does a great
job of managing RAM and keeping tabs on
things
it keeps performance up and kills off
any unnecessary background processes but
sometimes applications get out of hand
and they can take charge of your device
even without opening an application one
could be taking up RAM in the background
and likewise chewing through your
battery it's wise to keep an eye on your
battery usage which is a built-in
function of Android if an application
you don't recall using has caused an
alarming amount of battery drain you can
either for stop it or if you don't need
it uninstall it you can also install
applications like watchdog which will
monitor applications and notify you when
one has gone rogue despite what you've
been told you don't really need to
condition your battery at least not that
often it's not a bad idea to let it
drain all the way when you first get it
but it's not entirely necessary there
are no real side-effects of not doing it
those who say you should let your phone
completely die and likewise those who
say you should never let your phone's
battery drain completely all wrong most
modern smartphones are powered by
lithium-ion cells to prolong the
battery's lifespan it's best to give
your battery some exercise don't fall
into a routine plug it up when it's
almost dead next time
charge it when it's near 50% let it die
completely from time to time and don't
be afraid to top off before you leave
the house or office no battery is gonna
last forever but charging a lithium-ion
battery exactly the same every time can
negatively impact the longevity so
change it up often and don't leave it
plugged in all the time lastly and
unfortunately one of the greatest
aspects of Android the utility of its
home screen is also one of the many
culprits to blame for battery drain
widgets and live wallpapers can both be
useful and look cool but they can also
drain battery the more you have running
on your home screens the more drain
you're likely going to see there's no
need to go off the deep end and delete
everything off your home screen but if
you have widgets or icons
not using remove them from the
homescreen and simply rely on the app
drawer to do its job I for one have
consolidated my homescreen down to a
single page with two simple widgets and
a row of folders my absolute bare
minimum these steps aren't gonna make
your phone last days on end but it might
be just enough to make your phone last
throughout the day so that's it for this
