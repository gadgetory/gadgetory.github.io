to the first episode ever of pocket now
VIP where we're going to sit down and
hang out with the biggest names in
mobile tech I'm Brandon minimun
editor-in-chief of pocket now and with
me I've got a guy that you've seen
before if you have access to an internet
connection mr. jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo welcome John hey brand
it's good to uh it's good to be here it
feels like familiar surroundings yes yes
Jon and I both have a unhealthy
addiction to to technology and mobile
gadgets gadgets tree so for years now
we've been friends we've we've been
talking about this stuff we obsess about
this stuff probably to an extent that
isn't normal would you say John I davish
blame our wives get bunk beds as to that
as well it's just not healthy yeah yeah
I got a when's the last time that okay
so back in the day um I could take a
phone home to my girlfriend at the time
who I now I'm married to and she would
be impressed by a phone but as time went
on and his phone's got more and more
similar that really doesn't happen
anymore what was the last phone that you
could impress your wife with man I the
last phone that my life is ever
impressed with this is gonna be sad was
the blackberry pearl I brought it home
to her in red and you couldn't believe
it after that just been all downhill she
just she's appeared like such any
difference now I'm like look HTC One
she's like mad like look galaxy s4 yeah
and and you gotta like you gotta sell
you gotta sell it to them like listen
listen to this video it's got boomsound
it's it's louder isn't it yeah I think
it understand it quad course why do I
need that I found my something like you
don't but quad cores you know relieve
the international s40 like coors my
bloating if you had if you have it in
red then the response would be totally
different i think i think that's the
thing i got to get into red she was
blown away earlier I got her a pink
razor I mean years ago the original
raiser in pink and she was shocked at
that too so maybe just a color she just
need something like
new and flavorful flavorful every phone
is silver and black and and pretty much
the same white all over them they don't
feel dumb looking at her right now what
what phones you do you have around you
right now all right so what I'm staring
at right now um galaxy s4 for sprint
white ah HTC HTC One a cream cool ah
about the first sitting here see I've
got the International octo-core galaxy
s4 enakku box uh LG optimus g pro oh
well if you got here Galaxy Nexus I
believe this one's running um I know
what they don't this is hack I think
it's running new not Mozilla OS well my
they get my blinked I've I Firefox OS
did no no not firefox lightest ubuntu
that's the one that's a droid razr maxx
droid razr maxx and evo 4g LTE all rise
my stash sit on my desk gotta you've
gotta help of dutch / there by the way
everyone if you are having audio
problems or video problems we're doing
the best we can sometimes these Google
Hangouts just don't have the best
fidelity but hopefully it will clear up
so you had the you of the octa-core
galaxy s4 have you used that or is it
still in the box yet none of use it over
here somewhere look looks identical um
so honestly it's not it is often
quarters but it's two separate quad core
chips it's a 1.9 I think in a 1.2 and we
ran a quadrant score on it the quadrant
score was like a thousand higher than
the carrier s4 so it's not that much
faster I think it only kicks up of
course you really need it haven't found
anything that actually uses octa-core
see ya yeah and i think that's a common
misconception is that the galaxy s4
orthotic or actually uses eight cores at
the same time but it's either one set of
four cores or the other right yeah and
i'm guessing it probably uses the lower
clocks we
of course most of the time to conserve
battery lights you let's tie to probably
be getting a slower performance you
would on just a straight up you know
quad-core chip but you don't get the
primary to say I've got eight cores in
my phone before you got sucker it's more
than more than most people's desktop but
it's oh wait wait devices you have on
your desk right now and you guys guys
I've got a clean desk here I've only got
the HTC One you're making me feel sloppy
well you know sometimes you just got to
tuck them away um I'm really fascinated
that you're over life to which I'm just
got a tougher more yeah that's it that's
going to have to be another show so I
want to know what phone you're using
right now i am using as my daily driver
i just finished to review today we just
don't want to go up tomorrow of the
galaxy s4 i have switched back to the
HTC one she's back which is which is my
baby right now i love i love me some HTC
one x what is it about the HTC One so I
the big deal a thing from you the s4 I
think they're both great phones I think
you go with the s4 if you want a
removable battery you want expandable
storage I think those are two compelling
reasons to pay ps4 over the one um
whenever I whenever I travel I carry an
external battery charger with me so you
know with those little power batteries I
don't need an extra battery I don't care
and this has 32 gigs of storage so
that's funny not not yeah not a giant
issue for me I love to build quality of
it I like picking it up in the morning
and it's cold like that cold metal deal
is awesome i just i look like the way
the film fuels and honestly for me I
like kind of rooting for underdog a
little bit HTC it's no secret has
probably their whole company riding on
this phone oh yeah and I kind of dig
that imagine then that's really on a
dance I think it's kind of cool so you
know for my money I'd go if I decided to
your contract signing on HTC One yeah
yeah me too and it seems like every
other reviewer everyone that has an
opinion thinks the same thing do you
think Samsung played it too safe yeah so
I mean it's the big question for that is
even though all reviewers think the same
thing by how many how many times you
think galaxy s4 is gonna outsell the
1321 probably four to one ton
um so yeah I think it just comes out
like crazy um yeah I think that same
time totally played same I think they
went the apple route just sort of really
mine ain't broke don't fix it we can't
call it the galaxy s3s so just call it
for um I do think they call it the s4
with actually the number 4 into the room
and remotes I think they thought people
were too stupid to realize what 1v men
that's true but also I mean if you know
once we get to the 6 and the 7 i mean
the the VIII and the VIII i actually
they got to stop that crap no that's
that's true um i don't think i'm
noticing about the s4 and a few field on
yours too buzz if you like there's like
a lurid grease on the back like it's
like slimy kinda the hyper glaze thing
it's it's a it's a marketing point but i
don't think i think give the tracks from
you know the experience it's so slimy
and slippery yeah a tip 3 i've had
something on my hands like I don't know
why cuz like something on my hands call
how do you feel about the durability of
the HTC One have you have you dropped it
yet have you been rough with it I i have
i have dropped it and drop them from
pretty lehigh distance onto concrete
when i picked it up and honest guy
couldn't find a contact point i couldn't
even see where it was scratched and
damaged wow so it's gonna be really
durable I will say though HTC swapped
out our units actually a few times at
first 18teen if they said that the home
button was totally flush with the top of
it you couldn't feel where it was yeah
um and I just walked it out a couple
days ago because the simulator is
operating so that's so strange and I
think they're having some production
issues because um I just got this AT&amp;amp;T
version for personal use i actually
bought at full price because i love it
that much and I've got little tiny gaps
in certain spots it's not a design thing
because it's inconsistent all around the
device and I've seen some people on
YouTube complaining about this but I
there there are some issues the power
button is interesting because we got the
international version it was completely
flush and I thought that that was just
kind of part of the design but then the
AT&amp;amp;T version came in and it yeah it's up
a little bit yes I'm not supposed to be
flush at all in fact that you who have
accessed all the phones
went out and purchased a divisive full
price there are money I think says a lot
about the phone because in the reality
is we don't do that all that often yeah
yeah that's that's very true um speaking
is we're talking about durability on the
international version I don't know how
it happened and it really makes me
worried but I got a dent in the back
like a little hammer look I don't know I
don't know I did I it's like a little
dimple it looks like um it looks like
you know someone kind of took their
knuckle and smashed it in and it's it
shouldn't do that you know no did you
hold smash it you know I'm image smash
whenever things don't go my way I do a
Hulk smash so it's possible that the one
was in the way one day if something
doesn't like if you're trying to launch
a website and it crashes couple seconds
later pog smash hug smashed screen what
do you think about the camera and and I
should I ask about that in two ways what
do think about the quality and what do
you think about it only being four
megapix was that enough or is that not
working for you so the quality i think
has been has been really awesome
actually we did a full comparisons the
camera quality versus everything yes
four versus the Lumia versus the iphone
5 and I think he eats you see what
really helped so I think it's a
misconception to say that it's only 4
megapixels it's four separate sensor
stacked on top of each other as opposed
to 14 megapixel sensor so I think the
qualities been awesome where I think you
lose out is we need to use digital do I
think that's where you see the lack of
megapixel edge so to speak with your
doctor being a digital zoom it's
incredible in low-light pictures look
ridiculously good video quality is I
mean they're all the same to be
diplomatic um but I think it's been a
great phone I think people get really
caught up with my own like it's only 4
megapixels that sucks I didn't realize
that it's it's actually different
megapixel layout than other phones it's
at the low light performance it's just
uh it's it's like night vision I think
it's ridiculous right yeah it's really
cool they've done an incredible job of
it may be learned from each iteration
their phone so that each one got better
and better absolutely what do you think
about sense are you liking it more than
stock Android or do you stop
clean light minimal I still prefer
cleaning Android but not by much anymore
I like the new sense it's less heavy I
don't use I know both our sites rumblin
food but um I mean maybe I'm fighting
myself you know yes of the foot here but
don't you believe you all that much I
don't I tell you immediately I mean it's
for a certain kind of person I think and
that's and that's great and for them
it's for the people that you know don't
know Flipboard exist and they're like oh
look at this thing it's kind of pretty I
can get all my news right here yeah it's
I mean I've got it you know a couple
home screens to the left and I've got
texture than ever I very rarely look at
it um but I like the new sense i think
that HD got the hell out of their own
way with it which is nice as opposed to
sense for which was crazy and the big
bad keyboard i was on the original HTC
One X oh yeah but I launched with the
arrows and it was awful I think they
really have come a long way I think the
combination this phone is the device I
build quality rivals rivals Apple that's
uh that's saying something right there
dude same can be tremendously me HTC's
come so far I remember before i started
doing tech reviews i was watching your
videos and you were reviewing the jazz
jam and the JAF jar by i'm a you know I
me I might through their name on all the
HTC product that's fun to see them to
come from there to here obviously I
remember watching your videos you've had
like a wire rack or something in the
background like filing stuff oh yeah Jon
and I used to watch each other's videos
back in the day this is probably 2,000
what eight does before before I started
making videos and I started Mike to die
at 2007's almost even good earlier than
that and it's just it's just fun to go
back and look at our amateurish setups
and our through you know 240p 320p
videos and I i actually did on pocket
now a review of the blackberry
blackberry was it oh yeah everywhere
which Blackbird it was but I I did it
for pocket now take before technobuffalo
was even even a thing yeah
do you ever go back and look at it
looked some of these older things that
that you review like yeah bones that
were so thick and you would take it out
of the box and be like wow this is real
thin man this is the thinnest i've ever
scheme and it was like 20 millimeters i
get nostalgic whenever we hit like big
milestones i go back and look I'm it's
funny you mention i remember the
remember the tilt the tilt to that ed
came out yeah i think it's kind of the
joy of course so I mean that was
incredible i remember you and I talking
like I couldn't believe it like screen
went up and down like I was it was touch
and it was running windows on it I mean
you obviously loved windows mobile well
when Hannibal that's all there was back
then I mean you could let well there was
palm in blackberry but you know windows
mobile was the only real smart operating
system in my who loves windows mobile oh
you loved windows mobile more than
anybody's loved any operating system
that give you credit for it you stuck
with it you know through the bad windows
mobile times and now into the light ages
of Windows Phone but look at that phone
be like man it was huge even the
original g1 really I was crazy ash
keyboard um but yeah I look back in a
whole video and it's like I can't be
people actually watched us it the
Internet has come a long way and you
know back then um you know things were
different hard today there it was a
different time it's crazy in this
industry because like six months is like
a decade you know in normal world you
know you go from in six months you go
from single core dual core 2 quad core
two octa-core you know whatever 1604
it's going to be it's it's crazy to see
the evolution things change so fast and
it's actually consumer I think it's hard
to pick a phone that you just want to be
new for like a week yeah yeah you just
you don't want it to be obsolete very
quickly speaking of 16 core processors
do you think that we're approaching that
time that we've all been talking about
wear specs really don't matter anymore
because Android for example is just fast
enough and then we're going to see
innovation somewhere else yeah I think
for most users like the average folks
like you know not not the ones who root
you're kinda crazy stuff like bleep you
I think for the average phone you sure
yeah absolutely not there's any
difference you can pick me up a dual
core or quad core phone I don't think at
all now that being said there's always
sort of those leadies there is the other
folks are at the end of the bell curve
they're gonna be the early adopters for
all these new faster phones and there
might be a reason why you need faster
phones you know maybe hearing
fingerprint scanners maybe some sort of
augmented reality and take advantage of
a faster processors I think the
technology just doesn't need the
processor speed yet but not the same
won't you know in the future yeah and I
think that's like the most important
thing and it's hard for us to sit here
today and and talk about what a you know
a 16 core processor on a phone could
possibly do because we don't have
applications that even need quad core
today quad cores just let it fun
necessity you know what let's do it
again in like three years we're gonna
kind of myself Oh watch this video and
being like what idiots man they not know
that 16 cores is necessary for
holographic displays you know what's
going to happen because we've been on
video before in the past saying like
this iphone resolution this you know the
the retina resolution you'll ever need
anything better than that it can't get
any better than that and then you have
the HTC One which is like looking
through a window and it's it's
unbelievably it looks like there's a
sticker on the display like giving your
first taken out of box and I mean they
look like like real screens I always
look back at like the original iphone
screen and like it looks good to me at
the time and I look at it now or the
original iPad screams like you speaking
of iPads what what's your tablet of
choice these days tablet of choices I've
had many i prefer android for my phone
for me though there's nothing better on
a tablet than iOS you know we agree on a
lot of things but that's one place we
disagree and you wrote this nice article
several months ago about why you were
making the ipad mini of your new daily
driver and it's yeah pushed aside the
ipad 4 and you said that the portability
was enough to overlook the shortcomings
of the low quality display or not low
quality but you know not requisite and
it
you're standing by that that's
interesting I've still I tried switching
back to the ipad 4 and it just it felt
too big to me I really like that screen
size I don't know I I don't know why I
can't quantify it i mean the regular
size ipad is not you know so giant you
can't carry it with you I just I really
like that 7 inch screen size I didn't
think I was going to um yeah I've got a
nexus 7 here that I like as well but if
I'm traveling or picked up a tablet it's
nine out of ten times invidi ipad mini
about you you know my tablet usage has
been down since I got the one you ever
see that happening where like you
usually go home and you check your email
on your iPad but you get a new phone in
so you're doing it on your phone and
your reading on your phone all the time
i use the ipad in more things like I'll
get up and I'll check my email i'll go
throw out to forget out of bed and at
night I want you to be with my wife and
like sometimes what manage my fantasy
sports team but it's really the extent
of my tableting right now is your is
your tablet usage down over time yeah it
seems like it is going down over time um
but I mean especially when you get phone
to get bigger and bigger like I mean
imagine a galaxy mega already got a six
inch boner it's an inch smaller than
your template what do you think about
the phablet saying the things they it
was literally getting bigger bigger tips
take a like an iPad at your pocket
phablets are remarkably popular because
they work for a lot of people but they
don't work for me because my hands are
small and i really like I ergonomics you
know what I mean yeah no that's fair
enough um I really like the galaxy the
Galaxy Note series are like the real big
Samsung devices that I can look past
some of the TouchWiz failings and maybe
differ on the note B when it gets all
the new you know s4 asked features right
um I think it's like this it's a novelty
like it's like this there any but this
is my phone and it's like oh that's my
head and people look at me like I'm
crazy it's huge and I have you know I
got relatively decent sized hands so
it's it's not like a organ I guess you I
just it's like an ology it's a it's a
big phone how long you review the note 2
how long did you use it as your daily
driver before saying this is a little
too much I'm gonna go back to
my smaller phone dude I would have still
I would have still uses my daily driver
before the HTC one came but it seemed to
have a habit of it the same breeder
broke in our heart do you do you like
what do you do with those some readers
is I think so i use a adapter for nano
SIM to micro sim I think I just like
tearing them up yeah I've got I've got
some of those have you ever tried
cutting a micro sim to a nano-sim I do I
have the cutter um and then I you
actually use the shell afterward doesn't
adapter if you want but that never that
breaks into right you can slide it back
in its time because you need it for the
iphone and freakin apples on what uses
that silly nanos entered are at least 11
z is that silly nano standard yeah no
one's really picked up on that speaking
of apple let's talk a little bit about
apple we're gonna talk for another 10 or
15 minutes i just i definitely want to
get apple into the mix food sounds like
you're not picking up your iphone 5
lately no you know while i was waiting
for my HTC want to get fixed i used the
iphone for a couple of days um and like
I again what people say about you know
loving iOS like it's very functional and
it works you to check email you to play
games need to browse the web to watch
video social media it works and it works
very very well but I think for those of
us that are served in the industry are
really into the technology it works but
it just stale it's the same experience
since 2007 we even I can mend a lot put
a different launcher on my android boom
yeah we should want something different
to be exciting that Apple used to have I
mean I don't care if it's you know will
give your hurt faster has former
megapixels like mmm it's it's not it's
time for a leap and iOS 7's got to be
that leap what do you think Apple can do
with ios7 to make it compelling again
we're talking to this around the office
so I mean obviously I have no saying it
but saying is no great having discussion
I would be fine with Apple not releasing
an iphone 5s for another almost another
6-8 months another year the iPhone 5 is
so competitive with the current
generation flagship still competitive
with the s4 is so competitive
HTC one people are still gonna buy it
it's got apples logo on it if iOS 7
isn't ready is it going to blow the
world away with something new don't
release a minimal product over these two
5s that's got a fingerprint scanner in
iOS 6 or iOS 6 point whatever you want
to live inside they call it it's going
to hurt the brand more iOS 7 needs to
redo I think how users use the phone
keep widgets he improved notifications I
needed improve notification drop-down
could do something with the lock screens
that is giving me a camera button ya
mean so eat a quick way to view
information you can do it on Android do
it on windows so you've been doing on
blackberry 10 but you can't do it on iOS
and at some point saying we're the best
iOS because our application to the best
not going to get you so far it's it's
not enough and and what I learned from
from the HTC One is that something
that's very important that you don't get
a lot is the light like I'll give you
I'll give you one example on the HTC One
you can turn off the lock screen on most
android phones all android phones you
can turn off the lock screen but HTC
paid paid attention to that little
action and so when you unlock the lock
screen when you turn on your phone you
don't have a lock screen look what
happens a little animation it's a little
de mariage i did another most people
leave lock screens on but it's stuff
like that little delightful things that
make you go Oh some reveals a crap about
the lockscreen someone spent time to
make this like an awesome delightful
experience and and iOS is just not that
anymore it's it's got to be again and we
sit here and we try to hypothesize about
what they could possibly do and it's got
to be some big stuff yeah it's gotta be
I think see it's software is got to be
huge may be combined at with some new
hardware you know something crazy with
NFC wireless charging you know something
then it's already out there that Apple
can you know claim they invented you
know whatever call it like Apple Apple
tap is really just you know NFC tub ya
know or you know I
charge which is why I was charged I'm
een just something that's new I can get
people excited again about apple and I
think they're if they don't hit it out
of the park this next round it's going
to be a lot of trouble I agree what if
they did do an iphone 5s and it was you
know had a 12 megapixel camera and some
other stuff but it had a wireless
charging feature that could work across
the room would that be enough for you oh
I get the killer feature give it
something to get people excited about
give it a killer feature yeah if you
charge across the room Oh that'd be
crazy I mean I'd be worried about like
lightning what's gonna be no body uh
yeah you know but yeah it's something
crazy what do you think I don't know I
don't know I think I think we're going
to see a mega leaf one of these days of
battery tech and we're going to go from
like this one's once a day charging
thing to like even double that or triple
that and it's going to come from
processor technology it's going to come
from battery technology but for the last
10 15 years it's been the same bigger
batteries bigger batteries some
processor tech a little bit of processor
deck but it's been basically flat in
terms of how long your phone can go
without needing a charge very true
totally agree and and if one company can
do it because they control both the
hardware and the software it's Apple I
mean Samsung really I mean think of
reinvent Android so it uses less power
but they're not going to do that it's I
follow the electric car industry very
closely to set a personal interest and
the battery technology there we have now
is pretty common in cell phones laptops
even lithium-ion cells there's a new
technology coming called lithium fair
which it sounds fancy but it's a new
array of chemicals that supposedly can
increase battery life health and charged
by a factor of 10 whoa and coming i
would say in the 2016 like actually in a
product 2016 time frame which is pretty
awesome and if they can do it in cars
room they can be miniaturized you know
further the mobile industry so very very
soon i think we're going to see example
you mentioned it that's all is that tech
really
expensive right now super expensive they
did a first test that it works and you
can just check it out lithium-air if I
family company that's had tried it with
Tesla which does always seem to be on
the cutting edge of technology just
reveal the damn patents for some battery
air technology that they're claiming is
going to hit their cars in 2017 that
will be awesome and a little plug here
guys if you like cars you like tech
technobuffalo has this awesome new
series called driven where they put them
two together and they twist them around
and you get a cool video with cars and
tech so check that yeah check thanks man
check that out um so let me ask you some
industry white better some broad
questions what are you so far in 2013
it's only been four months what are you
what have you been most disappointed
about Apple mmm and in general and Apple
um I like the applet had a fight I like
the Apple that during a big trade show
would send out invites to a conference I
like the Apple when Steve Jobs would get
up there and say flash is dead you know
we don't need to be a fight to be
something exciting I miss that fight
that Apple had I just don't have any
more you can disagree with them all you
want uh but I i missed that discussion I
think we just haven't had anything you
know like they use to be no joke you go
to a trade show or go to Vicki no apples
in that an invite just there's been
there's been nothing what if what if
they're I think maybe the whole industry
is doing this as a whole they're
changing the release cycles to be a
little bit slower what if every two
years they have a bone like a big fiery
product that's awesome is that okay or
do you want it to be back again a
one-year increments nah and whatever
they feel that products are ready for
fine but I just missed the vitriol
between you know CEO is going back and
forth you know the eric schmidt and
Steve Jobs saying I'm gonna go nuclear
on google and it's that kind of stuff
like the head of a company that is just
passionate you can see that passion you
just don't see that Tim Cook like very
slow Southern drawl you know what it
talks about iOS I just I don't feel that
excitement anymore about apple on just
on this point I got my start reviewing
Apple devices and uh yeah thanks
do you think that I think I think one of
the coolest things about apples that
they they do risky things they create
segments that might be a total failure
but they do it really well so it's a
success do you think this i watch thing
will happen and if so do you think that
it's going to ipad if I the watch
industry um that's a good question and
the what you're saying like by I
catified with Apple has been really good
at finding industry that nobody knew
existed or no one even knew they needed
it may can get something that you have
to have um nst you know we said this to
print this about tablets like I didn't
stray see the need for a tablet until I
had a tablet but now I get it I don't
see the need for an iWatch yet I don't
see what it could do that I couldn't do
on my phone I don't need a second screen
type system you know for my phone on my
watch um I think thank you buddy can
pull it off though I think it would be
Apple um you know maybe there's that
cool thing that we didn't know you could
do you know with your with your from
watch then I'm kind of excited to see
what it is I do think they'll edevalla
program products i watch something we'll
see absolutely and and that's awesome
that you think that's going to happen I
think that any time this happens where
some guy who knows something says
something the effective if they make a
product I have no idea how I would use
it I don't think I need it anytime that
happens it's a mega opportunity for a
company to show you how you can use it
and make you want one and millions of
other people want one totally agree it
makes you think of Google glass which
coincidentally what would you think of
google glass that's an interesting topic
of conversation so far I'm not very
excited about it I you know I I think
it's so far from there's so many people
that really believe in it like it's
going to transform society and we're
thinking about it right here 2013 it's
very early in 10 years is everyone gonna
have glass on I think know what do you
think I think it's deal I needs only
gonna go one of two ways i an't either
going to be did it everyone's gonna
catch on chinko you everything earthen
you like the segue it's just gonna say
the segway reviews that's so funny I
mean we were supposed to all be driving
to work
segways by now right yeah it's gonna be
one of those two um I don't know I'm
excited to use glass I'm excited to try
it I it's good at I give Google credit
for developing in the open and I wish
where companies would do that saying
okay we have an idea for a product
here's what it is if you want to help us
try it part of the movement we'd love it
if it works then great but doesn't the
work like the Nexus Q that ok least we
tried excellent here's what we're doing
here's our skunk works like let's let's
develop in the open and that's really
cool at Google assuming they don't get
enough credit for it if you are a
betting man what would you say would be
bigger in five years smart watches or
wearable class like computing things
glass like computing things why do you
say that because I always seem in movies
is your movies um it just seems like
people always want to way to like avoid
talking to people and it seemed like you
could still look at somebody and pretend
like you thought you doing but still be
you know watching your video again
Carter your eyes oh my god you could be
out there with your wife and you're
watching the game it's not gonna be
pretty well I mean Sean I wasn't near
you now I go even Google glass there you
go but no baby I'm doing work I mean the
first thing that gets busy google glass
you know it's going to be adult themed
content make it more real let's not talk
about through we've got young people
watching so we're gonna finish things up
here with one or two more questions what
are you most excited about for the rest
of this year i am from technology wise
um I'm excited for iOS 7 which I still
hope we're going to get a chance to see
and I am excited and I'm gonna put he's
a 2 thing on to kind of get three okay
all right galaxynote3 because i love
those giant screens and I'm excited to
see if HTC makes a phablet that they do
I will be over do you think HTC's gonna
make a tablet that's gonna look like the
one with a nice aluminum thin all that
boom sound and everything do I hope so
if they make like it
five and a half inch HTC one called the
two or whatever they want to call it I
would use that so fast and be so excited
about it so I want to see if they do
that but I think for the note 3 is
probably one that will actually see note
3 is going to be awesome what do you
think HTC would do first a phablet or a
tablet based on the success that they're
going to have with the phone a phablet
for sure they've tried tablet that's
like a crowded market and it's still
still still not mature enough at I
haven't checked android tablet apps in a
couple of months are they getting better
he still has crappy is oh yeah no
they're still there definitely getting
better for pursuer are improving but the
tablet world is just so crowded there so
many options I remember they released
the jet stream and it was like nine
hundred dollars even on contract yet
stream was terrible I would yeah it's
it's so silly i would say phablet for
sure hope you heard it here first
although it seems like a reasonable
train of thought that they would do a
phablet because it's it's more
competitive and they could probably win
their if they do a bigger screen one
thing right yeah totally agree i think i
think they're seeing sort of little
cracks in samsung's arm and i'm gonna
try and hammer at home and i hope they
come out with the crazy aggressive
marketing campaign like like samsung did
with apple I hope HTC does the same for
samsung HTC really needs to the
marketing and my brother emailed me the
other day he reads the Wall Street
Journal the paper version I didn't know
they still make it and there was an
eight page full page ad for the galaxy
s4 like in other words for page turns of
galaxy s4 that's crazy I saw you tweet
about that this morning that's insane
first of all I don't know anybody still
read this one newspaper so good for your
brother um but that that's that's
incredible that's incredible ad buy
that's what HTC needs to do why aren't
they doing it I wish I do man you know I
say I wish I wish I know remember
remember the HTC you campaigned yes oh
yeah
why don't they bring that back do
something I there quietly brilliant was
great but you know no one wants to talk
to the quiet guy in the corner be the
loud guy screaming about how awesome
your product is yeah and early
indications I don't know if they still
have it but on their website they had a
slogan the HTC One yeah it still
everything your phone isn't that sounds
kind of Windows Phone ish you know the
key on the beta test well that's got
about and it's got to be it's got to be
awesome and had it Angry has to be well
we it sounds like we both agree that HTC
did something awesome this year we're
gonna end this episode of VIP is there
