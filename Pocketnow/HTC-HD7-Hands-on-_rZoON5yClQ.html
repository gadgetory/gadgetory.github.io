pocketnow.com we are looking at the HTC
hd7 possibly the most beautiful windows
phone 7 device released yet this is
going on t-mobile and it's 199 on sale
in November most likely yeah for sure
that we don't know for sure yet and it
is a beautiful device it as a 4.3 inch
display of course it's capacitive and we
have these three capacitive touch
buttons down on the bottom and
surrounded in a ring of chrome which is
quite nice a speaker is kind of a
beautiful two millimeters high here it's
kind of a different design from what HTC
normally does and below where the
microphone is down here we're actually
it's probably just a design element
stereo speaker stereo speaker oh that's
right stereo speaker here and here and
then of course the microphone is down
there moving around the back it says hd7
here in full full glory over the brush
metal background kind of a rubbery touch
material on the back and then here we
have the 5 megapixel camera with the
dual LED flash of course we have this
extent here which is very functional
provides a good amount of weight
although Adam and I are a little bit
concerned about how along this will hold
up outdoor all the hinges it feels a
little bit flimsy it's kind of a plastic
immersive I'm sure HTC has tested it
many times dang off the back battery
cover have the battery not sure what the
size of town taking it out sim card of
course no removable storage but you get
16 gigabytes of storage on the hd7 just
quite quite fit I'll get it next to the
HTC hd2 which is presumably the
predecessor to the hd7 we made the jump
from HD to 200 HD 2 2 HD 7 so very
similar-looking devices at first glance
but of course HD 7 is adorned a little
bit more nicely in chrome have different
designs and obviously the hardware
buttons seem to be out of style now
going from capacity by on the back here
not many similarities both have the dual
LED flash and you won't find any
markings of HTC Sense or because the hd7
doesn't really have HTC Sense otherwise
you're going to see in a second it does
have a feature that HTC has added so
here we have the device screen is very
well you can wheel it on your eye looks
great and slide to unlock here 4.3 inch
screen looks fantastic it is a high
level of responsiveness in fact just as
much responsiveness as the Samsung Focus
which has the 4 inch AMOLED screen
extremely smooth and we have some HTC
stuff here called the HTC hub but it's
not that deep deeply integrated in the
phone but it adds a little bit of HTC
flavor to device and it looks just like
we saw in the weeks actually so we can
add a variety of different kind of
features to this so we can click get
more and that should launch us into the
choices so we can do stocks sound
enhancer and let's get more it's going
to jump us into sort of a little half
rotation download areas we can get the
notes application and again this is the
stuff that we saw react it's all very
much consistent with what we've seen
before we can't download that up a
minute at the moment back up a little
bit see the other things that you can
add to the HTC hub so if that can /
photo very basic things I mean HTC
really hasn't done that much to make
this a better experience it's basically
an install of Windows Phone 7 with a
little bit of HTC magic so let's go
through the web browsing experience more
do a comparison with the HTC hd2 just so
you can get a sense for what do they
look like it's possible that we're not
going to get any data here see what
happens as it for that all parents under
somebody's
I'm typing for a weird angle but the
keyboard is quite nice because you get
the large keys see if it actually loads
which one else would
screen rotation pretty fast just as fast
as we've seen with the LG Panther
development device I mean it's quite
good as well it looks like we are
getting that was weird that was weird it
went to take it see about it okay let me
try to type that again because it went
to a non kid from the website there and
i'll get i'll get it loaded on the other
and we'll come back and compare this
especially so wrong so here we have
Kakinada calm loaded on both the hd7 and
the hd2 that we're using opera mobile
29.7 and i play cloud or 59.1 is so
scrolling is super buttery soon with all
windows phone 7 obviously there's no
html5 or flash support although oddly
it's doing a better job at displaying
certain range elements that is nice too
so we'll do a little screen rotation
speed test here which is always a little
bit of a challenge sure windows phone 7
1 HD 2 1 HD 7 1 okay and we'll see what
it's like to pinch and zoom on the
ground on the page from a relative so
usually pretty good on the hd2 although
sometimes it gets a little bit choppy
but I think you'll find in Windows Phone
7 the experience is just really really
refined are your droid and other than
that we jump back to the start screen
here it is standard fare and that's what
you expect from windows phone 7
but the the large screen on the hd7
really makes it a better experience
don't feel better mobile TV let's check
that out no I'm sorry looks like you
have to download something for the
marketplace we can't do they're totally
our video tour that's good let's see
some video on this music extender
controlled my favorite dollars out of a
house where your mom lives are pretty
good it's a tmobile island service the
Harriers are adding their own little of
touches along going and that is the HTC
hd7 a worthy successor to the ocean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
