new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a second look at the
biggest Windows Phone Nokia's ever made
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the lumia 1520 and this is episode 37
of after the buzz our demo device comes
to us from our friends at GSM nation if
you've got a hankering for the biggest
baddest Windows Phone on the market do
what we did visit GSM nation.com and
tell'em pocket now sent you Windows
Phone has never been the bastion of the
spec obsessed but some people want
maximum Hardware no matter what eight
months after launch the Lumia 1520 is
still Microsoft's handheld spec leader
with a snapdragon 800 2 gigs of ram and
microSD expansion all powered by a
monster battery and despite the
onslaught of oversized smartphones
hitting shelves in the past year the
1520 is still freakishly huge with its 6
inch display the good news at 1080p
resolution that display continues to
hold up well even given our modern
dubious flirtation with quad HD screens
the bad news at 206 grams at 162
millimeters in height the Lumia 1520 is
still definitely a two-handed phone for
anyone outside the NBA that is and for
all windows phones enhancements with
version 8.1 it still doesn't offer much
to take advantage of that big canvas
like the snap multitasking in its
desktop cousin the sum of eight point
one's offerings actually make the 15:20
harder to use like the Notification
Center way up at the
but the display the platform still has
catching up to do in functionality
compared to Android and iOS and the road
to 8.1 hasn't been without a few bumps
we see intermittent keyboard lag and
occasional instability with the new
windows build which wasn't there before
fortunately those are not major hiccups
they don't come around that often and
they're likely to be smoothed out with
software updates over time further the
new platforms many improvements like
Cortana combined with a richer app
ecosystem to make the 15:20 a much more
capable device than it was back in
November the Snapdragon 800 offers more
than enough power for intense browsing
and high demand gaming and the big
screen still out does any other in the
Microsoft catalogue for long books or
Netflix sessions while the speaker
around back makes up for its rear
placement with a very loud voice with
optical image stabilization Carl Zeiss
optics and a 20 megapixel PureView
sensor the Lumia 1520's camera was
nearly without peer when it debuted and
that remains true today while Sony has
done a lot to advance the Android
photography frontier with the cameras on
its newer Xperia Z and Apple continues
to deliver a phenomenal photographic
experience with the iPhone neither
offers the simple yet fine grain control
the Lumia does and that's a software
experience Microsoft continues to build
on the video tuner app is brand new and
it was released just as this report was
going to press from bright Sun to
moonlight the Lumia 1520 camera brings
the heat
the 1520 is still awkward to use as a
phone awkward to fit into a pocket and
awkward to explain to people who think
you're carrying a tablet around town if
that doesn't sound like your cup of
raktajino you can find most of the
1520's capabilities in the more
pocketable arguably more modern looking
Lumia icon and lumia 930 but neither of
those packs the extreme endurance of the
1520's huge battery and neither offers
the kind of screen acreage that could
conceivably replace a tablet even eight
months after launch the 1520's powerful
internals keep it at the forefront of
the Windows Phone landscape it's one of
the most future-proof Microsoft
smartphones we've seen yet despite its
status as a niche product for a smaller
audience full of people who prefer
sizeable smartphones for more Windows
