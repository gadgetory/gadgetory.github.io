spotted in the wild that it looks huge
that's what she said a leaked video of
the Google pixel 3 light emerge earlier
today and was quickly deleted and it
looks like the long waited I've had many
five is coming in the first half of 2019
I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and the face you
see is jet lag in addition to the fact
that have crossed a couple of countries
right now but the here the news
this is pocket out daily sponsored by
swap up the official news today begin
with a event invites as Sony has just
sent out press events for something to
happen at MWC but well it's Mobile World
Congress last year we've got the xperia
x III i promise you that review is
coming this weekend we got a delay what
do you expect but yeah now we're getting
the eggsy for i assume i pursue me here
specs Qualcomm Snapdragon a 55 in
addition to the usual suspects we'll
keep you posted on what we get at the
end now let's talk about LG as well we
already know that we should expect a g8
from WC and that's all fine but we hear
that that's not the whole story if you
remember the whole LG g5 and the
modularity of friends it seems that the
company wants to try it again but this
time differently there might be this
sort of like folio case that you attach
to the g8 it brings a secondary display
to add some tablet functionality so that
it can be a phone when you want it and
it can be a tablet when you want it I
find out to be a genius idea when
compared to having a foldable product
all the time but we'll see what we get
now let's talk about iPad Mini 5 as
we've got reports on digit times that we
should be expecting to new iPads at
March the iPad Mini 5 and we've already
seen leaks of its design and the iPad of
nine point seven that's now gonna grow
up to the iPad 10 inch I guess if we
could call it that way less bezels I
presume we're not exactly sure what
these tablets are going to bring that's
different but hopefully they are pro
tablets and not just chumps
now let's talk about the Google pixel
three light as it currently emerged in a
video on YouTube it was quickly pulled
it's out there somewhere we know but it
pretty much shows the phone in the wild
it shows the box and the
fact that it's a device that's actually
coming we again don't know how this
phone is going to stack up to the
current pixels but we're hoping it
stacks up well we'll keep you posted on
that as well and finally the hot news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 plus it was apparently spotted in
the wild of running one UI and obviously
a larger than average cutout punch hole
or whatever you want to call it we have
heard that this one might bring dual
cameras we're not exactly sure if that's
going to be the case but probably the
most interesting part is we've already
got case makers saying that the qualcomm
ultrasonic technology for that
fingerprint scanner is not working with
their screen protectors apparently they
already have a unit and they can't get
it to work so that's gonna be rather
interesting listen in the comments down
below two things I mean how often do use
a screen protector I've seen a ton of
people using them on galaxies and number
two I mean what do you think about the
leaks as it looks nice to you ugly I
obviously prefer to see the finished
product but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion and
friends before we end this video we
would love to thank swapper for
sponsoring our content today it is time
to sell those pieces of tech you're not
using anymore swappable let's use cell
phones tablets laptops and now even
cameras and games so you can get some
money in your pocket
