over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's have a look at a device after a
few months after release and when it's
not shiny and new anymore I'm happy that
I'm with pocket now this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note edge and this is episode 42
of after the buzz brought to you by out
how about the two phones that I carry
every day one is usually a phablet and
those of you that follow me know that
I've drifted to the Galaxy Note lineup
for the last three generations tablets
are the most uncomfortable phones to
carry around so if you're gonna put up
with the added size and heft
I've always felt that there should be an
added value behind that and Samsung is
still the only company that not only
created the category but it's also
giving you more for your money when it
comes to the Edit screen real estate and
when choosing between the note 4 and the
note edge all right clearly decided to
give in to Samsung's experimentation one
more time
now let's face it folks
you don't really buy a Galaxy Note
because you want to carry a bigger phone
around since there are a ton of other
phablet options in the market that will
cost you a lot less and this statement
is pretty much true even more with the
Galaxy Note edge if you're willing to
put down 400 dollars with a two-year
contract for this particular AT&amp;amp;T unit
you expect to get more for your money
and after using this device for almost a
month let's just say that I almost feel
happy see on the positive front this
phone is definitely a head-turner
it's always cool to be that guy in the
store with a phone that people have
never seen and want to hold and the
combination of this beautiful quad HD
Super AMOLED display match with the edge
are definitely things that scream look
at me from a distance the edge isn't
just about giving you a curved Android
experience because that would completely
defeat the purpose in a way we could say
that this is a display in itself
designed to enhance your multitask
capabilities and so far it's proven to
be quite useful for me I love being able
to have my favorite shortcuts available
to me from any screen and saving me the
need to move to the home screen every
now and then and you can enhance the
edge with a quick tool spar sports
scores calendar appointments and many
other services of your choosing and it's
even cooler that the edge adapts to
almost every application you use like
for example using the s-pen or playing
music as well now obviously not
everything is perfect then in the case
of the edge I have my fair share of
photos that I didn't really want to take
it's really hard for you to hold the
phone and not touch the edge on
deliberately so I would suggest that you
watch Michael Fischer's full video of
everything the edge can do mainly
because the list is extremely long and
after the buzz is mainly about judging a
phone for how its aged and in that sense
it's great to say that all my negative
experiences with the node edge are
actually based on that for starters we
really don't understand why Sampson gave
the Galaxy Note 4 fancy or sham furred
edges and hardware keys when compared to
the Galaxy Note edge
but even worse is the fact that these
champers look terrible after a few
months of use this phone has been used
by Michael Fisher and Adam Dowd before
it was sent to me so it's not like if
it's been sitting in a drawer since we
unboxed it now a cool thing is that
Samsung did choose to keep the natural
aluminum color in these champers so if
you've got a 1500 grit the sheet of
sandpaper handy
I suggest you polish it with care and
not too often since you're literally
stripping aluminum away from the surface
every time you do but this is really a
cool way to make the phone look like new
again at least in the chamfers now if
you're watching this video to help you
decide if you want to buy a Galaxy Note
edge I highly suggest you choose the
white variant
since smudges are very apparent on the
faux leather back the display and even
the scratches on the HOME key are hard
to hide on this black unit here the
software would be the second example of
aging done wrong I'll spare you my
complaints about TouchWiz and so you
really can enjoy the benefits of a
Galaxy Note edge without it Samson did
its fair share of customizations in
order to help you take advantage of the
edge and even though most of these are
very welcome they all come at the
expense of very slow software updates
the Note edge is still running Android
4.4.4 kitkat at a time when it's
fraternal twin the note 4 is already
running lollipop and while many of you
might not find this to be a deal-breaker
the problem is that this phone in
particular is really desperate for a
software update Michael didn't have many
software complaints in his review but
months of use have clearly made this
phone slow and buggy this doesn't happen
all the time up to the point where I
really haven't been able to replicate
what slows this phone down to a crawl
but whatever it does I didn't been
forced to remove the battery and restart
the device other things like the camera
can take forever to launch almost every
single time from the lockscreen and
using the fingerprint scanner is hit or
miss all the time
the edges another thing that hasn't
really aged well since not much has been
added to the Galaxy store since we
reviewed it last fall now to be fair not
everything is bad and the highest point
for me when it comes to this phone is
its camera my experience with cameras on
Android phones has always been terrible
but my god
Samsung 16 megapixel shooter is hands
down one of the best smartphone cameras
that I've ever used the company still
bundles a couple of shooting modes but
trust me you really won't need them the
cameras auto mode is not only smart but
very quick to adapt to even the toughest
lighting conditions for example you can
focus directly at the Sun and the
software will immediately detect it
alert you of its presence and adapt a
shot accordingly I could do without the
aggressiveness of the focus but the
resulting photos beat the pants off
every smartphone camera that I've ever
used even the Lumia 930 for example
you've got great color saturation great
detail and amazing low-light performance
as well I also love how the camera can
slowly refocus while shooting a video
mimicking a real camera and not bringing
that jerkiness that's very common with
smartphone cameras and the rest of my
overall experience this is a Galaxy Note
in every way good battery life that will
last you through a day of heavy use
great data speeds with support for more
antennas than the average smartphone and
a decent phone call experienced through
the earpiece as well the speaker did
improve suspension when compared to the
old note 3 but placing it at the back
again wasn't really the smartest move
oddly even with the eventual software
stutters in the UI you really won't be
disappointed with using this phone for
gaming the vice handles every single
game I threw it with ease and the
leopard that I perceive heating from the
Snapdragon 805 powering it
and yes you do have an S Pen here guys
but I found it to be the exact same
experience as the old note 3 just with
the added benefits of the edge which is
not really saying much this continues to
be something nice to have but you
probably won't use it much and that
statement pretty much narrows it down
for the Samsung Galaxy Note edge after
the buzz this is the ultimate Samsung
smartphone that packs absolutely
everything the company's R&amp;amp;D department
could throw at many of these features
are definitely nice to have but the fact
of the matter is you probably won't use
them much still you don't buy this phone
to fit in this is a phone for geeks like
me looking to stand out from the crowd
and if that's your thing then this is
the phone for you once lollipop kicks in
in an undisclosed feature that is folks
