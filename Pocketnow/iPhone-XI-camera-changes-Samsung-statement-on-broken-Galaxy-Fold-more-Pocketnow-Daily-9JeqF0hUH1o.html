expect several changes in the cameras of
the 2019 iPhones with the new Mac OS
update you should be able to use your
Apple watch for more stuff with your Mac
and tsmc is already working on a new 6
nanometer shift for next year I'm Jaime
Rivera and it's Thursday my galaxy fold
is still in top shape we have a full Q&amp;amp;A
on Instagram stories that you should
follow this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with other
corporate fix ups I mean you know that
just like Qualcomm and Apple weren't
getting along you can stream certain
services on Amazon's fired TV or
backwards when it came to Google as of
today or actually very soon you will be
able to use either casting for Amazon's
prime video over Google cast or
backwards be able to use Google services
on Amazon TV it's great to see that
these companies finally woke up and
smell the coffee that regardless of
whatever restrictions they pull people
will still consume whatever's better now
let's talk about the Galaxy fold
definitely a device that's providing a
ton of controversy because of the screen
issues there have been only five units
causing these problems out of I believe
a hundred units that were distributed
and so Samsung is confirming that they
will be looking into this extensively
that they're obviously providing
replacements they are telling everybody
not to remove the film that's there's
actually text in the plastic that says
do not remove the protective film and so
that's one of the causes for certain
issues I know that there were other
issues that weren't caused by this so
yeah according to Samsung we should not
expect any issues when it comes to the
final retail units which are coming very
soon now let's talk about tsmc as well
we got seven nanometer chips from them
as a pretty much last year now the
company has just confirmed it as of 2020
we should expect six nanometer which is
going to bring 18% more transistors and
just about everything within a chip it's
gonna make it more power efficient more
everything my god
I am shocked at how ARM chips are
getting so much more efficient and how
you know until regular chips are not so
yeah now let's move the spotlight over
to Apple
and whatever we should expect for mac OS
10.15 as we hear that like for example
right now you can unlock your Mac or
MacBook Pro with your Apple watch simply
because if your Apple watch as a
security key it understands that the Mac
can be unlocked you have that benefit
but apparently you will be able to use
it for Apple pay and just about some
other benefits right now you have string
of those blended benefits with the Apple
watch and iOS but Mac OS is a different
story so stay tuned for those changes
they should be coming soon as well and
finally the hottest news do they have to
do with men'she quo and predictions for
iphones according to what we should
expect
it seems that well we will be getting a
better selfie camera finally getting a
boost from 8 megapixels to 12 though
we're now getting specifics over what
additional benefits are brought by this
camera aside from the fact that
apparently it'll have a wider angle than
average so welcome to the world of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 I believe but then in
the case of the back for like the prime
phones it seems that there will be some
sort of blended coating to allow the
camera hump to not look as bad as we
currently see with iPhone tens and
tennessee's so yeah apparently the
rumors are that the stokke camera is
coming let us know in the comments down
below I mean what do you think better
selfie camera better coating at the back
to look better with the camera hump you
think that's good in my case I think
that's all great and a drop in the price
tag would be even better cuz deals for
Apple have been going crazy lately
that's just to me leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
those earlier follow us on pocketnow.com
ascribe to both of our channels english
and spanish for more videos like this
one you can follow me on twitter hi
managers quoting it on instagram 'but hi
metadata please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hanging
out any but I thank so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
