McAfee wants to protect your Galaxy s8
how necessary is virus software on a
phone we'll take a closer look at the
leaked 1 + 5 concept sketches and what's
the buzz on Google's fuchsia project are
we looking at the next generation of
Android make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 2 5 2 of the pocket
now weekly comin at ya may 11th at
around 2 p.m. Pacific time of course
because we're out I'm out here on the
west coast this weekly podcast is where
we dissect and discuss those gadgets
that make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and fuchsia was a color I was never cool
enough to pull off I'm still not cool
enough to ever wear fuchsia I'm Juan
Carlos bag now senior editor
pocketnow.com blasting the signal from
sunny Southern California actually not
so sunny this week we've got some
weather coming in and joined a via
remote patch we're trying something a
little different with this week's
podcast because plucky podcast producer
Jules Wong is out on the east coast but
he's doing a little traveling I was
going out there buddy boy
hey hey I'm in Brooklyn for some
interesting podcast and going on as well
it's sort of related to our industry but
yeah just here on quote unquote business
quote unquote business business he
cannot rightfully tell you about at the
moment lest he have to kill you I mean
it's I mean it does involve murder
essentially and the mob so I'd be like
if he's into of s town well you're close
enough it's crime crust that's what the
discuss all for Brooklyn for some reason
Oakland's straighter they're Brooklyn
they just went to Brooklyn you just you
I like please send all of your hate mail
to Jules Jules Wong pocket now but that
but yeah that's that's literally like to
get what's having discussion here and
yeah we're just going to do it in
Brooklyn I don't know why they decide to
hold it not in Providence or right where
that was held and you know well and and
also just for our show right now - we're
trying something a little different
because of this royal patch and if it
works maybe we'll have a new format for
the for the pocket net weekly I'm I'm
not good for now and for I'm not good at
running this thing live I'll just say
that right now like I'm super stressed
out about putting all these pieces
together but Before we jump into some
some some news topics and some other fun
conversation and chat Mr Wong would you
be so kind as to detail for our
listeners and our viewers how they can
get in contact with us for the show
that's pretty easy details you want to
talk to us and get some questions in for
us to answer at some point sooner or
later you can do the so at podcast at
pocketnow.com at the email that you
should be sending it to and if you
prefer to be more instant or social more
I don't know using less characters you
can use the hashtag P and weekly
wherever hashtags are accepted yes a
membership has its privileges so that's
how you can get in contact with us for
the show we are going through those
emails I mean one of the things that
take some of the fun out of producing
the show is not having that sort of live
instant chat happening with you guys and
gals and so we are collecting your
emails and your questions and we're
putting together a listener take the
wheel podcast hopefully for when we can
get back to live streaming these things
I think we're another good step in the
right direction for making that happen
so hopefully the next couple episodes
will have a system that we can engage
directly with you find folks again
that's enough BTS on the the pocket now
that's one small step for a podcast as
one giant leap for for podcasting yes
except for all of the other shows that
are doing this way better than we are
ATM um let's let's jump into some some
news here mr. washer I've got us all
queued up for
for your your top stories from
pocketnow.com or boy and guys we got the
stories we got to run the ad the full
rundown the full scoop
the four one one lets or the four or
five and that's nightmare so let's not
banal and let's get into it
the uncarrier maybe show enough some of
its rebel ways with word that t-mobile
is coming up with a TCL made phone or
three they only branded as Revell that's
re vvl with differentiating
differentiating models likely being
called t1 t2 and t3 at least one of them
is expected to spec the mid-range in
specifications but we don't have pricing
details numbers go on to say that
t-mobile will guarantee warranty and
insurance for the life of the device
management debut in the summer summer in
Mexico just got a little more
interesting smartphone geeks will not be
tanning at the beach the beaches of can
kitten but looking to Best Buy yes they
do have Best Buy's over there as well as
Sam's Clubs and couple for a chamois
phone the redmi note 4 it's expected to
go up at bergen waters as well as some
online shops for about 5500 pieces just
short of $300 the redmi note 4 x they
also come into play as well in an
interview with the verge an engineer on
the Microsoft Surface team said that USB
C was not included on the surface laptop
because of charging concerns the
recently released laptop instead comes
with a surface connect port with a
closed system of adapters and
accessories but with all the different
sorts of USB spec there on many of the
type C cables out there the main reason
why the connector was dropped was
worried that consumers would blame
Microsoft if they used a third-party
cable and the device suddenly shut down
or plugged in if you only barely
tolerate AVG or
looking at security because they're not
too offensively oppressing a can't
bother to uninstall the preloaded apps
McAfee protection is here to give such
apps a bad rap Samsung has a deal with
McAfee to preload its sweet
to all Galaxy s8 and Galaxy S II closer
devices you can get three a free 60-day
travel of live safe or web safe or live
a safe the president in a folks a
special offer after that and if you
don't know who John McAfee is you're
better off
finally selfie obsessed Chinese company
made to have something special roof
nettles not use no China no not a Hello
Kitty phones they've already done that
this is a limited edition device
packaged in a giant pink box and of
course if you're Sailor Moon you need a
wand a selfie wand 10,000 units are
going up for grabs when I'm not sure to
some of you are glad your arms don't
reach that far what do you think I you
know Sailor Moon was the show that I
kind of watched when I was in college a
little bit not too much
that I know that you're more of this
Cardcaptor Sakura type I mean you know
like I could pivot if I could pivot my
webcam easily I could show you the
scroll of Vegeta but I keep on Alden - I
guess what's just kind of interesting is
their their idea of accessorizing so you
know the whole branding and the pink and
the Sailor Moon and all that stuff
obviously isn't really quite my jam how
I use phones these days but the notion
of having kind of branded accessories
like this wand that we've got up on the
screen right now that's actually kind of
a smart idea that I think would be
really cool to expand into other devices
like if I really wanted to let my geek
flag fly and having a proper you know
like fallout themed phone would be
really rad with the war
old of gadgetry that we have in Fallout
and actual first party accessories that
kind of play into that aesthetic not
just like that pip-boy one-off
collector's edition thing but like a
pip-boy SmartWatch specifically yeah
well just still nuchal its charged with
nuka-cola a charge nuka-cola how many
caps did that cost you man that looks
expensive
don't even get me started about that but
are you maybe maybe you should maybe we
should change it to like it even get
yond so like what sharp yeah it's 20 if
I never saw a thang yeah what was a robo
tag I mean like even something silly
like I could I could maybe be persuaded
to rock some vampire hunter D
accessories I don't know what that would
look like a wooden stake that also
doubles ooh like a bluetooth handset or
something like that
it's about point you might as well just
get more mainstream and and stick with
Castlevania although you know what like
what's funny is I was not I was never a
huge Castlevania fan you know III got I
got drawn into anime way too young
because of vampire hunter D you see this
cartoon and it looks kind of dark and
edgy and I had no idea what I was
getting myself into and I probably
watched it a little younger than I
probably should have but I wanted to
circle to this other topic I mean
getting back and we don't talk a lot
about laptops and you know that kind of
gear but I wanted to get your thoughts
tools on this reasoning from Microsoft
about USB C being consumer confusing
being kind of a hassle and instead their
reply being a proprietary piece of
hardware kind of dongle rific iPhone
style um where do you think this is
going to land I'm really lukewarm on the
surface laptop personally and I don't
know where you're at with the surface
laptop but I have some issues with the
way that Microsoft has gone about not
only building this machine but then also
explaining some of the choices that
they've made
I mean like every so often when we talk
about this this or that Microsoft event
we've noticed how you know they've
become more Apple ish in terms of
presenting its its products hardware and
in terms of framing this product
especially when you have a clear analog
to just the regular map books there's
definitely something going on when it
comes to making the compromise for
design one of the biggest issues was
designed and did this for the engineer
but in terms of implementing just the
surface connect important I mean it's a
decent port its magnetic it's it's fine
it's okay
but in terms of blaming I think my
favorite go-to phrase now is in terms of
but when how should I say this alright
so when we're talking about type C we
have all these experts Google has it's
Benson Leung and then there's a whole
department of you know people that go do
compliance work on that and are very
vocal advocates and we've seen the
spread from Android manufacturers to
Apple on its laptop side not your mobile
side yet just yet but Microsoft seems to
me that it's allowing its OAM partners
who are making convertible laptops
convertible tablets to utilize USB even
Thunderbolt 2 right so well no I mean
like if this if this argument is we were
worried about consumers being confused
since I I got on the Thunderbolt 3 train
early I really feel like there's an
opportunity here for a manufacturer
who's looking to put out a premium
device like the like this surface laptop
to start a standard or to start a trend
like Apple has where
or maybe we only use USBC on the
peripherals and on portable devices like
phones and then all computers are going
to start licensing thunderbolt so that
it doesn't matter what direction you're
plugging things into you know we all
just agreed on thunderbolt abling and
the host computers for these you know
like your desktop or your laptop is
still probably your productivity hub or
your Center your brain your mobile
on-the-go solution doesn't need to have
thunderbolt obviously so we could set
the standard there and I think that
would clear up a lot of this consumer
confusion and I don't know because out
of the directories at work it's not
necessarily a sales leader it's a
standard bearer for new verticals
although right it's this is not really a
new vertical you could say but it's
something that delivers Windows 10 s
right you could say that you know does
that but still you would have to say
they have to realize at some point that
it's it's a firm piece of hardware that
they're doing and they're showing it off
and they're in the bragging about it to
students you you're too late at this
point the USB see this this was the time
this was the time to convert this was
the time to make sure that you had your
manufacturing lines all in place and
being very clear very educated about
this very you know you have a very
proactive audience if we're talking
about youth they should know so I think
that's a solvent of responsibility on
Microsoft's part to and take control of
this situation now I just I just wonder
though what was the backlash that Apple
received over dongle gate that Oh use
USB seaports in these Thunderbolt ports
mean I have to use all these dongles and
to a degree I mean I understand the
frustration and I really do wish that
more professional grade professional air
quotes grade laptops had a SD card
readers built
them for all of the creative
professionals out there they're shooting
content keep saying like disconnect port
is like a SD card slides not yeah see
that's that's the problem that I'm
running into is I can totally appreciate
an engineering concern over consumer
confusion but a solution which involves
dongles and proprietary hardware I find
to be I don't even know what word I want
to use there because I want to throw
something like disingenuous but that's
not the right word oh but it's a
solution that I don't think people are
going to be very happy about one USB
port a display port which I don't know
in my in my trade a display port a
family and friends that's not a cable
standard that anyone ever really
embraced even over a few of my friends
who have gear that uses like micro HDMI
I understand the advantages pros and
cons between the HDMI and DisplayPort
but that wasn't something that was ever
really sort of popularized in my sphere
in my in my sort of circle of influence
so again it's just sort of an I find
this to be some odd decisions and I
worry that because the surface pro has
been as successful a line of
convertibles as it has been that now
they're just sort of taking a couple
other stabs at other things that they
can try using the surface name to try
and drum up some interest and this
doesn't really feel like a
well-thought-out ecosystem approach to
hardware which I shouldn't be surprised
because I don't know that Microsoft has
ever had a really great ecosystem
approach to hardware outside of the Xbox
it's part of you know joining your your
weight around with the bully pulpit the
official is that you get to dictate what
is what makes sense for manufacturers in
terms of not alone I used to play I
totally agree with that what I worry
about is with their position as being
sort of the standards bearers that I
don't think I see my personal opinion
a Microsoft which is really thinking
about what that ecosystem in total
should resemble and this to me looks
like they're trying something and that
makes me super nervous because look at
all the things they've tried and sort of
walked away from and sort of revisited
and sort of walked away from especially
of anyone in our audience you know knows
that I used to be such a die-hard
Windows Phone fan this stuff is these
are the kinds of moves that give me
pause that make me concerned or
apprehensive about buying into this
ecosystem and I don't necessarily have
an answer to that I'm just saying that
it's it's it's a it's a move that could
be that can proved we toxic right it
just it would left unaddressed so that's
all I have for that well lastly I wanted
to get I wanted to get your thoughts on
McAfee - I just questioned the need for
a dedicated protection piece of software
on a mobile device I just haven't seen
the actual reports on threats that this
type of software would do a good job of
actively defending against no it's free
you get it for free it's fine
you just know so it's just use it just
have it be aware well because it's free
yeah that's right there you could just
use it you can it's fine you don't have
to touch you know don't even hear about
it don't think about insight I mean I
mean you're just going to be
disappointed when you hold the thing and
then you really can't get to the okay
there's no there's no delete it's just
information
you can't even disable the damn things
very very well put Jules well we also
have two additional news stories that
were heavy hitters on pocketnow.com so I
think we should bring in a guest to help
us unpack those stories some some
interesting conversation that I think we
can jump into there indeed so we'll get
to that just a second but before we do
you can see full details of these
stories and more hit pocketnow.com and
look for the podcast section to get to
this episode's rundown also be sure to
check out
véra and the puppet now daily on our
YouTube channel
BAM yeah two of these topics I really
want to unpacked dig a little deeper
chat a little bit with some more nuance
and to help us unpack those news stories
rear it we're bringing on the man the
myth the legend mr. n abang Etta thunder
II from bored at work thank you so much
for joining us to chat about the one
plus five and Google fuchsia thank you
very much for having me miss stuff why
I'm back now
it's always good to jump on the
PocketNow podcast so I am ready to chat
away
yes let's let's chat away so first of
all let's jump right into the 1 + 5 I
think this is going to be one of those
topics that it would help if I have the
right web page up there's going to be
one of those topics that I think is
going to have a lot of traction among
Android fans this is a this is
definitely a you know it's an enthusiast
phone the oneplus brand is always sort
of represented that kind of enthusiast
commentary I'm going to pull your little
window over there and I'm going to get
my face out of the way and perfect so
we've got these specs we've got these
leaks this could be that perfect melding
of dual rear cameras dual front cameras
now this has been a topic that we've
been covering sort of behind the scenes
at pocket now we're trying to figure out
how we want to talk about this but we've
got this race for the premium end of the
smartphone we're waiting to see which
manufacturers going to deliver a
thousand-dollar smartphone and then on
the flip side we've got this insane
competition from entry-level smartphones
from premium mid Ranger's people always
get super frustrated when I just say mid
rangers instead of premium mid rangers
and I wanted to get your take on some of
these some of these detailed drawings
you know because we're just looking at
some of the some of the you know it's
almost like engineering sketches of what
this phone could resemble does this
walking in the right direction for a
company like oneplus or should we be
expecting more from a brand that's sort
of built it's reppin
the no compromises flagship killing
smartphone
I mean first off the sketches look
wonderful I have to compliment whoever
did the sketches because it was me would
just be a rectangle two circles
I'd be like do this drawed camera there
you exactly something like that but you
know what I like it I like the dual
front cameras look a dual red cameras
are a constant now I mean Samsung is the
only company who just doesn't have one
that's pretty much it
but they have a really good camera on
their phone so one plus five having to
do all rear camera that they expected to
see the dual front-facing camera that'd
be something you know that could lease
Chris create some stare in the market
especially image selfie fans and if they
are trying to even expand some of these
sensibilities of being just in each
device and trying to explore maybe let's
let's be niche and let's also try this
get into one other segments that could
be it but in terms of decided it kind of
looks like the LG g4 from the renders
you know it's got its got that incurved
back the positioning of the cameras at
the rear remind me of the g4 in a sense
given the front of the device it's like
the g4 to me so hopefully it doesn't
look that way he still has that unique
oneplus styling cues even though I'm not
the biggest fan of your design I do like
that it's a little bit different from
everyone else so yeah that is something
this this was it that design note I
think it is very it's very well put um
especially because I think in the past
like I'm going through and I'm digging
up one plus 3t stuff we're going to be
trying to do a few comparisons before
the 1+5 lunches and putting that phone
back in my hand there's definitely that
feeling or that sense of like old HTC
and especially on these engineering
concept sketches the bottom of the phone
still to me very much resembles what we
solve from say the HTC 10 right you know
the phone tapers and curves I think your
point about where the cameras are
located definitely seems to be inspired
somewhat for maybe some of the work that
LG has done in the
and then I'll so that notion of dual
front-facing cameras like I don't have
we seen anything like that since the v10
I think the v10 was the only phone that
I remember making a major commercial
push with a separate wide-angle selfie
shooter yeah I think the 310 analogy
didn't do a good job in marketing of
that I think even one plus with its
small base but it's loud social media
presence can easily market that dual
front-facing camera no no so I think I
think that might be a play here this
year where you know it's going to have
an 835 processor in there it's going to
have 64 gigs of ram well whichever grid
maybe they'll include microSD this time
who knows I'm afraid it's going to have
all those things that you expect any
flashes device so it's a matter of what
can you you know separate themselves
this year now it looks like you know
life style features might not be in we
don't know when I speaking of water
resistance or wireless charging maybe
not of course if people just add too
much money either to device so I think
that dual front-facing camera might be
where they will go to say hey this is
something we're doing difference here's
something for a different segment and
also for our key fans of you know within
the core Android space now you can take
better selfies and you get better
wide-angle shots you can also you can
also vlog better I mean you don't have
to take selfies just real frog amazing
camera too and you can also do your
vlogs in to video recordings and things
like that so I think we just have to
wait and see once this device comes out
the sad part about it is that you know
spec wise every device is the same yeah
that that that's too too sad part about
2017 with smartphones is right LG G 6
other than the fact that g6 was an 8 21
but even that to you like whatever
we know the Samsung Galaxy devices
whatever HTC comes out one plus 5 all
these devices will have very similar
specs the diff
lay in camera and the display being
Samsung makes really great displays in
the own LG has good displays and
everybody else is buying from you the
Samsung LG so right well let's unpack a
few of these rumors real quick before we
move on I know in these concept sketches
they're they're talking about maybe
starting to incorporate ceramic so this
would be a 2 panel rear body very
similar to what we saw in the pixel but
instead of glass there would be a
different feel up around the camera
module maybe to help improve radio
reception I doubt that we'd want to put
I thought they'd be able to put charging
coils directly underneath the cameras if
the the ceramic panels that small but do
you think that material choice could
help be a distinguishing factor or do
you think that that's too subtle a
design change to get consumers
interested you know like right now it
seems like if it's pretty in its glass
then people think it's nifty outside of
that no one really seems to have moved
the needle on using different materials
you see I don't know when it comes to
one plus because you know the core
audience is a is hardcore Android
audience so you throw ceramic the first
thing we call out is oh wow you know you
copy Google so what you know it's it's a
what's the name of the Google device I
just forgot it Jesus you either pixel
like yeah I was a lot to say next but
like no no that's not it that's not it
it's it's a pixel you know and I'm not
sure how that will play within you know
that that community itself
right you're willing to accept it as
something different from them or you
know company the Nexus and you know how
that also affects its comparison to the
Galaxy S a because it's going to be
compared to that device no matter what
all the LG G six right so either for me
I think with a company like oneplus also
cost wise why bother
I think you I think you should either
have a solid design and work all the
materials that usually work with and
then add features that would give you an
exponential boost and you know that
little piece of ceramic that I don't
think it does much
right I'm so expanding the abased well
and also it makes me concerned because
III think ceramics are going to be that
that bleeding edge kind of design
material are we worried about a material
that's potentially more brittle than
aluminum will it be as durable as glass
I can already see the gadget destruction
porn from people that are going to make
conclusions off of dropping one phone
over and over and over again like well I
dropped it six times from waist height
and then when I dropped it from from ear
height it completely shattered you're
like well yeah because you've been
breaking this phone multiple times over
and over and over again I I just want to
circle back real quick do you think that
lifestyle features on a phone that's
probably going to be sub $500 I would
imagine oneplus is going to try and
continue playing under that threshold
you know if we don't get word on
enhanced drop resistance or we don't get
word on enhanced water resistance do you
think that that's going to be something
that carries over into the enthusiast
base like oneplus fans do you think that
that's going to affect the purchasing
decision or do you think that those
people are probably more focused on a
quad HD display with a Qualcomm 835 yeah
I agree I think that people are focused
on the quad HD display and 835 the
lifestyle features you know I think just
going for my reaction a lot of people
like yeah you know my oneplus to be
teased almost as good as my god to the
s8 the only difference is they got CS a
it has water resistance and wireless
charging I don't need that in the rack
that audience is always Adam out about
that kind of stuff and I think even for
one plus the cost of putting that and
the fact that they haven't done it
before so I'm even sure how good they
will be with first implementation in
terms of issues and things like that I
think it's one of those areas where
these no need to the closest thing you
might get would be durability testing
that I think it's something that is more
attractive for that core core base where
you can say okay yeah you know you can
drop the Galaxy s8 I controlled my
oneplus it doesn't crack you know that
I'm afraid it's something that you get
that people who say that people would
just accept more on the lifestyle
feature too you know where it's $500
they still would be okay with that
imagines or high jump yeah I'll be
really curious to see how some of these
things play out because you know oneplus
got us to 64 gigabytes of storage as
sort of a standard though they did it at
the same time by not allowing microSD
card expansion one of the things
actually thought was kind of frustrating
on the one plus 3t because you had a
dual SIM phone you know like you had two
two card slots and they just didn't want
to put in the combo slot which could
have been either a micro SD card or dual
SIM though I still have to question
people outside of the the rabid
enthusiast community the the sort of
hardcore smartphone fans I know so many
friends and family who just never bother
using something like a micro SD card
like I'm even kind of debating with my
wife because her Galaxy s7 is full and
she's playing with Amazon photo storage
and onedrive and Google Photos she's
doing all this cloud backup and she's
still full on the phone and sort of
reticent to add another piece of
hardware like a memory card just to
offload some of that stuff from the
internal storage I that last talking
point for a company like oneplus do you
think we've all moved on do we think the
cloud is robust enough for consumers out
there or is it just sort of the general
ignorance or apathy like I didn't put
the card in when I first got the phone
so now I'm just going to use the phone
exactly how it came out of the box uh
you are right on both I think the first
thing is yes I didn't put that SD card
in there so you know I'm not bothered to
do it anymore and it's easy for me to
download an app and go between these we
look at apps faster than we look on
hardware right you know that's that's
the state of affairs the other problem
too is that transferring content from sd
card is still not easy until until SDF
transfer is as easy as switching between
two hard drives on a PC
that that will be the point where you
know people will care but at this point
cloud storage is where everyone's going
to so I think I think one place has has
written that way right long enough where
you know if they offer is 64 to 128 then
people just I just get 120 and I've done
yeah that's what it is isn't that
something that that Apple has sort of
helped and I'm using like air quotes
helped educate consumers that you just
want the one with more jeebies right you
know that outside of that you shouldn't
have to think about managing the
hardware of your phone until it's time
to buy a new phone yeah I suppose done
that quite effectively over the last
what eight years or how long they've had
the iPhone sorry nine years this weekend
they've done that but effectively you
know Apple users are unknown for
complaining about 62 bytes of storage
and looking for ways to try and offload
it till you know iCloud showed up so one
plus I think is taking that to the
advantage by Emmys often the amount of
basic storage you have any advice and
using that as a way to say look we need
64 gigabyte you need that much rank at
least now if you go to 128 so I think
they're fine because you know but the
way things are cloud storages is good
enough where you have the options
between onedrive you have Google Cloud
Google cloud and it's all Dropbox so you
can you can manage with all three to
dispose of your excess photos now I just
just to wrap up one plus five as a sort
of a fan of Android what would you want
to see this company push forward for
their new initiative I mean like I said
at the top of this we're seeing an
intense squeeze from the lower and mid
range er phones and I think there is a
growing consumer sentiment for what is
it that I'm really getting when I'm
throwing down seven eight nine hundred
dollars like if you account for sales
tax in California the Galaxy S 8 plus is
almost a thousand dollar phone out the
door what would you want to see one plus
mu
as a company not necessarily just what
what tech is built into their phone but
one plus is a company what do you think
their next move should be to try and
shake up this conversation ah better
marketing you said this before last
couple years I think I think one plus is
adding a very distinct advantageous
position they're the company who they
have the history of say hey we've built
premium at mid-range price you know and
we have premium for you but the problem
is if not going to this message past
core audiences right so incidentally
maybe ceramic is part of that message
where yes it's an aesthetic feature but
when your marketing and advertising you
can now showcase people that here is
something that's really premium and it's
only you know subtract under dollars so
I think I think if they can come up with
a at this this is the fourth one plus
device or factually fit what what
everyone wants to forget the oneplus X
except for people who owned the oneplus
X know when I'm counting the workflow
echoes counting 1 + 1 2 3 3 T and then 5
this would be 5 devices
X doesn't count now well I guess we
should say 5 flagship device yeah I
already got you know what there's just a
fact that you say that I've already I
know I've already gotten angry comments
from people who are you rocking the
oneplus X exactly uh but but they they
have that history they've created
something and they've spent you know
four years doing it it's about time you
grow up yeah about time that your
marketing changes you know you talked
about this in the past of saying look it
takes at least three years for company
to get the right product and that was a
1 + 3 + 3 T yeah that was that's the
point one person really like yet now
we've done well energy how many growing
up significantly because that was also
the first time they didn't do this like
pre-order lottery system thing or yeah
like holds your place in line with the
ticket kind of shenanigans and they
actually just had a regular proper
pre-order system what what do you do you
think that the next step on that is I
mean so marketing has definitely got to
be a part of that equation
but do you think this is a company that
could maybe start fulfilling orders for
some kind of carrier tie-in because I
think one of the issues with oneplus is
you know we saw so many people were on
backorder with the 1+3
that then they kind of just got rolled
into the 1 + 3 T when they shifted over
and they stopped making the 3 I might my
fear is like could this company push too
aggressively
and then not actually be able to deliver
on the hardware that they're trying to
produce if I 1 plus I think my marketing
strategy will be very simple and looking
one is looking for carrier partner in
the u.s. then I say go to t-mobile
t-mobile is always happy to throw some
kind of wrench into the bucket yeah so I
think if you can get t-mobile on the
line I think what you want to do as one
plus is you want to come out and you
want to be clear you know how much you
can manufacture I mean I think you want
to if if I have them you know play the
blue ocean approach change the game and
say hey look we're still a small company
but we like to deliver the best and
right you can spin it a little bit and
say because of manufacturing because we
wanted to do the best we have batches of
units and this is this is what we're
doing whether it's 100,000 or 500,000
for fast batch that is what you have
please place orders and once it's filled
up we'll let you know in the next
batches and hopefully it's within a
given timeframe and then if you do that
for three months then you kick off with
your partnership with t-mobile at that
time you should easily you know
fulfilled all your orders and then you
use to mobilize your second punch that
goes into three months will be September
holiday season
running on the Hansa back-to-school
season you know then you can now mix in
with that proud of saying hey if you
don't want to get an iPhone you can get
a long plus if you don't want to get a
GOx you know this is something my you
get on t-mobile for a you know $15 a
month
yeah well and that that you know the the
t-mobile partnership oneplus as a
hardware company just feels like they
would be very much akin to an uncarrier
sort of mentality right the
try to shake things up we're trying to
to buck trends we're trying to to move
the needle on how you buy your phone and
what you should be looking for so um I
know we're we're kind of running up on
just a little extra time here cuz I know
you have to get going but I wanted to
spend a little time talking about your
thoughts on Google fuchsia so we got a
sneak peek at some of the developer
stuff for what it could be potentially
maybe I don't know Google's next
operating system and I don't know have
you had a chance to look through some of
the stuff that that's leaked out I just
saw the video before we started taking a
look at it as card-based
I kind of skipped through it I wasn't
impressed but then again is really
that's just my first impression I saw
the card based system I'm not a fan of
card based systems right now
even with Google now and some of the
stuff with big speed I've been using it
just kind of mostly I don't know why I
guy I like desktop I want to see my
wallpaper so yeah but we're all old and
like set in our ways and all I just want
to go back to Windows 3 no I mean I mean
let's be frank ok people ask me for my
wallpaper so I I guess be a lot of
people like me out there and want it I
get the idea of the cards right my
problem is I'm not sure so now it's
going to work I this is what I am
thinking I'm going for armadillo oh is
that what it is right mm-hmm ok I'm a
Dillo to me should have been the next
progression of Google now
because unless the cart system works
hand in hand together with it because I
think the next the next job in mobile
operating system is voice and I think
that needs to be proved drastically
where you know you know not just the
fact that you're driving in a car but
the fact that you know if I have an
earpiece or SmartWatch and I'm giving
man
I'm getting information back like I
think we're at that point where we can
get some of those functionalities from
movie her in our smartphones at this
point so I don't say all the way but
some of that so I would like to see more
of that than to see cards and I
hopefully the cons are tied together
with that then that would be one press
but since it was no audio we didn't know
exactly what this is right I'm still
very unsure where they've gone with this
I think aesthetically at this point if
you just throw out a card based system
os people hate it just I think now at
this present point in time yeah it
definitely for me I mean looking at what
they're trying to do design wise
certainly runs up against that problem
that we've talked about especially on
your show and on your podcast that
consumers want something new and
exciting and fresh and different so long
as it looks and feels and does exactly
what their visit yes right and so I'm
looking at what some some of these
really interesting design concepts on
fuchsia and first of all the first thing
I think is okay this this looks like it
needs to be a chroma West replacement I
there you go that looks that looks very
obvious especially they're trying to
show off like multi-panel you know four
panels of information up on one screen
at a time and it's sort of a more three
by two aspect ratio less a phone aspect
ratio but one of the things that I think
is really compelling is the notion of
Google changing the underpinnings of
Android or Chrome OS the core
architecture that lives underneath and
so obviously this is super fresh this I
mean not super fresh this is super raw I
this could be a project that has legs it
could be something which we know Google
loves to just cancel you know like we
don't love it anymore so we're just
going to kill it but do you think that
this is this is the right time that
we're taking those baby strategies
towards walking away from Linux as the
kernel underneath Android going to
completely Google designed underpinnings
old design and developer codebases
languages is this what we need for the
next evolution of android or do you
think Android can continue in its
current state of of development I mean I
sure can
it's Linux Linux is goddamn flexible man
you can do anything with it so on that
aspect you can its what Google wants to
do this way I mean also there's the
lawsuits and you know getting away from
that I am saying that as a company I
think with armadillo do I you're right
saying that Chrome OS yes I can see that
going to Chrome OS and being something
on that aspect or platform or you may be
the tablet of some sort yeah on a
smartphone not so much because it get
the visual representation because what
if what I think we will be fighting is
not just people saying I don't like this
but you're also fighting the
representations from your two biggest
competitors right it's called Samsung
and what is called Apple and Samsung is
not going to change this anytime soon to
look like they may use the same money
kernel but they are not changing to look
like a bunch of cards flown on the
screen and Apple is still the way it is
I was not changing any time soon so
you're gonna have that fight where
people now like you said you know people
are going to go okay you know maybe some
of us will go this is great it's really
fast it works well we can do under 50
things that work here but it's a bunch
of grand white cards yeah I mean I'm not
in college anymore I don't have a liking
of you know flip notes to go through so
you know I got that if it's tied to you
it is tied to voice I can see where they
trying to go with it but again you don't
need to have a card system to have it
tied to voice to do anything functional
for you so to me that is just more
repository of world information you just
ask for can be housed which is great on
one side of your screen right so I'm not
sure where
this will go I'm not sure what Google
will do and knowing Google very well you
know there is a I'll given a 65 percent
chance that he might be can't have a
probability you know
then working all what at least they'd
probably be something in there that
would they will use in future projects
I'll say I'm that level this there's
give me something they can take out of
it but the way it looks now and what I'm
seeing I just don't see the consumer
base go for it business you said people
want something you're fresh that still
looks old
yeah well and and is familiar this is
the thing that always bugs me is like
let's say Google makes the most
intuitive air quotes intuitive OS ever
made just the fact that it's unfamiliar
mean someone's gonna play with it for a
minute and go oh I can't use it I don't
understand how it works it's no it's no
good and then they'll put it aside and
then they'll go back to what they're
already currently using your point about
the lawsuits I think is a really
compelling one for a company where
Google's at as a company or alphabet at
as a company getting away from any
software which could potentially step on
another company's toes like Oracle the
number of Appeals that that lawsuit has
currently gone through and then also
this notion of having more control over
the kernel the kernel of the of the
underpinnings of this OS not being quite
in Google's control means that they've
run into some problems with some of
their future updates versus the control
that companies like welcomed have over
this mobility space so that you know we
were just recently talking you know like
a phone like the oneplus X what was at
the Qualcomm 801 or 805 I can't remember
a theater I think I think you're right I
think it was the 805 and someone will
correct me in the comments because I'm
probably talking crap
but regardless anything before the 808
or the 810 is sort of now dead for
future major updates you know they can't
move that phone up into future at you
know more current versions I shouldn't
even say future current versions of the
Android operating system there are some
security issues with the current
relationship between
this the the kernel that's used for
Android wear Google that in development
and again the chipsets that a lot of
these older phones are still running I
mean like the number of Galaxy s3 and
galaxy has Wars out in the smartphone
ecosystem are still staggering so if
Google had control over that over that
kernel over that over that hardware the
hardware and software I mean wouldn't
that give Google a bit more synergy for
future fixes for future updates and
hopefully our devices last a little bit
longer if it's a what's ridiculous is
that what I'm what I'm suggesting here
is Google moving to a more closed
ecosystem they can still put a bunch of
stuff out as open source but they would
be the ones sort of building the little
garden around this kernel as opposed to
using some of the accepted standards
that Android currently utilizes uh yeah
I do agree but then it becomes ILS this
is it I mean it's a closed box so I mean
that's what they have to face and that's
what they have to deal with we're not
trying to okay I'm not trying to bring
myself into this but you know my stuff
perfectly has build going on this week
right and he talked about how you can
build iOS apps using Windows and even
Microsoft has gone away from being my
person have done some changes they went
from being very open it'll be closed now
they go back to be a little bit more
open again because you need to have
partnerships with Linux they have to
decide to deal with links to to solve
that issue and to me Google can do the
same thing you know you can solve this
problem and also create an ecosystem for
yourself but if you want to totally
build all the way through developers
will still come back because they have
to can you have the second-biggest
operating system out actually
technically it is the biggest because I
have more devices running on there so
the they will definitely come back to to
do Android but they'll be loved you know
complaining people be angry in terms
like that so that's something that they
have to actually look at to see it
is more viable in the long term which
will cause less headaches 7 is the
lawsuit a few years ago of cosmetic
headaches but hey companies like to
fight with lawyers well and I think
what's kind of interesting is who would
this cause more headache for versus who
would it solve headaches for so you know
if someone's out there and they're a
really passionate member of like
xda-developers and they love cutting
custom roms you know Google sort of
closing off the future of their
operating systems with something like
fuchsia certainly throws a wrench in
what they might be able to do I'm
potentially hypothetically I could also
surprise us and make it ridiculously
easy to get in there using their
languages to develop roms
I doubt that what happened well I think
but sighs sorry sorry excite - that
would be everyone else who sort of
languishes with this relationship of
Google - manufacturer - carrier might
see just a little bit of an abbreviation
for how updates bug fixes patches
security problems are rectified and so
are we
is it time to maybe have that
conversation where for the greater good
um that we start closing down Android we
start closing down chrome - potentially
better service the vast majority of
people and unfortunately that just means
enthusiasts and the techie members of
our respective audiences kind of get the
shaft again okay I'm not really I'm not
Piper versed in in how open or closed
Android is I always compare everything
to Windows Windows right in the most
open operating system out there and we
this has done a very good job in
clamping down remember we just had it a
virus problem that was I mean it was it
was like a plague every month there was
a new virus and Microsoft took steps
into handling that where you know
Windows is more secure than iOS am
nihilist Matthew listen Alex as of last
year you could change this year who
knows in terms of when it comes to virus
attacks and things like that but
Google could probably take some of the
same steps that Microsoft it I don't
know exactly how but to your other point
I do think yes for the greater good it
does make sense for a company life is
looking from the company perspective
they have seen that people who also
complain are developers developers are
lazy that is the general theme to this I
didn't call you lazy I'm just saying
this is what everybody else says so
accept ball with a bomber with
developers developers so because that's
that's your guy right there but
developers but I mean even if I was a
developer I don't want to switch from
Linux web builds all this stuff and then
have to move over yes here tools and we
saw that with Microsoft with Windows
Phone where they had some really awesome
tools that they all they said is you
throw your app in there you click a
button and then it cancels over and yet
that was Windows Phone but it's just you
still get level of great writer people
well and we saw something similar with
Apple when they switch and when they had
like cocoa and Yelpers waited until
proper legacy support had just been
removed before they really did shift
programs over to that new that new code
language so I think those will be really
interesting because I think something
needs to start changing though it really
seems like all of the companies that are
responsible for our mobile gadgets are
playing very conservative you know we
get a little kind of a graphics update
here slightly better battery life there
and no one's looking to rock the boat
too severely on like UI or the
underpinnings of the architecture or
what the next energy because you know
like Google's also trying at the same
time to front web apps again you know
sort of what is it called persistent Web
Apps something like that where you like
little bits of code or installed on your
phone but it's not like you really
install Yelp you just get the benefits
of some of yelps underpinnings while
you're online at the same time so
something obviously is brewing yes where
we end up I think I think no one's sure
where to go I think that is probably
what it is I think a lot of you won't
find different saying
means Microsoft in a way is actually
safe because they no longer in the
mobile space which saturated fat that's
happened there so they can go with a
very structured approach to advancing
forward and with you know but some of
the things announced and build I can see
them moving more to voice yeah and less
with this as opposed to Google where
Google is in the state where they can
move to voice quite easily but they also
need to make change the co operating
system itself right at the same time so
I think we're making situation where a
lot of people will play it safe for
maybe another two three years where we
get to the Year you know you know like
2012 definite 2012 so you do well that's
why that's when that's when the world is
going to end so actually that's a
product I'm - I didn't know why back in
time and so on
Wow 20/20 vision yesterday here baby my
brain time travel back to 2000 were
happier days back then
good morning 12 but yeah I mean 2020 20
will be probably time when you see
companies you know because it's also you
know we're going to ha get visit numbers
in our in a count where companies to
start going you know this is past most
science fiction movie and things like
that so now we have to give you
something that kind of matches your
curiosity you know I sit down here
waiting for my Starship Enterprise I
don't have it yet right like you know
I've got these awesome smartphones but I
don't have my tricorder yet that's
that's clown shoes well um III know
you've got to get going I've kept you a
little longer than we intended but thank
you so much for jumping in and helping
us kind of chew through some of this
info there two of the the bigger stories
on pocket now this week and so there's
definitely some anticipation some
excitement about what what Google and
what oneplus might have coming down the
pipe where can people catch your
coverage your content around the web the
Twitter's the youtubes the websites yeah
it's very simple its board up were calm
start with two O's in the board section
and you can find the website boardwalk
you can follow me on YouTube it's also
border work and then on Twitter what
work Instagram is border work as well so
it's very simple singing cross sport and
you're also covering some some gaming
and TV content doing your reviews and
your reaction videos yes yes yes thank
you for reminding me that I just keep I
just came back from a trips a little bit
why that fun I do have about a full
plate today so I was happy you can work
as in I do have a youtube channel where
we do love comical TV show reviews and
reaction it's called onboard go end and
of course board as you'd expect and then
we have a gaming channel called board
gamers when we do some gameplay reviews
and things like that for gaming so check
us out on all those networks yes please
check him out on all of those networks
also his weekly podcast of which I'm a
I'm a regular guest and I really enjoy
that long-form conversation so when
you're done with the popular weekly of
course then go check out the board at
work weekly podcast and you can get your
weekly fix in two flavors or all of your
effect news thanks so much for joining
us man I'll be joining you on Saturday
so we can continue the conversation then
yes thank you very much and yeah thank
you I said thank you again that's anger
that's staying in the podcasting I
always love having Anna bond on the
shows he's one of my favorite cats to
talk to about this kind of stuff there
you have it folks another episode of the
PocketNow weekly has come and gone the
show is over but the conversation
continues on twitter where you can find
Anna bong again as at board at work
Jules is at Point Jewell and I'm humbly
at some gadget guy pocket now is around
the web Twitter Instagram Facebook
Google+ YouTube and our home site
pocketnow.com shows like this cannot
exist without your support sharing the
weekly with your friends who love mobile
technology and by dropping reviews on
iTunes stitcher Google Play and wherever
pie tat reviews can be left because
ultimately there wouldn't be a show if
it weren't for our listeners and
subscribers who have kept us on the air
since 2012 the pocket out weekly will be
back next week with all kinds of
delicious technology goodness so make
sure you tune back in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
