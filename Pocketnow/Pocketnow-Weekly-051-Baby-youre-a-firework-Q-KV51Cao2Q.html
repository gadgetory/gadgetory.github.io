makes sense to discuss a uniquely
American smartphone story and we'll do
that a little bit today and also will
bring in some news and views from a lost
interview with our friends in the great
white north and maybe we'll finally find
out why Taylor Barton loves to hate on
Instagram welcome to the pocket now
weekly the once-a-week podcast from
pocket now where we discuss smartphones
tablets in the state of mobile
technology in 2013 I'm your host Michael
Fisher editorial director at pocket now
and today I'm joined by Taylor
hateration Martin good morning to you
hello and reach a duration and by Joe
the baby you're a firework Levi welcome
back to the show and it's been forever
it has been forever it's gonna be now
it's uh there's some confusion may be
about why I named Joe Levi after a kelly
clarkson song that is gonna fuckin right
I don't know yeah we know those who
knows it's all hear about it in the
comments well yeah I'm sure we will in
stream stuff i don't know i don't know
that stuff too popular but i don't
listen to it unless it's country and ask
our next car wait don't leave that down
in super go well the thing is Joe you
Jose a busy man outside of pocket now as
you know Joe are you gonna write it get
to know Joe Levi piece are you on the
schedule for that I haven't been
scheduled yet but I but you don't have a
known good i'm gonna be worried about
what they think about me no good i just
cuz i know there are some g members who
didn't want to do one so they're not
doing one but I know oh good alright
good so we'll find out about Joe Levi's
interesting life in a future peace but
the most interesting thing to me is that
I think last night if all went according
to plan you were on some like fireman
radios taken care of fireworks
administration right yeah so my wife
just got her ham radio license I've had
mine for a year and a half year two
years now I guess you want to share your
handle again I am kf7 em wa yeah ham
radio for you guys who grew up in the
80s and 90s NWA that's a well I'm not
gonna say an oz
musical group but I'm not gonna say the
name or somebody's gonna Paula Deen me
off the show I am speechless so about
the firework about the fire yeah so ham
radio one of our charters is providing
communications in emergencies and you
know just other public venues and
whatnot it's completely non for profit
we cannot charge a dime for what we do
but we work very closely with the
Emergency Response systems whether
that's fire police in this case it was
the police department over in layton
utah my alma mater went right by late in
high school and we you know the the cops
that are there they were all in charge
of traffic control and and people
control I guess you know and that us on
on the radio we were there to provide
emergency communications for them and
also to keep all of the people out of
the blast zone the danger zone there's
another old movie reference for you so
in case in case that our international
listeners don't don't don't get a dumb
sure everybody does on the fourth of
july in America we set off a bunch of
fireworks because you know explosions or
lotions and lotions have yeah loud
noises and with scarin dogs Rockets red
glare yeah and often this results in
hundreds of people gathering to sit
under the fireworks and an O and so so
Joe what kind of radio were you using to
to administer this thing where you
handheld or were you in like a big ol
rig that needed a truck to carry around
well first of all we had closest
estimates 5,000 to 7,500 people at this
high school and park area LA and all of
us with the ham radios we were inside
the blast zone so it was amazing I got
to hear and not see the fireworks
because I was so close the radio I was
using was a handheld it's a little 5
watt yaesu it was awesome and amazing
I the one thing to bring all this back
to so what we talked about a pocket now
because we're not you know ham radio now
hmm there were so many people there
regardless of who your carrier was and I
had my two phones with me i had the
galaxy s4 verizon edition and my nexus 4
on t-mobile and even though i had full
bars everywhere i could not get any data
and phone calling was very very spotty
at best but AM radio always came through
yeah well yeah that there's that whole
spectrum question right that whole yeah
and plus the back hall and all that
stuff but I bet Joe and tell me if I'm
wrong here i bet that SMS worked pretty
flawlessly i use google voice so if i
don't have data I don't have text oh
right indeed while use google voice's my
usually i usually forward to the i
usually receive via SMS because of
situations like that if i go to like
Fenway or something or you know
someplace where there's many tens of
thousands of people I still want to be
able to communicate and SMS messages
don't take up much bandwidth at all it's
not a bad idea well until just recently
I had to pay ten cents a message for my
SMS so why was sauce uh yeah but now I'm
I'm unlimited absolutely frickin
everything on t-mobile and I'm happy so
I could switch that over now yeah and I
switched over to the tmobile a simple
choice whatever it is planned simple I
can't remember the name of it but yeah I
switched over and I'm happy I'm just not
happy with their coverage and Charlotte
yeah their coverage in in Boston leaves
something to be desired as well or at
least in my part of awesome but it's
okay cuz I simplement with AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon yes it's kind of weird you super
just buried in phones all the time yeah
somebody's like do you have data here
I'm like let me check my three phones I
got one who's your carrier yeah yeah
everyone speaking of AT&amp;amp;T and mobile
devices we have a an announcement to
make which we already made but we'll
make it on the podcast since it was a
podcast giveaway we have a winner in our
LG optimus G giveaway isn't that
exciting awesome
hey the LG optimus G that gently used LG
optimus G we were giving away formerly
Brandon minimums recently used in an
episode of pocket now after the buzz our
Smash Hitz Emmy award-winning series not
really we were up for an Emmy though you
definitely definitely think so yeah I
but in a webby please d I was gonna say
the webby but that since that's like
feasible in the anyway please join us in
congratulating Julian bruh civic Brecca
Vic and sorry Julian I can't pronounce
things of Australia who will be taking
home the LG optimus G so that's going to
go out i think tomorrow in tomorrow's
mail and it should arrive in australia
sometime in 2014 so I think we call it
the post in Australia they do indeed and
I I wasn't taken an appetite not Google
cinemates no no yeah now I would
unfortunately we will yeah it'll be
strapped to a raven unfortunately with
the we couldn't give devices away to
everybody who left us an itunes review
but we did manage to get quite a few
more reviews of the pocket and weekly
podcast so thank you everyone for
entering and for helping us out the the
more I toons reviews you get on a
podcast the more visible the podcast
becomes his thing and I want to make
clear we were not asking for only
positive reviews but thankfully the
lowest review we were received on this
round was 4 out of 5 stars so really
thank you everybody and I am very
visible awesome well into the person who
left us four out of five we know who you
are I mean no nsl and well oh and we
love you wait a minute what this lady's
one star you couldn't give us one more
star what the hell it's probably cuz I
interrupt everyone I love that so gently
lifted just dealer that up I feel like
we I feel like we talked about that on a
show previously but just to everyone who
says Taylor stop interrupting in the
comments Taylor was instructed to
interrupt this very first bugging our I
was like come on the rule I hate dead
air please just if there's silence just
talk so it is my fault I've created this
monster and now I have to deal with it
yeah own it you never told me to do that
you mean I could have been like talking
over the top of you this whole time well
it was it for you know
that was when the show was more content
focused you know you know it's different
yeah and now since Brandon thinks we're
boring were not content focused
Brandon's taking a break Brendan's a new
dad what Ellis well he's about to be a
new daddy yeah that wasn't like
yesterday no well the due date was
yesterday but anyway yeah babies you
know your promptness these kids today
don't she's going to extra innings what
I'm saying it's on her own schedule what
do you think boy open should we talk
about wow wow oh god should we talk
about mobile technology maybe do you
think I was having fun talking about
babies I know not me not me i was having
no fun let's talk about mobile
technology cuz i won't talk about
America it's still the fourth you know
what I mean nothing it really is the
fifth but here's the thing it's the long
weekend it's still the fourth until we
have to go back to work on Monday that's
true this is my second monday this week
so yeah i do you think very amazing week
yeah so if this podcast seems a little
disjointed everybody it's because we had
a day off yesterday and now we're back
to work and we're gonna b day off
tomorrow so it's a difficult life but
our brains just can't really work it out
I know everyone out there should just be
completely and totally wow you know
journey do so much for you the listeners
because of the Gulf like Joe had dropped
off and he was gone for like 10 minutes
so it feels like we've been talking for
a half hour but really I think in the
final product we're only but it's like
five minutes and i'm not sure but here's
the thing we have a headline which I
love from Taylor Martin and yes this
show apparently is what did Taylor
Martin write this week because I'm not
the only one who thought no you're not a
joke Joe I through you some some love
though we we got your thing because the
thing is your review isn't up yet but
the thing is the Moto X the motorola x
phone sex fon will become a victim of
its own hype says taylor martin of
pocket now I wonder why yeah so we've
gotten a lot of news on the Moto X phone
if you haven't been following up on this
listeners we this past week has been a
like a bevy of leaks and may be
controlled leaks we don't know and just
motorola news in general we have the
motorola new motorola branding that we
discussed on last week's show
and we're finally starting to get word
about what the company wants to do to
make this phone that customizable like
this you should make a smart phone your
own experience it shouldn't be you know
mainstream that kind of thing we had
been hearing that from the marketing
messages but we hadn't really seen what
they were going to do and I don't know
what to think about it because on the on
the surface it appears to be that the
company is going to let you choose your
color not just the badge number but also
your trim color which is pretty cool and
you can also engrave it and there's
something on the software side that I'm
not sure so what you can use in the
matter um photo right you can snap the
roto and send it to Motorola and then
your phone arrives and then when you
unbox it it has your photo as a
wallpaper yay yeah i'm just good now in
their defense setting a photo as
wallpaper is so difficult to do I mean
you gotta take the picture it is yeah
and then you gotta do that button that
says use as right say if you're using a
phone it's not easy you have to go into
the settings and go to the
personalization so it doesn't mean yeah
Thank You HTC is the hardest rather yeah
but so it do we have in well at least
work too well usually I suggest maybe
didn't in the case of the the Moto X we
have a device that's not just like a
middle of the road you know mid-run
device that the company's already had
its big reveal this is the phone that
the company is coming back into
visibility with yeah it just doesn't
make sense to me and it doesn't look all
that it looks like they are sacrificing
you know a little bit of bombast in
exchange for a philosophical statement
that looks like it's going to land with
it with a thud is that the point of your
piece Taylor I mean it looks like it
looks like an HTC first from Motorola
oman yeah it does it looks like a first
or a nexus for that that's exactly what
it looks like with colors but the reason
i say it's a victim of its own hype is
it's not entirely mo
rule is fault it's part Motorola's fault
for making this huge comeback this big
splash this is the new motorola and
we're making mid-range phones that
doesn't really speak too much of anyone
anymore it used to be nobody really
cared we'd go buy this phone because a
little free now people are like I won't
that s for because it's great it's got
the best of everything I want that HTC
One because it's got the best of
everything so in these contexts you've
got everything that was motorola the
kevlar back the big motorola m we know
what a motorola phone is we know what it
looks like it's got a following it's got
people who acknowledge it and love it
and the new one ain't it it's not the
same thing anymore so you're alienating
all those motorola fans in the process
so that Joe that's a really good point
and I want to make clear that we haven't
seen final hardware yet obviously we've
just seen leaked images of that covers
and like leaked whatever but you're
right it does not resemble anything that
motorola was doing with its original
design lineage which makes sense because
of course the company has been acquired
by google and they want to change the
look that's fine but it is sad because
normally or maybe not normally but
sometimes when a company gets acquired
and it changes its hardware design
aesthetic sometimes it's a good thing
because what they were doing before
wasn't working it didn't look good it
was lame and maybe I'm maybe I'm alone
here but Motorola was making stellar
hardware I think oh yeah I love that
Kevlar on the back of the razor i love
the look of the razor i even love the
bulge on the droid the initial droid
razr so like i love the idea of the max
phones like absolutely every phone
should have a max edition and dr. she
will formally later agreed yeah um but
the other part that I wanted to make or
the other point that I wanted to make
was that part of the reason that this
phone is going to be a victim of its own
hype is the media ice practically
because we've been spreading these
rumors or we haven't been but we've been
regurgitating rumors for you can say I
Taylor where the problem sorry yeah we
are the problem well no it's the truth
we've been regurgitating rumors since
December and they were pointing to this
super phone not necessarily in
specification but a super form that you
can customize you can choose different
processors and and storage and RAM and
and plug and play with your own choice
of specifications yeah and that's that's
not the first time that that's actually
happened this has been done before and
it crashed and burned before really I
ever got off the ground I can't remember
the name of the company but they offered
the service where it was like nine
hundred dollars you can make your own
phone right in the prison the reason
that fails that model fails it works in
computers nine hundred dollars well the
reason it fills not only in price for
consumers but in costs for manufacturing
there is no way to mass-produce these
customized phones because components in
a phone that's small enough to fit in
your pocket aren't just plug and play
you can't just plug it in there they're
soldered and built into the motherboard
of the phone which is smaller than a
credit card right so it's not like it's
not feasible yeah at this point it may
be in the future but that's an idea that
has not yet reached its feasibility
point yes you know when a processor is
like a micro SD card slot or something
right micro SD card right right but the
thing is that was all wishful tanabe
cool nobody ever really heard yeah this
is why feminine mystique nobody ever
really heard a reputable leak that that
was going to be the case that was this
kind of like we're all spit balling like
wouldn't it be cool if this meant
customization and you know we're getting
from right convertible covers what it
came it all came from a Google+ post
from Guy Kawasaki I was really
everything came from he said what if you
could choose like the hardware of your
own phone or something like that and
people just blew way out of proportion
yeah because guy if you don't know guy
guy works for for motorola making them
making them more visible in addition to
you know just being like the biggest
force on the internet ever he is awesome
I mean I once in person I met him once
in person as well where'd you meet him
too I met a bit i think it was mix of
seven mix await mm-hmm microsoft
developer conference out in Vegas I
almost shook his hand and by almost i
mean he was like 300 people away from me
but I was I had my arm extended and I
think he saw me but you know what Joe I
wish you were closer i would take that
guy's hand i wish he hasn't been around
and when I met him because as listeners
longtime listeners know i sat next to
guy guy was acting for an entire dinner
and didn't know who he was until 55
minutes into the dinner I did next time
I mean directly next to him is who I'm
such an outsize nub I set straight
across from the US nokia president we
SAT across the table from for about two
hours and didn't even realize until he
got up i'm like oh wait a minute i know
this guy wait a minute i mean i was
talking to him the whole time and
everything and I'm like wait a minute
it's so funny it's funny because as much
as I as I love talking to people
sometimes I'm still so much better with
devices than with people they're people
I used to be great with people and now I
can't remember a name I shake and by the
time we're done shaking I'm like what's
your name again right like three seconds
and I forget the name it's the same
thing you know what we'd like to have a
pet we're gonna remember you we're gonna
have a pocket now workshop we're all
gonna get together and we're gonna learn
we're gonna relearn dealing it people in
people interaction it's gonna be fun
your name is Taylor that's kind of like
tailor-made for golf so I'm gonna
remember you now see it's never gets a
mnemonic devices happening in your head
that's not you know work let's talk
about google play edition phones for a
second shall we this is something that
Taylor Martin was asking me about when
you were off the air Joe and I was like
shut up I'll tell you on the air so I'm
gonna talk about it stupid tailor made a
great piece called a great video called
five reasons to turn your HTC One into a
Google Play edition and of course the
google play edition HTC one being an HTC
one with no sense skin on it just
running stock Android and that's a great
video and I was about to do it I was
actually about to try and do it with my
extended loan HTC one here from sprint
but instead what happened was on my
doorstep came a google play edition HTC
one so thanks also a SAT HTC yeah I I'm
going to be unboxing that later today
obviously it's not going to have many
surprises in it but I think it deserves
an unboxing just because not a lot of
people have seen it unboxed so it is
time to do that and I'm very much
looking forward to it because I guys
haven't been on stock Android in my hand
like in a non tablet device
since i broke my galaxy nexus on the
boat last summer yeah so I'm very much
looking forward to to playing with that
and said that I would have sent my nexus
4 to you because I'm so charitable thank
you i do appreciate that with anything
with it without LTE is i turn my nose up
at as though it were asparagus example i
give these vegetables with edge devices
yeah cuz you're yeah well you're the new
guy apparently i'm the verizon guy yeah
chose the recent guy in utah anyway but
the point is the watch the video if you
haven't already if you have an HTC One
and you want to make it a google play
edition tales a video for that I mean
yeah how easy is it it's very easy and
I'll tell you out I'll tell you two
videos right Taylor you've got the fire
right five reasons why you want to do
this and then you've got the here's how
you do it in 10 minutes video right yes
and today I'll be shooting another video
on the subject the final video element
yeah which is one which is what how to
return to sense yep the other way we're
doing yes um I will say that flashing
the google play edition software on your
HTC One unlocking the bootloader routing
installing a DB and everything was
easier than writing the script for the
five reasons why to do it but that was
really tough because I've explained it
in an editorial there are a lot of
things about stock software that's just
not it's not meant for some devices
these days because these devices as I
said long ago when these were announced
that the HTC one in the galaxy s4 will
built around since and TouchWiz yeah
they're not built around stock Android
so they're missing a lot of features
unlike your nexus 4 which comes really
without compromise in terms of your
experience that's that's setting aside
your your low storage and no LTE and
stuff like that but yeah now you lose
infrared you lose all sorts of things if
it comes from if you do it yourself now
the ones that come from the google play
store as Google Play editions are built
with the currently like the manufacturer
has done a custom kernel for them so
that you still get beats on the HTC One
for example yeah I saw it beats online
aao really yeah they used the HTC
release to colonel yeah otherwise
otherwise it wouldn't be possible so
it's
same exact thing oh well then I'm wrong
yeah hmm it's not the first time yeah no
it's not no it's definitely not yeah I
don't know mr. I get into kernel level
stuff I I you know I am I'm but alone or
a lowly lieutenant yeah colonel yeah but
let's move on before I before I talk
about more things I don't know about the
HTC topic has not been exhausted yet I
want to talk about the HTC desire 200
very briefly did you guys look at this
cute little thing I just did oh my gosh
it is like a tiny little itty bitty HTC
One X X well it's it's the HTC One Cup
yeah it's the HTC vir like it it's cute
so it is 1x because it has the old
button configuration and it's
polycarbonate hold it hold up there
chief it's the 1x if the 1x is eyebrow
was a and age from the HTC One because
it's got those machined holes up top
above its racing knife back so wait a
second hold a sec wait if it if it's
polycarbonate around back like the 1x
then why does Tony say in his news piece
about this it the back features an
interesting texture Allah samsung galaxy
s4 and s4 mini because it doesn't look
like hyper glaze to me I don't get what
the what are you saying there I think
the texture it looks dotted oh the like
DeVoe aesthetically okay I can see that
now that I'm looking at it you look real
close so you've got to look real close
to see that okay yeah so if you guys
haven't been out to the article uh it
published on July fourth of July yeah so
HTC desire 200 yeah click the link if
you're listening to this on youtube this
should be a reminder that you should
click the description because we got
time codes and all that kind of stuff
yeah and this is very low-end left with
the spec yeah so we got hurts wonder
you're single core processor 512
megabytes of RAM 3.5 inch screen and
Android Ice Cream Sandwich oh shoot
there since 402
android for not oh that's so old now
that's like yeah it was well not a point
to two versions ago well not how long
ago did it come out yeah ICS came out
what december 2011 hmm yeah but that was
almost january of 2012 i like the way
you think joe white stands is still a
year and a half old yeah yeah yeah
nothing should ship with sulfur that's
more than like three months old okay so
I'll just think about what this is what
the desire right look at the spec sheet
you're not gonna throw jelly bean on top
of that right project butter you know
yeah jelly bean 4.1 I think that might
my two pretty good on it yes or point2
rocking a better makes a big difference
yes especially on phones that are kind
of under hold up hold up now you stop it
we're not gonna like we're not going to
continue projecting this party line
nonsense that project butter is a
panacea for all of androids problems
because i was using my nexus 7 last
night and I was like dude hashtagging
some Instagram ish or whatever and we're
going to talk about Instagram again in a
second and I was waiting for that thing
so many times I am so compared of the
lag that don't present on jelly bean
don't lump in the Tegra 3 don't even do
that young good point that's a
difference of jelly bean is running on
that nexus 7 because of the type of
processor or because it's what I'm
running for that two dots are two I dude
right yeah that's what I'm saying throat
jelly bean 4.1 on that side but but come
on right like jelly bean for tomorrow's
introduced project what are you exactly
all right and it's funny cuz i will
gladly take the the role of ignoramus
here because a customer doesn't give a
crap what version of whatever is running
is like I want this to be smooth as
anything oh wait it runs jelly bean oh I
heard thats way smoother they take it
home they're waiting 14 seconds for a
friggin app to like switch over and
maybe that's an exaggeration would've
felt a 14-second so it's like why can't
we just have jelly beans and eat them
too is my question the problem is Oh
Android before jelly bean wasn't better
in performance so why would jelly bean
not be bad
because it is better it's meant to be
better I don't know it doesn't nothing
about what you've said makes sense no
because ice cream sandwich on my galaxy
nexus ran quite well for a while let me
clarify this for you ok Michael disease
while you're on the show because you're
more cores more better all right yes
don't go leave ice cream sandwich was
nice and pretty and then jellybean 4.1
came out and it took nice and pretty and
made it nice and smooth and then
especially when we're talking about some
of the lower end devices like the Nexus
7 there's another flavor of jelly bean
and it's that earwax flavor one that
comes from Bernie bots and it's terribly
so not every jelly bean tastes good and
that's the case with the nexus 7 when
you go back down to 4.1 on the Nexus 7
which I know not a normal person's gonna
do right but they still have that rom
sitting out there so you can still do it
and it's real easy it's it's fast and
buttery again it's the 4.2 version of
jelly bean that made the nexus 7 slow
down so that's why I'm wondering we have
lower end specs on this device the
desire 200 I'm wondering why couldn't we
get the advantage of jelly bean you know
the project butter and just put 4.1 on
it rather than the the Bernie bots your
wife's flavor 4.2 you know it's real
jelly bean cuz that would work i mean i
would be much more willing to overlook
an older android version if it ran very
smoothly and of course we have no idea
how well it things run on the desire 200
we don't have one this is all league
stuff well but you know what it's funny
this is one of the first low-end devices
that I've seen in a while that I
actually wants to try out like it's cool
it looks it looks a little Frankenstein
II I'm not saying that thing is pretty
it's kind of pretty from the back but
then he's like it's kind of a butterface
right needs a little bit of a butterface
yeah it's a butterface yeah alright so
let's just shift gears just a little bit
here please android is still doing this
and I want to know before I bias you
with my opinion what do you guys think
about this Apple is doing something
entirely different with their quote
unquote low-end devices which means you
want a
Oh end Apple you get a 4s or maybe not
for right you could eat last year's
phone exactly and it's nice because it
runs the current version of the OS with
you know a few features that aren't
there which I wrote an article about not
long ago shameless plug for that but
here you've got HTC now has to worry
about a flagship phone and a low-end
phone so they're kind of splitting their
attention wise Android doing that is it
a good thing why or why not go just use
old devices as the mid-range and low-end
phones okay so maybe that's a superior
business model I think that would be a
much more boring world because i love
what love covering multiple devices
because we need those variations in
hardware because it is just a sea of
slabs I've said it before but taking any
normal person into a cell phone for if
you haven't done this listeners fellow
pocket now Ian's whatever take someone
normal with you into a cell phone store
and watch their reaction to this like
normal to this well it's true to the sea
of like slabs and especially if it's an
older person if you can bring your
parent and where it's like wow yeah
these all look the same is what I've
gotten is time and time again it's like
I don't know what's the difference they
all look they all look alike to me I
like the blue one right yeah that one's
free right so it's free oh and that
one's free well I like the blue one
anyway no you don't it's got a 500
megahertz processor in it and we have a
gig around keep our know about people
person after person and they're doing
this you know Samsung is doing this
people are buying the galaxy s3 in in
large numbers in my social circles right
now because if people's upgrades are
coming up its the summer time for
whatever and they're like I'm gonna get
that galaxy s3 cuz it's 30 bucks inside
the galaxy s4 is 150 bucks it's like wow
okay I mean I wouldn't recommend that
but all right go for it you know so the
week before the galaxy s4 was released
for tmobile my friend down the street
got his wife a galaxy s2 and he got the
galaxy s3 and got them at a really good
deal because well the forest coming out
next week so you gotta knock 50 bucks
off each one of them of course oh and
they're happy with them recognize the
reality yeah I you merican they need
them to do I should qualify that it's
not that I don't recommend it because I
actually said quite the office
my s4 vers s3 comparison but it still I
don't know I it's just I I never want to
advocate somebody buying a generational
technology because it's because of the
pace this industry moves in yeah but
Sojo you know I think the diversity of
the Android space speaks in this regard
as well because even though you're right
it's not as common in the Android space
because it is so much more busy there is
a manufacturer that's that's that's
doing that as a manufacturer that's
doing both you know Samsung is doing
that with its premium galaxy s tough but
just in case you're the type that needs
different hardware here's 40 other
galaxies branded devices yeah and this
one's waterproof right and that one was
I really still like that galaxy s4
active i will say that and this one
takes zoom pictures and this one and
this one and they're nothing alike but
we're gonna call them the same things
and they're all the same family yeah
those were just adopted I feel like I
feel like maybe where we're going
somewhere we've been before shall we
move on let's do I just wanted to cover
that while we're looking at know there's
a solid sire I loved request i would not
complaining about your question i'm just
just being mindful about your your heart
outage I like the Taylor and I are the
only ones who never have heart outs oh I
don't know it out today what are you
talking about I had one at 1101 I just
didn't take it yeah we appreciate that
hey Taylor hey I'm gonna tell you a
story one time I know we're just going
airliner I was before you start using uh
no I'm just come for you start yeah I
feel like this entire podcast so far
I've played the part of ollie I really
have like Mohammed I know Polly from
family guy we were talking about this oh
that's right it's gon rain
television ass on this thanks for bad
yeah the entire time I'm like thanks
Holly Holly will you likes popcorn and
butter yeah time I just realized it's
nice it's good well I was on the
Instagram recently and I was scrolling
through the feed and I came across a
like a picture of a phone or something
like that and this happens cuz I follow
other outlets who on Instagram blah blah
blah blah blah but this one was from was
from Taylor and you know what's funny i
didn't even put her together because my
brain was in like speeding the feeds
kind of mode where I wasn't really
critically thinking I was just watching
stuff go by and I'm like oh that's
pretty but I was like oh so you were in
the John that was I was not I was not
sir oh my brain may have been in the loo
but I was not know it's your picture of
a phone i didn't whatever it was i don't
i don't care what it was it was same
drops so my car your lunch it was also
your life it was something week no no it
was it was actually cool and I was like
oh Taylor never posting by the school
and I didn't even think about your like
vendetta against Instagram and so when
you wrote a piece that said why why I
might come back to Instagram I it
suddenly clicked I was like oh right and
then I looked up your profile and I
didn't realize Taylor that you are a
you're not just someone who said no to
Instagram and never went on you're
someone who spent a lot of time on
Instagram and then quit yeah oh yeah I
spent every day I'd share a picture
almost every day or two or ten so this
this is to me like um now many will
disagree with me this is to me like the
story of the the straight-a student
who's a good who's a good boy and then
he like falls in with the bad crowd
starts getting def starts getting happy
with the guy who had absolutely started
hanging with the good crowd and I don't
think I don't think that's right I don't
submit a story i'm sooo many where's the
fancy hat yeah he's right exactly
exactly changes schools and gets a hat
what's the deal with that yeah there
there are no pictures of me and I have I
don't think on Instagram so there might
be one or two but here's my question why
might you return to Instagram after all
this time despite the fact that it makes
a fun headline and also yeah you thank
you by the way for sharing my image
in your title and you're dead you're
welcome um no I quit let me start by why
I quit I quit at the same time everybody
was quitting because the new terms in
addition so we're selling your your
pictures to add companies or for ads or
whatever it was I can't remember exactly
exactly what it was but they were saying
hey we're updating our Terms and
Conditions and at the very end of it it
was revealed that nothing really changed
all that much they were doing exactly
what they were before and everybody
freaked out over because they made it i
guess a little more transparent the
terms and conditions whatever i didn't
care about that i really don't care if
somebody sells my image for advertising
by all means i think that just makes it
spreads my reach a little bit if
somebody recognizes me cool hey whatever
um but i had this epiphany one day I
woke up like everybody was jumping ship
and I'm like why would they be jump
jumping ship I would they quit Instagram
if they loved it so much over something
small like this so it hit me I'm like
I've been talking about camera quality
just just hounding it for three years
now cameras on phones suck these suck
these suck there's at least two that are
great but the rest suck you know all the
time just talking about how they are
terrible and then I would share every
picture I took to Instagram which
automatically reduces the quality drag
happy it's the lowest common denominator
everybody can see the same crappy
pictures and you don't have to worry
about people who have good camera phones
but yeah that that's a very true point
but the point was I'm sitting here
talking about how she's an apology needs
to be improved and then there i am
sharing these pictures as 6 12 x 6 12
squares with filters and they look like
utter garbage you felt like a hypocrite
yeah i did and i'm like i don't choose
one you had to stop talking about camera
quality or you had to quit instagram
yeah and i was made your choice i'm done
here and i went to find an alternative i
jumped to flickr really quickly and
decided that wasn't i wasn't gonna wear
i'm already asleep yeah yeah i mean the
app looks great and the pictures look
great on flickr but there was just
nobody on flickr and it was boring
slamming and I just went to sharing
everything I wanted to share
be pictured i would share it three times
once to facebook once to Twitter wants
to Google+ and I'm just like oh okay
yeah yeah so I'm actually writing a
little bit about this today I've got an
editorial coming up on do you want a
social lap one social app to rule them
all kind of 10 k a family but let's see
we're gonna look over to their that I
like so it's it's nice to get your
perspective on this and you know
listeners you should click the story to
read Taylor's view on this and what
would have Joe because I think Joe is is
a member of the class that I talked
about before whose is correct me if I'm
wrong if you never been on Instagram
I've looked and ironically i've looked
that the majority of my searches have
all been like hashtag boston for some
reason I don't know those are fun to do
yes but no I don't know that I've ever
posted anything on Instagram I may be
wrong i might have experimented a little
in my youth and just don't remember but
alright man you didn't inhale just say
it forgive us for the youthful
indiscretions but no i've i've been out
to flickr whatever most of my sharing
i'm not a big photo sharing guy but most
of what i do i do on google+ just
because of all the cool stuff that they
they do with your images and the
automatic backup and automatic upload
and blah blah blah and now with the you
know all the super awesome filters that
they announced at Google i/o that make
your crappy pictures which I'm a
programmer guys I'm not a photographer I
don't know what looks pretty except my
wife oh she's pretty but yeah I just I
can't tell I honestly cannot tell a good
picture from a crappy-looking picture so
all this stuff that that mr. Casper Tex
talking about over there okay you are at
sea let's go no and the reason i ask us
is because it's not just you know
because i love Instagram and whatever
but instagram is a was a powerful force
before and then facebook acquired it for
a million dollars as everybody knows and
we're starting to see some of the
modifications that they're making to it
and you know by and large I think it's a
success story so far
the gos discussion is another one
entirely but but if the feature editions
and the usability improvements are so
subtle at the moment they're so but
they're so nice and it was like
refinements there's been a lot of
improvement since I left and came back
exactly and I think it's a success story
in it is so far in terms of that and I
think it's going to become more relevant
as time goes on which is why we keep
talking about it it's not just because
i'm a fanboy and i want to talk about
this thing well i think it's important
so why did i come back though yeah that
it's hard to explain well there were two
reasons there was one that was kind of
the major reason I haven't been using
vine a lot but I really like it and I
like how much penetration has gotten in
such a short time and how engaging it is
i really like sharing short little video
snippets it's great and some people have
been trying to do it for 200 years now
and nobody's plain able to successfully
do that until vine and I was I didn't
share a lot to buy him but I would
scroll through and watch stuff because
there are a lot of funny vines out there
and then Instagram obviously added their
video component and the problem with
vine is i'd share a couple things and
i'd get like one like and you know i
spent most of my time looking not
sharing and with instagram there are
already 150 million monthly active users
that are already there sharing videos it
was just kind of like an organic
overnight thing that happened mm-hm and
i'm sitting here thinking i already use
three social apps twitter google+ and
facebook and i don't want don't know
worth yeah yeah well at least we're
people are gonna be thinking that way
going forward well at least a fourth or
a fifth if i go back to Instagram then
i'm looking at five apps vine Instagram
Twitter Google+ and Facebook and that's
like my numbing and you know how social
overkill at that point yeah so I hopped
back on Instagram for a minute and I'm
like you know what there's just so much
going on here I'm missing out because
there's just a lot that my friends are
sharing to Instagram that I just don't
see and you know I'm a very social guy
at least online and yeah
and I was like you know what this isn't
so bad I'm gonna I'm gonna rethink this
and then I went out that night that same
night I went out and I was at a bar and
basically the short story is I helped
crash a bachelor party yeah okay we
didn't really crash it we just hung out
with the the bridesmaids and the
bride-to-be and they were taking
pictures and they're like yeah you guys
are all so yeah and they took pictures
and they're like let's tag you on
Instagram I'm like I don't use Instagram
and every single one of them just
stopped and looked at me like I just
shot somebody in the face you're like
what like um sorry don't mean to be
didn't know what you do it did they know
that you were a tech blogger they didn't
at the time they did by the time I left
okay um I'm Taylor and I'm on the
Internet oh yeah only from the
conversation it does because everyone
carries a phone that's why everyone
carries a phone but also they asked me
for my number and I pull out like a
phone in the oak and I put it back in my
pocket and pull out the right with other
phones like hey there just like wait a
minute what what just happened you do
know your drug dealer and yeah depends
job so they asked me that they're like
why don't you use Instagram and I tried
to explain it and their eyes glossed
over and they went back to the bar and
got some more drinks and I'm like
whatever so I went back to the same bar
a couple nights later I was hanging out
with my friends and the exact same thing
happened without a bachelor party yeah
we're talking to a bunch of people they
took a picture they're like hey let's
tag you an Instagram I'm like I don't
use Instagram right and they are you and
they're just outside floor right right
yeah it's like mean girls they just look
at you like well it's like what happened
with my space and then it's worth it
could happen with Facebook and it's like
what's happening what's happened with
Twitter and yeah yeah it's a shallow
downs no but you wanted a conversation
well a part of the conversation and
actually it helps meet people as stupid
as it sounds and the the comparison I
made is you can't tag someone on
facebook if you share a picture with a
stranger you can't say I'm here with
this person that I just met unless you
friend them first totally oh and on
Twitter you're not gonna just be like
hey I'm at this bar with this person I
just met a you're not gonna
that no so I unwittingly proved it
provided back up to your point here
yesterday my girlfriend and I were on
one of the Boston Harbor Islands which
has a lot of abandoned world war two
infrastructure and we were in this like
a looked old case mate with peeling
paint and crumbling concrete and it was
not and a lot of people had done rafidi
on the wall and my girlfriend was just
enamored with this one piece of graffiti
word so it's like an angel walked on
this island an angel named morgan
freeman and so my girlfriend like
cracking up she insists that I take a
photo of this thing I'm like whatever
this isn't that funny to me but ok I'll
take a photo and I'm going through
photos that are hashtag boston harbor
islands last night on instagram someone
had taken the exact same photo and
uploaded it so i started a conversation
was like oh hey i took this photo to and
we just like i made a friend out of a
stranger who had been on the same like
island as i had that same day which
would not have been possible on facebook
you're absolutely right yeah well the
same day to the same like four hours
apart yeah that's creepy isn't it guys
so it it instagram forces your social
life into the meat space it does that is
exactly what it does uh and first use of
meats based on the past it's a credit
limit in thirds thank you had i had to
throw it in there but yeah it does and i
want to say that i haven't gotten memoir
no I would say gobbledygook and that
one's already ticked off just now uh you
got fixed okay we can say razzamatazz
you guys want to talk awful Discovery
Channel shows hey oh let's wrap it up on
Instagram oh yeah yeah the funny thing
was like I think the first comment that
I got on that not on the site but on
some social channel somebody said this
is a media or a tech site not a not your
personal diary or something okay yeah
okay thanks I love everyone felt kind of
shallow but about it because I am I'm
succumbing to peer pressure basically
right but that's okay because sometimes
that's important yeah and everybody's
doing it right everybody cool now so
yeah there's a larger feel sort of a
question about about the popularity of
platforms and about how that plays into
I mean that's the thing and
we're going to get a ton of haida on the
comments on this because I feel like
Instagram stories are the ones most
likely they're kind of like wireless
charging stories where it's like no
matter how cool the wireless charger is
there will always be 50,000 people who
are like what's the point just plug it
in with the wire and it's like shut up
just leave shut it's not ours just in
short they're wrong yeah they'd right
right exactly I'm not really why wrong
that hey dr. bug it in I'm not saying
along to hit Instagram if you hate
Instagram is for a good reason that's
fine if you hate Instagram just because
it's like no I don't know i don't like
socialization okay fine then stop
leaving comments anyway go back to your
little hermit right oh and it's your AM
radio and see that's nice seton in the
final that's maybe and funny i'm not
trying to offend ham radio people of
course the final point is one that that
hi May made he said having separate apps
for photo sharing and video sharing is
ridiculous and it really is it's a solid
point yeah so that that's what it comes
down to at the very end it's it's about
having video sharing and and photo
sharing in the same app because that
obviously just makes sense if you can
share video vine please just throw
pictures in there too like what yes you
know I'm and maybe they whatever we'll
see whatever so that's the the end of
that well good well I'll elaborate it on
it on a little more in my post editorial
with coming post good that's the end
until internet the end until later on
this afternoon story my life i'm like
i'm going to bed twitter and like and
then four hours later you're still there
i know i was there any air later alright
so every night I want to know about I
want to know about something I want to
know about science and it radio waves
and things that do not relate to to
social media for the moment I want to
know from our friend Joe Levi the
android guy about a question presented
to us by King I believe in the podcast
email several weeks back in the headline
basically verbatim reproduces the email
why is Wi-Fi so much worse on
smartphones than on laptops and
computers I love this question because I
posed a question similar question to Joe
years ago a year ago about where I was
like hey Joe my wife is sucking on my
phone why is that I don't have enough GP
that must be it yeah is that right do I
need to get more image these or what
thank you that's exactly it is you gotta
go down further an alphabet for your
Wi-Fi literacy Wi-Fi eight feet it's
good just lost everyone from Taylor's
home state uh oh so they don't know what
Wi-Fi is so Joe keep talking Joe breaks
it down succinctly and into a couple
different categories like output power
antenna size and number of antennas but
before we get the kind of 10,000 foot
view on that from Joe I want to ask you
guys do you do you also notice this that
Wi-Fi performance on smartphones is
significantly less impressive than on
larger devices absolutely and there is a
smartphone or not a smartphone a
software component to that as well where
Wi-Fi might title off if your screen
goes off or something to that extent
yeah there's that but they're talking
about that aspect in the article that
you are absolutely right and in android
for dot 3 the the leaked rom that was
out there somewhere somebody found that
there is a software setting in Wi-Fi
settings in the advanced menu that
allows you to absolutely keep Wi-Fi on
twenty-four/seven cool so there is that
but that go ahead around in a lot of a
lot of android builds and i don't know
if it's like an AOSP thing or whatnot
but you can and have been able to unless
you're really i'm never sleep yeah you
just tell it never turn off yeah but
this one it was like it has changed I
don't know if a functionality changed
but it says always on or something like
that I don't know hmm I don't know if
it's any different but that better
there's some investigation I'm wondering
if it isn't just never sleep reworded to
be more friendly and understandable it
might be no no no so yes a very the
biggest thing on and I kind of put this
more towards the bottom of the article
because honestly it's the most boring of
them all but you know we talking about
all kinds of stuff in the podcast the
biggest thing is your frequencies and
that gets the question that you are
asking Michael on Wi-Fi operates in both
2.4 gigahertz
and five gigahertz and that is you know
a lot of people think that that's just
one thing but it's it's an entire
spectrum and to get really super geeky
and try and and tone it down to the
level that I don't know one actor could
understand wow so you've got and I don't
have the numbers right in front of me
but you've got you've got a bunch of
different frequencies in both two point
four and five gigahertz those are just
kind of the reference marks that we used
to talk about them and you need to look
at them as as if they're a highway you
know you've got your road that's in
front of your house and it has two lanes
you got the the road the feeder street
that gets you from you know your
neighborhood out to the highway that's
maybe four streets and then you got the
highway that's 10 or 10 Street lanes go
back replace all those streets with
lanes yeah that's one that's ten lanes
wide well the more lanes you have the
the faster the traffic can flow and the
more stuff can get through and that's
both throughput and data rate blah blah
blah blah blah the problem you run into
with when they're saying is that if I
have more taps I can get more appears
i'm looking for a see more butts and in
your house if if you were trying to get
the same amount of people that go on the
freeway down the side streets like
there's a wreck on the freeway for
example and they all have to be diverted
off onto the side streets it's going to
be very slow and very clogged up because
there's so many people there well yeah
it right it's the same bandwidth the
thing as we talk about each other I mean
so that that's what's happening here
with Wi-Fi 2.4 gigahertz is the Wild
West it's where everybody is on
keyboards and mice use it bluetooth uses
it bluetooth keyboards and mice use it
bluetooth headsets Wi-Fi smart phones
laptops tablets everybody uses 2.4 and
very few people use 5 gigahertz
right now still and it's funny cuz five
gigahertz isn't all that new I mean it's
been around for years I know in fact 802
11 a the very first Wi-Fi to come out
and somebody's gonna correct that in the
comments but for this topic for this
conversation well it's the first one for
this type of the argument yes that was
five gigahertz when businesses were
using that primarily it was it was
faster than the NATO 211 be or it could
be faster than 802 11 be and practices
in turn out to be 802 11 B was 2.4
gigahertz and it was slow and the
difficulty you had There was at work you
couldn't use your home equipment and at
home you couldn't use your work
equipment and it was a pain in the neck
and they didn't have these dual function
cards at least not that much way back
then I worked at an ad agency that had a
we have three commas are as our client
and we did a whole educational thing on
why you couldn't use one in one place
and one in the other and then they
pushed a rev that made it possible and
kind of negated the whole campaign so it
was awesome but that's that's the
biggest deal is it's so noisy there's so
much traffic going on there that for
your stuff to get through you have to
bump up the power so that your signal is
louder than everybody else's signal
another you're able to do that would
better with a device that actually has
more power yeah so that's called the
sound floor and if you look at you can
get noise floor simple stuff yeah the
noise floor you can get all kinds of
cool apps that show you everybody else
out there and just draw a line across
where everyone else is and look where
your signal is yeah The Closer your
signal is to that noise floor the slower
thing is going to be the more spot of
your connection is going to be and that
gets to your next point which was the
power output of your smartphones and
even tablets is a lot lower than it is
on laptops and especially desktops that
are connecting via Wi-Fi
so the the output the volume if you will
the signal strength coming out of those
smaller devices is a lot closer to that
noise floor then if you were on a laptop
or a desktop and by virtue of the fact
that your laptop or desktop is just
physically larger with more power
available whether it's from a wall or
from a larger battery right a large
battery that gets you more power so you
can you're not as battery constrained
they usually also have larger antennas
and more antennas which is going to a
lot of questions yeah yeah a lot of
people don't equate antennas to power
but you can go back to ham radio because
it's an excellent example you can with
the right antenna transmit a signal
entirely around the world on half a watt
of power mm-hmm it's all about the right
antenna and matching that to what you're
trying to do of course that's different
frequencies and we're talking about here
so nobody say well why can't I get Wi-Fi
across the street it's no it's it's
different but the antenna is vitally
important and they're just antennas are
kind of second thoughts when you're
trying to cram them inside of a
smartphone it's big space in there in
you know they're vanishing from the
public consciousness as well because we
haven't seen physical antennas on
smartphones or on phones period in but
about six years probably yeah you
remember the extendable dipoles that
used to pull out and lock into place and
it's like a my antennas up I'd see
people talking on the phone like I can't
hear you I'm like you gotta extend your
antenna bro and come on it's 2004 I have
a sticker on the inside that supposed to
be a solid a coaster is yes very
prevalent in Virginia Beach I had way
too much fun with the optimus g pro the
korean version with the foot long
antenna on it oh that's right yeah I
neglected to mention the the TV tuner
antenna yeah um no I just woke up and
I'd walk around and have the tenant
extended and then you could swivel it
around and stuff so swiveling it around
and talking yeah like what are you doing
I'm like I'm trying to get signal what
is that let me close out the Wi-Fi
conversation Jojo just by ass
confer a for a one-minute rundown on
what makes it 02 11ac there are new our
new friend so much better the biggest
deal there in addition to the fact that
you know it's just the next progression
it's got better better protocols they've
learned lessons and made improvements
with the next version so it's just going
to be better all around but the biggest
thing is 802 11 AC is going to be pushed
almost exclusively in the 5 gigahertz
spectrum so you're going to have a lot
less traffic there to begin with it's
faster it's got better better collision
correction error correction all that fun
stuff so you're going to have better
speed you're going to have a less noisy
environment in which to talk and
ultimately it's just going to be an
awful lot better all-around awesome
thank you very much for the for closing
out our android discussion on a
scientific note Joe leave had this is
why I wish you rather podcast Morris you
know it's all right it's all what you
know it's difficult it's difficult
because I try and run this stuff
sometimes but you know they just didn't
teach me as much an actor school so I
guess my science officer listen I want
to go from talking about Android to
talking about a different platform is
everybody excited about that no
absolutely I knew I knew the negator
would come out for them hey black 10
we've had some interesting news come out
of blackberry recently some sad news
they are not making as much money as
they should be they are not shipping as
many BlackBerry 10 devices as they
should be and so on and it's been a just
a big old cloud of food / blackberry
recently and Taylor Martin wrote a piece
I know you're all surprised ask a human
question thank you what does blackberry
stand a chance anymore Taylor's position
no yeah well I wrote this editorial not
focusing on the business side because
there are so many different variables
there that that I really don't care
about and most other people don't either
sure I don't care about what revenue
blackberry is is posting I don't care
what kind of profit they're making or
losses they're posting rather
I don't care about any of that because
that doesn't matter the company is big
enough to where they can pull out of
this if they do the right thing right
that they can that is a fact but uh no I
was a big huge blackberry fan for the
better part of six years on use them day
in a day out i use probably over 30
different blackberries and i love them i
had so many of them and i used them and
I in my spare time I made themes I was
as much about Android today as I was
yeah we nobody we know what you're
saying there yeah yeah whatever I don't
know what I don't know the words that
are coming out of my mouth it works are
hard yeah there we go words and things
um what do you even low on the Internet
Taylor yeah right I've gotten so many
comments I can do your job better bleats
always fun please show me good uh so I
finally moved away from blackberry long
after the iphone came around my first
android phone was the HTC that what was
it daddy doesn't matter well I'm just
saying like that's when I really started
to get away from blackberry was the the
sprint um hero the HTC hero she's a hero
oh yeah so I went to that and from there
it was like 30 different android phones
and I kind of slowly started getting out
of blackberry but I always loved them us
all we wanted them to to come back and
really just wow me and that's what I was
hoping for from blackberry 10 as well as
pretty much every single other every
single person that switched and did the
same exact thing I did who reluctantly
got rid of their blackberry and I was
really looking forward to it and then
when the q10 and z10 were announced I
was like f ah it's not that great i
really don't care doesn't really move me
and then people started getting their
cute ins and i got a little bit of
nostalgia and i had to try it and i did
and I've been using it for a couple
weeks off and on not really hard or
because there's not really a lot to do
with it and and the point of them the
point is they really haven't done much
of anything it's been
two years since their last major major
update right so from book from
blackberry 7 to blackberry 10 what was
wait what's your question like two years
from the last major update what from six
to seven no from seven to ten one that
close to two years oh I see what you
mean yeah yeah yeah I mean it was it was
a long time and I'm thinking they have
to have something great up their sleeve
they have to be doing something awesome
and this entire time all they really did
was play catch-up and they didn't do it
in a really compelling fashion they're
just kind of like we're gonna throw this
together and hope this works and we got
to get something out there right now to
stay relevant and let's hope that it at
work I could totally understand that if
it took them six months or a year even
but the fact that they delete delayed it
a year and still really didn't bring
anything forward I mean they brought
forward other people's software
Schelotto camera software um I don't
know what to say it's just I've used it
and it's not blackberry route the
blackberry I knew it's not the
blackberry I loved the one thing I did
love was the universal inbox I could get
notifications for everything in one
place and it's different from a
notification shade because when you read
it it's still there totally they've got
a chronological order of everything that
ever happens on your phone well you can
say to that in blackberry 10 they they
pour it in 210 yeah can but hub is not
the universal inbox it's not and what
way is not the same thing it is it just
thing no it's exactly the same thing
except that it sucks to manage multiple
messages right now they need to update
that and they need to up its performance
because it's a little sluggish but
otherwise it is the universal inbox no
it's not the same you hit T to go to the
top of yet be to go to the bottom one
more do you want um into Markel is red
no agreed mark all as read needs to be
there but or so before we get to I was
just pulling your chain about that a
little bit but listen blackberry hub I
like a lot is probably my favorite part
of lack pretend now I spoke with with
blackberry last week and for the entire
come I spoke with yeah I did hey where's
that where's the interview Michael
so here's the thing here's the progress
okay so i want to tell you who I spoke
with first I spoke with Dom Lindsay it
was the VP of the blackberry user
experience and Gary Clausen the
principal architect and instantly the
guy who basically brought BBM into being
almost a decade ago so I talked to some
great great guys in this was facility
was facilitated by BlackBerry's
excellent PR team and man I had a great
time and we spoke for about 45 minutes
about how they did build blackberry 10
and particularly about the contributions
the astonishing tribe made to the effort
that was kind of the thrust of the whole
saying blackberry if you know remember
listeners blackberry bought a company
called the astonishing tribe which did
some amazing work in the UI for android
for made principally for Android but but
what for a lot of different platforms um
yeah but made most of the stuff that's
on their site right now is was was what
they did for Android yeah but there was
a like a infographic yay yeah about
about all the stuff they've done and
they had like we lost Joe again all
right all right well keep talking he'll
come back so the astonishing tribe was
was basically an amazing design house
and blackberry rim that at the time
bought them and when they integrated
them you know there was a lot of these
doom and gloom stories as tend to happen
when mergers happen or it's like the
astonishing tribe just lost all these
people because of the merger and is
there any brain power left and so I was
coming into this interview kind of
asking like is that true I mean did the
astonishing tribe visit a shell of its
former self like what's up and of course
predictably the answer the answer from
blackberry regardless of what ever the
truth actually is was always going to be
no it's like things are fine but I
didn't get the sense that i was getting
spend i didn't get the sense that I was
being just told what I wanted to hear
did the impression that I got was that
not only were there are a lot of people
in that the former astonishing tribe
office so I don't remember what they
call the the office so whatever they
call the office they're moving they're
hiring they're they're expanding that
office they're not collapsing it and
they're moving Gary klaassen is moving
over there he's moving like to an
entirely different countries uprooting
his entire family to like head the
effort over there and
so I get the sense that refining the
blackberry 10 UI is of crucial
importance to bladder it's not an ass of
crucial importance to pretty much the
entire thing the whole project right it
is but because it's not that great right
but you know what used to happen with
blackberry when they were called rim is
that this very obvious truth would
surface and everyone inside the company
would be like no it's fine there's
nothing to fix so they're much more
self-aware now I think that they are
they have to be fully con today of
course they have to be they have sales
numbers to back that up now and I'm just
oh you mean say yeah yeah yeah back up
this isn't work back at the yeah so the
point is that I still I I do want to
talk about blackberry itself a little
bit more but I want to say that this
interview was awesome and you're never
going to read it listeners due to a
problem due to a problem that may be
obvious who source ready obvious at this
point that interview interview doesn't
exist I'm not in a written form because
of a user error and it was my user is my
fault I lost I got the recording of the
area so i couldn't i don't understand
how to save files get on my desktop
cheater i want you to leave the country
i want you to go work for blackberry
overseas so what am I when I was in that
high school and college my dream job and
I swear you can ask anyone who knew me
then my dream job my single goal in life
was to be an engineer for blackberry
yeah and I abandoned it Oh Rob I was
like we're probably good thing to do um
ya know but the point that I wanted to
make that I made in this editorial was
that there's just no reason for me even
someone who wants to use blackberry deep
down inside I want to use it again
there's no reason for me to use it and
it's not just the app ecosystem the UI
is not fun or easy to navigate there are
so many inconsistencies and different
things throughout the UI that it's just
kind of like what why is this here why
why why why it needs a fair amount of
refinement yes yeah and and the comment
you get all the time is why don't you
just port some android apps to it
because they don't work that
well they work horribly depending on
what you get they work some some their
their trash yeah and I'll be honest in
my review I only ported I only tried one
or two ported android apps just to see
if they worked right because I hated
being inside them because they're in
there too dot three apps like they look
horrible they feel horrible and it won't
be interesting to me until I can run you
know some some jelly bean apps on
blackberry 10 and see how that works and
thankfully we don't have that much
longer to wait yeah um also I installed
plume i ported blue mover because all
the Twitter clients on Android I mean
blackberry except for maybe black that
one's pretty good but all the other ones
are just kind of like man yeah and I
didn't want to pay for an app on
blackberry that I'd probably only use
for a couple weeks so I poured it bloom
over and an ad took up like half the
screen that wouldn't go away so yeah
there's that there so we will see what
develops a that the I'm sorry we lost
the interview but we're obviously still
actively following what BlackBerry's
doing I don't get a cab but I'm sorry I
had to write another doom and gloom
blackberry article I didn't want to but
I felt that I really needed to because
I'm a long time blackberry fan and I'm
one of the few that's still rooting for
the company and I just I don't see how
using blackberry 10 and moving forward
with what they've got right now will
work I will say this that though I have
enjoyed my time with the q10 and though
I really haven't been able to put it
down and when I do type on it I feel
better made most of that is the keyboard
and the OS although there are some
really infectious things to it like the
swipe up and there's some echoes of
webos I really love and I continue to
love the hub it for me personally I
can't I can't carry it as a DD solo most
that's because of Instagram and pebble
I'll be honest but also that I would
like it to be more refined and
thankfully it looks like despite their
awful numbers so far they're going to
have some time to refine it and see what
I see how it goes Joe do you have any
interest in or feelings about blackberry
before we move on I just have to two
questions first is President Obama still
using a blackberry
mornin he switch to something else I
think he's probably i think you know
that's the problem you know President
Obama switched and then blackberry fell
apart thanks Obama there you go yeah I
think they uh I don't think they I'm not
sure if they let him actually keep his
blackberry I think they had to be late
to the game similar to give him that
awful windows mobile like this journey
yeah with the young prince and I think
the waiters carry around in Canada yeah
good so he doesn't leave it in the
bathroom on Air Force One right right
right but then he's able to do something
else yeah yeah and then the second
question was you know this seems like a
rebirth like I you know like Windows
Mobile to Windows Phone where it's not
really in an iterative improvement it's
it's a rebirth of the platform yeah on
Microsoft is seeing how difficult that
is right now and their numbers are not
all that great I mean they're making
improvements sure but yeah you know with
blackberry doing the same thing I just I
sit back and I scratch my head and then
I just wonder why some of these
companies do this blackberry to me was
always about the keyboard it was always
about being able to get down and get
business done in the past and the new
one is not so much if they're doing it's
like a mix match of different things
yeah they're trying to be something that
they're not which yes you have to
improve yes you have to expand yes you
have to do all this but you can't do so
at the is Apple ever gonna get rid of
their home button know it's there that's
that's core to the device you have to
have that because the whole thing is
built around it if they get rid of that
they're not they're not iphone anymore
it's something else and I think that's
what BlackBerry's done I focus on what
you're good at and what everybody likes
you for and not what you think people
want you know I think that's good advice
sometimes joga that that changes when
suddenly what you're good at doesn't
matter anymore its kind of like being
the being the the maker of old clipper
ships models you know it's like man
there was a market for these ones and
now or better yet like TV repair shop
writer or yeah these old retail outlets
where it's like there's a jungler my
house right down the road my house
there's a shoe repair store right next
to a sewing machine repair store and
it's like these are two different
outlets serving two very very nice
things and it's like how are you still
in business yeah you know um and that
this is this is something along shoes
are no longer something you repair there
by notable they're disposable everything
that's better my shoes zoo jovens you
live in utah you are an exception no I'm
even an exception for people who live in
Utah oh I literally I get doc martens I
get red wings and the souls will go out
and I'm on occasion or all I'll policy
or that stitching will come out and you
know for twenty bucks I go in there and
the guy just soups it up and now I have
super shoes well I wish I could find
somebody to fix my Dexter's because they
don't sell them anymore and I've been
wearing them I've been wearing these
niggas loafers for almost 10 years now
Dexter's ooh nice Christina and I wear
them probably eighty ninety percent of
the time and I have 48 for ten years I
mean they just don't wear out the souls
are getting kind of thin but i can't
find replacements for now just go to
your local shoe repair shop it doesn't
answer the next series it's not a Psalms
pocketnow serious yeah watch you sure we
are or get in anyway and I bet he'll be
able to do something for you say what
new you these are my favorite shoes what
can you do it's worth the trip yeah the
heels are fine just the ball of the foot
swearing out and there's no seam it's
their loot care about this I do care i
know you do I know everything is so hard
let's start with your only stuff I'm as
much a ship so let's talk about our sea
submarine no let's talk about Windows
Phone oh hot yes I'm sitting it's oh so
I care this is important right because
we've talked about the EOS before but
usually when we talk about the EOS it's
Tony on the podcast and we start talking
about the PureView 808 which he has
experienced with and none of us do and
we don't really get to joes or Taylor's
opinion on stuff well Taylor always
finds a way to can
tribute his opinion but way or another
we've had some newly I wanted to say
that this is like the new contender for
world's worst kept secret and
smartphones like the EOS has been so
thoroughly leaked at this point if this
is to be believed and coming from FX it
looks like it is legit this thing looks
like a Lumia 920 from the front I think
it's probably it's some somewhat of a
controlled leak I really feel it is yeah
yeah yeah because there's so many I mean
how many blurry cams of this thing have
you seen oh god I was this two minute
account we have more leaks than we're
probably gonna get product images
exactly there's so many leaks it needs
to be an RC submarine yeah Joe that was
very nice I wow well done yeah new
headlamp Nokia EOS is the RC submarine
of the smartphone world that was a very
poor clap by the way from both of us is
that right yeah that was a very poor
joke but yeah come up here let me
practice on your face boom hey listen
let's talk phones should we hey there's
a CEOs phone it's like League I don't
know I heard we're boring so maybe we
should talk about this huh still repair
uh-huh yeah never bringing it back man
no this is important this is let's put
us just on the shelf just for a second
we're boring so what are we talk about
in this episode ham radio and shoe
repair yeah we repair kits we are not
boring or we're gonna bring you
something else yeah I don't know about
you but I've talked about crashing a
bachelorette party so yeah we just we
just captured that the elusive 80 year
old demographic that we jeez anyone
right so hey can we talk about us i hear
its head some leaks yeah yeah yeah what
the most interesting thing about this to
me is that you look at these images if
you look at the piece that's linked in
the rundown I'm and the back still think
no the front looks like a Lumia 920 like
it's got the little AT&amp;amp;T globe up there
so you probably came from them and it
got its side from the nokia procam tile
which we can talk about in a second this
thing looks like look
like exactly like a Lumia 920 and then
you go down the page and then you see
the back image that we've been leaked so
much and man it's it just looks
hilarious from the back doesn't it with
that giant camera lens it looks like
have like an impact crater on a Jovian
moon it's just massive and it takes up
the entire back cover and then Jesus
anybody want to take guess of what my
least favorite element have the back it
I'm not gonna guess I'd get it wrong
come on here the fact that it doesn't
have a remote control joystick or
something yeah I didn't do any phone
that doesn't come with an RC pad i'm not
a fan of for your submarine I wonder if
Taylor knows I don't right above the
efflux watermark there are two dots
which indicate that you probably have to
slap a stupid sled on this thing to get
it to charge wirelessly which is not all
about I didn't even catch that but yeah
I I see that yes yeah but anyway listen
let's not be a downer on it that's fine
I i think i'm pretty stoked about this
still I'm very excited about that procam
tile how does Joe feel about this I
think it's great I anything you can do
to improve pictures I mean especially
you know duck face pictures taken in the
bathroom mirror for Instagram well
instagrams gonna upgrade to I think
they're going to 700 700 I don't know I
might just go over but no it's cool you
know it's it's taking a phone which ferd
forgive me here but you know Windows
Phones look like a slab to me a pretty
colored slab but this is doing something
with that it's taking something that
I've considered relatively boring from a
form factor and turning it into
something impressive and I like that
maybe it's my android side coming
through where we can do cool stuff like
that and we we have even when it's
stupid but it's pushing the platform and
I think it's I think anything that to
push a platform is good Michael you're
gonna hate me for this you're that
you're gonna read through the computer
and punch me in the face we're already
there
we're already cool um I want android on
this oh yeah I do yeah I might want to
improve sure yellow why wouldn't you
right cuz this this stands a very good
chance of being one of the finest
smartphone shooters around given this
company's history sure so why wouldn't
you I understand that I get that I
wanted on in there so bad I think the
fact now do you think this is the
crucial question do you think that
desire would drive not you but would
drive someone who was either currently
carrying or considering Android to adopt
windows phone do you think it's gonna be
that powerful we don't know the features
yet we just know that it's got probably
going to be a 41-megapixel you know the
pixel doubling thing whatever but I
think this is going to snag a lot of
people windows phone has been great it's
been like laying this base coat of
primer on the American public for a
while where it's like here's some
windows phone commercials you haven't
seen in awhile blah blah blah and it's
like oh yeah Windows Phone and out on
this town I see a little more cyan Lumia
920's I see some action going on we have
microsoft stores now i think when this
thing drops i think it's going to be a
really really big moment Steven Schenk
had a nice editorial where he was like
the EOS has to be a hit or you know for
Windows Phone and screwed and you know
whatever it was it was a great piece and
then the comments devolved into the
usual mess but but but really I you know
I think that's true but i think this
stands the best chance of being a
runaway hit Nokia's ever had I may have
said the same thing about the 928 back I
said it about the 900 that's right this
has to be awesome right we didn't row
that the 900 was going to land with the
worst camera ever or or on the worst day
of the year on Easter right yeah yeah
hey this is going to be our biggest
launch ever on his over the end or
circuits are closed yeah I went to my
local store like I wanted it and I
didn't pre-order but I wanted it and the
guy said nobody's really pre-ordered
them so you can come in on on and get it
on launch day and he failed to mention
that it was Sunday and he's going to be
closed yeah but like what yeah drove
there they're closed city and several
supposing this year I mean we're gonna
see this not this thing on the 11th
we're gonna get the announcement and I
don't probably to launch a week or two
after but but the problem is not the
hardware necessarily not even that the
specifications aren't you know
comparable to an android phone nobody
really cares about that we were talking
about that earlier nobody really cares
all that much the camera would be the
only thing that would pull people over
but the biggest problem is pulling
people to another ecosystem to to cut
ties with all the apps and things that
you've bought and everything that's
familiar heart that's the hardest part
I'm not convinced normal people think
about that I don't know on the whole I
really i wrote a piece about this like
months ago where it was like what is it
really cost for me to change an
ecosystem and I kind of looked at my own
usage and my own usage is crazy I'm like
what if I were to just uproot myself
personally from one ecosystem to another
i think i figured out i would spend like
I would have lost like 18 bucks well I
would lose like six hundred dollars in
apps apps and music and movies right I
think that the point I'm making is that
I'm a better example for for the common
for the common person then either of you
guys are and you know you know whatever
I've taken my head and geek cred this
episode already so but you know what
organ still right so so I think that
that's okay so I think that not a lot of
people really stop to consider that if
we are talking about a buying public
that that I'm kind of intimately
familiar with from my time and it will
come in and blow a whole paycheck on a
phone at full retail like yeah and we're
not talking about iOS users here because
they're there yeah devout to that I
cloud they really are right so like my
mom she's like I need something where I
can sink my notes from this to this and
I have a windows computer so I need them
on my computer to how can I do that I
said you're not gonna be able to use
iCloud use Evernote use Dropbox use
something like that and she's like no I
want to use our cloud where I can't no
we're not talking about that we're not
yet because in Windows you know I don't
think Microsoft is really even trying to
up to approved iOS people with their or
not they're trying to bring people into
their ecosystem fold in it's not up to
spec it's not it's not I despise
SkyDrive I
hated and I'm never going to use a lot
of it really despised spaghetti I mean
we sure that's fine now I'm never gonna
use a live account we've talked about
this over and over again I don't want
out look calm after Matt remaining but
this is that's a status thing and that's
the i agree the ecosystem needs work but
but but people don't always think in
terms of ecosystems that's the point I'm
making people think well so people are
going to see commercial now it's not
it's not a problem if you're trying to
capture them it's a problem for Chinese
NAR them sure but you know marketing
it's not right that's fine but users get
themselves into their own bed that's
fine users are gonna see the commercials
that they've come out for this phone and
you know no one in Microsoft there is
going to be crappy you're amazing and
it's going to be like wow this phone is
a what a 41 megapixel camera on a rail
runs Windows Phone well what I don't I
don't care for T 1 megabit you know no
but no other phone is going to be able
to hold a candle to that in terms of
just just spec allure as misguided as it
may be galaxy galaxy s4 zoom guys come
on now okay I think we're gonna have
people who yeah they want a nice phone
they want a really nice camera they're
gonna go in and look at everything
that's available the sales guy is gonna
say you want a good camera this is the
best camera out there and then they're
gonna go over to that if they are not
fully entrenched and I'm not talking
financially entrenched in the ecosystem
that they've had you know they they
haven't got a million dollars purchased
in an itunes stuff and whatnot if
they're not fully entrenched in their
current OS they're not going to care
they're going to pick it up they'll get
used to it yeah but if they've spent any
amount of time with another device on
another OS they're not going to like it
and that's nothing against windows phone
it's just different than what they're
used to on the case in point that I have
my sister is kind of a rebel older
sister she had a galaxy s2 and she'd had
some other android phones before that
and didn't like them because she always
got the cheap III ones that were low
power under spec slow and laggy because
you're getting cheap that's what you're
buying when you buy cheap you're not
buying an expensive you're buying cheap
yeah um she got this galaxy s2 and
broke it physically broke it it wasn't
any problem with the phone you know you
just should not drop it that many times
this say i'm gonna break it over my knee
yeah so she decided I'm gonna go and get
an iphone so she got an iphone 4s on
sprint yeah I know sprint and she had
and she showed it off the first week and
look I got an iphone and woohoo this was
after the iphone 5 was out and
ultimately kept coming to me would wait
how do i do this what do i do for this
how can i do this i don't know how to do
this well I can do this but it's so much
more different this is so much harder
than the other she had that phone for
two months three months tops and she's
like I can't take it anymore she sold it
on the local classifieds and used the
money that she got from that went and
got a galaxy s3 and has been super super
happy Wow yeah I had a similar story
from a friend actually I was hanging out
with her last night and she went and she
got this droid x she asked me what phone
should i get and at the time the droid x
was the bee's knees on verizon so i said
go with that get the droid x she didn't
want to switch carriers so you know she
wanted my upon she want to switch
carriers so she want the droid x and she
used it for her full two years and
upgraded to the iphone 5 and she'd been
dying for an iphone dying for an iphone
she got the iphone 5 she's been using it
since sep tember and we were hanging out
last night and she's like man i really
miss android I really do I just iOS is
ok but I really miss Android mmm and and
it's it's not necessarily she probably
hated all the lag and the bugs and the
glitches and the force closing and and
we all do nobody really likes any of
that but you you get used to it and it
becomes the norm I hated Android when I
first came to it because I was so used
to blackberry I hated iOS because I was
so used to android and blackberry so how
does this relate to Windows Phone how
does this really i'm saying i know
several people who have i was getting
there Michael thank you I know
we're answering your question is trying
to get behind the truck and pusher
little just just trying to move the show
I have about two or three friends who
have tried windows phone me when
upgraded to various windows swamp woman
with a focus but hey I like the focus
that was my first windows phone I like
that thing so they went with a focus and
and some of those had some different
ones out and as soon as they got them
they used them for about a week and
they're like I just I can't get used to
this I don't like it it's not you know
there's it doesn't have everything I
need and they go back to Android and
I've seen that outside of this tech
crowd so many times and it's I don't
think it's because windows one is bad
and it's not because it's boring like I
say it is III don't like it because I
get kind of bored really really really
quickly on windows phone but I think
it's because they can't break from what
they're used to they don't want to give
it a chance because it's so different
yeah their biggest strength is also
their biggest weakness it is different
from everything out there which is its
biggest strength they don't have a
legacy that they have to build on top of
and backwards compatibility that they
have to worry about it's a fresh slate
they're starting to get that backwards
compatibility issue now since they've
got a windows phone 7 and whatnot that
they've got to have support for and it's
different than what Windows Phone 8 and
and on up or so they've got that that's
that's a huge advantage just I think
dump everything start over but it's also
different from everything else and I
think there's also a stigma I think
there is because Windows 8 has been kind
of a flop oh yeah yeah and and the
biggest reason is the interface is not
easy and it's not set up for laptop use
or desktop use this Mon mainly for like
touch input that's what it was built
around and and and people upgrade they
get this windows 8 machine and they're
like oh my god I don't know how to use
it and I've talked to several people who
bought computers and return them because
they just don't want that they of course
don't buy a windows seven license they
just go back to their old computer or
something and and I think that's kind of
creating a stigma for windows phone
because it uses a very similar interface
as you know by design
and people are like I didn't like this
on my computer I'm not gonna like it on
the phone and it's different it's a
different experience on a phone it is I
read every animal in its far superior on
the phone it lights our superior it's
built for mobile use really and a
question yeah and it's easy to use on a
phone it's easy to use easy to navigate
but it's it there's a stigma and it and
it's not because it's so clunky on a
home it's because it's so clunky on a
desktop and a laptop that people don't
want to give it a try because it looks
the same it looks hasn't been the hit on
the desktop than Microsoft would have
liked and that that make weight having a
reverse effect yeah do you think
Microsoft named the xbox one the one
instead of the xbox eight to get away
from that stigma maybe it's gonna have I
haven't seen what xbox aight just
doesn't really have a great ring to it
but we're gonna call it the 720 for a
while there were rumors they were gonna
call it that that would have made sense
because that's double 360 but here's the
thing I don't care about that at the
moment because we have an listener mail
piece that slots really really nicely
into what we're we're talking about Hey
Joe can you stick around for one oh yeah
absolutely all right then let's start up
listener mail hello I have a question
specifically for Michael Fisher says my
hair doc Duke which is the closest I can
get to pronouncing your name properly it
is to my knowledge that your daily
driver is or was a Nokia Lumia 920 yes
that is true my DD also happens to be a
Lumia 920 my question to you is has the
freshness or novelty of Windows Phone 8
worn off for you yet or do you still
enjoy it and my hair asks says I'm
asking this because i think it wore off
for me and then goes on to suggest that
maybe nokia should do the android thing
and we're not getting into that again
I'm you know we've had that discussion
of the podcast several times I don't
want to talk about that but the real
great question is has it worn off for me
after using it for for quite a while and
it's factors so nicely into what we were
just talking about and I don't have an
answer and that's not a cop out it is a
shame because yes i use the 920 as my
daily driver but what are we doing all
the time guys bridging phone exactly
we're reviewing phones from different
platforms and so this creates this
artificial sense of when i come back to
the Lumia 920
it's a sense of relief because it means
that when i'm using this phone i don't
have to constantly treat it as a review
device it's an anniversary it right and
when I come back it's like oh wow
Lifehouse okay now i remember that and
it set up the way i want and i love it
so every time I come back to it I really
do like it I've been using it this whole
time I probably would be a little a
little tired of not being able I am
their elements of it that I find very
limiting yes I don't like that the theme
color needs to be a single like red wash
or a blue wash or something like that
like you can't assign colors to
individual tiles I don't like that I
understand the reason for it but I don't
like it I don't and I'm even now tired
of the different tile sizes I even want
almost a third level of tile size now or
a fourth level rather so yeah you know I
can understand how you would feel
limited by it I feel very limited on one
thing though is you feel ya one thing it
doesn't make sense to me is why there's
a such a small selection of colors and
one answers even smaller on windows
phone 7 they get throwed new colors for
one of their big features now you have
new colors why not just throw in a color
will why would that be so hard or bad a
color will everyone understands how it
works yeah yeah and you can set color
you wanted it's pretty awesome not all
it's genius you mean the thing is like
not it's not that you need a color wheel
necessarily mean they could just add 20
more colors not be happy but I still
wouldn't be quite happy because
everything gets painted that same color
I can't make my text message tile
awesome the same yeah I can't make my
tag message I'll different from my email
tile like for example it's like and I
get that they're going for that unity
and stuff and you know what though I
think it is time to open that up a
little bit because Metro was very fresh
when it was still called Metro it is
it's still going to be fresh to people
who've never looked at it before it's
not fresh and new to tech-oriented folks
yeah but what you were saying about
switching phones I get asked about 30
times or more a week what might daily
driver is especially on YouTube right it
was like you were using this phone the
other day why are you using this phone
now and that's kind of my daily life I
don't ever really use the same phone for
more than a couple days
this week alone my daily driver has been
the iphone 5 the HTC One the nexus for
the galaxy note 2 and the atiba right
the daily driver question is just less
arousal and these days right and I feel
like there's this implied there's a
there's an implied validity to the
device we decide to use as a daily
driver because people like well I just
want to cut through all this review
stuff and what phone do you use maybe
that one's the best one no you know the
daily driver is the best choice for for
you it's a very personal thing Joe
what's your daily driver Nexus forest oh
yeah I've been carrying the galaxy s4
with me and you know I did that for a
week week and a half because I had to
you know that's what we do for the
reviews so we're not just oh look it's
phone and blah blah blah we we abandon
what we have what our go-to devices and
we use this almost exclusively so we can
give you a good solid review but as soon
as i got that review all written and
scripted and i was happy to set that
thing down oh yeah and plug it into the
charger and let it charge up so i could
do all of the filming for the review on
a fully charged devices there's nothing
worse than getting halfway through a
shot and your battery dies yeah but yeah
I went back to the nexus 4 and I it
doesn't have the nice screen it's not
quite as fast I definitely don't have
LTE but out here in the pocket now Utah
offices verizon LTE is not all that
stellar unless it's the middle of the
night and I'm happy with what I've got
the phone does what I need it to do and
I think a lot of people are seeing that
you know it's yeah if your phone does
what you want and you're happy with it
then back to my here's question can if
you can yeah if you can keep it fresh if
you can keep it so that it does what you
needed to do and it doesn't get in your
way when you're trying to do it that's
really the measure of a good phone
that's a good daily driver and that's
one thing that keeping those windows
tiles the same color keeping them all
nice and uniform it takes away
be the fluff from the OS and the fluff
from the device and it says let's get
down to business and get this thing done
quickly and easily you're not playing
with it as much you're using it yeah and
and I get a lot of questions why do you
keep going back to the note 2 it's it's
old now and the answer to that is
actually branded was making fun of me
last week for it or earlier this week he
said you keep going back to that do
something else I'm like I love it I got
it there's a reason I go back to the
note to every time and I said this on
Twitter it's because there are two
things the s pen and the battery life
and those are the two things that make
that phone and they're what set it apart
I don't even have LTE on my note 2
because I have the international version
and yeah I don't have LT on any device I
have three carriers and I don't have LTE
I take that back i have it on my iphone
i have it on my iphone 5 on verizon but
but i don't really use that all that
much um but a the S Pen I use it once or
twice a week but when it's there I need
it and and I don't want him to use
anything else i need that S Pen do the
worst thing when you're like leaving the
note 2 to another device and you reach
for the s pen and it's not there yes you
reached out of the silo it's like how
crap i forgot that and and i have
trouble with battery life on every phone
i ever touch yeah every single one to
HTC One the reviews that we had on
pocket now they were pretty positive
with battery life not not great but but
positive it's okay it lasts yeah um mine
dies yeah just drops off same with the
nexus for my nexus 4 would last about
eight hours nine hours off the charger
you remember that i use it or not
remember that thing that your listeners
aren't gonna hear cuz is edited out
where you were like is this gonna be our
longest podcast ever Thank You variable
no problem listen with another really
awesome email from Ben Chung hello all
the pocket now I like to share with you
a thought I've had for a while I hope
you can include it in future podcast
done been ever since apple launched
their third iPad last year under the
name of the new iPad I thought it had
given them the perfect opportunity to
reveal the new iphone later in the year
why don't oh ms adopt this naming
convention for their flagship devices
HTC could bring out the new HTC One in
2014 samsung with their new Galaxy S or
is it because they still
I continued to sell older products while
Apple don't except for the iphone after
a refresh so this is a cool idea this is
something I hadn't really thought about
what do you guys think about this um
just manufacturers just kind of stealing
that thing and dropping the numbers
entirely and being like you know what
it's the new blackberry q10 or whatever
it's the new Galaxy S I think that I
think Samsung's doing that ya later I
just throwing numbers on it though yeah
we are but some things like the iPad it
works it works because everybody kind of
expects something marginal from a new
iPad and and the the upgrades to the
ipad have been modest and and and and
needed they've been good but but if you
call everything the new this they knew
that everything kind of gets a little
old and it doesn't get as exciting
anymore it also only works for like a
little while right because if you start
doing that after six years and people
are like i have the ipad oh which one do
i I've been you are the folks that you
ipad i'm gonna put that in the newspaper
when i try and sell it right i have the
new ipad from three years ago we want
you but I mean it I wrote that editorial
on the the xperia z ultra about how it's
not a smartphone but it's really a
tablet and someone in the comments who
got like seven up votes for this was
like one of the just call it nothing
people can call it what they want like
yeah that's an awesome idea why don't we
watch a product with no name that guy
was done that was that was a bad idea
but uh gaming is really difficult right
it is and it's important it's more
important than most people give it
credit for they're like I'm branding
what's in a name but there's a lot in a
name tons people don't call the galaxy
s4 the galaxy s4 they call it the new
galaxy the new galaxy right right
exactly what they call it but if you
know has galaxy yeah samsung call it
called it the new galaxy it wouldn't
make sense because there are so many
galaxy phones and if even if they call
it the new galaxy s really wouldn't make
sense because there's so many new galaxy
s's they can't do it because they make
so many different versions of everything
that's why Samsung can't do it because
you have a galaxy s4 zoom the galaxy s4
active galaxy s4 mini and the galaxy s4
hmm so what do you call all of them the
new Galaxy S
active the new galaxy it just doesn't
work in their model because they make so
many products Apple makes two three
products right ipad mini ipad and iphone
or ipod as well but I mean it's just an
emissive pro gigantic yes and look at
that one right yes you could but but it
just would this one it really doesn't
make sense the new one okay if it were
named if next year's one were called the
HTC new one our new HTC One however you
would want to name them it just wouldn't
want it doesn't ring it doesn't roll off
the tongue but to you don't get as
excited about the new this Apple has a
way of magically making everyone excited
about little things but other companies
don't have that magic formula it's
something specific to Apple it is yeah
other companies have to sell stuff that
has features that has specs Apple Apple
can sell stuff that has new yeah people
will buy it it's something that Apple
can do and Apple customers will line up
for it without you don't understand that
but like a FaceTime this one's got
facetime oh thank you SI selling face
time as a better brand name than chat
heads we're not talking about facebook
here they were chat on let's uh I don't
Ultima I would be happy to run this
conversation into the ground but we
actually have one more piece of listener
mail that can't happen unless you both
around the air so we have to get to that
which yeah Ben thank you for your
question that was an awesome question
and I'm sure we'll be talking more about
that in editorials here soon this last
piece of listener mail is from vineet
pronounced vineeth from India Thank You
vineeth first of all for the
pronunciation guide you see how I
struggle and I appreciate your help
vineeth has been following our channel
for over a year now it follows a bunch
of other channels too but he never
visits them every five hours for an
update like it has a pocket now love
your podcast Thank You Manny through
appreciate it my question is for Joe and
or Taylor because both of you have
knowledge about root and Taylor owns a
rooted HTC one
I recently got a black HTC One even
though I don't plan to root my phone
immediately I would like to know what
exactly is the difference between a rom
and a firmware custom roms normally come
saying they're based on a particular
firmware if HTC rolls out our new
firmware and i'm rooted how do i get the
new firmware onto my phone i understand
one method is to relock the phone and
bring it stock and update the firmware
is there any other method without losing
route I know this question is very
specific but I wish someone could answer
it for me generally when when HTC rolls
out an update someone will get it they
will you know update their phone to it
and not really log into anything so they
leave everything kind of stock
completely bearable in stock and then
they will help me out here Joe they will
don't they'll do a system dump and
upload it for other people who will then
probably customize it to some extent
maybe do exit or zip line and this line
and route it and so your pre routed when
you flash it and all kinds of stuff so
they'd make much either minor changes or
huge theme changes but either way they
will upload a customized version of it
for you to flash and all you do is
download that ROM boot to your recovery
do a couple wipes your cash or factory
data reset maybe dalvik and in flash it
and you're good to go okay so to answer
the kind of the second or third point in
that email if you're going to go back to
stock if you want to get a stock update
and you know let me take that one step
further when you root you do not have to
go with a custom rom and a lot of people
don't they'll root and keep the stock
rom it's just rooted so you can run root
apps that's cool that's fine love doing
it more power to you don't have to run a
custom rom when you get an over-the-air
update you are probably going to lose
root not all the time but just count on
it and you'll have to reroute and the
process to route may be different on
that update than it was before
and that's okay a lot of times they go
back these manufacturers go back and
they patch the hole that let you route
the old way in update and that might
even be the entire purpose for that
update it's just the way things are so
plan on having to reroute that that's
just a normal fact of life if you're
going to be doing it that way if you're
running a custom rom obviously you're
not going to get an over-the-air update
from the manufacturer anymore you have
to get that from whoever makes you run
which segues me into the other question
what's the difference between a rum and
a firmware those two terms can be used
interchangeably in certain contexts
generally when you're talking about a
ROM that is the the entire package that
runs on a device it's the operating
system the colonel the skins the
bloatware that whatever is in there the
configurations all packaged up into one
rom and it's just the term that we call
for it we it's probably the wrong
terminology for it but that's what we
call it a firmware technically is a
batch of software that you take and you
apply to a memory chip that's that's
firmware when we're talking about
firmware in this context it's usually
talking about what firmware does the
radio use what firmware does this or
that of the other you so it's like a
subprogram the official software usually
yeah and that's the other context is the
firmware is the official software radio
updates and whatnot weary usually refer
to those as firmwares rather than roms
even though the terminology could be
used interchangeably yeah also if you
unlock your bootloader you're probably
not going to receive your ear
over-the-air updates and also I'm not
certain that HTC will let you relock
your bootloader because you have to go
through HTC to have to unlock the
bootloader I don't believe they offer a
real Ock unlike a nexus where you can
just plug it in open up terminal and OEM
factory or factory OEM relock or
whatever yeah yeah oh yeah
lock so even luck yet who's intense
stuff yeah so it's awesome see what you
miss mind I do it on the fluffy articles
and you know editing podcast Michael man
I missed it hey so oh yeah if you're
gonna if you're going to route 22 notes
um you're gonna have to unlock first and
when you do unlock you're going to lose
everything so you're gonna want to back
up everything you can before you you do
unlock your bootloader so pictures and
everything get those off and on external
storage and make sure you want to stay
that way because doesn't look like
you're gonna be able to go back if you
decide that's not at least not with a
real locked bootloader which means even
if you go back to official software you
may not get the official updates right
so keep that in mind before you do any
of that and you may want to keep that in
mind before you go in to purchase a
device if this is something that you're
going to want to be able to do with your
device whatever device it is you've
you're going to have consequences to
your actions and you might not like
those and if that's the case get a
different device you know vote with your
wallet and buy something from somebody
else it will let you do what you want
and you may have to sacrifice you know
going with an HTC one to galaxy s4 or
you may have sacrificed by going to an
HTC one developer edition right but you
know just be and be as fully informed as
you can before you make that initial
purchase and you're not going to have
many surprises and of course the best
way to do that is by listening and
subscribing to the podcast and tuning
into pocket out vinitha I hope you were
taking notes because that was a really
huge info dump and we're really I'm
really glad that Joe and Taylor were
both on the air because I would not have
been able to answer that question in the
detail these guys can and that's why I
love y'all thank you thank you and
speaking of love of the podcast we have
a final piece of listener mail that
doesn't require any input it's just to
thank you this is from John Martin hey
to whoever reads this just wanted to say
i love all the podcasts and just
listened to five of them on my 20-hour

validates our different hosts for every
episode model oh yeah you know because I
feel like if we if it have been we three
or any other three for that entire 20
hours it wouldn't been great but yeah
John just part a little bit because
we're not saying people to Africa single
time I think you're right i think that's
