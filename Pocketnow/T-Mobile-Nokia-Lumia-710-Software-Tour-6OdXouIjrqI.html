pocketnow.com next supper and take a
look at the software on a Nokia Lumia
710 so first boot on the Lumia 710 is
actually a little bit different and then
we get to here and so same done or
saying almost done and now it wants you
to do a Nokia registration thing so here
we are now wants to assign you sign you
in with a Nokia account if I do later
there's not really anywhere to choose to
do it again so you should probably do it
here Lumia 710 is bundled with a few
programs from both Nokia and t-mobile so
here's our default home screen and setup
code fans you've got contacts random
ESPN here is an exclusive program for
Nokia devices at least for a little
while
and we'll show you how that works
and we get some scores there news video
and a social feed and you can choose
which sports you like
and it'll have an error sometimes it's a
little iffy and that's pretty much all
there is really just news and scores
and there's your menus and nothing
special either and there's no live tile
either
so and there's no way to pin certain
things so it's kind of basic not
terribly impressive we also have milky
drive you've seen this before it's a
pretty quick this is a the same one that
comes with the Nokia Lumia 800 but
there's no contacts integration
there's no Bing Maps integration it
doesn't show up as a integrated app when
you're in the contact card for location
and Bing Maps or Baine so it could be
better but it's very lightweight and
works pretty well when you get a
destination entered and under manage
maps you can download other countries or
States and continents so that you can
have offline maps problem is this device
only comes with eight gigs of ROM
storage so when I started downloading
the 1.8 gig map of the whole USA after
it was almost done it started giving me
errors and saying that it was starting
to run out of space so you have to be
aware of that
next we got something bundled from
t-mobile who got Netflix and actually
comes with The Weather Channel app
pre-installed this is a pretty good app
I really like it so we can see all sorts
of things and it does have a live tile
next up we also have app highlights from
Nokia and this is a live tile it's going
to show different types of things
different apps that it recommends so
when we launch it we can see that app
and you can scroll through different
panels here different categories that
are highlighted there and this icon is
kind of weird we don't really know what
that means but if you press the ellipses
icon we can see that it is a surprise me
button and then we shake it and it's
going to highlight something just kind
of randomly and from there if you like
that we can go to the marketplace and
download it there you go we also have
two mobile TV it's pretty much the same
as t-mobile TV on other platforms and
other phones get your choice of
streaming media and we have my account
this is a great application for checking
your minutes and your usage this is a
special SIM card so we don't get any
data there a couple other things are
included contacts transfer this is going
to let you be more contacts from your
old phone over Bluetooth to the new
phone slacker radio is also included as
is TeleNav GPS so you got two GPS
navigation programs plus Bing Maps so
that makes three navigation programs
that you can try and we have this funny
Nokia weCare app which end this is all
it is now what about the settings I've
got a couple things from Nokia here
they've got feedback to Nokia it's just
a kind of a survey on how likely you are
to recommend this not really useful and
there's some applications which and
there's nothing there so nothing really
extensive here we do have a Nokia theme
Nokia blue and we do have a couple
get ringtones so you can see right here
those a few from Nokia now how about
that camera is there anything special in
there
not really we have Auto scenes white
balance ISO one thing that you should
pay attention to is the focus mode by
default is set the macro but it's kind
of a slower focus mode so normally you
want to unnormal and then you want to go
up here and save settings because
that'll make the camera focus a little
faster with your average pictures
obviously you'll switch to macro for
your close-ups but in general you
probably want to on Mac on normal mode
so that's about it for the Nokia Lumia
710 software I didn't go over all the
great features in Windows Phone 7.5
mango you can search packing.com for our
Windows Phone 7.5 review as well as
Windows Phone 7 review and both of those
will give you tons and tons more
information about the Windows Phone
operating system that is used on the
Lumia 710 from Nokia if you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up and that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
