pocketnow.com over at freewarepocketpc
net they've got really one of the most
robust catalogs of freeware for windows
mobile devices well they've made an
application out of it called open market
and that is spelled OPN market which
allows you to browse and download up the
500 pieces of freeware and they plan on
adding to this catalogue in the near
future so let's take a look at the
application and by the way this works
with all windows mobile touchscreen
devices so we can browse by three things
right off the bat what's new most
popular and featured we can scroll
through OC the thumbnail I see a little
short description and of course the
rating can tap over two most popular
very quick application that's a very
nice interface we also have some buttons
on the bottom that will get to in a
minute so let's say we find an
application that we want to download and
of course all of these are free so let's
say we want to download let's go to most
popular let's say we want to download
pocket munoz so we tap on the entry and
then we'll get a little bit of more
information plus a download count and I
can download it right from the screen
and let's wait for it to download okay
pretty fast download speeds and after
you're done downloading it the download
button turns into install we can just
tap on that and we put it right on our
device okay and it's installed now we
can go into the start menu and find
pocket uno down here at the bottom and
within seconds you have an application
on your device from open market very
fast and very easy let's go through some
other features of open market in the
bottom right corner we can tap on my
apps to see all the applications that
you've downloaded which is really nice
so we can see pocket uno and two other
apps that I've downloaded I can tap on
one of the apps and the install button
changes to uninstall it knows that I
have this installed on my device which
is quite handy from here I can also
write a review what else you can do is
you can go down to categories and filter
by categories which is always handy so
we can go to productivity and we can go
to organize
and take a look at some applications
that fall within this category and again
once you find an app that you like gee
profile just tap on it click download
really fast download speeds right now
over Wi-Fi alright and then we can tap
install and you get the idea integrates
very well with Windows Mobile ok and
it's done and we can jump up there it is
it's already popping up and we can jump
right into the start menu and see that G
profile is indeed installed so overall
we're glad that there's finally a really
easy and and well done way to browse and
download freeware to your windows mobile
device we're looking forward to seeing
this application evolve even more and
we're looking forward to more
applications being added to the library
again you can go to freewarepocketpc net
/ open market to download this and again
it's OPN without the E and you can get
it from there that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
