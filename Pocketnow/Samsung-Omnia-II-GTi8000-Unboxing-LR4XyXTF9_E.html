pocketnow.com and we're excited to unbox
the samsung omnia 2 which is the
successor to the very popular original
omnia which kind of brought an iphone
like form factor to Windows Mobile
now the omnia 2 brings a lot of new
changes to the table such as a very
deeply integrated customized interface
from Samsung I think this is going to be
the kind of device where we're gonna
forget that it's Windows Mobile for a
lot of time that we're using it also the
omnia 2 brings an AMOLED display which
is pretty darn rare for mobile devices I
think we're gonna see a lot more of the
screen technology in the future it saves
on power it produces crisper colors
blacker blacks better contrast and the
omnia 2 also has a very fast processor
so there's a lot to talk about here
we're really excited to finally get to
see the samsung omnia 2 so let's get to
the unboxing we've got some car charger
ok not everyone will get that depends on
where you get it from and we've got a
converter plugin a pouch although this
is not a OAM pouch so I'm gonna push
that aside and let's get to the bubble
wrap here
Big O on the front o for omnia omnia
alright so let's take a look what we
have around the box
some other stuff will cover all of the
all of the specifications later this has
the TouchWiz 2.0 interface which brings
new sorts of widgets to the table before
if you remember the omnia had a very
limited range of widgets and we didn't
have some critical ones like stocks and
next appointment and so hopefully we get
that finally with the omnia - ok let's
open it up and here's the device we'll
put that aside for now we've got some
kind of some cardboard there some
software user manual screen guard
although this came extra with the
particular unit I got some other stuff
here a pouch from Samsung let me this is
not leather this is actually plastic
kind of cheap actually very soft on the
inside so it'll clean your screen when
you take out the device which is kind of
nice of course we have the wall charger
which uses the micro USB standard it
looks like at first glance which is
better than proprietary same here with
the charging cable and then we get some
headphones and a converter jack and all
that sort of stuff but let's take a look
at the device alright so here it is Wow
a lot thinner than I thought it would be
it's it's a little bit thicker than the
original omnia but it's still very very
thin it looks like it has a little
screen protector on here that I'm going
to try to remove hmm here it is Wow
beautiful hardware feels very high
quality
I like the brushed metal look to these
buttons down here no d-pad of course
which will be kind of strange but a lot
of Windows Mobile devices are skipping
the d-pad so we're quite used to that by
now
five megapixel autofocus camera on the
back with flash looks like there's
actually two flashes it's kind of
interesting I'll have to look into that
anyway let's compare this with other
devices that you may know such as the
HTC touch diamond2 similar form factor
although the omnia 2 has a larger 3.7
inch screen the diamond 2 only has a 3.2
inch screen the omnia 2 is actually a
bit thinner it feels like and it feels
it feels wider definitely to accommodate
the larger size screen let's look at the
Touch HD which is actually very similar
in terms of width if you stack them on
top of one another and then with they're
about the same the omnia 2 is a little
bit thicker than the Touch HD let's take
a look at how it compares through the
iPhone well flip it around and the omnia
2 has a larger screen than the iPhone
and thicker definitely thicker and just
for comparative purposes let's take a
look at the touch pro2 which of course
has a slide-out keyboard the omnia 2
does all of the keyboard action on the
screen really curious as to how good the
on-screen keyboard is on the omnia 2
whether it works in landscape a lot of
questions we have to answer about the
omnia 2 can't wait to look at the AMOLED
display and compare it to other devices
we're going to do a dedicated video just
comparing kind of colors and contrast
and that sort of thing so we're really
curious about the AMOLED display so a
lot more coming up on the samsung omnia
2 to know exactly when our next video
