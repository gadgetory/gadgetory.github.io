pocket now the vivo NEX has a 6.6 inch
display and yet it has about the same
footprint as like an iPhone 8 plus or
even a 1 plus 6 it's able to achieve
this because it has almost a 90% screen
to body ratio because it does some
pretty interesting hardware tricks to
hide certain sensors and features so
that he can achieve this massive screen
to body ratio and give you a 6.6 inch
screen definitely one of the most
impressive devices to come out this year
in this video I want to show you all the
quirks and features of the vivo NEX and
talk about using it as my daily driver
for a couple of weeks to experience this
very futuristic phone so let's get to it
okay so let's talk about the vivo necks
and how they were able to achieve this
really high screen to body ratio and
talk about all the interesting things
that this phone does so quite simply
this phone got rid of everything on the
top which has a few compromises so first
of all the front-facing camera by going
to the camera by the way I'm running a
third-party launcher action launcher
because I didn't really like the
launcher that came on this phone with
the fun touch OS that's seriously what
it's called it actually has some nice
touches which I'll show you in a sec so
first of all I'm gonna go to the camera
and you can see when I turn on the front
facing camera it pops out of the top now
you might be wondering is that another
thing to break well vevo claims that
they have tested this to go up and down
successfully 50,000 times furthermore
there's a safety feature beat built-in
so that if you tap it by accident it
just kind of goes away like it like a
cd-rom drive so really not that big of a
deal if we bring out the 1 plus 6 which
has actually a very similar footprint
you'll notice that the 1 plus 6 has this
notch at the top that contains the
front-facing camera which is covered by
the retractable mechanism it's got a
speaker and it has a proximity sensor
and an LED notification light the v1x
does not have an LED notification light
but it does have a speaker it's just
built into the screen and it works
really really well so if you look
closely at the top you'll see that
there's literally no speaker on the vivo
necks instead it uses
a piezoelectric technology I forget
exactly what the term is where it
vibrates the screen so when you're on a
phone call
you can put your ear here here here or
anywhere on the screen and you can still
hear the person on the other end and it
surprisingly sounds really good
probably not as crisp as a regular
traditional earpiece like on the 1 plus
6 but for a new technology it works
really well and it gets loud enough for
you for you to be able to hear it in
loud environments so let's dive in the
operating system a little bit more like
I said this is called fun touch OS and
it's actually on Android 8.1 which is
good
this phone is really good specifications
by the way it's got the snapdragon 845 8
gigs of ram i find it to be very very
fast and the operating system is
actually pretty nice and it reminds me
of a combination between iOS and Android
P like look at the notification style if
they're kind of rounded it's really not
that bad actually and there's a lot of
control that you get for navigation
you'll notice that I have these three
lines along the bottom they're kind of
like the one plus gestures kind of like
the iPhone gestures to really wear like
a swipe up brings you back home there's
a lot of configuration options for these
navigation controls along the bottom
which I love let me show you what they
look like and as you can see I'm swiping
up from the right to go back if I swipe
up from the left oh I love this so in
the notification shade you don't have
any of your quick toggles but instead
vevo has created this iPhone like
control center along the bottom which is
actually super convenient because you
don't have to reach all the way up to
the top of the phone to be able to
access it and literally it's the same
it's almost the same as control center
on iOS except that as shortcuts to your
recently used apps you can adjust screen
brightness volume turn on all of the
different modes and so forth and scroll
over to the side and you can actually
customize it so really nice use of space
by placing that little shortcut on the
bottom ok so let's go over to system
navigation you can have navigation keys
if you want standard navigation keys and
you can change the order if you like
your back button on the right your back
button on the left here's a hint back
buttons should be on the right shouldn't
they because if you're right-handed
that's where your finger is going to go
oh well some people will disagree that's
okay so you can have on screen
navigation buttons you can have
navigation gestures and there's all
these different customization options on
where the back button is and exactly
what happens in various modes but like
the cool thing about these navigation
gestures and I'm just going to leave
them on now is that it gives you the
full six point six inch display without
obscuring it with anything like not on
screen nav buttons so you really get an
immersive experience it's really
fantastic so how does it look when
you're watching YouTube let's check it
out because this is obviously a media
consumption device so I've got some
subscriptions here some random things
let's go to alright so here's the pocket
now daily I just zoomed in to get a full
screen experience and by the way there
is a loud speaker on this phone a single
loud speaker listen and you can of
course cover it up easily but it's
pretty loud actually if you turn it up
all the way it's okay it's not great but
watching videos on this phone and I wish
that it would have expanded all the way
to the navigation area but this is still
a really immersive experience to watch
videos on a six point six inch nearly
bezel this display it just looks really
great the viewing angles are awesome the
screen has a really nice pixel density
above 400 PPI
and it's AMOLED too so it's super crisp
and the colors are also quite nice let's
talk about the back of the vivo NEX
which has a really interesting pattern
with little dots that reflect the light
it's kind of hard to see but when you
get the light just right it kind of
reminds me of the Nexus 4 with that kind
of glistening pattern so it's really
nice it's extremely slippery although it
comes with a case in the box to add a
significant amount of grip but also bulk
we've got two cameras up here and the
the primary camera is a 12 megapixel F
1.8 lens it's got optical image
stabilization the second camera is five
megapixels effort
point four and is used primarily as a
depth depth sensor the front-facing
camera eight megapixels and F 2.0 and
actually the the photos that this takes
is really good surprisingly I say
surprisingly because it's not a phone
from Google it's not a phone from Apple
but I've taken some pictures at night
the low-light performance is
surprisingly good it can see a lot of
light in the dark so the camera
interface looks just like an iPhone
interface honestly with the slider on
the bottom you can record in 4k but not
for k60 unfortunately we can go into AR
sticker mode and do really strange
things and then there's a full manual
mode which is nice and its overall
snappy camera experience with very
little shutter lag I really like the
camera on this phone I think it's a
surprise bright spot so I'm going to use
this phone I set this up it's got my sim
card in it this particular version does
work on my carrier AT&amp;amp;T in the US I'm
getting 4G which is also LTE on AT&amp;amp;T and
the the reception has been actually
pretty good for a phone that's not
intended to be used in the US but I'm
going to use it I'm gonna use it as my
daily driver for a week or to see what
it's like to use a phone that's almost
entirely screen on the front very
futuristic see if the strange camera
configuration with a pop-up is annoying
at all the only place I could see that
being annoying is that it just adds time
if you're trying to take a quick picture
with the front-facing camera I mean I
mean how long does it actually take it's
not that much of a difference so let's
see you have to click this button and
then one two it's like three seconds but
you know three seconds is a lot when
you're trying to take a picture real
quick so that's the only real downside
that I see pretty strong in terms of its
components so that's just a quick look
at the quirks and features of the vivo
NEX
I'll definitely I will definitely
discover more things about this phone as
a you
my daily driver for a couple of weeks
let me know in the comments if there's
anything you want to see specific to
this phone or if there are any
comparisons you you want me to do maybe
a direct comparison with the oneplus six
or maybe the iPhone 10 or something drop
a comment let me know thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
