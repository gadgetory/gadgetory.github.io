awful hand oh my god I agree oh hai mei
you and pink so sexy if you're talking
about pink the singer yeah why don't you
say your first name in English it don't
make you a more cooler to say it in
Spanish in fact just more annoying I'm
asthmatic and I have a very hispanic
main but i don't say it in spanish i say
it in english because i live in America
just saying hey I live in America too
buddy and news flash i like my name the
way it's pronounced correctly which is
in spanish but then again hey you can
pronounce your name however you want
that's your right this is mine that's
right it's that time of the week i am
high memory that others pocket now and
this is the pocket out daily recap the
last week and monday the topic was the
iphone 7 the possible color options a
space black that we heard there and i
ask you if you have to pick a color
option which would it be we had 1071
comments thanks a lot guys I want space
black because of sorry but Space Gray is
so ugly in my opinion I'm curious about
that deep blue though you know I'm
actually very curious about that deep
blue as well but I am sorry that the
space grey is going away because it's
it's kind of my favorite color even
though yeah I like the bluetooth I love
space black with its stealthy look but
even if it gets all messed up after some
time people will still going to buy it
so you know it's probably my biggest
concern in the case of the iphone 5 that
black finish looked terrible after a few
dents let's see how this one handles hi
met even if Apple comes with a limited
edition more battery iphone but only
comes with it in hot magenta covered
glitter I'll take it I know a lot of
people that will I'd rather go for
another phone that the hot glittery um
to say the topic was the possibility of
for the google phone and i asked you do
you think that there is a need for it
along with the nexus lineup we had 432
comments it could be possible that the
nexus will be the flagship while google
phone is the premium mid-ranger it could
be google is rather unpredictable but
we've seen Android one kind of silently
go away so that could be the case so why
did they sell motorola and if they were
still going to end up building their own
phone anyway dude i totally agree i
never understood why google bought
Motorola and so that it would have made
all the sense in the world if Google
would have just kept using motorola as
the google brand but hey I don't see a
google phone happening because it would
not make sense to compete with its own
Nexus program I totally agree but then
the Nexus program has been something
that Google has never been worried about
using to compete with anybody so that's
just why it's so much more confusing
then on Wednesday the topic was a
possible force touch home button sort of
like the force touch trackpad on the mac
lineup instead of a current home button
on the iphone 7 I asked you what you
thought about that and we had 570
comments Apple should make their iphone
for such blend it into the screen so we
can unlock it from pressing anywhere on
the display amen brother let's just wait
for that well anything is better than
the gigantic bezels on the current and
previous iphone models yeah I just don't
know if those bezels were going anywhere
but we can always hope I don't like
Apple but I think they need to keep the
home button is a classic you know I do
agree the home button has existed ever
since the launch at the first iphone but
then Apple totally got rid of the click
wheel with the ipod line up when they
launched the touch so you never know
that on thursday android 70 nuga got
announced i asked you what did you think
about the name we had 1243 comments
thanks a lot guys it's cute to main
Android food names better than numbers
at least iOS 10 for example I don't
agree i prefer the numbers or the
letters for that matter who cares but
pastries hard to pronounce never ate it
should have been Nutella I do agree we
called the one kit kat why not just go
to tell it would have been just so much
easier it doesn't matter what the name
is since barely ten percent of android
users will even be running that Oh as a
year from now oh my god that was a sick
burn but true and then finally Friday
the topic was the possible the mists of
the 64 gig iphone it seems that Apple is
going to start at 32 gigs then jump 228
like we have with the ipad pro line up
ask you what you thought about that do
you think that 128 gigs is overkill we
had 643 comments at least the 16
gigabyte took a hike too oh yeah
seriously I don't know but 64 gigs are
plenty enough for me you know it's funny
for me storage is always more important
but then I got the 128 gig iphone 6
never filled it up I know
there will be a time when you will need
more storage this applications get
complex etc etc but as it stands I went
back to 64 gigs 128 gigs of storage
overkill since when is any amount of
storage overkill the more the merrier I
have to agree with you this is the 128
gig ipad pro i do feel that there are
certain products that need more storage
like in the case of a tablet because i
carry a lot of movies with me because in
the case of a computer because pretty
much my entire life is there but then in
the case of the phone there are a lot of
things that i don't carry i feel that
there are products that do warrant more
storage there are promised products that
don't but then again that's my opinion
i'm sure that for everybody else is
different that's it for the bargain out
