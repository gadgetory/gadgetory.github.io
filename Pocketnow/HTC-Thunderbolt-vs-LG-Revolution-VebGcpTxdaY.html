Thunderbolt for Verizon 4G supremacy all
right let's kick off today's face-off
between the LG revolution and HTC
Thunderbolt then we're going to run down
a specs on both of our contestants will
do a boot up and check for available RAM
we're going to run a quadrant standard
smart bench and linpack pro android
tests we're going to do our unofficial
speed test well little gaming exhibition
have our browser comparison and at the
end of this video you don't want to
stick around we're going to have
attached two samples of 720p video
capture from each of today's contest and
so make sure you stick around for that
all right let's kick this off LG

showing 480 x 800 pixels upper
right-hand corner you've got a 1.3
megapixel front facing camera for video
calls and below the display you have

Thunderbolt weighs in at 164 grams so
definitely the lighter of the two offers
the same 4.3 inch TFT capacitive touch
display same resolution of 480 x 800
also has a 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera for video calls in the upper
right hand corner again for touch

flash geo-tagging as well as face

the battery on the LG revolution 1500
milliamp hour battery rated at seven
hours and 25 minutes of talk time HTC
Thunderbolt 1400 milliamp hour battery
rated at six hours and 30 minutes of
talk time all right let's talk a bit
about the memory on both of these the
revolution comes with 16 gigabytes of
internal storage also comes with a 16
gigabyte microSD card in
cert it into the slot which is nice and
offers 512 megabytes of RAM HTC
Thunderbolt comes with 8 gigabytes of
internal storage a 32 gigabyte install
pre-installed micro SD card and 768
megabytes of RAM both phones offer Wi-Fi
802 11 BGN support for DLNA and HDMI LG
revolution offers bluetooth version 3.0
while the Thunderbolt offers bluetooth
version 2.1 they both run on qualcomm
msm8974 a 2.2 froyo as our operating
system let's fire up both of our
contenders and check for available RAM
and after boot and LG is on its way and
so is the Thunderbolt
alright the revolution looks to be
coming alive and here comes the
Thunderbolt
alrighty
alright we've got that one with that
settled down for a minute
alright
looks like on the LG revolution there is
about 220 230 megabytes of available RAM
and we'll let the Thunderbolt settle
down for a minute then about looks like
it's going to offer somewhere around 250
mega because sitting four hundred and
fifty megabytes of available Ram so
you've got 230 versus 430 megabytes of
available ran between the revolution and
HTC Thunderbolt first up we're going to
run the quadra Center benchmark test
that goo clean start alright let's check
our results and on the revolution 1941
as a benchmark score and on the
Thunderbolt tilt that make sure I got it
right 1724 so our benchmark winner is
the LG revolution next up we'll run the
smart bench test and it's how we clean
start again on both alright let's check
our scores for the smart bench test and
we have a winner in the LG revolution
both in the productivity index as well
as it games index so both cpu and GPU on
the productivity in x 1280 3 vs 1088 and
on the games index 1331 versus 1278 up
to this point it's been all LG
revolution let's run the little impact
pro for android test on both and we have
a result in again the LG revolution mega
flops 37.1 six and two point two six
seconds on the HTC Thunderbolt 34.7 for
two mega flops in 2.41 seconds so it
looks like our overall winner as far as
our quadrant standard smart bench and
Olympic protests are the is the LG
revolution I think it's time for our
unofficial speed test I've got advanced
task killer loaded on both let's go back
in and close all the background tasks on
both we'll head back to the home screen
trying to launches as close as I can
calendar that looked as if it
the LG revolution dry maps that was the
Thunderbolt that looked to be the
Thunderbolt as well that looked to be
the Thunderbolt let's try people on both
or contacts that was definitely the
Thunderbolt let's try messaging that was
the Thunderbolt as well we have
different markets so for some reason
hasn't updated almost try the phone on
both what's definitely the Thunderbolt
let's try third party movies definitely
the Thunderbolt so while the LG
revolution won all of our tests in our
unofficial speed test and I know it's
again unofficial there go the title the
HTC Thunderbolt seemed to outperform the
LG revolution I've downloaded raging
thunder to on both the revolution and
thunderbolt and we're going to kick
these off at the same time check for low
times and it will run a lap on each will
start with thee
revolution
all right now let's take a look at the
Thunderbolt
that was interesting I got pushed right
to a brick wall
ah
alright there's a look a little gaming
on our two contestants alright it's time
to wrap up today's pocket now face off
for Verizon 4G domination between the LG
revolution an HTC Thunderbolt with our
browser comparison don't forget the 720p
video comparison follows directly after
this so hang out and wait for that all
right I've got both running up the same
Wi-Fi network I've got the cache and
history cleared on both I've got plugins
enabled on demand and they both been
updated to Adobe Flash 10.3 which
probably we want to use but it's been
done so I wanted to make sure you knew
about it go to bookmarks when I say we
head over to and gadget to kick this off
and we're off and they're both quick out
of the chute looks like the revolution
might be just a little bit ahead then it
comes to Thunderbolt now it's the
Thunderbolt revolution the winner is
going to be Thunderbolt both of them no
problem loading the entire page on
either one the revolution definitely
looks and feels a bit smoother in
handling the page zoom in for both
double tap pinch-to-zoom both very
responsive one thing that's nice on the
Thunderbolt when you pinch to zoom it
dynamically reformats the text to fit
the display it's not that it's a big
deal you simply have to double tap on
the revolution to get it to rewrap the
taxa fit to display both of them handle
it very well but the Thunderbolt does
feel a little bit smoother and I saw
that one AD there I'm relatively certain
I've got they will plugins to set to on
demand on both yep just to make sure
alright let's head on over to pocket now
on both get our bookmarks here and we're
off one of our first heat was the
Thunderbolt
again looks like the Thunderbolts going
to be our winner here as well and again
now it's the time to load the ads on the
right hand side of the page now you know
why I did enable flash because this
would have taken even longer for this to
happen looks like the Thunderbolts going
to take it eventually maybe not maybe
not Thunderbolts first any issues nope
full pages they're definitely not as
smooth as engadget and still waiting on
here comes the revolution revolution is
done and again it's got it all but
definitely not as smooth double tap to
zoom in and you can see that we're
taxing these guys a bit with pocket now
full sight come on back there we go
alright let's go and take a look at the
article itself on both which I think
will be a bit easier for them to handle
and the winner getting here I gave the
revolution a head start we'll see if it
ends up that way and again they've got
to now load the right-hand side of the
page
getting it
and we're simply waiting for them to
finish loading the right hand side page
and the revolution was first followed by
and still working on it's a thunderbolt
and you can see that this is a lot of
work for both of them and there we go in
a pinch to zoom they've got their brains
working now the more issues both of them
handled everything pretty well I would
have to say for the most part except for
the one time the Thunder boat was a
little bit smoother the revolution
though I think loaded pages I think a
little more pages quicker than the
Thunderbolt but you might have to be the
judge of that for yourself because i
don't remember believe it or not after
just doing it is anyway this is a craig
for pocket now i hope that's been
helpful don't forget to hang out for our
video comparison take care
