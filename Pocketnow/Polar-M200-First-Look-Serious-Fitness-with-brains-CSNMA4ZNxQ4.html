fitness oriented smartwatches and its
latest product blends serious Fitness
with some brains I'm he met a van with
pocket now and let's talk about the
polar m200 as we discussed in our recent
polar m600 video serious heart rate
monitoring started with polar 30 years
ago and continues today the polar m200
may not bring the brains of Android wear
but competes with more the likes of
products like the Fitbit surge or a
Garmin difference really is that you're
getting more bang for your buck here
your standard fitness SmartWatch either
doesn't have a replaceable band a
complete irony and durability for a
product you're going to beat up or the
software doesn't allow for many workout
options or it's just not suitable for
swimming the polar m200 is a different
animal altogether first of all the
hardware is water-resistant and suitable
for swimming the polyurethane band that
surrounds the watch is fully replaceable
and the replacement is just twenty
dollars with different color options and
since the band is actually all the watch
exterior when replacing the band you'll
notice the coolest trick as this watch
charges through standard USB that USB a
connector also serves if you want to
stick to polar flow on the desktop but
the m200 includes bluetooth connectivity
to sync with your standard smartphone
through polar flow the 180 milliamp
power battery ensures six days of 24/7
activity tracking considering one hour
of GPS fitness tracking a day though
your mileage may vary depending on if
you use it further or less there's a
significantly large heart rate sensor at
the bottom to assist in tracking your
daily activities and workouts and what
makes power efficiency possible is the
one-inch dot-matrix display that
includes a backlight the left button
serves as a back button and the right
button serves to navigate on a short
press or to select with a long press the
dots on the bezel serve as a navigation
bar for menus but what I liked the most
about this watch is that during workouts
the dots blend with the digits on the
bezel to tell your heart rate training
zone
polar is pretty much one of the few
companies that enable smart training
through this feature on its watches and
later through the application and really
the app is where everything is syncing
the watch requires a long press to the
left button and then polar flow gives
you a comprehensive look of how you
performed along with some insights on
the type of training you had honestly
for 150 dollars I think this watch
really makes it hard for any other watch
to compete at this price range you get
24/7 tracking which includes sleep GPS
connectivity there's a long list of
workouts you could track with it and you
can add more through the application it
has training zone information and
trekking even includes swimming
swapping bands is the easiest thing and
polar flow connectivity even helps the
watch become your personal trainer the
watch also includes options for
vibrating notifications and alarms from
your smart phone though I probably
wouldn't consider it fancy enough to be
your day-to-day watch though maybe the
black band could change my mind about
that for everything else the polar m200
is a great fitness watch that I highly
recommend you give a try and which will
continue testing over the next few weeks
