pakka calm this is another episode of
the windows phone 7 app roundup in which
we review fired applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called amazing into this
free on the windows marketplace so what
it is is photo editing application but
it's very simple so I do is choose a
photo to edit and it can pick some of my
sample photos here let's choose this
koala so now i can add all these
different effects that I'd like I can
also crop it and also pixelate and
remove redeye and all that great stuff
so let's say I want to change it to a
inverted color so that turns into sort
of a negative and just revert ologies
click the X and it goes back the house
undo and save kayak there's a free
application available on the windows
marketplace that allows you to find
hotels and flights on your windows
device so I just go to flights let's say
on to my flight and I can just change my
airport here or choose Seattle and now
my destination airport now I have to
just change my departure time and return
time so we'll just click done and search
for flights so it came up with 765 years
olds let's just click on here to book
this flight i'll have to just call one
of the toll-free numbers or just click
on the link to go to the other websites
ticket is a fun and challenging puzzle
game in which you must dig into the
ground on this farm to open and unlock
and find these various treasures as you
can see there's one right there so I've
dug this entire town now if i want to
find any other treasure aaj news clip
date through this area and i'm getting
money as i dig this rock out so i can
just go down here and it looks as though
i may have found something I'm just
going to dig a little bit further and I
found a pocket watch that the farmer has
lost in the past sought to just return
this to them and then I get more money
where is a free application available in
the windows marketplace that will find
practically anything in your proximity
so let's they don't to find something to
eat I'll just click on here or I can
also search there's also some favorites
that you can have and your own profile

restaurants or any one of these on rows
of restaurants I can also get drinks if
I want to go out later and can also find
activities to do and
information so i can get weather news
traffic and prices for gas so as you can
see the forecast right now is 46 degrees
pirates ahoy is a free game available in
the windows marketplace that is similar
to fruit ninja but we also have a
classic version and a drunk version so
let's go to the classic version it's
sort of like fruit ninja in which you
have to avoid various objects while
you're slicing across the screen so we
want to slice across all of these sea
creatures and all these other pirate
like objects not object of the game is
to get the highest points before year
you either mess up too many times in
which indian school goes away or you hit
one of these skulls and your game is
