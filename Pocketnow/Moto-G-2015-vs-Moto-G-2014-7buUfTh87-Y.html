the Moto G the new iteration brings a
few hardware bumps and much more
customization to Motorola's best-selling
smartphone and while we'll have complete
impressions in next week's full review
first let's take a look at what's
changed and what hasn't between
generations I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is moto G 2015 vs.
moto G 2014 iteration is the name of the
game when it comes to the mid-range and
the Moto G bears that out the new phone
is ever so slightly larger and more
massive than the older one but it makes
up for that with an ipx7 water
resistance rating something last year's
moto G lacked it's also got a more
grippy back cover thanks to the fine
line texturing and then there's moto
maker last year's model made you swap
back covers to add a little style but
the new Moto G gives you the full suite
of customization from accent color to
custom engraving and you can still swap
colors on the fly if you want to the
five inch 720p display is the same size
and resolution as last year
it features cleaner cooler whites and
slightly better dynamic range but it
also seems to have lower saturation and
contrast and less inky blacks honestly I
prefer last year's panel under the hood
there's now a Snapdragon 410 a 64-bit
upgrade to last year's Snapdragon 400
that also includes an improved graphics
processor and support for a wider range
of LTE bands than its predecessor you
also get more options for storage and
RAM with the newer model up to 16 gigs
and two gigs respectively up from eight
and one and the microSD slot remains
it's all powered by a nineteen percent
larger embedded battery in the newer
phone that helps it average about five
hours of screen on time and almost half
again improvement over what we averaged
on last year's phone when it comes down
to the details some things have improved
while others have not the newer phone
has much more subtle haptic feedback so
it doesn't rattle like the older one
when you type quickly that's good but
the buttons at least on our review
device are a mushy er and more awkward
than last year the new plastic
accent feels kind of chintzy the speaker
and earpiece grills are no longer
symmetrical and the bezels flanking the
display are much thicker than before if
that's the kind of thing you notice you
might want to go for the black faceplate
as it covers up some of those blemishes
it's a much more straightforward story
in software everything is better now
we're using the higher-end version with
two gigs of RAM so of course performance
is zippier and apps stay in memory
longer that's expected but much more
interesting is that Motorola has ported
more of the Moto software suite to the G
this year that means moto display will
automatically flash the time and your
notification count when you pick up the
phone it means you can launch apps like
the camera and toggle functions like the
flashlight with simple gestures and it
means your phone can read text messages
to you when it detects your driving or
at home or silence your ringer when
you're in a meeting or sleeping last
year's Moto G could only do that last
bit otherwise we're again looking at
nearly bone stock Android on the third
gen Moto G though here it's 5.1.1 to the
older phones 5.2 that means a lot of
improvements from memory management to
notification settings making the newer
phone even breezier right out of the box
probably the biggest improvement on
paper between the GS can be found in the
camera not only does the newer phone
bring a dual tone LED flash for better
skin tone preservation it boosts the
resolution from 8 megapixels to 13 by
repurposing the sensor from the Nexus 6
and it's been further improved with the
new IR filter to reduce glare plus the
selfie camera around front has jumped
from 2 megapixels to 5 what's all that
mean out in the real world
pretty nice improvements there's a
market increase in clarity when you make
the jump from the old G to the new one
with less noise and slightly higher
contrast in some cases in direct
sunlight
reds are less likely to blow out on the
new
which also does a better job of handling
challenges like intense and backlighting
HDR photos are also more impressive this
year they're more colorful and lend a
better sense of depth in low-light the
sharpness advantage of the Moto G 2015
continues but in very dark settings we
did run into problems focusing with the
newer device problems we didn't
experience as deeply on last year's
phone
same deal when we fired up that flash
yes the new phone's module did a better
job of preserving flesh tones but the
result was often blurrier as though
focus was taking longer and never quite
getting there and on the selfie side
we're happy for the higher resolution
but the amount of light captured is way
down all things being equal we'd
certainly take the newer phone over the
old one as far as the camera is
concerned and considering the Moto G
2015 starts at the same price its
predecessor did we're willing to give it
a pass on a few of these issues the
bottom line is it's a very solid camera
upgrade for 179 dollar smartphone we've
only spent a few days using the Moto G's
side-by-side and again we'll have a
complete verdict on the newer phone
including video samples in the full
review next week
the main question we're trying to answer
in this comparison is did Motorola
improve on last year's model enough to
justify you choosing the newer phone
over the older one the answer is
absolutely yes in some ways it's not as
attractive and the camera bumps aren't
as dramatic as you might expect but moto
maker waterproofing and the additions to
the Moto suite combined with all the
other little improvements to make the
new Moto G a much better buy even if you
can find the older phone for cheaper
