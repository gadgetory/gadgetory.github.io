technology firm letv
but the company sold four million
smartphones in less than a year and now
it's bringing the first Snapdragon 820
powered model to the US I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
first look at the letv max
pro the most important thing to get
about the letv max pro is that it's a
kind of prototype design we won't see
the phone hit the US in this
configuration but a lot of the features
it's packing like that high-end
Snapdragon 820 and four gigs of ram 21
megapixel camera and the internal
storage options up to 128 gigs are
likely to make it into the phone we do
see maybe that will include the
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
powered by sense ID which Qualcomm says
offers better security and accuracy than
a capacitive sensor letv says it'll work
even when your fingers dirty or wet and
even through a layer of metal or plastic
over the top of the sensor the max pro
also packs the newer faster eight or two
point 11 AD Wi-Fi compatibility and a 33
or 34 hundred milliamp hour battery
big but maybe not big enough considering
that huge 6.3 inch quad HD display will
see really its the novel hardware specs
and the content focused software that
make the max pro interesting instead of
a Google now panel off to the left
there's the le TV content catalog with
movies and TV shows available for rental
or purchase currently limited to Chinese
programming because this is a Chinese
device the rest of the device is pretty
familiar from the aluminum casing with
distinctive antenna channels to the
marshmallow based GUI that's only one M
away from belonging to another major
Chinese firm in many ways the max pro
feels like a derivative of high-end
Huawei's of yesteryear but keep in mind
that this is an early design and what we
see eventually make it to American
shores may look and feel quite different
with such powerful guts in the phone and
such profound growth from the company
behind it will certainly be paying
attention when that happens we're
covering a lot more from CES 2016 here
in Las Vegas so stay tuned here in the
tube and at pocketnow.com until next
time this has been michael fisher with
high auto Houston behind the camera
thanks for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
