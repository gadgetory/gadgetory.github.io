pocketnow.com we've gone through an
awful lot of iterations of Android but
we're only up to version four 4.0.4 is
the latest at least as of this recording
but what did it look like in the early
days let's take a look at Android
version 1.1 so this is Android 1.1 I'm
running it in an emulator and it just
kind of gives us an idea of what Android
was like way way back in the day now
most people didn't use this version of
Android even early adopters most of us
got started with Android version 1.5
which was called cupcake or 1.6 which
was called donut this is version 1.1 and
I don't know if it had a cute little
dessert name I don't know what a and B
were if you do please leave that in the
comments over pocketnow.com so so we can
have some history here we can go ahead
and check for some system updates but so
you can tell running in an emulator not
everything works let's go ahead and head
back to the home screen now you'll
notice we've got kind of a familiar home
screen we've got the notification bar up
on top I've got Bluetooth turned on I
don't have any cellular connection over
here and since I'm running an emulator I
don't have a battery it's showing the
time which for some reason isn't correct
and it doesn't match with the clock
widget down here the clock is actually
showing the correct time the clock up
here in the status bar is not but we'll
let that slide let's go ahead and look
at how this works notice we've got three
panels that we can slide between no more
than that no less than that that was the
the option we have widgets let me get
back over to the home screen
they have widgets here's a clock widget
here's our Google search widget over on
the side and we have application icons
like all other versions of Android if we
long press on the home screen we're
given a menu of things that we can do
unlike other versions of Android this is
a little bit different from what we can
do in in the more recent iterations here
we can add applications and shortcuts to
the home screen this is different
depending on what version of Android
you're using in the future we can also
add widgets and we can change the
wallpaper using the wallpaper picker the
main difference between this and current
versions all of these are just nested
menus inside the list so you can
literally look through everything that
you can add to the homescreen right on
this one window let's go ahead and add a
search widget just like that easy enough
go ahead and search in here I can type
and talk at the same time just like that
now I don't have an internet connection
so you're not gonna see anything here
but you'll notice the browser looks an
awful lot alike a lot has changed in the
the nuts and bolts of the browser but as
far as how things look the menus the the
error messages and whatnot all pretty
much the same go back home our dialer
this may be a throwback some of you
might remember seeing this dialer in the
early versions the only things that
really changed were the the color and
kind of the dimensionality of the
buttons they became kind of square
square with an underline kind of a
square with a brace it depended on
really your manufacturer as well this
could be customized but back in the day
it was just a very basic push button we
have the call log of course I can't call
anyone with the emulator so we don't see
a list but a very nice thing to have
contacts as well and then favorite
contacts let's and that's where this is
as well that's a shortcut that takes you
into a different area of the same app
that's one thing that Android did that
was a little bit different you could
have multiple different entry points
into an application so this would take
you into the dialer app and the dialer
tab whereas contacts would take you into
the dialer app and into the contacts tab
a little bit different these days but
you get the point
Maps can't show you much because there's
a problem with my connection but
it looks essentially the same we've got
the grid we've got the Google logo and
come in here to menu and it won't let us
do anything because it can't connect so
we'll go ahead and go back this was in
the days before latitude by the way
here's our app drawer you'll notice it
does look just like a drawer that you'd
pull out of a desk you pull the tab out
just clicking on it really you could
pull it up or click on it just single
tap on it whatever you wanted to do
there which was kind of fun and novel
we've got our alarm clock app very basic
could set repeating alarms change them
to whatever calculator was very basic
though you did have the advanced panel
that you could jump into music even more
basic if I go back to the home page here
we get sort by artists we could sort by
albums we could do an entire song list
and if I've got any playlists saved you
can do that I don't but that's what it
would look like so there's a quick look
back at Android version 1.1 so you can
compare it to what you have in your
pocket today kind of see how far we've
come in the few short years since
Android was released if you think I
missed something in the video that you'd
like to call out and share with the rest
