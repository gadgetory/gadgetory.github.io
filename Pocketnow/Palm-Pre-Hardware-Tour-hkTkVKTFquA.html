calm and wearing take a look at the
hardware tour of the palm pre and we'll
start up on the front we got a three
point one inch screen the resolution is
320 x 480 and you got one button there
and you have a speaker up here and looks
like a microphone right there lots of
fingerprints get on their screen on this
side we have a little plastic pork cover
this is the micro USB
on the top
there's a mute switch goes from audio on
to vibration on and here's the power /
sleep button press it once so go into
sleep mode hold it down to a lot
completely here's a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack on this side we have some volume
buttons up and down nothing on the
bottom on the back we have a nice palm
logo speaker grill 3 megapixel camera
and the LED light for flash now we also
have a sliding keyboard the buttons I
looked it flat so they're a little heart
of the field and the treo pro and you
have this edge all around here and just
pretty sharp definitely cut stuff with
that and you also get an edge here also
pretty sharp it feels like a cheap
plastic spoon and on the back is a
mirror so you can do some signals
with Morse code or check out how your
camera looks
and right here is a capacitive gesture
area
okay the whole screen is capacitive
we've also got 256 megs of ram and eight
gigs of rom capacity of course you got
the regulars like Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
and let's see if we can get under the
battery
it's kind of hard to open
when they're yeah so here's underneath
the battery cover right now I have the
touchstone cover such as kind of a soft
touch and magnetic battery charging
there's the little of connections for
the battery charger and this is a 1150
milliamp battery and there we are as the
hardware looks a lot like the original
HTC touch you know very simple flush
screen lack of buttons compare that to
the treo pro everything is right here
hardware buttons this is a very similar
the default backing is almost exactly
like this shiny plastic a lot of
similarities there in your hand the pre
nice and small very rounded feels
similar to the treo pro let's take a
look at the size of fries a little bit
thicker than the treo pro but also
shorter and closed when opened we have a
much longer and you have a nice curve to
that slide too
here it is with the t-mobile g1 see the
pre is much more compact it is with the
fuse
again the pre is a nice size and finally
the diamond supre has very nice rounded
edges
it's a little thicker than the diamond
so that's it for the hardware tour stay
tuned for more with chronicles over
windows mobile user gone palm pre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
