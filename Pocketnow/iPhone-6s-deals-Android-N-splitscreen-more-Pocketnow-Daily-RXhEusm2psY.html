just reached their party retailers a
future version of Android is in the
works with split-screen multitasking and
Tim Cook has just decided to defend his
weird iphone battery case I'm hi meri
behna and after a very crazy week I'm
sure you guys understand why i love
friday so much this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with
tmobile as the company's john ledger is
clearly out to make a dent in the market
particularly now with verizon as the
company has a just launched this new
deal where a verizon customers switch
the t-mobile they'll be getting a full
year off hulu in addition to fifty
percent off accessories of whatever
product they buy great deals in all it's
just that the network comparison between
verizon and t-mobile is sort of abysmal
and speaking of sweet deals those of you
in the market for an iphone or an ipad
you should visit your local best buy as
the company is offering 125 dollars off
select ipad models and then a hundred
dollars off iphones if you buy them off
contract which is definitely a sweet
deal if you're looking for options to
pay the same amount of money for more
storage but then again that's just cool
that these deals are available for Apple
products when that's really not common
at all and since we're talking about
Apple let's continue with some news
regarding the iphone battery case that a
lot of people consider to be pregnant
Tim Cook was recently on record talking
about doesn't according to him the
reason why it's designed this way is
because it was the only way for you to
be able to fit your phone in and out in
an easier way as if other competing
companies aren't already doing this for
a lot less money and in a more elegant
way but then again hey if you want that
Apple tax and the apple logo in the back
this is the way to go if you just bought
a new Apple TV or are in the market to
buy one because of that revolutionary
cable subscription services being
rumored it seems you're gonna have to
wait a lot for it we've got trusted
sources claiming that Apple's place this
on mothballs because cable wants to
continue being cable what they want to
do is if you want to watch hbr you have
to pay more for it if you want to watch
these sports cable networks you're going
to have to pay more for them and
obviously it makes a service more
convoluted and obviously more confusing
just ask cable currently
is so it seems that Apple still wants to
negotiate things the way they want it
where you just pay one fee and it makes
all the sense in the world and i know
this drama is just the crazy let's see
how it ends and finally the very hot
news today come officially from google
as one of the company's executives has
just teased the feature things that are
coming with Android n which is obviously
slated until next year but for those of
you that are complaining that the Google
pixel see is gorgeous but there is no
split-screen multitasking well he was
recently asked about this and even
though he didn't confirm anything he
pretty much said that it will be
launched with Android and or that at
least the company is working on it and
this is Major it's something that we've
been waiting for for a very very long
time as phones get bigger and his
Android tablets don't find a placement
but it leads me to the question of the
day is split-screen multitasking an
important feature that you would want on
your next android phone or tablet in my
case i would want them in both I feel
that it's essential that leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion bren-ji know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video was filmed we should follow
us on talking about common subscription
channel as well and follow me on twitter
