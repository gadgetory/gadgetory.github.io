specs that we should see for the next
generation iPhones I'll teach the prizes
us with a few new launches ahead of
Aoife now focused on Android one and the
poco phone f1 is now extending to sixty
more countries yeah that's really good
I'm hanging that Rivera reporting from
our hotel from an ephah I apologize for
the lighting and it's very gloomy but
this is parking out daily powered by
qualcomm the official news today begin
with the poco phone f1 for those of you
that were surprised over that Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 and all those great
specifications on that new attempt from
Xiaomi it's no longer exclusive to India
if you want that phone it has just
expanded to 60 more countries and well
so far our experience Jules is really
impressed I oh my god I can't wait to
get my hands on one now for those of you
that had set your calendars for October
3rd it seems that it's now gonna be more
like October 9th we're not exactly sure
the palm is but apparently Google has
found some hurdles in the production of
the pixel 3 pixel 3 XL it could be that
stolen shipment that I still feel is not
stolen or whatever the case may be but
yeah it seems that we'll be seeing some
sort of the Lay's I hope that doesn't
mean manufacturing delays that will end
up making us get the phone really late
now let's talk about LG as we've been
discussing what the LG the 40 looks like
we've seen CAD renders of three cameras
in the back two Possible's in the front
so scratching our heads over the
possibilities of what but for those of
you that want to see like dimensions
like how much the camera lens protrudes
from the chassis and this and that
there's a whole list of specifications
in the description
it looks enticing particularly because
apparently it will bring a notch but it
probably will not like there are some
polarizing rumors there now let's
continue talking about LG the company
has just surprised us with two new g7 s
yes two new LG G sevens but this time
they're not the typical LG phones that
were used to whereas the g7 fit for
example is a powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 one in addition to
premium mid-range ER specs and then we
have the LG G seven one which follows on
the fact that apparently it doesn't
bring the whole use
interface that we're used to seeing from
the you know LG and instead it's powered
by Android one so no bloatware the only
problem is is qualcomm snapdragon a 35
and i'm not saying this is a bad
processor the specifications are sadly
not on par with what you get with the LG
g 7 thank you and we're wondering
exactly what the whole point is but
we'll keep you posted
we'll definitely be reporting from here
and Aoife and finally the hottest news
today have to do with the iPhones iPhone
10s or tenner iPhone which I assume will
be the entry-level model we hear that
whelming shikoh is now chiming in on
specs starting with the fact that we're
gonna get stainless steel and all that
displays on the premium ones and then
the other one is going to be aluminum
color options will be five for the
aluminum model and then just three for
the stainless steel models we hear
storage options 64 gigs of storage and
256 though there are rumors that there
will apparently be a 512 gig of storage
variant four gigs of RAM in the case of
the premium ones three gigs on the other
one now probably the most interesting
part is that cameras don't change a lot
of other specifications remain the same
with this iPhone so in today's question
let us know what do you think I mean do
you think that Apple could just continue
doing the same thing for another year
particularly in the case of cameras I
don't think that the iPhone 10 has the
best camera in the world for its price
tech that's just me leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion we'd also love to ask you to
stay up to the end of this video for a
word from our sponsor that allows this
video to be possible this episode of the
pocket out daily is sponsored by
Qualcomm these days no one likes waiting
in lines and traffic or when you're on
your phone trying to download something
from the internet that is so annoying
well according to Okla over a million
real-world user tests show that Android
phones with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
provide faster data speeds than phones
with Intel based modems on AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile it's true check out the link in
the description below to learn more
about why the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 is
so much faster friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
talking now about Connors description
both our channels English and Spanish
for more videos like this one you can
follow me on twitter hi manager squad on
instagram at high metal Iveta please
