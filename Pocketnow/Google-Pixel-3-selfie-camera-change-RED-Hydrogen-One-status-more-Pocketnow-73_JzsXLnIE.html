bringing a better selfie camera
experience with some significant changes
iPad pro design changes could have been
confirmed with some new cases as they
always do and red the hydrogen one has
now been showed off by the company CEO
in photos I'm high metal Iveta and you
want to hear a joke
that's me celebrating every Friday and
then ending up working every weekend
this is Parnell Daly let's begin today
with deals the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is
out final software arrived today for our
review unit so expect our review very
soon just running some final tests for
those of you interested there are
discounts everywhere buy one get one
free deals from AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon there
are cases like for example Walmart and
Best Buy where I believe they have it
$200 off and then t-mobile has it 50%
off obviously there are a ton of catches
here but for those of you interested it
is a great phone expect our review soon
you can learn more about everything in
the description now let's talk about the
red hydrogen 1 the phone that we were
supposed to be getting now and it turns
out that we might not get into until
November there are some sort of
certification delays and I almost got
stuck there but the most important part
is that the company CEO just showed it
off in press material we have
photographs now of what to expect and
not just dummy explanations hopefully
this phone pans out to be everything
that's been said because wow that's one
delay now you know that the coolest part
is when case makers get a hold of
prototypes of whatever product is gonna
be launched soon and the iPad pro is the
case we were a little skeptical over the
leaks of the design change of everything
going vertical and the smart connector
going at the bottom but once case makers
get their hands on something it's pretty
much a reality and apparently yes the
smart connector is now moving to the
bottom it means that whatever
accessories you bought for your iPad pro
won't work with this one stay tuned for
that one now let's talk about the Opel
r17 pro as we've got some renders of the
phone and Wow there are just so many
reasons why we're covering this this
cold teardrop design of the display that
we saw with the Oppo f9 that's right
there
ready for review very soon well it's
coming too
vevo it's coming to the Oppo r7 teen Pro
and then the back we see triple cameras
which we discussed yesterday as part of
the news now apparently we get renders
that prove it we hear Gorilla Glass six
great specifications this is a product
that I'm looking forward to
and finally the hottest news that they
have to do with the Google pixel 3 pixel
3 Excel no mission impossible leaks now
instead we hear the purpose of that huge
huge notch at the front apparently these
two cameras here are going to bring us
now super selfies where one of them is a
wide-angle and then the other is a
regular angle camera more like what we
saw with the LG v10 I guess but
apparently there will be other software
algorithms that will enhance the selfie
experience even further which comes as a
such an interesting change and today's
question let us know what do you think I
mean do you think that really it's
better to invest on a better selfie
experience than the primary cameras at
the back as in my case I will tell you
this much the pixel 2 was probably one
of the best cameras I've tested the
problem is a lot of the photos seemed
sort of fake great looking sort of fake
so I would prefer definitely some more
realism but everywhere not just the
front leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
