calm and today i'm going to show you
handy assistant and what this is going
to do is going to allow you to change
different profiles for different times
of the day so let's say you were in a
meeting and your phone starts to ring
well it's pretty embarrassing when your
phone rings in the meeting and your boss
is like who is that what is that so this
will allow you to change your profile
automatically so the first thing we go
into is actually the profile and if I
was in a meeting as you can see it says
meeting manual I can change this and
activate it what that's going to do is
going to change as you can see it
changed the icon up here to vibrate so I
can go into my setting so I've want a
good so this allows me have different
people and contact categories so let's
say I wanted my family to be able to get
ahold of me if I was in a meeting so I
can change the rules for them and I can
say accept calls go done and as you can
see there under the accept calls thing
so if I want to change it for my friends
can go into menu change rule and just
say reject calls and send SMS message
and if I wanted to say this one right
here I can select this template that
I've already created select that and it
will put them in this reject calls and
send SMS message so right there it was
actually a calendar event so we'll go
back to done and if you see the calendar
events it'll say auto so I've select
that because I'm saying that I'm in a
movie right now and if you've ever been
in a movie and your phone has gone off
it's pretty embarrassing so if I select
activate it'll automatically tie in with
my calendar so that's pretty neat it can
also change the sound options so if I
wanted to change the options for this
calendar events profile I can change the
ringer down to zero and put my phone on
to vibrate so that's nice click done and
when you're all done with all of your
meetings sleep work whatever you can
just click deactivate but i don't really
like this icon right here for roaming so
i'm going to change that
let's say when i'm roaming i will want
to play tennis something who knows and
it'll change the icon so i can just
activate the spare time which is what I
mountain right now and click OK another
cool feature about this program is if
someone calls you that you don't want to
talk to you can put them in the black
list and this will reject all the calls
that they've tried to call you from so I
don't really have anyone in there
because it's not really know what I want
to don't want to talk to you but I was
click OK you can also look at your call
log and I'll show you all the incoming
calls unknown calls calls from your
contacts as well as outgoing and missed
calls so click OK another cool feature
about this program is it will record any
call that you're in so when your dial
call it'll actually start recording and
you can even hear button clicks and
everything anything that goes to the
microphone you'll hear recorded or
anything that comes back through the
speaker you'll hear recorded so I've got
a couple ones here this is just me
calling my voicemail so if you can hear
it let's see
it's pretty quiet but that's okay so
what does it stop and it's pretty nice
because it actually automatically
records every single phone call that you
talk to and to get it to stop you have
to push don't record when you're in the
calls when you're on a call so we'll go
into how it looks when you're back to
your today screen it'll automatically
tie in to your actual phone dialers so
if I click dial it'll show the Handy
assistant dialer right here and that's
neat you can also change that in the
settings so if I go back I can change
that under options oh say okay go under
settings and application settings and I
can use the phone dialer or I can use
the program dialer so I have it set to
program dialer right now can also change
the voice recording area so wherever you
wanted to record it will select a file
where it will record to so just select
the cancel and you can also change your
wave rate so this is handy assistant and
it works on any windows mobile 5.0
standard or professional and i'll post a
link and parking out calm as to how to
get this the program does cost twenty
nine ninety five but as useful as it is
and to save you some embarrassment i
think it's well worth it thanks for
