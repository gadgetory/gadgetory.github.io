whose only major crime was looking like
an iPhone okay a lot like an iPhone I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our video review of the HTC One a9
there's no getting around it the HTC One
a9 is a dead ringer for Apple's iPhone 6
from the camera module design to the
medium radius corners to the flat back
and front with rounded edges to the
inlaid antenna bands that HTC introduced
but Apple made famous is really no
denying HTC has sacrificed a legacy of
unique design in order to produce an
iPhone clone that's the bad news the
good news is if you disagree or you just
don't care about that this is a
staggeringly good Android handset with
an impressive price to match the one a9
comes in three shades of aluminum with
either a white or black faceplate
protected by Gorilla Glass 4 as we
mentioned in our hands-on video HTC has
gone far afield of its previous designs
here eliminating all hard edges and
putting its focus back on the details
like a power standby button that's so
heavily textured that you can't possibly
confuse it with the volume rocker the
phone is about as tall as the one m9 it
replaces but it's much thinner and
lighter and that plus the new rounded
finish makes it feel much smaller in the
hand
HTC did eliminate the grippy finish from
the m9 though so the a9 is just as
slippery as most other aluminum phones a
capacitive fingerprint scanner doubles
as a home key to wake up the device in
keeping with most current biometric
sensors it's quite fast and accurate and
it's augmented not by capacitive keys
but instead by software buttons on its
5-inch display this display breaks from
long HTC tradition in that it uses
AMOLED technology instead of super LCD
with the resulting higher contrast and
saturation that we've come to know and
love and it also sticks with Full HD
resolution at 5 inches that makes for a
plotter high pixel density of 440 PPI so
while we're making iPhone comparisons we
may as well point out that in both of
those metrics the one a9 beats apples
so-called Retina display on the success
running on that screen is Android
marshmallow underneath HTC Sense 7.0 you
can find our full impressions of
marshmallow in our Nexus 6p review over
at Pocket now as far as Sense goes HTC
says it's committed to slimming down its
software layer this year but even if it
hadn't we'd probably have few complaints
unlike some third-party interfaces Sense
has a unified look and feel that
complements Android quite well and it
doesn't impair androids smooth flow the
one a9 s software experience is as
buttery smooth as you could ask for
HTC's housecleaning has reduced the
number of duplicate features and apps
but the high points of sense are still
here and there's still really nice
blinkfeed does a nice job aggregating
social and news feeds into one single
stream list you can still wake the phone
using a variety of taps and swipes if
you don't want to use the fingerprint
scanner the lockscreen will still let
you know about local dining
opportunities at mealtimes if you wanted
to and you can change the look and feel
of the entire phone by applying a theme
if anything
HTC was a little too aggressive in
chopping away at sense useful shortcuts
like the notification shade toggle are
gone now the upside to this is that all
those little trims and tucks should help
HTC deliver on its promise of speedy
Android updates specifically updates
delivered no more than 15 days after
Google releases them HTC says it spent
more time and effort than ever before to
build a solid camera here this is a 13
megapixel sensor with an F 2.0 aperture
and it brings oh is back to the 1 family
for the first time in two generations
the viewfinder now has a full pro
shooting mode with raw support as for
the photos if you're given enough light
in color the one a9 is capable of
pictures ranging from pretty to quite
beautiful but that's the case with
essentially every smart phone camera
these days in ideal conditions you
basically can't miss so if you're
shooting is confined to Instagram
Facebook and snapchat posts hey you'll
be fine with the one a9
you've got shooting with this phone in
one hand and the Nexus 6p and another
we're hard-pressed to find any example
where HTC outperforms where the other
phone can pull quite a bit of light from
the darkness the one a9 struggles to
produce anything worthwhile in some
nighttime scenes with a little more
light the one a9 can sometimes kick out
a photo with substantially better color
reproduction but those occasions are far
from the norm in general the a9 s photos
are too noisy with too little dynamic
range its focus is too slow to keep up
with moving subject and all these
problems just get worse
the dimmer the light gets in video mode
which maxes out at 1080p optical
stabilization does a good job of
smoothing the footage without requiring
cropping and while there's a little bit
of focus hunting at times it's not too
bad again what kills this for us is
excessive digital noise and flat color
reproduction which often makes a scene
look dead these are complaints which
also extend to the ultra pixel shooter
on the front side by the way though here
at least HTC gets to bring its low-light
prowess to bear for brighter folks HTC
gets to make up some ground here the
battery is tiny for an Android flagship
but between marshmallows power saving
features and HTC zone optimizations
we're usually able to make it through a
day of moderate use with almost 4 hours
of screen on time to report of course
any kind of heavy usage will require you
to top-up throughout the day but the
quick charge 2.0 compatibility makes
charge times very fast and they'll get
even faster when HTC enables quick
charge 3.0 with a software update
sometime after release the fact that HTC
doesn't include a 3.0 compatible charger
in the box is evidence of corner cutting
and maybe that's also responsible for
the use of the snapdragon 617 processor
instead of something a little more
high-end but the 6 17 is what enables
that superfast charging and though
dedicated gamers might be able to tell
the difference in performance between
the a9 and a higher-end device we
certainly can't really what we miss more
are the boom sound speakers that lone
bottom firing driver is nothing special
and neither is noise cancellation the a9
had
have time eliminating train station
announcements in the background while we
were carrying out a phone call but those
cut corners allow for a competitive
price point at least in North America
the one a9 will sell for 399 in the US
in just one configuration a 32 gig model
with three gigs of RAM and microSD
expansion that's a lot of phone for 400
bucks and when you factor in the
excellent build quality and software
experience it makes for quite a
compelling package there are other
worthwhile contenders in the same
segment of course the Moto X pure
Edition and oneplus 2 come to mind but
those are for people who want huge
phones the one a9 is a more delicate
alternative for someone who wants the
high-end feel of an iPhone and the
flexibility of Android and a sensible
price well it's unfortunate that HTC
chose to sacrifice its proud design
legacy the result is an Android
smartphone that's intriguing for many of
the same reasons HTC phones have always
been intriguing beautiful fit and finish
and exquisite attention to detail that's
a pleasure to use as so long as you can
get past that camera stop the presses
the day before this review went live HTC
informed us that the $399 promotional
pricing for the North American one a
nine would end rather sooner than we
expected the actual price which will
take effect November 7th is $499 in the
US that still makes the an ion cheaper
than some of its forerunners on launch
day and it's still significantly cheaper
than the most recent iPhone but it also
means the a9 is now competing for your
dollars with the likes of the excellent
Nexus 6p that doesn't give the Nexus an
automatic win if you have smaller hands
or just different aesthetic preferences
or you like HTC Sense or you like any of
the other value adds that HTC is
bringing to the table well the one a9 is
still the better option for you but it
does make the question of whether you
should buy the a9 over any of the other
phones in its category a little cloudier
needless to say if you really do want
the one a9 and you're seeing this before
November 7th you should head over to HTC
comm sooner
rather than later for much more on the
189 folks check out our written review

social media we're at pocket now and
most channels and I Michael Fisher I met
