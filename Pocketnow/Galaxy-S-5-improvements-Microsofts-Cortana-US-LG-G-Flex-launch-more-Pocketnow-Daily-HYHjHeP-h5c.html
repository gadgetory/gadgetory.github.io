paying 1 billion dollars to attract
Windows Phone OEMs the LG G flex has
become pre-orders in the United States
sort of numbers have already begun of
the Sony Xperia z2 I'm high memory that
I and it's starting to get cold I'll
probably skip a beer and just get some
scotch this is pocket now daily let's
watch lay off with some official news as
print has already begun pre-orders for
the LG G flex first carry in the United
States though obviously not the biggest
one but it turns out for 299 after
2-year contractor 650 without a contract
which is really not crazy you get the LG
G flex in the next coming weeks and you
can expect it in retail as a februari
7th now on another news LG has also
announced the g two and limited edition
red and gold and it's not as glossy as
the black and white models that we had
so let's hope that comes to the united
states as well now it's not about
Samsung as the company is reportedly
working on bringing us better hovering
sensitivity for their galaxy lineup in
2014 this is coming on the galaxy s5 and
the company behind the cysts and nap
takes and apparently we're getting a
better sense for more sensitivity and
even passive s pen input which is
something that I would rather see in
action than really understand but even
though we're getting this in the galaxy
s 5 and galaxy note 4 we just wonder how
much do you actually use hovering
gestures because I turn them all off now
let's talk about Sony those of you
interested in buying the Sony Xperia z1
I think you should probably wait as we
get new reports of the Sony Xperia z2
being announced at mwc in the next
couple of weeks which we will be there
covering live we are getting a beefier
processor more RAM and just about
everything a bigger screen as well but
the biggest question aside from android
4.4 kitkat is how Wells the Sony plan to
differentiate this phone aside from the
fact that it needs a US carrier so stay
tuned for that and see what we get
that's how about Microsoft has a lot of
us are becoming impatient with Windows
Phone 8.1 it hasn't been released yet we
get more reports on what to expect for
their voice assistant we know it's going
to be called Cortana we know it's based
on halo but now apparently we're getting
the voice of one of these halo
characters to service Cortana which is
an interesting report since I don't know
any other way that curtain should work
but apparently that's what we're getting
we just don't know it
actly when you'll be able to see this
we're expecting a demo at MWC 2014 so
cross your fingers and finally for the
interesting news of the day Microsoft
has decided to come clear about all the
rumors of them spending a billion
dollars to attract OEMs for windows
phone 8 it turns out Frank Shaw just
came on Twitter for Microsoft saying no
they haven't spent that much amount of
money even though they bought Microsoft
all they've done is coming to these
contractual marketing agreements which
do make sense even though Microsoft's ad
company is terrible but anyways that
leads you to the question of the day why
do you think that Windows Phone has
taken so long to take off with so much
money being dumped into the platform in
my particular case honestly everybody
that I asked about Windows Phone what
did I think they find a daunting they
don't like it and we could see that in
Windows 8 a lot of people don't like the
Metro UI tell you why as a minimalistic
and beautiful as Microsoft wants you to
believe it is and I know a lot of us
like it I like it but a lot of people
don't be average user don't so leave us
a comment down below why do you think
this is and friends you know the drill
