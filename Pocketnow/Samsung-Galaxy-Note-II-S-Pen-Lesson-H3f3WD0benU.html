pocketnow.com we wrapped up the AT&amp;amp;T
hands-on event last night in New York
City I decided to come out into the
country for the weekend but before we
get to relaxing which will not be on
camera
want to do a little bit more play with
the the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
specifically want to talk a little bit
about the stylus and all the cool things
we can do with it I'm going to put
together a real quick video to show you
all the functionality of the s-pen as
Samsung is calling it so tune in it's
Michael
pocket now it's the Galaxy Note 2 stylus
lesson S Pen lesson so obviously one of
the differentiating features of the
Galaxy Note 2 is that S Pen which
actually lives in a dock right down here
to the right of the home button if
you're looking at the device from the
front what's nice is as we saw in the
Galaxy Note 10.1 you pull out the S Pen
and when you flip the device back over
it has executed an action that you've
programmed it to take out of the box
this is actually not the default
behavior this is something I've said
I've set it to automatically open s note
but you can hop into the S Pen section
of the settings and actually have the
Galaxy Note 2 do any number of things
when the S Pen is removed so that's
handy right there one of the nice things
about using the S Pen on this display is
that the display will register the S Pen
even when it is not touching the glass
as you can see I'm still hovering over
the glass of the display screen here but
there's I'm not actually touching it and
there's a little indicator on the screen
to show me where the screen thinks the S
Pen is currently living that's very
handy for websites like pocketnow.com
that feature drop-down lists where you
can hover over them without actually
selecting them and you can scroll down
the list that way when you find the item
you want you just tap it to select
that's also handy and applications like
s planner where you can hover over
certain events and get a popover without
actually jumping into the app any
further and also in applications like
messaging where you can hover over a
message to read its contents once again
without actually jumping into the
message itself you might also remember
this functionality from our time with
the Galaxy Note 2 at Aoife in the
gallery here where you can hover over
different albums and have them display
all their photos before you actually
jump into the one that you want and then
of course there's on device video
samsung has thoughtfully provided a very
beautiful video for us to test this
feature on
you can hover in the timeline without
actually jumping ahead in the video find
the area you want then finally select it
but you'll notice here that the s-pen if
we can get focus actually does feature a
button on the side of it there's no
battery inside the s-pen this is a
button that works on magic apparently
whatever the science is if you hold down
the button while tapping on the screen
and holding the device takes a
screenshot instantly pops up that
screenshot then allows you to do things
like crop it edit it and so on of course
capturing screenshots aren't all that
it's good for press and hold the button
once again and just do a vertical swipe
up on the display samsung has provided a
nice quick command feature you can then
draw a symbol much like a shortcut key
on a device with a physical keyboard and
then in this case I did the crosshatch
should open up the dialer and you can
actually well if you're faster than I
was just then you can write out the
number and the dialer will complete the
call for you that is pretty cool it's
not faster in any sense than actually
open up the dialer with your fingers but
it is somewhat cooler and just to be
complete here we'll do a little @ symbol
a very sloppy one and write a recipients
name to send them an email well isn't
that fun what if I wanted to email
Brandon minimun sloppiest handwriting
ever probably not going to work for us
jumping to the email composer
Brandon minimun okay well it didn't
complete the address field but it
definitely did understand what I wrote
baby steps baby steps
one of my favorite shortcuts though with
the Galaxy Note 2 and it's S Pen
functionality is achieved by holding
down the button and double tapping
anywhere it'll pop open an S note as you
can see here and you can instantly take
a note if you want to jot something down
don't forget X whatever you can see my
handwriting has not improved over time
but this is very handy because you can
be anywhere in the device you can be in
the browser once again if we want to hop
in there go on into the right pocket now
reading how the razorium review oh this
is awesome I have to remember to do this
press the button tap tap boom there it
is right there
very handy here's my note saved that is
something I learned last night at the
ATT unwrapped event very helpful Samsung
Repp helped me discover that one and it
was really really really handy has
already come in handy a couple times
today obviously you can move it around
and if you want to cancel you just go
ahead and cancel I've used Samsung S
Memo application and results have been
mixed you can hop on into a note here
and I was having some trouble deciding
exactly how hard I needed to press with
the stylus to get it to register one of
the things that you have to become aware
of is that the S Pen doesn't really
engage unless you feel there's a little
click and you can see that rubber tip
kind of going into the S Pen a little
bit if that doesn't really happen there
is no response from the display so
that's something to keep in mind if
you're thinking you want to do a lot of
featherweight coloring in here you
really it is a very light press I'm not
suggesting up to really press very hard
on it but initially I thought that I
would have a little bit more sensitivity
than we're actually getting from the
device that said once I was done with
all the handwriting experiments I was
able to whip out a fun little drawing of
this planet here which despite the glare
I think you will agree is the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen
nice software touches here make this
look like it's a water color marker that
has soaked into the paper at points and
that has not at others nice little
detail there helps make the experience
just a little bit more fun
as I touched on before there are and in
there is a whole array of spen settings
that you can use to calibrate and change
the behavior of the s-pen as you see fit
you can set your dominant hand between
right and left hand you can set the
sound that the device plays when the S
Pen is removed on or off you can set it
to automatically open the pop up note as
we saw at the beginning of the video
that's how mine is set the pen detection
can be disabled this kind of the the
hovering effect that we demoed before
can be disabled if you want to save
battery life it'll crank down the
sensitivity of the displays I believe
how it's doing that the S Pen keeper is
actually pretty cool that will alert you
if you've removed the S Pen from the
device and then you try and walk away
with the device without the S Pen in its
dock it will use the accelerometer
detect it's moving without the s-pen and
you'll say hey go back and get your
s-pen because they're tough to replace
air view of course you can modify the
the hovering behavior sound and haptic
feedback you can turn on and off quick
command settings we sell those before
and s-pen help which is a series of fun
tutorials Samsung obviously really
really good still including a lot of
tutorials as they did on the Galaxy s3
to help you learn stuff that you do not
already know and just to briefly jump
back into S note here not S Memo as I
called it before sorry there are just a
whole bunch of predefined formats here
this one is called financial information
and if they're essentially just
templates like you might find in a word
processing program that allow you to or
that aim to allow you to make the most
out of these applique out of your S Pen
and the applications that come with them
interestingly as you might see I just
tried to use the S Pen to activate the
capacitive button flanking the home
screen here it does not this is not a
new development it's not news just keep
it in mind you will have to somewhat
clumsily alternate between on-screen
inputs and coming up here with your
finger if you want to activate the back
or menu buttons finally we'll just give
you a real world example of usability on
on the s-pen here you have a look at
Jaime Rivera
email here asking if the Lumia 920 is in
fact 30 grams heavier than the Dell
Venue Pro well we can find that out and
we don't have to do a whole lot of
typing to do it through the magic of
editing I've just hopped on over to
Google here and typed in Lumia 920 wait
we'll wait for the browser to load that
up and we got our answer how much is
Lumia smartphone way Lumia 920 can we
get any of them in these yes wait 185
assume there's a primary source we're
not going to do too much fact-checking
on hi mates behalf circle it while
pressing the button boom there we go
there's our screenshot we hit email
copied to clipboard boom it is inserted
in the email for us and all we have to
do is enter Hymas name send them the
screenshot and it is done no typing
necessary this is also probably a pretty
good opportunity to demonstrate the
handwriting recognition more on this
once again in our full review see if we
can get our focus back doing the best I
can
boom it has auto-completed up here we
hit it there it is send he's going to
get that with no context at all and you
know that'll be alright
and of course though this is not going
to be news to many folks at the end of
the day you're done using the s-pen you
pop it right back in the doc phone gives
you a little haptic buzz to let you know
that it knows that the s-pen has been
replaced and you are free to use your
fingers about the interface that's going
to do it for the Galaxy Note 2 S Pen
lesson I hope you learned some things
that you didn't know before and
hopefully you can teach me something I
didn't know before leave me a comment in
the post at pocketnow.com not here on
youtube we generally don't check those
very often follow us on twitter at
pocket now twice philomene on twitter at
captain two phones stay tuned for a lot
more a Galaxy Note 2 coverage as we
continue getting our hands all over this
device learning everything there is to
learn about it and of course our full
review coming a little bit later on next
week thanks everyone for watching throw
us a thumbs up if you liked the video
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
