calm and we are going to try to do a
side-by-side comparison between the
first beta of Windows Phone mango on
this device and the second beta a bonus
one mango over here let's check it out
first off we're going to try to turn
them on at the same time the dell is
generally a little bit slower booting up
anyway so i want to compare this for a
speed sake but we can see a little
difference in what comes up there's a
square logo now as you're a circular
logo but this totally beat the old beta
so there's your a speed increase this
one seems to be a little bit faster with
the scrolling
alright let's take a look at some of the
other things people a slightly different
animation there let's try that again
and hitting this start button we get
some animation back here but it's still
the same speed so that's pretty cool
meat aisle we now have twitter on this
one so if i post a message i can choose
any of these and will now work or is
over here it just wouldn't work because
it didn't have something at twitter
sport set up over there and you get
Twitter notifications over here let's
see if i can reply to one
so there's a mention and i can send that
i can also tap and hold this one copy it
and paste it right there so that's a way
to do your old style retweeting zoom in
a little bit on that so that's pretty
cool you also have the new retweet
button here that's the gist automatic
retweet without any editing so that's
possible and in your pupil hub we are
going to find all sorts of twitter
updates so you can see those and we can
filter it we'd see just Twitter and they
are
one issue is if I go to let's see if I
go to contacts so I'm going to filter my
contact list to just show linkedin and
twitter people look what happens there's
nobody there so at least in this build
at this time it does not sink Twitter
people or LinkedIn contacts to your
contacts listing and that is problem
because say I want to go to a group none
of these people are going to have their
twitter updates show up here because
they don't have there's no way to link
them to their Twitter accounts or
LinkedIn account so none of that is
going to appear in groups or if you go
to a specific person and go to their
specific what's new feed none of their
twitter updates are going to show up
there either so that's unfortunate we
also have a new voicemail feature
Oh Park Zuni we add new buttons when you
tap the voicemail to play as opposed to
just the play button over here we don't
have voicemail support on this account
anymore okay I said dismiss but there's
new buttons that make easier to call
back this person or go directly to their
contact card
maps if I do directions unfortunately
you're still going to have to do the
tapping each time in order to get the
voice prompts
and it's having issues because we're
indoors so you will take my word for
that and the icon here has been changed
a little bit
we also see the icon has changed in the
music hub previously it was a play
button that would play music you can see
the little note there says play music
now it's a musical notes button then
also does the same thing but is a much
harder to understand what that is
actually going to do until you flip up
to read it so we got rid of the good
play button that was up here before and
now we have a little play button and now
we have something that is completely
understandable one thing I was hoping
for was a share update so if I gotta
share music there is no Twitter or
Facebook option so I was hoping for that
but we don't have that
there is however let's find a picture
we share a picture over here email
message in facebook SkyDrive Twitter and
the same as over here but now toward it
works
so there you go you can share photos on
Twitter that's a nice new feature
one more thing
I have a mp3 file here click it over
there too
we're now streaming that music pop you
can see it's downloading it right there
there's the progress bar so that's
pretty cool you can have some music on
your sharepoint storage or your SkyDrive
and you can just stream it whatever you
want
here's another issue I want to check out
can't edit word 97-2003 documents on the
original windows phone 7 you could edit
these but that feature has been removed
and it's still not working so that's
unfortunate
one more thing let's find my test file
we still do not have ink support
attachments there it's still sinking
and writing doesn't work videos do work
audio recordings to work equations don't
work shape dryness don't work so no new
updates in the OneNote support
bean hasn't changed much we still have
all the cool features there
and that's about it for what has changed
in the new beta slot faster smoother
I've got some slightly different
animations so pretty cool that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
