a while ago we did a review first boot
an initial impressions video on the HTC
Desire HD and it just came out miserably
the reason behind that is the screen on
the desire HD is just so ridiculously
reflective that it really didn't matter
what kind of lighting setup I tried to
throw at it it always had reflections
now a lot of that was my fault in the
way that I typically like my videos and
some of that was a new tripod set up
that I had going on that I didn't
realize was causing a problem until
after so what I'd like to do is go back
and show you again the initial first
boot and so I've gone ahead and factory
reset the phone and let's go ahead and
look at that now okay so what I'm done
is I've gone ahead and done a factory
reset on the HTC Desire HD and hit the
power button which is up here at the top
of the phone and this is the initial
boot first of all you get a field of
light with the HTC logo in the middle
and a vibration to tell you that the
phone is powering up from there you get
the HTC quietly brilliant animation and
I'm going to call that their trademark
sound and then it'll wait on this screen
for a few seconds now while you're doing
this remember that first boots and
initial boots usually take longer than
other boots and of course we're not
talking about just sleeping the phone by
hitting the power button and turning the
screen off we're talking about actually
physically powering it down like you do
if you remove the battery or if you
completely ran out of power and had to
reboot the phone from a cold State so
this screen right here usually stays for
about 30 to 45 seconds again depending
on when you recently booted it up now
this phone does include something called
fastboot on in all honesty I didn't see
much with that I'll see if I can show
you something here regarding that
fastboot where basically it writes the
current state into memory so it can boot
up faster it's kind of like a
hibernation rather than a boot but again
I didn't see much difference here like
some other people have been noticing so
we've gone ahead and got to our lock
screen
and I don't have my sim card in it at
this time so let's unlock this and we're
back to the HTC logo screen which is a
little bit unusual for an initial boot
sequence you'd expect once you unlock to
go right into your into your desktop and
be able to look at your launcher screens
this will stay here for another several
seconds and from that point it will
start to paint the desktop for us okay
so what we've got is the setup and
configuration screen this is not an
American phone this is a European and an
asia-pacific phone so you don't have
American English in the list that's okay
i can understand queen's english so
we're going to select english united
kingdom and say next okay it tells you
how to remove the backplate and how to
put the sim in which is really neat that
you know the phone is telling you this
is how you do it just in case you don't
know because this is a different way of
of a phone manufacturer doing it I
haven't seen anyone do that partial
removal of the the back with a cover
tells you how to use the on-screen
keyboard and the keyboard that it comes
with is the HTC ime which is a very nice
keyboard it's not quite as nice as skype
which the phone does not ship with but
it is a little bit nicer than the stock
android keyboard we'll skip that
tutorial it wants me to transfer my data
via bluetooth so that I if I've got an
older phone i can transfer over contacts
and texts and whatnot via bluetooth so i
can start using this phone right away
that's a very nice thing that i haven't
seen in any other phones where it says
hey this is your new phone let's get the
stuff off of your old phone to make
things easier next it wants me to set up
an intricate internet connection i want
to be able to use my mobile network or
Wi-Fi now over here I'm limited to edge
only when I have a sim in because of the
bands that the phone uses whether you're
on t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T or a similar carrier
that uses the same bands you're only
going to get edge not 3g unless you are
over in Europe or or Asia or England or
somewhere over there
has those different bands where you go
ahead and say next okay how do we want
to sync well we want it to automatically
sync rather than manually sync which is
the default will say next and then ask
me if I want to set up a Wi-Fi network
and very quickly finds my network right
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and take this off
camera really fast and type in that
access key now the keyboard that it
comes with lets you do both if I can
type it lets you do both letters and
numbers on the same keyboard which is
really nice you don't have to switch
between views to be able to do it it
does however take a little bit more time
because you have to long press on the
key to be able to make it be a number
instead of a letter and I think I got
that right and it says it's connecting
and you have no idea how hard it is to
type that in while also talking now I've
got a check mark over here if I wanted
to add other networks I can do that at
the same point but we're good I'm going
to say next I'm going to choose to let
Google know my location next and if I
wanted to set up an HTC Sense account I
could now HTC Sense is not only the UI
but there's also a website now called
HTC Sense calm which is really kind of
cool it's a way to help unify all of
your contacts whether their Facebook
Twitter of course you're your google
contacts and any other context that you
get on your phone and synchronize their
information all together by linking them
through this common service it's really
easy to set up an account and there's
lots of other stuff that that the
website does including the ability to
locate your phone and whatnot so it's
really kind of cool to see HTC getting
into the services industry rather than
just the the handset industry so kind of
neat i'm going to skip the setup for
right now and continue on through the
process at this point i can set up my
google account my exchange account or
some other email account again we'll
skip that because you've seen that
before
it wants me to linked with facebook
flickr and or twitter very easy to do
that and then at this point because i
don't have a sim in here it wasn't able
to get the date and time and time zone
from my carrier so it wants me to
manually provide that we're just going
to accept the default and finish that
that would all be automatic if your
carrier provides that and i don't know
of a carrier that that doesn't provide
that service anymore so what it's doing
is it's taking that information and the
reason why you go through that first and
foremost rather than getting the desktop
right away is sense is very very much a
social interface if you will and this is
kind of dark on screen for you so let's
go ahead and bump the display all the
way up to maximum so you can see a
little bit better say ok on the m back
home so what do I mean by a social thing
well you've got all these really cool
widgets and I wish that these widgets
were available for for the stock
launcher other people are trying to do
that but HTC really has an advantage
with having their sense UI being the
launcher in that they can have these
widgets that are scrollable you can
scroll up and down it's not just a
static view or a timed rotation view you
can actually scroll through them and
those of you who have seen since you I
in the past know what I'm talking about
so you can do stuff like friend stream
now this is a stream of all of your
friends activities from all the networks
that you have subscribed you can easily
go over and launch into the full app and
see everything you've got there I don't
have anything so of course it wants me
to sign in we'll just go back away from
that here you've got your text message
widget it's just that unfortunately i
don't use text messaging i use google
voice for text messaging and it does not
tie in with that so usually remove that
widget loading up whether this is
probably one of the cooler things about
the device you've got this weather thing
it knows where I am based on my
geolocation and it says and then of
course this is all Celsius it knows what
my weather is what the forecast is and I
can refresh it from there but it also
exposes that
right here on the flip clock and this
flip animation is really cool i love it
again sense UI has just lots of spit and
polish that i really like but when you
get weather changes you'll have weather
animating across the screen and it's
kind of really cool it gets right in
your face and lets you know hey you've
got some weather going on it's starting
to rain or starting to get windy or
whatever so that you're prepared when
you go out of that office building
outside you know what kind of whether to
expect so kind of cool so overall not
bad let me show you really quick the way
that you add widgets because I think
sense UI does a really good job of this
to or anything not just widgets let's go
ahead and add the calculator so I opened
up the drawer which is this button over
here I'm going to long press on
calculator and now if you look it's got
this little green outline around where I
can drop it so let's go ahead and put
that there and now let's put a widget in
and we'll just you know add a normal
widget and in this case hey how about a
calculator widget and we'll select that
one I don't have enough room on the
screen so let's select a smaller one how
about the FM radio widget again that
one's too big see what else we can find
here we go let's choose the market
widget and it goes up there now when you
press and move around can you see that
that great out area around the screen
that shows you what part of the screen
is occupied by a widget and it lets you
know I can't drop it over here because
great out so it's kind of nice to help
you know where you can drop widgets and
if you're not familiar with with Android
or or or making screens look the way
that you want them to this is a really
really nice user interface element to to
show people hey this is how you do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
