Nexus name we typically consider them to
be iterative updates of one another each
building on the success of the one that
came before Google decided to change
things up a bit last year by releasing
the Nexus 6 a phablet thankfully this
year Google returned the Nexus to its
roots by releasing the Nexus 5x how does
it stack up against the original Nexus 5
from two years back let's dive right in
to begin with the original Nexus 5 and
the Nexus 5x are remarkably similar in
terms of overall dimensions this year's
version is slightly taller and barely
wider than the original it's also a
little slimmer and a smidgen heavier
some of that weight can be attributed to
the battery which is 400 milliamps
larger in the new phone and unless
you've got both of them in hand probably
never notice the difference where you
might notice the differences in the
shape the original Nexus 5 had gently
curved top and bottom edges whereas the
new one is much more square sure the
corners are nice ly radiused but the
elegant curve of the original is gone
instead elegant curves surround the
camera ah the camera back in 2013 Vic
Gundotra said Google was committed to
making Nexus phones quote insanely great
cameras we thought that was going to be
in the original Nexus 5 but despite
getting an update that addressed camera
performance the Nexus 5's 8 megapixel
camera didn't live up to its potential
or Tuvix promise the laser autofocus
twelve point three megapixel shooter on
the Nexus 5x on the other hand performs
admirably well despite not having OIS
which ironically the original Nexus 5
did it performs well in both bright
light as well as low-light situations
though we're hoping the 5x gets an
update to its camera to help fix the
sluggishness and cannot connect errors
that many 5x owners are reporting
it should be obvious that the original
Nexus 5 didn't ship with Android 6.0
marshmallow but thanks to an OTA update
that's what it's running now just like
the new 5x marshmallow has a lot going
on under the hood to help the Android
operating system look and perform
smoother than previous versions one
could assume that the extra smoothness
would require more RAM a faster
processor and even a better graphics
chip while all those are present in the
5x the original Nexus 5 2 has remarkably
well with marshmallow
the original Nexus 5 has a 32-bit
quad-core Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.3
gigahertz compared to the 64-bit
quad-core Snapdragon 808 clocked at 1.4
4 gigahertz but that's teamed up with a
companion dual-core 1.8 to gigahertz
coprocessor both have two gig RAM but
the RAM in the 5x is faster than the
original interestingly enough there are
times when the processor in our Nexus 5x
will max out and cause some serious
hesitation which the original Nexus 5
doesn't seem to exhibit we're not sure
if this is due to the slower clock speed
despite being a more advanced
architecture in the 808 versus the 800
or if it's the handoff from the little
pores to the big cores or maybe even
some other reason that we haven't
discovered yet once the cores in the 5x
are spun up it outperforms the original
Nexus 5 in almost every way but not by
very much the main differences between
the two phones of course and hardware
the original Nexus 5 supports qi
wireless charging in sports a micro USB
port the 5x does away with the
convenience of wireless charging in lieu
of a USB type-c rapid charging both
support Wi-Fi AC and the 5 gigahertz
spectrum and both support LTE though
band support is much better on the 5x
than the 5 bluetooth on the 5x is also
bumped up 4.2 versus 4.0 on the original
also new is the rear-facing fingerprint
reader which serves not only as a power
button to quickly wake your phone but
also as a biometric security mechanism
to unlock the
all at the same time lastly is battery
life as we mentioned in a review of the
Nexus 5x its battery is pretty good
though not great but charging is very
very quick especially from empty the
battery on our original Nexus 5 well it
can't stray far from a charger and it
takes a fair amount of time to top it
off which is at least in part due to the
batteries starting to show its age all
in all the original Nexus 5 has aged
very well
however if you've been holding out the
5x is most definitely a worthy ohh
be sure to check out our full review of
the Nexus 5x as well as our after the
buzz episode number 32 where we took
another look at the original Nexus 5
