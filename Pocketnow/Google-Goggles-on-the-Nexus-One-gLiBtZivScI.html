pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to cover a really cool android
application from google called goggles
we've been working on this for a very
long time and it's not perfect but it
works quite well what it allows you to
do is take a picture of a cover of a
book or a barcode or an electronic
device or a landmark it will use image
recognition to try to figure out what
you've just taken a picture of then it
will do a google search for that item so
let's do it with a let's test it out
with a few different scenarios let's
start off with a barcode I've got a
bottle of windex over here that has a
nice big bar code in the back I'm just
going to kind of position the camera in
front of it make everything steady and
take the picture of the barcode all
right there's the picture and it will
analyze and there we go the first result
is correct multi-surface windex with
vinegar 26 ounces is the 26 ounce yes it
is very nice so it does very very well
with barcodes let's test it with a book
cover so we've got a book here I'm going
to put it sort of up here a little bit
and try to focus the camera just right
let me get it into a portrait there we
go alright so that was a good picture it
should get it there is one up on Wall
Street on amazon.com so you could go
right to that site and buy the book if
you wanted to let's try it with
something else let's make it a little
bit more tricky will try with an HTC
snap so let me try to get this position
properly alright and let's see if it
gets this right it often has a hard time
with devices like this but look it got
it HTC snap links right to the HTC
website so you can get more information
about the snap if you wanted to all
right let's try something else here's a
sony cybershot camera let's see if it
can figure out what this is so we're
going to take a picture hopefully not
get a shadow in there the flash
oftentimes causes a reflection makes it
a little more difficult so I'm assuming
this won't get
right and it didn't it got it totally
wrong let's try something else will take
the HTC hd2 take a picture of that do it
in portrait try to get that get out of
the way so there's no reflection and one
two three okay so a reasonably good
picture of the hd2 let's see if it can
recognize that no no results found with
the hd2 so again googoo babbles works
quite well in a lot of situations I've
taken pictures of like a touch pro 2 and
a touch pro and it has worked you just
have to have the background right and
the the object perfectly in focus in
order it in order for it to work but it
does work extremely well on barcodes
book covers and on landmarks so really
cool application if you android 1.6 or
higher definitely check it out it's free
right now that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
