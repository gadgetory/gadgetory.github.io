camera we are back at the mill kia just
for a quick look and comparison between
a Lumia phone any Lumia phone and a
brand new X and we're going to use the
Excel because they're both yellow let's
go take a look so there's obviously not
too many things to compare here and this
is not the scope of the video we won't
talk about specifications we will talk
about just the looks how Nokia is trying
to bring the live tiles to these pork
tendr√°n operating systems on the X and
of course we have the Lumia 1020 here
which is running Windows Phone 8 soon
8.1 hopefully and the Nokia XL running
that specific Nokia version of AOSP and
we'd open-source project we all know
Windows film by now
it's the Live Tiles which you can resize
and move around and you know what you
can do the same on the nokia X as well
however applications on your Lumia phone
are downloadable from the Microsoft
Store while you will need to go and Matt
nakiya's own store for Android
applications we do not know whether you
will be able to sideload android
applications into the nokia X but
whatever's in the Nokia Store is an
Android app and it will run on the XL we
won't talk about specs Ram hardware
cameras and other because this is the
premium lineup as Stephen Elop mention X
is the mid-range err lineup and the Asha
is the low-end lineup okay it's 109
euros this is above 400 years so what
can we expect we just wish that maybe
this or that would have ran stock
Android this was a very very short look
at all the Lumia compares to the
brand-new nokia X panel behind the
camera evidence on four pocket now thank
you very much for watching till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
