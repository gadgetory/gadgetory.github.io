calm and in this video i'm going to
continue my series of comparing the HTC
evo 4g to the samsung galaxy s however
this time it's going to be all about the
hardware so let's go ahead and jump
right into it alrighty we are back and
one of the first things that i want to
touch on is actually going to be the
screen size of this hardware so
basically the evo 4g which is actually
right here on the left has a 4.3 inch
screen whereas the Samsung Galaxy S has
the four inch screen with that being
said the evo 4g screen is in LCD where's
the Samsung galaxies is a super amoled
so two very different types of screens
there many people have talked about how
the Super AMOLED is a much let's say
clear screen a lot better color
saturation the black levels on the
Samsung Galaxy S and they super amoled
screen are absolutely amazing the screen
definitely looks better than the evo 4g
s some of the colors on the EVO 4g look
a little washed out with that being said
though I I sometimes feel that the
detail on the Super AMOLED is almost too
much I can see some of the grain in the
icons and any little imperfection in
some of the icons and some of the apps
for example the beautiful widgets over
here it's very hard to tell but there's
actually some clipping almost in the art
itself of the numbers so once again you
can see some of the imperfections a
little easier than you would on the EVO
another thing too with the screen size
is I've kind of grown very fond of the
4.3 inch screen for is great for is
bigger than most of the phones out there
like the iphone for example however i
have grown attached to my evo with the
4.3 inch screen it's much easier for me
to text i have a tough time texting on a
capacitive phone you know making little
typos here and there whatever it may be
and i really have an easier time with
the evo 4g texting on that so i have to
say that gets the upper hand for me
there as far as the texting goes but as
far as the screen resolution of the
screen picture the samsung galaxy s is
going to do it now as far as the onboard
memory goes the HTC evo 4g has a strange
number it's 440 megabytes of onboard
storage we know whether it be for music
apps that sort of thing you can also put
up to a 32 gigabyte microSD card
the Samsung Galaxy S is going to come
with 16 gigabytes of on-board storage so
that's a pretty big increase right there
and the same mind day you can use up to
a 32 gigabyte microSD card so this gives
you a little bit more of an option too i
would say increase the size right off
the bat you know you don't really have
to buy the extra memory card if you
don't want to I know for me like I've
put a lot of music on my samsung galaxy
s already stock without a memory card in
there and I've been using that to play
some of my songs now instead of having
to buy a memory card to use an ipod or
whatever it may be now moving on to
what's under the hood of these two
devices this is actually where there's a
lot of debate to be had the processor of
both of these phones is actually a 1
gigahertz processor however they're both
different variants the HTC evo 4g will
use a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor whereas the Samsung Galaxy S
uses a 1 gigahertz Samsung hummingbird
cortex a8 processor so people have been
debating back and forth as of which is
faster than many articles put out lots
of speculation here and there the way it
seems right now the Samsung Galaxy S
does not a faster processor and that
also continues with the GPU the graphics
processor of the Samsung Galaxy
supposedly it actually performs better
than the HTC EVO 4 g's i would say we'll
give it time you know we'll see more
extensive testing coming out and
especially where more and more games are
continually being developed for the
android market we'll see what happens
then what really comes out on top in
terms of the gameplay capability the
frames per second that sort of thing now
both devices can record high-definition
video in 720p the difference is going to
lie in the still picture capabilities
the HTC evo is a a megapixel camera
whereas the Samsung Galaxy S is a 5
megapixel camera i also want to touch on
some of the media capabilities with
these two devices many of you know the
HTC evo 4g has the micro HDMI out port
on the bottom which would allow you to
actually plug this device into a maybe a
receiver or a high-definition TV of some
kind maybe any device that has the hdmi
port samsung galaxy s does not have that
however it is DLNA capable so if you're
on a wireless network you can actually
stream your media to something like that
maybe it's a TV maybe it's a computer I
know some samples
our receivers now have that capability
built right in so that's a pretty cool
feature that we really are starting to
see now in some of the new devices
getting a little up close and personal
with these two devices the HTC evo
weighs six ounces and the samsung galaxy
s weighs four point one six ounces now
I'm actually showing you kind of the
difference in dimensions right here I
won't bore you into getting 22 into
those dimensions but they are somewhat
close i'm just going to show you on the
screen you know rather than reading off
these numbers to you but they gallop see
itself is definitely not as tall as the
HTC evo that being said the width is
very close you can see here what this
very close the fact that this tapers off
they both taper off you know it's a
little bit different with the form
factor but the main thing is for me is
the height I will say though at least
for me the samsung galaxy s feels almost
a little too late almost a little too
plasticky i personally attribute heft
with quality if something's light I'm
not a big fan almost feel like it's been
cheaply made and the samsung galaxy in
my opinion is borderline almost too
light so that's one of the things the
evo has going forward at least in my
opinion is the haves a lot of people
don't like how much this fall in ways
but pay again it's all personal
preference and lastly I do want to do a
screen test between these two phones
outdoors and direct sunlight so that's
going to come right up next let's go
ahead and move on to that alright guys
Rebecca we are now outside and actually
the Sun is directly overhead so this is
pretty much the best test that we're
going to have possible it's a nice hot
day the Sun is directly overhead as you
can see here we have the evo 4g on the
left and the samsung galaxy s on the
right and in terms of the viewing i do
have to say they're they're both fairly
decent in the Sun that's one of things i
do like about the evo was you know i can
see it in the sun whereas before i had
trouble with my nexus one with that
being said once again just like the
samsung wave again it's a little hard to
tell because of the angle here but the
samsung galaxy s is a little easier to
see in the sun i'm just going to try and
hold these up so it's a little bit
easier but again it's it's tough because
of the angling here but if we do go into
the browser for example we can pull up
pocketnow.com and as you can see here
the page itself on the evo
you can actually see the background
better at least in my opinion so in
terms of the browsing with the white
background the evo is actually easier to
see in the Sun you know the screens
bigger which makes it much better might
be something to do with the LCD screen
or the actual white balance itself the
brightness is that full on both of these
devices so there isn't an advantage
there whatsoever but when you're
browsing through the menus I do find
that the evo is a little dimmer or more
I would say more glare because of the
actual Sun itself for example if we go
to the applications menu here little
bitty is your time to see the actual
applications at least from me on the
Samsung Galaxy S but either way they
both work great so I can't complain
there all right and that about does it
for the hardware comparison between the
HTC evo 4g and the samsung galaxy s stay
tuned for my next video which will be
part 2 of the software comparison
between these two devices as always guys
