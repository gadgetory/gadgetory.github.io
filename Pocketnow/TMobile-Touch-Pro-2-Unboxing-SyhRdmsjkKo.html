calm and we've got the new t-mobile HTC
touch pro2 and we're going to unbox it
this is a specially made for t-mobile's
3g network so there we have a nice flap
it's very similar to the dash 3g box so
here's the device and over here for now
over here got our booklets as a screen
cover little tips and tricks getting
started guide let's see what that's like
very nice photos all full-color warranty
CD instructions and applications 60 day
trial about look 2007 go back there and
inside we've got extended USB headphones
the usual extended USB charging sync
cable nice compact charger this piece
seems to come out so you can change it
for other countries very nice that goes
there
and here we have a extended USB adapter
that gives you extend the USB for
headphones 2.5 millimeter headsets 3.5
millimeter headsets and then another USB
headphone port you can use one for
charging work for headphones I guess and
lastly add a little case looks to be
similar to what Brandon's unlock your
opinion touch pro came in schools sleeve
typing and here's our device let's see
how it compares to some of the other
devices let's go for the old tighten too
touch pro bit longer much larger screen
bit thinner and the old Kaiser keyboard
slide up opposite and we both tilt now
touch pro2 soon as I've kind of a click
when it tilts and that click and they
both let's have our mind tilts and you
see keyboard is much wider on the touch
pro too much more spaced out very nice
and you have the touch pro see the touch
pro 2 looks a lot bigger and that's fun
but it looks a little thinner the
original touch pro was very felt very
thick they're here is with the touch HD
this is a dummy phone actually see how
that compares
and the diamond touch pro2 could eat the
diamond and here's the dash 3g also out
on tmobile dash is much thinner much
lighter i'm finally the xperia spear is
much less wide but about the same
thickness so there you have it for now
