aren't there any rugged waterproof
phablets are you a big tough person
doing big tough things and need a big
tough phone that can keep up with you
Kyocera is adding a kaiju of a
smartphone to its lineup this year but
we've got to get it out of the packaging
to see if it can live up to the
marketing claims I'm Juan Carlos bag now
for pocket now and here are my first
impressions of the Kyocera dura force XD
on AT&amp;amp;T GP cricket this thing is big
nothing fancy coming by way of packaging
dura force is an 18 t flavour of Kyocera
so we've got the Sunkist orange box with
a picture of the phone on the front and
what a box it is I mean it has a phone
inside and a battery and a charger and a
USB cable and papers I'm glad we got
this out of the way I'm sorry folks
talking about packaging is just so
underwhelming when we've got this
monster phone to check out Jebus this
thing is a brick now I've seen a lot of
people complaining about the size of the
LG v10 which has a reinforced casing for
milspec 810g drop protection the dura
force XD matches that 5.7 inch screen
size but surrounds that screen in armor
which would embarrass and OtterBox
Defender also milspec a 10 G and ip68
water-resistant meaning you should be
able to dunk it under 6 feet of water
for up to half an hour no joke folks
this beast makes the 6 inch screen - LG
G flex feel petite by comparison hold on
just a sec this is my favorite part of
setting up a new phone oh yeah that's
good
I love peeling that plastic off okay and
playing with the Brigadier in the
original dura force I was seriously
impressed by the scratch resistance of
the Brigadier sapphire crystal screen
but the matte rubber plastic on the door
for seemed like it would H better than
the smooth plastic on the Brigadier
mine's literally all scratched a heck
I'm glad to see Kyocera and ATT have
stayed with a matte rubbery material
adding full leather textured accents at
the top and bottom Samsung introduced
fancy engineering to waterproof the
headphone and USB jacks on the galaxy s6
active and there's nothing that nifty
the XD is all about brute force and
resorts to port covers which include
gaskets to prevent water from leaking in
huge front-facing speakers make a return
but I'll be very curious to see how the
earpiece speaker performs after using
the tissue conduction smart sonic screen
on the smaller dura force the XD has a
legit tough-guy style and happily we can
swap the battery here unlike the
Brigadier the bolt on the back is
actually functional not really this
thing screws and locks the backplate
into the body of the phone it's not just
a gimmicky switch like the loose piece
of metal on the back of my samsung rugby
the battery has a rail built in to
ensure that the whole device stays
contained in the event of a drop now
we've all seen phones fly to pieces back
plates popping open batteries ejecting
but we'll have none of that here thank
you very much hi mate Iveta this battery
is big to a 3700 milliamp hour power
pack which should provide ample runtime
for the low power hardware crammed
inside the screen is one of the brighter
LCDs I've played with the whites are a
bit warm for my taste and the 720p
resolution feels a bit stretched on a
5.7 inch diagonal especially if you've
been spoiled by four times that
resolution over the same service area I
was pleasantly surprised by how quick
this phone fired up on first boot and
there's a helpful little guide to walk
you around some of the features on the
phone after you've put in your Google
account credentials already paging
around the UI it's a bit choppy no
surprise there knowing that the Qualcomm
400 series CPU isn't going to win any
showdowns with other devices around this
$450 price point but that's not really
the point of a Kyocera though is it if
you define power user as bleeding edge
processor tech then this is
automatically the wrong fit for you
however if power user means the ability
to withstand drops and water and a
higher likelihood of surviving explosive
concentrations of flammable gas then
this will be right up your alley I
honestly have no idea how I could
possibly even test for that I'm I'm not
a mythbuster it's built for rugged work
conditions but is it a good fit for
consumers outdoorsy lifestyle folks
parents of precocious kids for all the
regular non-explosive gasps phone
testing and reviewing you can count on
us to put the derp fors XD through its
paces do you have any ideas for how we
might torture
test this phone drop us a comment below
if you come up with something really
creative maybe we can convince our PR
contact to let us do a little gadget
destruction porn
probably not but you never know make
sure you subscribe to see our full
review of the Kyocera der force XD and
hit that thumbs up button to help us out
with a little positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos Becnel and
you can chat me up on Twitter and
Instagram as some gadget guy as always
thanks so much for watching and I'll
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
