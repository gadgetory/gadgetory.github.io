it'll grow in all dimensions apparently
built your Nexus rumors claim a name in
a possible price tag and now it seems
that the new Apple TV won't be as hot as
we thought I'm hi meri behna apologizing
for a recent YouTube issues it's a
YouTube problem but it affects your
viewing experience of our videos this is
fucking out daily if you want to see
official news sadly that'll be for
yesterday's video now Aoife is winding
down when it comes to announcements and
we've got our hands on coverage coming
up so for now the rumors are mainly
based on these products the gear s2
particularly if you want to know the
price tag it seems that it will be
starting at three hundred fifty dollars
extending to four hundred dollars and
then even more depending on whatever
variant it is that you pick so this
seemed that Apple's starting to turn
with this price tag with the Apple watch
and now gear s2 another product other
very interesting rumors have to do with
the LG Nexus most of us have been
concerned with the fact that these are
watered down specifications this is not
an LG g4 when under chassis but actually
that's not necessarily bad a lot of
people complain with the fact that the
Nexus 6 was too expensive than the nexus
5 was too watered down so apparently
google is wanting to launch both
products meaning you'll get a nexus 6
from huawei that'll be the high-end
phone and an LG Nexus will apparently be
dubbed the Nexus 5x which would be the
more affordable option with watered-down
specifications gives you the option
which is a great idea let's move the
spotlight over to Microsoft I know that
many of you are already enjoying the
benefits of Windows 10 but a lot of you
are waiting for features like for
example extensions on the Spartan
browser in addition to other options
that are currently not available and
that are expected to launch in the
feature update of Windows 10 that was
expected to launch in October for those
of you that had set their calendars well
it seems that it'll happen until
November for reasons that we don't yet
understand but it's not like a Microsoft
promised anything so stay tuned and one
of the products that is expected to be
announced in the Apple September nine
events is its new Apple TV we heard the
rumors that there are two variants the
old variant which is apparently going to
stay at 69 bucks and we heard that the
newer variant would bring all the
feature packs that we hear that Apple
TV will be in the future but it'll cost
you two hundred dollars and now we have
trusted sources that are claiming that
the price tag is already defined it will
cost 150 dollars but there's a catch
there is no for cake apparently this
will launch in 1080p and yeah it'll be a
downside for power users but then again
if you're going to be watching cable on
this thing what cable gives you 4k right
now and finally for the very interesting
rumors of the day we start hearing more
about the iphone success two different
news that are particularly concerning
for some and probably good for others
first of all it seems that the iphone is
not only getting thicker because of the
four such technology but apparently also
taller and wider now the changes are
negligible but this is the first time
that Apple actually does this with an
iphone which is interesting but the bad
news is that apparently Apple was not
able to have these products past the
shattered tests for the set fire on the
lens of the iphone and bear in mind
iphones have had a sapphire lens for the
camera ever since the iphone for us
apparently this did not make the cut
apparently we're getting Gorilla Glass
and even though we're not sure if it's
Gorilla Glass 4 or whatever it is a very
interesting change for Apple
particularly with a phone that actually
needs to have a better camera with all
the competition but it does leave me to
the question of the day do you complain
about the fact that your smart phone
doesn't have a sapphire lens that a
requirement that you are looking for in
the phone that you want in my case so
long as the lens is good enough does not
scratch I don't care but I have had
cases where you do get scratches even
with the best Gorilla Glass so yeah for
me it's concerning I do care about
photography leave is a comment down
below what is your case friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the nose earlier before this video
was filmed make sure you follow those
are firing out off comment subscribe to
youtube channel as well if all be on
twitter himout just go to be better on
instagram at heine nevada please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am high memory that I thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
