front pocket now calm and this is the LG
optimus 7 running Windows Phone 7 mango
beta 2 in this video we're going to take
a look at the social integration and
mango beta 2 especially at Twitter and
LinkedIn and how you can get updates
from a certain contact once you link his
linkedin twitter facebook windows live
accounts you his contact card on your
phone so let's take a look
okay so we're back and let's check out
the settings and see how the accounts
are looking while they are being set up
so as you can see currently it's sinking
we have windows live which is compulsory
it's part of the setup process then we
have facebook which was there also
before the mango beta we got my exchange
account and you can notice linkedin and
twitter now once you set up twitter and
linkedin it will connect to your windows
live account so that when you sync
windows live it will basically sync
twitter and linkedin to now let's jump
back to our contact and i will be using
my colleagues adam lanes contact card
for this example and demonstration we
got Adam right here and right now we
only have him linked to our exchange
account so it's a contact on our
exchange server which was pulled down to
the phone now from here we can link the
contact to several other social networks
as you can see the link button right
there and let's see what the options are
we have twitter windows live facebook
and linkedin and tapping on these
suggestions will link your contacts to
the appropriate contact on those social
networking is now you might notice that
sometimes your contact in your windows
live contacts or on your exchange
account does have a different name than
your contact on twitter for instance if
you don't have the contact listed you
can choose a contact from here and start
typing his name from there you can
choose to connect to your contact which
is displaying his name in a different
way on the other social network and okay
now getting back to the contact card
which is now linked should display the
new contact information and as you can
see we got a new avatar and we've got
the latest status update which happened
the latest so if for instance the latest
activity is on Twitter you will have the
Twitter
here if it's on faceboook you will have
the Facebook activity we have it linked
now 25 social networks to so the contact
card is linked to five contacts until
one out of which is exchanged and the
other ones are windows live Facebook
Twitter and LinkedIn now swiping to the
left brings you the what's new screen
which is totally integrated here you
will see activity from twitter also
twitter twitter twitter twitter facebook
linkedin messenger so everything is
aggregated in this what's new screen of
course pictures is nothing new a history
you can see some history between me and
him but what's really important is that
now we are having and receiving updates
from his social networks now if we pin
the contact you are start screen you
will see that once there is an activity
either on Twitter or on Facebook the
live tile will animate in order to bring
you that certain update right now it
only shows the name because the last
activity has happened approximately 11
hours ago if I recall well but once Adam
for instance will tweet something is
contact information on the live tile
will switch and you will see that
certain update now let's get back and
see how maybe we can send him a tweet
this is mentioned on twitter and we can
send a hello message which is a public
message it says hello will send this one
and Adam will receive it as a mention
but you can also send a direct message
now if in this mansion on Twitter screen
you will be entering a d as in direct
message right before the hand also
whoops century so d the twitter handle
and for instance test as your text your
contact will receive that certain
information as a direct message on
twitter if you have all your contacts
set up
properly then your people hub should
reflect all the updates according to how
it's being set up currently we are
receiving updates from everybody because
we are having the all accounts set up
whoops let's get back all accounts but
we can choose to filter windows live
Twitter LinkedIn and Facebook unless
just for the sake of argument select
Twitter and now we see only the updates
which are from our contacts on Twitter
for instance we are seeing an update
here a tweet from from Brandon and we
can easily retweet or post a reply so
this was a short demonstration on how
Windows Phone 7 mango beta 2 and
hopefully the final version will handle
social integration it's now got windows
live twitter linkedin and facebook the
main social networks and we will be
expecting Microsoft to add some more in
the future this was ends in the night
from pocketnow.com thank you very much
for watching the windows phone 7 mango
to beta preview of social integration
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
