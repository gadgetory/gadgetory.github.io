their battery replacement plan as
analysts predict major losses Samsung
details what to expect with its newest
Exynos mobile processor and oneplus has
just surprised us with another awesome
edition for the 1 + 5 t i'm high metal
ivenna and yesterday's comments about a
name for the show in Spanish ended up in
t shirt comments and I don't know just
bring in some more ideas this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with product announcement says
oneplus has just told us about its 1 + 5
t in sandstone white and for those of
you asking yourself why I don't have one
the reason why it's because I've been
traveling so much the package is
actually waiting for me in Vegas so yeah
I cannot wait to get this unit and the
coolest part is in addition to the fact
that it brings a new type of finish on
the design well it pretty much is price
like your typical 128 gigabyte variant
of the 1 + 5 t so you'd get pretty much
all the bells and whistles and this new
color option you can learn more in a
description other interesting official
news is that well speaking of Si yes
believe it or not the FCC Chairman was
supposed to speak at the event and he
just cancelled then you wonder exactly
why I mean does it really have to do
with the fact that he imagined exactly
what was going to happen meaning
everybody would just go crazy at him for
the whole net neutrality deal and
everything sad news and hopefully we get
the opportunity to I don't know confront
the guy at some point in the future as
consumers as it's supposed to be now
serve on Microsoft the company has just
patented something we are still
scratching our heads to understand it's
a foldable phone dock and we're trying
to understand exactly what Microsoft is
doing the company is making a major push
into hardware but this phone dock
doesn't look like anything that you can
use with the Windows Phone it actually
even seems like if it has a lightning
point at the tip so well yeah Microsoft
has really been expanding into other
platforms so hardware for other
platforms is the next deal I guess
that's what the spotlight over the
Samsung and the X and O's 90
eight and the company has a sort of
detail what to expect from the fact that
it's got slightly faster clock speeds
when compared to the snapdragon 845 even
though these processors are pretty much
made by Samsung at least from the
manufacturing standpoint but most
interesting we've got some sort of a
neural engine here that Samsung didn't
really detail in addition to the fastest
LTE speeds etc we should learn more at
CES and finally the very interesting
news today have to do with Apple and
older iPhones as this is very
interesting we've got analysts
predicting that because of this whole
battery replacement deal Apple is going
to lose a crazy ten point three billion
dollars this year pretty much not
selling sixteen million iPhones and the
reason why is because well if your
consumer and you're not really looking
into upgrading you're definitely just
gonna pay twenty nine bucks replace the
battery and get your phone running like
new that's the I guess thought process
of the analyst but the question today
what do you think do you think that
consumers are really going to halt from
upgrading because they can make their
older iPhones run faster in my case I
don't think consumers behave that way
particularly people that are in
contracts
they are up for an upgrade and guess
what they'll do they'll just upgrade and
probably bestow the old iPhone to
somebody else or they will some people
have a yearly replacement plans where
they'll just replace their phone that's
