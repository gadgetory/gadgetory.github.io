instantly wrote it off as being a
gimmick device without justification but
in my week of testing I've learned that
utility isn't always defined by an
abundance of features I'm high auto
Houston with a pocket now and you're
watching our video review of the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge+
if you thought the name was a mouthful
just wait until you get this phone in
your hand with a 5.7 inch display the s6
edge is one of the bigger phones around
adding half an inch of screen real
estate when compared to its smaller
sibling the galaxy s6 edge it retains
the same qHD AMOLED display technology
and improves on the already excellent
outdoor visibility and it's just one of
the best displays money can buy likewise
the spec sheet on the edge plus should
be more than sufficient enough to make
the phone last through the next couple
of years without a hitch specs like 4
gigabytes of RAM a 64-bit octa-core
processor built in-house by Samsung and
a 3000 milliamp hour sealed battery as
is the case with the original Galaxy s6
edge the edge plus lacks microSD
expansion but strangely enough this time
around it's also missing an IR blaster
nevertheless the aluminium and glass
chassis is just a larger version of the
otherwise identical s6 edge the same
dual edge display the same physical home
button the same speaker and port layout
on the bottom it's important to mention
that none of this is really a bad thing
the s6 edge was one of the best-looking
phones we'd ever seen at the time of our
review and not much has happened to
change our mind since then my only
complaints about the overall design of
the s6 edge+ are the speaker placement
which is incredibly easy to accidentally
cover
and that it's noticeably less
comfortable to hold than the galaxy note
5 that launched alongside it thanks to
the curved glass there's not really much
room on the sides to hold on to and the
note 5 actually reverses this design
with curves around back to make it fit
much better in the hand and feel smaller
than its large display would let on the
s6 edge+ doesn't feel as unwieldy as the
Nexus 6 for sure
but you definitely feel the whole screen
here the software experience on the s6
edge+ falls in line with the rest of
Samsung's 2015 flagship lineup which is
to say it's leaps and bounds better than
anything we'd seen out of the company
prior TouchWiz running on top of android
5.1 lollipop finally adds considerations
to improve the user experience without
much detracting from the clean
experience stock Android has to offer
it's still a little bright and punchy by
default but you're going to solve themes
that rework everything from the
notification panel to your icon pack and
keyboard to really make it best fit you
features like multi window are still
here of course and Samsung still builds
its Flipboard briefing panel into the
home screen you can disable it if you
don't want it of course but it's
actually becoming one of my favorite
parts of the software I did constantly
find myself wishing there were more
software tweaks taking advantage of the
edge display though the people and app
edges are handy for quick access to
frequent items and the ambient ticker
can be a great way to view information
and notifications without expending
battery life but my biggest complaint is
that only one edge is ever useful at a
time it's great that you can change the
position of the people edge tab from one
side to the other but whichever side you
don't choose just acts like the flat
rest of the display
this was forgivable on previous devices
like the Galaxy Note edge the three
durations in I expected a little more
out of such unique hardware on the other
hand the camera here is nothing short of
breathtaking the s6 edge+ uses the same
sensor found of the galaxy s6 s6 edge
and note 5 with 16 megapixels at your
disposal and an F 1.9 aperture for
pulling in more light and providing
better depth in photos you can capture
raw photos if you'd like but regardless
of which format you shoot in photos are
full of color detail and depth and even
in low-light where most cameras
struggle the s6 edge+ manages impressive
images without excessive noise or blur
the front-facing camera uses a wide
angle lens capable of capturing
full-body selfies and group photos and
of course either camera can still be
initiated almost instantaneously with a
double press of the home button if
you're primarily looking to use your
phone for its camera it really doesn't
get much better than this and a Lee use
throughout my week with the phone the
galaxy s6 edge+ has been one of the
fastest devices I've yet tested whether
I'm flicking through home screens
jumping between multiple apps or even
multitasking the edge plus remains
smooth and consistent and while some
others in the industry have reported
poor memory management on their devices
I've had no such problems when using
either our AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile review units
call quality / both networks has been
good as well and the edge plus has a
strong antenna to both find and retain a
networked gaming is as seamless as you'd
expect given the phone's strong spec
list but what really surprised me
whenever I'd fire up asphalt 8 or
Monument Valley is that the phone never
heated up even after hours of gaming at
a time in fact the only time I could get
it to warm up at all was when I was
rapid charging it which should take an
hour or less to fully top off at 3000
milliamp hour battery and while 3,000
milliamps may sound a bit small to power
a large high-density display battery
life on the s6 edge was yet another
pleasant surprise I've been regularly
hitting between four and a half to five
hours of screen on time even in those
days of excessive gaming in most retail
stores the galaxy s6 edge+ is likely to
be the most expensive phone you can buy
exceeding the cost of even the iPhone 6
plus and galaxy note 5 so of course the
million dollar question is is it worth
it is the galaxy s6 edge+ so good that
it's worth shelling out over $800 after
taxes to experience and you know what I
have to say yes some people might prefer
Samsung's note series and in fact I
think I'm one of them but what the note
offers in precision and versatility the
edge matches with unparalleled style and
a unique feature set that can only grow
and improve over time
the combination of crazy specs great
battery life and outstanding camera and
software that makes use of every inch of
the screen makes the Galaxy s6 edge+ one
of the best phones you can pick up this
fall season that's going to do it for a
video review of the Galaxy s6 edge+
