there you know I just uh you know I
can't it's hard to stay away i guess um
um am I supposed to you were supposed to

that are popping up so it's very you
know then by all means please do
introduce the rest of the team all right
now we've got editor-in-chief Anton
Dino's just nod thank you very much
anyway uh chief news editor Stephen
shank style what it is mr. minimun Nate
before we go on can you explain a little
bit about the table behind you and
what's what's there a lot of crap I got
a ncube a three do a virtual boy and far
too many cables that's my video game
table I think he's got enough gear there
just to build a whatever shelter or a
mobile radio station or 10 computers I
don't understand
don't understand why you have a gamecube
I'm sure you haven't played it since the
late 90s look one winter god i played
mario golf to keep my swing you know up
to par we're so ready to go when spring
comes around practice makes perfect yeah
all right good and senior editor tizzy
Taylor Martin fizzy hello how's it going
it's been like 30 minutes since I talked
to you or something you guys like you
just can't shake me you just cannot well
wait a sec we'll talk about one thing
and then I will I was just I just wanted
to say hi and I want to talk about one
thing um I am so so a Taylor sent me his
his moto x which i gave the life
treatment um and and and then i had to
send it back to him so that he could do
the durability report oh and you made
sure he has something to write about
exactly i wanted to make it I know my
one of the move because he sent it to me
in like a pristine condition and I
wanted it to be a little bit used
because Taylor babies his phones and the
average guy like me throws it around a
little bit you know anyway so I I send
it back to him but I felt so much in
love with the Moto X that I ordered one
of my own and I spent like weeks
obsessing over the color combination
that I wanted because you know Michael
got his white back or white front with
his like royal blue black and the yellow
accents and I don't think he's so hot on
it um Taylor did a really awesome
combination with cement on the back
black on the front and orange accents
the orange is fantastic yeah look at
that it's a really really good
combination and then um you know they
came out with all these wood colors now
some of which require you to have a
white front or else you're gonna get
this weird sandwich look like the teak
and the the bamboo um was anyway so I
don't want the wood because it's a
little too experimental so after
thinking about this for a very very long
time i went with navy on the back silver
accents and black on the front that is
that I I'm really really happy with this
so if anyone out there is thinking about
the motorola x and wants something that
really works well this works well
although mama says that navy and black
don't go well together but I don't know
agree yeah that's today Jojo why didn't
you get the new the new wooden back yeah
ebony man ebony bird like buttons black
front Manny or whatever is gonna happen
to its gonna delaminate or something I
um no more than this one wheel because
they have the same laminate this is the
woven back yep then the problem although
the wood it like they very predominant
vertical stripes and it's just a little
too much you know it's been slimming is
what it is that's what what does it's
slimming when I am when I used to go out
on dates before I got married cuz I'm
kind of short I would wear it's just
shirts with stripes to go you know
vertical in hopes that I'd add you know
visually a little bit to myself but that
won't image for everyone to take home
with you yeah anyway sorry for being a
live crasher I'm going to jump off now
but hey you let me ask you what should
they do driver let's let's talk let's
treat you like a guest do you have any
questions for the team um let's see I
would like to know Stephen who put the
BOP in the bop she bop it up I don't
know but I can tell you who put the ram
and the rama lama ding dong please tell
me i want to find him I have a question
for Brandon and what do you think about
all these new colored Nexus 5 rumors is
is everything of fakery or Google and LG
finally decided to bring some color to
nexus users yeah I think it's real and I
think it's really interesting because
the nexus 5 has a colored earpiece so
it's not just a backing it also carries
over to the front a little bit in like a
really subtle way so I I think it'd be
pretty badass to have like a red back or
like like purple or something unique and
then you get the little circle e dot
that's colored to your busy mm-hmm how
fake does that new picture look it's a
case so if a glutton yeah yeah somebody
used the magic wand tool in Photoshop
didn't even you
was like the feather tool to smooth the
edges or anything and like change the
color to yellow and it dad it just looks
bad it doesn't even look real and the
one from the previous day was pretty
heavily be bought separately on its own
merits I mean I don't know guys I mean I
think it's I think it's real and I think
it's a way to juice nexus 5 cells when
they're kind of blah at this point when
people are waiting for all the new
phones to come out like mo World
Congress can have all these great new
phones and maybe the nexus 5 will come
out with new colors and I reduced price
maybe it's nothing I'd like it i'm not
saying I wouldn't like us colored Nexus
but that that was pretty fake I mean
even the website like you can easily
easily do that yourself using its parent
or view source there's a new picture
apparently an alleged nexus 5 in red
pictured in real life about which I
posted this morning and that's the late
looking one that's the fake looking one
okay you're talking about yeah okay I
thought you were talking about the
mock-ups it's all fake what one question
for you guys do you think that Microsoft
would really release in a android phone
under their nokia division um that's a
good question well i think that nokia is
still able to use the nokia brand
because microsoft realizes it back to
them and nokia is not able to currently
out Lumia or windows phones now Android
on the x normally wouldn't be Android
per se it would be a fourth version of
Android which is on the kindle fire or
on other tablets so i think that it
could be possible yes and it wouldn't
hurt microsoft nor nakia are you saying
that nokia would release this separately
from microsoft yeah they will release it
as whatever is left of nakia before die
think i'm pretty sure their agreement
said that they couldn't use nokia name
for any smartphones in particular they
can still use it for dumb phones but i'm
pretty sure this android thing would
count under these or maybe they will
dumb down android to the level of Asha
that's what everyone wants really is
just take everything good out of android
on one thought that could be possible
here is that Nokia's feature phone
business is going kaput and they need
you know maybe this is going to be there
low-end devices running a forked version
of Android that you know they can sell
you know have they can have the Lumia
premium devices then they could have
these cheaper Android phones sell them
in emerging markets are like nothing
that's that's what I think as well okay
I'll go ahead yantai know is there a
sneaker on your shirt are you is yep yep
that is a sneaker yes and I also i also
have a Hootie so in case I'm a gold I
can do this that is let's all have our
hoodies up yeah let's do you think this
is this thing how do you think cool
close enough Brandon close enough so you
can in in case you are not yet following
brand the minimum after his 10 years
with pocket now you can find him at
Brandon minimun on Twitter and he i
think is also active on google+ correct
me if i'm wrong no no he hates google
man well go ahead follow him and read
about the occasional moto x thrashing
activities and yes that he get navy
because it's not gonna show many
scratches and bumps taylor tell her i
didn't i didn't really I it's not that
bad I like you drop right yeah it's not
that bad i just i'm just giving you a
hard time cuz i send it to you a perfect
condition but it no it's not bad like
it's got some dings on it but i don't
want to spoil it the durability report
will be up later today I mean you know
look no further than then Michaels phone
in after the buzz it his looks even
worse than than what i sent you so you
know and Michael's more careful than
than I am so you know All Things
Considered I think you should let me off
the hook I think at the Lincoln held up
pretty well but you're still um I'm
still calling you out in the video okay
okay all right journalistic integrity
brand of any final plaatsen
and no thanks for uh let me join thanks
