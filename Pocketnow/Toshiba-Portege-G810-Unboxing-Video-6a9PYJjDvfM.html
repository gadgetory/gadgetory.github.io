pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
of the toshiba g 8 10 this is the first
time that a software company in this
case spb mobile software house has
collaborated with a hardware company
toshiba to create a device I'm really
interested to see how this turns out so
let's get started us plug bring in the
camera a little bit all right let's look
around the box now this is a quad-band
phone so you can use it in the US on
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile looks like we have
some tape here okay so software getting
started pretty big users guide see what
it looks like color no no color
unfortunately that's okay here's the
device will look at that in a minute
here's a battery it is 1530 milliamp
hours that's pretty big for a smaller
device like this USB which uses yes mini
USB on the other end that's good not
proprietary headphones
and of course a charger with a different
plug all right so let's take a look at
the device
flush touch screen one of the very few
windows mobile devices that has a flush
screen no edges here these buttons are
completely flat there is no texture to
them so i think they are touch sensitive
because there's no tactile feedback here
so we have a camera in the front it's
pretty thin well let's see how it
compares to other devices similar device
the HTC touch quite a bit thinner than
the HTC touch taller to same size screen
2.8 inches alright see how it compares
to the iphone thicker than the iphone
it's got quite a pronounced hump here
for the for the camera i'm noticing that
and next to the 18 detail which also has
the same size screen huh so very
interesting i'm very curious to see the
software enhancements that have been
made to this device from spb mobile
software house lots more on this to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
