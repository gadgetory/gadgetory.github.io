smartphone space is that second time is
a charm it's hard to make a great phone
on the first round and it's about that
time for the pioneer of gaming phones to
show us their true potential party from
New York City I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
with parking man let's talk about the
razor phone - last year razor told us
that their first phone was designed for
gamers this year the company strategy is
to position the razor phone to as a
flagship gaming phone
this means that Razer wants to compete
not just in the gaming space but also
with flagships the result is a phone
that looks a lot like its predecessor
but it's not we now have a glass back
that comes in two finishes either a
mirror glass or a limited edition satin
finish this solves the first complaint
of users with the previous variant where
the triple headed snake could not glow
now it works in all of its 16.8 million
colored glory and that actually varies
depending on notifications the rest of
the design closely resembles its
predecessor but the speakers are
actually ever so slightly smaller even
if more powerful see everything in the
speakers has changed to allow ip67
watering dust resistance to address this
the company increases size of the
speaker box in order to create a
resonance chamber making audio richer in
conjunction to the 24-bit DAC with Dolby
Atmos support tucked inside we have a
new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor
eight gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of
expandable storage a four thousand
milliamp hour battery with quick charge
for plus support qi wireless charging
and razer is launching its own chroma
colored fast wireless charger as an
optional accessory to allow an even
better gaming experience the razor phone
2 includes a new large vapor chamber
cooling system allowing heat to
dissipate across the whole chassis when
gaming and high-intensity this is
actually a similar technology to what
the company has on its 15-inch laptops
and razer promises zero lags when it
comes to playing games we have a new 5.7
inch XO LCD at quad HD resolution 120
Hertz of refresh rate yes that's back
and to solve last year's complaints the
brightness is now doubled at 645 Mets
this also continues to be the only phone
certified for Netflix HDR content and it
actually shows that this play looks
really good and then powering the
experience we have Android 8.1 Oreo with
the same skin from last year powered by
Nova prime the company claims Android Pi
is coming soon but no dates were really
provided so the experience so far with a
couple of hours that we played with the
phone looks really good and then finally
to solve the biggest elephant in the
room let's talk about the cameras Razer
made a huge jump to Sony IMX sensors for
this camera in order to fix the problems
this includes oh is on the primary 12
megapixel sensor now with F 1.7 aperture
and a secondary 12 megapixel camera deft
2.6 aperture and telephoto capabilities
whether the company actually solve the
problem or not will have to wait for a
full review pricing begins at $7.99 for
the mirror glass variant and if you want
to go higher in storage or different
color options the price gets deeper
after that so yes this is the razor
phone to let us know what you think in
