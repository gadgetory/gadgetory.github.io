part three of the video review for the
electro via scribbler
four thousand two
going to go through the handwriting
recognition software as well as the
speech recognition software first let's
go through the handwriting software
right now I have no pad open and if you
look on the left side of the screen
you'll notice that there's a little icon
sticking out on the side this is the
tablet pc input panel if i hover over it
it sticks out a little bit further and
then tapping it brings it out in full
view of the screen another way to get to
this is if you're in Word or Internet
Explorer if you hover over an area where
you actually want to type and just tap
on it tap on the screen another icon
comes up that again just denotes the
tablet pc input panel and starts the
input panel right over where you tapped
it so let me move this out in the middle
here there are three handwriting
recognition methods here are input
methods I should say the first is the
writing pad the second is a character
pad and the third is the on-screen
keyboard on the writing pad all you do
is just right in the CLL area above the
line and if i write this is a test
period it recognizes my handwriting if
you notice my handwriting is not the
growth greatest in the world and what it
does is it puts the words in the just
below the line and it kind of predicts
what it thinks you're writing and so
here it it predicted pretty correctly i
wrote down this is a test and if i want
to put it into whatever i'm writing in
to you just tap on the insert button and
there it goes
another thing you can do is a little
input pack there's a writing pad here is
let's say I made a mistake let's say i
right thank you let's say I wrote it
thank you with an a all right here it
thinks i wrote thank Jung what you can
do is you can use the eraser pad on your
tablet pen here and just erase the each
letter or the whole word or if I want to
erase the whole word just strike through
it or the last option you can do is just
pick one of the words that it predicted
tap on it and it brings you to this
other screen where it has some words
that thinks you're trying to write or
you can sit here you can actually delete
the whole word delete individual letters
for example hero sleet the K here or you
can just write right in the panel right
into each of the individual boxes and I
can click OK and insert the next input
method is the character pad so I'm going
to hit enter here if I go to the
character pad like it kind of indicates
you just write one character at a time
so i'm going to write thanks again and
here you can see it thinks I've the a
that I wrote was a nine to correct it
I'll have to do just kind of like in the
handwriting recognition area is just
write the a or just click a little down
arrow and it kind of tries to predict
what you're trying to right there and
you just input it right in and there you
go and then the less input method is the
on-screen keyboard similar to windows
mobile devices it just replicates a
qwerty keyboard and you can just type on
the keyboard here and it will show up
real time so i'll write this
is oops any test again so it works
pretty well the keyboard automatically
comes up on fields that our password
related like on a web page if you're
trying to log into a your bank account
or if you're trying to log on to a a
userform the keyboard comes up on the
password portion of the fields makes a
little easier for you because if you're
trying to do the handwriting it may not
predict it properly after using this
handwriting software for a few weeks I
noticed that it was cool and fun to use
I found there were times where I would
have preferred having a full keyboard
where I could actually type faster than
I can actually write and after a while
my hand kind of cramps up I think part
of its just i'm used to using the
keyboard but you know in the most part
it worked pretty accurately there were
times where it just didn't recognize
what i was writing at all and you'd have
to go back and correct it so while it's
a neat application i think a lot of
users will still prefer having the
keyboard i think the the only time I
really actually used the handwriting
application is with Windows journal
which i'm going to show you real quick
right here again it's just a lying piece
of paper and i just take notes during
meetings on this and it was just nice
and easy to do i didn't have a bunch of
papers just laying around so that was
the handwriting's recognition software
let me go into the speech software i'm
the assistant icon tray here at the
bottom if i click on it up comes up a
menu to start the software i'm going to
turn it on and it will just start
recognizing what you're trying to do
through some basic commands for example
if I say start menu the start menu comes
up I can also say start menu again start
menu and it closes it down you can also
launch applications of the same method I
could say start windows media player and
the application starts up I can also say
clothes
closed and the application closes down
another use for this speech recognition
software is if I were to go into notepad
I can actually start speaking speaking
to it and we'll start transcribing the
any words I say so for example may start
notepad here actually I'll do it through
the voice recognition start notepad and
the application is up and as you can see
it was trying to recognize what I was
trying to say so it's it recognizes some
of my my words but it doesn't recognize
all of them so you can see at the end
where I said them it says it typed in
the you can also say some other commands
for example I could say delete sentence
and it deleted the whole sentence for me
you could also say delete word delete
word or you could save backspace and
I'll show you right here backspace
backspace
close don't save so it's a pretty neat
little toy to play with I think a lot of
the a lot of the handwriting's or i
should say the lot of the speech
recognition is not completely accurate
as as you notice there but no as as
Microsoft Works I this I hopefully will
get better in the future so this has
been raised one with pocket now calm and
