what to expect from the oneplus 7 pro it
looks like Foxconn is gearing up to be
Apple supplier of micro LED displays in
the future and the Galaxy S 10 5g caught
fire to somebody in South Korea but
samson claims that the phone's just fine
i'm hi mehta ravenna and i was thinking
about a joke today but the Sonic the
Hedgehog trailer is about as bad as it
can get this is marking out daily
brought to you by the geniuses over a
Twix the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for a
Samsung Galaxy S 10 dual SIM variant and
you actually want to pay less money
currently on eBay there's a seller that
has the SME for ahora around 596 dollars
then a little over six hundred dollars
for the s10 and 775 for the Galaxy S ten
plus these are dual SIM variants fully
unlocked you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
Google pixel three pixel three excel as
if the company apparently is not selling
as well as even the pixel two was
selling back in the day and Google
apparently is saying that the reason why
is because definitely the consumers saw
that there's a higher price tag and
there's differences in demand we kind of
think it has everything to do with the
design of the phone and something
prettiest thing out there hopefully that
changes with the next pixels even if the
rumors are that we're getting other
pixels that are gonna look just the same
now a recent report that came from South
Korea is that the galaxy s 10 5g caught
fire to a consumer one consumer not many
so this is not another exploding gate or
whatever the case because apparently
Samsung already had a look at the phone
and they seem to have found out that
this was not necessarily a problem with
the product they haven't provided
details as to what the product problem
was then for us to know exactly what but
yeah the Galaxy S 10 5g is a current
thing over in Korea we can't wait to get
our units here in the United States man
and let's move the spotlight over to
Apple there were rumors that Apple was
working really hard on getting micro LED
technology for devices like iPads and
even macbook displays up to the point
where the new reports have Foxconn
wanting to be a supplier in the past we
heard that sharp was going to be the
company but then
Foxconn sort of acquired something from
sharp and we heard of another supplier
from Japan but now it seems that Foxconn
actually wants to make these displays
for Apple obviously you know that Apple
doesn't play with just one supplier so
obviously that might be a very
interesting mix going forward but we'll
keep you posted as this develops and
finally the hottest news today have to
do with the oneplus 7 pro separately one
leaked has a photos from this phone
showing a wide-angle camera which is
surprising it's great we see the triple
cameras and we were hoping that one of
these wasn't going to be a depth sensor
and apparently that's going to be the
case but then we also see ads on the
Wall Street Journal I believe or the New
York Times where we pretty much get told
what to expect from this phone
no bloat no bells no whistles no knotch
no $2,000 price tag which I consider to
be the sickest burn against companies
that are doing this in the comments down
below let us know what you think I mean
do you think that the oneplus 7 pro
given all the rumors would be this like
really hot device that you're gonna want
to buy because in my case I think it
will so long as the price tag remains
what makes oneplus popular that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion and friends as
