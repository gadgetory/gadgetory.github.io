and I've got a treat for you today we're
going to be unboxing the samsung galaxy
note 10.1 it's got a 1.4 quad-core
processor and 2 gig of ram that should
be impressive let's go take a look so
before we get started unboxing let's
take a look around the box now this is a
review unit it's been around the block
before so there's a little bit of damage
to the box you can see over here this is
our press kit this is the Wi-Fi version
up on the top and a little damage on the
box due to shipping here's the Samsung
logo over here on the side galaxy note
10.1 and a do not accept if seal is
broken now that came this way again
because this is a a press unit but I
promise we haven't opened this box yet
on the back we have a whole bunch of
specifications this is where we see that
it's a quad-core 1.4 and in fact it does
have two gig of ram which it says that
somewhere back here five megapixel back
facing camera and a 1.9 front facing
camera huge battery on this thing 7000
milliamp hours and yes it does have the
S Pen Stylus built in over on this side
some numbers that you don't need to see
and a blank side so let's go ahead and
lift the box inside nothing and then
we've got the Galaxy Note 10.1 itself
again with bubbles here because this has
been reviewed by other people before us
set that aside and let's go inside we
have a nice little bundle of
documentation that's kept together by a
neat little band here so that's kind of
cool we've got so new stylist tips
haven't seen those in a long time then
of course a ring there to be able to
pull the old stylus out that's what that
is you grab onto it and pull out over
here we have just your regular USB cord
on that end and the Samsung
proprietary connector on that end got
the wall wart USB over here all wrapped
in nice protective skins and then since
this is the US version I've got a us
plug and that simply plugs right down in
there adds a little bit of bulk to the
unit but it works it does its job we'll
put both of those back and and that's it
there's nothing else inside this box I
can even get that up that's it just the
box itself so let's go back over to the
device now so here we go go ahead and
take the front screen protector off
somehow if I can find a corner you've
got a nice little tab right there for us
so we'll remove that and set it aside
we've got some more things falling down
all around me here we've got some more
screen protectors or device protectors
over here on the sides a whole bunch
we're not going to take those off right
now but this whole area is covered with
them and it's a pain to take all those
off because I mean they're just teeny
look at that just ridiculously small but
to the device we've got our sensors and
our camera right up front samsung logo
the the wonderful front-facing speakers
right here up on top so you can hold
this very nicely your thumbs rest here
the speakers are up on top right there
and right there so you can hear what you
are what you're watching finally you can
hear what you're watching down here on
the bottom we've got a microphone we've
got that Samsung proprietary connector
port sorry guys no micro USB like on the
Nexus 7 you gotta deal with that over
here on the side we've got as you can
see that this is a big tablet guys
you've got your S Pen with that
removable tip right there and this does
have a little quickie point on it so you
can push on that I don't know if that
means it's an active
or not put it right back into the stylus
well and it just it integrates very well
in there it's held in there very tightly
I like it quite a bit in fact I'm so
glad to see style I coming back over
here on this side nothing over here on
the top we have our headphone jack our
IR da port our micro USB port and this
is reported to accept up to a 64
gigabyte micro SDXC card so lots of
extra capacity that we can have in there
volume up and down rocker and power
right there turn this over on the back
we've got a got to take this back
protector off somehow really hate these
things guys especially on camera they're
a pain in the neck anyway since it
doesn't look like i'm going to be able
to get that off maybe it's not supposed
to come off anywho we've got back here
our camera and our flash and then it has
a little picture over here i think
that's just on the protector that says
there's your microSD slot and some very
simple Samsung branding some fine print
down here that you can't even see in a
picture that says you've got your stylus
well down there also very nice this is a
good looking device it feels nice in
hand not too light but not too heavy but
it feels pretty solid this feels like
plastic on the sides rather than real
metal but that's what we have these days
so how does this compare let's look at
the galaxy tab 7 whatever they call it
77 you can see it fits entirely within
the screen of the the tab 10.1 maybe
another view over there look at the back
of that we still have our camera and
whatnot see how the backs compare so
there is that one see how that compares
to the Nexus 7 so quite a bit of
difference there
and then if we want to compare all the
devices there we go there's that one and
then the galaxy s3 so you can tell this
this is a beast this is something that
you want again going to have a bluetooth
keyboard for so you can really use it as
a portable laptop but very cool so there
you go just a quick unboxing we're not
even going to power this thing up in
this video I'll might do that for the
end credits here if it's got a charge
and it looks like it does how about that
but there you go the samsung galaxy note
10.1 make sure you stay tuned because
we're going to get the review started
right away and we'll show you all the
cool stuff as it happens if you like
