pocketnow.com and we've got something
pretty cool to show you if you know the
company celio that makes the red fly you
know that they make a kind of netbook
like device that will allow you to
connect your windows mobile phone to a
device with a larger screen higher
resolution a full keyboard and a
touchpad so basically you have a big
screen for your mobile device and they
haven't been selling too well as far as
we know they keep lowering the price
they're coming out with new models
people in law enforcement and government
have been kind of adopting these but
consumers are wondering why you would
want to have a kind of a laptop solution
it costs you know $200 three hundred
dollars depending on the model when you
can just use your phone take it out of
your pocket or and use a netbook with it
well they come out with me this new beta
software which actually lets you connect
to any computer or any laptop and have
the same experience where you're using
your keyboard through your phone using
your mouse just as if you were using a
red fly and you can also change the
resolution so you can actually scale a
device like this to 1024 x 768
resolution anyway let me show you it now
okay so here we are at the computer and
for those of you that don't know this is
what the see Leo red fly looks like it's
this laptop like looking device that you
plug your windows mobile device into
anyway let's get started with the
demonstration so I'm simply going to
plug in this sprint HTC touch pro2 my to
the USB connector and I'm going to
launch the see Leo Corp red fly mobile
viewer right here which I've installed
and by the way this is free right now
but it's in beta for 60 days only
eventually they're probably going to
sell this software so I open this up and
I see that activesync is trying to
connect
and then I press the connect button and
it says connecting to USB please wait
and before before the screen actually
comes up let me show you some of these
buttons so we have disconnect we have
send an end if you're making a call you
have the left softkey the right softkey
okay and some other things over here so
here you see right now that we have the
screen that is coming from the sprint
touch pro right on the screen now it's
only scaled to 640 by 480 resolution
which is actually the native resolution
right now it's sort of pointless but
watch this if you go up to view you can
actually scale this to a full 1024 x 768
resolution this is a resolution that
windows mobile doesn't even support but
red fly is able to make this happen
which is one of the huge advantages of
actually using it so it's going to take
another moment to kind of render but
you're going to see that with full
fidelity it's going to make for a 1024 x
768 window okay and so here we are and
there's some display issues but we can
go into programs for you get a better
idea so wow look at this we've got a ton
of icons on the screen at once I've
never seen so many icons on a windows
mobile screen at one time we can go into
any program like the communications
manager and sometimes it doesn't scale
properly as seen here because obviously
the communications manager is not made
for such a massive resolution and we can
exit and we're back into active sync and
we can go into messaging and that i'd
imagine messaging is a great place to
use this because you can see a ton of
messages on the screen at one time and
just like as if you were using a red fly
you can use the keyboard from your
computer so i'm going to open up word
mobile and i'm going to use my keyboard
and type a document it slows down the
device a little bit but not too bad so
here we go it's almost loaded this is a
test of using my keyboard so there it is
just as you would expect so the mobile
viewer does indeed work pretty well it's
it does a good job at scaling your
device to a really high resolution that
you really can't get anywhere else if
you have a windows mobile device
of course all programs don't scale to
1024 x 768 resolution windows mobile
does not support this resolution but
artificially through the software it
does now what does this work with well
it works with a lot of devices windows
mobile touchscreen devices non touch
screen devices I know you probably can't
see this but the blackjack two for
example the motorola q 9h the HTC touch
pro touch diamond i mean it supports a
lot of devices but here's the big but
here's the big question if you have a
laptop with you our netbook and you have
your smartphone why would you want to go
onto your smartphone and put it on your
netbook or laptop screen to use wouldn't
you just use the native programs on your
netbook or a laptop or use the web-based
programs or something like that rather
than having to deal with kind of a
clunky interface of windows mobile when
things are slow and not perfectly
optimized for 1024 x 768 resolution
anyway whether it has utility or it
doesn't the program is free right now
and it's actually pretty cool so maybe
you should give it a try we'll post
links on pocketnow.com on how to
download it and for more windows mobile
