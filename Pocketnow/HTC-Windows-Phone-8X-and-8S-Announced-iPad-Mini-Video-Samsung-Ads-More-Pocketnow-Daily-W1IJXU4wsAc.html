8s the ipad mini mock-up gets compared
on video and the samsung ads are at it
again i'm high metal Yvetta confirming
that i want that Windows Phone 8x and
this is parking out daily HTC has just
launched their Windows Phone strategy
along with Microsoft where they bring
two signature devices the windows phone
8x and the Windows Phone 8 s notice the
names now the 8x is more of the flagship
device that brings a beautiful iconic
design along with some great specs now
we've got the windows phone 8s bringing
lesser specs on to that same beautiful
iconic design with a couple of variances
we've got some hands-on coverage of
these two devices that look really good
so far our first impressions are great
leave us a comment down below of what
you think though sadly we still don't
have specific dates for launch only a
couple of carriers now the iPad Mini or
I book has made the news again and this
time because the mock-up that we
recently saw has now been compared with
the iPad on video you'll notice on the
video this device does have a compelling
design and to be honest with you after
being spoiled by the Nexus 7 I
definitely be on the list of people that
will want to get one now since Apple has
been terrible at keeping secrets I would
call this device of reality their
speculations that the device will be
launched and announced in october though
we're still not sure about that facebook
has a new trick up their sleeve where
they're privately testing a new service
where they'll automatically upload your
photos into the cloud now what makes
this service special is the fact that
everything uploads automatically and
privately so you only share what you
want whatever the photos are available
call is a new hit iOS 6 shared photo
streams which didn't really make sense
to me now sadly we don't know when this
is going public but hopefully soon now
after giving you an in-depth tour of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 recently Sammy has
just come on record to confirm that the
device is coming to the United States
packing the quad-core Exynos processor
along with LTE which would be at first
now we still don't know specifically
when it will be launched but Black
Friday is the most probable date so make
sure you watch our hands-on video for
details so far the device is really
really good and finally
for the funny news of the day Samsung is
also making headlines because they've
now published their anti iPhone ads now
call me weird but I honestly feel that
these ads aren't necessary the galaxy s3
is a great product on its own and even
though Apple did have their Mac versus
PC ads years ago that was back then when
Apple was an underdog and Samsung is no
underdog of the market today so that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think about the samsung ads I
honestly find them funny but I feel that
they're not necessary and what they do
in my opinion is make the galaxy s3 look
inferior instead of superior which it
actually is so leave us a comment down
below now we want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow was on Parker now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm every better thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
