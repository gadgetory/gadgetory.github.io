iphone 4 factors are all around
antennagate turns into glass gate and
Microsoft and Adobe are tag teaming for
some sort of real serious competition
all this and more coming up right now
hello everybody I'm hi meta meta and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and they're not so cool inside the world
of Apple's iOS devices this week were
plagued with tons of rumors so let's
start off with the cool probably one of
the hottest rumors this week is the fact
that Apple's working on new iPhone form
factors to be released by the end of
this year and not on the same cycle of
year to year releases in June that we've
seen in the past now what can we expect
we'll ever you remember our rumors last
week we had an iphone 3.2 and a 3.3
being out there meaning they're probably
going to have the same form factor of
the iphone 4 probably in design but
apparently this is going to be a lower
end and a higher end model where the
lower end is going to be some sort of a
nanodevice the smaller screen and the
higher end is going to have a larger
screen probably 4 inches to compete with
the droid lineup now one of the rumors
is that these phones are not going to
come out on AT&amp;amp;T apparently it seems
that verizon is asking for an iphone and
it seems they want one with the largest
screen to match their droid lineup so
we'll see what happens in the end a lot
of rumors are out there hopefully it's
going to come out by the end of this
year and let's hope these rumors do come
true this time okay now hold the rumors
right there because it seems that there
are verizon iphone talks all around
again why is it credible well because
this time it's being talked about by the
same editor from The Wall Street Journal
that is always leaking really credible
information that eventually comes true
does Apple get really along with her
let's hope it's true because she's never
been wrong so hopefully there is going
to be a verizon iphone by the end of
this year really not know what to make
of it what sort of specifications is
going to bring but at least we hope it's
going to be some sort of differentiation
from the current iphone 4 with the 3.5
inch display like we talked about before
and yeah let's continue on with the
rumors because yahoo is apparently going
to bring an update to their messenger
app that will bring you video calls
to your iPhone and it will also bring
these same video calls to Android and we
currently also have that on chats with
the pc and mac so apparently you're
going to be able to communicate between
all these platforms and get video calls
will just bring FaceTime a run for their
money we're not sure because you know
voice over IP is really not good if you
move around so we'll see what happens in
the end hopefully it's going to be
released soon yahoo saying that it's
already been approved by the App Store
which I see very unlikely but you never
know and yeah probably the only cool
thing that happened this week that was
not a rumor was the fact that Google
finally released their google goggles
service for their iphone app and what
can we expect well just as you can do
with Android you can take pictures of
stuff and it will give you a search and
you can take pictures of barcode stuff
like that it'll actually tell you what
it is and give you information about it
searches etc so really cool services
coming into the iphone hopefully we'll
see more coming from google eventually
alright let's start off with a not so
cool it seems antenna gate has been
disappearing somehow but now it's going
to be glass gate why well it seems that
people that have actually gotten cases
that are not bumpers or getting a lot of
scratches that even I don't know some
sort of really hardcore scratches close
to breaks on their iphone 4s backings
because it seems the case that scratched
the back and the backing glass is not
really that sort of sapphire crystal
sophisticated not gorilla glass tile
stuff that you know jony ive's mentioned
on the demo video so it seems that Apple
has to go back to the drawing board
really not sure what to expect you know
continuing on with the rumors of what we
talked earlier it seems that Apple
really needs to release something that
will bring attention away from all the
flaws that the iphone 4 is brought aside
from the success so we're actually going
to clarify this as a rumor but it seems
that microsoft and adobe CEO is actually
met up to talk about apple and they
actually met up to talk about ways to
fight apple in their success on the
mobile space what do they talk about
well apparently they talk about selling
adobe to microsoft which we don't really
think is a good idea but we'll see what
happens in the end we actually expect
for this to actually bring adobe flash
to Windows Phone 7 devices or future
windows phone tablet or Windows tablet
devices that are not going to be
carrying when those seven in the
features so we'll see if this rumor
actually comes true because if it was a
secret meeting why do we know about this
and continuing on with the not-so-cool
it seems that apple's out to block
spotify before it makes the release in
the united states currently spotify is
the streaming service that works in the
UK and other countries in europe but
apparently apple's been meeting up with
the CEOs of these record companies to
see how they can block the service
because it seems that free services are
not really a good idea spotify is not
really free completely they'll only give
you a selection of songs for free and
then you have to pay premium 10 pounds
in the UK to get you know a unlimited
amount of songs for a whole month and it
seems Apple wants to block this but
within the rumors one of the things that
was talked about was the fact that
Apple's out to bring their own
subscription
service and that was also talked with
the record company CEO so you know Apple
what's wrong with competition buddies
probably the ugliest news this week was
the fact that somehow AT&amp;amp;T raised their
$75 early upgrade fees to 200 bucks if
you want anything except an iphone could
this have anything to do with Apple you
know what we think is this really a good
competition time you know it's not i
mean come on Windows Phone 7 is right
around the corner and somehow Apple
figured out how to get AT&amp;amp;T to waive
their early upgrade fees for the iphone
4 release but now figured out how to get
AT&amp;amp;T to more than double the fees for
the windows phone 7 launch this is
really bad for windows phone 7
supposedly ATT is going to be the flag
carrier startup and it seems they're not
going to start up really good this time
same thing that happened with verizon
with the really ugly data plans for the
Kin really bad competition strategies
