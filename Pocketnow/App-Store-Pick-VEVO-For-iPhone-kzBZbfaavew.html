around for a next app store pick hello
everybody I'm hi- in and welcome to the
pocket now app store pick where we'll be
featuring vivo evil is actually a free
music video service that was launched by
sony entertainment universal music and
other media companies in december of
2009 and now it brings us video music
service to iOS devices within the
application you actually start with the
Home Fleet of all featured videos and
you can actually launch any of these
featured videos by just tapping at one
of them sadly this doesn't have portrait
mode you have to turn your device on
landscape and its really cool it it
actually gives you that you know options
to know different stuff about different
artists that are signed in sony music
get me or any of these companies you'll
notice one of the cool things is
actually VEVO does a very cool job and
keeping the video and good quality even
if you're connected through Wi-Fi or 3g
once you finish watching the video you
can actually share the video through
twitter facebook or email you can also
add a playlist and actually have
different playlists saved in your device
you can view the comments of these
videos watch the credits and also even
buy the song from itunes which actually
launches the itunes app for you to
purchase either the whole album are just
the song that you're interested on sadly
evil doesn't do a very good job at
multitasking just yet it will actually
launch the application from the start
again but if you move through videos
you'll notice you can actually move
through top videos premieres and also
new videos that are out there
within the artist section you can
actually filter songs by different
artists depending on which ones are of
your preference are the ones that are
featured then you can actually go
through the playlist view and either
create your own playlist or use the
playlists that are offered by VEVO
within the settings and other cool
features you can actually find what
other nearby videos or other people
playing vball is actually free on the
App Store but it sadly locked to only
work within the United States for now
that's it for today's app store pick
