future manufacturer Nvidia CEO has
pretty much confirmed Microsoft's future
tablet plans and Google is now pushing
adds to your Google Maps I'm hi meri
beta and Google is there a way for me to
filter all those beer discounts on those
ads for the weekend this is out
daily alright so today is all about
rumors and let's start with the most
skeptical ones as invidious CEO has
pretty much confirmed micronauts for
your tablet plans he said they're
bringing it with the next surface so for
those of you that were expecting the
next surfaces to be one product just
running Windows 8.1 sadly that's
probably not going to be the case
because apparently it'll be running the
Tegra 4 and judging by the fact that no
smartphone manufacturers pretty much
picked that Tegra 4 up that is really
bad news judging by how the Tegra 3
perform badly on the surface RT so let's
see how that goes now let's move the
spotlight over to Samsung as we're just
a couple of weeks away from me but we
know that the next version of the Galaxy
Note will be launched in this event and
as it turns out we've got some leaks
that are confirming that the next
generation Galaxy Note 3 will be running
Android 4.3 m well that's kind of a
given I mean Samsung has done a great
job in the last couple of years and
launching each and every smartphone with
the latest version of Android whenever
they launch the phone the problem is
they're becoming terrible at updating
that software once they launch the
product but at least we know where we
could get Android 4.3 in the future and
speaking of Samsung even though sons are
Pichai pretty much confirmed in the
nexus 7 announcement that the nexus 10
will be built by samson as it turns out
we've got some new written documents
confirming that no apparently the
manufacturer will be a sous and infects
to wonder why I mean the Nexus 10 was a
pretty good product made by samsung last
year and we could assume that they were
going to continue that legacy even
though well the transformer lineup from
assumes is also a great line of tablet
so let's see what we get what would you
prefer a scissor Samsung I would like a
sous and speaking of the Nexus program
Taylor Wimberly which was famous for all
the Moto X leaks which were pretty much
controlled is now saying that the next
generation Nexus smartphone will be
built by Motorola and not LG as we were
expecting
this could actually be a good thing but
even better as the fact that apparently
this will not be a moto x apparently
this will be its own phone it'll be
launched in q4 this year so stay tuned
and finally for the annoying news of the
day now that Google knows that we all
rely on their Google Maps services like
there's no tomorrow the company has now
decided to push ads relevant ads into
the service for both iOS and Android now
these are not really as intrusive as you
expect they're actually just part of
your search queries and everything
they're not going to pop up on your
navigation or stuff at least not yet but
what does make this annoying is the fact
that we know that one of the biggest
battery hogs on Android for example are
the ads and we are expecting for this to
be a really big problem on one of those
apps where you really want your battery
to perform at its best but anyways that
leads to the question of the day how do
you feel about Google pushing ads on
almost everything in this case on google
maps and my particular case honestly i
do understand that a company needs to
make a living i just wish they figured
out how to make it in a more efficient
manner sometimes ads are kind of
beneficial but not necessarily all the
time so leave is a comment down below
what do you think of course it's always
for an earlier scope of everything
that's happening in the smartphone is
