looks to make up for lost time but is
there enough here to make the new phone
a success I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our quick review
of the Nokia Lumia 928 it's impossible
to discuss the Lumia 928 without taking
into account the trail blazed by its
predecessors particularly ATT's Lumia
920
indeed the 920 is the basis for the 928
and here in the states it's tempting to
call the latter device simply Verizon's
version of the 920 but there are
significant changes here we'll get into
that in detail in a future comparison
video and follow us on social media and
here on YouTube so you don't miss it
but for now let's dive into what the
Lumia 928 does and doesn't do well
starting with hardware under the hood
the Lumia 928 packs a familiar
powerplant Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 at 1.5
gigahertz backed up by a gig of ram
alongside 32 gigs of on-board storage
battery capacity is a fairly
middle-of-the-road 2000 milliamp hours
and wireless charging a hallmark of the
Lumia line works as well as it ever has
in keeping with high-end Nokia and HTC
trends though the battery is still not
removable and the storage is still not
expandable fortunately nokia has managed
to address one of the biggest black
marks against previous models the units
mass the 928 weighs in at a respectable
162 grams now that's still heavier than
its Super Lite flagship competitors but
here the weight combines with Nokia's
famously sturdy polycarbonate and the
Gorilla Glass to display facing to lend
the phone a decidedly high-end feel in
the hand that's only moderately impacted
by the glossy finish but we do wish
there was a matte option in white though
in terms of aesthetics the 928 is a
fairly typical modern slab it's a little
faster in terms of hardware design its
aggressive sharp corners contrasting
with its pillowy backside which balloons
outward to 10.1 millimeters at its
thickest point the casing is adorned
with some interesting flares like the
ever so slightly curved glass and the
love it or hate it for head bezel above
the display it also packs a busier
backside than previous luminous with
penetrate
for the new xenon camera flash and a
rear mounted speakerphone it we're not
too pleased with the responsiveness or
feel of the plastic side keys and the
top mounted USB port is as weird as it
was on the Samsung Focus and so there's
ups and downs here probably the most
visible change the 928 brings to the
table though is the substitution of a
4.5 inch AMOLED display for its cousins
IPS LCD here the change is welcome at
least in our view well its dimensions a
15 by 9 aspect ratio and 1280 by 768
resolution are all familiar the 928 334
pixels per inch kick out heavily
saturated colors with nearly perfect
black reproduction this serves Windows
Phone aids modern UI very well the tiles
seeming to float across an expanse of
dark glass in the default color
configuration even those who dislike the
larger-than-life color tones of AMOLED
will likely appreciate the added side
visibility of the 928 panel in terms of
software Windows Phone 8 purrs along
fairly well on the 928 we were
occasionally stymied by a hiccup or a
stutter here and there something we're
not used to seeing from Microsoft smooth
and consistent OS it by and large though
the experience is slick and stable
Verizon and Nokia have added their fair
share of customization here but it seems
unfair to call it bloat where as the
titles are big-name apps that many users
will find useful in addition to ESPN CNN
and The Weather Channel
Nokia has added many of its custom
titles Maps City lens and nokia drive
plus beta with the entire here suite
available for download on the windows
app store or via the prominently
displayed at highlights hub this
aggregator provides a nokia curated app
shopping experience that does a good job
of separating the wheat from the chaff
in the Windows Store we should also note
here that a customer investing in a
Verizon Wireless Windows Phone today has
a much larger selection of quality apps
than he or she would have even half a
year ago with Pandora Spotify and even
Instagram represented the Instagram via
a hack yes but the good one in many ways
it's never been a better time to own a
Windows Phone and the 928 arrived on
Verizon at the perfect moment to take
advantage of that
we tested the Lumia 928 on Verizon
Wireless over the course of six days
between Long Island New York and the
Greater Boston Massachusetts area
LTE speeds were good to excellent in
areas we had coverage though some more
rural areas stymied even Verizon's
efforts to provide ample 3G reception
voice calling was a bit of a mixed bag
the callers said we sounded just so-so
on their end but on the plus side noise
cancellation was outstanding
we stood next to a moving train
literally at one point which the caller
on the other end
couldn't hear at all we wish Nokia
hadn't moved the speakerphone to the
back side of the 928 it's repositioning
doesn't result in clearer sound and
that's a shame as we'd have liked some
positive trade-off in exchange for
dealing with yet another rear firing
speaker that said it's still plenty loud
for media viewing and listening and if
you opt for the headphone route instead
we can use Nokia's simple equaliser
software and dolby headphone audio
settings to hone your experience battery
life was in line with most other Lumias
and slightly above average for a
high-end smartphone with moderate use
including a fair bit of wireless
tethering and quite a bit of travel
across areas with minimal or no service
the phone lasted us about 10 hours a
more battery impressions in our written
quick review add pocket now finally the
thing that makes a Lumia a Lumia the
camera we weren't expecting to see much
improvement over the 920 and because the
hardware is essentially identical we
didn't but that doesn't mean the
experience wasn't exemplary the 928
continues to excel in low-light shots
and well-lit photos particularly
outdoors often turn out even better the
xenon flash is a nice add-on for those
who like using the flash but on the 928
it's so rarely necessary that it's
almost an academic addition the camera
isn't perfect colors are occasionally a
little washed out indoors and we
sometimes wish we could tweak its
low-light settings to get more dramatic
contrast also Microsoft really needs to
refit its viewfinder software to provide
shooting mode indicators but these are
minor quibbles over all the 928 s camera
is outstanding easily topping nearly
every other Windows
and most other smartphones period the
Lumia 928 is not the smartphone that's
going to catapult Windows Phone to a
massive gain in US market share it's too
mild too iterative for that but what it
will do of what it's already doing is
bringing what remains of the buzz
surrounding the Lumia 920 to the
nation's largest wireless carrier is it
a little light yes but is it a good
thing also yes we give the Nokia Lumia
928 and eight point three out of ten
