TouchPad and spiky hair were still a
thing and the pocket now intro looked
like this also in 2012 some tablets
looked like this I'm Michael Fisher and
this is the pocket now throwback review
of a tablet future that never was the
Sony Tablet P say the word tablet in
2015 and you probably picture something
like this hell even in 2011 the word
tablet conjured up a big slab and not an
oversized eyeglass case but that's what
sony delivered with the tablet P and I
wanted one so badly three years later
thanks to ebay I finally got my wish
and well it sure is something in many
respects the tablet P was a very strange
product and much of that strangeness
worked against it when opened its dual
5.5 inch displays did their best to form
a single the fairly spacious 7 inch
panel but the clamshell hinge
necessitated a big bezel bisecting the
screens sometimes thanks to optimized
apps this could be handy but more often
it just made the experience feel
bizarrely disjointed and the TFT
displays themselves weren't much good
either washing out and shifting colors
with even moderately off angle viewing
Plus this thing shipped with Android
Honeycomb a decidedly awkward experience
no matter what hardware it ran on using
the tablet p with this software brings
back all kinds of awful memories of
stuttering animations nonsensical
layouts and ugly icons I don't miss
troubleshooting in these earlier cruder
Android built to give Google credit
though it did get one thing right in
honeycomb notifications showed up down
below where they were easy to access I
wouldn't mind if that kind of logic and
reason came back into vogue as
unconventional as this device is there's
more to like here than you might expect
remember this was before the widespread
adoption of jumbo phones when combining
a small smart
phone and a tablet was still considered
by some to be a viable option for a
mobile lifestyle while it was definitely
on the heavy side the tablet piece
Hardware was and still is quite portable
our model here is the AT&amp;amp;T version with
embedded LTE so it could be folded up
stuffed into a pocket and then brought
out and used almost anywhere as a large
format smart device and it's strikingly
beautiful from some angles with Sony's
typical fit and finish and robust build
quality joining up with convenient
expansion features like a removable
battery and a micro SD card slot also
Sony's always been big on building its
own software for better or worse and it
took the time to optimize some custom
apps for the dual screen setup here
those apps helped the tablet pee bridge
the gap between tablets and netbooks and
in some situations the novel form factor
was almost useful like the Nintendo DS
the tablet P used its form factor to
enhance gaming and it sort of worked out
but there's a reason there was never a
tablet p2 and it's the same reason this
refurb only cost us a Benjamin on eBay
it's not a terribly great product the
corners are sharp on the palms when you
go handheld the cameras as subpar as
most cameras were in 2011 the speakers
are terrible and it's tough to get over
both the weird aspect ratio and the big
neutral zone right in the middle of the
screen more to the point it's just
really hard to beat the simplicity and
the value proposition of one unified
device as both smartphone and tablet I'm
glad I finally got to spend some time
with this strangest of all Android
tablet and part of me wishes
manufacturers had kept experimenting in
this vein certainly the modern tablet
landscape could use a jolt of excitement
but when you factor in how little added
screen real estate you actually got with
the tablet P and how much of a usability
penalty you paid to get it I don't think
anyone's surprised that we never saw a
successor
