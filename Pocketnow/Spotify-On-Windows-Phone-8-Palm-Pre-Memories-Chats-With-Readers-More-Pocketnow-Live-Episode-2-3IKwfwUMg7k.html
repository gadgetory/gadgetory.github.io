and welcome back to pocket now live this
is episode number two we've had some
technical difficulties but we are back
again thank you very much for all your
support for everybody wanting us back on
air we are here back on here i'm anton
denied managing editor of pocketnow.com
i have week with me Brandon minimum
editor-in-chief what I have Steven shank
chief news editor how's it hanging homes
like this is uh and we have and we have
I may be metal multimedia manager hello
everyone steven does that mean that i
could use the horns again you can take a
my out right here we go all right double
props and we must never first guests but
until then let me know guys how are you
doing how was your week so far so good
but I am scared to death of this
snowpocalypse about to torment the
northeastern United States and why are
you gonna blow away for all I need a
little drama every now and then I mean
Tony you get no natural disasters over
there here I get knock on wood I get
hurricanes volcanoes I get earthquakes
it's galore and sometimes all at once
yeah yeah so come on just rough it out I
don't on we're very thin-skinned up here
okay do we know if there's a queue or I
didn't do anything yet son I wanted to
talk for just one second about scurvy on
the pyrolytic now I'm written lemons are
your best friend lemons help prevent
scurvy I want to talk about something
aya I followed Jaime's lead and i
jailbroke my iphone fav uh and you know
it's it's different this done the last
time I i jailbroke was with the iphone 4
and the iphone 4 really had trouble with
jailbreak he quickly slow down battery
life went out the door but the iPhone 5
is much better once you agree I me yeah
definitely I mean the experience is
completely different it seems that you
know I still I have this feeling that
the battery
is getting a little bit of impact it's
all right it's got to have some sort of
impact but so far it's really improved
my experience with the iphone I mean I
there are certain things I and I'll have
a video live in probably an hour with my
top five things that I would recommend
as paid applications and there are there
is one for example call bar which is
like Oh God hey every single every
single smartphone manufacturer please go
higher the call bar guy what is it do
well you don't really need to go into
the calling application to make a phone
call just slide a gesture and you get
the dialer from wherever you are nice
that is like a logical I know yeah
here's a good question i mean coming
back for a second here have you guys
tried using evasion on the iphone 4 to
see if it makes a difference compared
Jim ya Jaane it doesn't work well on the
iphone it's the same kind of day of it
you it'll work um but a lot of a lot of
the apps crash so that's the wrong Liam
yeah i jailbroke my my son's iphone 4
and the experience it works but the
experience it depends on what you load
on it really so this um Jaime's going to
show this in this video but this osseo
task switcher is exactly what Apple
should do and you've probably seen this
on the interwebs let me click on myself
so it gets in there you soft so it oxxo
so it shows you five previews of your
open apps and these beautiful card view
if you want to remove an app and close
it you swipe I'm doing this backwards so
it's very difficult you swipe down oh go
there you go you go over to the right
you get play controls you go over to the
right again you get these bad ass quick
toggles and you get snippy and if you
want to kill all the applications you
just press and hold on any of them and
it'll kill everything else exactly and
I'm making I'm doing a bad job here but
I may seem to be much better job I just
sent a tweet out that we're
live-streaming we already have 18
viewers so I expect that number to
rapidly increase and we will hang out
with our pocket now peeps in our pocket
now readers are popular stop viewing can
actually join us yeah what's with them
yeah well yours join you're in
the jailbreak I am enjoying for today
Spotify on Windows Phone 8 ah sorry
Neely is it faster anything in the
windows phone 7 or it is miles faster
than on windows phone 7.5 it's not laggy
um you know what it's interesting
because for example if I want to play
something streamed on the iphone you get
this little bit of lag it's like like a
second or two and you don't get any of
that on Windows Phone on the beta it's
currently on beta it's free and I do
recommend that I mean I'm still waiting
on Instagram but Spotify is like good
enough for the weekend so i'll be using
b 8x4 this weekend and I see some
familiar faces joining us if i recall
well from great britain and from denmark
that is that right awesome so you guys
are immunity milk you know the lesson
from last week let's take it from my
left to right Henry lavender will come
back it's been two weeks hello Henry hi
how are you I'm doing well that is
awesome let us know what you want to
talk about today um I don't know I just
I've caught the cyanogen mod bug i mean
i've flashed on two devices in the last
week or so and i'm loving it so what do
you think what he thinks the best
feature compared to stock android um the
battery life when the device is asleep
it being it barely moves I mean I've
left them overnight through the day and
it hasn't moved like one percent is all
its content I mean it's just got killer
stand by yeah what else what else do you
like about it the fact that it fixed
most of the problems I had with 4.2 on
my Nexus 7 that's probably my biggest
point about it I like yeah I have not
used a cyanogenmod device in a while I
got the Optimus G I was using that but
there's no official cyanogenmod 10 part
I'm just trying to picture the stuff
that was awesome about it um you could
just configure a lot of different things
and it was just so incredibly stable and
robust I don't know whether I should
flash on my one x+ because I just love
sense some shine I don't want to go
through the whole
HTC dev thing and possibly void my
warranty how do you think how do you
think sense for looks um I like it I'm
sorry since five I was 10 5 I don't like
the new icons that's probably my biggest
gripe about it I I'd imagine that
someone that likes sense for doesn't
like sense 5 because sense 5 is kind of
the opposite extreme super minimal flat
layers whereas sense for has rounded
buttons on the keyboard rounded shiny
icons and that kind of thing I just I'm
just a fan of the extra features the HTC
felt like they're nice clock and the
nice weather widgets the only one thing
i don't like that sense is the weird
battery usage thing which is tiny
compared to the one on stock Android I
mean that's not useful at all is it if
you can see that I your screen
brightness is Oh better oh yeah yeah
yeah they should have kept it the way
that it comes with stock Android not
apply their skin to that right yeah econ
use I don't know you cuz too small you
can't tell where any big drops happen
awesome well uh very exciting you got
cyanogenmod tell your Nexus 7 we're
gonna bounce around here and we have a
new policy when we're done talking you
or it inject you so that other people
can join so uh it's good seeing you
again n roll I see you thank you alright
see ya I we have Michael from Denmark
good to see you welcome back it's been
two weeks how are you where's your bath
throne ah ah right yeah we last time we
really didn't get to see much bad phone
just a few a few minutes maybe we can
see more cool stuff of course again um
but I don't know what to say about it
Michael just just for one short short
second Brandon we have a slight slight
problem hai mei has been
a gift out of the coal and he cannot
join back so could you have an empty
spot you invite him and saline please
mute your microphone I don't know if
there's a way to get them in here I'm
gonna try with this white button alright
I just invited him so let's see what
happens um so um so Michael can you know
what I would like to see is I'd like to
see how the home screen looks when it's
on the phone and then you put it in and
then the phone screen gets like wider
and so okay this is the before this is
that it's all ya got four icons down
below some widgets in the center and
then here's the after totally different
that's interesting so it remembers the
configuration you have on the phone and
then what you have on the tablet yeah
it's it is different which is is fine
because you don't want exactly the same
all rights aptly then on your phone is
there a way to to set it so that it does
mirror what you have on the phone in
case you just want the same thing I
haven't found it if this one let's say
like that I don't think there's a way to
do them I shay yeah um what was this
problem of it I can I have a tendency to
focus on the bad things do you know it's
a world what works just should be there
but what doesn't work shouldn't be there
so that's what's interesting and then
the padfone 2 uses their own for 13 pins
virgin pin clock yeah exactly but it's
it is it does support micro sim but
Michael problem is that it is really not
ooh that's kinda like begging to be
damaged that's not good ended and it is
now it's in the middle it's charging now
it's on the side it's not charging and
no that's not good that's not okay I
have a very important question for you
Michael you got that as a
mo or it's free for some reason right
yeah demo and I have to return it you
have to return it would you after you
return it go and buy it um no why
because i'm waiting for nexus for what
was really cheap cheap as the nexus 4
and the nexus 7 i guess um I would it is
a it is a good phone the problem is
exactly that it is actually too
expensive um can you buy just the phone
or you have to have the tablet 20 you
can buy just the phone as as far as i
remember but i'm not sure what that that
runs that's the fun in that that is
exactly if you're watching now it would
be a good time to join because we're
nine of us yes indeed hmm the biggest
problem is i would buy this if the
screen resolution on this was better
it's pretty much the same resolution as
on the phone that's disappointing at
exactly i was like when I first what no
I don't want that because it's got such
a high ppi on the phone and then you
look at tablet right away and it's such
a contrast you know yeah exactly you're
just um your web page and say ah I want
to watch this on the tablet and then
what the hell happened to my text why is
the pixels all over I considering how
expensive it is now what would it cost
of that was 1080p on the tablet it would
be pretty laptop cereal yeah but but the
problem is how much more expensive
because it is pretty expensive now yeah
once you get to a certain point I mean
you might as well throw a few extra
hundred bucks just so it's really nice
more willing to to give some extra for
it and get a proper screen on it then I
would now we're just as what I don't
really want to use yeah that's applet
hey hey Michael don't mean to be short
but we're gonna kick you out now so we
can get some more people in here thanks
for joining us again man yeah while you
read me make sure we have enough slots
heineken come back to the call you
yes in dee dee all right moderator okay
so we have I'm gonna screw up your name
I'm very sorry for this I'm sure you're
from the Nordic countries Assad a
candace von Berg who are your already
read laughing so yeah that means I had a
great job doing that saying that please
unmute your microphone from the top
right corner icon there should be a icon
on your top right corner right I think
there are the pressures on or maybe he's
just like me and had his microphone
drivers all messed up even guys looks
like it's unmuted nothing happens yeah
well until until you fix your microphone
problem let's go to let's go to the
medical lamb James Lombardi a familiar
face from from the comment YouTube will
have to mute unmute your microphone i
have a missed it now yeah awesome
welcome how are you trying not to die
it's fine it's that's not wrong um the
first pocket now live when you guys
announced that you guys are doing it i
had actually come out of surgery about
three hours earlier and i was really
intent on getting on it and I was on my
Nexus 4 on the car ride home and I had
on that climbing I am I had on the
pocket now live page and I actually fell
asleep due to the amount available are
you are you are you okay you're covering
all right yeah yeah I'm recovering fine
and then like last week or late last
week I got this ridiculous like cold /
flu that's going around my area oh man
this shriek so I've just been like dead
so that's my voice a bit gone but yeah
anyways welcome and a speedy recovery
thank you talk about and i kinda want to
talk about bb10 I mean haha the shame
Michael's not here but um yeah it is
he's the only one who used it up close
in person
although Fisher sending me sending me
the bb10 Jaime hates me for that but I
thank you a good test I do i do i'm the
one that was supposed to get it come on
oh I didn't need like 10 hours to make
up my mind and then I'll send it to you
no not right then you'll send it to
Michael because I want to see it in
Barcelona and then hi we are gonna get
it after MVC I'll just complicated it's
just get in light so what do you want to
talk about with blackberry what do you
think of it I it looks really cool I
mean I am a massive like webos advocate
I'm always rooting for the underdog I
mean I have a pre I have a pre plus I
have a pre too and I have a pre three on
the way and never pre three on the way
how did you get yeah ebay even when oh
wow that is hot it's really very poor
it's really hardcore to ebay for a phone
that's old let alone on a phone that has
a dying platform come on really I would
still die to have a vir going to track
down an hd2 if I can find one in good
condition for what Tony of year could
probably fit your wrist like a watch
probably exactly that's what we last
about with Michael and Aoife he brought
me his AT&amp;amp;T HPV r and it was like this
this small in my head but I just love
the phone he actually gave my pretty
three that Michael cuz he was such a
women West banana okay you know i love
the phone it was just the nothing to do
with it really is i'm making phone calls
that was what i mean the the thing about
webos amazed it's just how like stupidly
integrated everything was I mean from
the messaging app you cannot sky was
amazing do you talk you could text like
for a flick of a button I mean I always
hated the size of the the pre-screen
apart from that one thing of from the
bottom of our screen when it slid down I
could still change every profile I mean
yeah I have baby hands so the nexus 4
looks absolutely massive but I do to
have baby hands yeah you have an arsenal
the phones now what else do you have
there yeah when you get uh I've got a
playbook right next to the screen which
is like why I waiting for bb10 see if I
can that's like that
I've got a glove playbook we don't we
don't hear much about the PlayBook yet
do you have you ever used in nexus 7 for
example Ike is the PlayBook better in
your opinion than the nexus 7 i've used
both time i have used both by really
want a nexus 7 with 3g yeah yeah I mean
yeah I mean I but I got the PlayBook
when it was super cheap here well i've
got i got a playbook when it was super
cheap here in the UK so I've got the 64
gig for 130 squeeze wait which I'm
guessing is something like where's over
a unit converter here like 180 yeah
somewhere around yeah some or something
like that for that capacitor it's pretty
nice yeah state they were up in the fire
shell um yeah I really wanted to get one
of those and they were on the ebay store
but I sold out like new under two
hundred and five dollars so i got who's
holding up the dental axiom oh god yeah
oh god we'll get there to the money go
before before we we part ways i'd like
to ask you something I know everybody on
the pocket now seeing their opinions I
want to hear yours but what do you think
what does it take or is it possible for
blackberry to catch up to Windows Phone
in market share or maybe even become the
third ecosystem um well I think they can
but that might also because i'm also a
blackberry easier you guys gonna like
hey we pull anything even my phone today
lovely Maria was no we're not I used to
be it Latonia and I used to use
blackberry for work in our previous jobs
and I I was hooked I mean I'm waiting
for that bb10 Brandon you hear that
right and I want to try it microphone
hey Nora yeah I I'm really looking
forward to the Z spin but um it's it's
so expensive here in the UK it nobody
got thank you very much for joining us I
will kindly ask you don't take this the
wrong way to you with this hangout so
that other people can can join I will
fight for having me guys say thank you
very much
for helmand even please pick bigger
person and dog let's see how can I see
your names down here sorry guys all very
new to google plus we're all new to but
let's see who we got here who is holding
the dell that you look at what i've got
here oh yeah and that's beautiful look
at what i've got here is the last pocket
pc other day oh it's so pristine have
you ever used that thing I have I this
used to be my e-reader before the ipad
man i just point out something how old
devices the screen is sunken in like a
millimeter can you look at that uh geez
no swipe gestures on there you rena d
remember the Pocket lint and all the
dirt which was around around the screen
on the corner suite I was used my my
stylist to pick it out I'm getting the
same thing though with the nexus 4 in
its bumper case all this dust keeps I'm
azz you can take the bumper off to get
rid of it but then I'm afraid I'm going
to have a Joe moment and we're coming
I'm actually going to charge this thing
just for the love today okay steven is
ok let's say you're like uh how about
who we got here Nick I'll Celdran am I
staying at horribly wrong me I'll please
unmute your microphone from the top
right corner okay hey it was it was set
up on the on the bud microphone um you
you pronounce it right mm-hmm I like to
see someone wearing headphones even
larger than mine are here so I do not
deal out no way a wireless you know so
it's serious the mic quality is pretty
bad mmm and we can hear you just fine
I'm really happy to be here just like
dominicano on the first bucket now I
really wanted to jump in but I didn't
have a Google+ account so I made it I
made it one specifically to join you
we're honored so it's very from hell
france france
oh yeah once the device you are using at
the moment and if she's here at 8x uh
yeah nice guys here we go here we go
yeah and and is fun fun I don't just put
if I i use i used zune and now xbox
music so i'd only i I've a zoom past
from the beginning so i don't really i
did a really test ask but if I you know
I'm actually gonna kill the service
today and the reason why is because I
actually activated it for the after the
buzz that I did on the 8x and the
service is great but the problem is
there were a lot of the songs that I
wanted that I had to pay for even with
the past I was like when wait yeah it
doesn't happen to me a lot but it's true
that a few miss mainly soundtracks like
want one specific movie in France that
really had a good soundtrack you still
have to buy two to pay like 10 bucks to
get the album even though you have a
pair so it's it's pretty annoying but in
in in my in my case it didn't happen
that much and honestly if that if it
happens I just don't load music yeah
another way so are you are there oh boy
no he can finally I already paid it I
take him having a zoom past this is not
your first Windows Phone device no no no
it's my actually my third I had the
yummiest even on day one I am a
Microsoft early adopter I'm us too often
disappointed but yeah so I I had the the
omnia 7 day one and after that I had the
HTC Titan and back in november i bought
I bought this one and before that had I
had energy to uh which I managed to do
so for a lot of money where is very
excited here we go here's a Titan there
we go okay me Kyle I got I'm gonna be a
jerk now okay what happens what happens
if you cannot upgrade your windows phone
8x to Windows Phone nine whatever that
hat
will you still be Microsoft fan I don't
know because I you know I'm i really
wasn't planning to buy an 8x and I was
like okay seven party is going to be
just fine for me and even though knowing
oh what's coming from with several with
with 7.8 but when I saw the price of the
EDX and I saw my bank account by anyway
so even though even we're like don't
have the money and and I'm not rich or
anything it's good it's the opposite i
I'm almost you know I had to pay extra
to my bank because I am I went you went
over your reddit line yeah well yeah
that's it so but I just love I just fell
in love with the with the design and the
color of this one actually yeah so I
really I really wanted to buy this one I
really isolated a long time with with
the night party but the 920 is so big
and so heavy for me that actually make
phone calls a lot it was just me what's
a fan you use your smartphone to help
people yeah yeah I do i do and and about
that i have to say something may be
specific about france that in that
evolved the last month's because you
know almost maybe not a year ago we had
to pay we were like one of the most
expensive country in the world regarding
you know phone phone calls home plans
the race yeah yeah and mb and because of
one carrier that that that jumped into
the mobile space everything fell down on
the price went really really low and now
for 20 euros a month we have unlimited
everything literally with everything
what SFL yeah they do it they dared him
to actually all the carriers follow the
delete because they had to they couldn't
they
can be left alone with their with their
50 bucks price so it's really really
nice now we can have a really good a
really good plan for or not a lot of
money d no no not yet we are stuck on h
plus but actually for me just fine you
can still watch you know 720p videos and
stream music so ya know and it reads in
Europe are great yeah I don't really
know their advertising 4g in big city
and pretty much in the entire country
for probably two thousand for 14 but i
can wait actually I would prefer to have
a better you know internet speed at home
than on my phone because right now even
on a 120 megabit per second connection
spin at home I still have more speed on
my phone at least you upload things it's
insane you I make videos on YouTube and
to upload a one gig video 1 Giga one
kick to it takes about five hours it's
my house Wow and and it's every year
when I go to Berlin for the ephah and
when I go to Barcelona for the mwc so I
don't like you it's it's really it's
really annoying because you have to to
to to have optic fiber but it's not well
you know establish in all our come in
all over city and I live in a quite big
city but I can't have it in my place so
it's really annoying for all that for
for that specific case because I'm se
book and Evan happy I was happy to see
Stefan because we we didn't see him
until now I think yeah I'm here I'll be
back he's the man ok yeah thank you very
much for joining us and we're waiting
for you and next week hopefully yeah uh
I try take my pleasure pick your next
guest ok George you're up hi guys ok
George I want to see that axiom what was
it the fire
uh this is actually the x51 I i had the
x51 video which resumed bluetooth but um
that got destroyed so yeah I got down
buried oh that was wrong the trip one of
the first PGA screens on that guy oh
yeah yeah definitely and that's amazing
otos about you George where you from uh
well um I'm Greek but I'm from what I've
grown up in London um yeah I'm 30 say
three years old and I absolutely love
what you guys are doing your you really
like ma'am you know it's great i'm a big
fan of well I've been a big fan of
pocket pcs for years and years years oh
I had my first HTC why was a no to mini
yes i think it was called really really
nice device and I was hooked from then
and I'm a bit of a Microsoft fanboy as
you can probably tell that wasn't my
nokia over lumia 800 Oh No alumium
rights lengthening winning I haven't got
the 7.8 yet but that's because i've been
using the 920 mainly so i haven't had
time to you know to install it on it
yeah yeah you're going to be selling
this I've heard the battery life is
terrible but now that um wow that's what
I've heard but i've never i've got the
spotify on this I'm a very happy man so
oh yeah we are we we definitely our man
I mean you know that that 800 was like
uh that was a good phone I love the size
of that 800 my wife has died got my wife
exactly the same one but in pink and she
was absolutely in love with it she yeah
she loves everything pink yeah I don't
show you just quickly my med she is his
she is unique if breaking stereotypes
yeah yeah yeah that is nice man and as
sad from Windows Phone I mean what
sounded are you using
um well strictly speaking not mine my
wife's what is a surface Oh surface RT
whoa what else it's not actually of use
around the house so the main thing that
I work in IT so I'm normally on a
desktop gaming or something like that
for surfing the web or something like
that it's perfect to get one to like the
work line you know citrix it's this
client is perfect for that so I've got
got no real issue with it could there be
more apps a few more games yes but i
think if you don't if you don't invest
in this sort of thing then it's never
going to get the ecosystem yeah and you
know the reason why i feel that the
surface is not taking off is because
microsoft wasn't really smart about it i
mean for example when apple launched the
ipad was like that is ok you can run
iphone apps here while we get the apps
working and that really was the segway
for the ipad to take off I mean what is
the difference between allowing windows
phone 7 apps to work on Windows RT I
really don't understand what's taking
them so long yeah um I'm a hundred
percent with you and at the same time
there's a lot of things on Windows RT
which is sort of like why haven't they
been brought into you know windows phone
8 yeah um or what hasn't why has it
taken this long to get um you know
Spotify on on Windows Phone 8 exactly
yeah it's exactly good good no it's as I
said I do i do like to support i think
that when microsoft pushes you know
pushes the boundaries a little bit then
they the others tend to work a little
bit better as well I don't think if you
know yes so sharing it mmm I get your
point I mean that the surface is a good
design it's aight aight i don't know i
tested it i used it for two weeks and
you know to be honest with you I you
know two things that I didn't like first
of all and everybody
was like you're on I'm like no I'm never
are I mean you try to hold it from a
corner it hurts I mean it's it's really
awkward because of the sixteen by nine
design but you know that's really not my
problem I biggest mom was launching an
app any app you know out of whichever it
would take forever it's it's a little
slow that Tegra 3 is just you know I
mean they're only one Z probably when
the s4 pro if they you know if the next
RT device that has the s4 pro or
something like that in it hopefully you
love that hopefully I I think Microsoft
had a great opportunity with that tablet
I I don't know but anyways George it was
great to meet you i am amazed at the
library of devices you got in ok that
that delicacy way i have a hd2 which my
mother now uses so this already have one
of these but me either everybody on the
planet has an hd2 but knees sorry that's
really fun and i still had the original
HTC pouch oh well you don't mint George
thanks for joining us it's been a real
pleasure and Men hope hope to see you
next week probably we got talk more
Microsoft a pleasure it yeah man bye bye
ok bye bye so up next I see this person
here waiting for quite some time Thomas
hi yes you unmute your microphone hello
hi welcome how are you where are you
from I'm pretty good um I'm from
Michigan here in states oh I gotta hand
it out to a u.s. colleagues system of
hours i'm talking to european guys that
you guys use just sold sorted out
between yourselves we'll just talk about
burgers and statues of labs yeah things
relating to Americans all made in China
what what phone you using time oh hey
it's true what phone are using now you
went mute oh come back to us um now you
were badly good yeah yeah yeah alright
alright iphone i'm currently using a
iphone 4s
did you jailbreak it uh you know I still
got a warranty on it so I don't think I
really will well wait till it's out okay
just you can just restore factory
firmware and doesn't know what happened
right okay so here's the deal with it
and and this is what you know a don't
jailbreak if you don't want to but give
it for the record here's the deal um the
the good thing about IO iPhones is
there's this mode called dfu um and what
it does is you can't really remove it
you can remove the jailbreak in various
ways but if you do it the dfu way you're
actually wiping the device clean so
there is no trace that the device was
jailbroken and you know whenever people
are like Oh what happens if I brick the
device well the cool thing about dfu is
you're actually forcing the device into
it so if you take the device to a genius
bar what the geniuses are gonna do is
put it in dfu so there's really no way
to brick an iphone I've jailbroken
forever and you know if something goes
wrong just place it in dfu all I'll film
a video next week for you and i'll show
you how to do it and there's just no
risk you know that's really the reason
why i jailbreak i mean i have a nine
hundred dollar 64 gig I hope ya and I am
NOT gonna risk this thing unless I know
what I'm doing and trust me there is no
risk Thomas I want to yeah uh why didn't
you get the iphone 5 I mean wasn't the
wasn't it so yeah I was really buddy
you're breaking up my sole reason that
Mike's keeps getting muted for some
reason I don't know if middle of
something here yeah i have i actually
had this for about a year and a half
right now so those before the iphone 5
was even announced or thought of so
social party until the next one's come
along before you upgrade was my question
yeah well i mean i'm i'm still walked on
like a family plan with my parents and
two year contracts while i have to wait
till adds up for another year few months
oh sure you get the iphone 6 well
actually probably not like uh i I've
actually gotten really bored with iOS as
i'm sure a lot of people have so where
are you going widow i'm definitely widow
lady i'm going oh yeah i'm going over to
android
I got my nexus 7 here i got for
christmas thank you oh I've been
watching you guys and learning how to
navigate Android and stuff I've actually
just unlocked and rooted my Nexus 7 oh
we're spoiled your toilet alright yeah
so yeah I'm definitely gonna try and get
like a galaxy s4 or whatever the next
flagship is McGwire yeah my advice to
you go Samsung I mean they've really
definitely want to Samsung or the next
Nexus phone yeah they've nailed Android
well they do well I mean I'm seriously a
love with Android thinks the same song

historic look at look at what I've got

loud and clear yeah where are you from
I'm from England yeah nice and what kind
of phone you using well I've currently
got the well an old HTC Wildfire s I'm
upgrade connectors for when it in a
couple of days oh but that that wildfire
was was cool the size of that device to
smoke he hold it up it's one of the few
small phones that has ever been yeah
that it's in it's like it's just you
know it's even I'm laughing I love that
design i love that design it's so
reliable when I saw this phone for the
first time at mwc in
and I was like what this is so small and
it was it was a cute phone yes it is as
it real that's it slow down over time
how do you find its performance now two
years after um let's just say absolutely
shocking now I'm click it it'll be like
okay Facebook's open yeah thank you
you're a patient person yeah I've had it
for about two years now and I thought
net just for you know when you have a
blow your mind now I know but I've
recently just got nexus 7 so yeah that's
back in seven Tony send me back by nexus
7 I wanna bet if I will bring it back to
Barcelona and Michael will bring him
back to you oh I'm waiting for the nexus
7 point 5 hahahaha man you know the
nexus 7 spoiled me so bad into the
7-inch form factor but again the screen
the display is just it sucks the other
side outlaw excites hurts my other other
than that it's like for me the best
android tablet out there oh yeah it is a
really good time but I'm just like so
locked on I'm always constantly on the
batteries always dry you know haha one
question what what games do you have
because for example I tried to load nova
3 on it and it loads but I don't know
the Tegra 3 sometimes handled it and the
only reason why I got the nexus 7 was
for gaming actually well everyone's like
nexus 7 or like yeah I've always liked
pure Android I've got it and sometimes
it will stumble a lot lalla my leg and
it will go through three it is that
Tegra 3 it's the worst thing on the
planet it's I mean today it was quite
embarrassing because I was playing on
one that 27 had loads of apps in the
background i always get too close my
apps and i was going on google+ and went
on to Joe Levi and it froze and I kept
you know keep tapping it try and you
know
and then it started responding again and
it sort of but really quickly and it
sort of tried to hang out from Jones
I'll God so embarasses I'm like oh god
so I always like really careful now you
know clothes all the apps hey juice
friendlyville mine yeah he's a girl yet
so that you're gonna you're gonna get so
much time back in your life with the
nexus 4 because you press on something
and it works so you're gonna have to
like come up with some new hobbies
because you have all this time to fill
yeah just just buy a case and don't pull
a joe Levi with it don't don't run it
yeah yeah thank you for stopping by yeah
thanks I'm Batman yeah thanks even
buzzing you're ready who do we got next
how about Dominic Pritchett here Dominic
yeah where are you from what kind of
device are you using I'm from Joe me and
right now i'm using the huawei ascend
g330 i just got it yesterday ah verse 15
they want one what do you think of it uh
all right for the price I paid a 150
unloved not a device that is a good
price yet has a dual core 1 gigahertz
processor 512mb ram yeah you're good
what recently she does it had um or 80
but if you do i connected it whaa WBA ok
cool not for me I don't think it bad no
it's not no it's not state of the art
but it's only bad money that raspberry
great phone no you got a good deal for
that phone seriously you really got a
good deal to you I do you have hspa+
yeah I do it don't point to an bitch I
think so yeah I think I think Germany
also has 4g yeah it away when i was in
berlin for the ephah we oftentimes got
4g signal we the phones couldn't hang on
to it but it
there yeah if they do have it but it's
very rare how much is your cell phone
bill and how much data do you get um
actually my plan is we i just pay for
what i call so i can call my mom and so
awfully and I have a flat wait for
mobile mobile beta and I get unlimited a
limit see ya guys good god that's how
much you want you know I know I'm gonna
take this opportunity because i know i
will be back in Berlin for the ephah
this year what carrier does offer that
that thing because I me and Michael when
we were in Eva last year in Berlin we
were looking like crazy at all carriers
and we got like 250 megs 500 megs I was
like no we need gigabytes we need to
upload videos many terabytes petabytes
tell me why should I look for who has
the best internet who has yeah who has
no caps on uploads um everyone I think
because it was not different at the
speed of different like he would if you
would go to telecom they will be the
fastest and the most awkward so most
reliable I got it I made a note thank
you for it you're welcome is there
anything else you want to talk about
with us mmm give a tablet no i don't i
would I want window but am I missing out
on much i'd i barely use mine he's not
serious sofia decided I bet he wakes up
with the tablet in his heads and he
falls asleep asleep each drooling on the
tablet his wife Esther I man will thank
you for stopping by is good get the chat
yeah thank you epic okay Jonas you've
been here for a while so let's talk
hello hey Jonas where you from I'm from
Germany as well oh nice thank you
so version um yeah I do have LTE here so
that's a nice thing oh nice which
carrier has adopted LTE um I think
t-mobile nah but several others t-mobile
you know it's just so interesting
because t-mobile is big over there but
then I'm in the United States it's like
it's a it's both hit or miss when it
comes to signal and hit or miss when it
comes to devices yeah and you wonder why
they wanted to get rid of the hum back
oh yeah yeah yeah so what device you're
using What's Wrong you got um pretty
much the phone that everyone has got at
some point the galaxy assume oh I
thought you were gonna say iphone 5
yelitza use you oh man we do hold it up
again that that is the phone galaxy s6
you get the jelly bean update uh not yet
it's the reason I didn't get the jelly
bean update is because there's two
variants of the s2 because you have not
good and the one with the GE yeah yeah
this is the one with the G and in
kennesaw yeah the CPU is different right
yeah it's not a Exynos processor it's a
it's a snapdragon texas instruments no
it's it's like the Galaxy Nexus variant
it's it's really interesting you know I
actually skipped the galaxy s2 of our
galaxy nexus and you know I like the
Galaxy Nexus and all but i really regret
skipping the galaxy s2 was a good phone
it was a really good phone it's a good
phone the galaxy s2 is still one of the
my favorite phones of all time because
it's it's still one of the thinnest
phones it's one of the fastest phones
it's got a crazy good screen yeah it's
just you could live with it it's not
like really dainty like a iphone 5 it's
a such an awesome much telling them what
i like about this is that this is not
like huge like exactly yeah 4.3 actually
allege against eyes like mine which
exactly and in the display was in
pentile so it was just you know you even
if it wasn't you know 720p well when it
was launched there was no sir
thing to 720 that was uh yeah and I
don't yeah I didn't really care about it
this way was so beautiful i just i
really regret skipping that device it
was a good phone and a thin phone it's
and press about them that thing was when
I when I first laid my hands on it in
mwc 2011 my first impression was this is
too thin this is too light this is this
feels cheap but I yes I remember Brandon
saying in his review that it was just
too thin to hold haha I remember that I
was wow I can't believe you listen to me
I only we always talk about how there's
this sweet spot in the market for a good
4.3 inch phone on Android yeah i rana
CLE it's still the galaxy s2 and it's
still being sold man it is and what i
want an awesome phone um Jonah's thank
you for joining us yeah good pleasure
wait it um I was have another form yeah
i want to show you um oh this may not
look like me a real pic resentful we're
running out of time I didn't think quick
oh my god what no good tonight is
running its ell yeah there we go
what no key is that the n86 oh god that
was a classic yeah it was like oh that
was a classic Morty food no it's got the
dial but it was a really good phone you
know that was the time with Nokia was
glorious designs the the quality of that
phone was great edit runs s60 yeah
that's what it was back then but you
know that was no Kim and it was it was
it it wasn't big it wasn't small it was
really comfortable was a really good
phone really really good phone I said
why delirious yeah you know well it's a
pleasure having you Jonas hope to see
you next week all right I will be here
next week thank you oh cool clear hey
man I see how the person who's been
waiting for quite some time Joseph a
wait one sec wait one sec holding on
holding on I may give your iPhone yeah
where are you at in the wait Oh God let
me see we're
this mailbox thing with the iphone I've
got I am down hold on it's dropping your
84,000 you're welcome by the way
laughter I am at 150 1400 and whatever
could you guys share the knowledge what
the heck are you doing this is hey Tony
we're doing this for you you are the
person that come that's complained about
google apps like nobody I've ever known
and so supposedly this is going to make
gmail awesome on the iphone and it's
coming to android actually in windows
phone and other platforms as well it's
so so what it is it's it's an app called
mailbox it's via startup and what it
lets you do is treat your email list as
a task list so interestingly what you
can do is take a message that someone
sends you and say reminded me about this
this weekend you see another message
remind me about that in two days and so
you have this recurring schedule and
what it does is it pushes that to the
cloud and literally sends it back to
your inbox at the specified time yeah I
that's why you're not answering my
emails I just push yours all to you know
never tell not definite indefinite yeah
Joseph welcome oh let's talk to Joseph
where are you from I'm from Cleveland we
live another US citizen what bullying is
HP pre 30 Michael had to be here Michael
is I want am I gonna be here anyone else
about said you here we go let's go I
also have the HP TouchPad oh god my
whistle so many time Michael come on and
we're watching where is all the market
share for webos devices there it's
plenty of users out there yeah now are
you looking forward to any of the the
new upstart companies like the Firefox
OS of the u-boat ooh that might give
your MOS underdog experience yeah i'm
looking forward to a booth oh I was
actually sad to hear that it wasn't
coming out until 2014 oh I pulled
something yesterday I
apparently devices are coming by October
this year so it should be cool later
yeah and I'm the Galaxy Nexus rom for it
comes out next note this month later
this month i believe yeah yeah her to be
all on you bunt too but the time next
month comes around yeah yeah let me ask
you passengers of so the app development
has pretty much stopped for webos right
pretty much yeah so does that is that
kind of a pain because you can't find
new apps or are there enough apps for
webos that doesn't really matter ah um
sometimes i like wish there would be
some new apps like you know how Apollo
was really bad in the blackberry 10
right oh yeah if it's actually it's
actually pretty good on the on the 33
yeah yeah the only wrong with the pre 3
is like you know they would have figured
out like an android emulator or
something like the blackberry that would
have liked kept it alive or something
because it was like one because of my
geographical location I had no contact
with webos until recently in August when
Michael Fisher brought me an HP beer and
chill off the web OS platform and you
know what I really liked it it's cool
that thing that thing could have had a
future it's cool leo the only thing I
didn't like about webos was launching an
app and then just getting that waiting
waiting I find ways listen I know we
don't pull out the surface don't please
no no no no no no I hate the surface
good oh man remember this all pixie
pixie it would've been forgiven you for
90 barks can you can do me a favor and
kick it out and press it up to your
microphone the clicky keyboard I'd
missed that III don't have the phone I
used to have the phone uh they just kept
the but it's almost as good you can
embrace yeah you know what what I used
to have was the treo pro you remember
the last tree oh yeah I remember that
yeah that was a good what is the same
design as the pixie yeah but it had
that it was windows mobile he has on his
mobile those were the days ya knows what
are the days we are running very low on
time I think we have time for one more
one more well as cool so Joseph thank
you very much for joining us thank you I
believe Stephen Foster's been here for a
while hello yeah yes we almost did at
unifirst I like me hey Mike we are here
yeah yeah sorry I had problems down in
at first you've got a lot of gear on the
bed behind you Stephen do you know just
stuff left out stuff like that familiar
on I've got a couple of things on it to
show though um yeh sure until I mean
phone then existed same as earlier on
nice golly beanies yeah whoa official cm
10.1 I'll that'll work better ap take
hd2 everybody has fun but nothing he can
do it by hand ebay tomorrow seriously
and Nexus 7 also running I cm10 Robin
10.1 due to the luggage is on four
points oh oh yeah I had mentioned on the
pocket now weekly the other day oh right
i hit my friend in and Michael were
talking about that my remember yeah yeah
so you're an Android guy that's that's
your your prefer yeah yeah yeah mainly
um yeah first smartphone was one of the
old ZTE blade or a fairing of the blade
yeah and yeah and rode all the way I
love the openness of it um same as a
famous joke really just if I can do
whatever you want with it agree they're
great android is the new windows mobile
back then there was windows will we will
we list it is i have here's here's me
being jerk again Steven absolutely had
to switch platforms and say goodbye to
Android
would be your platform of choice
question um probably probably wouldn is
fine I just like I not obviously the
open this thing is completely out the
window with that but as well but um
using it on the hd2 I like how smooth
everything runs the lack of lag that
well at least on the Android devices our
iPad I've never been able to completely
eliminate where as witnessed by
obviously is smooth yeah probably but
I've not never been a big apple fan in
general yeah just you know it's just too
many days on see some people do some
people don't it gives you the appearance
of being smooth but as long as you're in
the operating system whenever you launch
an app there it goes it's all right it's
amazing as as Michael Fisher pointed out
in the Odyssey review windows phone dual
for single core got 720p or wvga it's
always fast it's always a consistent and
that's just awesome about it and that's
exactly what what people don't seem to
understand when when they're talking
about specification Wars like androids
got quad core and soon octa-core windows
phone doesn't need that Rahul oh wait
smoothly go Microsoft baya they they got
out of the spec thing like the no I mean
people don't really talk about it except
for us and maybe some other sites but
windows phone specs don't matter as much
and then you can kind of focus on the
hardware do I want a really good camera
like on the 920 do I want something
thinner and lighter like the 8x that's
is that there's another brendan is that
the galaxy camera and behind you yes I
was ok you know it's so funny when I
show this to people I say this is a
galaxy s3 with a camera on it because
yeah camera hat on oh my gosh to the
 it's not cs3 with a camera on the
back hmm yeah and it's kind of fun it's
kind of I mean we've we've written about
this at length the next one's going to
be the one again because wrong with this
is that it's it's so it's like why would
you take this around it takes slightly
better pictures I'm like
galaxy s3 but you're not going to put
this thing in your pocket at a galaxy s3
okay whenever whenever they bring out a
mirrorless galaxy camera I don't care if
they charge me a thousand books for it
I'll buy it my problem is my problem is
paying my promise paying the amount of
money that a mirrorless camera costs uh
you know just to run android I you know
it's like that's the point it's not a
better camera that's my problem hey
check this out so when you get a call
and in the future galaxy camera when it
has a phone in it and and something
happens that's interesting you do this
the xterra you know your your lens
extends when you know you wanna yeah
that was about to say something but we
would have lost our clicking thing yeah
I think with that we should probably
wrap things up what do you say yeah
about or maybe a short short short last
one minute goal okay an extra bonus I we
shall do it thank you for joining us
Steven thanks okay really last last
person today who's gonna pick one I
rather somebody pick somebody well here
