pocket
and today I'm going to be showing you
the throttle lock 0.1
that comes from the makers of throttle
launcher you might be wondering what
this is well it's really a windows
mobile version of the android screen
locker it's fully skinnable fully
customizable and it's a pattern-based
screen locking tool I'm going to show
you how this works in the next couple of
minutes we downloaded this application
from its website you can see the address
on the bottom of this review we have
installed it as usual into device memory
so not just storage card not to internal
memory but to device memory after
installation it's created a shortcut in
the programs folder which you might see
you can see it also here it's one of my
recently used applications but the main
shortcut is in programs in fact you can
see it here it's throttle lock firing
that one up brings you the throttle lock
home screen here you might see nine
different dots which are buttons what
this application really does is that it
only unlocks your device if you touch it
in their correct pattern the default
unlock pattern is tapping the upper left
button this one here so I'm got not
going to happen i'm going to demonstrate
you that whatever you tap you see
invalid pattern whatever you tap and
whatever sequence you try it will still
be locked now tapping the correct one
unlocks your device I'm sure you want to
change your pattern it's the first thing
I did after installation and you can do
it by launching throat block tap and
hold change pattern it will ask you to
enter your current pattern which is
tapping the upper left button and now it
says enter your new pattern and we're
going to enter a new pattern which will
be like let's say a EU confirm your new
pattern which is the same one as before
and we have changed the sequence now
after installation this application also
places a shortcut in Windows startup
folder so it will stay resident in
and whenever coming back from sleep mode
your device will be showing throttle
lock screen and only will it's unlock
your device one you will tap the correct
pattern in the correct direction which
you have customized which in our case is
this you thank you very much for your
attention we will be back with reviewing
some other interesting apps here at
Pocket now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
