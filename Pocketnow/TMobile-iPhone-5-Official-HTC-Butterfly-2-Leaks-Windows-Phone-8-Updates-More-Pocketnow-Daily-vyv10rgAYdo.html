official and launches the iphone 5 along
with it an HTC butterfly 2 already
confirmed in the works and windows phone
8 may support FM radios if that's even
worth it I'm hi meri behna hitting how
it changes from sunny to Rainey from one
day to the next and this is parking out
daily news were all about t-mobile today
as they've officially launched their LTE
network in seven cities and they're
getting even better in the summer but
interesting enough they're also bringing
their own iphone 5 and notice their own
because it's going to be locked to
tmobile we're not sure if you can bring
an AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon unlock iphone to work
on tmobile since there are three iphone
5 models in the market and there could
be a fourth one with this move since
this device will work on t-mobile's LTE
network and also there are two bands of
3G network it's kind of weird what's
going on here but aside from that
they're also confirming they have no
contract plans that are better than the
ones they had they're also getting the
HTC One and Galaxy s4 as their LT the
vices aside from the blackberry z10 and
also the galaxy note 2 that you already
know about so stay tuned linked in the
description for full details on which
cities and everything cuz it's getting
good now let's talk about Windows Phone
8 believe it or not within their future
plans they're bringing FM radio support
to windows phone 8 devices on and you
have you don't know what FM radio is I
don't blame you it's something that a
lot of people don't use anymore and
windows phone is now bringing it but hey
the Lumia 820 in the Lumia 920 already
have support for it and apparently
Microsoft will make this available to
every other device that has this even
though we don't know which devices these
are and well stay tuned on when this
happens we still don't have any specific
dates it's just interesting how late
Microsoft can be and speaking of another
late bloomer when it comes to windows
phone 8 devices Sprint has just
confirmed that they will be bringing two
windows phones to the market the Samsung
at eva's which would pretty much be the
first carrier to support the Samsung at
eva's finally and apparently they're
also getting the HTC TR 0 which we don't
know much about except for leaks so stay
tuned you want to know which dates well
not even sprint knows but they said
apparently between May and June
you know how this works and speaking of
hcc like just confirm that they're
joining hands with qualcomm to promote
the HTC One since this is the first
device that rocks the Snapdragon 600 and
any sort of efforts that are put
together to have HTC promote their
phones is going to be welcome on our
book but then we have a desire p and a
desire q phones that are being rumored
or wait a second they're already
launched in the mid tiered market their
online nothing really big and I wait to
stay away from those phones I'm just
mentioning it because it's there and
finally for the interesting news of the
day if you thought that the HTC One was
their only wild card for the year well
think again you remember the HTC
butterfly aka droid DNA and how the HTC
One pretty much killed the buzz on this
phone well apparently the HTC One will
not be the only flagship device this
year apparently there is already a
butterfly 2 in the works or so says an
HTC executive that just confirmed so
just think about it I mean the HCC DNA
was pretty much killed by the one even
though the one is not launched anymore
nobody's buying a droid DNA anymore
because obviously they want the better
HTC One and now we get to the point
where we have a butterfly 2 that's going
to do the same to the HTC One eventually
so that leads me to the question of the
day do you think that HTC launches too
many phones in my particular case I do
believe they do I feel that they should
just launched one phone and then keep
the old phones like the HTC One X which
is still a cool device they could leave
that as the mid-tier phone and bring the
HTC One is their newer phone and not
kill it with new flagship phones and
then you can probably say there are a
ton of galaxy devices out there but yes
there is a galaxy device for every
specific niche it's not you know One
flagship hitting on another flagship
there's four specific categories not
everybody wants a phablet like the
Galaxy Note or the galaxy s3 which is
smaller so i feel that HTC should not
compete against themselves leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
yes of course if you won an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
