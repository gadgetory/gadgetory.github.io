only it's whatever proof well that's the
tagline AT&amp;amp;T is using to sell its latest
Samsung flagship variant but is the
feature trade-off worth it let's find
out I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is our video review of the
Samsung Galaxy s4 active when Samsung's
flagship Galaxy s4 debuted earlier this
year it premiered two reviews which were
overall positive but not perfect
we loved the powerful Hardware under the
hood and the large 13 megapixel sensor
on its camera but we weren't quite as
taken with the software gimmicks or the
glossy cheap feeling casing with the
galaxy s4 active Samsung has fixed some
of that in the quest to deliver a
lifeproof version of its top-selling
smartphone and in this video we'll take
a tour of the new device in hardware
software and some test notes our unit is
the dive blue version a very exotic
casing color that plays nicely with
sunlight and wraps around almost all the
way to the display making the phone easy
to spot though an orange flare version
is available if you really want to stand
out and a more subtle urban grey version
exists for you more reserved folks out
there regardless of color though you're
still getting the faux ruggedized look
of exposed corner screws and textured
plastic cross hatching on the top and
bottom with springy clicky buttons below
the display that look like rubber but
feel like plastic this device gets the
active in its name from its ip67 ingress
protection rating now the six means the
phone is totally protected against dust
and the seven means it's protected
against the effects of immersion in
water up to a meter deep for up to 30
minutes but throw the active in a bowl
full of water or drop it in the Charles
River as we did a few times and you'll
get a real heart-stopper as you see
bubbles rising from the battery door
prying off that cover provides a clue as
to why only the vital heart of the
device is protected the zone including
the battery sim and microSD card slots
and connection points the rest of the
internal volume is allowed to pre-flood
which doesn't seem to bother it as long
as you make sure to close the USB cover
and fully seal the battery door and out
of box sticker tells you that you need
press below the camera flash to seat
that gasket it's something that's not
obvious by sight we'd like to have seen
more robust protection here
like a coin turned tightening screw and
it's probably a safe bet that a lot of
people will miss that sticker warning
and inadvertently flood their phone
something the warranty certainly doesn't
go out of its way to cover in the hand
the active feels quite nice at 153 grams
it's got a mild heft without feeling too
heavy and at 9.1 millimeters thick it's
well balanced enough to hold comfortably
the 5-inch display is fairly readable
across most lighting conditions and
while you can tell it's an LCD by the
bright gray blacks it's still a 1080p
441 PPI panel and as such it's gorgeous
the 1.9 gigahertz Snapdragon 600
processor is familiar as are the 2 gigs
of RAM and 16 gigs of storage with
microsd expandable 'ti and 4G LTE
support and the 2600 milliamp hour
battery are standard as well but the
combination of these familiar elements
results in a hotter running device here
the active is not a phone that runs cool
so it's a good thing it's rated for the
occasional dip in the sink of the
swimming pool powering on the active
delivers few surprises Samsung's
TouchWiz skin is here in all its glory
bringing positives like utility toggles
and a fleshed-out UI to Android 4.2.2
and also negatives like too many
half-baked features something we talked
extensively about in our galaxy s4
coverage that said the active does
modify the software loadout in some
pretty interesting ways if you enable
the torch function the phone becomes the
most convenient flashlight ever via a
simple long press of the up volume key
this is something you'll use a lot more
often than you think and you'll start to
wonder why it's not included by default
on every phone fittingly s health is
still preloaded for fitness aficionados
s translator is here for travel buffs
and if you've got wet or gunked-up hands
and you don't feel like testing the
actives liquid resistance some of the
standard gestures remain for answering
calls and the like in normal use you do
need to get used to switching between
the taps and swipes of the screen and
the physical presses of the navigation
buttons but once you get past that it's
just like using a stock Galaxy s4
we tested the Galaxy s4 active over the
course of six days in the Greater Boston
area on AT&amp;amp;T the exclusive launch
carrier for this device coverage and
speeds were excellent in and around the
city as we've come to expect from AT&amp;amp;T
in Boston while we engaged in more than
our fair share of immersion fun out and
about with this device we didn't live as
active a lifestyle as we might have with
a truly rugged phone it's important to
make that distinction because ip67 is
not milspec and the galaxy s4 active is
not technically a rugged phone it's a
water and dust resistant phone so it's
important to define the word active a
bit narrowly when referring to this
device using the phone when wet also
poses its share of challenges even minor
water spray on the display renders the
screen useless until it's dried off the
physical keys don't really help with
this either on a modern Android phone
you really need the screen for anything
and everything and when the speaker gets
wet it loses more than half its
amplitude until it dries off and the
microphone stops working until it dries
off too so using the active in the
shower isn't going to work out for all
you hardcore multitaskers but Samsung
definitely comes through in terms of the
camera software which has been optimized
not just with its own aqua filter for
underwater photos but with new front and
center positioning of shortcut options
so you can use the volume rocker
underwater to snap pictures and start
video rolling and thanks to the water
resistance you can feel perfectly safe
taking super low angle videos or photos
just put the phone in the water it's
awesome those photos themselves aren't
bad at all indoor photos and mix
lighting are prone to noise and blown
out areas and have strange color balance
and low-light photos are pretty sad but
once you get outdoors where Samsung
presumably expects you to spend most of
your time with the active the 8
megapixel shooter is capable of some
really wonderful pictures with nice
saturation and crisp edges some options
like dual shot have been removed but
much of the s4's original feature load
is here including HDR which helps a lot
in challenging lighting scenarios it's
harder to get quality snaps underwater
but it's possible video is probably your
safer bet there though and above water
video is crisp and clear with
great color saturation and reasonably
quick auto exposure though autofocus is
a little sluggish as is the case on most
phones now the Galaxy s4 active doesn't
fare as well in phone calls even when
dry callers said we sounded just okay
and one caller said we sounded better on
the five year old HTC dream using the
same network on our end call quality was
average and so was battery life we were
able to get through a full day of
moderate use with the 2600 milliamp hour
battery and Samsung earns a pat on the
back here for including a removable
power pack in a water-resistant phone
AT&amp;amp;T deserves credit for really getting
the targeting of this device right and
it's advertising the Galaxy s4 active
isn't necessarily for outdoorsmen it's
more like the Galaxy s4 for clumsy
people or folks who are accident prone
people who have destructive children or
people who really don't mind the minor
sacrifices and features to get a little
more peace of mind if you took a pass on
the first Galaxy s4 for feeling flimsy
the active deserves at least a glance it
gains points for its water and dust
resistance but loses a few for the
camera downgrade and accident waiting to
happen back cover so the Galaxy s4
active
sticks with its stock s4 counterpart on
the scoreboard we give it an eight point
eight out of ten
