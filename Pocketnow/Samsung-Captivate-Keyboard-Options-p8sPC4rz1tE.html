pocket now calm the samsung captivate on
ATT has some really great on-screen
keyboards let's get to it okay so there
are actually three probably four or five
on-screen keyboards let me show them all
to you now so this is the first one the
stock one that comes with the device as
you can see it has a nice landscape
style keyboard if you have larger hands
or if you like to type in a larger
keyboard or you can revert back to
portrait and type here there are a lot
of settings with this keyboard so you
can have it predict or not predict so
let me try to type fast here kind of a
weird angle so the quick brown fox and i
really didn't pay attention to what i
was typing i just tried to move my
fingers as fast as possible so very
accurate indeed there are several others
here so we can tap on the little gear we
do the three by four keypad this is
great for people that are very familiar
with t9 text entry so i'm going to say
this let me start again I don't do t
nine too much so this is another
keyboard so pretty good let's jump
around to the next keyboard option
handwriting recognition we don't really
see this too much on Android very nice
to have you can took put numbers here
punctuation here and two letters at a
time so you could do th not bad a lot
slower than then using the on-screen
keyboard although it's nice to have if
you want to do one letter at a time you
can go over here do an e.r and you know
it doesn't work perfectly all the time
definitely takes some getting used to
let me show you the other keyboards that
come here so i'm going to go into the
settings and change the default keyboard
just by going to this screen here change
the default keyboard to the android
keyboard this is the basic android
keyboard that included on all the
devices it's right out of the nexus one
it's quite a nice keyboard actually this
is a pretty good keyboard
not too bad and of course it says its
landscape counterpart to so you can type
with larger keys and finally my favorite
keyboard here let's go back into text
purple not that one the captivate comes
with swype and if you've ever used swype
you know that if you get good at it you
can type really really fast so let's go
back to the memo pad I'm going to save
this and make another memo so we have a
blank slate so of course with swype you
don't lift your finger so you could say
the the the quick brown whoops and
sometimes it doesn't work but sometimes
it does you actually have to pay
attention when you do this the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog
and I'm just moving my finger around
really fast on the screen again if you
get good at swipe ask people that have
the samsung omnia you can fly around and
this is also a landscape keyboard
although he your strokes are going to
get a lot larger if you use this let me
see if if i can show you how fast you
can actually get
this is one of the fastest keyboards of
that mess that up have keyboards with a
bit of practice wow it actually got that
word awesome keyboard options on the
samsung captivate the standard android
keyboard swype and the samsung keyboards
which also have handwriting recognition
so five points here out of 5 for samsung
for adding all these different keyboard
options usually on an Android device you
get one or two keyboards with the
captivate the galaxy s smartphones you
get a lot more choices very nice to see
please thumbs up if you liked the video
