pocketnow.com
and in this video we're going to cover
the home screen interfaces on the
samsung omnia pro b76 10 again this
device is just like the samsung omnia 2
but it adds a nice slide-out keyboard
that we've been finding to be really
excellent it has a lot of surface area
which is makes it really easy to type on
so we're gonna start with the TouchWiz
interface that we've seen before then
we're gonna cover the new interface the
more professional interface that Samsung
has added to this device that I think is
is one of the best home screen
interfaces that is out there so let's
start with the TouchWiz interface of
course we have our list of widgets on
the left side here then we can drag and
we can drop them and they all do
different things for example this is a
photo viewer you can flick through the
photos on your device and bring it back
we have a music player a volume changer
again we've seen all these things you
can get the the weather on your home
screen and it says that you know this is
gonna use data charges and you press ok
and it's thinking no city selected so
you tap on that so these are really like
mini applications so I'm gonna press
press edit add location enter city name
use the on-screen keyboard very good
on-screen keyboard by the way if you
don't want to take out the full keyboard
Philadelphia by the way contrast is is
fantastic on this AMOLED display it also
is very good for with power consumption
the device has been off the charger for
well over 24 hours and it's at about 75
percent battery life which is really
fantastic so we're gonna go to here and
close and now we should get the weather
for Philadelphia and here we go right
knee right now it's in Celsius I'll have
to change that but exit out and it will
refresh and tell me the weather in
Philadelphia and of course I can tap on
that to get a full forecast let's bring
this back over to the side also on here
we have stocks we have Yahoo a quick way
to search Google and to launch Google
Maps
we have a calendar widget let's bring
that over which shows next appointment
which is fantastic
the Samsung Omni and the omnia 2 didn't
have this next appointment widget which
is very important because you want to be
able to see where you're supposed to be
in the next hour or two hours or
whatever without having to drill into
your your calendar application so it's
great that they added that and tapping
on that should take you into the samsung
omnia sort of skinned schedule they call
it it's really the calendar so we can
close out of that bring it back to the
side we also have widgets for Picasa and
for Flickr we have this strange-looking
smiley face which is actually just a
link to Friendster so let's get out of
that the device is very fast as you can
see it has an 800 megahertz processor
which really helps we have a link to
Facebook we have a little widget here
that just tells you what carrier you're
using right now and as you can see I'm
getting edge not 3G this doesn't have us
3G bands we're not sure if this is
coming to the US and what they added
with the samsung omnia 2 and this device
is multiple home screens so we can swipe
to the right and get a second home
screen maybe you want to use this for
work and another home screen over here
so you get a total of 3 and you can
customize the widgets for all three of
these home screens and down here we have
some other buttons really links that we
can customize if we press upon the gear
button we can add our favorite program
we press the plus button it will bring
up a list of programs on your device so
we can add ActiveSync press ok now we
have all of those there now something
that's kind of annoying is that the
widget placement gets all crazy when you
go into landscape it doesn't organize it
in a very intuitive way so right now I
have images below this sort of SMS email
and call history and if we flip open the
keyboard things just get jumbled on the
screen it looks really bad it's it's a
shame that they didn't find a way to
sort of deal with that a little bit
easier okay so that's the widget
interface let's take a look at that
other interface that I talked about that
I think is probably one of the best home
screen interfaces that I've ever seen
we're to go back into display and go to
on today and we ran uncheck Samsung
widget plus and go to Samsung today this
is a very old-school style of arranging
things on the home screen but it has a
lot of functionality and a lot of
customizability so let's get back so
what we have here is sort of various
modules that you can add and customize
so I'll sort of start from the top and
work my way down you can customize this
I'll go through that in a second we have
the time which is pretty basic we have a
way to quickly search Google which is
nice we have another module here for
memos which is quite neat so I can tap
on a memo and see what I wrote I was
just drawing before this is the memo
application it's quite neat actually so
if we go backwards to the home screen
and we tap and hold we can go to new and
you can either draw something or type
something if you want to say remember
the milk so we can change this to text
mode tap on the screen flip open the
keyboard and say see remember the milk
we're typing in pink text right now okay
and click Save and says it has been
saved and when you go back to the home
screen you can see the memo that you
saved which is pretty cool if you have
more than four memos you can actually
slide to the right now you can't see
that now but you can have multiple memos
probably up to 20 or so on your home
screen which is really great going down
the list we have tasks and this just
integrates nicely with the windows
mobile tasks application that some
people use some people may not use we'll
get out of that down here we have
notifications so if we tap on the email
notification we're jumped right into the
messaging application and we also have a
link to text message text messages in
call history down a little bit further
we have a link to our email inbox which
is terrific it shows you the headlines
are the subjects of the emails and you
can flick to the right to see all of the
additional headlines that you have and
tapping on any one of these will
actually bring up the email so you can
jump right to the email that you want to
see so it's a very convenient way to
sort of see into your inbox down a
little bit further we have favored
people in the photo context and you can
have
multiple up to 3 so 3 times for 12
different people to quickly call tapping
on any of these pictures will give you
their their contact card so you can
either send them a text message or call
them really convenient way to dial
people that you talk to on a regular
basis and down here is next appointment
and we can move all of this stuff around
on the screen so I just clicked edit
let's say I want to have a new
appointment down here up at the top so I
tap and hold I'll bring it up and let me
try that again to get it all the way up
and I bring it up and I can add and
remove things from the side here so if I
want to have a world clock I can click
and drag it put it up here if I want to
take away the memo area I drag that to
the left if I want to remove search take
it to the left so you really can have as
much or as little as you want on this
page there's also one for RSS which I
found to not work really well although I
wish it did because it's a really good
way to keep track of websites that you
like to look at and there's also one for
network and there's one for settings
let's see that RSS widget says so right
now it's streaming from pocketnow.com
and it's not really updating as much as
I would have liked I'm going to go to
the RSS reader and show you what it
looks like so so we're here we have
pocketnow.com it says please update the
feed you'll probably change the setting
to automatically update but out of the
box it will not do that but it's pretty
convenient to be able to have that
capability right on your home screen
without having to actually buy a plug-in
that does the same functionality here we
have the world clock that we just added
and if we tap on that we are taken into
the selected City so if we want to see
the time in Mexico City I'll click done
and then on the left it says Mexico City
over here it's a specific US let's
change that to Paris click done and this
interface works very well on landscape
so all of the integrity of the widgets
are preserved and everything looks great
on the screen they don't get jumbled
like you would find in the other
interface we just went through the
TouchWiz interface so that's good and
screen rotation speed is pretty good
about a second or a second and a half
now there's a bug
on the side of the device that says w /l
what it does if you tap and hold it is
that it switches from life mode to work
mode and the idea is that you can have
two different home screens one for I
guess the workweek and one for the
weekend although there aren't that many
widgets on this interface that make a
lot of sense for the weekend there's no
multimedia widget there's no photo
viewer so it really doesn't make sense
to have these two two screens and plus
it takes a while to switch watch now
we're going to go back to life it takes
about five ten seconds and that's really
a long time if you're trying to access
information rather quickly so overall I
think Samsung did a really good job with
this new Samsung today home screen I
hope they bring it out on future windows
mobile devices I've never been a fan of
the TouchWiz interface because I thought
that the widgets were always kind of
clunky and slow they took up a lot of
space on a screen that already is is
limited in space just by design so we're
happy to see that that for the omnia pro
there is this new home screen interface
coming up soon we'll talk about that
built-in settings and all of the
programs that come with this device be
sure to follow us on Twitter for more on
the omnia pro b76 10 it's twitter.com
slash pocket now tweets that's it for
