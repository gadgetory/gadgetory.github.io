pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review of the Amazon Kindle
here we have the Kindle in its case it's
a very soft material not sure if it's
leather yet it feels really nice it does
a good job at protecting the device and
it is secured by a piece of elastic here
opening it up we have the Kindle of
course now a lot of people were
complaining that reading with the case
on isn't a good idea because the Kindle
constantly falls out it's only secured
by these two flaps well if you read the
instruction manual you'll find that
there's a clip here meant to hold the
Kindle in more securely if you would
insert it properly and this is how you
do it
you slide it over to the left you push
it down kind of hard and slide it a
little bit to the right and what happens
is that the Kindle is in place and it's
kind of locked in place so that's a good
little tip I don't like reading with it
with the cover on I kind of like the
minimalist approach with just having the
Kindle here in my hand without all the
extra material around it so here's the
Kindle let's take a look at the hardware
starting on the right here we have the
next page button and it's also over here
the next page button and then above that
is a previous page button now as you can
imagine if I'm using the Kindle and I
want to go and pick it up I'm gonna grab
it from over here which may accidentally
depress the next page button and that's
happened a lot to me so I have to think
about how I pick it up before I pick it
up and usually I just grab it here at
the bottom and then I avoid accidentally
pressing these page forward or back
buttons below the page next button is
the back button which does the same
thing that it would do on a cell phone
it goes to the previous screen to the
left of that is a selector wheel it's
not a scroll wheel the Kindle cannot
scroll although sometimes I wish it
could and it controls a little chrome
looking selector here we'll take a look
at that later but this is uh this this
wheel here has a nice rubbery coating so
it catches nicely with your thumb and
it's easy to operate
now this keyboard is a very simple one
and you're not going to
can you speed record records by typing
on and though that's not really the
point the point is to be able to input a
few words at a time perhaps you're
searching for your favorite favorite
author or the name of a book and I find
it very usable there is a delay when you
type you'll see that in another review
that I'll do in a few days that when you
type a letter there's about a half a
second delay of when you see it on the
screen and that's not really a big deal
also on the keyboard you have a button
that controls the size of the text on
the screen there are six choices that
you have which is better than the Sony
Reader which only has three then there's
a search button which will actually
search many places at one time so it'll
search the book the Kindle Store and
Wikipedia if you want it to the left of
that is the home button takes you back
to the home screen and everything else
is pretty much standard here let's flip
it over to the back on the back in the
upper left we have the power on/off
button and the wireless on/off button
which I like to keep off unless I'm
buying something now in the beginning I
found it kind of inconvenient to have to
turn over the device just to turn it on
though you'll realize that it's as easy
as reaching your hand back there and
flipping it on just feeling for the
raised chrome button here and it's it's
easy to do so that's not that big of a
deal as with anything you get used to it
here's the speaker if we take off the
cover you can see the battery and it
looks like a cell phone battery it
probably is it's 1538 milli 30 milliamp
hours it's user replaceable which is
good here's the reset hole should the
device freeze and this is where you put
the SD card if you want to add a little
bit of expansion there just want to put
the keep the cover back on sometimes
this takes a an effort to get it to lock
into place okay
let's flip over to the bottom over here
on the left is a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack to the right of that is a
mini USB port this little guy is the
indicator light for charging and right
next to that is the charging port you
can't charge through many
USB it uses this proprietary charging
solution so you'll have to have the
Kindle charger with you no matter where
you go you can't just use your cell
phone charger to charge the device so
the right of that is volume up and down
if you're listening to an mp3 or an
audiobook I haven't done that yet and
that's pretty much it as you've noticed
by now the device is shaped like a wedge
and my guess is that they assume that a
lot of people will use their left hand
to read the weight is distributed a bit
towards the left and if you use your
left hand then you have access to the
previous page button and the next page
button the way I like to read is I hold
it down here and I kind of just move my
finger over there to change the page or
I'd lean it up against something that's
sturdy and you know kind of use my hand
to change the change the page like that
so that is the Kindle and a walk through
of the the features of the hardware and
next we'll actually turn the device on
and take a look at how it functions
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
