week I am now very big into everyday
carry I have an everyday carry youtube
channel called best damn EDC and it's
very closely related to technology
because many of the devices I do carry
our smart devices or connected in some
way but of course some of its not smart
at all it's not connected it's just
there for style or preference or just
because it's cool so with that said I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is my everyday carry for those of you
out there who are not familiar with
everyday carry it's literally what it
sounds like
the stuff you carry with you every
single day it doesn't have to be tech it
doesn't have to be a firearm or a knife
it could be a backpack that you carry a
fanny pack it could be literally
anything
it's the gear that you carry every day
the stuff that gets you through your day
and makes your day easier while it is
becoming more popular and more YouTube
channels and tech youtubers are doing
updates on their everyday carry anybody
carry originally started with concealed
carry tactical prepared mind sort of
people but it's sort of grown into this
this different thing anybody can have an
everyday carry and it has now boiled
down to just the stuff that anybody
might carry that gets them through their
day but I've been doing everyday carry
stuff since 2014 off and on and because
of that and because of this new channel
I'm constantly changing things out
so I've done my best to pare it down to
the stuff that I carry most frequently
my everyday carry technically isn't an
everyday carry but it's this is as close
to everyday carry as I can possibly get
because I'm constantly changing things
out so let's start with a wallet this
year have probably changed my wallet six
seven eight times normally I pick one
and I stick with it but this year has
been different and the one I have landed
on is the card caddy from hitch and
timber this thing is awesome I love it
it's made out of a really really nice
leather it's hand-stitched and it is
just built like a tank
but it's not just a wallet this also
holds my gear as you can see here I have
this right here this is the big idea
designed TPT slide it is a knife and a
multi-tool so if you slide that out you
have a razor blade or a utility blade
and if you dull it or don't want to use
it or want to fly somewhere you can
still carry this thing with you but you
don't have to have a blade so this is my
multi-tool I use this to open bottles
it's probably one of the best bottle
openers I've ever had and the dish right
here is a pry tool and a flathead
screwdriver which I most often use for
my camera as a tripod tool the other
side is my pen this is the Fisher's face
pin bullet yes it can right in space it
was designed for NASA by Fisher and it
opens up flips around and creates a
full-sized and these are very popular
among the EDC crowd I don't really write
much by hand but if I do I typically use
this pin these are probably the worst
sore point for that every day carry
community because you have things like
this this is my truck key it's separate
from the fob it's bulky I hate it and
there's not really much you can do with
it I just have it on a 90s beam or clip
to keep it kind of compact I hang my
keys on my belt loop for quick access to
those and I use this instead of a
carabiner this is the Griffin pocket
tool XL this is a big hunk of Steel it's
a pry bar and multi-tools got a bottle
opener different size hex drivers you've
got rulers this is a pry bar with a nail
puller flat-head screwdriver and a
package opener this thing is a beast it
feels really cool to use I just like it
there's no other explanation then it's
helpful and I like it and it feels cool
I hang my house keys on that as well
and I organized those using a key smart
pro this is the black key smart pro that
just came out what's significant about
this over any of the other key
organizers is that this one has a tile
tracker built-in so if you lose your
keys you can just pull out your phone if
you drop them in the couch lose them
outside you don't know where you put
your keys you can unlock your phone you
hit the find button and your keys ring
the other thing about the key smart pro
is that it's got a built-in flashlights
when you walk up to your door at night
you can shine this at the keyhole
you can actually find it but the really
significant thing about one of these the
reason people use key organizers is
because they allow you to keep your keys
in the same order so no matter where you
are or no matter where you put your keys
or whatever they're always in the same
order you know that this one's for the
front door
this one's for the back door and this
one's for the side door or whatever
order do you have your keys in they
always stay in the same order and on one
of these key organizers you can also use
little pocket tools I have a little
itty-bitty Griffin pocket tool this is a
stowaway version from clicker knives and
a bit driver which is interchangeable
between a Phillips head and a flathead
screwdriver and a very very compact
package but when that flashlight on the
key smart Pro is not enough which is
most of the time I have this right here
this is the O light s 1 R 2 baton this
is a 1000 lumen flashlight it's very
very small it's magnetically
rechargeable so it's got a little dongle
it snaps to the bottom of this thing and
recharges got a moon light mode so it
can be on and very very dim or really
bright
I can't stay bright for too long but
it's also magnetic which is really nice
you can stick it to the hood of your
truck if you're working under the hood
of your car you can stick it to that you
can stick it to anything magnetic or
metal and you can use it as a work light
or one of my favorite things about these
Oh lights they've got two-way pocket
Clips so I can clip this in my pocket
with the the lens down or I can clip it
to my hat and have a headlamp the other
thing I carry is this which is
technically a pocket cleaver this is the
sheepdog from Kaiser knives kind of
cutlery this thing is really cool gets a
lot of attention sometimes unwanted
attention big knives tend to scare some
people not me I've carried a pocket
knife every single day except for when I
was in school since I was like 7 it's
just a fact of life it's not a weapon
for me it's just a tool I use it to cut
boxes open cut
cut anything and everything I've got to
use or cut in a day which is more often
than you might think
I use the TPT slide from Big Idea design
for the boxes mainly because this blade
is interchangeable and I don't want to
ruin or dull the blade on this knife
which is a two hundred dollar knife
versus something I can replace for like
ten cents 50 cents whatever these blades
are really cheap want to wear every
single day is this one right here this
is the Timex expedition field
chronograph it's a really cool little
analog watch and yeah I don't wear a
SmartWatch anymore I haven't in maybe
about a year or two I switched to this
one which is the casio pathfinder phe
240 i switched it after the Apple watch
and several several several Android wear
watches I can ignore my phone better
than I can ignore something on my wrist
if I check my phone people understand
you're checking your phone you got a
message you got a call whatever if
you're checking your watch constantly
even now people still think that you're
in a hurry it's ingrained in our brains
we think that if somebody's checking
their watch they're running late or
we're wasting their time and I just
didn't like that so I stopped wearing a
SmartWatch the last bit of my EDC I have
two phones here on the table
really lately I've only been carrying
the iPhone 10 so I do have the iPhone 10
I have it in a moment photo case as you
may have noticed my thing here with my
EDC is mostly black and brown with a
little silver and grey sprinkled in from
time to time I love this moment case
even when I'm not using the moment
lenses and I also have the Samsung
Galaxy S 8 plus and it's also in a
moment photo case with the wood back
that's the walnut back on it and if
you're not familiar with moment they
make these really really nice
interchangeable lenses or you're home
and you've got to have the case to be
able to mount it to your phone they're
heavy they're big in there some of the
best foam lenses out there they're not
like those chintzy ones that you clip on
to your phone and distortion of bounds
of these are good glass they're good
optics want a wide angle or a fisheye
lens for your phone moment makes
good stuff I don't know if I would
technically consider this my everyday
carry but these right here I don't
really go anywhere without these now
especially if I'm working these are the
new Sony XM threes they're noise
cancelling headphones and they are
lovely whatever I'm doing
these are usually within arm's reach so
technically could probably consider
these everyday carry with all that said
if you're interested in this stuff at
all like an an obscure wallet that holds
a knife and a pen or a weird hunk of
metal that I dangle my keys from my
pants with yeah you might like the the
