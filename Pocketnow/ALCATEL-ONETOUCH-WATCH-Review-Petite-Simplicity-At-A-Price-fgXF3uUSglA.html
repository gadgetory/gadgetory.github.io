it at CES 2015 the Alcatel OneTouch
watch struck me as a poor-man's moto 360
at the time there weren't many round
smartwatches on the market so between
that the steel casing and the circular
display complete with the flat tire at
the bottom
it was tough not to draw an immediate
comparison it took wearing the watch for
over a week to understand what it isn't
what it is and what it might be for you
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Alcatel
OneTouch watch it's round casing isn't
as rare as it once was but one thing
that sets this apart from other
wearables is its size or its lack
thereof the 1.2 inch display is flanked
by fairly minimal bezels resulting in a
casing diameter of just 41 millimetres
but even though that's wider than some
of its Android competition on the wrist
it feels much smaller than any
SmartWatch I've used with the possible
exception of the original pebble now the
watch was made with an eye toward
affordability and that shines through at
some points for big screws hold the back
cover on and they're flanked by four
more screws keeping the band in place
that plus the heart rate sensor gives
the back of the watch a pockmarked
mass-produced look and the unnecessary
numerals and hash marks on the front
don't really do it any favors either
though it's certainly not alone in this
respect also the band attachment is a
simple fold-over clasp with no safety
tab or push-button release which gives
me pause about its long-term durability
still the clasp does a fine job of
holding the watch to your wrist for now
and while you might be inclined to chafe
at the stiff non changeable band you'll
change your tune pretty quickly once you
realize what's built in an NFC contact
point for easy pairing with your
smartphone and a concealed USB 2.0
charging connector that can plug into
almost any computer or smartphone
charger that means you don't have to
worry about carrying a cord or charging
cradle when you travel with the watch if
you have to charge at all that is more
on that in a minute
with the watch Alcatel OneTouch decided
to forego a common platform like Android
we're opting instead for its own
proprietary OS the company was going for
simplicity here and in this respect it
hits a home run
raise your wrist and most of the time
the screen will light right up tap the
screen and a ribbon of 14 boxes appears
most of which aren't apps but single
purpose toggles that give the word
OneTouch a new significance there's no
Settings menu
nor any need of one if you want to turn
vibrations on or off there's a button
for that same for airplane mode same for
screen brightness and watch face style
you get the idea the weather and health
functions are about as complicated as
things get and all they require is a
side-to-side swipe to see their
different screens when you're done press
the back button beneath the display to
go back to the watch face and whether
you sync it to an Android smartphone or
an iPhone the companion app is just as
simple and straightforward seriously
you'll have the watch figured out two
minutes after you unbox it give it
another few minutes and you'll be
changing wallpapers and watch styles to
suit your own personal possibly nerdy
tastes get too far away from your phone
and the watch will automatically remind
you not to leave it behind again it's
all dead simple as with any bonafide
smart watch the main purpose here is to
pass phone notifications to your wrist
as they come in and the watch does this
pretty well alerts are signified by a
small bubble icon appearing on the watch
face accompanied by a powerful vibration
that you definitely won't miss even if
you're not wearing the watch
swiping up from the bottom of the
display brings up the notification view
with alerts accumulating to the right as
they stack up some like text messages
you can read right on the watch others
like Gmail only give you small sips of
info like the subject it's meant to give
you a heads up that you have a message
not necessarily act as a conduit to
deliver the message to you well that's a
fine philosophy it's not always ideal
displaying an SMS for example carries an
unnecessary extra step on other watches
the text just pops up so you can read it
instantly on the watch
you only get a nondescript bubble on the
face and you need to tap it to see what
the message says it's only one extra
step but it's still inconvenient which
is unfortunate on a device designed for
convenience there's also no significant
delineation between some alert
vibrations a calendar reminder will buzz
just as loudly and insistently as a
phone call which gets annoying fast also
the list of supported notification types
is fairly short at this point and due to
an API limitation the watch currently
won't buzz for an incoming call on iOS
only for a missed one hopefully we'll
see those capabilities grow soon and
hopefully we'll get a few more watch
features - like a countdown timer and
the ability to set alarms right on the
watch rather than using the app on your
phone
personally I'd find those simple
features much more useful than a remote
camera shutter or a media player that
only works with the stock music app
those are some of the costs associated
with making a dead simple smart watch
there are certainly benefits - and the
biggest one is battery life the first
time we took the watch off the charger
it lasted over 76 hours of normal use
that's over three full days and on our
second cycle it's already doing even
better we've seen other watches beat
this figure but few if any had a
circular color touchscreen and when the
watch does eventually run dry it charges
quickly through that convenient
integrated plug
the Alcatel OneTouch watch has a lot
going for it an attractive design
straightforward software robust fitness
tracking and it serves as tangible
evidence that the company that built it
is capable of some really cool
innovation it works with Android and
iPhones and it lasts for days on a
single charge plus at 149 dollars
it's cheaper than much of its
competition but crucially it also
doesn't bring as much value motorola
recently slashed its moto 360 to just
165 dollars so for $15 more you get a
bigger screen higher build quality
changeable bands and all the power of
the Android wear ecosystem on the other
side the black and white pebble steel
seems pretty overpriced at $1.99 until
you remember that it has something in
common with its Android competition an
ecosystem a platform something
developers can build apps for to make
the watch grow with you over time right
now the Alcatel OneTouch watch doesn't
have such a platform to be fair that is
by design it was specifically built to
be simple and accessible and it deserves
kudos for succeeding it's just that it's
price tag should reflect that at $99
this would be a must buy SmartWatch at
its current price it's a little harder
to justify for more on the Alcatel
OneTouch watch tune into the PocketNow
