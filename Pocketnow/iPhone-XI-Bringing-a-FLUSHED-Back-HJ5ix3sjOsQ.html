us what to expect for the new 2019
iPhones oh boy just released a new
teaser with their new business phone
with the camera under the display and
Samsung's executives may have confirmed
the timeline for the note on the fold
and they're actually not the same I'm
highlighting that I'm reporting from
Tokyo Japan it's been my dream to be
here and there's some content coming
from here that's awesome this is fogging
out daily the official loose today begin
with deals of you're in the market for
Amazon echoes there's truly a deal for
the Amazon echoes sub meaning you get
the sub which is the subwoofer and you
get the third-generation echoes or
second-generation echoes I believe all
in a bundle for $250 it is a really good
deal if you consider the fact that
you're pretty much saving 80 bucks and
you get a lot of entertainment there you
can learn more about them in the
description now let's talk about well
the future of MacBook Pros as we were
expecting to get new designs right now
at WWDC but instead we got updates
interesting apparently that 16 inch
MacBook Pro is apparently still gonna
happen and there's a possibility that it
could be launched during the iPhone
event meeting sometime in September so
set your calendars up there are rumors
that we're getting OLED screens on this
thing but then the report actually
claims LCDs from LG so we hope they make
up their mind now let's move the
spotlight to another thing that could
happen in September and that is the
huawei mate X it was recently showcased
a couple of my friends were able to see
it at New York City and well we've got
confirmation that it will run Android
that we could see a September launch and
that it could end up actually launching
earlier there are possibilities that
that could happen obviously we don't
have specific dates of what's important
is that it will run Android which is
interesting let's see exactly if there
are going to be any restrictions or
anything because again the company has
the bunk that there is nothing to worry
about
according to their website now there is
a little timeline to be looking forward
to and that is the galaxy note tender
mercy a launch of the note 10 with the
fold and that it could be launching in
early August now according to certain
sources well we could see a launch of
the fold before the note and if that
happens then apparently the note is
going to be
laid and it's going to be delayed to get
the full the little time to breathe we
were hearing early August for possible
launch now we're hearing that well it'll
all depends on the fold and there are no
dates for the fold so stay tuned the
problem with these unpacked events is
they let you know like so late that it's
really hard to speculate and for those
of you that have been looking forward to
everything that oboes been doing with
displays lately we've seen the shark fin
on the open e know which I'm about to
play with right now we've seen for
example the Oppo n liner but that flip
camera with a remote control that I
actually loved even though the camera
wasn't really great we've seen the Oppo
find X and now the company is teasing
that this film that we should see in the
next two days is apparently going to
bring the you know the camera inside the
display and it's gonna affect quality we
reported on this we've got a new teaser
showing you exactly how it'll look it
seems that there is no bezels on this
display looks really interesting
hopefully it does deliver we'll see and
finally the hottest editions do they
have to do with iPhone 11s and what to
expect with the design we've got some
case leaks and they're interesting
because first of all it seems that the
meat slider is going to change in its
design it reminds me more of what we saw
with the iPhone I think that was the
iPhone 4 and the buttons not the meat
slider but yeah
iPads actually the original no no the
second generation iPads have this like
really interesting circular mute slider
and so that's apparently going to come
and then another one is that apparently
there's gonna be only one sheet of glass
that's going to even cover the camera
hump meaning that it could be that there
is no camera which would be fantastic
but the cases show that there will be so
let us know in the comments down below
what do you think about this possible
iPhone designs you like it do you not
like it because in my case it looks okay
I mean it looks how my god it's just
that still design looks so weird to me
but that's my opinion we would love to
know what you think in the comments down
below
