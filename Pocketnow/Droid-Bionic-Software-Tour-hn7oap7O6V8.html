and today we're going to talk about the
motorola droid bionic show you a little
bit about how it performs and some of
the software that comes with let's go
take a look alright so since the major
selling point behind this phone is well
in addition to its large gorgeous screen
is also its dual core processor let's
jump right into performance and see how
it performs in some of the benchmarks a
couple things I want to show you first
let's do linpack here's what it ran
before which took about 3.9 seconds and
it gave us 43.2 26 mega flops when
running in multi-threaded we'll go ahead
and run that really fast because it only
takes a few seconds to run it you can
see right there again mega flux 42.8 a 5
if we run that in a single thread it's
going to take a little bit longer
theoretically about twice as long but we
still get a really really good score
even though we have a inaccurate result
which happens occasionally when we're
running this particular benchmark
running it again you can see that we've
got our precision back so overall very
very fast device let's jump over to
quadrant and since quadrant takes a
little while to run I'm also going to
jump into telling you about what
benchmark things are and do because
there's a little bit of a debate going
on out there about them so a benchmark
is a high watermark it is essentially
how fast is this device perform a
predetermined set of tests and you can
see some of the graphics tests going
through right now compared to another
device running the same tests now the
difference there is the other device has
a different set of hardware than this
device so since the tests are all the
same the theory follows that the
benchmarking results will simply show
let me pause from and you see right in
here we've got some graphic anomalies on
this little planet just point that out
in the benchmark but the benchmarking
will then essentially show the speed
differences between the two devices
being compared now that doesn't play out
entirely true fact right here you can
see my benchmark score is about 2,500
that's about the same that I get with my
t-mobile g2 overclocked to 1.5 gigahertz
which is a single core by the way you
think so what we've got with
benchmarking is a device that doesn't
perform nearly as well as it should now
when I say should I mean that's an
implication that this device should be a
lot faster not to say it's not this
device is ridiculously fast but in the
Mensch marking I'd expect to see this at
least into the 3000's which of course is
the drawback of benchmarks this
benchmarking utility in fact most of
them don't take full advantage of the
hardware that comes out the brand new
stuff so in this case it would be the
the dual core processor let me show you
something else that it doesn't take
advantage of and it's really kind of
funny smart bench 2011 is another one of
the benchmark utilities that we use
takes a minute to load up and on this
device I get an ad and it's almost
always a dating ad I don't know why
smart bench has so many dating ads on it
but I don't have any way to start the
test if I come down here that's going to
take me over to the market for that ad I
tap around sometimes I can get it to run
every time I've been able to get this to
run just by kind of randomly tapping and
trying to get it to run it'll run but
then I can never get the results back so
we're going to have to give this one it
did not finish because it didn't finish
the benchmark but that's because of the
screen resolution that this is a very
large nice screen for the specifics make
sure you head over to pocketnow.com so
you can see the stats on just exactly
how big this screen is and we'll go from
there alright so let's run through a
browser test I've got pocketnow.com
queued up to run on each one of these
three devices will hit Go Go and go at
the same time as close as we can there
and the motorola droid bionic will set
up really quickly t-mobile g2 shortly
after unfortunately on the HTC I think I
did a Google search instead of doing an
actual run so we'll go ahead and open
that up over here so one of the things
that the Wildfire s is a little
but interesting about but overall you
can see how quickly they came up this is
over 80 to 11 and Wi-Fi and it's just
really really fast let's go ahead and
see how fast it loads the desktop
version try and start these two at the
same time and the middle one will start
after now the desktop version of our
site is a lot larger a lot heavier than
the mobile version and well I think you
know why overall though you can see just
how much faster you're faster phones on
this side run compared to the Wildfire s
we're all almost entirely complete over
here with the the Bionic the g2 is
coming in really closely it's both sides
are functional we've got flash that's
pre-loading and running smoothly and
we're still kind of trying to get there
over with the Wildfire s now as you can
see over here i'm on a 3g network
connection and i'm also on Wi-Fi with
almost full bars let's go ahead and run
a speed test against that Wi-Fi just so
you can see how fast it runs the first
thing that I noticed about running
speedtest.net by koukla is just how fast
it runs on this device starting it up
running it I the whole thing animations
everything is a lot smoother even than
my overclocked g2 it's ridiculously fast
the ping times over my Wi-Fi here 18
milliseconds that's really really low
15.7 to megabit per second down 4.09
megabit per second up just ridiculously
fast let me go ahead and toggle the
Wi-Fi off we're going to try that again
over 3g now this is an LTE device I'm
not under an LTE umbrella so I'm just
going to have to tell you what those
speeds are but we'll run the same test
again under 3g just so you can get a
feel about how fast it is over a
traditional 3g network alright I've
turned off the Wi-Fi we're going to
restart the test under verizon 3g
testing the ping first the ping is how
fast you ask for something before you
get a reply back here you can see we're
at 181 milliseconds most wireless
carriers that I've
have been right around there anything
below 300 is usually acceptable anything
above that you're getting a little bit
slow t-mobile has been a bit faster than
that 181 milliseconds they're usually in
the double digits and usually the low
double digits download speed we can see
there we've got a point for two megabit
per second upload it looks like it's
going to be a little bit less than one
megabit per second that's not that great
but it's not common for what I usually
see I'm going to run the test here again
for you just so we can get a good
baseline normally I'm running right
around 11.2 megabit per second down and
that up speed is this pretty
representative of what i normally get
we'll run that one more time just so you
can see the results of two tests run
back-to-back so here are the results of
that next test and they're not all that
indicative of what I was hoping to show
you we've got point 39 megabit per
second up and point 84 megabit per
second down while I'm describing my
experience with a 4g LTE will let that
run again normally you'll see your
download speeds about double sometimes
not quite double your upload speeds and
that's just the asynchronous nature of
internet connections that we normally
have these days luckily I'm about 20-30
minutes away from a 4G LTE bubble and
I've never been able to get full bars
but I've always had two or three out of
four so it hasn't been too bad the test
that I've run over there on those
locations have been in line with what
I'd expect 4G to be it's about three to
five megabit per second down about one
and a half bag a bit per second up and
that's in line with the t-mobile hspa+
in the same areas I was expecting LTE to
be ridiculously fast speed of lightning
all kinds bells and whistles
unfortunately that hasn't been my
experience but it may be closer to that
where you live but definitely 4G LTE is
amazing now one thing I want to mention
3g is over cdma now the cdma network and
the GSM networks are very different
verizon has done an awful lot
with their cdma network they're kind of
abandoning that for LTE in my opinion
but there is an inherent little caveat
that you may want to take into
consideration with 3g or even to g /
cdma and that is when i'm driving down
the road i normally pick out my favorite
navigation app waze big shout out to you
guys there which now has advertisements
but i'm usually driving down the road
with this up so that i can see what the
traffic is where I'm where I'm headed
where I'm going and I can also report
stuff as I see it accidents cops
whatever it may be this uses a data
connection to pull that data down into
bring the maps into place and to show me
those those alerts like you were just
seeing on the screen when i get a phone
call which I do quite often in the car I
have that over Bluetooth because you
might bluetooth is on and I have my car
kit set up so that I can just take those
calls right there in the car no headset
needed and I go ahead and make those
calls and driving down the road of
course being safe but while I'm on the
call I don't have data coming in as long
as I'm on 3g LTE is different but when i
want 3g and i'm on a call I don't have
any data now that is kind of a
disconnect that has has caused some
hangs and some issues with various apps
when i go back to them after getting off
the phone call because now it's got to
reconnect to the data network and make
that work so just a little bit of an
inconvenience there nothing major but it
is something to mention about the phone
next let's get into the apps that come
with this now first of all you're going
to notice this is not the stock Android
experience this is kind of a motoblur
kind of a droid kind of a bionic thing
it's it's fresh its new and it's subtle
I don't particularly like custom
launchers that's just me I prefer raw
core pure Android I think that's what
google intended and I think that any
device manufacturer who tries to add to
that is taking away from the experience
away from the brand that is Android and
taking away well speed because it's
stuff on top of the the stock interface
that we're all used to so let's spend a
little bit of time looking at this
interface for those of you who haven't
seen it if you've got a droid you're
probably familiar with a lot of the
stuff that i'm going to show you but for
your friends who may not know let me
show you first of all we've got this
really nice i'm already at the end over
there so let's scroll this way if you
notice here we've got this cool layered
effect i've got a live wallpaper in the
background that had some 3d but as you
move you'll notice I've got a nice Sheen
across my widgets and across my icons a
nice reflective animation that just adds
a little bit of polish as I scroll the
icons down here will kind of bunch up
together and you've got kind of an
unfolding kind of a stacking on top of
each other animation to how you're
changing pages on here now this is a
five page layout some others like mine
have seven some have 3some have one
whatever you need to use there you go
this is has five and it's been plenty
for me but it feels really nice let's go
ahead and check out some other things if
I pull down the notification tray you
can see I've got a very nice gradient
more translucent to be at the bottom
then at the top I don't have any of the
HTC hot tasks if you will running up in
the top and it's a little bit
unfortunate I'd like to be able to
toggle some of my my radios my Wi-Fi my
airplane mode and whatnot up here or
even have a recent applications up here
like some of the HTC Sense devices do or
some of the cyanogen mods do but I don't
and it really that hasn't been a problem
it's been just one of those things that
I kind of kind of miss a little bit now
what you're not seeing here is a series
of alerts or notifications I have none
at this time so I can't really show you
that but I'll get you a view of that
here in just a minute let's go ahead and
fire up the the dialer the dialer is
kind of
a different look on it's got nice big
buttons it feels very much in theme with
what we have in the other devices and
really the theme that's across this
device it's just a nice consistent UI
overlay let's jump into the launcher now
i have installed some of my own apps on
here and i'll just brief over what the
apps are that come with the device just
so you can kind of tell them apart but
let's look at this first you'll notice
we've got some little drop down shadows
at the bottom just to give kind of a 3d
effect this is a horizontal scroll or an
a a vertical scroller like we are
accustomed to and you can kind of see
there the cube like 3d effect when we
change pages go ahead and exit out of
that if we can alright so let's go back
let's touch on on what we have kind of
stock that comes with the device alarm
and timer obviously amazon kindle is an
app that comes pre-installed the
blockbuster app as well browser I don't
like the icon for browser although it
looks just like a browser it's just kind
of a disconnect we're used to a globe
calendar is pretty much the stock
Android calendar there's calculated
rather calendar you can start to see
some of the some of the more subtle
effects from droid let me get you over
to a just a rock calendar look if we
look up here you can see I've got this
little plus sign and a little bit of
information now this is where you start
to see some of that droid bionic theming
come into play when you have
notifications they look like this
whether that's a download whether that's
an email a text message you've got what
it is and then a little dismiss button
over on the side well this obviously is
an Add button but it looks very similar
it's it's subtle it's simple its elegant
and I'm really impressed with it they've
done a very good job at incorporating
that through the entire OS even over
here you can see I've got my whatever it
is up on the top and then I nice
icon over the side an action icon in
more or less the same look and feel even
when I come in here to my recent
applications it looks just like what
you'd expect it to look like it's not a
different UI metaphor so kind of kind of
nice there it's just a different view of
your apps really it's not a little
pop-up block like it is on some of the
Android devices that come with stock
Android back to the apps that come with
this camcorder and camera are separate
separate icons essentially the same app
does take a little bit of time to load
but this camcorder will do 1080p HD
video and it does so amazingly we've got
a sample video over at pocketnow.com you
can go and look at we'll have a link to
that in the final review for this phone
as well so you can see what it looks
like and over all the comments have been
remarkably positive so it's not just a
bias on my part your peers are thinking
that this camcorder is quite amazing the
camera can do either 8 megapixel or 6
megapixel widescreen I've got some 8
megapixel live images raw images that
will have up in the final review as well
so you can see how that looks both on
macro and micro and well all kinds of
different shots that I could pull out
for you Citrix is kind of cool Citrix is
essentially lets you connect to other
computers this is a remote desktop
client and that lets you work from your
phone that really comes into play when
you've got some accessories and when
you're on an LTE network the accessories
include the atrix style laptop dock if
you will it gives you a keyboard and
that monitor and whatnot and unless you
use your phone as a laptop you also have
a dock that you can acquire that lets
you do the same thing to to a monitor
keyboard mouse and whatnot so very cool
their city ID is an app that I like it's
kind of an afterthought but I really
like this when you get a phone call and
don't know who it's from this will look
up their caller ID and tell you what
city and state they're calling from or
where that phone number is registered in
so really nice if you don't have caller
ID for them a name caller ID
be and just a phone number it can help
you know well oh that's my friends from
Mesa Arizona okay great contacts our
contacts I've got a whole ton of them
but you've got this whole interface
again that's the same across all of the
customizations that Motorola has made so
very nice looking there let's keep going
through here knife it back one too many
times device setup I'll show you that in
just a minute that's really the
walkthrough of how you get everything
set up on the device it's a very smooth
and fluid process I like it quite a bit
DLNA it lets you connect to and serve as
a DLNA a digital living network alliance
I believe is what that stands for server
or client it lets you share photos and
supported videos across various and
devices on your network that could be a
picture frame that could be a TV that
could be a computer in my case it's a
windows media center unfortunately the
format in which the videos are recorded
for my windows media center are not
playable back here on the on the phone
but I kind of expected that it's a
proprietary format my home videos stuff
that i have in just regular formats play
just fine over my Wi-Fi to the phone
it's really kind of cool with a little
bit of lag to show the libraries but
that's kind of understandable downloads
we all know what that is email is their
implementation of email and I'll show
you just really quick here same look and
feel with how many new items you have a
really really nice implementation of the
stock email client that comes with the
with most devices to be able to get non
gmail emails Facebook app it didn't come
with but it comes with a Facebook
connector files is a file browser lets
you look into your file system and
getting stuff does it come stock with a
lot of devices it does come stock with
this photo gallery gmail we know what
those are at Google search we know what
that is gotomeeting is essentially a
meeting client lets you share at least
the desktop version once you share your
desktop and also audio and video and
whatnot i believe this version that does
just the screenshots and
that's just fine with me guided tours is
a walk through it helps you figure out
what you can do with your device a very
nice help center is kind of a text-only
version of that I am is a unified
instant messenger that lets you do yahoo
lets you do aim it lets you do msn
doesn't let you do google talk but we
have google talk for that so very nice
they're a little gratuitous plug for my
appt Joe the web guy available in the
market latitude does not come with the
other device need to just show the web
guy by the way let's golf too this is an
amazing game it's awesome I love it it
it only comes with a few levels out of
the out of the box wants you to buy the
full thing but the full thing is
gorgeous it's essentially a golfing game
very nice very well implemented as good
as the the desktop versions and then
some just all kinds of amazing the
market obviously it comes with and
that's where you get all of your stuff
from it comes right out of the box with
the new version of the market which I
don't really like but that's what we
have that's what it does messaging is
pretty much email it's your other
messaging the the email over here is for
corporate email whereas this is for
other stuff now most carriers are going
away from using that built in android
hotspot functionality with their own
essentially so they can charge you more
money and I don't necessarily blame them
for that although I do think it's
unfortunate here is verizon's and
essentially it just lets you turn on and
off your mobile hotspot manage your
devices and tell it when to turn off so
very very basic it does what it's
supposed to do but it is an extra charge
that you do have to sign up for and the
first time that you run that it's going
to walk you through the setup process to
add that service to your monthly account
moto print very cool you want to be able
to print from your device that's how you
do it the unfortunate thing is there are
not a lot of devices that are and when I
say devices I mean network or internet
connected devices that are on the
compatible list so if you want to be
able to print chances are you've got to
install a third-party app or in this
case the corresponding client app to put
it on a computer that has a printer
connected to it that is connected
to the internet so you can print through
that which means you have to download
install and maintain software on your
desktop computer your desktop computer
has to be on and it has to be connected
to the internet for it to work so the
utility right now is a little bit lower
than what I'd like it to be but very
very cool for thought and that's going
to pick up and become a lot more
important especially as you can use this
as a desktop computer with the right
accessories music is your music app my
accounts basically jumps you right into
the account screen that lets you go in
and add a Facebook and Twitter any
number of those accounts there's a whole
bunch of them that they support lots and
lots of cool stuff my verizon mobile is
your verizon account yeah lets you get
in and do tools and all kinds of cool
stuff navigation and Netflix all very
very explanatory not on the device to
begin with Netflix maybe but I installed
that almost right away so I don't know
if it actually came on the device or not
if not go out to the market and you can
download install it news is a simple
news aggregator I'll show you what the
widget to that looks like and it fell
mobile I think we all know what that is
Pandora places did not come on the
device a quick office did there is an
upgrade to this they do want you to pay
for it but I can still use it to view
all of my microsoft office and other
office formatted documents the phone
does come with slacker radio which is
really cool also comes with this social
location and social networking app which
just let you share your location and
your social network status with your
various different social networks
whether that's Facebook or Twitter or
any of the other so you saw in the
accounts I've installed sound how speed
tests and stop watching timer and
microsoft tag comes with task manager
tasks text messaging all of these V
castings and I didn't get into video
serve voice command which i think is
redundant with voice search does come
with voicemail and verizon navigator
which is Google Maps or ways but you
have to pay for it by use or by week or
by month all kinds of cool stuff and of
course we've got youtube and zumocast as
well zumo cast being a service by
motorola that again
you've got to have software running on
your desktop computer to be able to get
any utility out of it so that is pretty
much what comes with the the device here
the widgets that I was going to tell you
about will wrap up on those this is a
the ways widget up here we have your
gallery widget tap on that and you can
then open it up you can go into your
camera roll your library your friends
DLNA servers and whatnot very cool
looking very nice very fluid it looks
really good over here in landscape as
well changing the layout to fit better
on the screen so really really nice
there let's go back home I've got just
one or two more that I want to show you
the calendar here is scrollable now in
Android you usually in stock Android you
usually have to get a custom launcher
and you have to get a custom widget to
be able to do this this is built in way
to go Motorola it's beautiful it's great
i love it same thing over here with the
my data usage this is usually something
you have to get from the market and it's
usually not that accurate in this case
very good very nice very accurate here's
the news widget same interface that you
used to you can see all of your news
articles we go back here we've got our
social widget where you can see your
Twitter and Facebook feeds and set your
status as well very nice very fluid it's
just dumb only it's supposed to be done
it's beautiful one last widget to show
you is your favorite contacts widget and
here you can see I've got four of my
favorite contacts including my mom if I
drag down you can see a cool little
animation where it looks like it's
pulling the stack down and if I release
it it's going to pull up all of my
favorite contacts right there if I
reverse that it's going to put them all
back very nice very animated just to
show you how nice and quick and fluid
that is there you go you can also see in
here a carryover from the same subtle UI
tweaks with that the header bar and the
common used icon stuff so very very nice
overall Motorola you did a fabulous job
with the verizon droid bionic
now let's get to the bad news and will
end on that number one you can see my
battery right here battery life is going
to last you about half a day with
moderate to heavy use you're going to
want to make sure that you have this
thing plugged in when you wake up in the
morning plugged in as soon as you get in
the car if you're going to be doing GPS
plugged in when you're at work just
sitting there and keep this as full as
you can next recently we showed a little
video on pocket now about wall warts
wall warts being those things that you
plug into the wall to charge up your
devices and whatnot this comes with one
it does really good one of my
alternatives was to use a powered USB
hub to to kind of split that power out
amongst multiple devices and you can get
rid of all of those wall warts except
for the one for the USB hub this does
not charge over that and it took me days
to figure that out you know why was it
not charging it was maintaining but it
wasn't charging so I'd get up in the
morning and i had the same materie life
that i had the night before and it
didn't work had to go back to the wall
wart the USB power outlet that I showed
you in that video as well worked just
fine with fabulously well for it just
the other one does not so keep keep that
in mind if you're running into power
problems make sure you are using a wall
wart or a dedicated socket for it not
sharing it and be a lot happier next the
battery takes a long time to charge even
when plugged into its long board it can
charge in charge in charge in charge for
hours and hours and hours it's a 1700
plus milliamp battery so it's
understandable that's a huge amount to
to fill up with electricity but it takes
a long time don't expect just a quick
charge and you're done like on some of
the other devices this phone takes a lot
of juice it takes a while to charge it
up there is an inductive charging sleeve
that you can get they see if I can find
that in the accessories book really fast
right there they call it the wireless
charging battery cover so you can get
that and just set your phone down on a
charging pad sold separately and
it'll just charge up inductively that
might be your best solution get this
thing get a pad for work a pad for home
and just set it down on there so you
don't have to worry about it one other
thing the little powered USB port right
down there is upside down from every
other one that I've ever seen so when
you're plugging in make sure you have
that in the right orientation which is
kind of hard to do when you're coming
home and it's late and you don't want to
turn the lights on and yeah it's just
kind of difficult to get that
orientation right but keep that in mind
that other one by the way is my hdmi
port and I've just turned down Pandora
while we were here little matchbox 20
for us see how fluid that is I love it
love it love it so that's the next thing
now last and we'll talk about this a
little bit more that's your headphone
jack got it it's a headset more than
anything I still didn't get pandora off
how about that matchbox 20 there we go
now when listening to music through the
speaker the speaker is down here it's on
the back which is kind of a different
place from where they usually are up
here on the top that's fine but when you
kept it to amplify the speaker you got
to do the bottom of the phone at the top
of the phone little tip for you there
that sound is great I love it it's
wonderful as soon as you plug in a
headset to the top especially with
Netflix you're going to give hisses
you're going to get pop so you're going
to get a high-pitched whine and it's
something where you're not going to
think that it's the phone in fact I
thought it was the netflix tough i'm
going through the Star Trek Voyager
series right now and there were a lot of
hisses whines and pops that were driving
my wife and I nuts when we were
listening to this over over the ear bud
it's not the audio source it's actually
inside the device now I don't know
what's been done recently I've been
trying to get to the bottom of it and
that's kind of why this review has taken
a little bit longer to get out this is
not uncommon other people are getting
this as well it seems to be across the
board not limited to a specific set of
phones and hopefully there's going to be
some kind of an update that comes out to
it but we haven't found anything yet
having been said without having seen any
updated also the phone come through and
I've been checking they seem to be gone
away whether that means that I've just
got used to them or they're really gone
because of something else I don't know
but it's been quite a while since I've
noticed those pops in that high-pitched
whine the quieter electromagnetically
speaking your environment is the better
it seems that that is so that might be
indicative of a poorly shielded port or
connection back there on the back which
I hope not because that would be a
hardware problem rather than a firmware
software problem that could be fixed
with an update or a patch but like I
said in the last few days and it's only
been the last few days that I've been
using it that's gone away I haven't
noticed it or it's just not there at all
so make sure you head over to
pocketnow.com to see the full review of
this wonderful awesome device I am going
to be so sad to send this back to
verizon even though i'm not really a
verizon guy i'm not really a motorola
guy this is by far the most awesome
phone i have ever had the opportunity to
use and even with the battery even with
the the slowness to charge even with
those audio pups and whatnot you are not
going to be disappointed at all if you
go out and grab this as your preferred
device I know I wasn't it's an amazing
device and if I were on verizon this
would be the phone that I would be
carrying around on a daily basis so that
is the really extended software review
showing off not only benchmarks for
speed but also the processor as well the
built-in apps as well as some of the
others that we've done and a few little
caveats that we've caught in our testing

video we've got a write-up about the
device that's coming to pocketnow.com
