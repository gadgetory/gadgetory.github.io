pocket now calm the HTC One X has been
HTC's flagship Android phone for much of
2012 but not to be outdone by Samsung
and all the other OEMs coming out with
faster and faster phones they introduced
the One x+ which claims to be 67% faster
than the 1x which is a good thing
because in a lot of cases the One X can
be laggy so does the One x+ fix
everything that's wrong with the HTC One
X in this video we're going to do a
comparison okay so we're going to do a
variety of speed tests to see if the One
x+ is significantly faster than the One
X HTC claims it's 67% faster thanks to
the inclusion of a second-generation
Tegra 3 chip is video clocking in at 1.7
gigahertz it's a quad-core chip versus
the first-generation Tegra 3
it's a quad-core chip also clocking in
at 1.5 gigahertz to make do with all
that extra power the One x+ has a bigger
battery 2100 milliamp hours compared to
1800 milliamp hours on the original One
X and in terms of design they're very
very similar we've got red buttons here
on the bottom of the One x+ and we've
got white buttons on the One X flipping
over to the back we've got polycarbonate
on the One X and soft touch plastic
which actually feels a lot nicer on the
One X +1 explose is actually a little
bit heavier than the One X because of
that bigger battery back here we've got
a really cool looking red ring around
the camera we've got no red ring here
we've got Beats Audio logos down here
and Flast aesthetic difference so the
front-facing camera looks a little bit
bigger here on the One x+ because it
takes pictures at a higher resolution
now the front-facing camera camera uses
the dedicated image sense chip so that
should provide better front-facing
camera performance now I should mention
that if you want a One x+ of your own
you can stop by club coat UK right now
they're selling these for about $600
unlocked you can bring it to the US
using on AT&amp;amp;T use it on t-mobile or any
other carrier that uses the GSM standard
so the first test that
you're going to run here is boot up test
let's see which of these devices turns
on first so tapping and holding the
power buttons and release 1x plus is
already a little bit faster which is
good like to see the 1x plus being
faster it should be faster 1x plus 1 by
about 2 seconds here and we've got both
of these devices set up very similarly
and again they're running different
versions of Android we've got a jelly
bean here and Ice Cream Sandwich here
which is good because that's how they
come and a few things I want to point
out right now both of these are on
automatic screen brightness going into
the settings screens they launch at the
exact same time the color temperature is
different between the One x+ and the One
X as you can see let's zoom in on the
screen and maybe you can see this the
One x+ actually has a cooler screen
temperature meaning as a bluish tint to
it whereas the One X has sort of a
warmer color temperature which gives it
kind of an orangey glow it's very subtle
but there's definitely a difference
between the two screens which is
something interesting so let's go back
to the home screen here let's flip
around see if we can perceive any
difference here the 1 X was always a
little bit laggy when opening folders
when adding widgets to the home screen
so actually let's tap and hold and see
if we can sense any difference so we're
going to drag this over here drag that
over there okay one click select and not
much of a difference that we can tell
there let's look at opening a folder so
here's a folder in a folder definitely
faster on the One x+ let's do that again
a little bit faster on the One x+ I
haven't messed with screen animations
they're both doing it the exact same
time let's launch the camera one two
three go interestingly faster on the One
X we'll do that again okay a little bit
faster on the One x+
let's switch to the front-facing camera
and you're going to see a pretty big
difference a little bit software
differences here because of the slightly
updated version of sense camera here is
main forefront and
it's going to be hard to tell on camera
here but looking at it from my point of
view I can definitely tell you that the
camera the front-facing camera on the
One x+ looks better so that's good if
you do a lot of video chat okay so let's
go into the web browser which is
interestingly called browser on the 1x
plus an Internet on the One X that's
strange one two three go
okay that was about the same time and
here we are on pocket now and let's move
around on the page and see see how if
there's a difference we're both on the
same Wi-Fi network here so in a click
pocket now should be seeing the One x+
going faster and yes it's off to a
faster start the One X isn't too far
behind and watching for the progress bar
here and the One x+ finished first we'll
wait for the One X to finish we're just
going to stop it here let's zoom in see
which clears up text more quickly a
little bit choppy on the 1x definitely
and release a little clearer it actually
cleared up faster on the 1x well look at
that that's not good that that's one of
the reasons we'd problem to the
performance on the One X because it does
it did stuff like this it had these
white spots but here all the One x+
looks like they think maybe not I guess
they didn't fix that so let's zoom into
another story you know both of these
devices I hate to say it are still have
a little bit of lag to them alright
let's see how they do with loading this
next page and here they come and okay
the One x+ finish first we're going to
double tap the zoom in as soon as it's
done on the One X and I don't want to
wait for that long so it's stopping
double tap okay faster on the One X plus
text always looks really good on the
screen it's just a matter of not having
the lag now let's go to the verge which
has a lot of images on the site you'll
notice the keyboards are a little bit
different we don't have this bottom row
here on the One x+ which is good because
that really took up a lot of space and
that's just a software thing not a
hardware thing so
The Verge alright we're just going to go
to right here the verge comm slash
gaming when x+ is getting there a lot
faster and well that was interesting the
1x just kind of came in at the last
minute there so here we are let's check
screen rotation speed faster on the 1x
that was interesting
faster on the 1x + kind of a back and
forth here so let's zoom in and see how
long it takes for text to clear up if I
can get at the right time and release
okay that was about even there
again getting all this white space here
on the 1x let's go into this story right
here and the 1x plus finish first so
generally speaking the 1x plus is
definitely faster in web browsing but it
still has a little bit of that lag issue
which i think is attributed to the Tegra
3 which never was that amazing of a CPU
especially when coupled with heavy
software like sense it's another story
if you're running CyanogenMod 10 but
obviously we are running still sense
here next test we're going to let's
launch YouTube at the same time one two
three go interestingly a little bit
faster on the 1x ok we'll go back let's
see which loads that looks interesting
let's see which renders the video first
faster save that for later
much faster on the 1x plus let's go back
to another video and see if the
experience is the same ok let's check
this out got some ads here ad loaded
faster on the 1x plus okay so again it's
faster another thing we want to check
out here is the speed at which the
multitask UI opens of course we have
dedicated multitask button here one two
three go exactly the same time there now
we're in a load shadow gun which is a
relatively big high FPS game so one two
three go
faster off the bat here with the one
x+ let's put them into landscape faster
a little nx+ live out a second press
play at the same time good music right
alright let's see which loads faster
that's annoying
ok one ex-boss is definitely loading the
stuff faster here let's see if there's
any difference in framerate loaded
faster here on the 1x + spring one act X
out we'll just move around a little bit
and see if you notice any difference
it's going to be subtle let's look at
some bright spot in the sky that's a
lens flare there alright some fire smoke
looks pretty good
bring out the 1 X 2 left here good exact
same thing yeah there's really no
difference here between these two games
floating time is definitely faster but
there's smoke looks about the same
that's where the cinnamon table
basis in so that was look at the
differences between the One x+ and the
One X as we've seen in test after test
the One x+ is a little bit faster than
the One X but really not by much if you
have a 1 X you shouldn't feel compelled
to update it wait for HTC's 2013
high-end phone or get a Galaxy s3 or
something else but do not upgrade to the
One x+ you have a 1 X it's pretty much a
same phone just a little bit faster with
better battery life of course if you're
in the market for a phone the One x+ is
a great place to start it's got the
latest version of Android right out of
the box if you like sense this phone
will work well for you if you don't like
sense then of course you could probably
route it and put your own customer arm
on it but again thanks to our friends at
club coat UK for letting us take a look
at the One x+ so we could compare it for
you here on video and see how much
faster it is than the One X if you liked
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching
that's it for now
