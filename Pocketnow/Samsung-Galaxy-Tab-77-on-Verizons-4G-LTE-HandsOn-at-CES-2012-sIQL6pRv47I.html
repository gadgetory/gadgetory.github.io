from pocketnow.com n again we've got
Brian here who's gonna shows off the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 which honestly is
a lot better than I thought talk about
it oh yeah as you can see super thin
device that thing is thin you know the
problem with these 7-inch tablets is
there always thicker to be able to
accommodate the battery and everything
but this thing is just incredibly slim
and it looks quite sturdy can you try to
yet it looks thick I mean it looks
strong it looks sturdy but yet again it
looks very sleek now talk about the
specs yeah absolutely so we've got a 1.4
dual processor we've got a super amoled
touchscreen so the screen resolution on
this is unbelievable great clarity great
color 7.7 inch screen as I said fuel
core processor running Android Honeycomb
32 okay and there's a bunch of great
Samsung applications out of included
here so one of the things we have is
media so you can actually get access to
TV shows and movies and the cool thing
is if you have a compatible
to be or blu-ray player you can watch
the same movies here that you can watch
on those device okay okay that's awesome
cool feature it also has
an application called the daily so this
is a new also the daily it came to
android metal so it's interesting coming
out on this device and so it's really a
Richard media experience so in addition
to reading an article you had that video
have embedded audio and because it's
running off the 4g LTE network super
fast you know what is this an IPS
display er I mean it looks amazing it's
umm yes super amoled plus display so it
looks ok super amoled plus yep ok
interesting it's just the colors really
pop it's and this is a cool one I don't
know if I can demo right now it's called
Smart Remote goes what you can do is you
can program all of your TV remotes
stereo came all that in one place in one
place there's a guy down here it
integrates with your cable or your FiOS
provider ok if your guide changing
channels you can edit all of that right
to your devices ir blaster go ok that's
what i was going to ask you we've got
the IR blaster here got the power button
we forgot you volume let me see what
kind of camera is that sure what megapix
i gotta check the specs on the ok we'll
check eventually we got a flash there
must be good you got your sim card slot
ok key card slot ok so we've got 4g LTE
on this device to that you got ok very
very nice game demo before which is
awesome let's try it that space did it
again go ahead they were playing it
right now and it was just it was just
playing very very well
see if we can preview with here what
processor what processor does this run
as I said it's a dual-core processor I
don't have the exact must be the Samsung
Exynos but I believe that that was the
selling point for this tablet but while
the graphics just looked amazing you
know honestly if you're looking for a
variant for the ipad but don't want all
the bulk of a 7-inch tablet Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 is probably going to be
your choice it's a very very sleek
design that just looks really elegant
that's probably what I like the most
about it it just stands out and it fits
in your pocket which is what's the most
important I love the brush metal at the
bottom very very nice site well I'm a
big fan thank you very much again Brian
I really appreciate your help with
everything that's coming from verizon
LTE really good launch is coming up so
stay tuned for even more hands-on videos
