tablets compare to one another I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 versus a Sony
Xperia tablet Z Samsung is largely the
dominant force in the Android tablet
sector in q1 this year it was the only
Android tablet manufacturer to hold
double-digit worldwide market share with
just under half of Apple's 39.6% share
the rest of the market is divided
between smaller Android manufacturers
and a handful of om building Windows
tablets Sony for example isn't even
listed individually almost tablet market
share reports and that might make you
think Sony's latest tablet would
struggle to keep up with a more widely
known tablet brand like the Galaxy Tab
10.1 but this head-to-head battle may
surprise you aside from the fact that
these two tablets are the same general
shape they actually have very little in
common and while both are quite similar
to their smaller siblings the Galaxy Tab
3 being much like the Galaxy s4 in the
Xperia tablet Z being similar to the
Xperia Z this comparison is not quite
that simple
you can tell without ever picking up or
touching either of these tablets that
what they have to offer is very
different the tablet Z from Sony uses
with quality its design and build
quality are practically identical to the
Xperia Z which we were quite fond of
during our short time with the handset
except on a much larger scale the front
is almost entirely composed of a 10.1
inch display and the edges are coated
with a matte finish plastic the inner
portion of the edges is filled with a
shiny metallic plastic and the expansive
mostly blank backside is also covered
with the soft touch plastic ultimately
aside from how minimal the tablet is
what you will first notice about the
Xperia tablet Z is how amarka Bleeth in
the tablet is it's an impressive six
point nine millimeters thick if you're
fond of samsung's design and use of
hyper light plastics you will likely
have no issues with a Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
at least on the outside it's
unmistakably related to the galaxy s4 it
utilizes the same exact design a
textured hyper glazed finish the top of
lightweight polycarbonate body faux
brushed metal trim along the edges and
bold Samsung logos plastered on the
front and back and it uses Samsung's
typical custom navigation button layout
with a physical home button centered at
the very bottom of the face flanked by
menu and back capacitive buttons to the
left and right respectively
for the record both tablets feel sturdy
neither twist or squeak with a firm grip
but the tablet Z's certainly has a major
advantage on its size not only does it
sport a matte soft touch finish which
makes it easy to grip with one hand and
feel much more premium it ships with IP
57 certifications for dust proofing and
water resistance by no means is the
Xperia tablet Z a ruggedized tablet but
that's not the point
if you want to take the tablet to the
beach or lake or if you want to use it
in the kitchen you can without the fear
of ruining it that's certainly more than
can be said for the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
the unfortunate side effect of dust
proofing and water resistance rating is
that each of the ports on the tablet Z
are covered but hats off to Sony for
squeezing the package down into a
surprisingly thin device and doing so in
a manner where the ports are still
easily accessible without being a huge
burden apart you might take the Tab 3
10.1 and Xperia tablet Z is similarly
sized devices however there's a rather
significant difference in the footprint
of these 2 tablets at 266 millimeters
why the tablet Z is 22.9 millimeters
wider than that Tab 3 10.1 but the tab 3
is 4.1 millimeters taller and 1.1
millimeters thicker however both hit the
scales at roughly the same mark 495
grams and 510 grams for the tablet Z and
the Tab 3 10.1 respectively
specifications are also quite different
the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 features a 1.6
gigahertz dual-core Intel Atom chipset 1
gigabyte of RAM either 16 or 32
gigabytes of built-in storage a micro SD
card slot 3.1 megapixel rear camera 1.3
megapixel front facing shooter 6800
milliamp hour battery and as the name
alleges a 10.1 inch TFT display which
offers a Meeker resolution of 1280 by
800 pixels Sony's tablet at least on
paper is better equipped for a power
user
it comes with a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of built-in
storage with a micro SD card slot for
expansion 8.1 megapixel rear facing
camera 2 point 2 megapixel front camera
6000 million power battery in a 10.1
inch 1920 by 1200 pixel resolution LCD
display with Sony's Mobile BRAVIA Engine
2 while we're on the topic of displays
it goes without saying the Xperia tablet
Z has the superior panel yes the Galaxy
Tab 3 10-point ones TFT displays an
advantage in contrast flags on the
tablet
here washed out engrave at the tap
threes contrast unlike other Samsung
devices fitted with AMOLED displays
isn't much better what the tablet is he
lacks in contrast however it more than
makes up for it in color reproduction
saturation and clarity the Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 gives colors a much needed
boost seriously don't turn it off and
the 1920 by 1200 pixel resolution stomps
all over the 1280 by 800 pixels on the
tab 3 10.1 it's honestly a shame on
Samsung's part considering the Nexus 10
has one of the highest resolution
displays on a tablet ever 2560 by 1600
pixels hands-down the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
is no match for the Xperia tablet Z and
hardware which includes specifications
design form build quality and display if
we switch to the software side of things
it's a much more evenly matched fight
don't get us wrong though samsung
dropped the ball once again if you power
on the two tablets at the same time you
might initially find yourself
gravitating towards the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 it runs TouchWiz like any other
galaxy tablet and is equipped with the
latest version of Android version 4.2.2
the interface on the Xperia tablet Z
however might leave you scratching your
head initially it looks like it's
running Ice Cream Sandwich it features
the leftward navigation buttons and the
notification panel in the lower right
corner swiping down from the top of the
display does well nothing but tapping on
the top right corner will open the app
drawer
navigate to the about page in the
settings however and you might feel a
little more confused that's right
it's running Android 4.1.2 not Ice Cream
Sandwich and honestly we couldn't be
more happy about this strange fusion of
ice cream sandwich tablet interface atop
jelly bean it puts the controls within
reach of your thumbs when you're holding
the tablet two-handed and it just makes
more sense than implementing a phone UI
on a 10-inch tablet and that brings us
back to TouchWiz on the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 basically it's a good version of
TouchWiz which overrides some of the
Android 4.2.2 features and it's missing
the most important and useful features
of TouchWiz like multi window features
that would be perfectly useful on a
tablet such as pop-up browser are
nowhere to be found only the touch woods
features we don't really care about
smart stay and smart rotation are
available it's almost as if Samsung
dug up this TouchWiz UI from a few years
ago and slapped it on slightly newer
hardware with an Intel chip the
notification shade for
Apple resembles applications that are
not yet optimized for tablet use it's
full screen and it utilizes the 10 inch
screen rather poorly
it's just rough around the edges for
instance within the notification shade
is a button in the top right corner
which is supposed to reveal a page of
settings toggles however there are no
additional toggles only the ones that
appear above the notifications in the
standard configuration pressing the
button only makes the brightness slider
and notifications disappear that said
Sony's software isn't perfect it's
heavily-laden which is to blame for some
stuttering throughout use more on that
in a bit the interesting bit is that the
Galaxy Tab 3 software
unlike most other Galaxy devices does
not offer you tiles of software features
in this case the Xperia tablet Z takes a
cake where the Galaxy Tab 3 is missing
the multi window feature the tablet Z
offers what Sony calls small apps which
are free-floating applications
accessible by a button in the action bar
almost every part of the software
experience on the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
fills half as 'red naturally the tablet
Z pulls even further ahead as if you
hadn't already guessed this theme
continues into performance to be fair
neither tablet performs flawlessly both
tend to stutter and lag from time to
time on both accounts we can blame that
on heavily customised interfaces but the
Xperia tablet Z has doubled the memory
meaning it can jump between applications
markedly better than the Tab 3 10.1
without having to completely reload each
application synthetic benchmarks also
put these two on a level playing field
in terms of performance the sound coming
from the speakers on either one of these
tablets is plenty loud for multimedia
consumption unless you're in a noisy
area in that case you'd probably be
better off with headphones anyway they
got likely to have three 10.1 speakers
however are fairly easy to completely
cover with the palms of your hands the
Xperia tablet Z speakers are also quite
easy to cover but not entirely since
there is one speaker on the bottom of
each the left and right edges and two on
the bottom edge on paper the Galaxy Tab
3 10.1 has the larger battery but only
by 800 million Powers in day-to-day
usage the two tablets appear to drain at
approximately the same pace both also
have software features that attempt to
prolong battery life but what it boils
down to is if you use either tablet
heavily you'll have to charge it every
day if instead you use them more
sparingly they will likely last several
days on a single
just remember to switch off Wi-Fi when
you're not using it to keep them going
longer the camera performance on these
two tablets is night and day though
neither particularly awesome it's a case
of mediocre camera and purely terrible
the 8.1 megapixel camera on the tablet
see is no stunner but it's fairly
comparable with smartphone flagship from
in the last two years
pictures lack detail and proper contrast
but as camera gets the job done and the
software has ample features the Galaxy
Tab 3 10-point ones 3.1 megapixel camera
is just there it takes pictures which
lack necessary detail they're noisy
fuzzy and often out-of-focus you would
think a tablet third generation or less
coming from the market leader in Android
tablets the creator of a tablet is
fantastic as the Nexus 10 would be
capable of completely burying the
competition but in just a few months
time it seems as if Samsung forgot how
awesome the Nexus 10 is and instead went
back to its old ways Sony the unlikely
winner takes this battle in a decisive
manner its Xperia tablet Z is a tablet
you won't be afraid to take around water
or dirt which offers a decent camera
useful software a high-resolution
display crammed into a svelte
high-quality casing the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 has none of that
there's just not much else to say the
Xperia tablet Z is the definite
undisputed winner in the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 is a 2011 esque mid-range tablet
and the Intel Atom chipset simply isn't
enough to save face that's going to do
