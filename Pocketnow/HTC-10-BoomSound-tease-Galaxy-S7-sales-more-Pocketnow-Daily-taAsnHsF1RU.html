for samsung so far retail availability
of the iphone SE hasn't really helped
the company sell more make CC continues
to sell bloom sound for the device we
cannot wait to see I'm hi Mary vera and
you know what's worse than mondays
you're right there's nothing worse this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with Samsung those of you
wondering exactly how many galaxy s
seven units have sold and I was already
providing details apparently the company
has sold up to 9.5 million units in
three weeks which is a lot more than the
seven million units that the company was
expecting obviously more than the galaxy
s6 as well it's clear that the company
has hit it out of the park with the
Galaxy s7 edge our reviews have been
very positive so far we can't wait to
see how this evolves going forward with
the vices like the g5 and everything
else that's coming later this year and
speaking of Samsung we have been
covering foldable Samsung this place for
a while we are expecting the company to
bring something for 2017 and according
to some trusted sources apparently there
are two devices in the works a 7-inch
tablet and a 5-inch smartphone and these
could be ready for early 2017 and this
is rather interesting we saw the whole
patents it seems that we are getting
clamshell devices and I can't wait to
see that 7 inch tablet that's actually a
very unique tablet that I would like to
see personally for those of you that
have been following the controversy of
the LG g5 the micronized coating which
was a called plastic by somebody on
YouTube recently well the companies can
honk just came on record and explained
the whole process of micronized this is
pretty much like applying a coat of
paint to metal it doesn't mean that the
phone isn't metal just like a car is
metallic and it has paint over it and
this coat of paint is what allows the
company to cover the antenna lines that
we so hate so far reviews of the LG g5
have been very positive expect our full
review to come very soon and for those
of you that are wondering exactly how
much of a dent is being made by the
iphone s ii apparently some trusted
analytics already claiming that barely
point 1
% of the iphone install base which is
really bad the only device that had ever
performed worse was the iphone 6 plus
last year and that eventually ended up
picking up but it seems that Apple isn't
really selling a crazy amount of smaller
iPhones you know what it makes sense I
mean hey it's not like if the phone is
that cheap either and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
HTC 10 the company continues to tease
things like boomsound speakers on this
phone we've seen many leaks from trusted
tooltips trev leaks that don't show us
that there is boomsound on this phone
and this is also not the first time that
HTC a leak certain things and eventually
we get something else it could be that
we are getting this the company has
teased it twice now they claim they're
obsessive with sound but it leads me to
the question of today how important our
smartphone speakers for you do you
constantly either watch videos or play
games or is it really something that's
elemental to you in my case I do like it
I do prefer it but I wonder exactly why
it's taken so much for companies to
adopt at HCC came up with it and we see
a few Nexus devices out there that
support it and some Motorola's but then
everybody else just doesn't care it
makes us believe that it's not really
that important leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

want to get these loose earlier before
