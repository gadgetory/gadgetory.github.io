information with our friends and our
families over social networks very very
easily my favorite social network is
Twitter it's short sweet and to the
point but their app is terrible I'm Joe
Levi for pocket now and here are some
alternatives to the Twitter app for
Android the first app that we need to
mention is Twitter's official app no
it's not an alternative but it is the
app by which all the others have they
have to be measured by now one thing
that we really liked about this app when
it got its recent facelift not this
facelift but the one before that was the
attention to detail on the fonts and
just the way everything looked nice and
smooth and pretty and then they went and
did this and it's some kind of
collection of we we don't know what it's
smooth don't get me wrong it functions
well but it's a hodgepodge it's it's not
Android it who knows what this is it's
it's a twitter app there's got to be
something better and in fact that's why
there is such a great amount of other
apps out there that run basically the
twitter api perform a lot better than
even the stock app does next up is an
app called tweetcaster now this is
available free but you can get the pro
version which essentially just removes
this ad that runs down at the bottom for
the sake of simplicity I've got that
they're just so you can see it now again
very fluid app this is it's fast it
scrolls through a lot of content very
quickly has some really nice ways to let
you know where it's cutting off the
previous from the newer tweets that
you've got in there swipe over to get
mentions direct messages favorites and
then something that not a lot of the
other apps have is the ability to go
right into your lists and find out stuff
that that you like right there that
pocket now crew for example is a list
that I've got set up so you can see some
of the tweets from the pocket now guys
over the
over the years so very nice it's
relatively responsive you've got all
these options that you can use not a lot
of gesture support in here but it's just
a very basic very simple way to go in
and get your tweets in a way that looks
a little bit nicer a little bit more
organized though a little cartoony
compared to the official twitter app
next up is an app called HootSuite now
this is something that is really great
on the desktop but for some reason I
couldn't get this to work on my mobile
device had it working before change the
password and now it won't let me login
it says that my passwords invalid even
after I've gone in and reset my password
I've got to give it lower marks for that
because it should just work one would
imagine that it does but you do have to
have this HootSuite login a HootSuite
account to be able to make it work
that's where a lot of the aggregation
comes in in fact it's aggregating both
Twitter and Facebook data as well and
really is a good tool for professionals
though i recommend the desktop version
not the app itself another aggregator of
sorts is seesmic cute little raccoon
looking guy there and again paid by ads
unless you go professional with the
upgrading to the professional version
this is a little bit older of a nap you
notice it doesn't have the hamburger
menu it doesn't have some of the other
stuff it's got the more button down to
the bottom not quite keeping up with
times but still very very nice very
fluid in this case I've only got it set
up to look at my twitter account not my
facebook account as well but that's just
personal preference getting in here a
little bit different way of looking at
photos and some of the others that were
a lot larger this one you have to go
into the the tweet itself to be able to
see that photo but that means it's a
little bit cleaner and hey Casper tech
has met his first Fitbit goal for the
year so thumbs up for Taylor Martin
there good job man we've told you about
this app before and it's just been
continuously getting better it's called
plume it used to be called Twitter
spelled in a very French way
but this is a very fast very fluid app
with lots of settings that you can come
in make changes to you can customize the
look and feel use the system font use
the stock font that comes with the app
you can do all kinds of fun stuff
reverse the order so it's oldest to
newest instead of newest to oldest you
can change the highlighting the stripes
different colors for different users all
kinds of cool things along with setting
the the theme that you want if you just
want to run everything all together hide
avatars lots of stuff that you can do to
make this app feel like you you can
customize it have it do whatever you
want you've got all of your all of your
stock stuff that you'd expect you can
write your tweets in here very quick
very easily you can even come through
here and reply to your direct messages
which some other apps don't let you do
or don't let you do very well I've
picked a really really ugly theme here
and I apologize for that but hey the
good news is I can just come in here too
to customize this and I can change that
to make it look a little bit better
however I want in fact this one looks a
lot more Twitter like then then that
last one is but you can do lots of fun
stuff the app here is called plume it is
available in a free version and also an
unlocking key that you can get from the
app store it goes on sale all the time
so your price may vary one of the apps
that we really liked a lot the last one
that i want to show you here is carbon
specifically carbon two is what they're
calling it now this app has been around
for a while but it just got a major
facelift as you can tell it's lik it's
smooth it's fast it's probably the
smoothest one out there but very very
minimalistic in fact if you want to see
some other cool stuff this has got some
gestures so if we do a two finger pull
it kind of tips out of the way so that
we can do a refresh we can do the same
thing I've met my limit on refresh is
there I can come back in and do some
other things with two finger gestures do
a real quick tweet right there by
clicking
on that or tapping on that icon nothing
over here to the side but over here is
where I've got my favorites swipe over
swipe over again so very quick way to go
from just your timeline to your mentions
and then all the way over to your your
direct messages very very minimalistic
it even hides your navigation buttons it
doesn't quite use the KitKat immersive
feature which would be kind of cool if
it did but it it blacks everything else
out so that all you're seeing is what
you want to see and that's your timeline
in a very slim very fast very elegant
way it's really easy to read and if
you've got a what is it an OLED panel
you're also going to get some really
really nice battery efficiency because
this is all nice and black thanks for
