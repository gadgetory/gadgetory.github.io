Tony behind the camera we're at the
Samsung unpacked event looking at the
galaxy s5 which we expected to be much
different than what we actually have
here but since it is what it is let's
compare it to what it's trying to aim at
both devices could not be more different
than each other the galaxy s5 is
sporting a 1080p 5.1 inch a super amoled
display with a 1080p resolution where in
the case of the iphone 5s we've got the
typical retina display and you can see
this I mean this is huge the galaxy s5
is just huge in comparison to the iPhone
5s even though this is the biggest
iPhone ever the galaxy s5 is also you
could say nestin as the iphone 5s though
obviously it's hard to tell though
obviously this is plastic we've got this
faux no longer leather but sort of
texturing plastic at the background the
case of the iphone 5s you obviously have
aluminum and glass and when it comes to
everything else i mean think about it
this phone is clocking not a 64-bit
processors we were expecting it's a
snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.5
gigahertz where in the case of the
iphone 5s we do have an a7 64-bit chip
but think about this there is not enough
RAM to actually take advantage of the
64-bit chip in the case of the iphone 5s
so regardless we could say that we have
on par devices here then and everything
else we've got for example a 16
megapixel camera on this galaxy s5 that
is not optically stabilized and in the
case of the iphone 5s we have the
typical 8 megapixel camera that is not
optically stabilized as well now one of
the major differences with this galaxy
s5 is the fact that it's water-resistant
now keep in mind this is not waterproof
just water resistant but hey it's great
it's water and dustproof and it's rated
in the case of the iphone 5s bear with
me here don't get this phone wet because
it will get ruined and aside from that
you also have this heart rate monitor
that you do not have in the iphone 5s
and we probably will see it in the
future we just don't know Tenzin's
implementation is the best obviously we
have to test it
laughs first other than that there is
one big deal that is similar to these
phones and it's the fact that they have
fingerprint scanning and even though
Apple does it with touch ID on this
button at the bottom in the case of the
galaxy s5 it's actually a swipe towards
the home button and if it could get it
right let's see if it gets it right this
time and swipe to the entire pad and
forget it it didn't get it right so
let's use our proprietary password here
see if notice iphone 5s unluck immediate
galaxy s5 let's try one more time no
match no match no match something's
wrong but anyways you get the point it's
really hard to get this right it's
probably a software glitch we were
trying it earlier and it actually did
get it right a couple of times but other
than that we've got samsung's new
TouchWiz UI we're expecting new cards
and the whole UI that we saw at CES and
no this is pretty much almost the same
TouchWiz that we know we'd get this sort
of like magazine UI that it's already
seen on the Galaxy Note 3 but then when
we head back it's pretty much the same
pains the same UI with different cards
then we go into the app tray it's pretty
much the same UI only with different
aspects and then when we go into
settings we do see that it actually
looks a little bit like iOS for example
if I go to Twitter you'll notice at the
top of iOS is covered by the full bar
and we get that same sort of aspect than
you I and the galaxy s5 go into settings
we get this new UI which is a little bit
different in the case of the iphone 5s
if i could find settings is obviously
this is the typical iOS 7 the UI that
we're already used to samson wants to do
with icons Apple keeps doing it the same
way they've been doing it for seven
years so the question is which phone is
right for you that's a very interesting
question will obviously have the galaxy
s5 for review their pocket our labs very
soon so far these are dramatically
different phones samsung is trying to do
something better with this phone we have
the m7 coprocessor for fitness on the
iphone 5s that is yet to be proven
useful the galaxy s5 is trying to do it
differently along with the gear so we're
definitely going to test these things
and tell you which one is better Anton
behind the camera hi Mary better with
pocketnow.com at mwc sweating like crazy
but we'll be back with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
