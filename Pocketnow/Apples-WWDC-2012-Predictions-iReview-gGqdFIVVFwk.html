pretty much a certainty
we've got images of an iPad Mini
probably coming up and will we be
getting a new generation iPhone next
week all this and more coming up right
now I know I know it's been a while
we've been doing a lot of changes behind
the scenes you've seen our new review
style our new videos coming from Michael
Fischer from Tony and from Brandon and
let's just say I've been very busy with
the post-production of these videos to
bring you the same standard quality and
everything that we do and well it's time
to go back to our roots hello everyone
its High Marietta from PocketNow and
welcome to our I review the show we go
through all this week school and the not
so cool inside the world of Apple's iOS
devices I've been wanting to say that
for a while but this time it's gonna be
a little different because well there's
not really much to talk about this week
everything is gonna happen
as of a couple of hours with WWDC 2012
so let's go through our top 5
predictions of what we expect Apple to
bring to the table with their new
releases or probable non releases number
5 is not even a rumor anymore it's
pretty much a certainty iOS 6 is gonna
be released at WWDC we've seen the
posters out there already the biggest
question now is what are we getting
facebook integration is coming uh
nothing really big there it's pretty
much just a button but apparently Siri
is gonna lose its iPhone for us
exclusivity and now it's gonna be
supported by the iPad the question is
which iPads are gonna be on that list
the iPad 2 should be on the list
considering that it's got pretty much
the same hardware that we could see in
the iPhone 4s but Apple is always Apple
and apparently we are going to be
getting that Do Not Disturb button for
notifications finally let's hope they
also include a kill-all button for the
multitasking applications if you could
call that multitasking but apparently
there could be some good things coming
with iOS 6 Apple wouldn't be changing
the number of it wasn't big but they've
been really quiet about everything that
will happen most likely we will be
getting a beta and then we'll probably
get a launch somewhere early you know
the fall are probably later within the
summer but not really sure it's gonna be
launching in June let's see what happens
with that one and ios6 pretty much leads
us to number four on our list
turn-by-turn navigation apparently
Apple's bringing a new map service that
they call their own obviously they're
hiring somebody to do it for them but
apparently Google is not gonna be the
back engine anymore google recently
already had an event where they're
showing their new application with 3d
mapping coming to the iPhone though not
really sure how that's gonna be
integrated with the iPhone or if it's
gonna be something that's coming from
the Google Earth application that we
already know but apparently Apple's
gonna bring something the question is is
it gonna be just 3d maps or turn-by-turn
navigation we're hoping that Apple
finally gets the memo because that's one
of the only reasons why a lot of us
people are sticking to Android because
we get free turn-by-turn and it's really
really good so let's see if Apple gets
the memo like I said earlier and bring
something new to the table there
hopefully something different number
three has to do with two different
things
first of all is iCloud it's turning one
year old and what will be customers are
losing their exclusive services like for
example galleries and file storage as of
the 30th of June so what could happen to
iCloud first of all there's been rumors
of some social streaming happening to
Photo Stream after they figured out how
to allow us to delete everything somehow
and then after that well apparently
they're working on a new synchronization
service for video earlier of the filming
of video just like on Photo Stream and
it'll appear on your Mac afterwards for
editing not sure if that's gonna happen
but that leads us to the other thing
that's probably gonna happen what's
gonna happen to the Apple TV it has
nothing to do with what we cover it's
pocket now but it's the number one
accessory for the iPad with airplay and
everything apparently there are rumors
that applications are now gonna be
working on the Apple TV at least some of
them have these Angry Birds but imagine
the opportunity of not only being able
to stream things as opposed to also
mirroring things to the Apple TV but
also playing certain games through the
cloud through iCloud with all the apps
that
you purchase on your iOS device and
since have the Apple TV pretty much uses
iOS also let's see what they'll do with
these two services as of WWDC they ever
do anything with them number two can you
believe it and I've had many apples been
so reluctant to change their form factor
a lot of us were beginning to lose hope
but it seems that the Kindle Fire has
made it then in their market share even
those turning out to be a little bit of
a dud
but apparently Apple is working on a
prototype at least to try it and it
looks really really credible it's got
everything that we'd expect on an iPad
Mini and it kind of looks really good
let's just hope that Apple brings
something different with his iPad Mini
if they ever do launch it I think apples
not really out to bring a smaller
version of the iPad I think that they're
I booked haven't really taken off as
they'd expect and apparently this iPad
Mini could bring that sort of hybrid
display that we heard a couple of months
ago where it apparently it had eating
and also was an LCD sort of a hybrid not
sure if the technology is there yet but
I think they're mostly focused on
bringing an e-reader not necessarily
just a tablet or a computer replacement
but time will tell and the top number
one prediction for WWDC 2012 is none
other than a new iPhone call it the
iPhone 5 or whatever you want to call it
Apple really needs to make changes and
we do believe that they will feel the
pressure remember what happened with the
first generation iPad they saw the
competition bring their tablets and
immediately they launched it at the iPad
2 we do believe that Apple's seeing the
competition coming from the HTC One X
and also the Samsung Galaxy s3 we
already saw the mock-ups of some real
new hardware for the iPhone bringing a
new unibody design that uses one part
instead of the backing that currently
breaks a lot with the glass on glass
apparently they are using some sort of
new metal with this design not sure what
Apple will bring to the table all we
know is that the competition is getting
so fierce that if Apple doesn't act
right now they're gonna have a lot of
people wearing Samsung and wearing HTC
by the end of the year so hopefully they
will be seeing that pressure and I hope
I'm right I'm
I know a lot of people are saying that
this is not gonna happen the rest of the
editors in pocket now don't believe it's
gonna happen but trust me I do wish I'm
right but again next week siren you is
gonna be talking about what we liked and
what we didn't like about WWDC so
hopefully the likes included new iPhones
we'll see that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high memory betta again thank you very
much for your support and comments
asking for these shows to come back they
are back and again don't forget to give
us a thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
