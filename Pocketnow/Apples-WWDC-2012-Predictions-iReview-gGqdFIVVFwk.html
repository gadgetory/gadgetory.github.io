pretty much a certainty we've got images
of an ipad mini probably coming up and
will we be getting a new generation
iphone next week all this and more
coming up right now I know I know it's
been a while we've been doing a lot of
changes behind the scenes you've seen
our new review style our new videos
coming from michael fisher from tony and
from brandon and let's just say I've
been very busy with the post production
of these videos to bring you the same
standard quality and everything that we
do and well it's time to go back to our
roots hello everyone its high marietta
from pocketnow and welcome to our Ivor
view the show we go through all this
week school and the not-so-cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices I've
been wanting to say that for a while but
this time is going to be a little
different because well there's not
really much to talk about this week
everything is going to happen as of a
couple of hours with WWDC 2012 so let's
go through our top 5 predictions of what
we expect apple to bring to the table
with their new releases or probable non
releases number 5 is not even a rumor
anymore it's pretty much a certainty iOS
6 is going to be released at WWDC we've
seen the posters out there already the
biggest question now is what are we
getting Facebook integration is coming
duh nothing really big there it's pretty
much just a button but apparently
Syria's going to lose its iPhone for us
exclusivity and now it's going to be
supported by the iPad the question is
which iPads are going to be on that list
the ipad 2 should be on the list
considering that it's got pretty much
the same hardware that we can see in the
iphone 4s but apples always apple and
apparently we are going to be getting
that do not disturb button for
notifications finally let's hope they
also include a kill all button for the
multitasking applications if you could
call that multitasking but apparently
there could be some good things coming
with iOS 6 apple wouldn't be changing
the number of it wasn't big but they've
been really quiet about everything that
will happen most likely we will be
getting a beta and then we'll probably
get a launch
somewhere early you know the fall are
probably later within the summer but not
really sure it's going to be launching
and June let's see what happens with
that one and iOS 6 pretty much leads us
to number four on our list turn-by-turn
navigation apparently Apple's bringing a
new map service that they call their own
obviously they're hiring somebody to do
it for them but apparently google is not
going to be the back engine anymore
google recently already had an event
where they're showing their new
application with 3d mapping coming to
the iphone though not really sure how
that's going to be integrated with the
iphone or if it's going to be something
that's coming from the google earth
application that we already know but
apparently apple's going to bring
something the question is is it going to
be just 3d maps or turn-by-turn
navigation we're hoping that Apple
finally gets the memo because that's one
of the only reasons why a lot of us
people are sticking to Android because
we get free turn-by-turn and it's really
really good so let's see if Apple gets
the memo like i said earlier and bring
something new to the table there
hopefully something different number
three has to do with two different
things first of all is iCloud it's
turning one year old and mobileme
customers are losing their exclusive
services like for example galleries and
file storage as of the 30th of June so
what could happen to iCloud first of all
there's been rumors of some social
streaming happening to photostream after
they figured out how to allow us to
delete everything somehow and then after
that well apparently they're working on
a new synchronization service for video
where your be filming a video just like
on photo scream and it will appear on
your Mac afterwards for editing I'm sure
that's going to happen but that leads us
to the other thing that's probably going
to happen what's going to happen to the
apple TV it has nothing to do with what
we cover at pocket now but it's the
number one accessory for the ipad with
airplay and everything apparently there
are rumors that applications are now
going to be working on the Apple TV at
least some of them have these angry
birds but imagine the opportunity of not
only being able to stream things as
opposed to also mirroring things to the
apple TV but also playing certain games
through the cloud through iCloud with
all the apps that you purchase on your
iOS device and since AB the Apple TV
pretty much uses Iowa's also they see
what they'll do with these two services
as of WWDC they ever do anything with
them number two can you believe it and
I've had many apples been so reluctant
to change their form factor a lot of us
were beginning to lose hope but it seems
that the Kindle Fire has made it them in
their market share even those turning
out to be a little bit of a dud but
apparently Apple is working on a
prototype at least to try it and it
looks really really credible it's got
everything that we'd expect on an ipad
mini and it kind of looks really good
let's just hope that Apple bring
something different with his ipad mini
if they ever do launch it I think apples
not really out to bring a smaller
version of the ipad I think that there I
books haven't really taken off as they'd
expect and apparently this iPad Mini
could bring that sort of hybrid display
that we heard a couple of months ago
where it apparently it had eating and
also was an LCD sort of a hybrid not
sure if the technology is there yet but
I think they're mostly focused on
bringing an e-reader not necessarily
just a tablet or a computer replacement
but time will tell and the top number
one prediction for WWDC 2012 is none
other than a new iphone call it the
iphone 5 or whatever you want to call it
ample really needs to make changes and
we do believe that they will feel the
pressure remember what happened with the
first-generation ipad they saw the
competition bring their tablets and
immediately they launched it at the ipad
2 we do believe that apple's seeing the
competition coming from the HTC One X
and also the samsung galaxy s3 we
already saw the mock-ups of some real
new hardware for the iPhone bringing a
new unibody design that uses one part
instead of the backing that currently
breaks a lot with the glass on glass
apparently they are using some sort of
new metal with this design not sure what
Apple will bring to the table all we
know is that the competition is getting
so fierce that if apple doesn't act
right now they're going to have a lot of
people wearing Samsung and wearing HCC
by the end of the year so hopefully they
will be
seeing that pressure and i hope i'm
right i mean i know a lot of people are
saying that this is not going to happen
the rest of the editors in pocket now
don't believe it's going to happen but
trust me i do wish i'm right but again
next week sigh review is going to be
talking about what we like then what we
didn't like about WWDC so hopefully the
likes included new iphones we'll see
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching on high memory
better again thank you very much for
your support and comments asking for
these shows to come back they are back
and again don't forget to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
