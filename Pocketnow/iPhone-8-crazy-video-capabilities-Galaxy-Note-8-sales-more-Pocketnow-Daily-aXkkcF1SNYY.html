of the iPhone eight cameras will be able
to do Samsung's Galaxy no data set to be
ready for primetime close to its
announcements and photos of the HTC made
smaller pixel to have just emerged I'm
hai never leave a tab back at the old
studio and yeah I am enjoying the fact
that it's Friday
this is parking out daily the official
news today I have to do with the product
that we are essentially still waiting
for that'sa yeah we still don't have any
dates on the essential phone what we do
know is that it's currently available on
Best Buy for notification to users who
subscribe meaning cassettes coming soon
it's currently going to be available and
it's unlocked and sprint variants so the
fact that it's in a retail partner kind
of makes it a little more credible that
we should wait for it we'll see and how
about if we discuss huawei ads and what
the devices that we're waiting for this
year is the May 10 being the May 9 one
of our favorite phones last year this
turns out the company has just the
patented or trademark the name entire
view display so yeah we've got the full
vision display on the g6 we've got the
infinity display on the galaxy s 8 so it
seems that the entire display is going
to be the name that always going to be
using can't wait to see what this phone
is like and for those of you that are
wondering exactly how different is the
pixel 2 to the pixel XL - well Evan
blast has just leaked a couple of images
of the smaller variant apparently it's
being made by HTC as we expected LG
making larger one those of you wanting
the two by one aspect ratio it's
apparently not going to make it to the
smaller smartphone or to a larger one so
yeah let's see what benefits we get here
with a smaller pixel I'm still a big fan
of the current pixel up to the point
where I'm still using it even with
today's technology so I can't wait and
set your calendars there are some
trusted sources claiming that the Galaxy
Note 8 will be available for sale at
least in Korea on September 15 meaning
that it could just take a couple of
weeks after that for it to reach the
rest of the countries the biggest
problem is that we know that the event
for this phone is August 23rd we're
talking pretty much a full month after
it that could be really close to iPhone
8 territory even though the iPhone 8 at
least the more innovative device is
rarely not slated until November let's
see how Samsung is going to
play ball here maybe the company knows
someone we don't and finally the hottest
rumors today have to do with the iPhone
8 and more home pod firmware leaks as
apparently this particular smartphone is
going to be capable of recording 4k
video at 60 frames per second on both
cameras and this is actually a first in
many things first of all currently it
doesn't really matter what phone you get
the selfie shooter is never capable of
doing the same thing that the primary
camera can do when it comes to video
recording the second is I don't know if
you've noticed but only a handful of
professional cameras can record 4k at 60
frames per second so seems that Apple
might up the ante when it comes to video
recording capabilities and that's all
great but it leads me to the question
today do you care about this in any way
is that a deal-breaker for you to have
this amazing capability for video
recording on your smartphone because in
my case to be honest with you I don't
ever use 60 frames per second at all
like seriously either for reviews or for
the daily I don't there was a comment
down below we'd love to know your usage
scenario in opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
