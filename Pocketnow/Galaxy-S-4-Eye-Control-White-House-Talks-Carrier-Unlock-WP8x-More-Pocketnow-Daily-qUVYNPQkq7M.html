and locks finally some additional leaks
of the galaxy s 4 and Microsoft's job
posting hits 21 next Windows Phone OS
I'm hi Mary vetta and I'm caffeine fee
for the last three hours this is poking
out daily the White House has just sent
out a clear message that's a great job
at starting our week let's legalize
carrier unlocks after the petition was
signed a couple of weeks ago and then
the FCC chairman confirm last week that
it was important to have a look at it
well how the White House s confronted
they'll figure out a way to make it
legal obviously we can't confirm as
that'll take a couple of weeks a couple
of days it could happen in a couple of
months probably a year but what's
important is that obviously the battle
has begun and the White House is at our
side we'll see now let's talk about
microsoft and windows phone numbers have
the company working on three different
upgrades to Windows Phone coming soon
but two of these are actually just minor
upgrades the last one is actually
Windows Phone blue which is the code
name for the next version of the
operating system though we don't know if
that's going to be 8.5 8.1 or whatever
now the first one of these minor
upgrades is going to happen in may
according to some leaks but other new
rumors on a job posting state that the
final version which is code name blue
will happen in the fall or the holiday
season and just for the record I mean it
happens every year it's just great to
see that Microsoft is not announcing
something now for is any launch by the
end of the year we'll keep you posted
hey now let's talk about Samsung those
of you who join me in liking the Galaxy
Note 8 that we saw at mwc 2013 well we
only saw it in white of the trade show
but the interesting news is that new
leaks have a black version coming out
soon of the Galaxy Note 8 but we
obviously need the white one to come out
first but point B is that apparently
this comes in that color and not really
the shiny white that we saw at mwc so
it's interesting to see what Samsung
brings to the table but obviously we'll
keep you folks that we have no dates
just yet for either one of these
versions at least not specific and for
those of you who thought that by passing
the lock screen only happened on iOS
devices well think again new reports
prove that it's also happening on
Samsung Galaxy devices all Samsung
Galaxy devices and it apparently all you
have to do is go
to the emergency dialer and after a
couple of tweaks you'll figure out a way
to get into the device without obviously
punching in the lock code and accessing
certain aspects of the device at least
for a limited time it's hard to know
when Samsung will fix this because we do
know that upgrades to the galaxy lineup
in most cases depend on carrier so just
stay tuned and for now don't lend your
phones to anybody and finally for the
interesting news of the day can you
believe we finally have some galaxy s4
leaks believe it or not this company is
that a fabulous job at keeping their
device a secret but now we do have some
reports that the company has been
working on a new I controlling
technology that will allow you to scroll
with your eyes yeah you can currently
use smart stay to leave the display on
but we kind of wonder what you're going
to do by controlling your device with
your eyes aside from getting a headache
but that leads to the question of the
day aside from eye scrolling what else
would you do with I controlling software
or what else would you like for samsung
to bring to the next Galaxy s4 with your
eyes in my particular case as with a lot
of things in the galaxy lineup a lot of
them are gimmicks but leave us a comment
down below what would you want of course
if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone inside the world make sure
you follow us on parking out comment
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm high never be
better thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
