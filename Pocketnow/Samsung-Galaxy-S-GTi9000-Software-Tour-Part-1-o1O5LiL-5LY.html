Daniel Webster here for Pacquiao comm
and this is a software tour of the
Samsung Galaxy S five thousand so the
first thing you'll notice is we have
these different live wallpapers and I
can change them by just holding and
selecting on the screen and go to
wallpaper and just select live
wallpapers and we have a few other
options on this device we have Aurora
blue C and dandelion so if I select one
of these this one is kind of like
jellyfish swimming in the ocean so I can
set this wallpaper and now the jellyfish
shirt is swimming around this scene so
now I can go to applications and we have
an e books program on this device that
comes with the samsung galaxy s so we
can just go here and it comes with a
couple books if I select on Sherlock
Holmes it will start back on to where
the last page I was reading and all I
have to do is quickly select either
attack to the right or type to the left
so you go to the next page or I can also
flip it so you just go back home go to
the next application and the coolest
application on this device is probably
the all-share application which allows
you to play video files or media from
either your computer or your server or
play from another computer via your
phone so we can go on to play file from
server and I have a few others here I
can select from my ready DLNA on my
network and just go to my videos go to
all videos and I have lots of videos on
my server that downloaded and that I've
transferred from DVDs so I can go cancel
of course we have a calculator which
also has trigonometric functions and
logarithmic functions so we can just go
back
I have my calendar application which
allows me to add my own tasks and my
agenda so I can either switch to a
different month or a different year if I
like change the week day and list
feature and go back I had the camera
which works pretty well but of course I
don't have any photos or anything I'm
gonna take a picture right now so it
also records up to 720p a video file I
have the clock which I can select many
different alarms I can change it to
world clock stopwatch and also set a
timer so you can just go back so I have
my daily briefing which is my TouchWiz
and this shows me all my weather if I
scroll over I get I get stock
information scroll over again I'll get
latest news and if I have anything under
my schedule I can see all my schedule
events right here email of course and we
also have an FM radio and you will need
your headset connected to use the
antenna on the FM radio so I can just go
back Gallery which is just the generic
Android Gallery on this device and I can
look at all my photos and go back again
Gmail and Internet which is the Android
of default browser but they call it
internet on this device we have later
you can download layer to any device on
the Android Market and what it allows
you to do is when you're out and about
in a city or whatnot you can just take
your device move it over and uses the
digital compass inside and you can get
certain information about buildings or
businesses or whatnot like right there
when you're looking at it so that's
pretty cool we can go back we have the
maps program market and a memo so in
this program we can just quickly type a
memo to ourselves save if we want but
I'm just going to cancel so a lot of
people have been saying that the
TouchWiz UI is not that great on other
devices but this device it's actually
very well put together
and I have seven different pages that I
can load applications or widgets if I'd
like so I can just click on select and
go to Android widgets let's say that I
wanted to add oh I don't know any one of
these I can also go to Samsung Apps but
I'll show you that in the next video and
go to dual clock here
and it just adds a widget onto the page
you can scroll back to home or we can
also hit the home button to go back to
the very first page so this is a
software tour of the Samsung Galaxy S
and this is part 1 of 2 so stay tuned
for the next feature in which you show
more applications on the samsung galaxy
s thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
