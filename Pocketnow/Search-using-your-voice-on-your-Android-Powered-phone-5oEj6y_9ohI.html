I've got a little tip for you that a lot
of my friends who have android phones
don't seem to know about so I figure you
might be somebody who doesn't know this
trick either so let's get right into it
this is going to be using the Android
built-in voice search functionality
we're going to start out with the google
nexus one that i have unlocked and put
cyanogenmod rom on but this should work
with any android device out there
anything that has search functionality
built in which they all do so one of the
nice things about this phone is this
little search icon right here little
button on the home screen if you don't
have that button that's not a problem
let me show you what you can do go to a
blank part of the screen and let's add a
widget and the widget that we're going
to add is all the way down here at the
bottom and not all the way at the bottom
it's just simply called search tap that
and you get a google search box just
what you need it does the same thing as
this little search icon so go ahead tap
that type anything in the quick search
or we want to go back home tap that type
something into the quick search but
today what I really want to show you is
how cool this is to search using your
voice as with all voice recognition it's
important to speak clearly and slowly to
enunciate what you're searching for and
to realize that you may come up with
some undesired results shall we say
sometimes even comical but let's go
ahead and give it a try it's almost nine
o'clock here in the evening let's say
I'm kind of hungry and I'd like some
pizza so let's see what we got tap that
and let's click on this microphone icon
pizza in Syracuse utah now it's going to
go through and parse that text and throw
it into search box and what does it come
up with pizza and Syracuse Utah that's
100% it's great
this is done a google search and here my
local results for pizza in syracuse utah
I've got Papa John's I've got pizza Rita
pizza factory Santa Monica pizza if I
want one of these top three results I
can tap to bring up my dialer and column
right away or I can tap and show them on
a map you can see they're just up the
road from me I'm just down over here so
that works out great if I wanted to I
could navigate to that or I can go to
the next result further down the road
next result let's say I want to go to
Papa John's I can get driving directions
i'm going to use maps and we're going to
go ahead and navigate to that and it
says if i want to go get pizza from them
right now this is what i need to do
piece of cake i can hop in my car go and
get pizza just fabulous but let's say
I'm not in the mood for pizza let's say
we want to do indian food indian food
syracuse utah not going to do anything
because I didn't have a microphone
indian food syracuse utah let it crunch
on that for a little bit and it comes up
with Indian food Syracuse Utah that's
two for two that's really amazing of
course I'm in a quiet environment which
helps but still the level of recognition
the accuracy is just amazing you've got
taste of india which has five stars it's
my favorite indian place around here if
you ever get out to you thi you've got
to give them a try we can call them show
them on the map we can even tap in here
and get a little bit more information
from the google local feedback so that's
really nice you can see 100 percents
across the board so if you don't know
whats around and you want to just see
what you can do go ahead and just voice
search for it come up with all kinds of
reviews dress codes what kind of parking
is available all of this is just right
there available
your fingertips using the the built-in
search that comes with all android
devices and a connection to the internet
so really really nice last thing that
I'd like to show you is a different kind
of search so let's let's go back to the
home page and we'll start over here
let's say I want to search for northern
Kings they're a group have good music
there a cover band if you haven't heard
of them go ahead and look them up let's
search for mon on my device see what
comes up hopefully this is going to show
you what's on the device as well as some
web results but we'll see northern kings
so right there it skipped my local
search and it's just on a web search
which is really just fine for me you've
got all this stuff myspace results
you've got a Wikipedia entry you've even
got some image results and video results
don't stop believin we we have to watch
a few seconds of that tap on it it opens
up the YouTube app loads the video start
streaming it and right there just using
our voice and picking a couple things
out here we've got immediate access to a
song in this case or where we want to go
for dinner or what kind of indian food
is available so there's a little tip
that hardly any of my friends knew about
if you haven't used the built in android
search specifically the voice search I
would really recommend that you give it
a try I'm interested to learn how it
works on your device so please in the
comments if you'd like give us a video
show us how search works on your android
device if you don't want to do a video
that's ok go ahead and leave a comment
tell us what device you have how often
use search if it does well for you and
if you use the voice recognition feature
and how accurate it is as well we're
really interested to hear back from you
so for pocketnow.com i'm joe levi
showing you the built-in search
functionalities of android devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
