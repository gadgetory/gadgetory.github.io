space this week as Apple can't make
enough iPhones to meet demand while
blackberry can't keep its head above
water long enough to sell existing stock
microsoft announces its second round of
surface products while it soon to be
acquired hardware maker Nokia prepares
its own windows tablet probably and the
horrible horrible marriage of HTC and
beets finally mercifully dissolves all
that plus iOS 7 making people vomit in
the 90 minutes ahead on episode 06 3 of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
audio podcast from pocket now where we
discuss smartphones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined by concert car and some time
phone enthusiasts senior editor Taylor
Martin good morning to you paddock and
by the American half of pocket now is 24
hour news team the man who'd still carry
a StarTAC if he could Steven shank hey
man oh boy how you doing no no no too
bad as i was telling Steven just off the
air right before the show started he is
uh he's had a hell of a Newsweek this
week so we're looking forward to hearing
a rehash of the week's events straight
from the horse's mouth at least half of
the horse's mouth and Honda know gia has
a birthday coming up and is is off is
going to have a day off soon so if the
site doesn't fall apart we'll still be
here next week just to make an
announcement before we start the show
from our Twitter fans yes pocketnow
reader Jeff kabuli against all odds we
did start recording the show on time and
listeners we regret to inform you that
we will need to skip listener mail today
because why Taylor Martin uh I forgot
you know why it's the same answer is
mine and you and I are in the same boat
today cuz we're too busy we're too busy
for you people right but that's that's
the general answer right right we're
each doing he has a lot of the
comparisons in the pipeline yeah
there you go yeah what are you comparing
today I am comparing iOS 7 with Windows
Phone 8 oh you're doing another OS
comparison that's a sequel to the iOS
versus Android comparison you know which
went live on the site just a few hours
ago excellent so that's up it's not in
the rundown because you should watch the
video if you want to see how those
platforms compare I think we're gonna be
tearing Michael I'm going to be
comparing this my note to one of my
favorite devices of all time with this
monster beast that doesn't resemble it
at all sitting next to me the note 3 so
that's going to be interesting it's
amazing guys how a millimeter or two can
change and devices feel in the hand
because this thing feels so much bigger
than the note 2 I really yeah and I
don't know how I feel about that and
somehow it's smaller i know but i think
it's dimensionally i think its wider
like comparatively speaking it's is it
smaller in every dimension yeah it can
there's no total I remember saying that
a teef I remember saying something like
that idea and I'm like now I must have
been high and drunk because this thing
is it Samsung still avoiding metal
because it's working on these
Lovecraftian four dimensional plastics
that file size and design but yeah well
that's what that's what I assume okay it
is narrower x over 1 millimeter it's
narrower in the in the beam dimension
like I mean left to right as you're
looking at the device yes that's its
color frigging possible the beam gets
possible yeah like you know i like
talking about ships sometimes I call the
phones the phones casing the hull which
is a community board of a starboard edge
USB port down at the keel is ranked by
hours standby button on the sundeck go
ahead Taylor so it's 150 one point two
millimeters tall and the note 2 is 150
1.1 so it's point 1 millimeters taller
and image is it's but it's a millimeter
narrower it's 79.2 millimeters wide in
the note 2 was 80.5 so its 1.3 million
our idea what Samsung is it has done
here to defy physics or maybe maybe I
should just get out of the business and
ghost
farm or something because this thing an
idio awkward compared to the note 2 and
it's a millimeter thinner too so it's
not as thick I know a center yeah yes
dinner it's never get confused the note
2 and node 3 it's lighter I think maybe
because it's less rounded that
definitely plays a partner they mean
this thing looks like it exploded galaxy
s2 it's that scary because the the
xperia z ultra wasn't it wasn't just
that it was so big the fact that it was
like a textbook completely square in
every dimension was was made it feel a
lot bigger yeah well let's we're going
to get into the note 3 in a bit and
we'll we'll pick up this thread again
right now I want to talk about the the
news the more recent news of the of the
day kicking off maybe one of our last
podcasts probably one of our last
podcasts with the blackberry topic this
depresses me because I was thinking
about this as I was putting the show
together listeners if you haven't caught
up on the news blackberry has been sold
or is agreed to be sold to a capital
firm called Fairfax what is it fair
financial holdings fairfax financial for
4.7 billion dollars which and and it
will it is currently winding down its
relationship with its hardware maker or
at least that's what that's what the
hardware maker said what was the name of
that maker that's not on the links here
do you guys remember who makes
blackberries hardware that starts with
that j yeah anyway we'll look at on yes
but at unix / buying all the phones e
this is um yeah there's just just news
all over the freakin all over the
internet about blackberries I hope you
said this depressed you yeah this
depressed me I cried when I made that
video yeah so we really have jbeil
circuit incorporated here there you go
thank you how do you pronounce it jbeil
yes Jha a PIL circuit incorporated yes
oh well wait a minute hmm but is that
that's trading under the this
ok I've got confused because I've got
that JBL powerup doc and I was like this
is JBL does Jamie well it trails under
car symbol yeah all right anyway sorry
we are already derailed I apologize but
the point is that blackberry is not in a
good state right now and the reason I
was sad about it Taylor I want you to
talk about in a second but we only
established the blackberry category at
pocket now no less than a year ago prior
to January we didn't really cover
blackberry at all I mean there was like
the occasional random video from two or
three years ago was like the storm or
whatever but we didn't have a particular
coverage plan for it and after my visit
to Toronto to see the z10 unveil I was
like oh we should have a blackberry
category so that's then it started owner
it was nice and has this like purple
color and that's cool and unfortunately
it looks like there's not going to be
much to report on because we don't cover
enterprise stuff which is all blackberry
looks to be doing and once this
investment closes right yep last week on
the podcast actually right before
blackberry announced the big news I said
blackberry should pull out of the
consumer market and focus on enterprise
and four hours after the podcast that's
what they announced so right isn't this
exactly that remember that leeched plan
from last year Google wanted to buy the
company yeah then they had this idea of
you know going all out with the
enterprise stuff even meet up going
android is like just an activist
investor that was that was proposing
that or who was proposing that yeah yeah
cast out it was it was an investor okay
yes he was basically saying gather yeah
he was basically saying blackberry
should kind of pull an IBM all right so
it would still make some hardware the
news yeah and you're right Taylor we did
start with the bad news last week but
the new news the new bad news is that
the company has taken some really really
rough hits in the financials it's
written down almost a billion dollars
worth of unsold z10 hardware which man
that's fed though that is a very big
over estimate place are we now going to
call that the only a service is that
going to be the terms yeah
it's basically that right and also
somebody on Twitter was saying like can
somebody say z10 to fire sale and I
haven't heard the term fire sale bandied
about in a little while and it reminds
me of the the pre three and touchpad
stuff the uh yeah yeah it was an EPA I
got it I got a touchpad it was a riginal
II almost think of 650 and I got it 420
books yeah I know what you mean i got my
much 6 50 but then i went back to best
buy two weeks later and they were
actually doing after the after sale
refunds but the point is i think we are
going to see and meanwhile t-mobile USA
is taking blackberry off it's keeping
them on the shelves in the retail stores
but it's no longer stocking them i think
if i read that release properly so i
don't know what sense that makes but
okay however well David Simon no one
walks into the store and just buy stuff
these are business people buying them
they get set up through you know some
account they're okay they're all order
have them at the retail store for people
to try out but if they want to order a
note I don't think they're going to even
have them in the store p rio david
barron said this weeks ago maybe mate it
was old news but he said that t-mobile
is stopping blackberry cells several
weeks ago okay so that's what he said on
twitter at least so yes that's the
TmoNews guy there's a 930 four million
dollars of unsold z tens and there's a
what is a nine dollar share agreement
but what was the their total revenue is
also down significantly and i was
looking for that revenue fell 45%
according to Reuters to 1.6 billion from
a year earlier the other guy think we
saw has been these the 4500 firings that
were rumored last week finally confirmed
I just think it's funny some of these
blackberry enthusiast sites are trying
to paint this as possibly good news
because there's some headline that was
going around for Apple back in like
1997-98 where it's no Apple has to trim
the fat to move forward and they were
you know just likes like very firing
thousands of people and sure Apple's
turn itself around remarkably since then
but if they think that same things gonna
happen to blackberry either they know
something we don't know or just a little
diluted I don't know well that's one of
the hazards of being an enthusiast site
right
too I love enthusiast sites you know we
are distinct from them in that we are
not based around a platform or a family
of platforms but I used to hang around
the webos nation forms a lot night
absolutely loved it over there but it
the same thing what happened like
horrible news would get released and
people really know this is good there's
a precedent for this remember how
Commodore turned itself around yeah no
no i don't but uh the the biggest news
are not really news but i guess the
biggest surprise looking back was how
much blackberry has dropped because you
know we say that they've dropped but you
don't really get that effect you don't
get the full feeling because the company
was just so massive before many of us
really got into the industry um because
they were the top US smartphone market
share holder for several years yeah tom
and then we're duking it out for a while
yeah okay they were enormous and they
were second worldwide by a wide margin
over iOS even in 2008 2007 the company
was valued at over a hundred billion
dollars Wow hundred billion dollars and
they're getting purchased or there's a
deal uh somebody throws in a bet for 4.7
billion well that is behind numbing and
it's not that the companies only worked
four point seven billion now if it
didn't have patents it would go for much
less right now the patents alone or
valued at almost five million dollars
there's a so yeah I want to mention
there's an autumn idea I mean five
billion I'm sorry those yeah I loved I
sometimes look like looking into the
recent past to see who was right about
things because uh we should mention all
things D was totally right about this
back in july twenty third when they
reported it basically asking the
question why is fairfax financial buying
up so many steaks of blackberry in
blackberry rather and this as i as i
said this was back in july it had just
completed a bunch of purchases it had
doubled at stake from five point twelve
percent to ten percent back in july and
I love the double-talk that comes out of
the company here though they when all
things D is asking them or whoever the
interviewer was is asking them about the
purchase they're saying we've never seen
a technology company with assets and
talent of this caliber come down as
cheap as the stock of this one has
there's a worldwide following
significant capital tremendous talent
and the singular focus on innovation
which you know we're talking about
BlackBerry's so LOL is it one of the
Fairfax people that weren't they on the
blackberry board I think so yeah I heard
something about that they had to step
down prior to these deals going with
Reuben oh maybe they were trying to
write get the company to pick up stock
when it was she perfects I was rims
fourth largest shareholder okay and then
they became the largest one before
submitting a bid to buy them but a point
taken says all things D and I love this
club still a cynic might look at watsa's
decision to double down on remand wonder
if he's not positioning Fairfax to make
a quick buck on a potential takeover of
the company and of course Fairfax denied
that when any company gets this cheap it
could be taken over but we believe this
is a great canadian company with a
tremendous future mmm well we'll see
more more power to him or them and uh
good luck yeah so I mean it's been a
downward spiral for five years it's not
to say it can't turn around but it's
it's pretty bleak yeah and I think that
go ahead the patent portfolio is
actually two to three billion dollars so
the company itself is really only for
1.7 that's the bid for the company
roughly I mean if you take this at face
value so i'm holding a cute n right now
and I'm struck by how much I still
really like this device and somebody on
Twitter recommended that a bunch of us
fire up some old blackberries and start
using them for a while which I thought
was a pretty cool idea I would use the
8330 if it wasn't Alto well and that's
uh that's what I was going to ask you
about so I love this cute n I want to
I'm gonna propose a piece on the on the
q10 a little later because this
blackberry news is not going to stop
unfortunately though it's morbid and
it's really sad obviously this
blackberry juice is going to keep
pouring out until eventually it stops
and
we're gonna keep covering it so I'm
gonna do a piece like you tender yeah
Taylor Martin had a nice little
throwback piece his first i believe is
not right it is yeah it took me forever
it's so long yeah when Taylor first
submitted his script to me Stephen it
was like 17 pages long and look at the
life history of him hey that wasn't a
very emotional piece for me I started in
this industry with running a blackberry
website so that's right I yeah I ran on
phone dogs blackberry site which was
bberry dog and that was the managing
editor for a little while and then I
started writing about everything because
I realized that it was not so this is
like a losing a child almost to you yeah
yeah yeah the littlest is that is this
Taylor's webos moment yeah I guess well
back in two thousand eight I realized
that blackberry was in a bad spot back
in so I jumped ship on the blackberry
site and said I'm done here and started
writing about everything so I saw this I
didn't see you know it's not to say I
predicted the future but I saw that it
was a downward trend and jumped so so
you did that you did the 8330 throw back
though and did it bring back some nice
memories for you have you been oh yeah
all my old apps and games and themes
that I built everything was for a
breaker yeah friend visiting meteor
crush her that game I played it so much
in high school like just sitting in
class yeah paying attention I was
sitting in a coffee shop the other night
and there was a couple i assume on a
first date nearby and for some reason as
you know all good first dates do the
conversation got around to smartphones
at one point these people they could not
remember if BlackBerry's even had apps
in the first place oh yeah that was a
big I remember blackberry blackberry app
world was released in what 2009 april
first 2009 a joke and I remember like
like three months later one of my
friends who had to had a blackberry
curve 33 8330 actually was like yeah how
do I get how do I get this this app on
on here and I don't know what it was
like some kind of instant messaging at
it was like oh you just go to a
blackberry app world she's like what
what
I look at her curve and she doesn't even
have blackberry app world installed and
yeah wasn't this total mind I couldn't
get it because one it was on alltel into
it it doesn't have Wi-Fi so it was just
kind of right I couldn't do anything
with it yeah well anyway listeners you
should check out that 8330 throwback
it's a cool video I enjoyed going down
that on that track down memory lane with
you Taylor I hope that you found some
you know hope that you found some
closure at least in the process of
making it yeah and I enjoyed it it did
it brought back a bunch of fond fond
memories of when blackberry was in a
much better place yeah well if you want
to share your own nostalgic feelings
about multicolored track balls and you
know battery poles come on over to that
video there but I think we should turn
the corner and talk about the other side
of the mobile industry the one that is
enjoying a lot of success right now iOS
and has been enjoying quite a lot of
success for a while our iphone 5s review
is coming very shortly Brandon minimum
is working on that I think that's going
to go up today but the iphone 5c review
is already up and if you would like to
let me know how much of an apple fanboy
am for scoring at higher than the LG g2
please go right ahead and hopped on down
to the comments of that review get such
a fanboy thanks i went to the apple
store yesterday to get my um to get my
case my ex back cover that's what a
fanboy would do and you know it go right
the apple store and difficult right I'm
just such a jerk and I so is there any
reason I've gotta run there is there any
reason you have hung on the back of your
phone hon because you're able tomore fan
little be the big hey you like are you
are you using a German slur at me hun
the case on the back of the iphone 5
seat a little rounding out that just
shows a Jay King fun of it oh I didn't
know that they were saying Who am L
signed that they were saying whoever
designed that Steve Jobs would have
fired immediately yeah you know that's
it's funny because I can't complain
about that all I want to do all day is
go on Twitter and Lissa cost the people
who insist on using that boring old
argument that Steve Jobs would be
rolling
his grave like I bet there are four
hundred and forty thousand instances of
that one phrase on the internet just
from this month like it's really really
annoying and somebody else pop down and
beat me to it was like I just want to
remind everyone that during Steve Jobs
tenure at Apple we got the piece of
software that is itunes and i think this
is a total train wreck of p of softwares
yes it is sold on itunes so i love it i
love how it's just a sport yes yes it's
matt sick that's that's just the image
that's not the actual install just image
but it no like I'm just sitting here
typing and doing that thing and then
itunes pops up no I did not open you
itunes go away so I closed it out and
then I'm typing typing typing and it
pops up again and ask me for my passport
no stop go away like I hate it so much
well itunes us like your mother living
in the apartment below you yeah with a
broom handle on it boom boom boom boom
turn that down yes or a desire yeah okay
so I've interrupted you know I don't
hate itunes nearly as much as I as I
like the iphone 5c that sentence doesn't
make any sense but the point is i like
the iphone 5c a bit more than I thought
and you know what's funny I've been
having this conversation about about the
5 c's place in the market and stuff like
that and you know really ultimately is
it an iphone 5 in a plastic case yeah
with very few exceptions but even even
so that fact does not diminish the does
not detract from the additional fact
that it is an outstanding smartphone
that has aged way better than almost any
Android device range Android device I
can't imagine taking a droid incredible
4G LTE from last year and putting it in
a different case and expend experiencing
the kind of responsiveness that I do on
the iphone 5c I mean having the gall to
sell it as a brand new phone and not
completely look like an idiot and doing
that oh yeah I don't know and I called
him out for that in the review to it was
like listen this doesn't even put it as
a con it was like this doesn't justify a
new model number but that being said
it's um it's a really really solid
experience that phone delivers
especially the new
software which I just adore I would
never carry it personally and I wrote an
editorial to that effect because it's
not for me but man they're going to sell
so many of them the 5c what I'm trying
to say before is not selling nearly as
quickly as the 5s which we're going to
get to in a second but the 5c is uh is
available everywhere and I was talking
to the apple rep at the store when I was
getting my case was like so another
thought you don't have any 5 s's but is
the 5c like moving and she's like yeah
I've seen I've seen some people around
here with them and you know people come
in they ask for the 5s and then they we
don't have them and some of them will
buy the 5c I sold like a dozen yesterday
like wow what's yeah hi I would like a
new car instead I'm gonna buy this used
car because I don't have any more new
box well if the huge color comes and it
comes in different colors and you know
if you're just salivating to buy
something I've totally done that I've
gone to the store like when I was a kid
I used to go to the store and if they
didn't have like the Star Trek toy I
wanted but they had another one even if
I already owned the toy I just when I
needed to go home with something so
there's a strange buying behavior at
work but the 5s shortage is very real
isn't that Steven so they say I mean it
took I think minutes of the phone going
up for order last week before they are
pushing back a launch date to october i
think it's still october at least it was
as a yesterday but it's got to be
pushing towards the end of them look at
this point which is expert oh it was
just a goal at first now it's worth all
the colors and you know this happens
with every apple launched and a lot of
commenters have written words to that
effect like yes they always sell out and
that's always a big buzz worthy moment
for them so they can leverage that look
at you know look at this amazing demand
but when i was in the apple store
yesterday i was playing with a 5s and i
was using the fingerprint scanner demo
which very intelligently on every screen
it says your fingerprint will not be
saved so you're not afraid to play with
it and i hope it's true because i use
that thing about 45 times and it was
really really cool but is the
fingerprint sensor the reason for these
delays or is it a contributing factor
because we reported on that I think like
a week ago that the finger they couldn't
make the fingerprint sensor fast enough
whatever supplier is providing this to
Apple so do we know if that's if that's
the the the crunch factor here that's
part of it but I think another issue is
that Apple misinterpreted
the user demand especially with the gold
model because there's no reason why the
gold should be in a fewer it should be
less of them going around on the other
colors and besides apple chose to do it
that way or if there's some you no
problem with the the treatment process
to get the metal that color but that
should be unrelated to any fingerprints
you I think I think this is a feat for
Apple though because when they released
an a white iphone it took them oh my god
it was just gonna say took him forever
to get don't understand colors yeah well
they couldn't get it to match there's
white white and white white white and
we're getting the ladder and not the
former but they didn't know could make
it lunch with the accessories right was
that what it was it couldn't Lou was not
drying white it was drying yellow and it
wouldn't turn like the glue was supposed
to dry yellow and then turn white and it
wasn't curing correctly and it was
drying yellow and staying yellow so I
could believe that they would have a
similar plating problem with the with
the gold on this new thing you know as
when is gold gold we need gold why is
this champagne yeah exactly isham pagina
yeah this space gray is a little more
like outer space grant that's basically
look very good by the way I held yeah I
love them I love the contrast to the
black with the dark grey I think that's
the sharpest color scheme ever yeah you
like it better than the black 5 de blah
oh yeah I don't like the black 5 I mean
it's it's not like you whoa no it's it's
it's tough to photograph especially when
there's another phone in the frame like
the black just washes out into this is
that that's users big problem with their
phones I just came out my phone no it's
my problem when you asked my opinion no
and also in real life it's it's I don't
like it you yeah Taylor I know you and I
disagree here cuz you like all black
phones I find them so dull I really like
matte black everything yeah you're gonna
spray paint your car with some krylon
soon yeah well i hope that not a lot of
people are waiting for the 5s because
that would that would be a long time I
would be annoyed if but then again I
wouldn't have any standing to be annoyed
if I hadn't pre-ordered one if you
really wanted the 5s you stayed up until
3am or no you couldn't pre-order it you
so you know if you really wanted the 5s
you waited in line at four in the
morning and if you didn't do that then
you didn't
ipad enough yeah I don't understand why
there was no not reorder this year that
makes no sense they must have known that
there was gonna be this issue yeah
something I mean I don't know it just
doesn't make any sense he guess would
have frustrated a different quality of
customer the ones who get in early are
gonna get their phones and then yeah
pre-order shows about five minutes Yeah
right well I don't know I hope it's
resolved soon some people get their
hardware one other thing that's maybe a
little bit more difficult to resolve is
a hilarious I'm story because i'm not
one of the affected parties I guess if I
worry i guess i would find it less funny
iOS 7 is legit making people barf is
that correct Steven so they say there's
this the red going back having a week or
so now about people who know if they
first started downloading iOS 7 I assume
that their problems would be I don't
know how to do anything now I don't
recognize you know what I'm supposed to
do here but instead it's these the
transitions the zooms the animations
that are giving people who have a
tendency to motion sickness giving them
a little bit of nausea and they're
getting really be upset about this they
can do you can like tone down some of
the motion stuff like that parallax
effect but you just you can't turn it
all off and especially because this kind
of like random that was not going to
look the same if you are you know
opening a folder on different parts of
the screen its people say that they
their brain can't predict what's gonna
happen so it's greater disorientating
effect that it really upset about this
craziest thing I've ever heard I mean
I've heard of 3g if god I've heard of 3d
phone screen yeah people like I've all
problems and headaches and stuff and
that makes a little sense to me but like
this like what my brain can't process
two functions heaven and it wants and it
makes me sick and I get it like I you
know my initial impulse is to is to land
because this is an absurd story but it
is look all right if you get card if you
get very easily sick then I understand
how this could happen right but I don't
know what were we going to say saving
them I remember playing like old-school
first-person doom like games and it got
you a point in like the mid 90s where
the games were simple enough
the computer hardware was improving fast
enough that the frame way frame rates
are really really high so you said the
smooth you're gonna like streaming
through these tunnels especially the
games that had that sort of walking
bounce effect to them I would get a
little you know sick to my stomach after
dark force it's 20 minutes of that I
wouldn't know what's going on right
right so I get it I get how that can
translate to you know parallax stuff and
folder opens and closes I guess but I
don't know I I'm trying to retain my
ability to have a thick see here I just
I cannot get the picture out of my head
or somebody like using if an iphone and
it's just suddenly like a column of
vomit erupts from their mouth this is a
go it's like a south parker or family
guys yeah um Mia Farrow's Mia Farrow
just tweeted you will regret switching
to iOS 7 really initial target issue
issue sharing vomit stories as well
known but yeah there's a lot of back and
forth over it and and I definitively I
never would have said this before iOS 7
but I definitively said that in the
comparison yesterday I said that Android
actually looks better and it's because
it's it's more neutral it's not
overbearing this can be overbearing the
colors and the animations and everything
can be an overbearing so now the
question should Apple let people down
grade 26 that seems to be what they want
to happen an apple so far has been
towing the line that's we're not making
exceptions for y'all but yeah it seems
to be something that would remedy this
well what doesn't make sense to me is
why they can't just make it like a theme
hey revert using this yeah no no no no
no because that's what what would happen
if what would happen a facebook cowed to
the legions of people demanding that
they go back to the old version of
Facebook generation after generation can
you imagine having to support like the
equivalent of Facebook 20 in 2013 I mean
there would be they'll be crazy oh yeah
I was second people have to get used to
it people have to accept the change
unless they're vomiting and in which
case they should probably switch to
Android but like
everyone else needs to just suck it up
and understand that this is the new iOS
and if you don't like it then go to
another platform right well I can
totally nokia doing ads like Windows
Phone you're not going to bar let's make
a commercial let's all get together and
shoot this commercial this weekend that
sounds like fun so I don't know let's
let's just accept that technology
marches forward and you should stay with
it or there are alternatives if you
don't want to I don't see a lot of
people jumping ship from iOS because of
this I even asked my normal friends and
I'm like do you like it and they're like
yeah yeah I like it it's it's it's
cooler it feels like I have a new phone
yeah I agree there's been kind of a I
don't know a great divide between all my
friends and family some of them like it
some of them don't but the thing is like
I said this on the last podcast and
somebody told me I was wrong but I know
where he yeah yeah but he'd go figure
somebody tweeted me and they were like
you're wrong but uh what I said was
people don't like change until they get
used to the change and then they like it
that that's generally what happens
people don't like change because of
change and then they get used to
something it changes they're like I they
have this big freak out moment and then
they get over it yeah so yeah this
that's probably what'll happen here but
I think honestly why not just support
the old icons in the old interface I
mean not old interface it's the same
interface it just looks different look
at all the colors because every iphone
that people see on the street then and
they I mean I know there aren't many
people in the world have never seen an
iPhone before but anybody who's newly
exposed to an iphone it like takes the
iphones like how is this the iphone then
they look at it's like oh wow and they
associate whatever that old style is
with the iphone and that's no longer the
iphone so that's why it's important to
have cohesive visuals i really don't
think they should support old old
designs did I see what the video of the
baby reacting to iOS 7 no no I don't
watch baby videos ever you have to watch
that I just dropped it in the chat i
don't i don't i'm not going to do it
it's hilarious it's like 30 second
yeah you must do this for your fire
that's not happening that's not
happening where the problem is I don't
think I would have been man support a
video at the same time as I'm running a
podcast but I'm gonna look at this this
video is called baby and iOS 6 vs iOS 7
and there's a 13-second advertisement in
front of it which is fun I always like
to see the Snickers commercial again
with Kenny Kenny G that's a good time if
you can't pull a 240p video and stream
at the same time and all fragmented yeah
now it's happening all right so here's a
baby there's a card table this is
scintillating for our listeners I'm sure
they've all skipped the iOS section
anyway because everybody unpacking out
for some reason hates hates Apple unlock
baby unlocks the iphone and is tapping
away at which is cooks the baby looks
like it's at an executive meeting it
looks like it's really running things
and yeah and then there's iOS 7 and loot
the reaction moon has been swapped out
for one running iOS 7 the direction is
priceless baby look to the camera baby
takes a couple beats is chewing on its
cud and bP said four stomachs right yeah
it throws his hands up they're like hey
did you do the toddler legit did throw
it ends up there like I don't know what
to do with this I don't know why you
gave me this crap gets us away from me
wasn't bad it wasn't that interesting
that was not worth it Taylor Martin you
are fired I'm let the pic yeah I also
let dad I just love the reaction she's
like get this away from me I don't want
this it should really be called like
iphone that's on vs. iPhone that's not I
expected her to cry or something yeah me
too yeah yeah insufficient payoff Taylor
Martin is demoted to second lieutenant
that's what we call pulling a lost
theirs you shut up i like that finale
what the hell i'm the only one of the
only one guys I am I don't know about
you but I'm a little tired of talking
about Apple you think it's time to talk
about the green robot sure swell what do
I know I'm second lieutenant knows why
don't you go there to say shut up Anson
listen this note 3 next to me which we
talked about somewhat longer at the top
of the show then I wanted to got taken
out of its box the other day by me and
the home button is already all scratched
up go watch my unboxing but I've already
managed this
patch up the home button somehow which
is annoying yeah thanks man and I I do
not know what to make of this oh I I
just I don't understand it yet this is a
confusing device to me and probably
because it's so loaded with features and
this isn't such a bad thing this time
because I actually I actually do want to
try them a lot whereas with the s4 I was
kind of like wow there's a bunch of
features I don't care about on here but
there's some new note taking stuff
there's some new software that's bundled
in that takes advantage of the s-pen the
s pen itself can be inserted into the
silo in either direction it's like a
what yeah so it's like a lightning
connector it's like you doesn't matter
which direction it goes in which is
quite screen so you could actually put
the s pen in the phone and then use it
on like your Galaxy Tab or note hello
use the whole life there though no no no
sorry so like the old note you know how
you can only put in the S Pen facing one
direction so not not the ok then like
the tip is sticking out the bottom now
you can't do that so it's it's just the
same shape all the way around so it's
exactly right yeah well but that's cool
with me how many why would she have it
with the tip pointing no no that would
be really horrible no because with a
note 8 in the note too many many times I
would try and put the stylus in one way
and it didn't want to go in the way my
off frig all right I gotta turn it you
know those toddler games where do you
have to put a shape I grew up in the
circle yeah yeah Michael that's all I'm
gonna leave you with yeah you know what
shut up you you know what happen to you
too and I need a murder board and guys
do you know what started happening when
I started using the note 3 yesterday
heavily as my primary device pursuant to
this forthcoming review do you know what
occurred I don't it turned into a troll
I don't know no it's in fact it begun to
lag Eddings oh I'm really getting
annoyed at this twizz yeah yeah the
TouchWiz is getting to the point where
it is so bloated that it's it's slowing
down a device with three gigs of ram
thing running at an absurd clock speed
now I was going to do some investigative
reporting of my own and by that i mean i
was going to Google something but I
really should I should have enlisted
Taylor Martin for this because he is a
google master but I believe I have the
the sm n900 version here which is not
the one that sports the Snapdragon 800
and this always seems to happen to us
like we get the international version in
the international version in first and
then the US version follows weeks later
and man whether its Tegra or XO notes or
that other one that I'm forgetting like
they're all outclassed for me by the by
the Snapdragon devices and this appears
to be no exception so far because I've
managed to bog down this unit several
times and in fact it even froze on me
and required a hard restart yesterday
over dinner yeah so it says it's a it's
an Exynos 5 octa processor that's
powering my unit here it's the same one
that's and I think it's the same one
that's in the S there 5420 yet the new
one is that what it yes isn't what it is
exynos 5420 note 3 yeah yeah but you
know Samsung knows these phones lag like
they can't possibly know that they don't
right but because frickin user base
doesn't or professors not to because ya
know oh my never like let's hash net
yeah yes it does but Samsung you know
they're sitting there and they're
talking about this phone they're like
you know they're like in a boardroom or
something like yeah we're experiencing a
little lag and then some some IT guys
like sticks his hand up near he's like
you have too much software it's too much
bloat and then seems like we need these
features that's how I feel this goes
down like we absolutely need smart
rotate and smart scroll and and all
these things like nobody needs that
nobody make them apps that you can
download like that why not you know
that's that's not a terrible that's not
a terrible idea actually I never thought
of positioning it like what what phone
was I using where the the app swerve
there's like a host of downloadable apps
i think was the Lumia line a while back
like it didn't come
always come pre-installed with Nokia
stuff or something like that I don't
know there yeah yeah they the Nokia zone
the Nokia exclusive apps and the Samsung
zone and stuff like in the windows at
phone 8 model you can just go in there
and it's like oh here's a lot of
features it didn't get reloaded I can
download them if I want yeah like that
the Moto X is like that because what was
it skip that's not pre-installed you
have to download it Oh reg well skip
requires a piece of hardware mmm well no
I know that but I'm just saying it's
integrated in the software but all the
the bulk of the code is left out so they
implement it and then when it's like a
plug-in that you download from our place
board yeah I think so am sung they know
that people aren't going to be
downloading all these weird little
features that you're going to use once
and you'll we've said before this is
stuff it's designed for the showroom in
a lot of ways and having it all on the
phone they are ready to show off
probably makes it easier for samsung to
push these yeah well yeah but it didn't
same their specs samsung sitting here
thinking hey people are never using
these but hey let's show them that they
need to use them well obviously if
you're not using them and nobody's
actually going to use them ever then
it's a waste of time and space it's
marketing and the demo floor units can
have them installed well the songs
remove the product it doesn't matter if
it's actually on there not but that's
that's exactly the point I'm about to
make they're moving so much product
right now so that's that that's the
paradox we all seem to agree that there
are some shortcomings here as far as the
experience goes but the things are being
shoved their the audiences throughout so
aggressively that they're moving
millions and the nosewheel know six of
the biggest success stories we tell them
this is working keep doing this right
right right now you fall into this if
it's not broke don't fix it you know
mentality which I don't think I really
don't think that that's the right way to
think I hate I hate more than I can put
into words I hate that quote yeah it's
not broke don't fix it Riggins it
implies there's no need to develop it is
no need to each exactly to move there's
no need for innovation of eight yeah
yeah so anyway stupidest thing I've ever
heard in my life this is trebles uh yeah
this turned into a
and venting session not have a feeling
that idiom is broke and Taylor is in
need of fixing it see see there is
intelligent humor or on this program but
not when I'm around that's right but
anyway the note 3 is going to go into
the comparison trap today is going to be
compared with the note 2 i'm looking
forward to getting to know it better i
really liked the note to it was one of
my favorite devices i was formerly
looking forward to replacing with an 03
now i don't know i'm gonna get to know a
little better and we'll see how it goes
give it a shot Michael there was this
change and everyone's like well how's
the screen well the screens beautiful is
1080p you know it's uh put the moment I
swear it's bigger five-point diff phone
feels bigger you hold this thing next to
no 2 you're gonna say the same thing it
feels more cumbersome this thing has
almost fallen out of my hand so many
times maybe your hands are shrinking
that could be i am getting smaller in my
old age i'm just i'm just starting to
stoop over i'm starting to wear glasses
civility is is working on you making a
nice hunk yeah yeah yeahs hump as well
so hunchback watchin yes you know it
might be because it's dinner it might be
because it is it is slimmer it is more
difficult to hold well yeah i've just
that doesn't mean it makes it feel
bigger you don't know Taylor I'm not
inside mine is orientated the saying is
harder to hold so it must be bigger go
away leave the show samsung has done
something interesting with the note 3
and a couple other devices recently
that's got a lot of people up in arms
and I'm going to tell you guys I sent
you the podcast rundown 45 minutes
before we started recording and then I
used 26 of those minutes trying to
understand this issue and I do not get
it Samsung is region locking some of
these devices so that apparently on
first activation if you use a sim that
is not appropriate for the geographic
area of the globe that you are in the
phone will fail to activate so what you
have to do is use a sim for the flu like
the sticker on the back side of my box
was this is for the north american
market only or the american market only
so it'll only work with those carriers
so you have to do that first and then
you can take your phone to any other
country and pop a statement if you want
as long as you initially activate it in
the country it was designed or shipped
to is that right that's what I've been
getting that impression from more recent
comments the first statement Samsung
made it was just missing German of the
translation was incredibly wonky and it
seems to guest exactly the opposite but
I think what's actually happening is is
more the way you're pairing it where you
have to activate it in one of the native
countries first before it can be
unlocked for use elsewhere yeah and this
is this is unprecedented cuz it seems
like a whole a region such as carrier
specific you know and I i I've already
said that I don't fully understand the
issue but I the way I've read it seems
to indicate to me that the massive like
blow back on this that this is the thing
that was out causing everybody such
outrage yesterday was that it seemed
that these devices would never work with
other sims like you activated with one
salmon then you can't swap sims like at
least that those are like the tweets I
was reading and then people are like the
g and GS m stands for global idiots and
I'm like this can't be though this can't
be what's happening so even if it is the
way you're saying I still think it's as
big a deal that Samsung putting its nose
in this business that the customers
simply don't think it has a right to be
doing it's kaelyn it's different but
it's still no peddling so is that is
that it i mean like in why are they
doing it i mean the easiest answer would
be that samsung doesn't want phones
exported to countries that they're not
that they don't want them to be sold in
why because the experience is not
tailored for that specific market
because they don't want devices in
markets yet where they don't have a what
and advertising presence like i don't i
don't understand Samsung's stake in this
it could be a governmental thing like a
legal matter no Samsung did say to a
twitter user this is there's an update
on the story from NDTV where a samsung
germany apparently told this twitter
user Jan ole that
the region lock is there to prevent
cheap imports so there that is so this
is like pretending grey market John's
and it's about setting prices in certain
areas they don't want you buying it
where the phone sold for less and
bringing it in I guess I don't know yeah
I guess so I mean this is that area
where this is why and a lot of
comparisons have been made to like DVD
region lock ass right widget evil games
which I have never understood that
either so I this is completely area into
alien territory to me but I I can
understand why people would be
frustrated about this like what's what's
the analogy is when it's like when
carriers start meddling with software
and stuff like it's kind of that thing
it's like you don't belong this is not
your your role you know stop stop
sticking your nose in it as you say so I
mean think this is getting cleared up
though so yeah it's it brings back
memories of when I was selling the
iphone when I was working in retail and
we were selling I believe it was the
iPhone 4 or 4s I don't remember but uh
people came in and it was a launch day
and a guy tried to buy three of them he
was not a native american and native it
wasn't a narrative Americans if it
wasn't native to America and he clearly
barely spoke English and we asked him
why he wanted him and he would never
answer us and we can't sell them if we
know that somebody is going to export
them that was that was the rule right so
tell her you're right it may well be I
had forgotten about that that issue like
where it's like yeah the manufacturers
have a vested interest in preventing
this this this import fraud or whatever
but but this is nothing new right now
this is yeah this this regional lock is
yeah yeah it's not something I'm the
issue is not even think it's just
another solution for that yeah yeah so
we will follow this story I'm sure that
it's going to resolve itself once once
we no longer have to translate press
announcements because I think a lot of
this was coming from Samsung Germany and
like a lot of the info was getting lost
due to bad translations and it's like
okay someone who knows if you know
something about this let us know drop us
a line in the comments
I want to talk about this marriage
dissolving between HTC and beats who is
shedding some tears over this no one can
we do a party yeah beats is buying back
at stake in no 8 ok beats is buying back
HTC's stake in beats which started as a
fifty percent stake in the company in
July and then july twenty twelve
diminished to twenty-five percent wooden
beats bought back half of it now they're
just buying back the whole thing so i
know was the weirdest partnership to
begin with well it was it made no it
made a degree of sense to me i
understand that culturally the two
companies are not similar but think
about it you have a smartphone maker
that wants to differentiate based on the
couple factors that other people aren't
focusing on it makes sense to ally
yourself with a well-known brand in that
field and that was beats and you know it
was having the Beats Audio brand on
smartphones I was I've kind of always
been ok with it because like I say it's
a differentiator it's like oh that's the
phone with beats that's cool can I
listen to it at least he gets a
conversation started it may taste unlike
everything else they had the headphones
that made sense but when they started
branding beats as this you know the the
equalizer that I think was pushing it
too far for me well and not the problem
right I mean it was because the end the
experience that was delivered ultimately
wasn't terrible yeah good now listen
though you know we're quick to jump on
beats as being this crappy things like
it's just an EQ setting you just amps up
the beat the base and the volume and
that's basically what beats does it's an
audio profile right really all it is
same time I haven't been able to
replicate it using other other
enhancements and do you want to that's
the thing yes we in one very specific
circumstance I absolutely do want to and
that is riding on the loud loud subway
and when I turn beats on on an HTC phone
I can hear everything much better when
there's a lot of ambient noise in the
background so it is used in that why are
you using your audio yeah just just just
get it like i'm using headphones what
you guys think I'm like blasting my
speaker from
on the train what do you think a little
snug all around the year the big old
ones oh you're flying in the air yeah
that's an awesome idea because I want to
carry around one other thing when I'm
carrying around four phones I think you
do yes give some a THM 50s and you'll
thank me later okay yeah thanks no I
would much prefer to just have smaller
buds and have a bladder noise but anyway
I I don't think anyone has ever been
really satisfied with the actual end
result but I thought that I thought that
HTC was going to get a lot out of it and
I guess that didn't happen but I don't
think guys tell me if I'm wrong I could
never see what beats was getting out of
this what kind of exposure was beats
anticipating like you know money that's
the only thing the way I guess I can
sort of see it like a giving them more
credibility because that people have
always thought of it like we were just
talking he just amps up the bass and the
volume but this they're getting involved
with the technology company toe baby
beets is smart or maybe it's more
advanced than we gave it credit for okay
alright and yeah but I got a beats phone
it didn't come with Beats headphones
maybe I'll buy some be exact I was just
gonna say this gonna drive the sales of
like beats hardware like headphones
hardware is that what they're where they
were coming out with us maybe and then
beats is like no your phones aren't
selling piece yeah and meanwhile beats
is doing mic drop he's doing better than
it was like HTC continues to suffer
despite doing a lot of things right in
my opinion as far as hardware goes men
but but beats is like something like
fifty nine percent bigger than it was a
year ago or something that number is
completely bogus but I can't source it
right now so beats is in bid beach is
doing better than HTC I think we can all
agree these do better beats doing better
but that's said so we don't know right
now the story is not clear they say
they're going to maintain a relationship
of some kind that sounds like damage
control PR talk to me I don't think
that's going to happen and I do you guys
think the brand is going to disappear
from HTC devices the Beats Audio Brad I
wouldn't be surprised I mean they've
been scaling back the relationship for a
while nail yeah I mean I will be very
happy not to have the stupid beats logo
in my notification area anymore but this
I don't know I always get weird when a
very visible differentiator goes
way and as much as we make fun of it
having beats audio on the back of a
smartphone I still think was a pretty
cool call out it was it was at least a
point of discussions like how Wow what's
that mean you know actually yeah I have
seen conversations sparked up just
because of beats on the phone heavy
really yeah yeah is it a note launch
event actually back in the day yeah oh
and uh HP was doing a partnership with
beads to actually does the touchpad have
the Beats Audio Brandon yes right here
not branding but it has Beats Audio it
has Beats Audio yeah so maybe they're
gonna be all up in HP's girl from Iran
out but that would be that would be very
funny because HP is like it isn't HP
talking about releasing windows phones I
hope not yeah we'll see before we move
on to windows phone by the way we want
to talk one last time about the Samsung
Galaxy gear and buy one last time I mean
hopefully one last time before we
actually get one of our own which was
supposed to happen I think today but
they were delayed in their shipping to
the vendor we were talking about getting
it from so don't know what the story is
with the gear really looking forward to
reviewing it but Samsung i love this
headline samsung galaxy gear lacks
something special says company official
like wow my foot there they go just
shoot right in the middle there was like
i could fit in my mouth pretty well so
the galaxy gear was being discussed
there's a there's a report on the Galaxy
gear from Samsung quoting who is this
this is Samsung's executive vice
president for the company's mobile
business marketing Lee hyung Lee
jung-hee who's quoting a samsung
official we're not sure if it was a
different one or the executive VP above
this is kind of a weird translation that
believes we've acknowledged that our
gear lacks something special with more
investment for user interface and user
experience Samsung devices will be
better in terms of customer satisfaction
I have no idea ugly it is that it is not
not pretty the wart on it
big ol laser work yeah the wort is
located in the most scuffed up place
unreasonable this is damaged waiting to
happen yeah I wonder if that's a
sapphire lens on their care if it is it
better be better be like a man or
something he would be yeah I am beating
up my pebble something fierce to man I'd
ever since I got my pebble I've been
walking into door frames like yeah like
like I never come bump into anything or
scraped my arm owned anything before but
I started wearing a watch and it's like
everything everything me you know it's
it's it's funny or not you're just like
every if you're like me you're just
scuffing it like it's it's a matter of
millimeters of clearance which leads me
to believe that actually I've just spent
my whole life taking corners really
tight with like very little immigrants
and the watch is actually interfering
with that now I actually take corners so
tight that I actually have to make a
sound when i get like yeah yeah well
yeah mine is beat all the crap like my
the face of my pebble is you have to
like that yeah well and they've kept an
angle it to see through the scratches to
see the time and the pebble takes that
beating like a champ like i mean- has
been great but so i wonder how the gear
is gonna do it I like that it's made of
now I held this thing at Aoife and I
don't think I either didn't ask the
question I did ask the question i think
it is stainless steel if you go back and
look at my hands on you can just run
that but i think it's stainless steel so
i think it's real metal so not to worry
about the casing i am worried about
breaking the screen if a stainless steel
takes dings and shows them pretty well
that's gonna get all mart up right quick
yeah no I don't mean I think
cosmetically it will not do well but I
just mean like in terms of breaking did
oh yeah why hold together yeah so I'm
very excited did you guys watch
inspector gadget as kids yes I didn't
know I wasn't a healthy young child is
there sarcasm there saving I can't tell
of course I wishes well do you remember
Penny's computer watch yeah yeah that's
I want I said the second area in a book
so she had a computer book and she had a
computer watch and the computer watch by
the way so I told to developers on
Twitter yesterday I was like listen to
me I
crisp hundred-dollar bill for the first
developer to build an app that resembles
pennies smartwatch and it has to do a
couple things and somebody suggested
that it should have pennies watches
laser built in as well but and she come
with a dog's collar with the yeah with
extendable radio as well I said that
there had to be some footage of brain in
there to qualify and some authentic
sound effects so maybe we'll get that
I'm really jazzed about the gear I don't
think it's going to be reviewed terribly
well I don't I think it's an overwrought
and undercooked product you got to try
it but I'm so excited to try it yeah
it's like the epitome of of going too
far in the wearable tech geeks space and
it's from Samsung I have to admit if
this was from another manufacturer I
wouldn't be giving at the time of day
pardon the pun but don't bum but and
it's not because I'm a samsung fanboys
because Samsung is massive and they are
they're not only building this but
they're pairing it with their most
visible smartphone release of the season
in the note 3 and they're saying use
this with your note 3 I think that's
pretty cool I just how they bungled in
not having the software for the s4
you're ready to go right out the door
that's another point doesn't make sense
you got to wait until december for that
right yeah also why is AT&amp;amp;T selling
pebbles can anybody answer yeah because
AT&amp;amp;T I was just in an AT&amp;amp;T store
yesterday second largest US carrier for
our non-american listeners and AT&amp;amp;T is
freaking large and in charge with regard
to offering stuff they're renovating our
stores into much more welcoming places
they have the I think they want to
position themselves to be like the best
buy of the carrier retail model like
they have everything and I just mean an
inventory not in god I hope not in
customer service you know it's like they
have so much stuff and I that's why I
love it I'll go to the mall and I'll
spend by the sprint kiosk just because
you know memories but they don't have
anything compelling and I'll go to the
verizon one and I'm like okay you guys
have got some interesting stuff and then
t-mobile is always fun to go in for the
novelty and the you know the uncarrier
stuff and the windows phones but then I
just go in 18 team like wow you guys
have legit everything
yeah from well I mean that's how many
new devices AT&amp;amp;T gets to verizon which
is much larger absolute or somewhat
larger I mean it's verizon's gotten four
or five new phones in the past couple
months 18 he's got like 99 rise against
aren't the ones everyone wants there's
no deal like the droid razr yeah and
here's real just like I used to I used
to have a very different perception of
AT&amp;amp;T before I moved to Boston because
they didn't perform well where I used to
live and in boston they really really
perform better than variety outperform
verizon pretty much everywhere but
that's not interesting and everyone's
already tuning out because i don't care
about American carriers apparently in
their audience however the cool thing
about this from a business perspective
is AT&amp;amp;T had the iphone exclusivity and
they had locked it down for like five
years or something turned out to be four
years whatever finally verizon gets the
iphone 4 and that that that exclusivity
is broken the iphone is like escaping
the clutches of AT&amp;amp;T and the company
took that lesson they saw that coming
and they actively worked to get other
exclusives so they were the biggest
windows phone 7 launch partner they turn
that into a Windows Phone a very visible
windows phone 8 partnership which has
had its ups and downs that we've talked
about but at least they're very visible
in that space and they decided to carry
as many Android phones as they could
even while they still had that iphone
exclusivity so this is a really good
example of forward-looking strategy I
think from a from a US carrier so that's
why ATT is selling the pebble Taylor
because they are as they they want to to
have ever expanding which is club I
think it's cool engadget just ran a
headline Apple photo patent declared
invalid as it has already been shown by
Apple so they apply for a patent that
they already had well yeah i think that
sends a nice message that that we're
through with the android category we're
already jumping to other store before we
go to where we go yeah the galaxy gear
i'm wondering if that comment about it
not being special means anything about
what we've heard that Sam
really wants to get this galaxy gear 2
out the door like early early next year
and it's just waiting for a little
feedback on the first one before
announcing it at CES or something what
do you think they're going to dump what
galaxy gear on the market and then like
four months later to a galaxy gear to
that's what the river was saying it
seemed ridiculous but now if they really
feel that the source was not special
might make sense that's why you you kind
of pick the market release a prototype
to a couple journalists or something and
then actually work on the next product
that like not just hey here's a phone or
here's a here's a SmartWatch and then
three months later here's another one
like nobody wants that that's gonna make
a lot of you do like galaxy glass or
something you take your time you work
yesterday glass Google glass Noel galaxy
glass is gonna be hilarious when that
gets released in a month and a half look
it's just like the Google glass except
it's gotten a bunch of gesture
controlled stuff way to sit on past this
headband you shake your head rapidly
back and forth to Mexico once the Star
Wars guys Lobo oh wait the cloud city
guy oh yeah with the thing around the
back of us yeah attaches directly to
your occipital lobe convulse too close
you know Gigi convulse to close would be
an awesome feature uh listen I mean I
should patent these things I think
that's the clothes cross your eyes to
zoom right I think that it would be very
smart if Samsung to skip the galaxy gear
and go right to the galaxy gear 2 for
the reasons you were a state achievement
I gotta say selfishly if that happens
I'm gonna be really mad and I'm gonna be
like beating Sun store down like give me
one of those first ones gotta try it out
I'll be real mad I've been real mad
let's move on to windows microsoft has
announced the surface 2 and the surface
pro 2 i want to mention we touched on
this briefly in the last show and then
most of that was edited out but we were
in fact yeah invited to this event but
that invite came through too late there
was some serious confusion on the
communication side so for people
wondering why we were not there what
happened was we didn't get the invite
until after the event was done and then
we've got to follow curiously before
that though we got a follow-up email
like two days later after this event we
didn't go to
title them how did you like the surface
event I'm like um okay invention that
yeah so but fortunately you know so it
was it was very nice to be invited next
time we'll get it better before we can
be there but the surface and surface pro
2 what do we think about this guy steven
has a nice write-up what are you what
are your thoughts circus pro two sounds
great surf is too worried about so what
does the surface to run is it windows RT
again is it the last hour T fried 8.1
windows RT no I think they're sticking
with rt for the launch dropping the
moniker on the hardware which is you
know which is good yeah cuz that's kind
of confusing it yeah it's kind of
confusing and and I think it's less
ambiguous to consumers but then they're
gonna realize after they buy it but it
doesn't run everything they want it to
run you know I didn't give the sales
guys do a good enough job at describing
the difference it'll be okay and most
people are Phil are associated already
with this thing of like here's product
here's product pro you know I don't
think that's a new model that people are
going to have to get used to I think
it'll be all right what about this uh
this music thing they introduced yeah
alternate keyboard cover said came out
of nowhere so first of all the existing
touch cover has but it has been slimmed
by something like what half a millimeter
and also a backlight has been installed
which i think is really awesome the
touch cover was like one of those things
that I really loved about the first
surface I it works horribly I couldn't
use it no I can't use it either I'd like
it's it's horrible to type on but it's
so good looking that I just honor I'm so
shallow but now they've done a backlight
in and not only have done that made it
slimmer but they've also boosted the
sensor count like the first touch cover
at 80 sensor so I guess one sensor perky
which made sense right but this one has
a thousand touch sensors so like
essentially the entire surface of the of
the cover is is a touch sensor so you
will not miss as many keystrokes is the
message i'm taking from this but then
there's this one this alternate touch
cover that you can buy if you're a what
Stephen a DJ I guess
it's got the sliders it's got controls
for your sequencer it's I want to buy
one just because I'm not a DJ but it
looks like a like transporter control
console it's cool it's just such a weird
specific music for a I assume it's going
to be expensive to happen announced the
price this has got to be eighty ninety a
hundred dollars right it's just it's
weird I feel like Microsoft's trying
really really hard to like make
themselves seem like Appling I don't
know it's gonna be a garage band you're
gonna plug it into your music equipment
it's gonna be it's functional it's not
just a toy right and it's functional in
this niche in this niche space well but
that space is also like perceived as
cool like they had a guy for the DJ from
Lincoln Park talking about this thing
out of it i believe the part as a DJ
right right so anyway there's that i
think that's that's really weird but
what's the what's the deal not on the
hardware of the surface to what's been
what's been boosted here so George
screen 1080p screen well they it it had
1080p border fanservice bro no oh no the
surface RT was 13 by 7 something seven
something yet no are you talking about
surf stewardship program with the
service to I don't want to buy the pro
yet yeah so the real surface to or they
actually is there there's an adjustable
kickstand on the surface 20 yeah both of
them have the tube a kickstand okay so
you have a 20 degree in 40-degree angle
which is cool because that was one of
the primary complaints about the first
services like it only stands up at this
one angle so it still won't center in
your lap right but you know apparently
that's not something we need to talk
around Apple flatter lap dude no I think
it was ten I was reading a daniels piece
and he said that it actually works in
your lap now the 40 degree angle yeah
whatever there's there's two we'll see
not that I know that I'm saying like
whatever to detect crunches report but
it's like I'm trying to envision this
thing in my lap with two long narrow
points of contact going horizontally and
I remember how that feels with the first
surface I don't know whatever we'll give
it a shot I am NOT not hopeful about it
but I still love that kickstand so hard
that I think it'll be alright I love it
so hard what's so hard
it has a Tegra 4 chip which is extremely
powerful as i experienced myself with
the Nvidia shield so at one point seven
gigahertz quad-core Tegra 4 with the
same storage capacity but it has double
the ram so went from two to four gigs of
ram but still 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage I mean twenty percent increase
or twenty-five percent increase in
battery life the display is resolutions
boosted with better colour reproduction
and angles so viewing angles i believe
and USB 3.0 bluetooth 4.0 and possibly
LTE or no definitely LT in the future
maybe this else is coming it might not
be there's a theory going around we're
only going to get the surface mini in
LTE I don't know if any truth to that
but and then the surface pro has kind of
similarly interesting but also iterative
improvements we have what is this a
75-percent extension of battery life
which is pretty awesome because the pro
the first run of the probe kind of
suffered in that area because it was
running so powerful 5000 graphics
performance as well yeah it's got a high
five has bowl at 1.6 gigahertz ok us too
up to 512 gigabytes of storage so 64 128
256 and 512 of I guess last original yes
and my first two so 64 and 128 come with
four gigs of ram the last 2 256 and 512
come with eight gigs I think that's
really interesting and sort of speaks to
how we're getting this convergence
between tablets and laptops I can't
remember a tablet or a bonus giving
users a choice of multiple Ram
configurations before no I know sorry
what are those Ram choices again to get
work for or 84 or eight okay then that's
cool and that's exactly what Microsoft
is doing with the surface pro right so
it makes sense that they would they
would they would offer that I think
that's that's a pretty cool first
they've also got a docking station that
they're bringing along with USB 3.0 port
and mini DisplayPort and ethernet and
then in plenty of regular old USB ports
that's pretty cool so the pro looks to
be that thing but but I still
I don't know I I didn't use the pro as
long as our friend Adam Lane did and he
loves his pro and my friend I was just
having dinner with my friend Chris last
night his mother apparently has a
surface pro and I'm like what did she do
and he's like well she's a housewife
Michael so she needed a nine hundred
dollar gambling that's like what are you
talking about so but apparently you know
it's a lovable product I just don't
understand like what what what drives
you to do that if you have you have all
this all these windows 8 laptops out
there these notebooks with touch screens
and stuff so and they are presumably a
little easier to use you don't have to
detach components by special accessories
for ports and things like that sand
there there we're talking we're not too
far apart in price here when you start
talking about the surface pro with all
these optional add-ons so so why are
people gonna buy the surface pro I mean
people besides people who want to you
need to like illustrate on the screen
and stuff and use the flexibility I mean
the for windows 8 the ability to drop
the keyboard off that that's it really
okay I mean I've been contemplating the
yoga by I guess it's lenovo yeah but
it's just too big it's really cool it's
too big it's too expensive but this
thing if I got I'm just saying I don't
use Windows I don't really like windows
all that much just at least not windows
8 256 gigabytes with the keyboard the
touch cover or type cover whichever I
don't know what it is touch cover I
could see myself using that like that
would be helpful for events because it's
got enough horsepower to video edit it's
got enough ram it's got enough it's got
an i5 Haswell so why wouldn't that be a
little more logical than my macbook pro
which is enormous and heavy if you're
running around like CES ok so you're
talking about a weight savings yeah but
you can't yeah well I will one we won't
know until we can actually put one in
our lap but I don't think you I still
don't think you can type in your lap of
them anyway I don't want to harp on on
that point I want to know I want to know
from from listeners who who this device
who actually wants one of these devices
a surface 2 or a surface approach
and I want to know the use case that
you're planning on using then I can't
promise that I'm like building a piece
on this or anything I'm just actually
legitimately curious because this seems
like something that would have spoken to
me in college where I'm like I'm running
around campus all day right say in this
imaginary world I don't own a macbook
air already which is the ultra portable
which I prefer in which i use sadness my
air i'm against my hair because you're
using a pro I sold my protocol there's
so many to get the pro so the thing is
though like get back I want to know what
the price growing cycle in my head yeah
in my head and then you've got the air
11 too so in a way you there's a lot
going on here I want to know why people
are planted about the surface 2 and
there are events going on in Microsoft
stores around the country right now or
they will be kicking off shortly where
you can get a hands-on special preview
of the surface 2 in the surface pro 2
and that's going to be pretty cool from
what I understand maybe I'll go through
the microsoft store but worthy starting
apparently allegedly that is a good
question and i'm looking it up right now
Adam Lane gave me the heads-up on this
because of Oh what did he say because i
was looking servers to rumor roundup
surface to launch event tell you're
supposed to like talk while I do this
holding over up my guess your I have
something to say this reminds me about
kia the google glass events that google
announced yesterday toeffler are you
anywhere near durham are you gonna
attend that the globe their moment
durham there is oh heck yeah i'm about
two hours away where everyone is this
win is this october fed something all
day long for my 10 a.m. saturday yeah
heck yeah i'm going there we go all
right try on glass talk to the google
engineers that's pretty cool i'm still
I'm so baby and I haven't use google
glass yet I'm so so maybe we should do
something with this I'll be there on
Saturday yeah I verse top durham north
carolina yeah okay
sure i'll stop by i'll stop by the the
luxury car lot on the way you so this is
events at microsoft have started already
Monday September 30th is the first one
on the Microsoft Store facebook account
facebook.com slash microsoft store and
this will be kicking off in seattle
washington at the microsoft store
university village get a sneak peek at
surface to surface pro 2 and the team
behind it with Panos Panay it's going to
be there excuse me Panos Panay you get
it and then this goes to San Francisco
Los Angeles Houston Miami Chicago New
York Boston which will be on October
sixteenth and and that's where it looks
like it ends so check it out if you guys
want to see the surface to surface pro 2
listeners before they get unveiled go to
a microsoft store on one of these events
if you live near once again facebook.com
slash microsoft store if you're jazzed
about did was there anything near me I
wasn't listening get off get up get off
my podcast going oh yeah I'm or skiing
for this glass thing alright yet to RSVP
well RSVP then I am listen some of the
last devices bearing the nokia brand
might see they're unveiling very soon
we're getting rumors from a couple
sources i think steven wright that nokia
is going to have like a half dozen
models to announce at this october event
nokia world that's what they're saying
at least two of them should be Lumias so
yeah they're probably be a punk shash is
there but also see yeah that's the thing
like a headline i vs oh my god i was
sweet and then I'm like oh wait they
make all that lowend crappy yeah so but
it apparently is wonderful oh n stuff
anyway I take back the crap comment but
we're excited about Lumias here so the
obvious thing as Steven point sounds the
Lumia 1520 phablet and maybe to ashes or
something and then there's a room there
were rumors of a lighter weight or a
cheaper Lumia 920 so that's in the 929
the one the verizon one right yeah and
then so assume to Lumia has two or three
ashes and there's there is still room in
there for a tablet which
feel like these nokia tablet rumors keep
getting more steam rather than less I
did what is your opinion on that student
having been plugged in for a froot a bit
yeah for a while if I think we were
building up to an actual launch but now
but I don't know it feels like it's a
lost track or derail I'm just not sure
when the announcement might be it seems
I'm hesitant to believe that it could be
lumped in with everything else here
because it feels like it should be a
bigger deal than just here are five
other things oh and also our first
tablet right and again I don't know
where else they would announce this so
exactly because like what there's only a
limited amount of time before this
transaction this purchase finally gets
authorized and no cabe this division
within nokia becomes Microsoft so maybe
this is just going to be the the last
hurrah and the big blow out there were
those rumors also the Microsoft was
trying to convince nokia to forget about
the tablet they didn't want the
competition Serpas to right which would
be interesting I didn't it would be very
very interesting if this tablet were to
be released and just to do a comparison
surface 2 vs nokia windows RT sloughed
how long he an expensive comparison yeah
yeah would happy so awful in nokia just
trounced microsoft in every possible way
yeah well it would be fine because then
you know then they would get bought and
in the you know it's an harris gee i
wonder what the losses the brain drain
is going to be like at this this
acquisition and this is just you know
not I have nothing to back this up I've
spoken I've not recently spoken to any
nokia employees and asked about the
feelings within the nokias culture with
regard to Microsoft culture but I can
there's supposed to be acquiring what
thirty eight thousand employees in the
in this division and I don't know how
many of them are going to want to stick
around we've already heard about all
those people forming up for an Android
project is x nokia worker there's what
didn't something go around about this or
am i just speculate in here what
it's might know something about it I
don't I know bring exactly that I mean I
know that wasn't it yotaphone was it
does that one what about you then ratio
yes yola and then Yolo Yolo selfish but
they're doing their own thing with the
sailfish OS yeah aren't they x nokia one
of the next okay yeah well no yo lies
yeah there's a lot of extra okay people
with any other yeah no wholesome maybe
it'll be something that yukia what your
kid you've got to be kidding me yeah
it's so gonna get sooo new the amount
like the first week in September there
was talk about these ex-employees
getting together and doing something and
Roy D founder says new Kia branding will
not be on its phone yo Kia's founder or
interim CEO told me just really want to
get suits the idea with the naming here
Wow Dukey a new Kia yeah that's funny
that is funny somebody's got a sense of
humor yeah that's that's funny ok well
let's get live from ZDNet nokia is dead
newquay arises from its ashes I was
pretty fins oh that's great well we will
have to look into that once we have
something solid on that that's maybe
hasn't been reported yet we'll discuss
it maybe next week if there's room but I
think we should close it up for today
boy so that we can do some comparison
videos and you know do some reporting on
the news what do you think Steven and I
suppose it has to happen sooner or later
