years of iPhone but also a decade for
the modern smartphone at this point
younger generations have no clue just
how much smartphones changed after 2007
navigation buttons and keyboards were
killed in favor of slimmer designs and
multi-touch controls and that was the
primary first step into how everything
has evolved until today about the only
problem is that Hardware grew stale the
game transformed into more of a war of
ecosystems every other iPhone after the
first was more of an iteration sure they
got larger far more powerful and brought
new features all details will provide in
this chart on our website but the
primary reason for the love of Loyalists
than the pan of power users was that if
you placed an iPhone on a table it was
really hard to tell this newer iPhone
apart from the older one this is one of
the main reasons why the iPhone 10 is so
important never has Apple deviated from
the things that made an iPhone and
iPhone so much this is really the first
time that visual iteration makes a jump
to visual innovation and Tim Cook's
words the future of the smart but the
question is of this first step is good
enough to define how the future of
smartphone should be I'm high mentally
that with pocket now and this is our
iPhone 10 review brought to you by D
brand
if I could describe the iPhone 10 in a
word I think that different would suit
at best I spent the first week trying to
press a home button that no longer
existed and that every smartphone has
these days the radius curves now
extended the display which has now
shrunk the bezels almost entirely the
stainless steel trim in the glass are
now shaped to evoke seamless integration
between each other and I'm glad I chose
Space Gray as it lends to a darker tint
in the overall finish in the hand this
phone feels heavier than it looks and
also feels smaller than it looks as well
my problems with the designer obviously
that the glass is a fingerprint magnet
which is where I'd recommend that you
use a D brand skin as a solution I'm
also not a fan of this camera hump that
has become quite the lint magnet given
the sharp borders it almost makes it
seem like if this phone was designed to
be used with the case and wear leather
is so far one of my favorite
alternatives if you came here to hear
complaints about the knotch
you've come to the wrong place sure it
looks like a mall if you're watching a
video in full-screen but I'd prefer the
knotch anyday in a smaller form factor
over the last 10 years of huge bezels
see what makes the iPhone 10 special is
that it's nearly all display this 5.8
inch OLED panel is the most dense that
Apple has ever provided it's also
vibrant inaccurate and the miniscule
black bezel along with the stereo
speakers lend to a very immersive
experience consuming content and then
tucked inside we have almost the same
specifications of the iPhone 8 plus
meaning yes this phone is very powerful
we have the same a11 Bionic chip with
three gigs of ram and my unit is of 64
gigs of storage
there's ip67 water in this resistance qi
wireless charging bluetooth 5 and about
everything else you'd ask from a
flagship except for the headphone jack
which I feel that we should just give up
on when it comes to Apple
i OS 11 on the iPhone 10 has proven to
be a very interesting transition there
are still old elements like the
forgettable grid of icons you can still
swipe to the left from the launcher for
widgets you can still use 3d touch for
contextual menus even if these are still
inconsistent the death of the home
button brings some benefits and some odd
choices for design
I love swiping up to get home from any
app as it feels like if you're throwing
the application back in the launcher
makes sense
I love switching applications with a
simple swipe to the left or right even
if the ripe app switching is not always
available or only last for a few seconds
oh and to call other applications make a
flipped L which is quicker than swiping
up and holding at first this learning
curve was a pain but after a week I
found a lot of common sense in it even
the shiny home button indicator is a
cool addition which can even lead to
some smiley faces depending on which app
you're using the things I don't like her
the weird choices like having the home
button icon flip around if you're
watching a video which can lead to a ton
of confusion or the status icons at the
top which don't seem aligned waste space
and don't show all the information you
want and whoever came up with this idea
of swiping from the top left for
notifications in the top right for
control center like seriously and then
the app status continues to get better
as I've noticed more services adapting
to the iPhone 10 screen real estate
but essentials like Google are still
lagging behind than a few applications
like inbox which I care about a lot
overall I guess the best way to describe
the software experience is that it's
still a work in progress
and yes I do have to agree this is the
longest I've ever tested a phone now
clocking nearly six weeks in New York
City on Lunas Hawaii California and New
Orleans you name it
the season has just been too crazy so
far I'm not much of a fan of using this
phone for calls as they aren't as loud
as I'm used to with iPhones and I've
even noticed the not interference from
the earpiece in certain areas though
they work just fine over the speaker
face ID is one of those things I'd never
thought I'd get used to but I have I
love how you can get notifications to
only show the content once the phone has
unlocked and I also love that face ID
even works from a minor angle those n
emojis are sadly not something I ever
used again after my honeymoon period but
I'm sure they're fun to use at least for
some of you things I do use every now
and then our a our kit applications I
love how they provide added convenience
--iz and being able to measure things or
test products with ease this is one of
those features that I feel this pointing
in the right direction along with just
how well this phone performs whether
it's gliding through menus are playing
games the experiences extremely fluid I
just wish my experience with battery
life was just this good but sadly it's
not our own Anton D nage has achieved
full days on a charge without a problem
but my unit sadly scratches a day of use
and I think it has everything to do with
the fact that this phone is sporting an
Intel modem and not a qualcomm modem as
users have been able to verify and then
there's the camera iPhones are usually
devices you can trust for all auto
photography and the iPhone 10 is almost
at the top of the food chain second only
to the pixel to excel great results
during the day with great saturation and
detail even if a tad overexposed in some
cases though like photography is also
top-notch leading to some of the best
photos I've shared on Instagram lately
about the only thing that I cannot
recommend about this phone in any way is
portrait mode either this phone doesn't
lighten my natural highlights or it just
has a very hard time detecting hair or
items like glass which are completely
muted seriously if devices like the
pixel 2 wouldn't exist then this could
probably be acceptable but this is one
beta that Apple really needs to work on
what I'm very impressed about is video
you may not get the manual controls you
get from an LG be 30 but the resulting
clips from this phone don't make you
really ask for them details are great
stabilization is great and this is still
one of the only devices not just phones
capable of 4k video at 60 frames per
second and 1080p slow-motion video at
240 frames per second I just wish that
the selfie camera would have this same
stabilization for video but at least
Apple is offering a wider crop now
making this camera good enough for
vlogging this is also the first time
that I'm able to survive with
entry-level storage on an iPhone Apple
support for HEV C makes both photo and
video storage a breeze and I love how
applications I don't use are offloaded
until I need them overall I'm gonna have
to admit that I have more positive
things to say about the iPhone 10 the
negative I usually never recommend first
generation Apple products given my
horrible sob stories with products like
the first Apple watch or the first
retina MacBook Pro I thought the story
would repeat itself with the iPhone 10
but it really hasn't the iPhone 10 may
not be as revolutionary as the first
iPhone and defining the basis for how a
smartphone should operate but I also
cannot say that the first iPhone was as
great when it launched as the iPhone 10
this is definitely a great smartphone
that'll turn heads no matter where you
go and that's very reliable overall is
it worth $1000 no especially when you've
got almost the same internals on a
different chassis with the iPhone
plus it's when you dilute the payments
into installments that I do agree with
my buddy David Cogan and that an extra
$6 a month for all this makes the
decision a little more compelling the
iPhone 10 may not be the best smartphone
of 2017 but it is ahead of the curve in
a couple of things it is definitely the
coolest iPhone ever made and also one of
the coolest phones I've used in 2017
hands down and if you'd like to make
this fingerprint magnet of an iPhone 10
even cooler deeper and skins will
eliminate those fingerprints and add
some grip to your iPhone 10 or any
iPhone for that matter
