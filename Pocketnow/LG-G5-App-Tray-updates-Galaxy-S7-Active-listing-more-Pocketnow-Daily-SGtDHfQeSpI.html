got confirmed by the company LG has
second thoughts about the app tray
availability on the g5 and analysts
predict that the iphone 7s will be a
dramatic departure to what we know I'm
hi Mary vera and the major rule of thumb
is that if something isn't broken
somebody will figure out how to break it
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with Cassio probably
one of the products that I personally
like the most from CES 2016 was the
outdoor SmartWatch that they came up
with a new way to approach Android wear
with very cool applications that focus
exclusively on the outdoor experience
it's costing 500 bucks it's already
available on certain retailers but the
interesting part is that if you want
certain color options you'll have to
choose your retailer you could follow
the links to the description to learn
more about that so far the price tag is
not really that bad for what you're
getting I also the spotlight over to HTC
we are just a few weeks away from it's a
HTC 10 announcement and it seems that
there is not just one announcement
apparently there are three phones or at
least three variants of the same phone
one with a Snapdragon 650 to processor
three gigs of RAM another with a
Snapdragon 820 processor in three gigs
of RAM difference here is also storage
you got 16 gigs on the entry level and
then 32 gigs on this one and then there
is a full-blown 4 gigabyte Snapdragon
820 variant with 32 gigs of storage as
well it's interesting this would be the
first time that HTC approaches the
market with different variants but let's
just hope that these are compelling and
we have been covering a ton of rumors of
the Samsung Galaxy s7 active I know a
lot of people that are really looking
forward to this phone starting with me
and if you wondered if the leaks were
true the company just published their
level application for their audio
products on the Google Play Store and
within the compatibility list it's right
there you could just look for it in the
source links you'll notice that Samsung
Galaxy s7 active is being mentioned so
yeah the product is coming which is not
sure when and then when it comes to the
iphone 7 or iphone 7s we have heard that
the company is planning some major
design changes
one of them is the fact that apparently
glass on glass is returning for those of
you that don't like that design on the
Galaxy s7 or galaxy s6 or didn't like it
in the iphone 4 iphone 4s apparently
it's making a comeback though there are
rumors that it might be a ceramic back
we also hear that the plus variants
might get larger up to five point eight
inches in the diagonal and that the
AMOLED display is incoming with this
variant now again we're not sure if this
is for the iphone 7 the analysts are
saying 2017 which would mean iphone 7s
and this analyst does have a lot of
credibility and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with the LG g5
as there is this promo video for the
device teasing everything you can do
with it and there are some cool things
coming like for example new features
where you could take various collage
photos using all the cameras since
you've got three cameras on the phone
but in addition to that probably the
most controversial part was when they
show you how to re-enable the app tray
as apparently this will be a feature
that's now official not something that's
dug deep as it was discovered recently
from TK on xda-developers it is rather
interesting that LG is pulling back from
this mentality apparently there was a
lot of complaints over this but we'd
love to know in the comments down below
look at the full video until is what do
you think about the g5 are you compelled
to get one because I will admit I am I
cannot wait to get our review unit but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you think friends you know
the way it goes if we want to get these
news earlier before the video was filmed
although was I'm talking out on time and
hit that subscribe button down below for
more videos like this one now this you
can also follow us on vessel at vessel
calm / pocket now you can follow me on
Twitter I'm an underscore to be better
on Instagram at high Meadow iveta please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw i am here to be better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
