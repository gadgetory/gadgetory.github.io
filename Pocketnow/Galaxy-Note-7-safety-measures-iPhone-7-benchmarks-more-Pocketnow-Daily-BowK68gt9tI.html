other countries and even other measures
preliminary iphone 7 benchmarks show
some awesome performance and some sweet
deals make the huawei honor ate a great
purchase i'm high metal iveta and as
much as i debated the red text on this
t-shirt i just could not let it pass
this is parking out daily the official
loose today begin with deals those of
you in the market for a good smartphone
at four dollars and some very pricey
bluetooth headphones well no eggs got
this new deal for the Huawei honor 8
which continues to be one of our
favorite premium mid-range smartphones
of the year and we go for the phone in
addition to the fact that you're getting
a really sweet deal in the price tag you
also get a bundle JPL pair of headphones
that are wireless a price range of 125
bucks that is a really sweet deal i
highly suggest you follow the link in
the description other official news come
from apple as the company has just
unveiled its official versions of washoe
us three in addition to iOS 10 you're
gonna have to wait for mac OS c or a
little more the enhancements we pretty
much covered in a separate video for
both watch OS three ni OS 10 there is a
lot to talk about here and obviously we
will be reporting on which ones are the
useful ones and speaking of apple it's
very interesting to see t-mobile CEO
john leisure come on record to state
that apple has pretty much quadrupled
sales with the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus at
least on t-mobile which is great meaning
that yeah for those of you that were up
at 3am trying to preorder the phone like
I was this is the reason why I went so
bad and speaking of the iphone 7 for
those of you that are wondering just how
powerful is phone as remember previously
every 8 chip from Apple has a land that
great single core performance results
and to to us just publish some numbers
that show us that in the case of the
iphone 7 we get details on the RAM two
and three gigs of ram internally for
these phones and well some of these
benchmark scores even though synthetic
have beat devices like the galaxy s7
edge the one plus three and some of
these metrics even exceed what the
benchmark was testing yeah we cannot
wait to get our review
units to tell you more about that
because again these are just numbers not
necessarily how the phone performs and
finally some very interesting nooses
they have to do with the samsung galaxy
note 7 as we get three pieces of
information that are rather interesting
number one recalls have continued in the
United States and now extended to Canada
which is expected number two in
countries like Hong Kong there is a
website where you can add your imei in
the Samsung page and you can know if the
phone that you've got has battery
problems or not again if you're in that
area that does not work for phones in
the United States and number three the
most important one is that well Samsung
is apparently considering a software
update that will actually reduce your
ability to charge the Galaxy Note
seventh just sixty percent pretty much
forcing you to return the phone which
leads me to the question of the day why
haven't you returned your galaxy note 7
in your case in my case threes and wise
because I'm still waiting for notes
Evans I don't want a galaxy s7 but yes
my phone is powered off I'm waiting
