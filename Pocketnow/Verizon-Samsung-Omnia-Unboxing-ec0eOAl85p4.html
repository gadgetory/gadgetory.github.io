pocketnow.com i just received this
just-released verizon samsung omnia i900
Saugus Brandon our editor reviewed the
omnia i900 which is the GSM cousin of
this smartphone the verizon version the
i 910 is very similar in specification
but it is designed to work on verizon's
cdma ev-do 3g network an exciting
feature on this device is that it is
evdo rev a capable the problem is i'm
not sure what capable means is that that
verizon has implemented the feature or
that the i nine 10s hardware is capable
of the evdo rev a and we just need to
wait for a rom update i'll get to the
bottom of this as I review the device
let's start with the unboxing it's very
nice box there's a samsung logo that's
embossed on the top the device looks
pretty much identical to the i 900 we'll
put that aside for now underneath this
flap there is software and manuals
here's a stylist as with the i900 there
is no stylus holder on the device and
the stylus is telescoping this is a bit
of a weird arrangement let's see how it
works here we have a headphone adapter
the I 9-10 has an FM radio built in this
adapter looks like it allows you to plug
the USB cable and headphones at the same
time
then we have the charger which is a 110
240 volt travel charger then we have a
proprietary USB cable with the Samsung
plug last we have what looks to be a
headset adapter and it has a volume
button there and on the front it has a
call button probably to start and end
calls and funny thing there's no
headphones that come with it now we'll
look at the software the software
package we've got the verizon companion
CD the verizon access manager CD which
allows you to tether your laptop to the
evdo network we have a CD with the user
manual then we've got some consumer
literature from verizon and samsung a
what looks to be a quick start guide and
tips and hints and shortcuts put the
stuff back to the side here and let's
take a look at the device will peel off
the protective coating so it's a glossy
screen we've got a 5 megapixel camera on
the back and let's compare it to some
other devices like the verizon samsung
i760 which has a pullout keyboard
the AT&amp;amp;T tilt obviously the i 910 is
much sleeker but it has no pull out
keyboard like the tilt or the i760 an
older device we have here is my t-mobile
wing and that's t-mobile's only windows
mobile professional device right now
pretty sad comment and then we have the
iphone which is really what this device
is supposed to compete against other
both touch devices with very few
hardware keys the omnia is about the
same thickness but it's slightly smaller
the screen on the omnia is 3.2 inches
but with a 240 x 400 resolution it beats
the iphone the i 910 has 8 gigabytes of
storage as well as 256 megabytes of
flash and 128 megabytes of ram so that's
about it for the unboxing next up we'll
take a tour of the device and then see
what this device can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
