probable manufacturing delays a TMT
opens pre-orders for the Nokia Lumia
1020 and some lenders say that HP is now
working on an android smartphone or are
they I'm high memory beta and where I
come from the abbreviation of HP means
something else entirely but this is
PocketNow daily let's start off with
some product releases can you believe
this is the first time in history that a
Windows Phone is ready for free or just
a couple of days after being announced
so just the case of the Nokia Lumia 1020
which is the company's new flagship with
a 41 megapixel camera in the design of
the Nokia Lumia 920 etc etc it's a
beautiful phone everyone here at
PocketNow is waiting to get their hands
on one myself included and it's $300
after a two-year contract so links down
below to pre-order and let us know are
you getting one now let's talk about the
things that are not happening is we got
some leaked renders today that put the
internet on storm because this was an HP
smart phone running Android but we were
kind of expecting for this not to happen
the company just confirm that they're
not and the reason why is because I mean
we've got their Android tablet that
hasn't really taken off they're actually
two of you didn't know and well we just
know that they're not really succeeding
with it as they haven't succeeded what
the contract Ipek line of years ago we
needed a with the webOS platform so
really HP what are you up to lately now
let's talk about the sony onami the
leaks that have we've been hearing for
the last couple of days are pretty much
being confirmed now we are getting a
Snapdragon 800 we're getting a 20
megapixel camera with an interesting
sensor out there that we're still trying
to confirm but a second that we are also
getting a waterproof design just like
the Xperia Z and also a 3000 milliamp
hour battery yeah three thousand
milliamp hour battery that thing must be
huge so stay tuned this we're most
probably getting this phone and Aoife to
compete with the Galaxy Note 3 that's
gonna be interesting now let's talk
about the LG g2 or Optimus G 2 whatever
the company is gonna be calling this
phone apparently the battery's gonna be
20% bigger we're also getting three
gigabytes of RAM just like the rumors of
the Galaxy Note 3 but interesting we've
also got photos of the back of the phone
and a close-up now and
turns out that the funds at the back are
actually volume rockers but the question
is what is that button at the middle
take it guess leave us a comment down
below and finally for the interesting
news of the day it turns out that we get
some more leaked photos of the back
plate of the iPhone along with some
manufacturing details and it turns out
that apparently the company is working
on some sort of fingerprint scanner to
work with their display and apparently
the display is a new type of technology
being made by LG so as it turns out the
while they're having problems
manufacturing this new type of display
so it could be that we will be getting
low capacity when the iPhone 5s gets
launched but that's not the most
interesting part apparently the rest of
the phone is just a spec pump meaning a
little more RAM a little more gigahertz
on the processor the same a6 processor
so it turns out that this is not really
gonna be a hotter phone just the more
capable one so that means you see the
question of the day do you really want a
speck bumped iPhone with a fingerprint
scanner the fingerprint scanner thing is
not new it's been done before probably
not perfectly probably Apple will figure
it out but anyways leave us a comment
down below in my particular case I think
Apple should step their game up of
course is always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's a little mushy follow us
on target now comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well it also follow
me on twitter kind underscore Iveta
