and we're here with a new marketplace
application called length learner
translator now this is from same people
that brought you the link learner light
which is more of a listing of phrases
that you can translate between English
and a number of other languages the
difference between a program is firm
that program every every phrase was
translated by four experts / language
this one uses a more dynamic approach
and translation software on a server
somewhere no in the cloud but you can
type whatever kind of phrase you want so
by going here I can type whatever I want
here
and then I hit translate at the bottom
and you see it's translating it's going
over the internet to a server and
there's our translation appears at the
bottom and if you have the keyboard with
the control p you can press ctrl-c to
copy this text and then you know paste
it anywhere you want instant messenger
text message whatever but you can also
press this pronounce button and you can
hear that translation spoken to you
which is really nice really useful
here's our languages we can choose from
excuse me detect
there you go
that's a good number of languages now
one really awesome feature this are
there are more options there's
translation history this keeps a cache
of all your translations a certain
number of them actually I have it set to
10 right now which is the default and so
it saves the audio file and the
translations so that means if you know
don't want to use the internet or you're
off somewhere you can't use internet you
can save certain phrases that you know
you'll want to use as history and then
you can just load them up right here so
that's a really nice feature some of the
other settings
here you see you can now choose your
history and below the air you can boost
the volume to get now a louder voice
pronunciation which is good and you know
bars or restaurants this program is 499
on the windows mobile marketplace which
sounds like a really good deal to me a
couple other options does an easy swap
languages you can report incorrect
translations because this is not as
accurate as the wrangler nur light which
is you know used to teach you different
phrases so there you go really nice
translation program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
