iris scanner to some future iPhone
eventually Google Play family goes live
for all of you wanting to share and it
seems that the second-generation Apple
watch is right around the corner I'm
Jaime Rivera and I'm extremely curious
over what your daily driver is I'm
actually currently using the HTTP n it
was a comment down below this is pocket
out daily official news today begin with
deals if you are in the market for the
Huawei watch which continues to be my
favorite SmartWatch of choice it's
currently for $200 at B&amp;amp;H if you follow
a specific coupon code but that coupon
code is limited and the time is limited
as well so I highly suggest you hit the
link of the description other official
news come from moto I don't even know if
I should call it Motorola still but no
no the Lenovo company has just announced
that the Moto montz developer portal is
now available if you are interested in
building your own moto mods or something
that you're willing to sell this is
pretty much the time that's rather
interesting we wonder exactly what type
of moto mods we're gonna get going
forward mainly when the Moto Z is not
really that popular yet we'll see how
long that adoption takes and another
official news come from Google the
company has just announced that Google
Play family sharing is now available
during the household of up to six people
you will be able to share your
applications in addition to other media
and this is taken forever because you've
been able to share Apple applications
iOS applications for the longest time on
iTunes so yeah it's great to see that
Google finally reaches the bandwagon
obviously you have to share the same
credit card and a whole lot of other
things that won't make you want to share
this with your friends yeah as will the
spotlight over to the rumor mill for
those of you wondering exactly when
we're getting the next Apple watch and I
know there's probably just around 10 or
12 of you yeah it seems that Apple is
working on giving us the second
generation unit at the same time that
the next generation iPhone will be
announced and since the rumors are that
it will be announced in early September
we can expect that next generation Apple
watch we're just wondering if Apple is
going to make an early launch of that
product for an immediate one or if we're
actually going to have to wait another
six months now the rumors
that we're getting the same hardware
only better specifications so yeah
that's it and finally the very hot rumor
says they have to do with the iPhone
something because we're not exactly sure
what model it is there are a trusted
sources claiming that Apple is working
on Irish scanning but not the way we
currently have it with a separate lens
on the vices like the galaxy note 7
that's coming or on the Lumia lineup for
Microsoft how the Apple is working on
bringing this to the selfie camera
because the company obviously wants to
keep its minimalistic design and I
almost got stuck saying that but it's
minimalism with whatever we get on
iPhones but it's rather interesting
because obviously it becomes even
creepier no longer do you have a
separate lens that activates when you
are getting scanned this is pretty much
the selfie shooter which actually leads
me to the question of today do you
consider that the future like this would
be creepy where you know the iris
scanner pretty much resides on the
selfie camera you don't really know if
it's scanning you pretty much have no
way to hide you are telling the world
that you are using your phone in a
moment and that phone actually can track
you in every single way I know
technology is getting crazy leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion I don't like it
