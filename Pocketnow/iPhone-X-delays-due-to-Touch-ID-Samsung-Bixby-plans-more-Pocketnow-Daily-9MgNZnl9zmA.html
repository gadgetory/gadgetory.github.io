touch ID thing but the question now is
how the whole Vic speed voice arriving
to the United States it's actually more
complicated than we thought and iOS 11
beta changes continue to roll with
recent updates
I'm hi Natalie that I and hey Capcom
would it be cool with Marvel vs. DC
whatever come to Street Fighter this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for an Android wear SmartWatch the
Huawei watch 2 is currently for 269 on
eBay and sure that's only 35 bucks but
this is probably one of the best Android
wear options out there right now up to
the point where I've been using the
classic for a bit now and I really don't
want to change that so you can learn
more on a description other interesting
news have to do with Samson big speed
voice I mean we thought that that was
just rolling out and that was it in the
United States that was all you had to do
but now if you did not sign up for that
early access program you sadly don't get
Bixby Boise yet that's the way to test
the beta and obviously we do understand
that Samsung has taken a bit to roll
this out mainly because of some syntax
issues from what I heard so yeah it
seems that we'll have to wait a little
longer
now let's talk about imagination
technologies you've been following all
the drama of how ever since Apple pulled
and doesn't want to make their GPUs with
them anymore well the company's stock
plummeted up to the point where it is
now on sale and the question is who's
going to buy it as Apple tried to buy
the company a couple years ago the
company declined and as it turns out
this is the consequence of losing a big
customer like Apple so let's see what
happens in the future now let's talk
about iOS 11 beta 2 it just rolled out
to developers sadly the public beta is
not available yet changes are the fact
that control center now has the option
to be switched on and off Notification
Center has changed there are a couple of
updates that are actually very nice in
addition to the fact that iOS 11 now
supports the whole Maps Airport thing
even though it's slowly rolling out it's
going to take some time but yeah it's
quickly getting better and better over
time we'll keep you posted as we learn
more and finally the very interesting
news they have to do with the iPhone 8
and the fact
apparently it will be delayed at least
in its launch we do expect it to be
announced in September but we probably
won't be getting the device ten days
later really we're going to have to wait
until November because well that whole
touch ID on the display thing is
actually going to happen Apple has
decided to do this but there are three
technologies the company has not been
able to choose and obviously whatever
company chooses will it have to go into
mass production this could just push the
timeline a little further and it leads
me to the question of the day let's
assume that Apple launches an iPhone 7 s
iphone 7 s plus an iPhone 8 for $1000
and sure it'll be cool in whatever you
want innovation everything we can be
willing to wait for it or we just get
the current iPhone and now don't say
you're just going to buy an Android
phone or fine you could do that leave us
