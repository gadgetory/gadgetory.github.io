supplier start taking a hit Twitter
seems to have finally woken up and
smelled the coffee about its limitations
and that's all welcome Casio to the
Android wear arena I'm Emily betta and
don't you just love that smell of the
tradeshow walking for hours this is
pocket out daily folks our coverage of
CES 2016 begun a couple of days ago we
already have hands-on videos of letv
Huawei just to start it we've got a ton
more coverage coming up but when it
comes to the official news one of the
most interesting ones was oculus you
know that company that pretty much
started the whole stength of virtual
reality they've just made their consumer
products available for pre-order as of
today the only problem is you'll have to
pay $600 for that crazy thing and we
hope to get you some interesting
coverage of that product so far we think
it might be worth the money we'll keep
you posted as for other announcements of
CES 2016 one very interesting one was
casio the company has just surprised
those with a welcome to the SmartWatch
space that is now offering its new
Android wearable and that's focusing on
fitness on a more rugged product and it
actually doesn't look that bad and it
shouldn't because that thing is gonna
retail for crazy $500 and you can bet
that we are going to give it some pocket
out Fitness treatment in addition to
some hands-on coverage as well coming
very soon but speaking of virtual
reality one of the major players if not
the best is HTC with the vibe I actually
had an opportunity to test it yesterday
for the first time ever and I was blown
away it is crazy
great but there were some rumors that
the company was struggling economically
that it was gonna sell a facility in
order to be able to retain this project
and HTC CEO just came on record
yesterday to confirm that it won't that
the company is not selling off anything
that on the contrary it's pushing hard
with the vibe we cannot wait for you all
to test it out HD is making a big deal
out of it here and you should definitely
give it a try at some point and moving
the spotlight over to rumors one very
interesting one from trusted sources is
that apparently twitter is gonna
reinvent itself again and hear me out
here the company is trying to make
itself profitable somehow even though
it's not like if it's losing money
it wants the remain relevant up to the
point where it seems that the company is
going to get rid of the 140 character
limitation and now I have a little bit
of 10,000 characters I can't remember
when was it that I wrote so much I kind
of got used to the hundred forty it's a
great move we're just not exactly sure
when it'll happen
trusted sources claimed it'll happen in
March so stay tuned for that if you've
been wanting to get Twitter another try
and finally the very interesting rumors
of the day have to do with the iPhone
and isn't that weird we're at a trade
show right now and the ticket right now
is the iPhone but not in good news
apparently suppliers have received the
30 percent cut and orders from Apple
because it seems that the iPhone 6s is
stagnant seems that Apple is not selling
as much as it expected with this product
and they're taking a hit it seems that
analysts were right those were part of
the predictions that we heard for the
end of this half and then for early next
quarter but it leads me to the question
of the day you know if it's not the
iPhone that's selling like crazy that
what phone is what phone do you see on
the road most when you look at people
because I've seen a crazy amount of
people with new galaxies even though you
know the galaxy didn't sell that well
either leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know what phone do you see
most on the road as always you know the
drill if you want to get the most
