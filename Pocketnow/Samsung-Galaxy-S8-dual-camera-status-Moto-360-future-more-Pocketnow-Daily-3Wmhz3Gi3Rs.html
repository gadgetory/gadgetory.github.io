camera might not be too different to the
current one Lenovo claims that we might
have to wait longer for the next moto
360 and Spotify might be getting ready
for some major changes next year I'm
high memory better and yeah that was me
on candid tweet your videos at me I do
know that people have been deleting them
and that's not fair let's make this one
fair for next week
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals a very
extensive amount of deals microsoft has
just announced 12 days of them and
depending on the day is the deal you're
getting there will be deals for the
surface tablets there will be deals for
the HTC vive and the oculus rift and
there will also be some for more
affordable laptops you can learn more on
dates in the description of the
spotlight over two concerning news there
is the study that was recently conducted
to almost 400 different options that are
considered counterfeit for Apple
chargers on the web and according to
this 99% of those chargers were not able
to provide safe voltage for your iOS
devices or Mac's so just to give you an
idea if you're having issues with the
battery if the battery is not lasting
enough or if that charger is overheating
I would highly suggest you look at the
description learn which chargers these
are and kind of go for a switch and just
go for something official
now even though Spotify is my favorite
music service that does not mean that
the company is making money but not
really profitable according to some
internal sources apparently the company
is working on building profitability for
2017 in order to be applicable for an
IPO now that can be in a ton of things
definitely profitability means making
more money from users or figuring out
another scheme which could also include
letting go if people which I doubt the
company is going to do but yeah it seems
that we might find the price hike next
year prepare I don't even think that
that way I'd move away from Spotify and
for those of you in the market for the
next generation Moto 360 because you
probably don't want to buy the current
one because it doesn't have certain of
the features that Android wear to dotto
is going to provide even version
point-six well the problem is that
according to sources within Lenovo some
executives are claiming that it's not a
feasible market at least not enough for
the company to be building a new moto
360 every year so it seems that the next
SmartWatch might have to wait a little
probably late next year or early 2018
we'll see and finally the very hot news
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 and stream sources on Weibo that are
claiming that apparently we are not
getting dual cameras on the smartphone
it seems the Samsung wants to play it
safe they want to focus on design focus
on features and not gimmicks because
that is the major problem we have a
couple of dual camera options out there
that haven't really stuck I can't say
that I really use the dual cameras on
the iPhone 7 plus for example I do enjoy
the ones provided by LG but it leads me
to the question of the day do you think
that it's safe for Samsung to stay away
another year until 2018 or do you think
that it's the smartest thing to do
because in my case unless Samsung wants
to bring something innovative or unless
the company wants to go for the dual
camera wide-angle approach the LG's
providing I think that it's not a
problem for the company to wait up but
