in turn stands for something or someone
that's competent are skilled in a
particular activity this is the second
time that Huawei uses this moniker to
define the most advanced version of its
current flagship but only the first time
that it actually means something to brag
about
I'm gonna leave it out with pocket now
and this is our review of the Huawei p20
pro
the last month or so that I've spent
using the p20 Pro has proven to be one
of the most polarizing review periods
I've ever invested in a product in a
nutshell this phone has almost
everything I could ever want in a device
and also elements that I really don't
ferma hardware perspective this is one
of those phones that is really hard to
go unnoticed in public it is gorgeous
that's why I finish in our unit is as
unique as can get but also as reflective
and fingerprint prone as only a mother
could love with about the only positive
being that it deters fingerprints better
on the screen than its predecessors
you should also prepare to handle some
heft as the dimensions all lead to a
very commanding feel in the hand one of
its strong points at least on paper is
that this is one of the most powerful
phones that money can buy the new karin
970 powers the show with Siksika bytes
of ram 128 gigs of non expandable
storage dual-sim capabilities IP 68
water and dust resistance a massive 4000
milliamp hour battery fast charging
through huawei super charger though no
wireless charging capabilities even with
the glass finish this is even one of the
proud few smartphones to include an IR
blaster if that's still your thing now
where all the uniqueness ends is once
you power up the display and now I have
zero complaints about the 6.1 inch
AMOLED panel even if it maxes at Full HD
plus resolution I love the vibrance and
I also love how Huawei has tuned it to
adapt to ambient lighting my problem
really is the unoriginal 'ti of a notch
that doesn't really serve a purpose and
that is only made worse by the large
chin at the bottom regardless of the
placement of the fingerprint scanner if
anything I'll praise that even when
going fullscreen on video Huawei hides
the notch automatically even if you
choose to keep it active
now I've said it in the past I really
don't mind having a notch on a phone if
it means life with less bezels but the
biggest problem this phone had up until
a recent software update was really the
implementation one of the main reasons
we chose to take our time with this
review is because iam UI was clearly
half-baked when it came to this new
design approach I'm happy to report that
third-party applications like Instagram
are no longer blocked by the knotch and
Instagram stories now play well even if
you choose to hide the notch as well
which is fine it's still not perfect
though as famous apps like Spotify still
leave a huge gap at the bottom of the
application and you know stretching to
fit isn't always the best solution and
everything else Mui continues to be the
user interface you're either in love or
hate
I'm okay with it mainly because Huawei
has been quick to adopt Android 8.1 and
also given its Spartan animations and
fluidness tiny details like the
inclusion of the Google feed to the Left
content to be things that I find
convenient in addition to having the
fingerprint scanner double as a way to
navigate the user interface through
gestures each of you will decide if you
either keep it or make a jump to better
solutions like Nova Launcher have you
been using a p-series phone from huawei
prior to this one the b20 pro will feel
like a significant improvement trust me
on this and I'd even pick it over the
May 10 Pro this is the first B series to
include dual firing speakers that are
plenty loud for constant consumption in
the past I would even complain about the
call quality of previous P series phones
but that's also been addressed elements
like audio quality have also been
significantly improved though the lack
of a headphone jack just throws
everything down the drain previous
software versions that show some stutter
when using the phone here and there but
the latest build has this device
breezing through applications and
services and have plain graphics
intensive games as your thing this phone
will not disappoint you
and really it's not just the fact that
games will play well but really battery
life on this device is just epic
regardless of what you do I've been able
to push more than a day on a single
charge and then a huawei super charger
just takes care of the rest in less than
an hour now if you still haven't guessed
why this phone is called a pro let's
talk about these cameras I even decided
to do a separate video from Rome just
because the experience using this camera
was so unique this is one way in lake
his first triple camera solution where
we have a gigantic 101 7-inch 40
megapixel RGB sensor out of 1.8 aperture
a secondary 20 megapixel of monochrome
sensor at F 1.6 aperture I know I asked
if that wasn't enough there's also a
third 8 megapixel telephoto sensor at F
2.4 aperture also with the YS and trust
me there is no such thing as overkill
here sure you can take 40 megapixel
photos even in raw if you're using pro
mode but the cool part here is the pixel
bidding that provides a 10 megapixel
photo and thus allows more light in the
shot
this means that you'll get the obvious
great performance during the day but
also class-leading performance and
low-light monochrome sensor is there to
assist in things like dynamic range but
I'm a big fan of using it for
black-and-white photos as well as it
makes even the dullest of scenarios more
elegant while way makes huge claims of
its AI capabilities in my roam video I
complain about how aggressive it was and
not allowing me to easily switch it off
whenever I needed to unless I completely
turned it off which is something that I
don't necessarily always want but I'm
happy to report that after the recent
software update all that was fixed
essentials like portrait mode are also
very natural when using the primary
cameras and I love that you don't have
to step back to get a good shot and hey
fun fact given the size of the sensor
you sometimes don't even need to use
portrait mode as shallow depth of field
is pretty much provided by the hardware
the same goes for selfie photos with
this 24 megapixel sensor providing a ton
of versatility and where portrait mode
is
good for the most part and then I will
have to admit this is the first time
that I've ever trusted a phone for zoom
photography yes there is 3x optical zoom
but both the 5x hybrid zoom and the 10x
digital zoom solutions are also very
well were produced given the added
megapixels of the primary sensor
honestly from everything that I've
compared there's just no room for
comparison so what's the catch well this
feels like the Nikon of smartphones
where photography is amazing but you
won't feel that way about video it lags
behind in essentials like 4k video at 60
frames per second and if you do choose
to go for case the belies a ssin just
goes down the drain
there's also H dot 265 video here but it
seems that video editors don't really
support it as well as they support
solutions from Apple for example I
honestly do recommend that you stick to
1080p video where civilization is
actually really good
there's also ultra slow-mo options at
960 frames per second at 720p but even
that is really cumbersome and pretty
much useless as it'll film 10 seconds
and then it'll start processing the
video and not let you continue recording
the moment those of you wanting selfie
video make sure you switch off Beauty
mode and this will not only enable 1080p
video recording but also bring some
really good stabilization to the selfie
camera to conclude I think it's
important for us to clarify the most
essential reality of the huawei p20 Pro
it's the fact that it stands on a class
of its own I wouldn't even consider it
fair to compare it against any other
phone mainly because it stands miles
ahead when it comes to photography is
the Huawei B 20 pro the perfect
smartphone no but it's also not just an
iteration of the P series either I'd
call this a good version one of what the
future or smartphone photography should
be where the Google pixel 2 wins and
computational photography the beats when
he Pro wins and hardware man if only
wobbly could use some of the elements of
Google's software
then that's when I would call this the
perfect phone Huawei b20 Pro is
definitely a phone that I would
recommend you give a try
it completely changed my opinion over
the future of Huawei is a smart phone
brand and it paves the way to an amazing
future for the series but then again
remember I said the future at the moment
this is a really good phone but I
definitely feel that we need a version
two for this to be the perfect phone
