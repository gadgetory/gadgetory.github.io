Huawei is third in the market and its
media pet offerings for 2017 brought
some of the best speakers we had ever
heard for a tablet
fast forward to 2018 and there is the
media pad m5 to media pad m5 s I'm high
metal II that I would Jules Wang on
camera with pocket now reporting from
them WC 2018 and let's go hands on
brought to you by invisible shield
starting off with a smaller variant
we've got a strong metal unibody design
and the typical approach to tablets that
we're used to we have an eight point
four inch tablet with an IPS LCD at 2k
resolution 82% screen to body ratio and
there's I confort options in addition to
2.5 the glass in the design just like
last year's variant we have Harman
Kardon speakers now at the top and the
bottom both providing high res audio and
that's one thing that these tablets get
right as that's really what these
products are for media consumption the
fingerprint scanner that doubles as a
navigation button makes it come back and
it does bring a more recessed design
we're talking 32 and 64 gigs of storage
expandable with four gigs of RAM fast
charging capabilities that get this
tablet full in 1.9 hours which I
consider crazy larger media pad m5 Pro
doesn't really look like the smaller
variant the buttons into a vertical
tablet but much of the UI hence this
being a landscape tablet it sports a
10-point 8 inch IPS LCD at 2k and also
includes the same eye comfort options in
addition to 2.5 the glass the harbin
Kardon speakers are actually built at
the back we'll have to see just how well
these perform with their placement as we
review the tablets
what makes this a pro tablet is really
the PC mode snap on a keyboard and you
get a different user interface much like
the Huawei made 10 pro can though the
keyboard is not really included in the
box there's also an M pen with 4096
levels of sensitivity and even til
capabilities though we weren't able to
prove this at our hands-on experience 64
and 128 gigs of storage expandable are
included in addition to four gigs of ram
and the fast charging here is 2.9 hours
I consider that great as well oh and by
the way there are also Wi-Fi and LTE
variants for both let us know what you
think about these new huawei tablets and
how you feel about tablets in general in
the comments and while you're at that
