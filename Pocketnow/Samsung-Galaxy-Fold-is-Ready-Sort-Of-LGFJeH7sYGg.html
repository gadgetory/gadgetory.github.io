the changes we need for the Galaxy fold
but there's one tiny major catch in a
very odd move Tim Cook called a recent
article from The Wall Street Journal on
Johnny I've as absurd and the back and
forth continues as according to
government officials Huawei should
continue in the blacklist I'm Jaime
Rivera and yes it's Wednesday tomorrow
is fourth of July and for those of you
that have been asking for a major
giveaway keep it locked to our Instagram
tomorrow this is Parkin out daily the
official news today begin with deals one
of the things that I love is fourth of
July sales and truly if you're in the
market for Apple products one more time
$450 off for MacBooks if you follow the
case of Best Buy with their pre fourth
of July deals two hundred and fifty
dollars officer and iPad models we see
deals for Playstations and for so many
other products I'm not gonna bore you
with details you can learn more in the
description and in case you haven't
noticed and if you haven't then more
power to you but services like whatsapp
and Instagram and true the parent
company Facebook they're all having
issues right now and well if you've
noticed that either photos don't work or
they don't load or whatever the case and
obviously instagrams just come on record
stating that they're trying to figure
out what's going on I don't know man I
think that that's actually good we could
actually talk to each other you know to
our friends and not be on Instagram all
day which is what I noticed people doing
a lot but yeah that's just what
happening now let's talk about Apple in
the future of iPhones we've got a very
interesting twist over in rumor mill
happening regarding well touch ID its
return and why we had previous rumors
over the possibility of having such ID
all over the display in addition to face
ID but apparently no we're getting touch
ID back but for good in a way that will
drop the cost of iPhones for Asia so we
hear that probably face ID is going to
get ditched on certain iPhone models to
keep the price down and well you can
expect that to happen in China and other
countries in Asia
obviously we'll keep you posted as a
there's a possibility that it
cannot happen but apparently touch ID is
the one that's coming here to stay and
since we're talking about Apple let's
build the spotlight over - well a recent
article from The Wall Street Journal
regarding the departure of Johnny I've
and the reasons why and it's rather
interesting because rarely do you see if
company CEO come on
Twitter and say that the recent article
from The Wall Street Journal was absurd
and wasn't really on Twitter it happened
directly to NBC and obviously this has
been a huge story over the fact that
well the Wall Street Journal said that
Johnny I've departed because he was
having differences with Tim Cook over
the fact that Tim was only focused on
profits and there was no creativity
anymore - that Apple responded that's
absurd we've seen some awesome videos
from Renee Richie with product designers
the people that have worked at Apple
that are also calling it observed that
this is not part of the way the culture
works that we've known that Johnny ive
has been burned out for a bit obviously
this is a way for him to do something
different where Apple continues to be
the major customer let us know in the
comments what you think do you think
that he departed for some weird reason
or just because I mean it's been 30
years some people get bored and now how
about if we talk about Huawei obviously
I know a lot of you are waiting for the
company to be pulled out of the
blacklist
we had President Trump say that he was
gonna do it but as I reported yesterday
it's not that simple it hasn't really
happened yet and now apparently things
start to get complicated seems that
Huawei is still waiting for a nod to
continue buying US products which
include Android according to Reuters
Johnson Ehrman the deputy director of
the office of export enforcement just
said that Huawei is still in the
entities list and that should be treated
as blacklisted and we've got other US
senators claiming that this is the way
it should be so there is a lot of
back-and-forth it's not exactly sure how
long this is gonna take but obviously we
will keep you posted and finally the
hottest hoops that I have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy fold in its future as we
did not have concrete dates and I think
the news are actually gonna get a little
more complicated see Bloomberg just
reported that Samsung has already
finished redesigning the Galaxy fold
they stretched a protective film to wrap
around the whole display so it's
impossible to peel off by hand
they also redesigned the hinge it's now
flushed to the display which helps
stretch the film when you unfold the
device the redesign is complete but if
you're asking which is the catch turns
out that they are now in the final
stages of production for the commercial
variants but major components are barely
being shipped and now we're hearing that
we might not see the product until the
holidays which in the United States is
pretty much what November Thanksgiving
whatever the case may be let us know in
the comments I mean what do you think
what do you think that Samsung needs to
do for you to buy a Galaxy fold after
everything that's happened because in my
case I think that you know the price tag
if there is a drop in the price tag I'll
be like yeah why not because I love the
product for what it was when it had its
issues which I didn't have any so I
still feel that it's a great product
it's a great concept but I feel the
consumers will only adopt it if the
price is right leave us a comment down
