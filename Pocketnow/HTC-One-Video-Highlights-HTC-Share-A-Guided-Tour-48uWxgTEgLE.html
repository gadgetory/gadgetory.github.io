are weird but also awesome but without a
great way to share all that it's just a
big ugly pile of media so let's see what
HTC has to offer in that area I'm
Michael Fisher this is pocket now and
this is a guided tour of the gallery and
media sharing features on the HTC One so
let's say you've had a day full of
adventure in the woods and you want to
share it with friends this whole
experience starts in the gallery which
displays a ribbon of blinkfeed like
social images from your Facebook Flickr
and Dropbox accounts but your photos are
always right up top the one organizes
your gallery in two events by default
now the inclination if you're an
old-timer like me is to immediately go
up and change that to say albums instead
because that's what you're used to but
fight that impulse because events are
pretty logical they're grouped by date
and location and they're necessary for
video highlights as you scroll you'll
notice that the one selectively animates
events at random to show you what's
inside this helps liven up the gallery
instead of presenting you with the
static thumbnails we've been used to
seeing from computers for 20 years so
when you jump into the event you want to
share you'll notice a big square
dominating the top of the event now
that's not a video or a Zoe you shot
it's the video highlight reel the phone
has automatically created for you tap it
and you'll see something less than a
movie more than a slideshow setting
videos zoe's and photos to a jaunty tune
and throwing a filter over the top there
are six modes available each with its
own unique feel and we'll change it up
here to something a little more
appropriate some of them are pretty
tacky but it's pretty cool how HTC
changes the way the video is cut to
match the music
now as this scrolls through maybe we see
something we don't want included or we
remember something we do that's not here
we can jump into the menu hit select
content and then decide exactly what
media we do and don't want in the real
remember the phone is doing all the
editing and other heavy lifting here
we're just telling it what media we want
included once we've got everything
applied to our liking we can hit save to
save the finished highlight reel to the
phone or share to send it to our friends
or family right away you can share via
the usual channels in facebook email etc
or you can use HTC share which aims to
preserve the cinematic experience a bit
when you go this route it automatically
uploads not just the video highlights
reel but also other media in the same
event which is a little confusing of
course you can alter what's included and
what's not before uploading but we're
not sure why that's not a mandatory step
to prevent you from uploading things you
really didn't want to the UI could use a
little clarification here once the
upload is complete you decide how you
want to share the link to the experience
and you send it out your experience
stays hosted at the private link for a
hundred eighty days and it looks like
this on a computer screen the highlights
reel sometimes takes a few minutes to
load before it's accessible the
presentation is minimal and classy and
media is downloadable right from the
page we tested it on Firefox and Chrome
on a Mac as well as mobile safari on an
ipad 3 and iphone 4s and the stock
android browser on the HTC One the
highlights reel played equally well on
the mall it even played on an HP
TouchPad you can use HTC share to
disseminate in a more pedestrian fashion
too if you just wanted to distribute
photos say but it's much more fun when
you include the highlight reel and
what's really cool is the video
highlights and HTC share work together
to give Zoe a reason to exist instead of
just being a collection of four second
videos or whatever and it does end up
being worth it just be mindful that you
do need an HTC account which is free
that content expires after 180 days
which is sad and that it's a pretty
bare-bones you I with the exception of
the custom frames and filters for photos
there's very little customization
available so you have to trust the phone
software to make your day look good
fortunately it seems adept at that those
photo frames and filters are great and
the addition of Zoey really puts it over
the top if you can resist the urge to
treat HTC's new gallery is just another
thumbnail collection you can really make
your adventures pop on the one just make
sure to keep an eye on your HTC accounts
storage space that's it for now folks we
