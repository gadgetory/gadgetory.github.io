pixel 3 in we don't see any not just
anywhere Samsung is launching a device
with 4 cameras in this October and no
it's not the galaxy s 10 and speaking of
the Galaxy S it looks like if it will
pack 5 cameras instead of 4 I'm Jaime
Rivera packing up sadly have to go still
in the gloomy hotel room this is parking
out daily powered by qualcomm the
official news today began with deals
google is pushing its one services very
hard lately up to the point where i'm
still confused over the difference
between android you know google won and
whatever other offerings it has but if
you're interested currently there is a
10% coupon it will serve you for the
google store and depending on what you
buy let's say buy a couple of things
that's a percent coupon will only apply
to the most expensive product so yeah
we're close to pixels so that's probably
a good time to keep the deals deep last
until September 28th now let's talk
about the razor phone too as we've got
some leaked images of wood to expect for
the new gaming smartphone and I guess
what we can expect this pretty much the
same design according to the images that
we've seen it doesn't really change much
in the aspect that we have already known
whether this is good or bad let us know
in the comments I personally use the
razor phone for a bit didn't like the
design that much it is just too sharp on
the corners now let's talk about Samsung
as well every single company is sending
out press invitations to happen between
end of September and October we've got
one for October 11th for Samsung and it
teases four times the fun now exactly
what four times the fun are we gonna get
at this event we don't know exactly
we've heard the rumours of camera camera
camera so we're assuming this has to do
with cameras so stay tuned for that or a
smartphone with a ton of cameras and
speaking of cameras know that device
that we just talked about is apparently
not the galaxy s 10 we've got some
trusted sources that the galaxy s 10
continues for early next year along with
the possible note and we're hearing five
cameras now now the rumors in the past
were for one in the front three in the
back now we're hearing two at the front
three in the back and apparently those
two cameras at the front will be the
differentiator of one of these
particular units so yes they tuned us
gonna run out of space for lenses at
some point it seems and finally the
hottest news today I have to do with the
Google pixel three pixel three excel we
are gearing up for the event that's
happening on October 9th everything
looks fine but the company just finally
sent out teasers for what to expect and
the most interesting part is that all we
see is the frame of a phone well in the
teaser if you go to the website it just
says a3 but there's another one where
they show off a frame that we're
assuming is of a smartphone that G at
the bottom and the most interesting part
is that there is no not on this frame so
whether we were I don't know played with
when it comes to the rumors that we've
seen a possible humongous knotch is hard
yet to be known but let us know the
comments down below what do you think
are you expecting a phone without a you
know without an entre do you think that
we are getting that because in my case
at this point it's kind of hard to
predict but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
then you know that the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 mobile platform along
with the audrina 630 GPU power more than
135 smartphone designs around the world
there's actually a reason why smartphone
manufacturers prefer it we spent most of
2018 praising its performance battery
life and data speeds this power combo
has won every single smartphone
comparison that we've run this year
making it a key essential in the next
smartphone you should consider hit the

why the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile
platform is so cool
