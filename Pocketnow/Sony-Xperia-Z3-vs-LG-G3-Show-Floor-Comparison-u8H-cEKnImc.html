their name but they don't have much else
at all in common this is michael fisher
with pocket now and this is a quick show
floor comparison of the sony xperia z3
and the LG g3
maybe that's an exaggeration these
phones do have software in common a late
version of Android painted over with a
thick manufacturers skin in each case
but on the hardware well the ones a
stark glass rectangle and the others of
polycarbonate air foil and the
differences expand from there the z3 is
water and dust resistant where the g3 is
not but the g3 has a removable battery
while Sony's is sealed in the 13
megapixel camera on the g3 is of a lower
resolution than the 20 megapixel shooter
on the Sony but LG's stabilization is
hardware-based while Sony's is not sony
does have a dedicated hardware camera
key though and speaking of keys
LG's got the patented rear buttons while
Sony keeps it conventional of course the
biggest difference on hardware is the
display they're both IPS LCD s but on
the LG it's super high density quad HD
whereas the smaller Sony screen makes do
with 1080p Sony's can get much brighter
as a result and the front firing
speakers flanking it are a more welcome
sight than the g3 s single rear-facing
driver if that all sounds like a mixed
bag well yeah these are two flagship
springing to different philosophies for
everything from manufacturing to
multitasking there are lots of
differences but is one particularly
better than the other that depends on
what kind of user you are and that's a
question we'll explore further in a
proper comparison and review coming soon
at pocket now to make sure you don't
miss it follow us on all social channels
and stay tuned for a lot more here at
the 2014 until next time this has been
michael fisher with taylor martin for
pocket now from Berlin we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
