pocketnow.com and today we're gonna take
a closer look at the hardware and
software of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
for Verizon which also has the 4G LTE
service so sit back relax and enjoy the
show
now we went over most of the specs in
the unboxing so just as a recap this is
a 10.1 inch display
it's got 1280 by 800 as far as the
resolution goes it's got a seven
thousand milliamp hour battery the
standby time is supposed to be
approximately 400 hours and the
continuous use time is supposed to be
about 12 hours I found that as far as
the battery life goes that it's actually
pretty decent unless you've got an app
like touchdown running on it which I
happen to do and really I found that as
long as you don't have an app that's
continually accessing the internet or
doing a lot of push messaging or a lot
of notification alarms that sort of
thing then the battery life lasts quite
a bit of time although we'll get into a
more of a comparison with some other you
know another more popular tablet in the
next video so I've been pretty pleased
with the battery life on the 10.1 Galaxy
Tab from Verizon no complaints there it
lasted me quite a bit through a very
heavy convention weekend I didn't have
to charge it hardly at all which was
fantastic even with the 4G service
turned on and not being toggled on and
off that was probably the most important
thing to note there as far as the size
goes and weight goes this is a very
light unit pound in a corner is what the
pr material says and as far as depth
goes it's really very quite very very
thin 0.3 4 inches then some of the
things that bother me about this device
or it cause me issues about device are
the same things that can happen with and
let's say an ipad namely the connector
here is not a standard USB connector and
so there were times that I found myself
upstairs and I'm
to get either charge the cable with the
cable and I had to go back downstairs to
get it or I wanted to do a data transfer
and had to go get the cable from
upstairs and bring it downstairs in
order to be able to access what I wanted
to the other problem that I've run into
with this device is the power button
sits right here and when you're holding
a device like this in your hand
I have tendency to rest my finger here
on this side which is right next to the
power button and right after we unbox
the device I was using it and I had a
good hold on it like this and I was
trying to type with this hand while
holding onto it with the other hand and
actually powered off the device
accidentally because the power block
like this comes up right here in the
middle which happens to coincide exactly
where the keyboard sits so I was typing
along the power box came up and I hit
the power off button and the device
immediately shut off much to my chagrin
volume rocker doesn't seem to cause any
problems it does have the ability to
mute and unmute by simply tapping on the
screen once you bring it up if you're
looking at the quickness of the device
it's actually very fast the the
animations here between the screens it
are slow but if the animations were fast
they wouldn't look as good but if you go
into a application say like decohere or
however it sounds pronounced and you tap
through pages I've got the animations
turned off in this case it navigates
very very quickly back and forth as fast
as I would expect it to anyway some of
the apps on this device haven't been
optimized or don't give you the ability
to turn off that animation and so they
run really really slowly when they're
doing their animation because I and
again I don't think that's necessarily a
part of the the processor because this
this dual-core processor is it seems to
be be able to handle itself very well
it's just the I think it has more to do
with the Android developers and
perhaps even honeycomb not being really
ready for super primetime or rather not
ready for the average consumer to be
extremely happy with it and to that end
I would have to say that really what I
found is that this feels a lot like the
original iPad and insofar as there's not
a whole lot of apps that are
specifically for the device that seem
optimized device there are device there
are applications that are full screen
but each of them kind of do their own
thing sometimes the the menu button is
down here sometimes it's used up in this
corner it does never seem to be a whole
lot of real consistency between the
layout and the configuration that said
it's growing every day and every day
that I've used this device it has been
getting better but again there's been
times that I have thought to myself oh I
should just go grab my iPad and use it
instead of this device because I know
how to work that sort of functionality
on the iPad versus the Galaxy Tab screen
is bright and brilliant I've got it set
to auto right now but you should have
the brightness all the way it's
fantastic the colors look great even in
a reasonable amount of light it's still
pretty easy to see although with the
direct sunlight
there's you know with any tablet at
these days it's still going to be
difficult sound volume is actually
pretty decent
coming out of the device it's it's
actually pretty good considering the the
dual speakers here cameras on the other
hand are just okay but again this is not
something I'm particularly concerned
about because I'm not using the cameras
to take photos or rather not taking
using the camera to take photos of
things I'm going to try to keep for a
long period of time if I want to capture
let's say through Evernote a image to
reference later then that's great to
have that rear-facing camera but
really like when I found as the video
content is not all that fantastic on
either nor is the single image capture
Skype does not work with video on this
device yet it's unfortunate that I was
able to get Netflix running on this
without any problem the the facebook
messenger service seems to run just fine
most apps run great speaking of apps and
specifically with honeycomb it's really
really nice the Google way the google
apps interact with the device in general
often times what I found with other
tablets is that the built end of
applications or the applications built
by the manufacturer don't really stand
up to what the third parties can offer
but I've found that a lot of the apps on
here specifically the Gmail the calendar
have a nice layout here and are easy to
manage easy to use same thing with the
calendar app I can find it nice layout
easy to view another thing that I've
understand is that this particular
device doesn't have the new Samsung
interface over the top of it which is
apparently calling it's causing some
people some grief but others have been
pretty happy with it I personally liked
the blue honeycomb kind of Traum look
which has been very pleasing to my eye
let's talk about speeds for a second
here nope wrong one my apologies as you
can see here smart bench only opened up
in a little window there and same thing
here with speed tests so let's go look
at the results so zoom in here a little
bit so starting up here when I was in
Seattle you can see that I was getting
about 7 Meg's up and about eight point
three Meg's down another test in the
similar location was
seven point eight and six up coming back
into 3G speeds area ghost drops right
back down to what you expect for 3G
speeds about 754 down and approximately
eight hundred four hundred and eighty
five up here the the latency times were
were kind of varied here is when I was
in Seattle these speeds up here the
latency times are really really low and
when I was in the Salem area in the
Willamette Valley south of Portland the
latency speeds would go up because
there's no 4G service available in this
area soon as you dropped into 4G service
it locked right in and worked great the
transfer between 3G and 4G as far as
Verizon has concerned is much better
than the Sprint transfers between 4G and
3G there wasn't as many hiccups along
the way and I found it really nice and
convenient to be able to access sites on
the go with this device on the road
especially when I was in Seattle and
looking up information we always it was
at PAX and you know able to use the
convention app and look up data and find
information move back and forth very
quickly through that data speeds were
weren't getting bogged down like some
other devices were at the same event one
other small hardware item of note the
fit and finish of this seems to be
pretty good other than a couple of spots
where things aren't quite right for
example right here if you push down that
the back kind of squishes and it sticks
a little bit there almost like it didn't
fully connect the edges are nice and
smooth it's very easy to hold on to
other than the power button item which I
mentioned headphone jack is in a an OK
spot but personally I would rather had
it on the bottom or the side rather than
having a cable run in front of your your
screen while you are trying to use the I
guess you could run around the back but
there's a lot of extra tension on the
cable to be wrapped around that side
the edges are clean and tight if you
push down on the screen it does bubble a
little bit you can kind of see that in
the video but not very well but that
said I did run this device naked the
whole time they've been using it and
there I have been able to get any
scratches on the screen or on the back
of the device course I haven't dropped
it but it's been very resilient to all
of the attempts to use it in
environments that have been somewhat
detrimental and just kind of throwing it
in my chrome bag and carrying it around
with other objects you know waiting for
it so use setting it down on tables and
you know backstage and not having any
problems with you know if you got moved
or bumped it didn't seem to have any
issues getting have any problems getting
bumped or damaged during that time so so
far it seems to be holding together very
well which I appreciate for this device
at five hundred twenty-nine dollars on a
two-year contract with the 4G service
that you have to subscribe to you know
this is you expect it to be the hardware
to be at least decent and hold together
for at least a reasonable amount of time
which is fantastic it doesn't seem to
have the same fit and finish as other
tablets which we'll get back to later in
the next review
as far as form factor is concerned I've
been very pleased with the sixteen by
nine layout and or you know more or less
sixteen by nine the widescreen format I
guess I should say and really the
viewing angles and that sort of thing
have been without problem really it's
been very nice format wise I found it's
a little odd when reading or looking at
this device vertically because it's so
long compared to other tablets but
really in this sort of format when
you're looking at a webpage it's been
very nice and convenient for scrolling
and being able to see an entire webpage
very very easily
you can see here the browser and able to
scroll very quickly without any problems
the animations and the flash sort of
content over here on the side is playing
just fine on all the PocketNow website
this is running on Wi-Fi at this moment
so the speeds are gonna be a little bit
faster obviously then it was running 3G
or 4G
putting
video contents make sure this see it's
taking a little two seconds to load up
but then it plays just as you expect in
a standard web browser on your PC or Mac
that wraps up our more in-depth view of
the hardware and software for the
Samsung 10.1 Galaxy Tab for Verizon if
you have any comments or questions or
like to hear some more information about
a particular feature or functionality of
this device please leave a comment below
and we'll try to cover that in the next
review which will actually be a
comparison between this device and the
iPad and the iPad 2 to kind of give an
overview of you know is this a device
that you should buy depending on you
know the type of person that you are
