and they bring some disappointing news
you've got an iPhone 10 camera lens
cracking out of the blue you're not
alone and benchmarks keep emerging of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 with
impressive specs for lucky regions I'm
Jaime Rivera and the only funny part
about Monday's is none of it was this
pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you are in the market for the Samsung
Galaxy S line or whatever galaxy you're
looking at the Best Buy has a sum of
these variants for up to $300 off these
are carrier variants AT&amp;amp;T band whatever
others think about it is you have to get
installment plans there is a catch you
can learn more about it in the
description other interesting news come
from trusted sources and Apple where we
hear two projects in the works project
star and and 84 and if this doesn't ring
a bell we hear two things that are
probably happening one of them being
that apparently there are more iOS
devices coming meaning more variants
apparently there's this tablet hybrid
which could follow on the news that
we've heard that you know Apple is going
to merge Mac OS with iOS at some point
and then the second rumor has to do with
that OLED display on every iPhone
apparently that is going to be the case
probably they found better pricing we'll
see as well the spotlight over to
Samsung as we hear that the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 is bringing some
interesting changes benchmarks show that
we're gonna get the six gigabytes of RAM
X and I was 9810 that we already see but
in watch a galaxy s 9 plus to a certain
degree but the cool part is the parent
Li certain regions are getting a naked
gabite variant that sports 512 gigs of
storage that is going to be interesting
I wonder why on just certain regions I
hope it's not just going to be in Korea
but time will tell now let's talk about
the iPhone 10 as we hear that certain
issues are happening to consumers where
you know you drop your phone and out of
the blue boom the camera lens breaks and
that's actually not something that's
just happening to you if that's been
your case apparently there are some
cases out there promise that Apple
hasn't really provided any official
information and repairs pretty much will
cost you the whole back of the iPhone
meaning 550 bucks if you don't have
Apple care 99 bucks if you do that's a
lot of money so buyers beware is
apparently the cases have even been
happening to people with cases yeah the
cases have been happening to people with
cases that's feathered weird but yeah
and finally for the terrifying news
today
oh man Google pixel three Google pixel
three Excel we've got leaks that claim
that apparently there is a reason why
there is not support on Android P god oh
god please no no no apparently these
phones are going to bring a knotch and
it has a reason not necessarily facial
recognition apparently there are two
cameras and what the purpose of that
selfie two camera module is going to be
as hard to tell as portrait selfies are
currently great as they are on pixels it
doesn't really make any sense but in
today's question let us know how do you
feel about Google now adopting the whole
notch mentality I mean in my case I feel
you know sad underwhelmed because I know
that there are better ways to design a
phone than this but this is just my
opinion leave us a comment down below
