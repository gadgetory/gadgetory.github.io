announced after mwc Android wear to auto
finally has a launch date or at least we
assume and it's this jeremy has a bolder
plan for the me mix I'm primarily that I
literally reporting from the middle of
nowhere where the hammock is real the
bird noise is real and it just breathe
in nature this is parking out daily if
it's a loose today begin with deals as
we actually were able to find one today
for those of you in the market or
Google's daydream VR there's currently
just forty nine dollars in the Google
store you can't really say that this is
our favorite approach to VR but
definitely her 49 bucks that's really a
compelling deal other very interesting
news have to do with the ZTE hawkeye we
thought that this was going to be a
slouch but it's actually not
specifications have a 5.5 inch 1080p
display in addition to three gigs of ram
32 gigs of storage and we hear of things
like I tracking for example in addition
to all the backs that we saw when we
were at CES this could definitely change
a lot of things we will keep you posted
as we see how the kickstarter campaign
goes now let's talk about shell me the
company made a big spotlight at CES and
we were able to see the knee mix finally
so those of you that are wondering why
we're not getting the phone it seems
that the company has boulder plans we
now see some benchmarks the show as a
shell mimi mix evo with a Snapdragon 835
processor so definitely it seems that
the company has other plans we will keep
you posted as we learn more for those of
you wondering when are we getting
Android wear to ATO we were able to see
it at the casio booth with its new
SmartWatch but the company even told us
they were announcing the watch until
April mainly because they were waiting
on something from google it turns out
that we've got some credible sources
claiming a possible launch on februari
night we expect that for the current
android wear smartwatches at least
hopefully we will keep you posted as we
learn more and finally the very hot
dishes they have to do with the samsung
galaxy s 8 we heard rumors that it was
going to be announced until after mwc
that we would probably only get a teaser
there it seems that that will be the
case tressa sources claimed that we
should be getting an announcement
somewhere probably new york city on
march 29th and a probable launch on
april fifteenth so
your calendars hopefully that will be
the case that we will definitely be
covering it live but it leads me to the
question of the day obviously by mwc we
will have the new HTC you ultra a
problem new LG g 6 in addition to that
me mix evo hopefully so will you still
be waiting for the galaxy s 8 in my case
after the case Rangers I definitely will
but leave us a comment down below we
look to know your opinion friends you
