pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
video of the LG incite on the AT&amp;amp;T
network this is LG's first smartphone in
the US and it's going to be going up
against the epics and the the fuse and
other new windows mobile phones that
have hit the AT&amp;amp;T network for the
holiday season so let's take a look to
slab device kind of like the omnia see
what we have on the box here
international multiband roaming email
capable gps camera phone specifications
alright well let's get inside the box
getting started guide take a look at the
phone in a minute here's the battery and
let's see how big the battery is it is
of size thirteen hundred million powers
good size for a phone like this here we
have what looks like the same little
dongle that comes on the samsung omnia I
hope this isn't the stylist yeah it is
the stylist which tells me that the
insight probably doesn't have a stylist
actually attached to the device you have
to carry this around which is kind of
annoying let's see what we have here we
have a charging cable and it looks like
it uses micro USB which is better than
nothing I mean it's not mini USB but
that's not it's not the best and here we
have the charging adapter and then we
have some software and what else we have
in the box here and just an accessories
guide okay so let's take a look at the
device and it's got a lot of plastic on
it so let me start by peeling some of
that off it feels kind of big in hand
it's got a really interesting shape
let's see what it says on the screen the
LG incite uses a LG quick access menu
see the setup guide see the online
tutorial things like that ok so let's
take off some of this blue
let's look at how it compares to other
devices like the omnia which is very
similar in terms of resolution and even
screen size in terms of thickness looks
like the insight is a little bit bigger
and let's look at the touch HD which of
course has a much much much larger
screen and is a little bit thinner as
well and let's look at the the epics
which I know a lot of people are looking
at right now on AT&amp;amp;T so it is not as
tall as the epics it's much smaller in
hand and it is probably about the same
thickness and let's look at the iphone
just to finish up the comparisons here
and a little thicker than the iphone so
my first impressions of the device is
that it feels high quality it looks
great it's a really interesting look for
windows mobile device and i look forward
to testing it more be sure to follow us
on twitter at twitter.com slash pocket
now tweets and we'll be back very soon
with a lot more coverage on the new LG
incite on the AT&amp;amp;T network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
