the hard time as forecasts continue to
drop
yes your Android Oreo update has just
rolled out for the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
Huawei just hinted that we should expect
the p20 with a couple of things that
we've seen in rumors I'm Jaime Marietta
and did you guys like the news early
this is a pre-recorded video to ensure
that you get the news early this is
PocketNow daily
let's begin today talking about Apple's
home pod we didn't think that this
product was going to be very popular we
still don't think it will be because of
its price tag but it's been surprising a
lot of people starting with the fact
that it's not as large as it seems in
photos it's actually significantly
smaller and people are claiming that it
performs great so let's see what happens
over time as a selling out as a good
thing for Apple now let's talk about
Huawei the company has a just sent out
press invitations for its event to have
it in Paris on March 27th the company
had pretty much already said this but
what's most important about the
invitation are the three circles behind
the Eiffel Tower which pretty much
confirmed that we are getting triple
lenses on this camera
what exactly is Huawei and like I going
to provide in this phone we are
extremely curious and we will keep you
posted
now we're gonna call this segment the
sad news of the day because well we just
heard a couple of things starting with
do you guys remember the Turing phone
and I don't blame you if you don't
because that phone pretty much was just
you know an idea that eventually I think
actually sold or I don't know because we
just lost track of it that company just
the clair bankruptcy that's the news and
then in the second portion you remember
Lee Koh and the fact that we actually
reviewed a few of its products it was an
interesting approach to Android that was
focused more on content consumption
well that company their website is down
right now and apparently their owner is
still dealing with the fact that he's
trying to find funding to keep the
company running crazy sad news as well
and believe it or not the Android Oreo
update for your Samsung Galaxy s8 and
Galaxy S P plus is now available
obviously there's a catch it depends on
your region if you're gonna get it
rolled out to you
now or eventually when and your carriers
and you know the way things go in the
United States the important part is that
it has finally left beta as we are just
a couple of weeks away from the galaxy
as nine finally NES in today's hottest
news today let's talk about the iPhone
10 not the 2018 model but the current
one as Goldman Sachs has already started
pulling its predictions and just
claiming that there won't be a super
cycle the phone has really disappointed
analysts and even Apple has a cut down
on its supply orders because the phone
just hasn't sold what the company was
expecting and you know it kind of makes
sense actually in today's question you
know let us know why do you think that
this phone has disappointed analysts so
much because in my case I think the
phone just hasn't sold because it's too
expensive people are just not willing to
pay the price of a MacBook for a phone
that is my opinion leave as yours in the
comments down below
