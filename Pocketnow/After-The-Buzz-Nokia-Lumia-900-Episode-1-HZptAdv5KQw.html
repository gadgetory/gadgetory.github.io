when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappeared
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of a review to see how
they feel after a couple weeks so let's
do something about it let's have a look
at a device when it's a couple weeks
after release and not shiny and new
anymore I'm Michael Fisher with
pocketnow.com this is the Nokia Lumia
900 and this is episode 1 up after the
buzz
so in reviews we try and cover the good
and bad but we don't always have enough
time to cover all the details we'd like
to and see how much of a big deal maybe
one of these issues is so let's see what
a couple weeks worth of marinating I've
done for our opinion in the Lumia 900
I've tried to use it as my daily driver
without using my Galaxy Nexus as a
crutch for about two weeks okay first up
is hardware now I've been rather gentle
with my Lumia 900 in the two weeks or so
been using it and that shows on the
whole the device holds up rather well to
long term use if you're not a contractor
carrying it around without a case on a
job site now I've had clean hands most
of the time as well so I haven't seen
much dirt or grime picked up by the
polycarbonate even on the cyan version
here one thing that hasn't held up all
that well though is that soft metal that
makes up the bezel surrounding the
camera and the most rough-and-tumble
action this phone is seen is going into
and out of pockets and sitting on some
tabletops and the metal though looks
like it was put through a clothes dryer
with a whole bunch of pocket change in
it the granite it's not too noticeable
unless you dwell on it and get it in the
exact right kind of light here but this
is only after two weeks I can't imagine
what this will look like after two
months it reminds me of the old easily
scratched iPods this is seriously gonna
hurt the resale value of this phone the
only other issue I had with the hardware
over the long term was that it hurt me
physically even though as I mentioned in
my last video I absolutely loved the
hardware design it really isn't all that
comfortable to hold for long periods and
it actually gave me a blister yes I'm
totally serious and here's the photo to
prove it the Lumia 900 gave me a blister
now the answer to that is of course to
go out and do more hard work or whatever
and maybe it's true that I've soft hands
but I thought it was hilarious I did
adapt to holding the device a different
way and switch to my left hand on
occasion but yeah it's the price you pay
for cutting edge
Wacka Wacka as for the display obviously
we're not working with an HD panel on
this device but in the time that I've
been using the phone as my primary
device it hasn't bothered me can you
tell the difference between this and say
the 1x absolutely but this is a
serviceable display at least and the
saturation and clear black are amazing
what about the software for a user of
many platforms how does Nokia's take on
the Windows Phone 7 platform hold up
after a few weeks really not bad at all
I touched on this in my 1x versus nokia
lumia video but Windows Phone 7
continues to be the most capable
underdog platform out there despite the
app gap I found most of the apps I
needed even specialty ones like Boston
area bus tracking applications and even
some games and specialty apps I grew
rather attached to that I couldn't find
on other platforms I am mildly concerned
about the amount of abandoned wear in
the marketplace but we'll just have to
see how that plays out the camera
continues to be the low point on this
device while photos an ample lighting
are ok too much lighting really
overwhelms the sensor and too little
lighting results in a ton of noise the
built-in software is simple but lacking
in features and the inconsistent
performance of the pocket 2 picture
feature that Adam Lane mentioned in his
review is a real annoyance other
annoyances like the sometimes scrolling
bug on Windows Phone can really get
under your skin as well and the anemic
16 gigs of memory doesn't allow me to
carry my music collection around with me
Windows Phone still has some
shortcomings there's concern about this
device not being upgradable to Windows 8
and the Metro UI isn't quite as fresh as
it used to be but we've talked about all
these things in other venues the
question I want to answer today is about
six weeks after the initial launch of
the Lumia 900 would I still recommend it
to an average user one of my friend
and expect him or her to be happy with
the device in short yes absolutely this
is a more than capable smartphone with
excellent performance on 18 T's Network
in the United States and I wouldn't be
worried about anyone coming after me for
my head for recommending this device
