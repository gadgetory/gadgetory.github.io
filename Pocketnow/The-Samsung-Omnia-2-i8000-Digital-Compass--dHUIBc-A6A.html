Paco calm and today I'm gonna show you a
new thing that I discovered on my
samsung omnia to which a lot of newer
devices are actually coming out with but
haven't really been implemented and
we'll go into that right now and it's
actually hidden inside the windows
folder so I'm gonna go into file
explorer and let's just go up real quick
and I'm actually going to the windows
folder we go all the way down to the l
ok so before this you'll actually want
you to select menu and click on the show
all files so that this program will come
up and the program is called LCD test so
i'm going to go into that right now and
it looks pretty basic i mean it just has
a couple of little test you can do you
can do that read and just put the cue
button back the green and the blue so
you can test all the pixels on your LCD
and also check the melody so right now
the device actually on silence if i
click on melody I'll start playing the
song go back select vibration will
actually go into a vibrating mode so it
will stay constant on I'm gonna skip
dimming right now because the whole
device will get really really dim and
going to make am and what that's going
to do is going to turn on the back
camera so we go on here as you can see
the the back camera is on and just go
click back and click on the CIF cam and
that's going to actually turn on the
front camera so as you can see that the
front cameras right there and there I am
so just close that and we can also click
on the touch and this is a neat little
application that allows you to see that
every access and every pixel on your
touchscreen is actually active so once
you've colored all these green just
going to do a real quick it's going to
say test okay there we go and it says a
touch test passed so that's good you can
also go on to the light sensor so it's
going to show you how powerful the light
is right now it's like a level 0 um
can't really take up too much light
right now but when you get more brighter
set but when you get into a brighter
setting it actually changes all the
little I think
10 no change show you the lux level as
well there we go to so click ok then
also a sleep mode which just shows that
the screen is off go back I'm going to
skip this one for a second the
accelerometer is actually pretty neat
here it'll show you all accesses so if
you want you can also change it so as
you can see the windows icon actually
changed positions with the x y&amp;amp;z axes so
just go back proximity sensor so this
will activate the proximity sensor on
the device so click here and proximity
sensors on the top of the device and
this is actually pretty neat because you
don't have to touch the device perhaps
in later builds on mobile devices you
won't even need to touch your device at
all like the screen you can just wave
your hand over and it will activate
certain programs so click done and then
Melanie melody received receiver so you
can actually hear it inside the receiver
just go back and the coolest feature
that I've noticed on this device which I
didn't know it actually had is the
compass so it has a digital compass and
as you can see because it is digital
some sort of interference from devices
you have to shake it a little bit kind
of like on a new iphone but it's a
digital compass so if you turn it it'll
actually pick up on magnetic north
through the digital compass inside of
the device so that's a really great
feature to have especially if your GPS
isn't working too great you can always
find your way and the last little thing
on this LCD test is actually the dimming
feature and when I go to that right now
and that just dims the screen so the LCD
test inside the samsung omnia to you is
actually pretty cool to check out a lot
of different features especially that
compass it actually leads me to wonder
how many other devices out there have a
digital compass that isn't active inside
the phones programs so I'm going to post
a directory on how to get to that
program in the samsung omnia two thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
