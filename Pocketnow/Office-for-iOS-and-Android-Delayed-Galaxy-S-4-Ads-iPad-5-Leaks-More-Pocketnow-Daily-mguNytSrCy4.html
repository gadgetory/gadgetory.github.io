some major delays the samsung galaxy s4
ad campaign has begun with some changes
in the ipad 5 will definitely have a
smaller bezel I'm hi meri behna and at
the time of recording of this video it
was tied to nil with an awesome game
this is out daily let's start
talking about t-mobile in their iphone 5
as they become really aggressive on how
to put the iphone 5 on their carrier now
they're offering you to waive their $99
down payment for the 16 gig iphone 5 if
you turn in your old iPhone 4s or iPhone
4 we just kind of really low for the
market value of a used iphone 4 for us
depending on how you treated your phone
but still I mean it's interesting to see
t-mobile doing absolutely everything
they can to put this device on their
network and then let's talk about Google
the company is giving away 21 Nexus
devices between Nexus 7's nexus for the
Nexus tens and even some google play
store gift cards if you hear this if you
follow the google play store on twitter
not gonna Plus Twitter just how bad does
Google have to admit that their Google+
has not taken off then to ask you to
follow their services on other social
networks which you probably already did
and also give you away something now
let's talk about Samson as their samsung
galaxy s4 ad campaign has taken off and
interesting enough they change their
strategy in the past they were mocking
iphone customers for making Lawrence for
their iPhone showing you that the galaxy
s3 was the next best thing but now
they're actually showing you that the
galaxy s4 is disappeared the vice
they're actually showing you what is the
vice is capable of at these new ads sort
of like I Fonuts in some way but still
obviously the galaxy s4 does provide
more added features than any iPhone
that's ever existed so these ads are
kind of interesting very good and I like
to see the fact that Samsung is actually
not trying to complete this time they're
trying to show you that their product is
better great now let's talk about the
ipad 5 those of you that we're wondering
what this device is going to look like
we already saw the leaked photos of the
ipad mini like device that's actually
bigger nine point seven inches as well
but now we finally have the first
display being leaked that it does have
the smaller bezel just like the ipad
mini so we can't expect this device to
look a lot like the ipad mini is
but obviously we still don't know what
Bates is going to be on because March is
already over and now we have April and
well the first generation iPad was
launched in April so let's see what
happens and finally for the setting
ironic news of the day those of you that
were waiting for Microsoft Office to
reach your iPad or Android tablet we've
got some bad news we were expecting it
to be launched in march but now there's
a road map that shows that it will
probably be launched in 2014 along with
the updates for the surface RT running
Windows RT obviously and just think
about it I mean Microsoft Office how
important has it been in the last couple
of years the tablets have been around
and well that leads you to the question
of the day are you waiting for Microsoft
Office the specific Microsoft Office
suite to reach your tablet in my
particular case honestly with Google
Docs of getting better and better each
time I've lost the need for microsoft
office in the last couple of years
obviously you cannot compare building a
spreadsheet on google docs to what it's
like to build it in Excel no there's
just no comparison Microsoft Excel is a
ton times better but still do you really
need it in your tablet leave us a
comment down below in my particular case
I don't need it on my tablet I do need
it on my computer but not my tablet so
let us know what you want of course for
an earlier school of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
moment she follow us on pocketnow.com
and subscribe to our youtube channel as
well please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi meri
behna thank you very much for watching
see you tomorrow let's hope we win the
game 99 bucks for the 16 gig iphone 5 if
you told in follow the google play store
on twitter think about it how more how
more the first time we have actual
display being available at best all
right and finally for the settings of
the bay those of you that we're waiting
for the eye to the Microsoft Surface RT
Windows RT version me and coolest come
on come on there's the specific
Microsoft Office suite even it could
probably be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
