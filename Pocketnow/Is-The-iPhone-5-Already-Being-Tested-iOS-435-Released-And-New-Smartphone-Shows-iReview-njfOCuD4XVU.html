iphone 5 make the scene Apple releases
iOS 4.3 25 minutes only for their
security and fictional make it to iOS 5
right now hello everybody I'm hi I'm
going to be vet and welcome to the
pocket now I ruin the show will go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with a cool so what's the week in Apple
news without rumors how well we have
current mug shots on the possible iphone
5 bean sets it in the field though the
ugly part here is that it looks a lot
like the iphone 3gs in the backing but
let's hope apple doesn't bring back that
old by six the device look like last
decade and they stick with aluminium or
some sort of curve class it seems that
apple will bring a device that's better
than the current generation iphone 4 ask
some sort of cases around in the market
already saying to the device will be
thinner but it does seem that apple will
make the device half an inch wider than
the current design which is really
interesting let's see what Apple brings
to the table because not everything is
nice a Korean telecoms already
mentioning that they're preparing for
the iphone 5 but it seems that they're
receiving 16 gigabyte and 32 gigabyte
models of the iPhone 5 and not the 32
and 64 gigs that we were waiting for
which means that Apple is probably going
to work either on a really dramatic
redesign on the device and probably say
that the storage wouldn't keep it prices
down or we need competitors to step
their game up and make apple bring more
storage to devices as competitors are
really not doing a good job in bringing
more storage in the iphone as right now
now one of the really cool features that
Apple brought 20 it's 10 line with space
detection to apps like photo booths but
the trumer that it'll come to iowa
scribe but nobody's getting them in the
betas and that includes the ipad 2
rumors have it that apple is working on
bringing a better front-facing camera to
the next generation iphone and that this
feature for face detection on photo
booth will only be available on the next
generation iphone
and probably the next generation ipad 3
now again these are just rumors too thin
again if Apple ever figures out how we
can unlock our devices with face
detection and not have it smash when it
looks at my face than hey I'm a buyer
now as a follow-up to last week's news
coverage where we were mentioning that
Apple was currently the largest
smartphone manufacturer by volume it's
being confirmed by a DC ABI and other
firms like strategy analytics that are
mentioning that the numbers are true
Apple is currently the largest
smartphone manufacturer both in volume
and in revenue how much revenue is that
will apple / two thirds of the profits
made by mobile companies only in last
quarter which is a lot of money but
aside from that you've heard those funny
news that currently Apple is making or
has more cash at hand then the US
government well it could be true and it
could give some ideas to certain
countries that are having economical
problems I mean make smartphones really
good smartphones as we get close to the
not-so-cool section some of you may be
happy to know that apple and AT&amp;amp;T have
dropped the iphone 3gs price to a little
more than nothing meaning a penny for an
iphone 3gs on a two-year contract now
what's the catch well first of all it's
a refurbished device it'll only give you
a 90-day warranty and you'll have
limited applecare and a cycling that you
can probably get some march somewhere
because apparently there are cosmetic
issues with the devices nothing confirm
go to an AT&amp;amp;T store and confirm that
yourself before you purchase but again
if you're gonna market for an iphone 3gs
and you really want one and you can't
wait for the next generation iphone to
be released and the iphone 4 to become
the cheap device then go ahead and buy
put these could be good news because
this could mean that Apple is prepping
to release a next-generation device or
it could mean that you just need to get
yourself an iphone now without any
excuses all right all right so before we
end our cool section we've got some
really good news for all of you we've
received a ton of requests for us to
release an eye review sort of video for
Android and Windows Phone and well as of
next week we're starting this project

android project and as a Thursday you

bad inside of Microsoft Windows Phone 7
platform also expect our I review the

you'll also be getting a windows phone 7
at roundup and also our android
application weekly all we good shows to
give you a full week of coverage of
everything that's good and bad inside
the world of all our smartphones
platforms as always remember feedback is
always welcome we always enjoyed so let
us know what you think about the shows
and always support us with your thumbs
up because those are the things that
allow us to continue bringing you these
videos will let us it for the coolest
continue on with the nap so cool and
well Apple is just 10 days after
releasing iOS 4.3 point 4 has released
version 4.3 point 5 to the media which
is for point-to-point 10 on verizon for
everybody that wants to upgrade their
iphone now remember this is only a
security fix update that's beneficial
for Apple if you still are on four point
three point three there's really no need
for you to upgrade if you want to
jailbreak your device and make it easy
on you stay on four point three point
three and if you want to have the latest
and greatest then well upgrade your
device as of now but that's pretty much
it only a security update that's why
it's not really cool there are really no
benefits for us and well rumors have it
that Apple will be using cheaper
materials asset the next generation
iphone 5 and ipad 3 to save money and
you'd wonder why would they want to save
money if they're already selling so much
isn't it supposed to be that the more
volume that's sold a cheaper that it
gets well it seems that apple and well
some images have been released out there
that have a sort of iphone
using probably pastic materials instead
of glass and we're still debating on
that because it does seem that Apple
will probably work on an anti-glare
screen for the next generation iphone
and not necessarily plastic now again
these are just rumors nothing that can
be confirmed just yet but we do hope
that Apple remembers that one of the
reasons why the iPhone 4 was so popular
was because it had really good materials
the construction design was fabulous and
we do hope that Apple doesn't lose their
legacy of good product manufacturing
over making money and competing with
competitors that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high Meadow remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw and stay
tuned for our next videos for Android
revolution and Windows Phone 7 v you
next week that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
