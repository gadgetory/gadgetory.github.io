shows as cases of the LCD iPhone in the
OLED iPhone 10 t-mobile Samsung Galaxy
unit seem to be sending your text
messages somewhere else and the powerful
honor GT was just announced and boy it's
looking great I'm high metal Iveta and
for all the spanish-speaking audience
sorry for the late upload yesterday of
packing down with the audio it took a
little bit longer than expected but it's
live we would really appreciate your
support
this is parking out daily
the official news today actually don't
begin with deals but we've been hearing
questions over the LGB 35 thank you
we were expecting a review unit LG well
I think everybody is nobody's really
gotten a review unit of this phone and
the still you can get it at B&amp;amp;H
pre-orders have begun $8.99 I consider
it to be expensive but it's wellspect
and hey I can't wait to either tell you
if it's worth it or not when we get a
unit let's talk about honor as the
company has just surprised us with
another variant of the honored 10 now
the GT variant with a better
specification same design pretty much 8
gigs of ram cameras are 16 and 24 24
megapixel selfie camera carry 970 and
the price tag is below 500 bucks it's
actually really cool you can learn more
in the description now for those of you
wondering when Apple is going to join
the fast charging era I'm not exactly
sure if the company is going to bundle
the new adapters that are being teased
but we've got a 15 watt an 18 watt
adapter being shown off with the USBC on
one end and then the u.s. connector
necessarily look like if it was an Apple
design but it doesn't look like Apple
design either whatever the case may be
Apple do us a favor
if you are not willing to add this into
the box just don't sell it now now for
those of you rocking a Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 s9 there's 9 Plus on t-mobile up
there is something going on that's kind
of creepy as well you know the t-mobile
is emerging from SMS to RCS the changes
in this technology were apparently
affecting the Samsung messaging
application where this guy recently just
reported that all of his messages were
forwarded to his girlfriend and I'm
happy for him if none of those messages
got him into any trouble apparently he's
not the only case and Samsung is already
looking into it you know buyers beware
and finally the hottest initiative they
have to do with the iPhone 9 believe it
or not we've been hearing that there are
three variants of the iPhone 10 in 2018
the larger the smaller and then also the
LCD variant but apparently that LCD
variant won't share the same name it
seems that it'll be called the iPhone 9
it will bring the single camera there
case renders already on video that show
us that there are some I don't know
minor differences when it comes to
external with the exception of the
camera obviously and unless you look at
the display but yeah iPhone nine let us
know in the comments what do you think
that you think that it's smart for Apple
to bring the name iPhone nine from the
middle and just go for it

to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news early or fuller
