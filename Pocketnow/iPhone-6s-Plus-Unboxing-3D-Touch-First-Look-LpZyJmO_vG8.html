and i'm pretty tired it's the end of a
really busy week we reviewed the Huawei
watch we took a first look at the new
Moto 360 and we finally published our
review of the oneplus 2 a phone that
doesn't awful lot for an awful lot less
than the new iPhone so while I'm excited
to see what Apple has in store
particularly since I'm in charge of
reviewing the big one I've also seen
what lesser companies can do for less
and so I'm holding the iPhone to an even
higher standard in 2015 before we get to
any of that though we've got to unbox it
so let's do that right off the bat we
see the box is typical Apple bigger than
usual because it's a plus sized iPhone
but only as big as it has to be no moto
X shoe box stuff going on here we got
the 16 gig Edition but that's because
we're cheap don't get a 16 gig iPhone
it's a bad idea it's not enough space
trust me okay let's stop stalling the
box comes out of the film the top comes
off of the box and the phone as expected
is waiting for us dead center underneath
is the stuff you won't read followed by
the stuff you'll use everyday and here
the bag is mixed yes the earpods are
here and they're beautifully presented
as always but the wall adapter is
standard it's not a super fast charging
solution like we've seen elsewhere and
the cord is super short as always
there's nothing really wrong here but
other phone manufacturers have been
stepping up their game in the inbox
inclusions and apples kind of just
maintaining then again it is an S here
speaking of which here's the phone
physically the iPhone 6s plus is damn
near identical to last year's six plus
which means it's huge
it Dwarfs almost every other phone on
our table save for the Nexus 6 fit and
finish is still tight as always and you
can see we've gone for the Silver
Edition here which also brings along a
white faceplate and 7000 series aluminum
a stronger metal which should help you
avoid bending your phone if you're an
idiot the cameras been upgraded but
that's all internal and everything else
is very familiar from the fingerprint
scanner to the antenna in
yay and Boo respectively powering the
phone on we're greeted by the same old
Apple welcome screen the usual array of
sign ends and sign offs and the new
cumbersome but probably smart pin
requirement will test most of the
software out later but the new task
switcher assures us we're in iOS 9 and
pressing a little harder on that glass
tells us that yes 3d touch is working
right out of the box it's not a long
press and though that input is still
here it's a forced touch with a less
creepy brand name just go a little
harder and boom the phone buzzes and
you've got yourself a context menu it
will check out the peep and pop
functions in the full review we're gonna
spend a lot of time on 3d touch I can
already tell this is gonna be the halo
feature of this s year device wait we're
done already yes we are it's just an
unboxing tell us what you want to see in
the full review folks when it comes
around it drop a comment below hit us up
on social media at PocketNow and find me
michael fisher at captain two phones

touching and thanks for watching we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
