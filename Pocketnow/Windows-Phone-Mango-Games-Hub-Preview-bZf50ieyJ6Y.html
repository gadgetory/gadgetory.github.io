and you're watching a windows phone
mango previous next let's look at the
games hub and here's our xbox live tile
and it's a little different there's a
little bit different design change here
and my little avatar still peaks in
there and here we go it's a lot faster a
lot faster loading the collection of
games and it's no longer big blocks big
live tiles that smaller icons now and
swipe over we got our avatar it's a
totally different design to white
background instead of the green and he's
fully animated now previously you had to
get the xbox live extras in order to get
this 3d stuff going on if your request
over here is friends and this is
actually loading avatars of my friends
it's not just a stock thumbnail there
and it changes every time where time I
go into the game hub so there's some
friends there online there's messages
there's my profile there's my
achievements all of this previously only
showed up if you have the xbox live
extras add in but now it's built right
right into the hub so I can look at
Antone
see his recent games prepare there's
just bio so let's see what games is very
good at so this is going to compare
achievements it's got a few that I don't
and we can compare
and it's going to gloat
so all that is built right into the xbox
live hub right now let's get back here
so those are profile Jurgis oddities but
one thing that is not built in is the
avatar editing so see this is going to
go oh and it's available now hey all
right well the xbox live extras beta for
windows phone mango just happened to
become available while I was recording
this video so I've downloaded it and now
let's see what happens when I have
avatar there we go and here we are this
is the avatar editor so kind of the same
as what you're used to with the windows
phone 7 we now have the marketplace
so there's all sorts of avatar
accessories and I can select them and
preview them or buy new ones so he's
going to try this one out it's briefcase
see what he does with it

on different clothes
that's pretty cool we can buy that let's
get back out here

been redesigned and this looks a lot
better we actually have graphics now

the webpage
