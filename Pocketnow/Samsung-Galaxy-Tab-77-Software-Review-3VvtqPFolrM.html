pocket now calm the Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 is running the TouchWiz interface
but on an EXO nose 1.4 gigahertz
processor super fast the same chip
that's found in the galaxy note how fast
is it in this video we're going to find
out let's get to it so the Galaxy Tab
7.7 is running pretty much the same
software that you will find on the
Galaxy Tab 8.9 and 10.1 we're on Android
3.2 which is of course honeycomb and as
most of you know honeycomb is quite slow
and quite horrible and you're going to
see a lot of examples of why it's slow
and why it's horrible even on this
device which has a 1.4 gigahertz Exynos
processor Ice Cream Sandwich cannot come
soon enough
the development community has still yet
to get Ice Cream Sandwich even on a beta
or alpha form on the Galaxy Tab 7.7 so
of course we've got the TouchWiz
interface here which has a variety of
widgets that you can add you can go up
here and press the plus button and add
more widgets there's a great example of
the slowness of honeycomb it took about
two seconds to access the widget tray
and yet if I go back in it now it'll
probably be much faster honeycomb is
inconsistently slow so here of course we
can flip through all the widgets that we
get in honeycomb and in TouchWiz get a
lot of lot of choices you can add and
remove home screens if you'd like and
add more which is a nice touch and let's
go back to the main screen and flip
around now just like the 8.9 and 10.1
samsung is added what I like to refer to
as quick apps so down here if we press
this up arrow
we'll get these applications that will
actually float on top of the application
that you're using I'll demonstrate but
to go into the weather application you
get this nice full screen display and
let's say I want to just bring up the
calculator calendar task manager any of
these things real quick so here's the
calculator app and I can use I can still
use the app behind the calculator as if
the calculator was kind of a stay on top
application and we can do that with
other apps as well so we'll go to that
little up arrow let's add the calendar
and you can only have one on at a time
you can also use these quick
to launch the full application so let's
go back in to say the calculator
application we'll click the up arrow
here and it will take you into the full
calculator application kind of a cool
use of the bottom bar here in honeycomb
which doesn't get much use otherwise so
you see what just happened I went back
to the home screen and the widgets took
about two seconds to load however if I
were to go back into an app and back to
the home screen the widgets are
inconsistently loading so that's just
again a a side effect of having
honeycomb another interesting thing that
Samsung lets you do is customize this
fourth key or this fourth button on the
bottom bar here so if I click on it
right now it's set to go right into
search kind of like an old-school
Android 2.3 effect a lot of Android
devices these days do not have the
search icon where you can configure that
as you go into settings here you go into
screen and it's called quick launch and
you can set it to one of four things you
can have it do a screen capture with
which is default for the eight point
nine ten point one and seven point seven
and then we can also do applications so
we'll launch your application tray
search or a quick way to launch the
camera so a really cool customization
feature there and we're going to go back
to the home screen now of course with
honeycomb we've got the honeycomb
application tray which is probably very
familiar to most people you can actually
edit the application tray here this is a
little Samsung touch we can move items
around reorder them so that you can have
the apps that use the most frequently up
at the top and let's go back to the home
screen
ok so let's jump into the web browser
and take a look at web browsing
performance which obviously is very
important in day-to-day operation see
how the 1.4 gigahertz Exynos processor
shines of course this is the honeycomb
browser so you're gonna expect honeycomb
performance that might be slightly
better because it's a 1.4 gigahertz
processor so we're going to jump to
pocketnow.com
let's see if we can go to the desktop
view first
so we'll actually go to the mobile site
and of course we can go up here and we
can do a few things we can print
although of course you can only print to
a samsung printer which is a little bit
ridiculous and we've got these standard
settings here
that is set up in a two pane grid that
set the home page you can do google
chrome sync which is nice so to keep all
your passwords up to date based on what
your browser preferences are and we can
clear cache clear history all of that
stuff and then there are a couple things
in labs really like the quick controls
you turn that on and what it will do it
will hide the top bar and give you a
full-screen browsing experience then you
can take your thumb and from the side
and you get all of these controls and
there are more controls than you would
experience on other Android devices so
what we can do here is we can go to the
URL bar we can go back we can go forward
we can refresh we can enter tab mode
really cool way to access tabs we can
stop add bookmark and go to settings
let's go to the full version of
pocketnow.com we'll test screen rotation
speed let's see how it looks as it's
loading a little a little stutter there
saw the page kind of load a little bit
slowly there it's not done yet let's
zoom in very smooth but as you can see
it's having trouble keeping up with the
page loads a lot of blank spots there
now that the page is completely loaded
it gets a little bit better but it's
still not as fluid as it should be with
such a nice processor so while it loads
we're gonna flip it into landscape no
screen animation because I have got the
screen animations turned off pretty
quick there let's go to a very long web
page let's go to any gadgets I'm gonna
go over here and go to the URL bar I'm
gonna type in end gadget and by the way
while we're on the keyboard I want to
talk about the options that you get
because Samsung adds in their own
keyboard options this is the standard
Samsung keyboard you can also press the
button in the upper left corner here to
get a taller keyboard kind of like the
smaller keyboard it's more conducive to
typing in portrait you can go into the
bottom right corner here tap on the
keyboard icon and change to swipe and
the cool thing about swipe is that it
brings you a smaller keyboard the same
size or kind of the same aspect that you
would get on a Samsung phone and you can
actually move the swipe keyboard to the
right or to the left which is really
cool if you go into landscape you can do
likewise so you can move it around on
the screen or there's actually button
too
bandit to fit the entire width of the
window so a lot of keyboard options on
the Galaxy Tab 7.7 which is quite great
so we're gonna go to engadget.com
let's switch back to the regular Samsung
keyboard just more practical and gadget
comm and press go let's open up another
tab to push it to the test here so we're
gonna go to say The Verge get some
graphic intense websites up here see how
the Galaxy Tab 7.7 handles it let's keep
it going let's go to Google ok there's
Google and now we have three tabs
loading we can switch between them with
this cool quick view let's go up to end
gadget and here is the website very long
web page a lot of graphics let's flick
down and see how it goes not the
smoothest thing in the world it gets the
job done but again honeycomb really
keeps it back if you were to put an Ice
Cream Sandwich ROM on this this browsing
experience would be immediately improved
another thing we should mention is that
we cannot figure out why the Galaxy Tab
7.7 has a speaker grille at the top very
strange in fact the Verizon version of
this does not have the speaker grille at
top when you play sound on this device
this sound comes out of the dual
speakers on the bottom here not out of
the top when there's a speaker grille on
the top it implies that it can be used
as a phone obviously you're not going to
hold the 7.7 to your head and use it as
a phone so we're wondering what has sam
sung has planned why they have a speaker
on the top there and it went into kind
of the inverse orientation so bottom
line with the software in the Galaxy Tab
7.7 is that it's held back by honeycomb
it's got the potential to be an amazing
tablet TouchWiz is a great interface of
the screen the Super AMOLED screen
really pops fantastic color fantastic
contrast but the speed issues of
honeycomb make this tablet difficult to
use at times
in fact at times I want to go back to
the Galaxy Tab 7 with Gingerbread on it
because that at least is consistently
quick so we can't wait for the Ice Cream
Sandwich update on the Galaxy Tab 7.7
keep an eye out for the final review on
pocketnow.com we'll put a link in the
description when that's ready
