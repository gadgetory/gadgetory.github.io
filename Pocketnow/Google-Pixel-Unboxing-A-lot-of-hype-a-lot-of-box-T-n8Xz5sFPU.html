receive is sent directly from Google so
you know what that means I'm how you
might be that it will it now and
let's unbox the Google pixel Google's
choice to make its own smartphone this
year has been a tad polarizing given how
the Nexus lineup is being killed so what
sets a tall order from the fan base on
what to expect from the pixel pulling
the box out of its packaging we're
greeted by thick white cardboard and a
pixel display taking half the design
elements we see the Google logo at the
top and the sides reveal your storage
options and services you can connect two
sliding from the side we have the inner
box that comes sealed and ripping the
tab off we have our brand new pixel to
the left
protected by matte plastic inside we
have the usual literature that's
complemented by a sim ejector tool and
below the box we have a USB to OTG cable
for the phone I was surprised to see two
wires on the right but one of these is
for USB see two regular USB making it
convenient to connect to today's
computers and fast chargers and the
other is for the same USB c2 USBC
connector that we saw last year with a
Nexus lineup which is pretty much the
only way to connect to the bundled
adapter now let's peel this plastic off
okay so first of all Google calls this
color option quite black and that's a
rather interesting way to describe it
mainly because depending on whatever
lighting conditions are hitting the
phone it'll either look black or more of
a tone of grey
I would even inclined to call this more
grey than black but again it depends on
what angle you're looking at it from I
could even swear that the gray tone
almost resembles the original Google
Nexus One probably darker though but
which is such a nice touch given how
Google and HTC collaborated with that
hardware as well
I'm also surprised at how this phone
feels small in the hand even with the
horrendous Chin's at the top and the
bottom I actually chose to go for the
small pixel this year because well I
carry two phones and since the large
phone phablet size was already taken by
the iPhone 7 plus the Google pixel is
actually going to complement that just
fine expect our separate Google pixel XL
coverage from Wan over the next coming
days so far I have to say this is a heck
of a way to make a great first
impression we've got more videos coming
