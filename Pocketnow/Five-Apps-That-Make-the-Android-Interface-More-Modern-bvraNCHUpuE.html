Android interface over the last couple
of years but there are new up-and-coming
platforms that implement gestures and
swipes that make navigating a little
more intuitive and fun I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and these are five ways you can make
Android look a little more modern Matias
Duarte
Google's director of Android user
experience has really worked his magic
on Android if you compare Android 2.3
Gingerbread with Ice Cream Sandwich or
jelly bean the differences are very
clear you have lock screen widgets which
were recently introduced in jelly bean
you also have a more refined
notification shade with gestures and
expanding notifications and even a quick
settings page and the entire interface
from the home screen to the deepest
settings menu looks refined and much
more cohesive but when you compare
Android to its toughest competitors the
up-and-coming mobile operating systems
such as Ubuntu phone OS or sailfish OS
or even BlackBerry 10 which all
implement gesture control and navigation
the Android experience could definitely
be improved less tapping more sliding
this is where these applications really
come into play the first of which is
called action launcher it was developed
by Chris Lacey the guy who created tweet
lanes one of the more popular Twitter
clients on Android and it completely
changes the way you use your homescreen
sure you can have up to five pages but
there is no more application drawer it
is replaced by the action launcher which
is accessed by a left-to-right swipe
from the left side of your home screen
an alphabetical list of every
application installed on your phone is
displayed and you can quickly scroll
through them by letter but that is only
the beginning of the changes of action
launcher it has a search bar at the top
of the screen which lets you quickly
access any of the applications as well
you also have quick access to Google
Play and also an action overflow button
on the top right corner there are also
folders but these folders are different
you can change them to a cover which is
essentially an icon that you can tap and
open an application or you can swipe
upwards and reveal the contents of the
folder it's a genius idea that works
really well if you don't like the look
of the folders its straightforward and
intuitive and I absolutely love the idea
of covers our friend Domenico deserves a
shout out for the second application he
showed it to us last week on pocket now
live and I've been in love with it ever
since its called
of box and basically it is the
experience you would get on Ubuntu phone
OS on Android a swipe from the side of
the display unveils a list of your
favorite applications which are
user-defined and it allows you to
quickly switch between applications it's
quick intuitive and I love it their
settings such as being able to change
the side of the display how sensitive it
is and other things and there's a
premium version as well
the free version works great although
there are some notable bugs next up is -
clock widget it's created by one of
Google's own and many have said that it
should be the default clock widget I
tend to agree it works just like any
other clock widget by giving you the
time but it also implements extensions
which can be downloaded from the Play
Store or they might be incorporated with
applications you already have installed
I have mine set up to show how many
unread tweets I have in Falcon Pro how
many unread emails I have how many
unread items there are impressed battery
whether any alarms or calendar
appointments I have coming up it's full
of features and there are more and more
applications being added to the list of
extensions by day without question the
widget I get asked about the most is
battery widget reborn it is a big
distinguishing widget that sits on your
home screen and pretty much everything
about the way it appears can be changed
its color can be altered its
transparency and its size it can be
resized down to one by one square or it
can be fullscreen you can also change
what happens when you tap the widget it
can take you to your battery info or the
built in settings for the application
there is also a notification shade
feature that shows you an estimated time
your battery has left how much time it
will take to charge you for phone is
plugged in and other information about
your battery the fifth and final
application that will make your Android
phone look a little more modern is
beautiful widgets it's not a new
application that's been in the Play
Store and very popular for a very long
time but level up studio recently
updated the application to adhere to the
Android design guidelines with that they
added an expanding notification and it's
what I found myself using all the time
for referencing whether slide down the
notification shade and you have a very
beautiful expanded notification they
took full advantage of that feature
tapping it also takes you to a full page
weather update of course these
applications are probably the tip of the
iceberg if you use different ones feel
free to share them in the comments below

up if you liked it and subscribe to the
