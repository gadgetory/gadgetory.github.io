over windows mobile 6.1 standard this
has a lot more new things than ones of
all pro one first thing you'll notice is
the today's screen this is a new default
you see the big clock at the top no
longer is there the series of recently
used programs as icons there on the row
below that you see bunch of icons and
some of them have numbers
if you scroll down to those it changes
to list text messages and it shows the
recently received text message there and
if I go to the right it also shows me
six new emails for that specific account
I go even more it shows no messages in
the MMS account nothing an Outlook no
missed calls no voicemails if I go down
well first of all we are up here you can
still read everything else so this is my
next appointment that's well down there
it shows it to me I can hit the action
button to open them I can also make a
new appointment from there going down
here's a get it's getting started item
if you're just open you're in your new
phone you can set up things breezily and
also has a media player integration so
you can press that and play music and
you can scroll through other songs also
notice the bottom soft keys are changing
so those are context-sensitive
can also ask access photos
and the last one is a Settings panel you
can change the profile you can access
the wireless manager change your
ringtone change background image and go
to the task manager this is a new thing
that's really nice a task manager let's
open that and it shows our tasks and
it's really easy to end them because
right here you see the end task is
assigned to the left stop key you can
also you press these over there or and
all tasks at once
send actors think
okay
um goes back home let's take a look at
text message
now it loads a threaded text message
window and I can type back
just said something
and here you see the window that shows
all your different conversations
fortunately it doesn't show contact
photos anymore
so that's kind of disappointment do you
can't mark it as unread so if you want
to reply later and want to mark it
that's unavailable now here's another
new thing down here you see slick
messages you have the option to choose
all below all or several disagree if you
want to delete things say that multiple
selection very nice
now let's go to the Start menu when I
press the Start menu it goes through
recent programs listing instead of the
all programs today you're normally used
to with Windows Mobile 6 I have to press
the left stop again to see all my
programs
ok so recent programs change around
these are all assignment or accessible
with the number pad so I can press 5 to
go to task manner I'm gonna press 3 and
go to the internet explorer see any 1 2
3
now this is a little different than the
windows mo pro version because you can
see the left's off he says amount
instead of back because we have a
hardware button for the back function so
let's open a web page
this is still the old slow denial or
mobile rendering engine
notice you can't zoom out while it's
renderings this is top there now it's
finished
Echo's zoom out and you can see I can
scroll real easily
all across this now notice it's in view
as desktop mode you still have your one
column fit to screen options those are
great so zooming out and scrolling is
really easy
I think this interface is it's better
than the Nokia version which will show a
little thumbnail in the corner that you
can see the zoomed out version and the
scrolling screen rectangle this way I
can manually zoom out and choose where I
lost Colton
so that's pretty nice
now here's another new feature in the
menu if I go 0 copy and paste first
option to select text so that brings us
to this window that just shows all the
text in the webpage now say I want to
select that I press the left soft key
and then I scroll down and whatever we
can now select all copy bears copy so
now I just copy that
and maybe I go back to messaging
and now look at this I can taste it
beautiful
so there's some excellent new features
and windows mobile 6.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
