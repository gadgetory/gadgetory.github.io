success with some really interesting
deals that won't last
iPhone 10 deliveries continue to shorten
now that we are far closer to the
holidays and Instagram keeps changing
now with hashtags and some other weird
things I'm Jaime Rivera pre recording
this video this face is 5 a.m. because I
need to get on a plane again this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for any Google devices this is probably
the best time to buy first of all
devices like the Google chromecast ultra
which is probably one of my favorite
devices is $15 off and we continue to
see places where the Google home Mini is
just 29 bucks I love that thing I can't
say okay you know what because it'll
activate itself here in the room but
it's really cool I highly recommend it
to you now let's talk about Instagram
for those of you that are annoyed at the
way the feed now works where it reminds
you of Facebook you don't have a
chronological order over what you get it
gets weirder I don't know if any of you
have ever followed hashtags or have ever
considered it but the new update now
allows you to choose a hashtag and put
it to your feed add it up as if it were
a profile that you are also following
whatever the point may be I'm gonna give
it a try today and let you know what I
think about it soon oh well now let's
talk about Android wear which Google has
totally abandoned lately for those of
you wondering when are you getting Oreo
for Android wear well you're getting
feature updates that will be a better to
version 2.0 there are actually some
devices that can already get this like
the LG watch sport in addition to
another list and then there is a larger
list of devices that will get it soon
you can learn about that list the link
in the description and how about if we
move the spotlight over to the iPhone 10
for those of you that want the cathode
device for the holidays it's getting
better
there are shipments that are improving
in both China and the United States in
the past there was a week of weight
right now it's being narrowed down to
four business days which kind of amounts
to a week depending on when you order
but it still makes sense for Apple to be
shortening the time and it does seem
that the company continues to improve
move it supply chain even as the company
continues to extend the markets where
it's available we'll see how things pan
out over the holidays for the company's
quarter results and finally the very hot
news today is the fact that oneplus is
turning 4 and the company is turning 4
on my birthdate on December 17 which is
probably the reason why the company has
been having such a great streak lately
and well we hear that the company is
giving out deals when it comes to its
accessories but there's also some
mystery surprise that if you order at a
specific time on December 14th you learn
more about that in the description
you'll get something that's different
that's new and I don't exactly know what
we're getting still it is great to see
the company celebrating for years and it
actually leads me to the question today
I mean what do you think about oneplus I
mean what is your top of mind of the
company I mean four years and literally
doing a great job at you know competing
with flagships I find to be awesome but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion as well friends
