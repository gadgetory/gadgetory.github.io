expensive on retail says analyst YouTube
creators green mixbit to tackle on
social video sharing and NVIDIA now
wants to build tablets for the masses
I'm high Nevada and trust me on video
what I need from you is a much slimmer
and Vidya shield this is barking out
daily let's start the day off with the
product releases google play music all
access the biggest name I've ever heard
in tech is now available for more
countries than just the United States
now nine more countries including some
in Europe Australia and others have now
access to the service and there
obviously is a sale for those that
register now until September 15th now
you know just next to wonder why Google
took so long to launch this when iTunes
matches everywhere and just about every
other service is but now let's be happy
now what an interesting twist the
YouTube creators got some Google venture
capital and have now decided to launch
this application called mix bed which is
an iOS application that will soon reach
Android ironically and the purpose is to
compete against vine and Instagram video
though you allow you to film a 16-second
small video and that's pretty much it
though you can actually stack these
videos up and make a one hour video
where you can't do that on Instagram or
vine but still a lot of us are still
debating if this you know video sharing
market does exist some of us have tried
on Instagram and it's kind of boring at
some point but still I mean these guys
create a YouTube and some people didn't
like it at the beginning and look what
that turned out to be so NVIDIA has been
all about Hardware lately but that's
mainly due to the flop of the Tegra 3
processor which people hated it did sell
that people hated it and since people
didn't trust the Tegra 4 anybody had to
launch their Nvidia shield which is
their game control that we're currently
reviewing and where there are not many
games that are compatible for it and
it's just the mixed bag of a product
that's really cool but could be so much
better and so now they're showcasing the
Tegra 5 processor to happen in 2014 and
apparently they'll be launching do
tablets there are going to be high-end
gaming tablets that are used this
processor in case they can't sell the
processor as well it's cool to have
confidence
it's cool to see nvidia push the bar but
really you know that Nvidia shield get
some more games or allow not necessarily
Tegra store games to work on that thing
yes they do but they're not compatible
with the controller it's just a mixed
thing now let's talk about the Sony
Honami we finally have a product name
that's gonna be called the xperia i1
since they ran out of the alphabet with
the Z and now they're going back but who
cares about the name that's gonna be
probably one of the hottest smartphones
of the year it's got a beautiful display
it's got a lot of monster specs like a
Snapdragon 800 processor but apparently
the best part is a 20 megapixel camera
and for those of you that don't know
Sony builds the best smartphone camera
sensors in the business the iphone uses
is the galaxy lineup uses this so
obviously there is a lot to be expected
from the spell in September fourth mark
your calendars we will be covering the
Sony event live in the inami will be
launched there I'm sorry xperia i1 right
and finally for the hot news of the day
those of you that were bummed out about
the fact that the preview of google
glass costs 1500 bucks trust me you were
not as disappointed and the people that
actually paid those $1,500 but still
according to analysts this product will
not retail at this amount of money they
made all the numbers on how much this
thing will cost and apparently once they
summed out the cost and everything this
product can not retail for more than
three hundred dollars when you think
about the fact that the product is good
but it's still not great enough to cost
as much as fifteen hundred dollars it
does make sense i mean it can't be
cheaper than regular glasses and it
can't be more expensive than your
smartphone so that leads me to the
question of the day if google glass
would retail for three hundred dollars
would you buy it in my particular case
honestly i'm waiting for google glass
too i don't like the fact that this
product is a parasite of your smartphone
in a way and i don't like the fact that
well you know a SmartWatch is actually
smarter than google glass because it's
kind of not practical yet i'm sure that
the next version of this product will be
amazing but sally version one is not
worth three hundred dollars for me just
yet but leave us a comment down below
what do you think of course it's always
for an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tell broke Machin follow us on talking
