intergalactic space travel strategy
games we have just the thing for you I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is our review about their out
there is a relatively new mobile game
for me close Studios set in the 22nd
century you are a lone Earth astronaut
who is just awoken from a chronic sleep
state in a far unknown corner of the
galaxy your mission is to explore and
survive the harsh environment by
travelling between stars and planets and
gathering resources oxygen for obvious
reasons iron to repair your ship's hull
and hydrogen to top off your fuel levels
you also collect other various materials
along the way and learn up to 20 new
technologies which help you along your
journey you encounter different
life-forms all of which speak in an
unknown language which you can slowly
learn some show interest in you others
don't along your journey you'll
encounter various random events which
sometimes present choices to you your
path in the game will change depending
on your answers which makes the game
more interesting and different each time
you play ultimately leading to three
different endings at first the game
comes off as a little overbearing as
many strategy style games can be we
recommend not skipping the tutorial once
you learn the basics though you'll find
it's extremely difficult to master this
game the controls are fairly simple the
green circle is the space folder the
area in which you can travel in any
given turn the blue circle is the range
of your telescope tap on any star to
learn more about it and to see how much
it will cost you and fuel and oxygen to
travel there within the solar system
view you can see more about the orbiting
planets and the star it will cost more
resources to travel to each different
planets are rich in different types of
materials probe planets for gases drill
for metals or land on planets with
breathable atmospheres to refill your
oxygen levels you will need to replenish
your ship's fuel and oxygen resources
and make repairs along the way use these
mind and gathered resources to build and
repair different technologies you learn
along the way or dismantle them to scrap
for more resources your ship can only
hold so many resources so you'll often
find yourself having to priority
dropping the less important items for
things which are more pertinent to your
survival fortunately you will sometimes
happen upon abandoned ships and random
solar systems before abandoning your
vessel you can bring all of your prized
possessions each time you play you will
have to try different things and adopt
new tactics to work your way through the
galaxy and seeing as the game is
randomly generated each time you play
you must rely on tactics skill and a
little bit of luck not memory to
progress further into the game each time
we haven't been able to put out there
down since we started playing the
combination of the mesmerizing
soundtrack and gorgeous pulp comic
graphics create truly captivating
gameplay out there has tons of replay
value and every time we play we seem to
find or learn something different about
the game like dozens of tiny random
events which will beam you and your ship
across the galaxy or ship wreckages that
you can risk exploring oh and did we
mention how incredibly difficult this
game is it even comes with a disclaimer
in the description fortunately it's not
impossible and we make it a little
further each time we play and all out
there is one of the most intriguing and
fun mobile games we've played in a long
time it's the perfect balance of
challenging fun and strategy it's
perfect for a quick fix in the waiting
room or hours from the couch at home
