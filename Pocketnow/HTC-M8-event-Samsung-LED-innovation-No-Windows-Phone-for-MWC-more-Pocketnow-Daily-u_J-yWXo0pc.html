to happen on March 25th Samsung plans to
revolutionize the LED flash with a new
invention it's teasing in rumors have it
that Windows Phone will be a no-show at
mwc I'm hi Mary lit up leaving from
barcelona tomorrow guys so the pocket
out daily will return until mwc is over
this is parking out daily let's start
the day off with more mwc teasers as
nokia has already sent their
presentations again to everybody and
this time we have this big green banner
with a big X so we know what we're
getting we're definitely getting the
nokia X at mwc from Nokia and we're just
hoping that this phone is as big as
they're making it seem because obviously
there's a lot of expectation on Nokia's
table right now obviously mwc is going
to be a big show floor for competitors
of Nokia now let's go through three
pieces of news for hcc first of all we
get a leak press render of the m8 and it
looks really interesting with this case
on top of it and speaking of the m8 it
seems that the company is going to make
us wait a full month after mwc to
announce it on the twenty-fifth of march
according to its press invitations as
either let that company has also
announced the program called HTC
advantage which is not the previous
phone pocket pc that we knew it's
actually this program where they replace
your screen if it's broken at least once
links in the description for a full
video from michael fisher explaining
what HTC advantages it's really
interesting now let's talk about Samsung
of your a galaxy note 3 owner and you're
really upset of samsung for blocking
third party accessories well the company
seems to have changed its mind
apparently now they're going to be
switching this fact they're going to
send out a software update it's going to
start with the European barians and
they're going to be allowing for this to
happen a second the fact that they're
also going to fix the bug where you
can't save a lot of stuff on your SD
card so it's great to see the samsang as
thinking twice as hey the business is
all ready to sell the phone what's with
the accessories now let's talk about
samsung again as we do know that we're
getting something with a 5 being
announced at mwc that the company is
also planning to revolutionize the LED
flash which i know a lot of you stay
away from when taking photographs
because it does make people look
annoying and so it seems that Samsung is
planning to bring us this new technology
that aside from being significantly
smaller
we'll also do a better job with
balancing color on people's skins so
that's great to see obviously we'll have
to give it a try and mwc seems to be the
spot and finally for the very sad and
disappointing news of the day we were
expecting for no kit to launch a ton of
windows phones at mwc and it turns out
that we've got some credible sources
stating that nokia is not going to
announce any windows phone as a matter
of fact no OEM is going to announce
anything that has to do with Windows
Phone and we are extremely concerned
about this I mean why is it that they're
not going to be using mwc which has been
the show floor for this historically
we're only assuming that Windows Phone
8.1 is again not ready which is really
sad so that leads me to the question of
the day how do you feel about Windows
song with this fact that we're not
getting any new hardware than the BC or
at least it's rumored to be in my
particular case I am extremely
disappointed and I really lose
expectations for something in the future
but leave us a comment down below hey I
could be wrong and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
