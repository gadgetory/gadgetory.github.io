we hear that it will borrow some
features from its own en it seems that
Apple engineers are already panicking
over missing deadlines for the iPhone 8
we get press invitations for the launch
of the LGB 38 Eva I'm Hilah even a happy
birthday to our newcomer Samuel and by
the way it's not me getting better at
jokes with the memes over at Facebook
and our page these are actually Samuels
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with watered down deals
mainly because I've never really
recommended Apple's back-to-school deals
and now even less if the company is no
longer giving you anything if you buy an
iPhone or if you buy any iPad actually
unless you buy an iPad or a Mac that's
the only way to get free beats
headphones and obviously it depends on
which product specifically you get you
can learn more in the description now if
we were to talk about good deals let's
talk about the LG G 6 and last year's LG
g5 you're in the market right now on
eBay trusted seller has the g6 for $400
if you want the g5 which is still a good
phone again the modularity something
you'll never use but that one is for
crazy $200 that is a lot of phone in
both cases for so little money you can
learn more in the description as well
and speaking of LG set your calendars
for August 31st one of the events that
we've been waiting for is actually going
to happen at Aoife and I just bought my
plane ticket we will be covering this
event live and yes LG is teasing that
this will be for the LGP 30 we see some
curves on the invitation device we see a
tall display as well so yeah it seems
that some of the rumors that we've seen
previously are actually going to happen
we cannot wait the lgbtq 20 was one of
the most powerful phones of last year it
was pretty much our favorite phone last
year I still use it for video and
vlogging so yeah can't wait to see what
we get with the V 30 and how about if we
talk about Apple mainly because
apparently the company is currently in
panic mode it seems that not only is
touch ID one of the features that is not
meeting deadlines when it comes to being
able to have it ready for manufacturing
apparently the company is also
scrambling with the wireless charging
and even the 3d facial recognition
feature that was opposed to
such ID in case such ID was not going to
be ready which is apparently the case so
they're in mind obviously I assume that
Apple has some sort of a plan B could be
the touch ID is just going to make it to
the back of the phone or something we'll
keep you posted as soon as we learn more
and finally the very hot news today has
to do with the Google pixel XL - oh yes
we've got some leaked renders of the
phone apparently these follow some of
the schematics that were leaked recently
and this is a very good-looking phone
nothing compared to the current Google
pixel Excel apparently we're getting at
all 2x1 display it seems that there is
some glass at the back protecting the
camera lens and that there will be no
camera humph as well
there is aluminum at the back apparently
there are some curves on the borders of
the display now one more interesting
part is that apparently we are getting
some sort of edge sense from HTC but it
just makes us wonder exactly who is
going to manufacture the spoon because
probably it will not be HTC apparently
the pixel XL - will be made by LG
regardless of whatever the case may be
the question today has to do with this
phone what do you think about the design
and do you think that edge sense is
something that you would want to see on
this phone because in my case I don't
care about its sense what I would care
is for that tall display on such a large
phone leave us a comment down below we
