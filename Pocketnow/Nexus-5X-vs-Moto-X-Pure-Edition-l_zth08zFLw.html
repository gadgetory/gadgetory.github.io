Moto X line have long been OS ease of
Tranquility for those who love Android
but don't necessarily love the bloat
occasionally forced upon it this year
the new Moto X and the smaller of the
two new necks I are separated in priced
by just 20 bucks making the choice
between them a tough one i'm michael
fisher with pocket now and we're here to
make that choice a little easier join us
for Nexus 5x versus Moto X pure edition
we're going to run this comparison a
little differently folks and tallying up
the Moto X as advantages first followed
by the Nexus 5 X's and if you're about
to suggest that maybe the Moto X would
be better compared with the Nexus 6p
despite their large price golf at that
point is well-taken and we'll get around
to it after the full review if there's
enough interest first let's talk about
screen quality each of these uses LCD as
the basis for its display but the motos
is a half inch larger and it brings a 22
percent higher pixel density this is
overkill if you ask me but there's no
denying that it's a fair bit sharper
when you get really close up and that
combined with its added saturation gives
the Moto X an edge here the pure Edition
also uses its display more intelligently
with moto display which is quickly and
reliably triggered by pulling the phone
from a pocket or just waving a hand over
Google's ambient display even after a
year's worth of development is still
much slower to appear and usually
requires physical motion to activate it
which is pretty disappointing if you're
used to Motorola's superior offering
Motorola's best-in-class customizability
has only gotten more elaborate with the
pure addition while the Nexus 5x only
comes in three paint jobs you can make
your Moto X look however you want by
juggling back colors front colors accent
colors even putting your name right on
the thing and if you want to spend a
little extra you can swap the stock
backplate for leather or wood the stock
trim and textured silicon with metal
accents feels very grippy and
substantial compared with the smooth
super lightweight polycarbonate of the
Nexus 5x and that added quality carries
over into other Hardware areas as well
Motorola's ribbed metal volume and power
controls versa
the Nexus is mushy indistinct keys and
the two big loud AC speakers on the Moto
X compared with LG's single unimpressive
driver while each of these phones is
built on a Snapdragon 808 processor
motorola gives it more breathing room
with half again as much RAM and a larger
internal storage option as well as
microSD expansion for those who prefer
the do-it-yourself upgrade path and
Motorola still has the edge in
contextual features here the after
mentioned moto display is faster and
more reliable the hands-free voice
control is more customizable the Moto X
can read your text messages to you while
you're driving and take dictation if you
want to reply and it uses some very
simple gestures to quickly launch apps
like the flashlight or the camera
speaking of the camera we basically have
a draw
why can't cameras ever be easy okay so
when it comes to stills generally
speaking the 5x is my preferred shooter
first of all the new Google camera app
is almost as easy to launch as the
Motorola's just double-click the power
key it doesn't always work but it
usually does the viewfinder is also more
straightforward and much easier to use
with one hand than the pure additions
and getting focus is often easier as a
result while each of these phones packs
a Sony sensor the Nexus 5x brings the
newer one boy does it show sometimes the
Nexus is capable of delivering much
cleaner crisper shots than the Moto X
and in extreme low-light the Nexus is
oversized pixels serve it well in ample
lighting predictably the differences
diminish and here the Moto gets a chance
to pull ahead with its added resolution
more pixels might not always mean higher
quality but for making sense out of
faraway objects with digital zoom you'll
appreciate the pure additions 21
megapixel sensor
but I still like the nexuses shots
better in natural light while its HDR
mode isn't quite as good at bringing
light to the shadows it's less prone to
artificially warm color reproduction in
the sunlight and it handles backlighting
better as well interestingly this
behavior reverses itself indoors under
incandescent lights at least here I tend
to prefer the Motorola output which is
more balanced and less likely to come
across as being filtered through a
sunset gel this holds true for selfies
too I prefer the Nexus 5 for outdoor
shots and the Moto X for indoor see what
I mean about things getting complicated
and as if that weren't complicated
enough in 1080p video everything gets
completely flipped around here the Moto
X is the star Motorola seems able to
deal with rapid changes in focus better
and it does a much better job at color
reproduction and dimmer outdoor scenes
note how the Nexus gives everything in
this shot an unattractive blue pallor
the Moto X is also intensely insanely
better at stabilizing video these videos
were taken with the phones in the same
hand held firmly together so they were
experiencing the same jostle from
footsteps but you wouldn't know it by
how much of the Nexus footage is jumping
around while the Motorola's is
Rocksteady and indoors under those
incandescent it's the same story as we
saw with the stills the Nexus paints
everything a little warmer than it
actually is
so to boil it down well you really can't
really the only two runaway wins here
are in video stabilization and low-light
photos those go to the Moto X and the
Nexus 5x respectively everything else is
kind of a crapshoot and which one you
favor will vary depending on your own
particular needs the Nexus 5x does have
a few clear advantages over the Moto X
and maybe it's no surprise that the
biggest one is in software the 5x is a
Nexus device so it's already running
Android marshmallow
while our Moto X pure edition is still
waiting for the upgrade from lollipop
now normally this wouldn't be a big deal
Moto X units have always followed quite
shortly after Nexus devices in the
upgrade hierarchy but recent
developments at the now Lenovo owned
Motorola have given
customers good reason to question the
company's devotion to updates if
unrestricted unqualified access to the
latest Android build is important to you
a Nexus will always be your best option
another win the Nexus enjoys is a
fingerprint scanner something we were
quite surprised Motorola didn't include
on its newest flagship like the Moto X
is distinctive dimple it serves as a
helpful anchor point for a fingertip but
on the Nexus it actually does something
it unlocks the phone very quickly it
might add and it also provides faster
and more convenient authentication than
a pin also while the Nexus is the
smaller device it makes better use of
the space it has by allowing a denser
icon distribution on its display this is
something we're hoping comes to the Moto
X with marshmallow because it's
ridiculous to have such a high res
display and yet be unable to make the
most of it and while we're talking about
size the more petite dimensions of the
Nexus aren't a disadvantage when it
comes to portability from pocket to palm
the 5x is a much easier device to wield
if you've got something else going on
and you only have one hand to spare the
Moto X almost always requires you to go
to hands-on and that with the Nexus it's
a bit easier to tell whether you even
need to bother reaching for your phone
unlike the Motorola it actually makes
use of its embedded notification light
just a couple straggling bits before we
wrap up there are aspects here we
weren't able to test like battery life
and call quality both because we were
using these phones on separate networks
and because both may change when the
Moto X does get marshmallow which should
be soon and while the Nexus uses a newer
charging standard in USB type-c the
availability of turbo charging for the
Moto X and the fact that USB type-c
support is still pretty rare it means
we're not going to give the point to
either of these phones
so what does it all boil down to which
phone is the right one for you oh this
is hugely difficult
I mean it's tougher than usual so I'm
going to resort to a subjective take and
then a balanced one so for me I'd prefer
the Moto X I'll tell you why I like
substantial phones that feel very well
made and I like being able to customize
my device to make it uniquely mine also
as much as I generally dismiss the big
super high-resolution displays and
expandable memory the fact remains that
these features are really nice to have
especially since you're not paying much
more at all to get them now maybe you're
different maybe you really value
one-handed usability lightweight and
blazing fast Android updates or maybe
you're just really into Android paid
really need that fingerprint scanner or
you like USB type-c because you like to
future-proof in that case the Nexus 5x
will be the better fit for you but just
remember that it's less a $379 phone
than a $429 one because it's 2015 and
Nexus or not no one should settle for 16
gigs for much more on the new NEX I and
the Moto X pure edition check out our
