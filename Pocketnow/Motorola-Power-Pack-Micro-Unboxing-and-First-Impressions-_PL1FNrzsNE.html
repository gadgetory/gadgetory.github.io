every smartphone needs more power
it's the Motorola power pack micro that
brings you an extra 1500 milliamp hours
just when you need it most we've covered
battery packs here at pocket now in the
past this one's kind of different it's
very very compact and it's got a micro
USB connector on it says it's a 1500
milliamp hour portable battery with up
to seven hours of additional talktime on
the Moto X up to ten more for the Galaxy
s5 and up to eight hours more on the HTC
One m8 just a quick walk around it's
supposed to be a very very fast recharge
as well so let's go ahead and get into
it and take a look we can get it out of
the packaging that's always the the most
challenging part of the unbox open it up
it just kind of slides out I got books
and who knows what falling out all over
the place open up the bottom part that's
where our singular cable is just a
standard microUSB relatively short nice
convenient go ahead and take that back
cover off oh I like this now comes in
what looks like two pieces has a little
lanyard holder on it which is nice and
down here that snaps on the bottom
you've got a single button on the side
and it looks like a status indicator
light little chirp there and a blink to
show you that it's working this feels
really kind of grippy almost a rubbery
but not quite so that's nice it's got
just a nice checkered feel to it walk
around that very nice you can take this
off again it just clips off clips on the
other side very securely I might add
that's where our charging port goes into
so all you need to do then is take that
plug it into the the bottom of your
device push the button and very quickly
you can get an
urgency recharge 1500 milliamp hours in
your pocket put it on your keychain it's
there when you need it make sure you
subscribe to our video channel and of
course follow us on your favorite social
media network for pocket now showing off
the latest and greatest for Motorola I'm
