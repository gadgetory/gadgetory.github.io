conditions don't always care about bezel
size chrome accents and chamfered edges
they want a phone that will work even
when it's being kicked and dropped and
smashed to pieces or when it's being
subjected to the occasional downpour I'm
Michael Fisher this is pocket now and
this is the rugged to kyocera torque for
Sprint let's take a look inside the box
and then have a look at the hardware of
this beast of a phone so starting with
the box here normally I would give
sprint some bunk for it's beyond
minimalistic packaging here but sprint
has made a big point of being one
hundred percent recyclable very green
for for quite some time now so we got to
give them some kudos for that not much
going on on the box as a result we just
have the printed image of the device
itself alongside some call ads for 4G
LTE capability and sprint Direct Connect
built in which we will talk about some
barcodes on the side there a little QR
code and some text that is not terribly
illegible because of its low contrast
ratio so we're going to go ahead and
ignore that and just go ahead and get
inside the box pop in the Box open we
can see the device revealed front and
center and a special cardboard cradle
we're going to take it out and give it a
little heft and then we'll put it right
alongside so we can get to the rest of
the box dump expecting much inside here
and probably not going to be surprised
some getting started guides bundled
together the recycling perhaps you can
send your old phone back to sprint if
you like got a wall wart there for the
USB cable and there is that USB cable
right down below getting all the
packaging out of the way we can finally
come back to the device the kyocera
torque appears to be every bit the
rugged device its builders claim it is
156 grams in weight so it's actually a
little lighter than we expected but it
is still heavier than some planking
galaxy s3 substantially lighter than
something like a Nokia Lumia 920
obviously brings a lot more ruggedness
to the portfolio with military standard
810g and ip67 ratings which will explain
further in our full review but the
there's also as you'll notice here
there's no earpiece along the top of the
device as we saw in our hands on from MW
MW see this is a tissue conduction
technology that allows the earpiece to
function without the use of any holes
kind of break in the glass up there
which is fascinating and offers some
practical conveniences as well there are
some sacrifices that have been made for
to make this a durable phone as we've
talked about on other durable phones
before see this is a 4 inch display a
little smaller than we're used to and it
is at 800 x 480 resolution so it's not
going to please any resolution
enthusiasts out there the camera on the
back is also a 5 megapixel shooter so
there's some compromises being made here
but let's just take a hardware tour and
see what's up android home button menu
key and back button our physical keys
not touch keys good feedback and
responsiveness from those as well as the
volume rocker and the sprint nextel
direct connect button called out in
yellow on the left here this device uses
direct connect on the cdma network not
on the ID n network that old nextel
phones used dedicated hammer camera
button on the right hand side coming
around the back we can see some charging
ports above the gasket lock there this
is familiar to us from other devices you
could just get a screwdriver or a dime a
coin in there turn it and lock it in
position to lock down the back on a
gasket and keep water out part of the
immersion rating up top we have some
additional buttons in addition to the
power standby button familiar to Android
there's the speakerphone toggle familiar
to Nextel users of old allows you to
turn the speaker phone on and off and
walkie-talkie and phone calls and
there's the headphone jack also covered
with a protective gasket let's see if we
can go ahead and pull the screen
protector off here screen protector
comes off there and we have access to
that display the battery is already
installed so I'm going to go ahead and
power on this device for a first boot to
close out our video and while it does
power on I will tell you this is Android
Ice Cream Sandwich running here not
because this Kia Sara didn't want to put
jelly bean on but because sprint has not
yet made the cdma-based direct connect
technology compatible with Android jelly
bean and there is our lock screen
preparing SD card and we're checking for
a firmware update there we can see we
don't have much battery power to work
with so our boot up is complete the
device is downloading a new firmware
package it is also talking to the
network to enable that direct connect
functionality we will cover all of this
the software features even more of the
hardware we're going to put this phone
through its paces stay tuned for come
harrison videos and our quick review
treatment but for now just an unboxing
and quick look the key is here at torque
for sprint this is just the first in a
series of videos covering the kyocera
torque for sprint follow us on all the
usual channels subscribe in the usual
manner so you don't miss it we've got
comparisons and our quick review coming
up till then I'm Michael with pocket now
thank you for watching we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
