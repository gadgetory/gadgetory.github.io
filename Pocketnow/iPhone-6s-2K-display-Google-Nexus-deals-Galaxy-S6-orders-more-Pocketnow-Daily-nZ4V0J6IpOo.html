have a sharper display google is
offering deep discounts on the next
Nexus 6 and the LG G watch our seems to
be set for end-of-life I'm hi Mary vera
and before it was sound now it's
lighting problems but the news must go
on this is parking out daily the
official news today start with Google as
this is probably the best time to buy a
google nexus 6 severe still in the
market the company has just shaved up
one hundred and fifty dollars on the
market price which is a great way to
start project five by the way but in
addition we don't really know when this
deal will end by the way so it could
last long it could last very little I
would try to get a nexus phone if I were
you right now other significant changes
in the Google Play Store have to do with
the G watch arm LG's a last round
timepiece is apparently going to find
some end of life as it disappeared from
a lot of cool Play stores in different
countries and it is running out
everywhere else as well even some other
online stores don't really have to watch
anymore and even though we don't really
have an official statement it seems that
watch urbane is the next thing which is
sad because watch urbane is pretty darn
expensive now some trusted sources in
Asia are claiming that sounds like is
dropping orders for suppliers of the
galaxy s6 by sixteen percent and here's
the catch they're not specifying which
particular phone that means it could be
the edge it could be the regular one it
could be that because of that spike in
demand that the edge in Europe that
Samsung is dropping manufacturing for
the galaxy s6 it could be so many things
which also includes the fact that the
phone is not really selling as well as
Samson was expecting a to which happened
last year with the galaxy s5 let's see
what it is now seems that Apple is not
really in plans to cancel Apple maps any
time soon we've seen the Apple vans
we've seen so many things but now
there's this job listing that apparently
points to everything going to apple maps
going cross-platform but hear me out
here we're not talking about Apple maps
going cross-platform to Android what it
is is going to turn into a web service
that could be accessed by anybody
interested and given the fact that we
doubt that there is anybody interested
at all we wonder what the point will be
but WWE
SI system light and finally for the very
interesting news of the day we've got
some other trusted sources in Asia
claiming that apple will be investing on
better displays for the iphone success
and this one is kind of hard to believe
Apple is not really the company that
will change things like display quality
between a 6 &amp;amp; a 6 s model so it could be
that this is really happening for the
iphone 7 but apparently we're going all
the way to 2k and again it's just really
hard to believe Apple believes in its
full retina HD strategy so much that
they ignore everything else but they've
been famous for leapfrogging everybody
with the retina display in the past with
the iphone 4 and it does lead me to the
question of the day if you had to pick
do you really feel the 2k or 4k displays
or overkill in a smartphone in my case I
used to think that way before I started
using the Galaxy Note edge I love that
display but leave us comment down below
