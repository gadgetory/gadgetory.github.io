physical QWERTY keyboard and we've got
some thoughts about it I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
video review of the blackberry q10 the
q10 is in many ways a younger squatter's
z10 with a physical keyboard tacked on
but while other companies might use that
change in form factor to skimp on
specifications blackberry largely
doesn't in fact one of our favorite
things about the q10 is that it doesn't
make too many compromises and hardware
we'll talk about those and follow it up
with build quality software and some
test notes the spec sheet is probably
the least interesting thing about the
q10 so let's get it out of the way right
up top if facts and figures don't fill
your balloon use this time effectively
subscribe to pocket now is youtube
channel or follow us on social networks
the q10 gets its power from a 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 backed
up by two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of
storage augmenta bowl up to 32 gigs via
a micro SD card there's all the usual
acronyms here 4G LTE NFC Wi-Fi a/b/g/n
and Bluetooth 4.0 onboard as well that's
the exact same loadout as you'll find on
the flagship z10 and the battery is
actually larger on the q10 here 2100
milliamp hours versus 1800 on the z10
more on that later what's not larger is
the display because the q10 packs the
QWERTY keyboard that gives the device
its name it doesn't have as much room
for a screen at 3.1 inches on the
diagonal it's pretty small but
BlackBerry didn't compromise on
resolution which at 720 by 720 delivers
a very sharp 330 PPI it's also an AMOLED
panel instead of the LCD found on the
flagship meaning blacks are deeper and
colors more saturated a larger battery
and a physical keyboard usually means
slightly expanded dimensions and the q10
is no exception it's a plump little
handset at 10.35 millimeters thick and
it's widened body makes it feel heavier
than its 139 grams would suggest the
added padding is minor though and it
combines with wide radius corners and a
soft touch coating over the glass we've
battery cover to make the q10 feel
really nice
the hand the machined metal volume and
mute keys sit right under the thumb the
power standby key is up top but with an
easy reach of a forefinger and the
charging and micro HDMI ports sit off to
the left leaving room at the bottom for
a microphone and a wide speakerphone
port the q10 doesn't quite reach the
level of premium look and feel as the
old Blackberry Bold 9000 but it does
update the design nicely for 2013 while
still retaining the classic blackberry
notification light which we love as for
the keyboard itself those angled keys do
the BlackBerry name proud they're a
little crowded but the steel frets
setting them apart are attractive and
functional blackberry told us they serve
to keep the keys from popping off during
impacts with the ground once we got used
to a physical keyboard again we were
able to bang out text pretty quickly
though our unit shipped with
blackberries excellent word prediction
software turned off a choice we found
puzzling
once we flipped it back on using the q10
became more efficient not as fast as the
predictive text on the z10 but certainly
fast enough those still looking for a
physical keyboard on a 2013 smartphone
won't be disappointed here the software
is another story
blackberry deserves a lot of credit for
the design and fluidity of its
blackberry 10 platform which we covered
exhaustively in our BlackBerry z10
review the design cues are identical on
the q10 if flattened for the new screens
aspect ratio but some of the fluidity
has been sacrificed as well we wouldn't
call the q10 laggy but it's not
difficult to get it to stutter and
sometimes it's just downright slow a
good example is marking items as red in
the BlackBerry hub an action which often
takes much longer than it should
sometimes the lag causes issues with
text selection which is better in
version 10.1 than it was in the initial
release but it could still use some work
playing a moderately graphically intense
game like sparkle 2 didn't give us too
much trouble though it did stutter from
time to time the big problem for
blackberry 10 remains the app ecosystem
an issue we covered pretty extensively
both in the initial review and in the
z10 episode of after the buzz suffice to
say though BlackBerry World now offers
over 120,000 apps it's still missing a
very wide swath of the most
popular titles a problem exacerbated by
the cute ends smaller display which
makes it incompatible with some of the
titles already released for the z10 if
you don't mind using the mobile versions
of websites like Yelp you'll be fine
with the q10 the browser renders page as
well and allows bookmarks on the home
screen but many apps that require deeper
level integration like Shazam Spotify or
Netflix are still nowhere to be found
older Android titles are supported and
side loading is possible for users
willing to do a little work also we do
expect more modern Android titles to
come to the BlackBerry 10 platform soon
but for now more casual smartphone users
should do some serious research into
BlackBerry's app situation before buying
on the bright side the core features of
blackberry 10 that so captivated us on
the z10 are still here in force the hub
with its peak functionality for
notifications is still excellent if slow
the multitasking active frames are still
fun and useful and the q10 s physical
keyboard means you can just start typing
from the home screen to initiate a
search probably our favorite feature
ported from Palms webOS plus you get all
BlackBerry's traditional keyboard
shortcuts as well we tested the q10 on
ATT's 3G and LTE networks between
Massachusetts and Maine over the course
of five days we had no issues with
coverage the device getting reception
everywhere from downtown to the coastal
boonies and throughput was excellent
callers said we sounded fine and didn't
complain about any background noise and
that persisted over speakerphone which
was also loud and clear on our end even
more impressive was voice and video
quality over blackberry messenger whose
new version supports video chat with
screen sharing the two megapixel webcam
delivered sharp video with good color
balance between two cute ends won over
cellular and won over Wi-Fi and of
course the bbm text chat continues to
impress with speed delivery
notifications and more the q10 sports an
8 megapixel primary camera that does
very well with still photos in ample
outdoor light colors tend to be a bit
oversaturated and exposure control is a
bit too aggressive but we were happy to
see HDR finally make it to blackberry
shots are cropped to one-to-one squares
by default presumably because of the q10
s square display but
you can select four by three or 16 by 9
if you prefer the q10 is still slow to
focus so you'll want to give it ample
time before snapping the shutter indoor
photos get a little grayer a little less
vibrant and low-light photos aren't
really very good at all we've uploaded a
raw video sample separately so you can
draw your own conclusions all in all
it's a serviceable camera but its
software needs more than time shift mode
to be more than a one-trick pony
while we weren't blown away by the
battery performance on the z10 the q10
is an entirely different story
its outstanding in five days of testing
we've never been able to run the q10 s
battery dry with normal usage even with
heavy use
we usually still find ourselves with
more than 20% charge at the end of the
day for the kind of message heavy road
warriors who will be buying the q10
that's awesome news the blackberry q10
is a very predictable device it looks
like a texting machine that also does a
little more and that's exactly what it
is if you're looking for a media
powerhouse stocked with apps this isn't
it but if you're a blackberry loyalists
shopping for a messaging focused
smartphone with an excellent physical
QWERTY keyboard and outstanding battery
life the q10 is right up your alley
it loses points for the smaller screen
but gains them right back with battery
life and an excellent physical keyboard
so we give the blackberry q10 the same
score as its z10 predecessor seven out
of ten be sure and check out our full
thoughts on the blackberry q10 in our
