curve display and even a self-healing
back cover the google nexus 5 keeps
leaking around but we still don't have
an event date annapolis quarter results
come back once again and don't
disappoint I'm hi Mary vera and what I
need is a health healing stomach because
I really don't remember what I did
during the weekend this is out
daily Thursday off with some official
news as Apple's Court results are in and
the company is not going bankrupt
contrary to what many people in YouTube
believe they made 37 billion dollars in
revenue out of which 7.5 billion were in
profit and for those are you thinking
that the iphone is going to die at the
ipad is not selling well 33 million
iphones were sold aside from 14.5
million iPads in one quarter alone and
this only included a week of iphone 5s
and iphone 5c sales and no new iPads so
stay tuned this the company's not going
anywhere now let's talk about nokia as
we know a lot of you are interested in
that nokia pro camera that's included on
the lumia 1020 and as it turns out that
company has just released a new
application called nokia camera which
mixes the pro features of the pro camera
with some automatic features that were
not included this camera application is
available for download today for the
lumia 1020 Lumia 925 and will be
available for the rest of the Lumia
high-end models as soon as 2014 whenever
the nokia black up they'd reach us
though stay tuned for that as well now
let's talk about Samsung as the recent
reports of the galaxy gear getting
returned to bestbuy probably seem to be
hitting somebody in their bottom line
because the company is now confirming
that they are going crazy trying to get
Android 4.3 approved by US carriers and
we might see it on verizon and sprint on
the galaxy s4 another new units as soon
as the next couple of days hopefully
tomorrow that would be the case and the
rest of the carrier's hopefully in one
week or two so stay tuned for Android
4.3 and a bevy of Samsung features that
work with the gear even if we still
don't recommend that you really buy it
now it's google nexus 5 time and the
only reason why i'm not bored talking
about this phone is because i really
want it but we already have a roundtable
plan for whatever this event happens but
we don't have any press invites they
monday and we don't really know for
getting an event at all but if this
happens silently or
please we are going to have a live round
table talking about it but so we got
some more League some more rumors we get
the phone in white we get the phone with
the same specifications and other leaks
and we are just waiting for the phone to
please just launched already anyways and
finally for the hot news of the day LG
has finally launched their LG G flex yes
the curve display phone that a lot of
people were not waiting for still this
Kirk phone looks very interesting it
brings pretty much the same
specifications of the g2 except for the
curve 6 inch 720p display which is not
1080p for some reason that I do not
understand but forget about that that's
not the most interesting news here
apparently the back cover of this phone
has some self healing technology that
will remove scratches after a couple of
days out of I don't know how this is
going to really work and trust me we're
really going to test this whenever our
review unit arrives but still that
leaves you to the question of the day is
this your next phone is this something
that you want right now because in my
particular case honestly the specs are
beautiful the phone might be interesting
I know Michael Fisher wants one but I'd
rather go buy a g2 right now than wait
for this curve display that I probably
would rather wait for version two but
leave us a comment down below now
