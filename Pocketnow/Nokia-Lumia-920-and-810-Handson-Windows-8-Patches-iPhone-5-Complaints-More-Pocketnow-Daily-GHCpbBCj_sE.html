phones microsoft goes back to their old
patch tuesday routine and summer iphone
5 customers are complaining about touch
response I'm hanging out to be better
and stop looking at me funny it is cold
in here and this is parking out daily
now for those of you wondering when
Windows Phone will become even more
powerful it already is well think again
as the Nokia Lumia 920 arrives at our
doorsteps at the moment the Chinese
market is getting the Nokia Lumia 920 T
which is a different device that brings
the Snapdragon s4 pro processor but wait
a second this is not the same quad core
processor that the lg optimus G and the
nexus for getting this is a new dual
core processor that's a little bit
different it brings a lot more kick and
also a better GPU so hopefully that will
reach our shores in the future microsoft
this just announced a good amount of
updates coming to windows 8 and windows
RT n well the total amount is 6 and they
include enhancements to the 0 is itself
internet explorer and also dotnet
framework among other enhancements
though didn't mention anything that mere
humans can understand now the update is
arriving on November 13 so call this the
new patch tuesday now speaking of
microsoft a lot of customers are already
complaining about their new touch covers
falling apart just a couple of days
after their service arrived apparently
the magnetic latch and the fabric are
not going along together and it's just
ripping apart and other people are
complaining about their audio being
muted because of the magnetic latch is
well so our advice remains the same
please go for the extra ten dollars of
the touch type cover which apparently
doesn't have all of these issues at
least we hope so that's speaking of
complaints I thought I was the only one
having troubles with my iphone 5 because
there is some touch response issue
especially in the top right corner but
as it turns out other people are having
the same issues and they've even film
videos about it and it does seem like if
there is an issue that could be either
software or hardware related now Apple
hasn't really mentioned what the problem
is but our advice to you is you can
always just go back to the apple store
get a replacement unit and that's
exactly what I'm going to do and finally
for the hot news of the day if you were
wondering about our reviews of the new
Nokia Lumia devices what Michael has
just answered your requests the AT&amp;amp;T
Nokia Lumia
920 in the t-mobile nokia lumia 820 to
have both arrived at his doorstep along
with a JBL powerup dock so far our
impressions are quite positive but
there's a lot more to come so that
leaves it to the question of the day
what Windows Phone that you order if you
ordered any in my case I'm going for the
white Lumia 920 but leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow was on Parker now calm
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hey Mary
