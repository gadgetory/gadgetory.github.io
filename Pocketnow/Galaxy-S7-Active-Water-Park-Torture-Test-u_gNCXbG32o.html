unique phones in Samsung's lineup
I'm a tackled the main review for this
beauty but we couldn't let him have all
the fun for 2016 this manufacturer
focused on refining their various
galaxies improving on what worked fixing
what didn't though the galaxy s6 active
was a formidable entry last year the s7
active also represents a focus on
refinement increasing the battery
capacity replacing the microSD card
expansion and providing the first
fingerprint sensor on a rugged phone the
s evan boasts some welcome improvements
over its predecessor
though the main aesthetic remains
similar take the guts of a flagship and
cram them into a more durable shell the
most impressive aspect to show off of
course is water resistance like for
reals though none of this dribble water
on it from a sink stuff yeah that's more
like it it's become a tradition here in
LA for a group of us bloggers to head
out to a water park to torture test
tough technology so let's see how well
the active survive so I think it is
really funny we've had a couple years of
waterproof phones and yet every time we
do something like this our annual Trek
out to play with ruggedized and water
resistant devices and people still act
like we're crazy for bringing gadgets
near water really I think it speaks to
the the education that these
manufacturers still need to get the word
out to consumers about the benefits of
sort of partially rugged izing or water
proofing a phone this is a great
lifestyle feature that I'm not sure as
many people are really taking advantage
of like they should be immediately we
have to praise this battery life in
getting the review unit at the water
park the phone only had about 60 percent
charge out of the box popping in a sim
connecting to LTE and shooting photos
and video aggressively for around five
hours we left the park with around 20%
remaining for a phone which is built on
peace of mind that battery life provides
a key feeling of assurance that when you
need the phone it'll be there for you
unfortunately the software er still
feels like it could use a bit of Polish
one of my favorite features and showing
off these tests is firing up dual camera
for water slides
oddly every single phone we had this day
failed on the dual camera setting so bad
that it would often crash the photo
Galleria a really scary fault to find
that maybe we had lost all of our videos
but thankfully everything but the dual
videos were recovered we've seen
numerous reports that this active might
not be quite as durable as last year's
offering and out of six phones tested
this day under aggressively wet
conditions we did have one phone start
acting up with random reboots and a
blacked out camera a situation we did
not face with last year's phone under
similar usage but of course this is also
luck of the draw we don't have a
scientific way of testing like this
moving from year to year folks if I'm
being perfectly frank I think I prefer
the lines and angles of the s6 active
over the s7 this year's phone just looks
a little softer and doughy and I really
miss that killer blue camel look but
outside of that subjective design
preference if you're looking for a
consumer facing phone built around a
higher degree of survivability than your
usual flagship the s Evan active is one
of the only options available and this
year comes with far fewer compromises
than previous rugged offerings now let's
be real we're not really supposed to
treat drug offenses when a budget phones
are rugged to protect you against those
accidental damage situation not that
you're supposed to go out of your way
see situations where you might damage
your phone but we can it be you know a
test from ticking through water slides
and fountains that this does provide a
higher degree of survivability than a
number of other options in this space
just maybe don't go out of your way to
try and break it because eventually you
will succeed as always thanks so much
