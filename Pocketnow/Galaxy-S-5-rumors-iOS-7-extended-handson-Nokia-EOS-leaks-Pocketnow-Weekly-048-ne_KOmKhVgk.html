of crayons to ios7 but how does it look
in an in hand device will talk about
that Samsung's latest blast of products
will also talk about those and a few
rumors of the Windows Phone camp Plus
listener mail on episode 04 eight of the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocket now where we discuss
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now today I'm joined briefly at
least by editorial in chief and grand
master of gradients Brandon minimun good
morning to you father do I make you
proud you always make me proud son and
senior editor and mega man Taylor Martin
good morning to you Megaman what is
though are you like that ask Taylor
question um what yeah so we're Taylor's
reviewing the galaxy mega 6.3 and it's a
loaner from negri electronics and
usually we would send it back after week
but Taylor actually might want to buy it
for personal use I just want to know why
that is crazy talk I do want to know why
too yeah yeah it's a little laggy just
like every other phone running TouchWiz
um but but the the Snapdragon 400 is
what most people don't like about it and
it's really not that bad the 400 is it
actually is faster than the note 2 in
about everything it does so it's kind of
crazy but it's actually fast um
relatively it's not gonna you know be
faster than the one which I have a
comparison making that right now um are
you doing a mega vs HTC one i am i am
i'm editing it or i was editing it
before you called me nice um yeah
yesterday was a wash though uh it was
supposed to go up yesterday and it just
it was not happening um because as some
people on Twitter heard me rant um it's
kind of noisy here okay yes I speak with
the speaking harika spook you have noise
i'm sorry i do want to get this out
before I get any more transients here um
we I have some men working on the
outside of my building and it is
happening literally right
outside my window and there you know
that's there it's awesome there there
I'm not irritated but I'm going to be
making liberal use of the mute key
because I also has the door open to the
sound booth and I have that open because
I'm listening for the buzzer because the
UPS man is coming with a with a with a
qwerty a physical QWERTY device for me
and I think Taylor you're getting that
one of those today too aren't you is it
today I think well I mean I never got to
ship they were sending it out they were
sending it out pretty much immediately
so yeah I think Taylor Martin and I both
are getting our blackberry q10 s in
today so watch for unboxing at least one
unboxing today you go your your email
responsiveness is gonna go through the
roof or what are you know yeah I know
our productivity is just gonna just
skyrocket yeah well I would but mega
yeah yeah mega dose it I I thought Tony
was crazy when he said the phone pad is
awesome and I still kind of do no
offense to Tony but the phone pad is not
gonna fit in my pocket it's about the
same size as the nexus 7 that does not
fit in my pocket this is the upper limit
of what my pocket can hold and yes it's
two-handed but I've gotten used to that
with a note I can use the note
one-handed but it's more comfortable
used to handed and the mega is a 200
device and I don't mind that it's huge
and I love it and one of the main
reasons is because it's screen is large
enough to actually have a larger or
lower DPI which means you get more
information on the screen so in the
browser you get maybe thirty or forty
percent more of that physical page
versus you know just being able to see
ya bigger it's not bigger it's more
information on the screen formerly
something you had to resort to like a
custom rom to do on right droid DNA or
something like that yeah right you can
you can root and change your your dpi
but the problem is that you're making it
smaller on a smaller screen and then if
you don't have great vision but I mean I
do but everything just gets super small
on a smaller screen on this it's big
enough to have a lower DPI so you get
tablet applications well not quite but
close to like Google now in for most
homes is full screen like all your cards
are pretty close to full screen on this
they're smaller they take up maybe
there's like a half inch margin on each
side of the card the Mustang yeah you
know ppi tail uh the pixels per inch 233
it slow you know it slow that's still
pretty that's actually a little higher
than I expected I've been working with
tablet last couple days though and in
those high ones see if you use the note
2 and you're okay with it the screen
really isn't that much worse it's it's a
little more fuzzy but it's not terrible
and and for me to be a pixel junkie and
say it's okay it's uh I was crazy I was
gonna say you got to send it to Brandon
so he can immediately give it thumbs
down yeah but I mean I've been carrying
the ipad mini and this would completely
negate their need for an ipad mini yeah
because it's so big just envisioning
that so one of the things we noticed is
that the DPI was less than 500 which we
really don't like I want to talk to
Brandon about resolution so so to suit I
just want to kind understand your your
usage of wine wine so what I want to
make a note Brendan only does have a
half hour for to be on the podcast I
really want to talk about iOS so but but
I I know you want to talk mega so go
ahead yeah so so am i right to assume
Taylor that you are used in your tab but
a lot less because this is just such a
bigger screen experience yeah I used to
carry them die pad mini and use it all
the time and I haven't used it since the
mega came in I haven't touched it so
yeah it's just it really just it is a
phablet after you use this and you go
back to the note to the note to feels
like a normal phone again like like a
like a DNA or Oh HTC One it just feels
small it's similar to after a couple
days using the note 2 going back to the
s3 for me felt like going to a miniature
phone yeah it feels like you're just
like oh my gosh but the funny thing is
i'm using two phones at once i'm using
the iphone 5 in one pocket or one hand
and the maggot in the other so i'm using
like the two extremes so yeah it's like
the mega is my tablet now and the iphone
is my phone it's kind of crazy but i
love the mega as far as as
this has gone so far it the honeymoon
period is over and I still really like
it as anyone said to you what the hell
is the matter with you why is your phone
so far yes but the funny thing is the
crazy thing I was sitting in a coffee
shop yesterday and I had several people
ask me about it one guy was like that is
ridiculous he's an iphone user avid
Apple fan he's like that's stupid why
would you ever want something that big
it doesn't even fit in my pocket he wear
skinny jeans and it doesn't fit in his
pockets but there were two older
gentlemen that i talked to regularly one
he doesn't like really like android that
much he had an EVO the original evo and
he went back to a blackberry and i
showed him the mega and he's like wow
that is awesome i want it i want it now
i showed him the note too few months
back and he's like I don't care the mega
he's like I want that who sells it I
want it right now I'm just like what are
you talking her what how old are we
talking here he is i would say late 50s
early 60s yeah see this is that's the
same as I think that happened when I was
taking my dad phone shopping and we came
across the the note series on the Shelf
either sees the note 2 and he's like wow
what's this now this I could get behind
you know because like he's not an
invalid or anything but his eyesight is
not is not as good and he's like yeah
well I can see what I'm doing on this
yeah well this guy what his reason is
he's a travel writer and he's a
photographer and he shows off a lot of
pictures to clients and all sorts of
things and he said I carry around a 10
inch tablet to show off my pictures
because it just doesn't make sense to
show it off on a phone because it's too
small that's why I went back to a
blackberry and got a tablet and he's
like that thing is big enough to where I
could show off pictures and not have to
carry a second device like it it's it's
that perfect balance between the two and
the other guy he saw the note 2 and
instantly fell in love a few months ago
he's like man what is that I want it
right now I need it I need it and he
went and he wanted to trade in his
iphone and get a note 2 and I showed him
the mega yesterday and he was just blown
away like he's like I need this that
forget the note I want this so it's
interesting because I've actually had
about a balance like my friend she she
just got an s4 and she's like I like
that mega
that's awesome I mean most people i mean
the lone differentiator on this device
is size that is it yeah it's just bigger
and it doesn't even have an S Pen like
it it's not see for me I every time I go
back to my note 2 I don't really
necessarily fall in love with the size
of the screen irie fall in love with the
s pen and the enhanced feature set
around that so the mega would just drive
a nut yeah that's one thing that I'm
definitely going to harp on it in the
review is why I'm well that should have
had an S Pen yeah yeah but why did
Samsung need to create an entirely new
brand because the note brand also has
much larger devices if the note brim was
only for this one size phone no bigger
than say 5.5 inches okay I would
understand but there's a note 8 a note
10.1 why would you create an entirely
different brand and I understand that
they're they're not building up on the
specs it's got smaller like I guess less
impressive specific yeah also the
solution is that they want to bring that
big size Android devices to a market the
segment that is not as not as willing to
spend as much money because the mega is
cheaper right yeah yeah but what doesn't
make sense is why do they have the
galaxy s4 mini why do they have the
galaxy s4 active all these other galaxy
s4's that really aren't a galaxy s4 but
they have the same branding and they can
say between yeah I have less impressive
specifications than the s4 but they also
have the same branding yeah it's really
credit close it's a phrenic approach to
get tomatoes isn't this phone would be
better with an s pen and it would be
better and probably be marketed more
marketable with the note brand well
Gribbs just me I don't know why they
would need to create an entirely
different brand so well that's not that
that's not the only new samsung brand
that we're we're seeing and we're
actually going to get to some of that in
android I do want to take advantage of
the time at brennan's here can we can we
talk iOS real quick it's totally alright
good I I do want to i do want to get two
more announcements out of the way before
we do Adam Dowd's review of the touchpad
go the webos tablet that that couldn't
or that didn't it is yalla ya go check
that it's also adam downs first video so
that's awesome i was really great to see
adam doubt
jokes in video form and not text form so
that was fun and also the season finale
of the pocket now live our hangout
series our primary hangout series is
coming up tomorrow both you gentlemen
gonna be on it or what hello yeah
brendan is gonna be there Taylor I
haven't been contacted so I don't know
oh I'm guessing that's a no you've been
her upped your characters been killed
off though has invite no has anybody hi
has a sad though oh you has a sad I'm
sorry well the tailor Martin character
has fallen down an elevator shaft so he
won't be appearing on the season finale
maybe you'll come back next season as a
ghost I'm already a ghost to the pocket
oh you are Casper ah oh the pocket and
I'll live we'll be taking a hiatus it is
not a cancellation by any means it's
josiah test and yes everyone asking on
YouTube the pocket now daily is still a
thing but Jaime Rivera has been on
vacation so when he comes back the
pocket daily will also return so all
that are being said well he's been very
great and very quick at at annotating
videos and everything that even though
its missile education and that night
yeah yeah I uploading and boom it's
annotated like wow that is crazy hi
Marissa also now has my blackberry z10 I
just sent it to him the other day nice
also segue killer yeah whatever it is it
what is it second demolisher boom boom
oh ok no no also good we only have a few
more minutes with Brendan I want to hear
about iOS 7 Brendan you've given us a
walkthrough of the new software on the
iphone Taylor I believe you are running
a beta of iOS 7 as well I am as well yes
ok so I just kind of want to sit back
and let you guys tell me about your
impressions of this new software overall
after a period of using of course i'll
be at the beta for a couple days now and
i want Brandon to go first yeah so I've
been trying to figure out how to think
about this because it's not it's not a
big change and yet it is and what I've
concluded is that Microsoft and Google
are trying to change the way that we use
our phones Google through google now and
Microsoft's through live tiles by
bringing information to you before you
need it where you know you need it an
apple isn't doing any of that it's still
a very
hunt and peck I don't know if that's the
right term kind of operating system
works just completely at based and the
redesign is extremely thorough it
touches every last little tiny part of
the operating system and the design is
is modern it seems that flat has become
modern although in three years from now
you know well be wearing bell-bottoms
again and we'll be doing skeuomorphism
this Q morphisms will be modern once
again so this is a very trendy design to
keep up with sort of the way the windows
phone is looking and that Windows is
looking in all these other flat designs
but it's a really good redesign and an
apple has introduced something I think
that's entirely new that we haven't seen
before on any other mobile operating
system and they use it everywhere and
it's so subtle but it's so beautiful
which is this like frosted glass this
Gaussian blur that my favorite example
of it is actually in the text messaging
application which i think is just a
perfect example of good design and and
like you get these blue bubbles if
they're I messages and if you scroll up
or you scroll down the UI elements are
just slightly front they're like frosted
pieces of glass in and it's just the
slightest bit you can't see through it
you can't read the contents but it's
enough to where the glass or whatever
becomes slightly tinted as you slide on
by so it's as though you're texting on
your shower door or something yeah but
it's a lot it's a lot more okay like
it's like a like a d focusing yeah yeah
yeah it's a lot it's a lot nicer than
ever the effect is that the UI elements
take on sort of the content design and
another example this is in the dialer I
don't know if you've seen this tailor
but in the dialer when you press on a
digit you see through to the wallpaper
that you said uh I haven't noticed
because I have a solid color wallpaper
so like the dialer the dialer has those
circular buttons right and you're saying
when you press on the buttons like they
become transparent and reveal your
wallpaper yeah yes so so now I don't go
ahead as I say Apple tried to sort of
define iOS 7 in like layers like there's
your wallpaper followed by your icons
buy stuff that floats on top and I get
that that the thing it thing about it is
that it still feels the same to me it's
more pleasant to use I i think i got
that delight that i was looking for that
was missing in iOS but it's still the
same old things and for me that means
that i'm going to use iOS 7 if they come
out with cool hardware i'll probably use
it but i'm probably going to be back on
android a lot sooner than I then I was
with other versions of iOS because it's
just there's there's nothing really new
here and and the newness of the glass
stuff and the the nicer font is gonna
wear off really fast yeah but that's
actually about what I was going to say
it's new it looks great and it's exactly
what Apple needed to kind of bump that
buzz up again you know turn it up a
little bit and getting people excited um
the one thing I don't like is how
colorful to you I is I like bright
colors I explain this after the
announcement I really like bright colors
I mean if you look at half of my home
screen setups most of them have really
really vibrant colors but these are like
almost pastel and in some cases their
fluorescent and neon like the the dialer
I mean not the dial the phone and the
messaging yet yeah so is it like you
like you broke up on a highlighter and
like spilled it on parts of the UI is it
that kind of color quality it is but the
weirdest thing and by the way you really
see this when you're like outdoor and
the screen automatic screen brightness
good as one hundred percent the weird
thing is I had no idea that a smartphone
to spy could display near neon colors
and it's it's a little bit ballsy for
Apple because it kind of hurts my eyes
but it's something that you don't see on
any other device because I think right
other companies are like no one's gonna
like this yeah app was like we're gonna
be ballsy enough to do it so that puts
me in mind of like one of my favorite
tweets I saw about you in this whole
discussion because like the day
following the iOS announcement 7
announcement everybody was talking about
this and they still are to a degree and
of course we're talking about a lot but
somebody was I forgot who was something
somebody said the the fact that iOS 7's
visual design is polarizing is a really
good sign that Apple's
doing the right thing and it's true
because I mean only bold moves generate
responses that are this you know black
and white I mean some people really hate
iOS 7 and some people adore it and very
few people are kind of like meh whatever
you know that's I think that's great I
and I think it is it is bold and it had
to be and a couple of other UI examples
that at first I didn't know how I felt
about that the signal bars for the first
time is literally any phone I've ever
used in my life are now these little
dots and I'm thinking myself like why
would they change something that people
are so familiar with and I don't have a
really good answer except that by
putting those dots up there Apple has
made it so that if your friend is an
iphone and they're in a third-party app
like Facebook and therefore the UI is
Facebook's you can still tell if they've
got the latest and greatest Apple
software just by glancing up at their
dots up there so it's kind of like this
identifier that helps people say yeah
I've got them I've got the new the new
thing oh well that's true because it's
always present yeah I think it ties back
to the commercial that are the little ad
they ran at the beginning about the
keynote that I didn't get to see with
all the dots tumbling everywhere and
reforming and splitting apart yeah yeah
I don't know it's it's symbolic I guess
I don't know no I wish but I wish that
that that design element kind of bled
into more parts of the OS because we
started right we started the event with
that dots commercial and wow it looks
like somebody's dropping beads of oil on
a moist towel and they're all flying
everywhere and whatever or it's like you
know Adams week congealing and doing
their thing but aside from the signal
CREF you know there's that's not really
present in any other part of the OS I
mean we got the round dialer buttons
maybe but I don't know well oh yeah yeah
its your right its only the dialer and
actually if you go into the favorites
tab in the dialer you get a little
picture now next year your favorite
people in their circles and it's so
weird because there it just seems out of
place because they're there aren't
circles anywhere else throughout the
operating system yeah just a few other
comments while I'm I'm chatting my head
off here I cannot stand these icons did
the Safari icon and the Settings icon so
every icon has been re redesigned right
every icon has been redesigned some of
them are totally inconsistent some of
them
some of them literally look like they
are made in 1982 they're just so yeah
they're they're kind of schizophrenic
again um if you look at Game Center it's
3d the bubbles have kind of a that um
arrow view to them their 3d and glossy
but if you go to the photos icon it's
flat and has the same color pattern did
you go into Game Center yet Taylor I'm
afraid I don't you just it is so weird
and silly it's just these 3d floating
bubbles I just I don't understand yeah I
mean they're dirt there's still a lot of
inconsistency here um some of the icons
are literally totally flat some still
have a little bit of a shine on the top
Taylor what do you think about the
background shifting as you move the
phone um like I said I have a flat
background a job just a plain gray and I
did that because it kind of it was kind
of useless and it looked cool for a few
minutes and it was some people when you
show them but and that that's about it I
do have it on the lock screen I have the
live little animated wallpaper on the
lockscreen iPad it's cool but that's
another thing i don't i don't like the
new lock screen it looks nice what does
it look like it's just gotta like a
swipe up arrow on the bottom slide up
shonlock know it slide up reveals the
control controls and sliding down
reveals Notification Center not quick
controls what is a control center
control center yeah yeah um and then you
have your longtime advocate the date
Eddie on health applications slide to
the left and that's the problem
notifications appear in the middle and
before you had a designated button when
you touched it would show a button and
you would swipe and you would you even
though you're opening to that on this
there's no really way to tell if you're
you're swiping to unlock or swiping to
unlock using one of the notifications
until you're already too late now unless
you do it really slowly sandy usability
shift there that's annoying yeah it's
just uh there's the the UI is so simple
there's no indication of whether you're
really opening it until you see that the
whole thing is moving all right I'm the
problem is there's no visual cue to sell
where
you should touch you have to touch on
the edge of the screen and I don't know
it's just um it's it's different it's
different and so the problem is
notifications they're so big you only
see three at a time so when I've left my
phone on you know I was it do not
disturb for two hours they're literally
50 notifications there and you just have
to scroll and scroll and scroll before
it was um it was much more condensed
these are really really large
notifications so I've got a question I
while we're talking about notifications
and the lock screen and stuff like that
we've had we've seen this kind of
predictable thing emerge where some
folks who have an eye for design or
don't have whipped up a bunch of renders
showing the iphone and then a windows
phone next to it and then finally
showing iOS 7 on a on an iPhone and the
implication of course is that Apple
stole a bunch of design cues from metro
/ modern so to show you one I mean what
what is what do you see that guy i see i
see it to a degree i think everyone
steals from each other and doesn't
really bother me all that much but do
you guys think that that's warranted I
mean Brandon would what's your thoughts
on that yeah I see Android and Windows
Phone throughout the entire operating
system and I don't really have a problem
with it I think I think it's just the
weight I mean it's kind of like would
you you know if you were building a new
house and and everyone you know the
trend was for a brick house you build a
brick house because that's a brick house
wow thanks I see it everywhere um I've
got it I gotta jump off it shortly but I
want to actually have a little closing
thought here yeah I think we're seeing
an interesting change in apple um Apple
used to be this is what I've been
thinking about as I look at iOS 7 and I
say to myself there's nothing here
that's revolutionary nothing to wow
anybody I think Apple used to be a
two-man show when Steve Jobs alive Steve
Jobs was the visionary on software he
also dude hot new hard work quite a bit
but Jonny I was really the hardware guy
and so when Steve died
the vision behind the software kind of
got slowed down a lot so they put Johnny
I've and the best that Johnny could do
is come up with kisses is it Joanie I'm
sorry is it Joanie or johnny is this
it's Johnny but I say Joanie because
it's cuz of the one end yeah sorry sir
I've got a mean interrupt I was just
curious and so I think we're gonna see a
future Apple where they're gonna be more
until they find someone like steve jobs
that can anticipate the world's
technological needs before he can think
of it i think it's gonna be apples going
to be a company that's going to focus on
hardware and they're gonna be a few
beats behind and software all the time
but there's their hardware is going to
be industry-leading generation after
generation and and and and that's gonna
side that's i think that's going to slow
the company down i think that's going to
depress the stock price because you know
we you get you get to press talking
about this stuff and saying that you
know iOS is not revolutionary windows
phone and android are better but they're
gonna rely on the hardware just to sell
product and how do you think that's
gonna go for them I mean yeah sure the
stock price may never sent may not see
it sold Heights for a while but I mean
people are still going to keep buying
iphones by the truckloads I mean
especially if the hardware is really
amazing right we've got the next iPhone
coming out in just a few months or I'm
going to be announced I mean what's
gonna happen eventually as if they if
they get too far behind in the software
and and Google and Microsoft are way
ahead there's gonna become this this
terrible disparity between what you can
do on an Android and what you can't do
on an iPhone and right now it's not that
much you know Google now you know you
don't get the same integration and
there's other things q Taylor Martin
talking about sharing a they're sharing
but like most people don't care about
sharing at about Google now but in the
future when Android can like cook your
dinner and iOS is still you know Cyril
earned one new thing who gives it when
when home appliances are integrating
with Android and not with iOS because
that's that's the next big push that's
what LG is trying to do that's what
other companies are trying to do their
fitting refrigerators and all sorts of
things with with wireless technology
that you can see what's inside your
refrigerator while you're at the grocery
store you can see you can start your
oven you can preheat your oven while
you're on your way home you know all
these new things that that Android is
capable of doing because it's open iOS
is going to have to change at least
something about being so closed I I mean
it's I don't know if that's the best
example because I've got a bunch of home
automation stuff like lighting and
climate control and it works just you
know fine on iOS it doesn't work
airports it wouldn't let him nest nest
works fine but but they had to work with
with Apple to implement that right i
mean they'd is that that's the what
you're driving at taylor yeah yeah Apple
is so controlling over what can be done
with the platform that they're holding
it back that's that's the point I'm
trying to me right and this is that
philosophical argument you can have over
and over and you know the response is
that yeah and look at where they are
they're like near the top as far as far
as smartphones in the world but then
again you Louis so is ah you that's a
solid counterpoint I was gonna say so
his Android but you have a better point
yeah so a symbian till was blackberry
mm-hmm so so it was palm at one point
yes so yeah I mean Brandon I think those
are those are excellent thought I really
I'm glad we got to get your your first
hand impressions on this I mean
obviously I we can ask Taylor anytime
but your time is limited today so we
wanted to get your get your voice on the
show so thank you yeah glad I could talk
about iOS because I've been waiting for
something to change and now it's sort of
here um anyway so uh I guys be good and
will do we will behave make me make you
a little proud well I will continue to
crush segways like I was born to ya make
sure yes that Taylor neck ways and and
Michael you make funny sounds and i will
i will keep doing I'll singing I'll keep
singing old you know 70's songs as well
while I sing show tunes no no there will
be none of that what about what about
the ink spots hey I don't
yeah alright Brandon I think I think
that's your cue I was gonna do a
drumbeat on the way out okay that's
gonna do it for this episode oh no
that's the wrong transition okay we're
gonna start talking about Android and
I'm not lose weight around all right we
get off the topic of iOS 7 can I say one
more thing yeah yeah please do I my
favorite application on iOS that I've
recently downloaded is called boxer it's
an email client that recently came out
and it it's meant to help you shift
through our sift through all your email
quickly just swipe swipe swipe swipe
kind of like mailbox um and it's broken
in iOS 7 so I downloaded it two days
before the announcement and I've been
using it and I got very used to it I
liked it and loved it now I've got
nothing like it on Android and it's
broken on iOS 7 and that's the bad thing
about downloading and installing a beta
yeah is there so many broken things so
it's definitely still a beta it's very
much a beta when you unlock the the
clock kind of overlaps itself there are
two instances of of the status bar and
you'll see two clocks to battery leaders
to everything for just a split second
and it's just it's very rough around the
edges but that gets me to my next point
it is rough around the edges it's not a
final version and we may see more
features we may see even new interface
elements and new things by fall because
that's how iOS 6 was they announced it
at WWDC and by fall it had new features
so just wanted to throw that out there
before long that's good you know that's
that's you're making a good point there
and it also gave me time to do something
unrelated so thank you welcome let's
know we already talked to mega to death
you compared to the note 2 and we
already kind of cover that at the top of
the show so I don't want to talk about
the mega but if we can jump into Android
I want to point out that we are a stupid
fickle dumb industry because I I'm
mining I you know what I'm going to talk
about I'm mining the pocket now front
page for stories for the pot for the
podcast I think I was doing it this
morning and I'm like all right what's
going on in Andhra
I blah blah and I'm like oh my god are
you serious early galaxy s5 rumors yes
look to it all metal design I feel like
I did when we did that show about the
nexus 5 like like just six months ago
and I'm like come on but i i'm i'm going
to put it in the title listeners you
already know this because you've already
downloaded it but I know I'm yes I'm
putting it in the title because you know
hey more more ears but and but also
because we do have to talk about it
briefly because I was just thinking
about this yesterday and I don't
remember exactly the terms under which
this this came about but I was like you
know Samsung has got to oh no I do
remember okay so remember how I told was
talking about the note 2 earlier in the
show yeah I was at rehearsal last night
for the show I'm doing in boston and i
was taking some notes on my no tune
almost like God I really loved this
thing I should use this more often and
then I was thinking God if only if only
I liked the design more if only the
design was a little more awesome and
then I started thinking about the note 3
which there are rumors galore about that
but I was like man what if that comes
out with a really amazing design and
then what if the s5 at some point
Samsung's got to abandon their love
affair as Stephen shank says with this
cheap feeling plastic and we've talked
about that I don't know about 150 times
but the the latest rumors or maybe the
only rumors about the galaxy s5 which by
the way who knows this came to us from
Android geeks via BGR so who knows but
and sorry not took not to cast
aspersions on either of these I was just
saying it's not our original story we
just didn't compose directly you know
that if we're to believe this source so
Stephen Samsung could be taking a page
from HTC and the one and deliver a fully
aluminum galaxy s5 now of course by this
time next year aluminum is going to be
passe and everyone else will have moved
on to you know cobalt adamantium yeah
unobtainium fully unobtainium shell oh
and the apparently this tip comes from
the anonymous trusted source close to
the South Korean phone maker who knows
what that means they could be it could
be anybody a korean street meat vendor
outside of samsung's as a South Korea
headquarter 8 degrees of separation
Sam yeah but I I think the reason I
included this in the rundown was not
just so that we could laugh and about
the stupid thing but do we really how
stubborn do we think Samsung is that's
my question to you do you think that
they will go and other generation after
getting really beaten up in the press
and some would say unfairly beaten up in
the press for using the same old
materials I mean Apple can do it because
their Apple and Samsung is massive and
they can do it I have no doubt that they
would survive and flourish even if they
did a galaxy s5 in plastic but do you
think they will Apple can do it because
they use great materials you know they
do they do and I that's a before any
argument before in the 4 s's is a fun
thing to cite when you're making fun of
Apple right because it's like look what
they did it's just the same thing but
the four was a delicious piece of
hardware yeah it was the first time and
it was the second time and it still is
with the iphone 5 although what I would
have loved to have seen it bigger and a
different design mm-hmm with Samsung
what they're doing is they're creating a
lineup that is just literally every step
between it is every stepping stone
between the smallest and the largest
foam and they're trying to get it to
where every single one of them has the
same design so I I don't want to say
that the note 3 or the s5 won't have the
same design but for them if they want to
continue this and finish what they
started they won't they'll have the same
exact plastic design with the faux metal
trim and all that jazz well right you're
bringing up memories of mwc when Tony
and I were shown that note 8 for the
first time and it matched the leaks
exactly and it looked like a blown-up s3
and it's like all right so you've got to
give them points from being consistent
you got to be like all right cool you
guys have a vision and you're sticking
with it and your your deal is
lightweight glossy plastic fo metal fine
that's your thing and you're making a
family base runner so yeah that's
another thing how likely do we think
that they're going to abandon that for
an entirely new design language given
how much they've thrown into this
already if nothing else you can tell the
Samsung device when you look at it yes a
somewhat generic yes but they're still
also like oh yeah that's it that's a
galaxy and why would they abandon
something that's perform
me so well write the s4 look at the
cells yeah it's outpacing all of the
other galaxy s cells combine which is
just nuts and this is a factor I'm sure
there's a name for this in marketing and
in sales and in business circles and all
the schools that I didn't go to the when
I was busy in acting school but you know
it's like there's that that notion that
once you are big you you you get bigger
faster right it and we've seen this to
you know you see this on youtube you see
this in any kind of metrics really like
the more audience you have the faster
your audience grows and it kind of is
the snowballing you know if the
exponential thing as narcissistic as it
may sound that's how I filled with with
twitter and google+ right now i mean i
don't have a ton of followers or
anything mm-hmm but once i started
gaining followers they just kind of
started adding on and adding on and
adding on and that's why I've just kind
of been pushing it hold on I just need
to just need to buy a domain real quick
unfollow Taylor Martin's haha yeah yes
oh yes you're right and they're doing so
well because they're so big and because
the name recognition is so great with
the galaxy Brian now yeah it's it's um
it would be stupid for them to abandon
it at least marketing wise absolutely
but to appease the press the only people
that are really upset about it it really
wouldn't make that much sense from a
business standpoint yeah cuz feet
millions and millions tens of millions
of people are buying these things and
then were yes and dozens of millions
more will and it's yeah yeah I mean it's
true yeah it's not going to stop um
because it has plastic yes it feels
cheap but yes it works right and it's
the most well-rounded offering on the
market it really is like most
well-rounded in terms of like how do you
mean it it speaks to just about everyone
it has a removable battery expandable
storage the best specifications you can
get on a phone at least the best
collection of specifications you can get
on a phone right great camera so it has
its like the iPhone I've said this for
years the iphone is not
best it's never really been the best at
everything but it's great at everything
so it's it it's but that's what it does
it's yeah it's it's it's it's really
great at what it is able to do yes so
let me rephrase that it's the best and
only a few things but overall it's a
very balanced device it's it's great at
a lot of things not the best at
everything so the samsung's their
samsung d samsung samsung's newest
devices are kind of the same thing
they're they're really balanced in that
they're great at a lot of things but
they're not the absolute best and
everything and that's that's a good
thing yeah we're seeing the galaxy s4 is
its use me the galaxy family well and
the galaxy s family grow here we've
complained a lot about the galaxy brand
dilution here at Pocket know and I think
rightfully so because Samsung really
just will throw the name galaxy on
anything mobile anything with a with it
with a radio in it basically Oh some
bluetooth headset it's the Galleon
samsung galaxy blue yeah right like that
does s4 i probably should but yet
they're even there even but they've
always shown a little bit of restraint
with the s monica right there's like
galaxy yes exactly and that's what i
want to talk about so we saw the galaxy
s we saw the galaxy s2 and then all the
u.s. variants of that the galaxy s3 and
then they started doing this galaxy s3
mini galaxy has too many that's kind of
thing in the galaxy s4 mini blah blah
blah blah blah but now we're starting to
see the galaxy s4 active and we
announced that this was official i think
last week we didn't announce samsung
announced and we talked about it on the
show no we announced it yeah we announce
yourself Sam house does to announce yeah
exactly right I'm sorry I'm sorry you're
right but we the galaxy s4 active became
official to the surprise of no one but
now just this morning before the show
started we got the release from AT&amp;amp;T
that the second largest carrier in the
US is going to pick it up and it's going
to launch soon it's launching it unlike
in like Oh dearest yeah it's launching
in exactly eight days also I can hear
the construction in the background oh my
yeah you could probably hear big trucks
driving by in my background so I can't
can't hear anything Ephram you're an
electron because I'm just getting hit
remember I mean a four by six box with
dudes directly outside with staple guns
like it's it hurts what are we talking
about so the guy was Erez and so we
talked about the galaxy s brand but now
we're seeing the galaxy s4 active which
is gonna launch in a like a week and
that's exciting to me because I love
waterproof phones I love and what have
we complained about this whole time with
the s-series whatever we just talking
about Taylor the Samsung phones right
well that but the galaxy phones feel
cheap because of this hyper glazed BS
and Samsung has proven it with devices
like the rugby for AT&amp;amp;T and some others
that they know how to make a beefy
device that actually feels sturdy in the
hand so mix most of the specs from the
galaxy s4 with that hardcore physical
construction I mean you have a beautiful
device there with a 1080p just display
that can you know endure some abuse I
can't wait to test it out and I'm really
looking forward to just just beating up
on it and seeing how well it can hold up
because they're active period that one I
would love to I actually waiting to hear
if we get a review device soon or not
because actually we we kind of
extensions really good about getting us
devices early they're probably the best
and I'm a little surprised we don't have
one already so we will see you know I've
dead like eight Samsung phones right
here seriously yeah I'm just buried in
samsung prada because they're really
good with demo devices i really like the
way to do it but you know hey we'll see
but that's not the only new Galaxy S
device we also also have an official
announcement of the galaxy s4 zoom wah
wah let's talk about this thing huh
listeners if you don't know what the
galaxy s4 zoom is neither do we I am
looking at a photo of it right now and I
still don't really get it it's like a
galaxy camera and a galaxy s4 mated and
produced an offspring it's like they cut
both of them in half and just glued them
together yeah just Tony even calls it a
Frankenstein device in the post
apparently this
so it's if you are not looking the post
if you're running like our friend Nick
gray is or if you are riding the bus or
something and you can't look this up it
looks like a galaxy s4 with a big ol
lens sticking out the back I mean that's
about the best i can do right yeah yeah
except for its really really really
rounded very rounded but just rounded as
the s4 is no look at the back you see
the back I don't see the back because
there's not a back there's not a photo
of the roll down to the comments to the
comments oh alright oh oh uh uh it's
very very very very real so grant Butler
posted the the press image of the back
of the thing we I went to a school the
guy named grant Butler is that right
what nots the same guy so I don't know
look look the shutter release has been
moved to the top too just kidding it
wasn't grandmother just kidding no well
that's dumb so yeah son lens this thing
but you know I think it actually looks
better than the galaxy camera does I
always thought the galaxy camera was a
clunky looking thing this actually looks
like I wouldn't mind carrying it now you
know it's funny i'm tempted to because
of the speed with which samsung appears
to develop things i don't seriously
believe this but it is funny to think
about to think that maybe this is a
product of all those eos rumors like
three weeks ago Sam seems like wait what
are they building all right a couple
this together real quick and then like
back ya hear galaxy s4 soon this is just
photoshopped this isn't even real yet
right yeah this thing that now ow do you
HD oh I'm sorry it's a qhd screen yeah
4.3 inch super amoled with qhd 965 words
I 40 ouch 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor that be Harry no idea what it
is varies on the market though it could
it that might change for ya ok a 16
megapixel main camera on the back I got
a chance could fix that touch yes this
was made in Maine this camera only works
in the northeastern United States a ten
times optical zoom at between 24
millimeters and 240 millimeters
and f-stop 3.1 to 6.3 24 millimeters at
3.1 is actually pretty terrible so yeah
yeah android is Moses yeah most you'll
see 2.81 something you know most phones
are 2.1 I believe all right right um one
point five gigabytes of ram 8 gigabytes
of internal storage that needs to stop
Samsung stop it yeah because we see I
storage thousand four and because the
stein the counter-argument is well it
has a micro SD card slot what do you
care about on-board storage and the
reason you care about on-board storage
still is because the stock image
TouchWiz image takes up one point five
gigabytes before it installed get out of
here Samsung come home and yeah as I
understand it now I was always one of
these people I was like I don't care if
you put four gigs of storage ons and
just give me a memory card slot and I'm
fine but i took whoa but android doesn't
really or google doesn't really
incorporate the SD card with android
anymore matias duarte has effectively
killed that it that ship has sailed how
I'm not behind on this news legitimately
I actually don't know why he came
forward and said before that having two
drives is more confusing for the end
user it's better to just have everything
with onedrive I can agree to that
somewhat the microsd card slot has a
purpose it does but the way that it's
working in android now it's kind of
useless unless you carry your own media
what happened before is you could move
all of your apps or most of your apps to
the SD card using stock software without
rooting without anything you just
download all your apps move them over to
the SD card now you can't do that they
took that option out interesting so an
SDN SD card is used only for your own
media or if you root which is not a
valid argument you can move apps and
other content over to the SD card
interest ending is not a valid argument
stop it people hey I'm on my soapbox
today no that's cool I dig it I was just
looking at this image again of the
galaxy s4 zoom and you see that hole in
the top yeah that I'm not seeing this
called out on the sheet and maybe I'm
missing it but it looks like there's an
IR port
the thing just like ps4 yeah that's ir
yep is it called out on this thing
mm-hmm no no no no anyway um I'm so
happy the mega has I or it's like a it's
the old technology that should be in
everything because I don't want to reach
for my my TV remote all the time yeah a
phone cuz i'm already i usually have it
in my hand anyway when i'm already on
the like when i'm watching TV so boom
power the TV oh yeah yeah so if you if
you are checking this post listeners you
can go down to the comments actually
people have been sharing some pretty
cool images including a hilarious
somebody has intelligent yeah grafted
onto a phone it's awesome but also a
comparison a side shot comparison of the
rumored eos from nokia and the assess
for zoom and in that side shot the
galaxy s4 zoom certainly shows it's true
colors you know I just don't like this
thick but you know I don't mind it I've
always enjoyed that little antenna bump
that the nexus s had and that the Galaxy
Nexus head to a smaller extent and
holding it vertically you can see that
the galaxy s4 zoom it would look almost
exactly like that I don't really mind
that bump at the bottom / looks like a
big bump I know Tony won't let very
thick time not sure the quality will be
all that great of the images yes no
totally because the galaxy zoom images
wait hold on what do we go to camera
images are not that great exactly that's
what I'm saying so yeah yeah for what it
is it's not all that great if this were
like a sony phone this might be
something that i would buy i love so
many sony imaging I just I'll just say
that yeah yeah here's the tablet z yet
that's a different story ah yeah take
pictures with your tablet you should be
smacked at least once per picture once
per shot wide 100 i shooed so well I
deserve a couple smacks myself yeah
alright we trade smacks to the next
stretch here I mean I'm not gonna offer
anything up that I'm not willing to take
so I just experienced like a bout of
melancholy actually just when you were
talking before about storage my mind
wandered I'm like how
tradeshows I we're not in trade show
season I'm not going to any that's sad I
haven't been anywhere since January i
know i can think of my passport when he
said I was going to e fo yeah well I
don't have my passport I have to get
that like yesterday I think the thing is
I went to all the shows last year so I
don't think I go to any shows that's
coming here like I think I used up all
my fun cards last year but anyway anyway
let's move on to windows phone please
because we were talking about the years
and we might as well jump right into the
Nokia EOS looking like the Lumia 920's
twin which is this fun headline from
Tony where that somebody has placed this
is visi leaks i think yes from via
wpcentral visi leaks has put a Nokia
Lumia 920 next to a Nokia EOS apparently
by this time it might be debunked but we
don't have an update tag on this but
anyway they look very very similar from
the front yeah the first busy leaks was
faked or at least it looked very faked
because it was sitting in the grass
there it was sitting in the grass and
there were two different yet light
sources and the branding on the camera
was actually not embossed so so some it
was some of it was an inset and some of
it was not at all his flesh for flesh
flush with the surface it wasn't okay
you as human relations made with you
mean flip a killer I mean look at the
awesome watermark on this how can you
not be hip gosh well yeah but you know I
can believe this a look but it's this is
kind of losing weight the aspect yeah
the aspect ratio is different what do
you got it on the wet on the display or
just the the actual the photo well no
the the actual size of the devices the
eos is actually wider than the 920 you
mean based on this photo are you saying
that this credit photo or are you saying
that's interesting about this rumored
device it's interesting okay it looks
wider the one with the camera bump or
not bump but uh
the one on the right shutter button
yadon online 920 looks looks wider no
the Lumia 920 on the left looks wider to
me yes okay that's looming yeah the one
on the right is the note so what this
proves the point right they look so
similar from the front and both of these
are black devices and so it's it's
harder I mean if they were whiter or
cyan you could really tell body shape
differences but you there's not as much
detail because these are dark colored
cases but what's interesting to me is
that we haven't seen this design
language before we haven't seen
something as close to the Lumia 920
before the 928 looks nothing like a 920
from certain angles the 925 same
difference the you know like Lumia nokia
has decided to branch out from its and
nine sourced you know design lineage but
with this eos rumor Toews we're looking
at something that's very much like what
they were doing before so I'm confused
which is also apparently running the
next version a windows phone because it
has the time um yeah at a time long
clock yeah yeah yeah so I mean and
that's cool i mean we expect that but I
just didn't expect them to go backwards
in design unless they've decided that ok
for the variance we're going to be fun
and we're going to make stuff like the
810 the 822 and the 925 and whatever but
for the core solid flagship like for the
for the year long halo we're gonna stick
with the old design I don't know it's
like Nokia is doing what Android
manufacturers were doing two or three
years ago which is what were they stick
making carrier specific devices own
different designs yeah no totally yeah
that's exactly what's going on here and
this looks like ok so the say the 920 is
the galaxy s2 and the 925 is like the
galaxy s2 epic 4g touch yeah yeah and
then your your your EOS here would be
the galaxy s3 or s4 yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's a good analogy I think if
this is true now i don't know if this
observation means that i don't trust the
leak anymore but there's also seeing so
many of these right they there has to be
something to this yeah and and it could
also be that this is a
think of it like a shell but not
finished hardware it's not a finished
design it could be totally that that the
the finished product might look more
like the 928 or something new or
something different but they stuck with
you know an older design for the
development process because we've seen
that before as well we have yeah I mean
normally when when there's it's not a
case right I mean normally when they
throw in a case we can tell but I
understand what you mean if they're
loading all the component dummy box but
then again you know there are enough
differences here what I think that would
require an almost entirely different
design and I don't think Nokia if you're
talking about Samsung I'd be like oh
yeah but I don't know if nokia has the
resources to be like okay we're first
we're gonna run a design on this beta
hardware that's never gonna see the
light of day and then we're going to
design this also this other case for it
I don't also be using like reusing
scraps yeah I don't know hey hey
pinching pennies man yeah man we all do
it we have to in when you got to we're
seeing I don't have this in the rundown
but we're actually seeing some
encouraging numbers out of Nokia i think
in finland they finally well samsung's
came along and smacked him down in
finland writer but then they somewhere
else in europe I'm sorry that I didn't
put this on the run down now it just
didn't occur to me we were seeing some
encouraging very encouraging sales
numbers from Nokia if anybody in the
wants to point that out in the comments
that would be awesome because I'm
totally blanking right now and I don't
want a google it I just scrolled down to
the comments and there is an awesome one
from Adam he says every time I see a new
pic of the EOS I throw all my money and
credit cards at the monitor but nothing
happens yes yes yes you and every single
one of us okay tell me about it i would
i would give Windows Phone a try for
something like the ears I'm saying it
now and I mean it you can call my bluff
I mean it unlike you saying you'd go
back to the what LG LG rumor rumor yeah
like Taylor and I'm a were having a
conversation on Twitter about iOS versus
Android and I was like you frickin
people the chicken and the egg scenario
where it all started who copied who
first yeah
so so boring but it was a fun fun
discussion uh let's close windows phone
because we have Wow way to discuss well
basically the Huawei is basically the
least exciting loi em to discuss in some
instances like I don't necessarily get
very excited about their android phones
but it's always nice to see another
windows phone OEM even though i don't
think it's looking very good for for
Windows Phone OEMs i I just I don't
think anybody really has much interest
in developing for it not develop why why
do we linking hardware that you have to
pay for when you could develop for
android which there is a
counter-argument to that because most
and really woody has next about him i
decided to use and they but they pay the
licensing fee to migrate yeah exactly
nobody you know it said because i was
very excited back when windows phone 7
launched and was like wow look at all
these guys they've got a big on samsung
they've got LG they've got HTC and then
there was a who's who's the who's the
fourth who's into the fourth and that
blast of Windows Phone 7 devices do you
remember Del oh yeah del with the venue
pro the most awesome thing I thought
Dell was gonna come back on the venue
pro because back then I just found buzz
was huge so but I learned not to trust
del after that that so-called III player
that they were gonna release back in the
day oh yeah is that thing I don't know
it was so impressive everybody was like
yeah this is gonna kill ipod and then it
launched and nobody bought one yeah that
happens right but see so but what has
happened is that as that is abdul you
know windows phone 7 ran into
difficulties it wasn't adopted then they
had to change the engine while they were
on the racetrack with Windows Phone 8
and we saw these manufactured saw like
these bombastic announcements like HTC
comes I was like check it out now we're
the awesome windows phone manufacturer
and that just totally fell apart yeah
well you know my stance on the start of
windows form ah I wrote that editorial
that you said was gonna just start a
flame war and some people were like
trailers are windows hater bamo like
they always are mm-hmm but nobody really
said anything like a lot of people
actually agreed with what I said about
windows home being boring by design now
you said I was wrong in that but I
didn't even go into the comments on that
because I was afraid ask what does get
like 170 comments right now I don't know
I I wanted to stay away from it it was
it was crazy because you know for the
first like four or five hours there
really weren't any negative comments but
I was like is is this thing like
actually live or somebody just
accidentally find this in cherry but uh
yeah there there were really no negative
comments and there are some in there but
it's not the typical you know typical
explosion yeah it's for march against
Taylor um it's a yeah there are some
people that were like yes like their
their marketing was very it was a very
poor decision like it sounded good at
the time i'm sure it really it really
really did against you know black with
listeners we're talking about the
initial microsoft add blast with like
you need to be saved from your phone
yeah get in get into life yeah the
slogan was Windows Phone will save you
from your phone and you know that wasn't
rate long and it was the approach yeah
look there was a there was a that was a
ever used that as a tagline oh yeah it
was on an ad there was an ad that said
that at the end in text really yes um
that's where I got it if you google
search windows almost save you from your
phone you can probably find it that's
right actually I'm gonna do it now I
already did it and now Google's not
giving me any of that action ain't got
nothin I ain't using clothing I know the
white windows phone you know the pops up
pops up a lot of headlines that are very
familiar in style windows phone 7 ads
save us from our phones video yeah okay
I believe you oh oh this video is
private oh well anyway it doesn't matter
so the point is we we yeah we had this
Windows Phone thing we had this ad push
okay today junior Ted I said today no so
we have this ad push the apush didn't
work right windows phones an option
right blah blah blah blah blah the point
is it's struggling to gain market share
like it has been for years and as a
result some manufacturers have backed up
when was last time we saw an LG windows
phone we have never seen an LG windows
phone 8 device correct I wanted to write
one might say that that's not a big loss
but yeah I don't know I disagree with
devices like the optimus G proving that
LG can do interesting
I would like to see another OEM there
and then we had Huawei who was kind of
strong on it and I expected the w1 and
w2 like ages ago but those did not
appear until recently I think some
people have I think I'm gadget has a
review of the W one out or something but
this w2 is now rumored and the
suggestion is that from the ad copy
which shows it sitting in a tornado of
water that the huawei w2 could be
waterproof which is obviously one of the
big things that's going on in phones
right now and we don't have outside of
Japan I don't think we don't have a
windows phone that is waterproof right
just just to update you on my status I
just yawned a little bit did you did you
wanna thank you thank you yes I found
the ad if you'd like it I don't I don't
know I I hate that I hate that idea
don't send that to me hold on i will
read it to you then all right it says oh
come on now youtube buffering I don't
hear I don't Kate I don't I don't care
you're right here we go I don't care
it's time for phone to save us from our
phones the new windows phone seven pack
of the new windows phone to get us in
and out and back to life so my my take
on that is that by design it is meant to
be kind of uninteresting because they
want you to use your phone put it back
in your pocket and give back I always
thought that was a bit of a stretch i
don't think that's ever what they wanted
to do i think that's what the I think
the ad people looked at that looked at
the windows phone and they took it home
and they used it for a couple of days or
weeks and they were like oh all right so
here's this take let's do this bold
fresh take on it and you know what I
have to say those ads were funny oh yeah
they were funny with a guy like using
his phone at the urinal and the other
guys like really and they did he
probably the hot wife who's dressed up
and she's like really yeah yo a dropped
it in the Arnold in it yeah he dropped
it that's the kid the kid who gets
kingdom-based beaned in the head by a
son yeah like I those ads were awesome
they were funny yeah but they were
basically directly trying to compete
with blackberry and and that enterprise
market where you know being off your
phone isn't
because right now it's a work phone and
they want you to use it get back to work
that was what blackberry was always
designed for and that's why I'd never
really succeeded in the consumer market
and it was so great at you know I think
you're I think you're overreaching I
think it did succeed in the consumer
market pretty well trillion tlie with
the pearl and the curve well I mean it
did for a short period but what I'm
saying is that the company never ran
itself blackberry never ran itself as a
truly consumer-centric company was
always about enterprise first right it
was so that's what I was trying to get
two babies like United Saddleback one
day next up next up was enterprise for
for a long time was corporate it was
construction work and then they were
like oh hey people really like this
walkie-talkie because they can save on
their minutes yeah that's have a string
of retail stores so rather than it
didn't perform well in the consumer
market it did a lot of people had
blackberries for a long time but it
didn't succeed long in the consumer
market it was it was like it flared up
and then the iphone came out and then it
just kind of died off yeah so yeah so
you know I don't know if this is with
this will be exciting I don't think we
have a I don't know if we have a huawei
windows phone on sale in the States I
know but engadget generally doesn't
review stuff that hasn't gone sailor
here so I don't know what do you there
you go what is this the ad I don't I
don't get your I'm like waving I'm so
done talking about this stupid head oh
you funny smartphone addicts commercial
yes yes all right so anyway the point is
I'm done talking about that Huawei
waterproof I want a waterproof windows
phone that's all I'm saying I want to
waterproof phone well it bone could get
out of the galaxy attractive though get
what what what's the matter with you get
a you had the Xperia Z for a while I had
the Xperia Z for a while that's all I'm
gonna say a waterproof well with that I
think it's time for listener mail wow
this is the earliest i've ever been to
listener metal yeah i know i know well
the thing is i'm just antsy i want to
get to the q10 it's not even here yep i
want to get to it I want to get to the
last listener mail question yeah well
the thing is we actually a really good
listener mail this time around so i
wanted to say so i'm just a note before
we actually read some of these letters
some of these pieces of listener mail
have got have gotten really kind of
Awesome questions that are very
technical and you're getting wrong
they're getting long again please keep
these short guys please please please
because we are usually in a time limit
but the thing is some of these technical
questions are ones that I can't answer
on the podcast and almost nobody can I
think joke is the only one who can
answer a couple of these so what I'm
doing is I'm holding those in the buffer
and I'm going to if it's possible turn
them into editorials if Jo has the time
to do them because some of them are
really awesome technical questions so
please stay tuned for those if you
haven't heard them on the air you don't
trust me you know you're actually really
good too but dad but you're you know Joe
like builds this stuff for Olivia Jojo
does know a lot more than I do about
development yeah low-level stuff colonel
stuff yeah it was a lot more I know
quite a bit but that's only from
tinkering and learning through trial and
error he actually knows this stuff
because he does it for a living exactly
and that's why I called him the handyman
in our little commercials he's the
handyman yeah there are a lot of coming
because I I posted that pocket now
commercial on it to my personal Facebook
and I was like hey here's our new
commercial and the only comment I got
was Joe which I just had to read in his
voice when I read it to myself he just
shows up and all he says is I'm the
handyman wow that's kind of creepy but
uh yeah I can't no idea what I was gonna
say well good let's get to Justin's
piece of listener male hello pocket now
my name is Justin and I listen to your
podcast every week during my commute to
school I might be in the minority but
sometimes I wish they were a bit longer
actually Justin you are not a lot of
people say they wish the podcast could
be longer and then that's why he keeps
asking me to come back because I keep
talking right because you just drag
Taylor drags it out like a pro but then
like right after those comments asking
for it to be longer there's always some
dip but whose is true walls like O'Dowd
43 who listens to this much podcast we
want a an hour and 43 minute podcast
condensed it three minutes right we
expect no less a time so Justin thank
you and also thank you for telling us
where you listen to the show because I
have this really weird thing where i'm
like i really like knowing where people
listen to us like like i say our friend
Nick
just let us know that he listens to the
show on on his run on his jog and he's
certainly not not the only one of those
and he's from HTC source com by the way
our friend Nick from from from CES in my
case that did you yeah did you had
enjoyed in me as well sorry I always get
get it messed up who writes for whom got
any weight Justin we're rooms were
stepping all over your email i'm sorry
i've been thinking about this question
for some time now says justin and i was
wondering what the pocket out team
thinks do you think google will ever
partner up with other OEMs to release
google edition tablets also how do you
feel about google edition tablets being
released and then justin talks for a
while about as his own thoughts on this
now this is a good question at something
i haven't really thought about okay well
we cuz we've seen google edition
smartphones right we've seen the galaxy
s4 Google edition we're about to see the
HTC one google edition these are cool
things and we're familiar also with
nexus smartphones and now nexus tablets
but this is a specific question about a
google edition tablet tablet that was
released initially with the skin and
then is given a google edition treatment
right yeah um what would be the one what
would be the one for you i don't know 22
points to make here a lot of tablets
come with a lot more lightweight
software than their their smartphone
counterparts as soon as it is a perfect
example yeah yeah yeahs assumes is a
perfect example because their tablets
are very stock like there's very little
um they make very little changes when
they build the software for their
tablets which which is a different story
now that they have you know the phone
pad and the the the PadFone yeah cuz
they but what the transformer brands
were very stock like but then you get to
the galaxy tabs the galaxy notes and all
these other tablets and yes absolutely
every manufacturer ever should make all
of their phones available as a google
edition at least maybe not cell phones
or tablets both and and maybe they don't
need to sell them through google but
they should offer stock android on every
phone because it's not that hard so this
they have to that is not hard right but
but but here's the thing think about the
galaxy note 10 dot one running stuff
android it would be useless you wouldn't
be able to use the S Pen right yeah like
the it wouldn't be optimized for those
stereo speakers I don't think I mean I'm
just kind of talking about there but the
S Pen is the real thing like yeah that's
Billy's the only reason I would consider
a galaxy note n dot one is for the s pen
and you wouldn't be able to use it yeah
but the google edition galaxy tab would
be a great idea why what because our
galaxy tabs exciting why wouldn't you
just buy a nexus 10 well yes in in this
case you would use her buy a nexus 10
but I don't know yes I mean what would
you mean exciting stuff no I'll tell you
what an xperia tablet z yeah okay yes
and actually justin says that a google
edition xperia tablet z would have
expandable storage would also be able to
upgrade to the latest OS updates and of
course hungry waterproof so that would
be my number one choice i think yeah
right now it's kind of hard to say
because there are so many tablet
manufacturers that really slowed down a
sous was pumping out like six or seven
eight different tablets per year and
they really haven't done much of
anything this year minus the the PadFone
and foam pad so they really really
turned that notch down quite a bit
samsung they were releasing Galaxy Tab A
the Galaxy Tab 8.9 the galaxy tab 10.1
the galaxy tab 7 the galaxy tab oh god
I'm just asleep already I can't even
keep up with all the galaxy tabs and
this year they've had white rose I don't
know much Galaxy Tab 17 the Galaxy Note
8 and that's well know that they've got
the galaxy tab 3 or whatever has been
announced yeah anyway I'm saying like
they've all kind of turned it down a
little bit yeah um and I think it's
because gallic certain I gallic but
android tablets haven't performed that
exactly the iPad that's exactly it they
get the android tablet world is just so
as a whole frankly in my opinion is very
very uncompelled i don't get it we go to
these trade shows and you literally guys
you can walk along the edge of the
perimeter of the trade show in the
wooded we caught the cesspool at CES and
you could just find hundreds of Android
tablets is it is the future everyone
predicted back in 2009 except it's and
it's just as bad it's these kind of
knock off brand less android tablets are
everywhere and even the ones from the
may
brands are underwhelming in most cases
yep last year I would only have
recommended three tablets and all of
them were made by a sous yeah so it was
the the transformer pad offended
infinity the transformer pad 300 i think
it was and the nexus 7 which getting
back to those a sous tablets getting
back to do the question you wouldn't be
able to run them if they were google
edition or you wouldn't be able to run
them with their keyboard docks right oh
yeah you would oh it's just a it's just
a keyboard at that I'm sorry sue
keyboard is that so okay so those are
sorry you're right those are the
opposite example those are the example
of a good one in addition to the tablet
see okay so so yes they should be
available but he's like the note 10.1 no
because there are things that really
make it a different tablet that Google
or stock software would not take
advantage of the S Pen for example yeah
so Justin makes them some great points
here and it actually says the tablet
purchases occur less frequently to in
comparison to phones so having
future-proof software's welcoming I
totally agree Justin and it would be
awesome I just don't think that there's
really enough buzz yet with Android
tablets because of all the things we
just talked about too yeah to make this
likely but Google i/o this year showed
their dedication to pushing android
tablet development yep so which every
area every other phrase was Android
tablets yeah develop Android tablet apps
tablet apps tablet apps tablet apps I
mean it's just like okay we got it yep
and then a couple more hundred crimes
tablet a tablet apps yeah which is which
is great and it was so anything can
happen in the future as always and
Justin thank you for the email that is
an awesome awesome awesome question and
moving on to John Blake hi guys i would
like to start off by saying i really
appreciate the podcast they were very
informative and a great source of
entertainment for me thank you John
welcome I currently have the essence
before s and my contract isn't in soon
my question is now that iOS 7 has been
announced and we'll work on the iphone 4
and up what would it take for you to
upgrade to the new iphone over the
iphone 5 don't like okay yeah so John
goes on to talk about is course gonna be
a little thinner and lighter i know this
impossible to predict but if you were in
my shoes here's the real question would
wait the extra month and see what is to
come or would you assume that like most
iphone upgrades there will only be a
slight improvement and just get the
phone now like the f-15 or maybe even an
HTC One John I'm not going to go into
the HTC one territory if you want to
switch to android that's a totally
different totally different conversation
what is very interesting to me is this
question of should I wait a couple
months or should I get something right
now I will never ever tell anyone if
there's a device coming along in three
months or less if there's an almost
guaranteed chance that we're going to
see a new device in less than a quarter
or a quarter of a year I never tell
anyone to get what's out there right now
because even if you're seeing a jump
from the four to the 4s for example the
4s actually performed much better in
terms of speed and even a day when I
hold a 4 and a 4s and I run like current
apps on the current software like the
four just lags like a champ and the 4
s's like what's up I'm just exactly you
know yep speaking to food
future-proofing that's kind of the point
here if you wait just a couple months
you're going to get a phone that's going
to last a little bit longer right
because the software coming in the
future so yeah say you go with the
iphone 5 it might not run well on iOS 8
next year exactly and I have I have a
friend who constantly consistently
upgrades her iPhone one generation
behind like when the iphone 5 came out
she was getting like the 4s and I'm like
are you serious like you III get it
right I understand why you would want to
save a little bit of money up front and
I understand that not everyone can
afford that extra hundred dollars at the
purchase point totally I can't I just
put it on credit cards and I'm just an
idiot but the thing is I it is anathema
to me to to buy the last generation
product when the new generation brothers
come out because Taylor you said it
future-proofing you just just don't want
to get too far behind especially with
Apple products because adding Apple gets
a lot of unfair flack just because they
do so many things well but some of the
most justified flack they get is that
their new software runs like crap on
older devices you know I think it's
partially intentional I think it is too
I mean an accident by any strategy has
been the court over it before there have
been lawsuits intentional like built-in
obsolescence they've been sued over i'm
a surprise they deserve it because it's
sickening so anyway John just lean is
get the original iphone get the 07
iphone and just use SMS and that's all
you need or the LG rumor good device or
deer there you go very nice so thanks
for all your help and keep these
podcasts coming you're about halfway to
100 it is true John we're coming up on
our one-year anniversary of the pocket
now weekly podcast I'm just jazzed about
that i love this podcast it's so much
fun it is it is i'm sad when when
Michael's like no you do not get to be
on the podcast this week no I'm sad
about that too but just like okay I'll
uh I'll just sleep in that date yeah
yeah I'll be record in the morning with
my least favorite aspect of the bakken
our weekly I have to wake up to do it so
next question is from kind wha Murphy
quinoa Murphy it's about it so uh kind
kind of cranky noir I don't know but in
what is definitely not quinoa that is a
food and it's not about anything like
that hey you don't know man you know Tim
king was delicious by the way I I need
to look this up you want to look at you
like I cannot look at the stain real
quick just call them Murphy now that's
like district so mortal and whatnot
right meaning of quinoa quinoa kind of
baby names origin origin is Hawaiian Wow
well I can see that its meaning is the
name and now i have a funny videos for
moms ad blasting in my ears featuring
the cast of monsters so i'm very
distracted thank you very much free
dictionary or who everywhere anyway
let's get to the point for the record
says the mail you guys are awesome thank
you also i really hope this is where to
send listener mail because my ipad
doesn't show a description of the last
weekly and my 7th gen nano is confusing
amen anyway i have a question for you
what if webos never really stopped what
it was doing what if it kept on going
and gained the traction of os's like iOS
or android even got the amount and
quality of the apps that they have and
webos was starting to pick up at one
point do you think that it would be
popular maybe android or iOS popular
hope you guys will respond with your
opinion awesome question yes and I
thought yes or and Taylor says it was an
awesome
question well it was an awesome question
okay um would it be popular maybe Palme
was popular back in the day so there's
every bit of possibility that webos
could have been popular I think it came
at the it was just a poorly timed
product because it came out right just
before the second android phone hit the
market and that was the cdma HTC hero on
sprint which they launched right beside
each other a few weeks apart and or
maybe it was now the hero actually came
came right I've been know a bit later
actually the the pre beat the hero
because that's right was already doing
was already starting to struggle a
little bit and then I saw sprint talking
about the hero and I was like guys don't
don't do this don't just jump off the
pre did too yes right yeah because i was
working at best buy at the time and um
yeah i got to free the day before it
launched I think did you really yeah the
pre yeah I had the original pre I didn't
know how that you rocks the original pre
what we talked about this a few weeks
ago I had the original pre the pre to
the preclusion yeah I'm sorry but I
didn't oh you got it yeah I didn't know
you got it on launch day I guess you got
it on webos day 2009 06 06 06 05 yes ah
that's we got in trouble because we
bought him the day before and we were
employees yes so you were running like
you were running webos 1 dot 0 dot one
day before they push that one that I
ought to to fix some critical bug I
don't know what it was did you by the
way do you remember did you ever look in
the in the webos debug logs like did you
ever look at the code all the funny
stuff that palm had to leave in the code
because they ran out of time no oh god
there was so much listeners if you can
find this out there I can't even provide
a link but if you can find it out there
some forum maybe it was pretty central
back then there's this great threat of
like guys look at all this funny stuff
in the code and the developers had just
been like these commented out lines
which were like this is really really
Jenky and a workaround but it's we have
to do this we'll fix later like it was
everywhere and the camera app and the
phone app is like this is really this is
a crappy user experience but we have no
choice if it's not
but would it be popular today yeah I can
answer that two ways would it be I don't
know what we want it to be absolutely
because a lot of us here pocket now love
webos and what it was what it stood for
everything about it um it can hardly of
webos part of webos or at least part of
the experience and Michael you're gonna
hate me for this but part of it lives on
through Android know it's true because
matias campus matias duarte is the one
who created the interface right or at
least help he had his creation he headed
the team that yeah so it was it was his
creation the user interface for webos
and and we're seeing a lot of that in
android now despite the swiping while
for the notifications from the
notification shade that was that's
straight at iOS wiping to close recent
apps and all sorts of things so yes um
in terms of user experience and
everything it would be easy to use and
and it was when we had it was a it was a
bit of a learning curve because it was
probably the first to use gestures like
it did yes it absolutely was he and I I
think that was a real big hurdle for it
and that's why I didn't get you know
we've had I feel like we've had a little
bit of webos overload recently because
well we had the anniversary today and we
did a little unboxing and then Adam now
has this touchpad go review up but it's
funny because this kind of stuff comes
in waves because just last night I was
sitting there trying to get away from
the internet and chirp an old friend of
mine from the precentral boards actually
tweeted I mean it was like hey check it
out sparkle to just got released for
webos and sparkles that game we were
talking about a couple weeks ago without
him on the show we're like it was the
one of the only good games the touchpad
had when it launched yeah and so I
downloaded immediately I got hooked on
it now sparkles of course available for
other platforms but the amazing thing
was that that 10 tons the developer
bothered to release it for webos like
it's it's like there's no hack it's in
the HP app catalog you tap on it you pay
HP three bucks and you get Sparkle too
so I stayed up late playing that last
night I was just bringing back all these
great memories of webos so you know I
think to answer the question I I agree
with you completely Taylor we all would
have wanted it to be popular web OS it
would be my contention though that
was not a victim of timing i think it
came along at a great time in fact as
I've said that before one journalist at
the palm pre announcement said that when
the web when webos was first unveiled he
looked down at the iphone in his hand
and thought that it may it webos made it
look antic ated and old and janki oh
yeah so that's something that that
really happened i think everyone pretty
much agreed with that webos was this
cutting-edge thing that was beautiful
but as we've recently learned from an
interview that i believe the verge no
somebody else conducted with jon
rubinstein maybe it was the verge or i
don't matter i can i missed it you
missed it yeah I'm sorry I can't cite it
properly right now but basically jon
rubinstein was like revealed for the
first time that the them getting into
bed with sprint exclusively was because
they had no choice they had a deal all
rise and they fell through they had to
deal with Vodafone that fell through so
they were stuck with sprint yeah and he
said that selling to HP was a big waste
oh right and that was a great great
quote he's like talk about a waste I
wouldn't have ever wanted to sell at HP
if I knew they were just gonna shut it
down you know and of course you know we
we can agree with that but I don't know
webos had some real big handicap stick
to adoption part of a lot of the carrier
deal hardware in was hardly hardware was
utter crap it was yes I liked the the
pre to me too so it was a lot better a
lot of people said that thing they say
like the pre 2 is what the pre should've
been like that's a cliché but it's true
that end and just an all touch screen
phone like why was that so difficult
because just like blackberry didn't want
to give up their keyboards neither did
palm and I ended in a fiery death uh
yeah it did and what was it the Windsor
knot is that the yeah the winds are not
as the device the all touch device that
never was like the pretty three without
a keyboard but yeah and we've talked at
him about that but you know regardless
of that you know there was a problem
there was problems with the software to
the pre to I remember seeing that for
the first time at an engadget reader
meetup in New York City back before I
did this before I was a writer I was
just a fanboy and I stood in line for
this reader meetup for like two hours in
the Sun and got inside and the first
table I went to was palm because they
had the pre to and it wasn't released
yet
this was right after they'd missed a
cycle so palm was still was not even
really in the news and they were like
yeah we're just you know we got this
pretty too and I'm like oh let me see
that and I would remember being amazed
at how buttery smooth the interface was
because on the pre you remember what the
initial versions of webos were not very
smooth no but two point oh I forgot what
they did they implemented some kind of
hardware acceleration and all of a
sudden it ran like it was supposed to it
didn't run like a janky POS and then
came the touchpad which was utter
garbage right like in a speed and they
repeated the exact same mistake and then
they like a week later they released a
webos update for the touchpad that made
it run great but by that time it had
gotten all the crappy press so minute
went on a fire so right and then there
was that and we had if we had all our
fun with a particular i got mine for
like 110 I got the the 33 big white /
164 what was it a bigger one I don't
know I got mine for 600 bucks on launch
day but I got mine then I went back to
the best site and and they they credited
made the difference because best buy was
doing that when they were trying to get
rid of inventory which was cool anyway
at the point is I just answer the
question I really think web boys had
some serious hurdles I don't know if it
would have been as popular people don't
want to learn things when you see a
device in the retail store that is
running a demo on its screen a looping
demo on how to use it and you can't use
the device without seeing that demo
because you don't you don't see the
gesture area like people don't wanna put
up with that they're like I just want to
go where's the icon where can I tap on
the AOL messenger you know where can I
have my mail circling back to iOS 7
that's part of a problem with it because
sometimes you can swipe left to go
backwards kind of like on blackberry 10
but other times you can't so it's not
very good at blackberry 10 because it's
inconsistent that way yeah there's no
visual cue saying hey you can swipe
backwards to go back it's just kind of
sometimes you can sometimes you can't
and sometimes those really bad things
like you know what though people are
gonna learn to do you know you know
what's not gonna happen people aren't
gonna buy a whole bunch of iOS 7 loaded
iPhones and then return them that's not
going to happen people are going to
learn it they're going to be forced to
because hey it's a iphone it's a
progression and it's something I touched
on when I said that we need to move away
from the photo realism and the school
Wharf ism that's why we're moving away
because people understand
you'll touch screen interface is now you
don't need a binding in a calendar app
to realize that hey this is a calendar
app right yeah sure yeah you don't need
animated page-turning you don't need all
this cool stuff because you actually
understand how it works all that stuff
is in there to teach you how it works
and after you learn it you don't need it
anymore that's what we went from photo
realism and skeuomorphism to this flat
interface that just kind of looks nice
clean and it works and you understand
how it works so so it's a progression
gestures will become second nature over
time and they will end right and thanks
to the efforts the pioneering efforts of
webos and then the the blatant sorry but
the blatant copying of that by by
blackberry with the playbook and which
is extended into blackberry 10 which I
actually enjoy using very much and now
with Apple kind of taking the reins as
far as new gestures go we're seeing a
progression of that that's nice and
we're going to talk about you I in the
next piece of listener mail so yeah
anyway let's let's let's move on thank
you for the thank you for the question
is an awesome question I think the point
is not in one of us knows but we wish
that we did know we wish it with webos
have been given the chance so we wish
this question didn't have to be exactly
exactly an awesome question though and
thank you yes finally we're wrapping it
up with Chris here's a question Taylor
will appreciate if he's there will he is
here hi guys I'm from Australia here I
have a question regarding mobile
technology in vehicles well greetings
from the United States and thank you for
this interesting question I have a
Subaru BRZ on the way practically the
same car as Taylor Martin's FRS and the
one major downside to it yes
congratulations indeed the one major
downside is the car stereo if companies
such as a sous can produce perfectly
capable fluid and responsive tablets
such as the nexus 7 for only a couple of
hundred dollars why does a basic touch
screen stereo cost over eighteen hundred
dollars as an option in my new car when
it is clearly inferior in functionality
build quality usability and
responsiveness why is it taking
practically all auto manufacturers so
long to catch up that is a brilliant
question that I've wondered myself and
before i bought my FRS one of the things
that i contemplated doing was mounting
an ipad mini which actually doesn't fit
in the space that the stereo is
replacing my stereo with just an iPad
Mini or not replacing we're covering it
up totally um and I still may if I get
this if I do keep the mega um I may work
on fitting something that goes around
the existing system and doesn't really
obstruct anything so i can quickly pop
it in place and take it out where i can
just drop my my phone in where this area
is because i just you I use my phone for
for media in the car mine has bluetooth
but yes I totally understand and agree
with you I have the same question in
mine I don't know if the BRZ comes with
the same bespoke stereo but what I have
is it's okay it works it does the job
but it has a resistive touchscreen a
resistive touchscreen you just use it
with your fingernails for fun do you
ever just bring out a stylist just just
yeah I mean I mean it's just like why
like that that is so right because it's
why I'll tell you why because it's
cheaper and they can they can make
better margins on it if they only had as
cheap as possible to produce and I want
to I want to speak to the price question
because I have two answers on this it
costs over eighteen hundred dollars as
an option in a car when an ipad would
cost 500 because the ketosis for HAMP
red it's one thing right well because
the car industry knows that it can get
away with it first of all because you're
you're already spending top dollar for
this giant giant expenditure I mean
you're unloading thousands of dollars so
proportionately speaking that's not as
much like well I'm already spending
whatever 50 grand well not just another
1800 sure I want the system second of
all and this is speaking as someone
whose whose girlfriend works in the car
industry and who doesn't drive because I
use public transit because I live in a
city where I can do that so I have this
thing where I don't like the car
industry because it is stuck in 1954 at
least on the retail side and I hate you
I hate that about it and I really I kind
of loathe the automotive industry a lot
but you can see it in America here where
many of the brands are struggling to
survive and some of them had to get
bailed out because for many reasons but
many of them also just refused to adapt
they were like blackberry they were like
these mobile companies that's it there's
like everything's fine what no we're not
going to change anything and then their
whole world collapsed eggs
what he meant in the car in the Carnes
yeah they all did at the same time right
right so I have very little respect for
the the modern car industry I think it
was a much more vaunted institution 50
years ago because it while it was doing
revolutionary really cool stuff but it's
iterative today it's boring it's dull
it's backwards it's its loathsome in a
lot of different ways so that's why they
can overcharge for a stereo system
because they can and because they're
jerks that's what I think I mean there's
there's some different technology going
on in there but yes no car stereos have
not really advanced all that much in a
better part of what two decades or at
least a decade hmm so yeah I totally
understand that question but you are
seeing some advancements where you know
like Apple announced you have iOS
integration in a car and ink our systems
are advancing but very very very slowly
yeah I think it's partially because
they're not tech companies right so you
know they're outsourcing all these
different stereos which is you know the
built-in stereo in mine is a pioneer and
in the FRS not mine but the FRS i think
is a pioneer stereo and it looks like
it's straight out of a nineteen ninety
five four trucks right so I'm what's the
analog here it's like when you see a
company like maybe there's a bad example
but Vizio like a TV a company known for
its TVs making this like one-off android
tablet it's like what are you doing you
know this is going to be cracked yeah
but why but the question is why not why
auto manufacturers are taking so long to
catch up it's why stereo manufacturers
are still building stuff like it's 1999
well that's a good very good point yeah
um also when I i should actually say
something i might one of my good friends
my roommate works for another part of
the car industry for another brand I
actually respect so I don't want I don't
want to kind of do mean the entire auto
industry that was unfair of me but I do
think that there's a lot wrong with it
and I think this is this is one of the
things now I don't know Taylor maybe
include this up I don't know if this
eighteen hundred dollar option that
chris seitz includes the entire stereo
system with like speakers and amps and
that stuff or if it's just the touch
screen interface it depends like in mind
the option to upgrade on the lot is like
seven hundred dollars so it's a
different price skill in other countries
I've learned that the FRS is a lot
cheaper here in the States than it is in
other places in Malaysia is the
equivalent of like 70 or 80,000 US
dollars whereas here it's like it starts
at 25,000 well it's like phone cost
share you get yeah people on the live
all the time tell me i forgot the
gentleman's name it is like yeah in my
country and I phone costs 1,100 bucks
like wow yeah well that difference is
like a inflation of like to this is like
an inflation like four or five I mean at
this point yeah diculous but still
that's a great point my upgrade option
for eight hundred dollars is a little
more justifiable but it's also still
like why does this cost eight hundred
dollars i had the same question and you
can get better stereos aftermarket for a
lot cheaper your stock options or your i
don't know what you want to call it your
your sales floor options what are
packaged retail what the car are always
going to cost more so if you go after
market and get a stereo you can get one
that's as good if not better for four
hundred dollars three hundred dollars
but even then that four or three hundred
dollars is nowhere near the technology
you could get in a tablet so the
question is why don't they simply embed
tablets in cars at a retail level on
like Oh Ian and some houses up in the
background some buses are doing that
some some airplanes are doing that i
forgot taxi cabs that's what it was yeah
somebody at CES got tired of the vocal
announcements in the back of cabs and
like like popped out the tablet or some
of them there's some some cheesy
knockoff android tablet just running
video in a loop that was wired into the
cat's stereo so anyway so we know that's
possible and Chris you know I I do I
think we have to close that but I do
want to thank you for writing in and
exposing that that interesting bit of
discussion we don't often get to on the
show and Taylor I'm glad you were here
too to help field it because I wouldn't
have known what I was talking about I
still don't as a matter of fact I'm
still complete
when it comes to automobiles my last car
was a 1990 chrysler lebaron so Wow yes I
liked it um i will say that Chris you
should totally look into some of the
videos on YouTube of people putting
tablets as in dash options you should do
one of those videos we should how can
now should have a video pocket I
automotive actually I've actually
honestly thought about building my own
I'm a pretty crafty person in my spare
time my dad's an engineer oh that's cool
yeah so so a lot of our free time was
spent building throwing things when I
grew up I helped my dad build barns and
buildings and electronics and all kinds
of stuff so how to do it you should
should happen I watched my dad build an
engraving machine one day so guys the
sky is the limit guys guys the think
webos the all about webos daily is out
