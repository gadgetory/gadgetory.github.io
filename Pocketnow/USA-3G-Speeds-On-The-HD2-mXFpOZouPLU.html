pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
demonstrate how the 3g works on AT&amp;amp;T is
network with the Telstra hd2 so as you
can see up here we have ATT 3g speed and
we also are running at hsdpa and we have
full service so I have a device here
that I'm going to compare their somewhat
similar in specs is the LG expo and it
has a 1 gigahertz processor as well both
of these devices have that the only
thing different is that the hd2 has a
little bit more ram so it might be a
little unfair in comparison to the 3g
speeds but we'll give it a whirl let's
see here when you go to Internet
Explorer the reason I chose Internet
Explorer to do this demonstrations
because it doesn't use a server based
rendering so it's going to be actually
the full data that's coming to the
device so we're both on Google right
here so I'm going to local pages let me
just get it into landscape mode so I'm
gonna load the pages so I'll be right
back ok so as you can see i have
pocketnow.com in the address bar and I'm
gonna hit the Go button at the same time
here so ready set go and we're going to
see which device is actually faster okay
it looks like the hd2 is loaded much
quicker and it looks like it's actually
done wow that was quick and the LG expo
is still loading ok so it's still
loading still ending of course this
device does have a little bit more ram
than this device and of course HD c
makes a little bit better device than LG
so let's try a different address ok so
I'm going to try cnet com and actually
I'm going to stop the LG expo because
it's still loading the pocket nada con
web page so I'm going to hit the Go
button on each of these devices
okay and as you can see the hd2 loaded
much quicker than the LG expo on ATT
hsdpa network okay so the last thing I'm
actually going to show is a speed test
on speedtest.net so i'm going to pick a
server let's see here see if my device
will actually recognize it's so close
okay so it looks like it recognized a
server in Bellingham Washington okay so
we'll just let it start up here ok so my
download speed was 2.56 megabits per
second my upload speed was 0.90 megabits
per second so this was just a little
demonstration of the AT&amp;amp;T hsdpa speeds
on the hd2 this is actually the Telstra
also known as the T 93-91 you can find
it on eBay or on any other website out
there it is from Australia and
unfortunately the connection settings
are actually locked with the original
ROM so you will need to hard SPL the
device as well as install either a
worldwide edition ROM or whichever wrong
you prefer thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
