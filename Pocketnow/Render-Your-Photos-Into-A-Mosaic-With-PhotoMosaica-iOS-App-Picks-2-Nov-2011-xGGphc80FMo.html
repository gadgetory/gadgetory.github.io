iOS app picks in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it if you like to go out but you
have a hard time deciding what to do
Alfred is a free application though on
the app store that allows you to find
locations based upon your preferences so
let's say that I wanted to view a
location that Alfred has suggested I can
just click on ideas and let's choose
something for dinner and click on there
and now you can show me suggestions
based upon what I taught him in the
beginning of setting up this application
if I like this one all I do is click on
here I can view the basics I can also be
the menu photos and what fans also like
photo Mosaica is a light and paid for
application that will allow you to turn
your photos into a huge photo mosaic so
that i can click down here and choose an
image so I'll just choose something from
my camera roll and now if I like this
image all you do is either crop it or I
can just continue to go draw on to this
photo mosaic so the more images you have
the more unique it's going to be so
here's my rendered photo mosaic if I
like I can zoom in and view some of my
images here I can also share this and I
can save it I can share it over email
Facebook Flickr and I can also view the
original pulse is a free application
veil on the App Store the large give you

preferences and what kind of news you
want to get so here if I want I can go
down to the bottom and I can view some
of the pocket now articles so let's just
click on this one it says custom siri
commands coming to the iphone 4s i can
view this entire article here and just
go back and let's say i want to find
something else if i want to view
something from The New Yorker and just
click on here so if I think an article
looks interesting i can save it to my
favorites by clicking on the star i can
also share with other people over
facebook twitter and email you've seen
any of those funny videos on YouTube
where they are between the news you can
do that on your iOS device now for free
so what this app does is we're just
going to tap and record i'm going to
read something really boring and it's
going to render into a song so now that
I've recorded my voice from a news
article I can just click play and listen
to the song if I version of that news
article
I can also go to re song and pick a
different song and I can purchase other
ones that are a little more popular so I
can share the song if I version over
email Facebook Twitter a song a fight
community and save it to my device ways
is a free navigation application
available on the App Store that allows
to view other peoples submissions of
their ways so here I can go to my menu
