pocketnow.com you're probably wondering
why I'm not in the sound booth like
usual with the acoustic foam behind me
and the gray pallor over everything and
it's because what I have to show you
today is too large to fit in the sound
booth deal with that so you know by now
that i bought a nokia lumia 920 today at
the AT&amp;amp;T store and then i also unboxed
the Nokia Lumia 810 so the AT&amp;amp;T store
didn't have a wireless charging plate
for me and I wanted to charge something
wirelessly and I really really wanted
awesome sound with my music while I did
that so i picked up the JBL powerup
sound dog and when I got home I had an
email in my inbox letting me know that
AT&amp;amp;T had mailed my free wireless
charging plate because that's how it
goes but this is very cool so we're
going to take it out of the box we're
going to see how it works with the Nokia
Lumia 928 very briefly and you're going
to get a sense of what this $300
accessory can do
okay so while we still have some
sunlight here why don't we take a look
at what we actually have in the box of
the JBL powerup box within a box the old
trick this is not very elaborate
packaging I'm just a bumbling fool two
boxes sometimes wow this thing is heavy
I don't know what the the actual specs
are on the on the weight but that that
is not a light device so that's the
device himself we've got nicely
compartmentalized series of cables here
instruction manual oh and then adapter
alright so when all said and done what
comes in the box is the powerup dock
itself and audio cable a power cable and
some documentation around back here
you'll notice some controls and some
ports on the back of the unit on the
left is the power on standby button is
the DC in jack for the power cable which
is plugged into the wall I just plugged
that in as well as a service track which
looks to be micro USB and an audio in
jack for that audio cable we showed you
I'm going to go ahead and press the
power on standby button and when we
press that power standby button we get a
nice light display showing the landing
zone where to put the phone and nice
audio feedback that the unit is turned
on and on the Lumia 920 which is the
example device we're using we're going
to go ahead and make sure bluetooth is
turned on in the settings menu and we'll
make sure that our NFC is turned down as
well it's under tap and send in the
settings which took me a second to find
once we've confirmed that we just go
ahead and tap the device in the landing
zones we bring the device closer you
notice the landing zone lights up which
is very very nice the windows phone
confirmation chime shows us that the
unit is charging that's very nice now
the units didn't pair automatically so
I'm going to go ahead and activate
manual pairing the Rio JBL powerup tells
us that is connecting and we are
connected and there's our confirmation
ping and because we don't have any music
on this device you have
just going to hop back into the AT&amp;amp;T
radio from ABC News there we are pistol
diamond trolls he come down reelected
and he said all along there's no
physical feedback on the volume keys
these appear to be either heat activated
or capacitive keys able but they work
quite well if they could tell way up and
finally because the NFC connection is
only needed for initial pairing and this
is not dependent on a near field effect
where we can take the Lumia 920 off of
the dock and the broadcast is not
interrupted finally you'll notice these
play controls on the right hand side
adjacent to the volume controls next to
the NFC indicator these allow you to
control the devices music player you can
get reverse forward as far as track
skipping and play and pause it does not
function with the ABC radio app that
excuse me it does not function with the
AT&amp;amp;T radio app that we are using
currently once we get this device synced
with their music collection will be able
to give this more of a thorough test
drive we've still got some testing to do
with the JBL powerup this is just a
quick look as we said before but at its
core this is a fairly simple product it
is a speaker dock that is heavy that is
big that delivers some pretty impressive
sound and that lets you pair your Nokia
Lumia 920 or your other Bluetooth
enabled wireless phone pretty simply is
it worth three hundred dollars well
we're not sure yet check back with us in
a few weeks once again I'm Michael with
