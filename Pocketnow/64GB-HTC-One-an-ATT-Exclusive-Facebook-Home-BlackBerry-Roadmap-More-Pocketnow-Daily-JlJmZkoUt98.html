for AT&amp;amp;T a facebook phone OS and even a
home pound gets more rumors and the
blackberry roadmap gets leaked I'm hi
meri behna and no nothing they were to
talk about today is an april fool's joke
sorry for the spoiler this is
out daily so the rumors started with an
HTC phone for facebook and then they
evolved into a facebook OS powered on an
HTC device and now apparently all we
have is a home panel or a home something
facebook home that's coming for android
and apparently it'll start with HTC some
people even think that's part of
blinkfeed but the point being is there's
a president on April fourth and
apparently we will be getting all the
goods here so stay tuned as we will
definitely be covering it then in hotter
news we have the blackberry roadmap
leaked them yes we have the z10 already
launched and then we have the q10 coming
in early q2 and I'm already confusing
you with the Q's there but then we've
got a tablet coming in mid-june probably
august i don't know but apparently this
tablet will be running blackberry 10 and
well it makes sense after the PlayBook
was pretty much a pure dud but then
we've got a you tent which is actually
bigger than the z10 and then we've got
in our tent which is bigger than the q10
confused already and then well the
interesting part is apparently that
aside from these devices being bigger
than their predecessors their displays
look curved so again this roadmap does
seem interesting to stay tuned for the
rumors and then let's talk about Windows
RT which definitely is hated by all the
media and even developers as well as it
hasn't really taken off but apparently
rumors have it that Windows blue will
actually be the project where they're
gonna merge Windows RT with Windows 8 as
this is a much smarter strategy than
trying to give you the option to have a
tablet based operating system that you
can't run applications on or that you
can run the legacy applications on or
that even new developers don't want to
build applications for again strategies
get better when those blue is definitely
what windows 8 should have always been
so far with the league so stay tuned but
hey we've got even more good news coming
over from Microsoft as an analyst firm
has just confirmed that Windows Phone 8
is now officially the third operating
system and I mean by third operating
system it means that you
though this is still a single that did
figure Microsoft that's actually doubled
in their market share and interesting
enough it hasn't even many market share
from Android or iOS it's actually in the
blackberry and Symbian and Symbian makes
sense because obviously those Nokia fans
are moving into Windows Phone as these
are the new Nokia's but the blackberry
downfall is kind of interesting so stay
tuned as to what happens to Windows
Phone 8 in the next coming quarters and
finally for the hell no they didn't news
of the day HTC and AT&amp;amp;T have just
confirmed that the HTC One is going to
be exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T in the 64 gigabyte
variant meaning that if you are planning
to get more storage on your HTC One
which does not have expandable storage
you're pretty much gonna have to switch
carriers and obviously this is most
likely for the United States as HTC
confirm that was in select area so
hopefully the unlock variant will not
have this issue but that leads me to the
question of the day have you ever or
would you ever switch carriers just to
get a specific phone in my particular
case I will admit that I did do it once
but I did it because the other carrier
was actually better in signal strength
and just about everything else even
technology so leave us a comment down
below will you ever switch just for
phone of course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in southborough make sure you
follow us on talking out on comment
