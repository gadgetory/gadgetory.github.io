now back with another throwback gadget
that will make you appreciate your
modern daily driver all that much more
so this time around I thought we'd check
out a device that makes last episodes
palm 5x look practically modern in
comparison the chart wizard oszi 7600
better known as the wizard 32k hailing
all the way back to 1991 this version of
the wizard predates the original palm
pilot by over five years although you've
probably noticed that it's classic
clamshell design is still being utilized
in the electronic dictionaries that
seemed to be all the rage in Korea and
Japan the first thing you'll notice
about the 7600 is its QWERTY keyboard
standard on many smartphones today but
considered somewhat revolutionary in the
early 90s in fact the first member of
the wizard 7000 series had a portrait
clamshell design meaning that it opens
like a book and featured a frustrating
ABCD keyboard layout that most likely
missed trained a generation of thumb
typists now they didn't call this the
wizard 32 because there were 31 models
predating it believe it or not this
personal digital assistant came
preloaded with the grand total of 32
kilobytes of storage memory but what if
you needed more than 3% of a megabyte to
store all your addresses and calendar
entries while the wizard 3032 had you
covered with this exceptionally large
expansion slot which in this case is
packin a full 32 kilobytes of flash
native storage
like the compact flash in SDIO slots
that came after it this expansion Bay
allowed the user to add functionality to
the device as well one could also
purchase a variety of non memory modules
such as a dictionary card and a variety
of games best of all the cards could
support up to 20 buttons which were
triggered by pressing on this plastic
covering worst of all a watch type
battery was required inside the cards
themselves making permanent data loss of
frequent occurrence for those of you who
remember a sitcom called Seinfeld
starring a comedian of the same name you
may recall an episode where in Jerry's
father distributed Wizards to fellow
condo dwellers for use as tip
calculators of course being a comedy he
actually purchased a lot of knockoff
devices with Mitch miscalculated tips
and led of course to some very comedic
situations now 32 kilobytes wasn't going
to stay the norm forever and Sharpe
quickly came out with smaller more
compact models with more memory like 256
K but that did not have the expansion
slot from the older models
much more pocketable and probably a lot
more stylish well that's all the retro
fun we have for you today good viewer
but please tune in next time as we take
a look at some of the devices which have
helped shaped our lives and the gadgets
in our lives thanks again for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
