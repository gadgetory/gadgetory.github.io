to see a completely bezel as galaxy as
10 at CES next year 1 + change the date
of the 1 plus 60 event because you know
Apple and Samsung is now working on a
laptop with a foldable display and we
wonder when we'll get to see one I'm
Jaime Rivera and this upload might be
late because internet speeds here in
what the Maya are not the best this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for the Lenovo smart display you
know and you don't want to wait for the
Google Home Hub then the source will
actually has got its benefits well it's
currently $28 off it's not a big
discount but then again this product is
so new I kind of think it's worth the
discount you can learn more about it in
the description now let's talk about the
Google pixel complaints because there's
no such thing as a phone without them
we've got people complaining about
things like the camera the fact that
they take a photo and the photo does not
appear in their camera roll we assume
that this is a software bug because I
don't know it's not happening to
everybody it's happening to nuts not
happening to me for example the issues
I'm having are with connectivity which
is the reason why we're holding off the
review as we get a replacement unit
we'll keep you posted on that as well
now let's talk about Samsung and laptops
we just saw the Galaxy book laptop he
announced recently with a Snapdragon 850
processor but see the company wants to
bring its foldable display technology
into laptops very soon how is that going
to blend into the design there are
patent images in the bottom that don't
necessarily look great but I'm really
looking forward to seeing what they come
up with s laptops do need your design I
feel now let's talk about 1 + s for
those of you that were sending your
calendars for the 30th well I was
already set to travel on the 27th and
now I'm gonna have to travel a day
earlier because well everything's been
moved
mainly because Apple had this event
announcement that's also gonna happen in
New York City so yeah the 29th is the
event what was this actually offering
certain compensation the people that
already had plane tickets and everything
you can learn more about it in the
description as well and finally the hot
news that they have to do with Samsung
and their future in design is the
company just revealed something very
interesting in a conference in China
according to them they've already got
the technology and that's
hi the speaker hide the camera hide
absolutely every single module under the
display and give us a truly bezel a
smartphone and according to the rumors
it seems that that could be the approach
for the Galaxy S ten not exactly sure if
that's gonna be the case but let us know
in the comments what do you think I mean
if Samsung would bring a display like
this next year on the galaxy s 10 do you
think that's what the company needs to
switch everything in its favor is in my
case I feel it is I feel that the
current design is already dated leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier if law wasn't
probably no comment subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one and follow me
on twitter i'm andras quo together on
instagram @ hi metadata please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw i'm how you met i think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
