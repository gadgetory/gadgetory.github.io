get leaked nokian AT&amp;amp;T already seemed to
be testing an EOS phone an HTC seems to
be considering being nice about stock
androids early adopters I'm hi meri beta
and thank God it's Friday I don't have
to be wearing these polos anymore this
is out daily Sarge day off with
the expected dues we all heard the
rumors that HTC could be working on a
Windows RT tablet for the future and
will according to new reports they are
discarding the idea and we don't blame
them windows RT has been a complete
disappointment to many almost everybody
and well it's been so bad that even
Microsoft is now offering touch covers
and type covers for free of you buy a
surface RT good move HTC now let's talk
about the white LG Nexus 4 we all heard
the company announced this device for
Asia a couple of days ago and it's now
available in the Google Play Store for
everybody else you can order it in the
same variance it's pretty much the same
device only will the white back and it's
the same price tag as well and you get a
free bumper of your order today which is
a it's a bumper now let's talk about
nokia n8 emt both companies are
apparently already testing the first
note get yo smartphone or EO s its code
name is elvis for reasons that i can not
decipher and well even though you're
getting a groundbreaking camera and a
xenon flash and everything that the
reports confirm well you're apparently
getting the same specs as the Lumia 920
and if that device is actually going to
be launched in the fall it's going to
have a year old specs 720p display and
everything else would you still consider
it moving over to sam's and we've got
some press renders of the galaxy s4
active now in grey and well if you look
at it from the front that looks exactly
like the galaxy s4 and honestly the back
looks a lot better than the plasticky
device that we already know now
interesting enough yes you aren't
getting some lesser specs on this device
like a lesser camera and everything but
so the fact that you're getting a rugged
phone and a prettier phone in my opinion
it's kind of what to consider but which
one would you pick and finally for the
interesting news of the day those early
adopters of the HTC One will apparently
not be left in the cold by the company
as
just confirm that they're considering if
they're going to be offering our Rob for
those of you early adopters to be able
to move into stock Android and turn your
device into a Google edition device it's
kind of interesting to see this move
finally by an OEM and if you think about
it it's kind of fair considering that
the HTC One is barely a couple of months
in the market but anyways that leads you
to the question of the day
hypothetically let's assume that you
don't get this rom for free let's say
that they're going to charge you some
money for it will you be willing to pay
for an official stock rom to turn your
device into a Google vision device in my
particular case of the price is right I
would definitely pay for it but then
again yes I know a lot of people would
say why don't you root it and get
cyanogenmod on it well the problem is
Santa gen mod is not really stock rom
and you're not getting stark updates
immediately so yeah the price is right
again I would pay for it but leave us a
comment down below what would you prefer
and of course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and topical make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com subscribe to
our youtube channel as well you'd also
