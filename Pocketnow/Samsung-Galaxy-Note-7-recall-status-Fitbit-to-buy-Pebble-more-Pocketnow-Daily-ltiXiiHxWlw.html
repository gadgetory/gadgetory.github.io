being acquired by Fitbit Google pixel
camera issues continue and this time it
seems your network has to do with it and
the samsung galaxy note 7 continues to
be shut down in certain markets I'm hi
Nevada and at this point in time it
makes you wonder why hasn't the note 7
been shut down everywhere this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals one phone that
we're about to review in liking a lot so
far as the ZTE exon 7 mini we already
review the exon 7 like that a lot but
this phone is actually going to find
some very cool deals as of December
fourth we're talking two hundred fifty
dollars or even two hundred dollars
depending on the color variant you can
learn more in the description also the
spotlight over to the samsung galaxy
note 7 as a yes i have returned my phone
you should do the same but the company
is still struggling we know that the
company has partnered with carriers at
New Zealand's now it's doing so with
partners in Australia in order for the
phone not to work in their networks
that's great according to news it seems
that Samsung is still struggling to get
these phones back so why not just do it
everywhere let's talk about the Apple
watch even though it has become one of
my favorite smartwatches of the year
believe it or not even though I hated
the first variant well it seems that
there might be some other design options
we are seeing patents of the Apple watch
in some series in a circular design and
we are big fans of circular designs you
can even say that the design of the app
shortcuts the app launcher looks pretty
much fit for circular design of anything
and we don't know how complications
would work on the watch faces though but
hey let's see if it eventually happens
now sorry about the Google pixel for
those of you that are struggling with
the hue issues on the camera which I am
to twist certain degree depending on the
illumination at night well we already
know that that might be fixed with a
software update we're still waiting for
it but even more interesting we've got
users complaining of this purple hue in
photos and probably the weirdest part of
this problem is that once you try to
replicate it with the phone on airplane
mode it seems that it doesn't happen so
it seems that it has to do in a certain
agree with network antennas it's kind of
weird we're hearing geolocation issues
there could be so many things but you
can learn more in the description and
finally the very interesting news that
they have to do with both pebble and
Fitbit pebble being one of the pioneers
of SmartWatch is actually not the first
one but one of the pioneers and Fitbit
being the current incumbent the company
that sells the most wearables in the
world we're hearing that apparently
Fitbit is going to acquire pebble we
know that pebble has been struggling a
lot a company had layoffs in early March
and even though we've seen some
successful Kickstarter campaigns it
seems that the company doesn't seem to
figure out its way so apparently this is
going to happen it's kind of sad for
some of us that are big fans of pebble
but it leads me to the question of the
day do you think that it would be a good
move for Fitbit to acquire pebble or do
you think that it should remain the way
it is in my case the problems Fitbit is
its closed ecosystem I hate that which
is not the problem with pebble if
anything pebble is the complete opposite
and that's the reason why I wish that
even a Fitbit acquired pebble the
Brandon its mentality would continue but
