now and this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup in which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it burglar alarm is
a free application veil on the windows
marketplace that allows you to prevent
people from running off with your
windows phone 7 device so in the
settings that can go down here and
change some of the settings so I want to
change the accelerometer to a more
sensitive and I can choose one of these
three alarms and I like the first one
because I think it's the most annoying
so now I have to do is go back touch
here are my device I turn it back on and
I move the device at all the alarm goes
off and the only way to deactivate it is
to enter your password in this screen
parchment tools is a free and paid
application of ill on the windows
marketplace that has many different
tools incorporating the one application
so I have a calculator here a converter
I have dice I have GPS which
incorporates into bein maps there's my
location also give me my coordinates so
just go back we have a level we have
list Morse code password generator a
ruler with a screen light which a
seismometer or so look if you want to
test some earth place just go back we
have a stopwatch a tip calculator and
also a scientific calculator as summer
approaches everybody wants to be out
there taking the perfect pictures of
their friends and family and whatnot so
this application is called photo Wiz and
there are two versions available a free
version and a paid version and what it
does is it gives you tutorials on how to
take perfect photos with a DSLR or other
camera that has other specs so what's
that I want to take pictures of flowers
here it'll show me the essentials to
take good photos of flowers and also
give me tips on how to capture photos in
different settings but jeez calculate
and it will show me exactly where I
should take the photo Harbormaster as a
paid for Xbox Live and also as a trial
and it's kind of similar to flight
control what you have to do is navigate
boats into these cargo ports and it's a
little bit different than flight control
in the sense that you have to unload
cargo and then also let's feed as
a little bit and you also have to
navigate your boats back out of the
harbor after they dropped off their
cargo load so the game continues on like
this and there's a few different maps
choose from and the object of the game
is to unload all your cargo on all these
ships before you crash into another boat
juice factory is a free game of the
little windows marketplace the oxygen
game is to throw a cleaver at the fruit
to slice it up so it will just hit
resume here and restart the game so so
for this level what I want to do is to
bounce it off of these pieces of tile
while trying to get the most amount of
fruit that I can and it looks as though
I got eighty-three percent so far and
there's a hundred percent so I beat this
level and I can continue on the next and
as some levels are more difficult than
others and this little block of wood
will stop your cleaver so this has been
another episode the windows phone 7 app
roundup and if you like our videos make
