pocketnow.com there's the video unboxing
of the HPI pack 110 just got my review
unit here it's a white box you'll
probably get some March from HP and
definitely not this let's see what I get
at least open it up in the flap here we
got a device right here it's real good
we got a 1200 milliamp battery small
really fit able nice you got some
adapters here for wall charging I've no
idea what this one's for get a European
adapter and then we got a conventional
Americas adapter right here real small a
nice let's see how this fits on the wall
charger it's a different concept of what
I'm used to seeing
that's real mate fit this out because
you fit this in here and it's a really
neat USB connector right here so you
actually have to use your USB cable to
connect your device to the wall and it's
a pretty neat concept different push the
flap and release it let's check the
device out right here mmm 3.5 inch
screen don't remember the last time I
had one of these it's this is a Windows
Mobile 6 classic device so we can expect
an only Pocket PC device you get the
standard buttons for a calendar start
menu button ok button and the you know
button buns are a bit flimsy though I
don't like that at all feels like if
they're gonna fall off you get a LED
lights right here you get a oh this is a
light detector reminds me of the old eye
packs you get a standard 3.5 millimeter
audio jack which is great this is
something I've really been looking
forward to standard stylus metal at the
field looks like if it could be good
much better than those spring-assisted
ones then the device looks metal and
finished but it's actually plastic the
bottom is rubberized which is good
feels like a good grip then we get the
standard mini USB connector here which
is great
gets rid of all those ugly HP connectors
in the past that would actually break
with time you get a microphone jack
right there get the power button right
here which is good I like this concept
you could actually just press it here
instead of having to use your other hand
to turn it on right there then we have
the audio button right here reset button
we got an SD card slot here which is
great so you get SDIO support there's
one good thing I was looking forward to
you get the speaker right there and then
you get the battery flap right here at
the bottom reminds me of those old toys
we had this little flap to get them off
let's get the battery on we go the I
pack sports Marvel PXA 3:10 processor
which has 624 megahertz of power it's
really good for a device in this price
range we're gonna be checking this
device out for the next couple of days
if you have any questions or any
specific thing that you'd like for us to
check out on the video reviews just keep
us posted on the forum I'm gonna be
towing it and hope you enjoy it and
that's it for the video unboxing of the
HP iPAQ 110 series Parker now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
