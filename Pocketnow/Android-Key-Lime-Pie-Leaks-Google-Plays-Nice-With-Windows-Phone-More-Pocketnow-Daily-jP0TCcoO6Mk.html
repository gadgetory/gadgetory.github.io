android according to qualcomm google
plays nice with microsoft and windows
phone support and the surface RT is
being returned like there's no tomorrow
i'm high memory venom and the game was
tied yesterday but it was a really good
game this is parking out daily
that's right for those of you google
users who are currently on Windows Phone
well google has a great to play nicely
with Microsoft and not kill google cig
next month apparently they're extending
everything until July thirty-first and
Microsoft is reportedly already working
on a port but this isn't seem like if
Google and Apple are both working into
killing Microsoft from competition and
for those of you wondering when the
galaxy s4 is going to hit retail stores
well a new zealand carrier apparently
already knows but the rumor is extremely
far-fetched Callie it'll be available in
the second week of April and that
doesn't make a little sense because
remember last year the galaxy s3 was
available I'm a third but still the
rumors so far fetched it's hard to know
so just stay tuned for the news and
we'll keep you posted and for those of
you wondering what the name of the next
version of Andrew it is well it's really
easy actually think of any pastry that
starts with a k and that's pretty much
the main and the only one left this key
lime pie it's kind of tough for Google
this time but holcomb is accordingly
already reporting that that's going to
be the name in their leaked roadmap
they're reporting that key lime pie is
coming and we all know that almost
probably happened in google i/o but this
is the first time that we actually have
a company leaking the official name so
let's see what happens and how well is
the Microsoft Surface RT selling well
according to new reports from IHS I
supply that were published by PC world
today well it's not going so well I mean
the tablet is selling below estimates
and according to them the return rate is
extremely high they're not providing
specific numbers but apparently it is
above industry standards so for those of
you Microsoft lovers that can't really
understand how things are going I do
believe that Windows RT needs to go back
to the drawing board and finally for the
hot news of the day those of you who are
considering the HTC m7 as your next
daily driver well you better start
considering a color we all know that the
event for this device will be on
februari 19 but new reports have the
device being retailed and sold on march
eight in three colors black white and
silver that silver color is going to be
really cool so now leads me to the
question of the day which color and
obviously are you going for them seven
first of all and which color are you
picking if you are in my particular case
I've had terrible experiences with black
poly carpet and so I'm definitely going
white this time but leave us a comment
down below are you going for the m7 and
which color
and if you want another scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure

tomorrow for our week's edition of
pocket net weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
