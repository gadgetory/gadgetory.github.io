logmein ignition is a paid for

puzzle game available on the App Store
so here we can begin by starting this
Rubik's Cube and let's that I wanted to
have a three by three I can select that
I can also change it to pictures and
have a weird crazy one one cool thing
about this is that we can change it to
be in a three-dimensional view if we
have 3d glass
and the cube uses multi-touch and other
motions in order to move the cube either
back or forth and up and down and we can
also go into settings and change some
things spongebob marbles and slides is a
paid-for game available on the App Store
the object of the game is to get all
these marbles into the exit okay so what
we want to do is to draw a line here
want to avoid some of that toxic stuff
so we'll draw some lines there and want
to draw a couple of other lines and now
we can just go through at this level and
once again all the marbles into the
bottom we can move on to the next level
so on this level will just draw a line
here and another one here and it uses
the accelerometer as well so click the
on button and move our little marbles to
the other side and then they reach the
exit so this is been another episode of
