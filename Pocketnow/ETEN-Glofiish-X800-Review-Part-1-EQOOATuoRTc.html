pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review of the eaton glofish x
800 in this video we're going to take a
look at the hardware of the device so
let's start on the front it fits nicely
in the hand it's a pretty small size
it's definitely bigger than the HTC
touch we have a front facing video
camera for video calls we still can't
make those in the US but if you're in
Europe you can we have two indicator
lights here speaker obviously 2.8 inch
screen diagonal it's shiny though it
comes with a screen protector that I
think cuts down on the on the shininess
and also provide some resilience against
scratches down here we have the call
start and call end key we have soft keys
GPS this is a launcher application that
I'll talk about later this is for the
start menu and here's an ok button and
the d-pad I'll bring this in close is it
looks like a little joystick and that's
what it is and it's got like a piece of
plastic on the top that's kind of shiny
and it's a smooth and you can press it
inward certainly to get it to operate
that way going over to the side we have
volume up and down it's slightly
recessed if you can see a profile shot
here this is for recording i think i'll
have to check that out later we have a
reset whole headphone jack on the bottom
we have the micro SD slot under the flap
the microphone mini USB good to see
something that isn't proprietary this is
the stylist right here on the bottom and
if we take it out here it's one of those
annoying little collapsible styli we
have the camera camera button which
actually has two actions you can press
it down slightly and then all the way
I'm wondering if this has autofocus we
have a power button here and on the top
it just says gps as this device does
have gps turning over to the back we
have another camera for taking standard
shots it looks to be a flash
self-portrait mirror and a speaker mono
speaker here it doesn't look like
there's two speakers behind there
and that is the exterior of the glofish
it feels pretty lightweight so that is
part 1 of the video review of the eating
goldfish X 800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
