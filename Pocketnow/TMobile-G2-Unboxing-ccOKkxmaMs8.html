and we've been telling me a little bit
about the g2 from t-mobile it's the
successor to the g one that well it's a
long time coming supposed to be out on
october sixth of this year but some
people are saying they're starting to
see tracking numbers come a little bit
sooner than that well today i got this
in the mail UPS three day and i think
it's the g2 let's go take a look ok so
let's unbox this I've gone ahead and cut
the side open here just to make things a
little easier and sure enough it's the
g2 nice slick box a little bit different
than what we're accustomed to with
android boxes this time it's got a top
half of the bottom half with a gap in
the middle so here's our side the bottom
with a seal right there the other side
the top again with another seal and that
then the back and i'm going to cover all
this up down here a little bit more
information on the the box than what
we're used to but i know you're not
interested in the box so let's get into
it open up the seal on the bottom and on
the top and crack the box open now the
first thing that we've got is the phone
now the phone looks very much like the
nexus one did except without a scroll
ball so there's that very reflective
screen feels really heavy in my hand I'm
impressed with the the weight that it's
gone sliding it up now you'll notice
this has a unique opening mechanism kind
of like the old g1 that kind of slid
around this one kind of toggles up and
it's spring assisted so it opens really
easily in fact I like it quite a bit it
doesn't get in the way it doesn't take a
lot of strength to either push it up or
down it's really nice it's got a little
cover over the keyboard I'll move that
off and out of the way and one thing I
really like these keys are staggered not
like on the epic 4g where it was all
in a grid it's offset which is great I'm
going to go ahead and take off the
screen protector on the front and then
it's got another one on the back here
looking at the back big branded HTC with
the g two on the bottom it says with
google down there this is metal the rest
of it is looks kind of like texturized
plastic it feels really nice it's got a
flash with the camera volume up and down
on the side and the micro USB port is
right here on the side to I like that
it's not on the bottom where it can get
in the way of being docked or on the top
like it is on the epic so that's kind of
cool over here we've got a little slide
button that looks like okay that pops
the battery out just kind of cool have
to remove that big battery let's take a
look at that looks like this is a
completely unknown size now there we go
1300 milliamp hour so not too bad it
comes with a micro SD card and that's
underneath the battery looks kind of
tricky to get out we'll have to come
back and see just how to do that in a
later video apparently should be an
eight gig and it looks like it is a
class two so not that fast but still not
that bad sim card goes right in there
and then you've got what looks like a
little microphone port right there
probably for noise cancellation bust
we'll see how that goes i'm going to go
ahead and put the the battery back in at
this point it big heavy battery it feels
nice it fits in very snuggly I like
having this brushed aluminum back it
feels really good in fact it snaps right
in and there's no wiggle room at all in
there so very very nice button right
here on the side looks like that is for
a camera push t-mobile branding on the
front capacitive buttons for home menu
back and search just like we're
accustomed to and then a little action
pad there doesn't feel like that toggles
up and down at all just that it you know
it might be a touch pad
we'll see we'll come back to that in a
later video hours on top along with the
little microphone and headset jack and I
think that's the whole device but it
looks really really nice feels excellent
in my pocket I forgot to mention the
microphone hole at the bottom but
compare that to the epic 4g and just
look at the sizes here it's about the
same length maybe a little bit a little
bit shorter in length looking at it in
width looks a little bit slimmer there
although just marginally if that and as
far as weight goes the g2 definitely
definitely weighs a lot more feels a lot
more solid and a lot more well-liked
it's higher quality in my opinion
sliding mechanism to compare the two
about the same but I do like the
mechanism on the g2 a little bit better
so there you go the unboxing of the g2
the long-awaited device by HTC from
t-mobile and we're definitely going to
show you more of what this device has in
upcoming videos so thumbs up if you like
this kind of video of course subscribe
to our Channel and for pocket now i'm
