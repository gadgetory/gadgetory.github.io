are you in a hurry to finish your videos
I have a life dude hey let's put this
out in the open your jokes are so
terrible they somehow managed to make me
laugh I'm happy I'm running out of ideas
if only world leaders were drunk as
jaime everything would have been perfect
and i have to agree with you they need
to learn from that that's right it's
that time of the week i am hi Natalie
that this is pocket now and this is the
pocket out daily recap for last week
monday was about Android 6.0 marshmallow
I asked you what do you think about the
name as google had just made it official
we had 872 comments we start with I'm
going to cook some marshmallow over my
new Snapdragon 810 fire pits at night
anyone wants and s mores and yeah I do
think that that would probably be an
issue but I can't wait for people to
start testing and probably the 810
issues get fixed or no I don't think
they will but hey who knows so far
honeycomb gingerbread jelly bean KitKat
lollipop now marshmallow who is coming
up with these names what's next pretzel
and uh yeah I never really understood
what's the point why not just call it
android end but i guess google has a
purpose for that so all these people
will get excited for android end but
about five percent will only receive the
update yeah I have to agree with you
that is the saddest part about Android
but not very many people will give it a
try Tuesday was about iphone there are
rumors of a 5-inch iphone that will
probably launch along the 6s and 6s plus
but this device will be probably sort of
a mid-ranger I asked you which one when
you pick out of all of these we have 612
comments we start with rocking the 5's
4-inch and not planning on getting
another phone until this one breaks and
yes the finest has turned out to be such
a good phone that a lot of people have
not upgraded and I don't blame them if
the features are not really going to be
boosted with these changes then why
change your phone I wish smartphone
should stay at a normal size which is
4.7 inch screen but also to be made with
a faster processor and longer battery
life seriously it nearly fits in our
pockets and dude you have met an amazing
point here particularly with the way the
industry is behaving we have super thin
phones but it's pointless if we don't
get the features that we really care
about so that would be amazing indeed
five inches is a great display size it's
big enough without feeling like you're
holding a license plate and I do have to
agree with you for me that's like the
sweet spot five inches obviously
depending on what you're getting
depending on the thickness of the phone
show let's see if Apple dust pull this 5
inch mid-ranger even though we haven't
heard any more leaks about this
Wednesday ask you how important is
smartphone durability to you we saw a
full test of the probable iphone 6s
chassis and its durability when compared
to the iphone 6 and the results were
staggering it was almost three times
superior we have 588 comments we start
with does it matter if when you drop the
phone the screen looks like well you
drop the phone and yes I have to agree
with you what's the point of us going
through the 7000 series aluminum if in
the end the display will still shatter I
think you make it a magazine point here
sapphire cannot come soon enough to
smartphones as a mainstream obviously
extra durability would not make me buy
an iphone success if I really want a
tough phone I'll get the samsung s6
active yet tough phone and ugly is not
really good combination and that's
really sad i miss the old actives from
sam stein doesn't matter i just hope it
doesn't increase the price and i don't
think it will increase the price we've
been dealing with these price tags for
the iphone ever since the iphone 3g
which is a long time ago so i feel that
the price points will remain the same
but if the storage options do remain the
same then we understand what Apple is
doing here we're just terrible Thursday
we discuss rumors of a galaxy note5
active that could probably be announced
soon and I asked you if you'd be willing
to wait for it particularly because of
the larger battery and waterproof design
or are you ok with a note 5 right now we
have 696 comments we start with Massa
4100 milliamp hour battery in a note
which is water assistant what else re
dictated Android lover could ask for
well you could ask for it to come with
the regular note and not have to wait
for an active variant that'll probably
be ugly at least the battery again
Samsung you did it with the s6 just give
us more battery why make us choose fix
the battery size on your phones and you
will have the perfect phone award and
yeah I agree with this I hate the fact
that we have to
news for an active phone that people
don't really want I mean why is it that
we can't get that same battery power on
the current and high-end model it's not
like if it's cheap Samsung does the same
mistake Apple did in the early 90s a
hundred different products and yes I do
agree with you samsung said that they
were going to tone down things they
haven't done so and even though this has
worked out for them well this year I
don't think it's going to last again
finally Friday the topic of discussion
was the Apple watch and the complaints
from users of the watch being damaged
particularly the Apple watch more than I
asked you what do you think that Apple
should do with this we have 366 comments
we start with Apple watch is too
expensive and fancy for nothing yes I
can afford it but Tim Cook don't deserve
my money and I do agree with you i mean
the Apple watch sport in particular is
not cheap for what you're getting so hey
it should be better than at least better
designed the materials Apple never had a
reputation for durable products is the
iphone for an aluminum macbooks their
products have gotten too delicate and
I'm sure the rest of the world or at
least a good amount of people don't
agree with that actually it's the other
way around it's because of these premium
materials that a lot of people prefer
apple products but those premium
materials are not necessarily durable
and that's what Apple is working on what
happens when you rush out to buy a first
generation product to just be like
everyone else you deal with the problems
just like everyone else and yes I do
agree with you it's the problem of the
early adopter and it's happened with
every single Apple product they are very
conservative with the first one then
they fix it it even though I hate that
it just makes you want to wait for the
Apple watch two and hopefully be
surprised that's it for the pocket I'll
