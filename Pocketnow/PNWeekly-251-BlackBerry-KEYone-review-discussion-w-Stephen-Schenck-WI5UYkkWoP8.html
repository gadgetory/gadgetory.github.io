I am super excited to introduce to
reintroduce to have the familial
homecoming of one mr. Steven shank the
man the myth the legend from phone arena
welcome back to the pocket now so much
for having me this is great been too
long too long I mean we've been bumping
into each other in trade shows and stuff
but I've really been enjoying your work
over phone arena I think you're doing
those guys super proud and just that we
can always point you like now that if it
used to be my buddy over on the baggage
I watched as the rookies all growed up
ah thank you very much it's been a huge
adjustment doing this whole different
type of concept over there but I'm
loving it it's great yeah I mean I think
you took the video really well man I
mean I always enjoyed our time together
on this podcast and I'm really happy to
see you thriving over there and and get
my face up but you know it's it's it's
kind of a head trip right
you know like I'm I'm putting myself out
there to tell a story and I need to know
what story it is I'm trying to tell and
I think that's kind of a sink or swim
moment for a lot of content producers
especially people who came more from the
editorial is writing to then shifting
over into editorial as video and so it's
why I've been so stoked especially for
what we have to talk about today yeah
very key one because I think you guys
produce I mean like I think all of our
audience would know by now there's an
embargo that obviously lifted this
morning as dozens of library reviews the
floodgates I chose were dumped onto the
internet but I really enjoyed your guys
commentary at phone arena I am I think
it's right up there pretty close to our
review yeah see I'm surprised everyone
seems to have the same sentiments about
this phone because when we first heard
about this we got some lovin a few
months ago peaks at CES saw more at MWC
and everyone's like okay it's you know
middle-of-the-road it's got a keyboard
but so what
but but how the reviews are out I think
more often than not people are changing
their tunes and like this is actually a
pretty solid little phone here to to our
surprise I was really expecting I'm
do you you kicked it off that way I was
really expecting a bit more pushback on
this notion of nostalgia or retro you
know rebooting a classic idea just like
we get cranky about rebooting film
series but really it kind of just seems
like there was a cranky article on
nine-to-five Google David Roddick seems
to be anti Hardware anymore dan I'm not
terribly surprised by that over at
Android police but on the whole yeah I'm
kind of with you I think this phone is
one of those devices that doesn't give
off maybe the most impressive first
impressions but it's definitely one that
I think benefits from a little extra
time and using it oh absolutely
yeah new hardware keyboards are
interesting I first when I got my first
smartphone it was a Motorola og drawer
you know the slider
yeah landscape orientation keyboard and
I thought coming from there you know
very hardware keyboard PC world I'm
gonna need a phone if I want to type on
the right one and I do want to I'm going
to need some way to feel like I'm
actually inputting text in a way that's
your tactile and familiar to me and it
didn't actually work that way right
because you know the using the thumbs
and tiny little clicks try wasn't key
travel it's not the same experience as a
keyboard and so then I was in this kind
of like middle ground for a while
waiting for software keyboards to catch
up but now they have I thought I was a
software man forever but this key one I
think it has been reconsidering things
well and I think it's important to point
I you know one of the one of the things
I really enjoyed in the commentary from
your videos is also just this notion
that it's okay for a phone to have a
specific target demographic or have a
specific audience in mind and to to
maybe not be the best all-rounder I
think we can both agree maybe this isn't
the best multimedia device surprising
outgoes camera but it's not really the
kind of phone I want to sit and watch a
movie on or play a bunch of games on or
anything like that but to then focus in
on the aspects of mobile communications
on getting to done on productivity and
really giving a compelling reason as to
why it's a good solution for that is
actually kind of fresh in a
where I think so many manufacturers are
trying to copy general all-rounder
success you know iPhones and galaxies um
I think that's opening up pockets of
these little pockets where a niche
success could actually you know if you
can corner the niche area like
productivity then that is actually a way
for your company to stand out from the
rest of the pack more than sport
activity though you talk about finding
an audience for a device I think Gizmodo
had a really interesting take on this
coming I think the perfect phone for Kim
Kardashian and they're not wrong here if
you're really into social media I don't
know
texting a lot o writing short magical
like and the camera you have this great
combination yet absolutely with the rear
camera and and I think what's funny is
like would Kim Kardashian benefit more
from having a really killer rear camera
or from having a better selfie camera
that has all the beauty filter luring
skin mannequin moves like I need to
distort my face so that no one can see
that I'm actually a human being who's
lived on the earth for a significant you
know a portion of time just smear some
Vaseline on the way is again it's such a
small lens I mean that's that's a really
accurate lens smearing I think you'd
have to pull off there so I wit while I
really absolutely want people to check
out individual reviews to see the
different counter points and I'm a
covered the main review for our channel
I was tasked with getting some of the
techie stuff out of the way like the
camera review and tomorrow we're going
to be publishing our audio review I
wanted to get your take sort of summed
up in a nutshell for people like I want
them to go see your review but if you
could share some of your experiences in
using this phone because I think it is
it's an experience worth talking about
with a little nuance because it's not
like every single phone that's going to
be released this year know it's a phone
that you know going into I'd expect this
to SPECT it to be a one-trick pony it
has a keyboard and you're buying this
because you want a phone that has a
keyboard and nothing else does but there
are a handful of areas where it really
excels and these aren't probably the
ones most people when they think about a
really
high-profile flagship phone look too it
doesn't have a giant high-res screen it
doesn't have the fastest performance out
there in fact it wouldn't be the fastest
performance if this came out a year ago
but it's got that keyboard right the
camera is is decent this is as a lot of
people have noted the same the rear
camera the same sensor that Google used
or HTC use for the pixel the software
processing is nowhere near as impressive
as the pixel does but still starting
from a really really strong place but we
haven't mentioned this yet if there's
one thing this phone one standout reason
to get this it's the battery life oh my
god I've got north of 12 hours like
nearly 13 with the screen on the entire
time and this is easily a device you can
charge once and then use it all weekend
and if you're not going crazy and think
about the things that consume a lot of
battery life a media consumption and
gaming which you're probably not going
to be doing a lot of with this phone so
kind of the use cases filter into you
with this great hardware the combination
of the 6:25 Snapdragon chip and that 35
hundred million power battery just like
the perfect storm for insane battery
yeah because I mean I I spent your your
scenario there spending a weekend with
it my very first weekend charging the
phone up actually getting all of my
stuff over all my accounts signed in and
I have a ton of screen off usage it's
why I typically don't really publicize
screen on times in my reviews is because
driving around in Southern California I
we use my phones a lot with the screen
off they're connected to my car computer
they're connected to my in - audio the
in - entertainment system connected to a
SmartWatch I mean they're constantly
pumping information around I just don't
have this run right and so from pulling
the phone off the charger on Saturday
morning at around 8 a.m. I did not get a
low battery warning until 60 hours of
use later yeah that sounds just about
right that's insane and so I can
completely appreciate where people are
looking to their phones as sort of a
total package idea and they want to have
the notion
of they want to be fulfilled like I have
the best you know like a Samsung or an
Apple I think can really sell this
notion of it's the best even if we
rationally know like not every feature
is actually the best on this phone um
while while we can point to some of the
deficiencies in something like high
graphics intensive gaming I did not feel
like I was really sacrificing much for
my normal running gun got to communicate
I'm plugged into social media you know
20 hours a day I'm shooting a lot of
content from the camera and I'm
listening to podcasts almost the entire
time I've got the phone in my pocket and
this phone never really seemed to miss a
beat it didn't really seem to hold me up
at all no the only bottlenecks I ever
saw occasionally some issues with web
browsing a little stuttering while
scrolling and I hit a few RAM problems
where multitasking apps you could see
them reloading into memory rather than
popping right out certainly the three
gigabytes of RAM is a situation I would
have liked this each that's the one
speck I think I would change 32 gigs of
storage and it's fine for what this is
and again the 625 I can live with the
performance because that is what's
responsible for this battery life you
totally as I would not trade that for it
and I can more rarely agree with you on
on some of the multitasking aspects like
back blackberry is so far removed from
this market that we've I don't know
about you but I kind of stopped trying
to organize my communication in the way
that blackberry used to back in the day
so for I think their solution I don't
think they're wrong I just think they're
you know it's something that people need
to retrain themselves is the notion of
the hub so I think the hub is very smart
so that you don't have to run up into
that RAM limit but that's not really how
I organize my thoughts and my
communications anymore and it's tough
getting back into this one window where
all these like tweets and Facebook
messages and emails accesses or that you
mentioned I just don't think that way
anymore
so this was the first BlackBerry device
I've ever used
so hub
this new experience because I I couldn't
I couldn't get into it I you know I'm
trained to get all of my notifications
from the the disparate apps that provide
these services and having them all in
one place I can see the appeal of that
but I'm just getting two notifications
for everything
I'm getting my Gmail and the hub telling
me the email is coming in I can see if
you're in the ecosystem why these are
appealing in bbm as well if you're into
it cool but if you're already an
established user of I know whatsapp or
even just Google Voice or something it's
tricky to find a reason to switch over
so so this phone but the great thing is
you don't have to buy this for all the
BlackBerry software and I think that was
what people were worried about we saw
blackberry becoming an Android based
platform they're going to sell this on
the value-add and for me there's not a
ton of value to the blackberry specific
software things the D Tech security
that's cool I like how it gives a nice
visual indication and easy you like
overview of your phone security
it doesn't really appeal to me but I can
see the users who it does appeal to yeah
I'm in that I'm in that ballpark I want
my star trek readout you know shield
strength 70% but that's not going to be
a main selling point for any no and
that's great because security is a
really complicated thing and making it
simple for someone to just get a you
know bird's-eye view of the situation
that has some appeal but is really the
way that the phone's hardware interacts
with the software that I love that the
capacitive scrolling with the other
keyboard that's okay it didn't it isn't
as smooth as I would like it to be I had
some issues with speed control it
doesn't feel you respond the same way a
scrolling on the screen does but some
tweaking there and it would be it would
be perfect I think now have you have you
so one of the frustrating things about
the way that we're always sort of ahead
of the curve whenever we have to play
with embargoes is it like the night
before all of these reviews were said a
while did you get the update did you did
you hear I checked I catch yesterday
afternoon and it wasn't available then
okay there's no I just got it this
morning so I checked last night and
nothing had come in I just got it this
morning and and I think it has helped
some of those little multi
tasking teething pains but I question
you know if you're a company like you
know Alcatel not Alcatel TCL and you're
working with blackberry on this and
you've got this embargo and all of these
videos are primed to go live
the next day why would you since it's
really who's this right because because
now it's like it one we already have
that conversation like this is up to
date on it on the Android operating
system it's got the most recent security
patch we're looking good for software
support I don't have the update it's not
even out for me and I'm happy that
they're being so proactive about pushing
out patches and bug fixes and things
like that
but if you really did just improve
performance you're going to have dozens
of videos going live that aren't take
advantage of this this performance
update which consumers will get when
they set up the device once it's
available to buy but consumers are going
to look at some of these videos and hear
some of these criticisms of like well
sometimes the performance is a bit
stuttery and then I call well I don't
want that when it possibly is fixed now
but you know yeah I mean this is all
very true but I can't help just looking
at the situation now wonder if TCL kind
of had a feeling that things would play
out as they did that people are going to
use the device for a while they're going
to appreciate the hardware keyboard
probably a lot more than they thought
they were looking love the battery life
and the raw performance isn't going to
matter so much and maybe they had a
little bit of insight they're like okay
yeah we'll have this last minute update
that'll tweak the performance but
performance isn't going to be too big a
selling point of this phone to begin
with so might not matter that much it is
I think it is definitely telling in this
day and age where we're not you know the
idea of a big phablet ephone with a huge
battery that gets reasonably good run
time um that for for all of the visual
characteristics of this hardware
keyboard that it really does seem to be
battery life which is run away with the
discussion as to the positives of this
phone I really enjoy this keyboard and
to your point I think one of the most
interesting things about the keyboard is
actually in the camera app did you try
sliding across the the keyboard after
focusing oh no no so I using the
bass bar shudders okay yes so I think
that's kind of cool especially because
you don't have to reach your thumb
around the keyboard yeah um but when you
focus and then you slide on the keyboard
it's this super accurate fine level of
exposure compensation so you focus and
then you're like oh I want the photo to
be just a little bit brighter and you
just scooch up on the keyboard just a
little bit and you can control the
brightness really easily and so that to
me was a perfect example of a company
that's doing a good job of actually
utilizing their hardware as opposed to
sort of apologizing for it you know like
I look at the Galaxy s8 screen aspect
ratio and Samsung hasn't done anything
to really maximize the extra real estate
you know the camera app is just a sea of
wasted space the best solution they've
come up with is you can crop into your
apps which cuts off controls in the
corners we haven't really seen anything
use that real estate outside of the
browser so for blackberry they've got a
problem where organ amelie it's this
clumsy reach around the keyboard or hey
you know what we can actually just use
the keyboard for a bunch of controls and
that actually frees up the display for
all of this stuff that we would normally
have to put extra icons or shutter
buttons or sliders or rockers yeah and
you know more than that I think it helps
overcome a a flaw with gives touchscreen
interfaces in general that we've sort of
been living with that hasn't been great
as it sliders are horrible to work with
exact if you ever try to set like the
brightness slider on Android phone with
any kind of precision it is maddening
because you cannot see where the slider
is when your finger is on top of it so
trying to get like pixel accurate
placement you cannot do it so having the
control the input separate from the
feedback on that input is it feels a
fantastic development Oh totally every
time I run like a battery test I have to
set the screen brightness to a specific
yeah you know Mike and most phones can't
get there most ones it's like I'm going
to move it just a little bit oh man I
just threw it 13 it's off I said like 20
minutes last night triangles with the
Equality 10 flaw exercise in frustration
and how oh man no seriously like the
slider on the p10 plus has like this
hard split where it's like like we heard
about a whinny err no no no % like no
one consented to have a said to staff
brightness it's so frustrating
uhm but I was pleasantly surprised to
see I mean you kind of get back to some
of the discussion resent about the
software here no I completely agree that
the hands-off approach largely rolling
with a stock interface with a couple
little minor additions it's a very
Motorola aesthetic yeah cuz realize a
design I think that this is really
played into the conversation of
whiz-bang versus core usage and and I
wonder what what do you think that we
can get across to consumers that this is
a viable option even if it's not the
sexiest or do you think the market has
already you know sort of bifurcated
between the Samsung Apple discussion
that some this might be the perfect
phone for someone but you know what they
feel safer going with and with an iPhone
do you think that this has the potential
to start chipping away at that duality
mindset you know any blackberry phone in
a recent history I think this is the one
to do that what the night of succeeds is
going to depend a lot on how the
marketing works yeah and I know that
TCL's talked about getting some carriers
involved in a Sprint's been mentioned
and that's going to be key to to getting
this into the hands of users also
blackberry has historically been the
phone verb
you know businessmen and getting the
right connections to give large
companies who deploy the phones to
thousands of employees that I think is
even much harder not to crack because I
feel like this ship has sailed there
they're not going to want to move
backwards into you know into the what
they were doing in 2008 and there's
going to be a lot trickier and I think
the price is also well it could be a
problem and I'm not if there's one thing
I'm not sure about with how those phones
release is how people can respond to the
pricing I look at it you know I'm
looking at the hardware and comparing
this to phones like
reason example the moto G 5 plus right
another 625 based handset that costs so
much less than this and is a really
really good phone in its own right but
you're not buying the BlackBerry key one
for the same reasons you would buy the
g5 plus I mean yes if the battery that
appeals to you you might consider both
but these are not going after the same
users here and I wonder if the people
who the key one might appeal to are
gonna be fine shelling out an extra $250
Wow another state allowed to realize
that's almost twice as much with the g5
plus is going for but right you get you
do get value for that money I don't know
if it's enough value though to throw in
customers especially when you can get
something like Galaxy s8 or an iPhone
for just another couple hundred dollars
more right but I mean like we've seen
psychologically that even that
hundred-dollar bump has this profound
impact on what people value or what
people perceive is value right um so III
have to wonder I'm with you there I have
to wonder will the bang for buck
conversation it's one that you have to
exercise nuance like if we're looking
against a moto g5 I think the build
quality on the blackberry is better I
think absolutely cereals is better I
think the camera is better the battery
life is just a teeny bit better with an
agar sure yeah well yeah but I mean like
I mean we're talking about like the the
efficiency aspect but they're both you I
mean yeah Ivan 6.5 but you have bigger
battery and smaller screen here so yeah
and so when we start you have to start
like check marking all of those
differences you know it's the same
problem I've had with the premium mid
rangers last year which is something
because something has a Qualcomm 820
doesn't mean that it's a flagship right
a phone is not just its processor right
but look at the sum of all because not
just all the components how they come
together what the experience they
deliver is but it's tricky because we
have with the pricing here the key one
is a top-of-the-line mid-range err but
then you look at the really really
affordable phones with flat chip level
Hardware from some of the other Chinese
OEMs and which do I go with you have to
ask yourself and yet you are ultimately
by this I think for the
keyboard there's no two ways about it
well and and I think that there is so
and this this is why I have such a hard
time I'm stuttering all over the place
because my brains trying to put three
different ideas together all the time
and that's what's so difficult to
express about a phone like the key one
is I think the the battery discussion is
actually one of the most exciting things
about this phone the keyboard is a nice
and nostalgic throwback and then I'm
also super appreciative of the fact that
this company seems to be way ahead of
the curve on support and updates in a
way that I've been very frustrated with
some of the big league players like LG
and Samsung you know waiting forever to
get security patches and bug fixes to
devices that are demonstrably more
expensive than this blackberry and so I
want to be able to summarize all that
but at the same time I also have to
acknowledge that there's a $300 phone
which is going to perform very similarly
you just won't get the support you won't
get the uniqueness of the keyboard you
won't get the battery life and it's got
a slightly nicer camera and music sounds
a little bit better out of the headphone
jack like that's that's tough you know
like I can already see all of my family
and friends their eyes sort of glazing
over as I try fix playing that stuff
when they want let people have thunk
about that out yeah oh it really is and
and also I worry that maybe also the
name blackberry I I'd be curious to hear
thoughts on this do you think that
that's a name which can recover in terms
of consumer mind share or do we think
that it's passe like if you were
carrying a board meeting where this
phone really belongs would people look
at that as being old fashioned or would
they actually be interested in the fact
that that seems to be a new BlackBerry
is this person a renegade or is this
person really a go-getter sharpshooter
getting it done kind of fellow
oh yeah there's definitely I think it
would be a prejudice against the the
BlackBerry brand and that you know much
like if we're looking at you know
Windows Mobile how Windows Phone
never sort of caught on they missed the
boat somewhere in the middle there to
get into the total another twenty ten
but I think that that Blackberry has the
advantage that there was never really a
bad blackberry like the company didn't
crash and burn on some horrible phone it
just sort of never really gave us the
really good phone we were looking for so
without any like very public failure
like that I think that it is possible
with the right marketing and their big
caveat there to to get the public's
perception realign to say that you know
blackberry we did great things a while
back we're still doing great things now
with a modern Android twist on it you're
acting a battery life like this with any
of your other modern flagships and this
phone will do everything that they do
maybe not in the same way or with as
biggest screen but you're not missing
out on anything by going with this phone
and you're going to get a lot too so
again this is going to come down to how
they promote this and how they go after
today's and in the smartphone users a
day or not people are shopping with
different concerns in mind and they were
when blackberry wasn't a day but if they
go after that and yeah I think there
definitely is a chance for the phones
and the brand to succeed I want to see
where this brings a blackberry brand
with our next big device is going to be
so what you're saying is that they
should spend a lot of money on fun
playful commercials of people dancing
with the phone you're not telling you
anything about the product or the
services I don't know if I'd go that far
but I think I would embrace like what
we're saying about this you know being a
good phone for social media and just
yeah on the go you know the gig economy
productivity you might not have a set
office but you want some easy way to
bang out emails great keyboard for doing
that on the go so I think use
modernizing the way you reach out to
today's customers this isn't the phone
that you know is going to be in your
suit breast pocket as your in your board
meeting with everyone staring down at
their laps clicking away on their their
BlackBerry's that's not the I mean I'm
sure those users are still going to like
this phone that's not cool blackboard
ECL needs to reach out to now yeah I
think that part of the conversation
especially with so many bring your own
devices policies going in at different
corporations that's definitely I think
going to be one of the most sensitive
aspects of whether or not this phone
succeed and
so I have to believe that their notion
of success isn't necessarily like oh
we're going to sell 10 million units in
the next month you know like crazy sales
numbers but can this can this
demonstrate to the public that this
company is making a course correction
because that becomes an underdog story
also alongside you know the the lineage
of support the the history of security
the reliability of these devices how
they last a really long time
blackberries are always renowned for
their battery life their efficiency um
all of those things I think are still in
the fog of consciousness from people who
are just a little bit like maybe closer
to my age maybe we're into mobile
electronics you know a little while back
but to chip away at what people are
really valuing today you know if I teach
us with Gordon Levitt drumming in a
subway for blackberry I'm pretty sure
this fights been lost it's interesting
you mentioned the age of users here
because you and I we've used phones with
hardware keyboards before but I imagine
there's a very large percentage of
today's smartphone users who have never
used a phone with a keyboard this was
not sold on their radar when they
started using smartphones and I'm
curious to see if there's any way to
reach out to them and convince them that
this is a viable option for text input
and I wonder people would get this phone
and just use the software keyboard you
know lose half their screen real estate
which is the right precious commodity to
begin with in the project but I do
wonder if there's a phone that's only
going to appeal to like maybe people in
their 30s on up will will teenagers will
people 20-somethings go after this
device you know I see in it it's such a
tricky concept because that's where I
get you see that's where I get most
sensitive about branding and names you
know the company behind this product and
and where there's I think always an
opportunity to disrupt this market but I
wonder if the BlackBerry logo will be
synonymous with what my parents used to
use as opposed to this could be
something you know sort of subverting
what
traditionally popular in this market I
handed the phone over to my wife and she
was a die-hard CrackBerry loser back in
the day like when when she finally had
to kind of give up on the BlackBerry
ecosystem that was rough and she was
issued an iPhone for her gig through
work and she hates it she can't stand it
she she's she's sort of an Android user
by default but I hand her this phone and
she's like you know she really likes the
build quality kind of reminds her of her
old bulbs used to have a curve too and
she's kind of flipping it over and it's
got Android so she's familiar with
Android and then I handed her the case
and it's got a big old to me logo on it
and she went oh that's a smart
partnership like all of a sudden you
know from this like sort of nostalgic
throwback the company had done one thing
very smart for her in appealing to a
fashion lifestyle luggage and bag brand
it wasn't that that changed her
perception of the phone it changed her
perception of the company that they
understood that that logo meant
something to business travelers to
people who have to walk into board
meetings are going to be judged the
second they walk in the door by the
briefcase that they're carrying or the
laptop bag that they've got and that all
of a sudden blackberry had done
something fresh of this time it wasn't
just a really nice blackberry case they
actually struck out a partnership with a
company that's relevant in sort of the
business fashion world today and so I
just thought that was such a unique
moment you know like I'm sitting here
trying to do a battery benchmark and
she's like oh to me see right this is
not something that I've you know looking
at this phone from specs from just my
from the user experience standpoint I
even forgot about the case I came with
one I didn't give it a second look it's
not something I normally think about
when they die waiting phones but clearly
there are people for whom this is a
important consideration is the ecosystem
accessories and and the quality of those
and how they add to what you get as a
phone that's not something that we
always think to look at
but you know also talking about the
branding and I was surprised I would
mention earlier or you were talking
about the great audio quality with a
headphone jack here the headphones that
came with this phone now I didn't find
the audio quality of our the headphone
quality itself to be super highs I don't
think it compares great to like the AKG
brand it ones with a Galaxy s8 but that
day you had you know different size tips
this is not something you always see it
tends to be a slightly higher end thing
it felt like I'm really a really nice
addition to a phone that he was
otherwise sort of mid-range II I really
liked the prominent blackberry logo on
the ends of the earbuds there just shows
that like they could have just had just
some glossy black generic looking
earbuds in here but they're really
embracing the little blackberry logo and
I think it speaks strongly to the
dedication to the brand here this is we
want to get the blackberry face back out
there let people know we're not going
away and that we can do more than just
we're not just about typing away I keep
going back to like businessman but this
is going to be a hard of image of the
company that needs a shake in order to
modernize their appeal and associating
it with media with you know Apple with
mobile devices even before the iPhone
really took off with you would see the
iPod you can see the iPod you saw the
white earbuds exactly and you got to
know Apple this is media you made the
connection here just having the
BlackBerry logo out there with the
earbuds it's a little thing but I think
it goes towards showing where the
company's priorities are Oh totally I
completely agree and also it's just kind
of nice when a phone is sort of properly
accessorized to use right out of the box
like I don't love I actually I really
don't like the earbuds that come with
Huawei phones but you get you know
earbuds and a snap-on case you have done
there yeah and an enemy like that you
open the box and like this phone is
ready to use
go out and live life you know you have
to worry about buying a cover case for
it and so that was a really happy
experience to get from a blackberry as
well I'm right there with you and I
think it's one of those things where
visibility is going to be super
important to see people using these
things out in public it was one of the
first times I was ever recognized
in Los Angeles was the first night that
I was shooting with the key one camera
and someone came up to me to ask me
about the phone because they saw I had a
blackberry and then they realized who I
was hahaha oh it's ridiculous on to run
like someone was motivated to walk up to
a stranger at 10 p.m. at the San
Fernando Valley while someone's pointing
a camera like a newsstand on a street
corner to ask about a phone that
actually motivated in interaction and
then you know again just kind of silly
like oh wait I've seen you on YouTube
you're like do YouTube it's cool um but
that like the phone was the star of this
interaction with this total stranger and
there's there still I think there is
still sort of a mindfulness or an
awareness there but you're absolutely
right it can only be helped and it's one
of the things that bothered me a lot
about the AKG branding exercise that
Samsung just did is that those are
Samsung earbuds manned by AKG I had a
Samsung Repp properly correct me from my
review of their earbuds where I was
giving them a positive review but
apparently I wasn't giving them the
right kind of um that that bothers me
because I'm a huge fan of AKG they make
some of my all-time favorite studio
recording policies not only head you
know I mean like we were neutral friends
of mr. Mobile mr. Mobile took my
microphone recommendation because I
thought it would pair nicely with the
dulcet tones of his narration that's
$1,000 AKG studio mic it's one of my
all-time various business studio
microphones I mean we really wanted to
capture something special in picking his
mic and so that label means something to
me if you slap that label on a pair of
Samsung gear buds and you're not really
disclosing the relationship between
Harman AKG and Samsung then I feel
you're sort of you know you're sort of
misrepresenting what you're getting out
of the box to pop open a blackberry box
and get a really respectable pair of
earbuds a really nice little microphone
I took a couple phone calls from
from those earbuds and the mic seemed to
perform really well and they've got the
BlackBerry logo in there there's there's
no confusion what you're getting here we
don't know who the partner is that maybe
helped them design those earbuds and it
doesn't matter they're blackberry
earbuds for the BlackBerry phone that
you just bought and they're built to go
together and they do that job really
well you know not to to change gears
here but I while you mentioned mr.
mobile does something I saw in his
review that I mentioned as well when you
versus getting hands-on with this phone
we haven't talked about the the
convenience key on the side here this
little shortcut spot and I left you pull
up an app or do some phone thing
how do you feel about the placement here
because to this day I go to power the
phone up or down and I hit the
convenience key answer to the power
button this button was not where it
should be no it's not um so this has
been a consistent problem that I've had
with TCL and Alcatel is that they put
their power button in the wrong way yeah
the power button should never be on the
upper left hand side of a phone it just
that's what will never look for it there
um so it's completely wrong I think on
other devices like the idol 4 and some
of the Detex some of the BlackBerry
detects the idea of this convenience key
a is a sound one I wish that this
worried
camera shutter button instead on the key
one because we also have a QWERTY
keyboard that you can program every
single key on it so what convenience do
I get from having another yeah on the
side of the phone this is one of the few
philosophical missteps that I think this
phone makes is blackberry and Android
together already means a significant
amount of feature overlap in how you can
customize the device between blackberry
services and Google services this this
phone can be tailor fit to be precisely
exactly what you want it to be down to
exacting the new chef so giving us this
one extra bit of hardware which is
hopefully redundant is just I think
unnecessary I think it complicates the
phone and I think we're also in an age
where a massive consumers kind of want
to be told how to use the phone they're
not necessarily looking to con yeah
that's the prop there's so much you can
do with it there's this yeah you're
overwhelmed by choice
you know the Android authority guys had
a great idea they matched a Google Voice
Search with a convenience key so it's
kind of like a big speed button oh then
we repress that in doing a little voice
search there that's pretty convenient
that's smart but also you know like I
can totally see see I want to try that
now I actually like what I would I get a
better benefit out of that the end I can
now also totally see the people in the
comments on that video going well why
not just use hot word voice detection
and use your okay gugugu and have your
phone recognize you're already doing a
voice search shouldn't it just respond
to your voice for a voice search to
initiate the voice search and I can
already hear the complaining people on
something like that cuz there's always
someone there's always more people ready
to complain about an idea then like
experiment with that idea I you know it
is one of those things like I know why
they put it on there and I understand
how it fits into the rest of the TCL
aesthetic and that kind of goes double
for now blackberry since blackberry
hardware is made by TCL but I don't use
it it gets in the way and you're
absolutely right it confuses my thumb
where I have to spend time with other
devices where that's exactly where a
power button would be yes yes is a
number of other phones and I you know
it's I just I don't have it set to do
anything it's not a thing that I use you
know I can see the appeal at least up
having this and the the keyboard app
shortcuts we're kind of a long press or
short press one of the the letters on
the keyboard to pull up an app that a
whole lot of possibility in there you
probably don't have enough apps on your
phone to assign everything but how do
you remember what does what and you can
make some mnemonic devices and you be
for your browser that makes sense
eventually you're going to run out
of those and there's an appeal to having
just one button that you know what it
does but then again it's up to you to
form that Association to choose what you
wanted to do and I you know for several
days and playing around with what's the
best thing to tie this to I wanted to do
Twitter or snapchat what what am I gonna
get the most value out of and I don't
know there's a clear answer to that yeah
and this also kinda just goes back to I
think your your comments in your review
muscle memory is really important and I
think it's something that a lot of us
maybe don't comment on as often as we
should I think so many reviews and user
experiences where someone says that this
isn't intuitive or this didn't work
right are really confusing familiarity
with a nominal experience right I'm
gonna head back down something else but
that's a close oh you have that by
exposure not necessarily what this
device did yeah right and so when you
were when you were talking about in your
review you know like using the hardware
keyboard is its foreign yeah it is it
doesn't feel right you do a lot of none
of the skills you've developed either
with you know hitting individual keys or
especially for use to any sort of
gesture typing does not translate over
to this and it's odd to not only be you
know hitting away on the keys use your
thumbs and swiping upwards - yeah for
the prediction it's it's it's a whole
new thing it's a whole new set of muscle
memory you have to pick up but it didn't
really take me that long before I felt
like I wasn't making a million mistake
it's still not on my speed probably
isn't like it is with a on-screen
keyboard but it doesn't feel far even
after just a week or two and I think
that's absolutely one of the things that
was a take away from me because I didn't
have to do the full review so this was
just my personal usage and kind of
coming to grips with um revisiting this
hardware keyboard I especially after the
Privy seal so much better put together
than the experience I had with my Prive
but just that notion of this phone
really does give off kind of a poor
first impressions if I give this phone
to someone like if I give this phone to
mine
mom um my mom had a texting phone with a
sideways QWERTY keyboard and now she's
she's on a galaxy and I know for a fact
that this wouldn't feel right to her
because she's gotten used to getting
things done on her galaxy so that first
time if I were to only hand this phone
to her and like let her play with it for
a couple minutes
this would feel like garbage he felt
like who would want this I don't want
this but if I were to take away her
galaxy and make her use it for a week I
think at the end of this week she would
probably look at her galaxy in a
completely different way in terms of the
things that she really values about
having a smartphone you know that's got
to be but horrifying for TCL though how
do you yeah telephone to people when
it's a good phone and you probably will
like I mean certain users will like this
phone eventually but how do you get them
over that hump no I see and that's and
that's exactly it is I you know this is
a conversation where even our us as
reviewers while we can dig in deep while
we can really examine while we can share
our experiences there's just so much
nuance that can't be conveyed on
something like this because it's such a
limited focus you know it's such a small
sphere of individuals who are sharing
their experiences with it and the
general consumer who might be interested
in it has really you know very few
resources or very few opportunities to
play with it and when they do I think
that initial the first impressions are
going to be great you guys stick with it
exactly and so that to me I think is
ultimately one of the biggest concerns I
have with this films I think it's one of
the most compelling devices of the year
I think this is one of the most
interesting phones I'll be able to play
with to review to counter review I might
do sort of a rebuttal video to some of
the things that Jaime was talking about
um but that's because I get to have a
conversation about a company which had a
specific idea and market in mind and
nailed the execution why I love the b20
I don't think the v20 is a great
all-rounder but it's a
content creation and multimedia monster
you know so like they did they did nail
exactly what they set out to do it's
just not maybe the widest audience that
they could reach and I think blackberry
is in the same situation here this isn't
going to be sort of the solution you
point to as being sort of the soft
around the edges friendly to everybody
phone but for the person who's
interested in a certain quality of
productivity this phone absolutely nails
it and I think everyone can appreciate
better battery life but you know that's
tricky because I find when people ask me
for advice on what phone to get I come
back with well what's most important to
you and they'll say something like I
want a great camera or you're really
pretty screen and see all the battery
life is super important I don't think a
lot of people go shopping for a phone
saying I want something with a really
great battery life and if they did I
don't know that the key one but
necessarily come to mind for me as the
phone to suggest I mean I mean on it
will not on for me it might but I mean I
would like your sylvans iterator II on
something more mass-market I would
suggest like looking at flagships from
like LG or Samsung which among those has
the great greatest battery life and
you'd have to like come out and say well
I want the phone that has a keyboard
that those still exist like any funny
you mentioned that I do and they're not
too shabby you know I think that's
really interesting though is is I don't
have that story of 60 hours of use I'm
not just like it was on for 60 hours but
I was using for 60 hours with any other
phone that I've reviewed so I was really
impressed with the mate 9 you know 5.9
inch screen four thousand milliamp hour
battery I think I can eat out two days
not two days and two nights but two I'm
up and I go to bed two days of use on
them I think now this is absolutely with
a bullet one of the phones that I can
point to the key one what if someone
were to say to me like hey you know what
like I don't care if I can play games
and I don't care if I can watch YouTube
videos I need something that can that
can last immediately you know I have
that that reference point 60 hours of
active use that I don't have that number
because I just
for granted on a galaxy you know like oh
it'll still be I'll still have some
juice left by the time I go to bed right
but I'll have deployment a day is the
best you're shooting for here exactly
and so now like I have this one talking
point um and and I also have the talking
point of the keyboard but I think you're
right I don't think people go into
buying a phone and considering like oh
well I want a phone that I know won't
leave me stranded but that's absolutely
one of the first things they complain
about yes yeah after they buy a phone
their phone doesn't have good battery
equal you know I I don't know if this is
something worth complaining about is it
an issue for you that there's no
wireless charging support here I've
heard people say this is not something
consumers want this is just a way to
sell accessories at the carrier stores
but it just would have put the bow on it
for me I think and I can imagine this
well but they're really really nice like
themed blackberry charging pads that
have the you know the fake leather on
there and the logo stamped in them it
would look really cool
but III agree that it would be a nice
perk of a feature but it's also it's
what I consider to be a perk you know
like having wireless charging on a
galaxy wouldn't have ever been a
purchasing Mounier ah what I like that
it's there you know but all where I miss
it when it's gone we're talking about
perks that we miss what about water
resistance I know it must have been a
nightmare to do with a hardware keyboard
but this has become everyone does this
and should you maybe be wary that this
phone is less durable than is
competition well in I think yeah
yes um so yes but I also feel like this
is this is an opportunity for
manufacturers to step up disclosure to
have conversations you know they're
there their focus on this phone was sort
of the rough-and-tumble durability
aspect kind of ThinkPad style yeah no
one ever just says if this thing isn't
waterproof you kind of have to listen
long and like wait why is no one
mentioning water oh but but I think
every phone should have a properly
disclosed IP rating so even if it should
be like a nutrition label on food
yeah and so so that would mean to me now
I know what I'm in for as a consumer if
you know the pixel is properly rated I
p53 I know this thing is not rated to be
completely submerged underwater and I
feel a company like blackberry should
really be at the head of a conversation
like that you're telling me impact
resistant glass and that it's a durable
frame it's it's ruggedly built it's just
all good Ronde and to get banged up a
little bit but what if I spill my
martini work to doodle yeah I just want
to know like it can I just kind of you
know shake it off and like be okay
or is this like I need to get this thing
replaced and serviced immediately and
that you're you're absolutely on point
there like I just need to know what I'm
in for
and I feel that's a bigger deal than
then whether or not it really is truly
like go swimming underwater with it kind
of a thing I would at least know what it
is that I'm in for but Stephen um this
has been a phenomenal conversation I'm
so glad we had you back to talk about
this phone sort of a sum it up for me
wrap it up you've spent a week with this
device you're feeling pretty good don't
know.some I am feeling really great
about this phone I am already moved on
to my next review but I'm kind of like
I'm having some withdrawal here and this
doesn't always happen for me where I
just want to spend more time with this
device and I didn't even come fully
around to embrace like I still struggle
a little with the hardware keyboard I'm
not as fast as I'd like to be but I can
finally see all the potential on this
device and there are really few phones
and I'm glad you have me on to talk
about this one because there's just a
few devices I've been as excited about
as this one and I think that that's
what's going to make this this phone
shines you get people using this they're
going to start forming their own stories
about the key one what they used it for
and they're going to tell other people
and the words gonna get out about this
guy it might take a little while because
like you said there's people need to
unlearn with their expectations from
other phones with hardware keyboard
mother BlackBerry's Ian and this Steph
has its work cut out for it for success
but this is easily the most exciting
blackberry phone eight years and one of
the like you said one of the most
exciting phones of 2017 so far right on
so ladies and gentlemen boys and girls I
would highly recommend
checking out the pocket now review of
the BlackBerry key 1 and when you're
done with that if you have some extra
time yeah you should totally check out
no seriously I think Steven you did a
phenomenal job in covering this phone
especially given because you know when
we had Evan on last week for the podcast
we kind of ran into that same situation
everyone's got the same embargo everyone
has to kind of push the same talking
points through the same loser process
over the same period of time but your
review I really appreciated the
commentary that you brought to it and I
thought it was a really fun discussion
for you guys to have over at Phone arena
so everyone who's watching this or
listening to this definitely go check
out the phone arena review of the
BlackBerry key one with our are awesome
Steven shank at the at the helm of this
review talking about productivity
durability and all the pointers knocked
out with this phone that that means so
much coming from you thanks for the kind
words you're more than welcome
I feel like just was like this is the
digital hug like you know back mutual
back patting because I loved working
with you man this was that this this was
a fun way to revisit that absolutely
again with the CEO
