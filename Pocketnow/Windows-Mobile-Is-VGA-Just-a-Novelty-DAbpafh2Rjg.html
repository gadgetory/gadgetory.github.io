pocket now calm and this is a video
comparison of a VGA screen with a qvga
screen of the same size on two different
devices on the right we have the X 800
glofish from e 10 it has vga resolution
so that is 480 across and 640 down and
on the left we have the glofish x 500
which has half that resolution if you do
the math the X 800 has four times the
amount of pixels then does the x500 now
if you don't know what a pixel is pixels
or the little dots that make up the
picture on the screen so the more pixels
you have in the same area the higher the
pixel density the clear of the screen
the more data you can fit on the screen
without scrolling around so we're going
to do a bunch of tests here to see if
it's just a novelty to have a vga screen
or if it actually improves usability and
makes the experience better okay the
first thing I want to take a look at is
how the icons look so I'm going to turn
on both devices close that and here we
are in the program menu on the X 800 on
the on the right and I'm going to go to
the what miss that program menu I'm not
sure if you can tell over the video but
the icons are much sharper and they're
actually the same if I scroll up because
each and devices have the same kind of
folders and file structure so if I move
it closer you can kind of get a get a
seat a feel for how these icons look and
then the x500 they're much more grainy
on the x500 than they are on the expo
800 okay let's do the same by going into
the settings menu somewhere I'm sure
we've all been many many times and here
we are now what's interesting is the
x500 screen is actually whiter they're
both on max brightness right now and you
would think that the better quality
screen would have a more vivid white but
that's not the case here so here we can
see the kind of updated icons for
windows mobile 6 on the on the right and
some of them are similar though between
5.0 and six let's turn that back on
so the icons are definitely more clear
no doubt about it now let's take a look
at pocket and format ate the best Pym
replacement in my opinion and in the
opinion of many and I'm going to okay
okay here we are in the same exact view
they look slightly different they're on
different days let me get them on the
same day so you can have a better feel
for what I'm talking about here and here
you can kind of get a feel for how a
higher resolution screen allows more
data to fit on the screen at one time so
here on monday i can see all four of my
appointments but on the x500 i can only
see part of three so having a higher
resolution screen lets you see more
without having to scroll I'm going to
change the view here I'm going to go to
day week view it's not very telling
let's go to the week view this should be
good yeah same same thing applies here
you can see more data on the screen on
the left on the x500 you can only see
about two and a half on Monday and here
you can see all three on the left on the
X 800 and certainly the text is is much
easier to read I think on the X 800 even
though it looks smaller it is smaller
but it's also a lot more clear ok so now
let's take a look how web pages render
an Internet Explorer I'm going to bring
it up in both and I'm going to go to the
favorites menu I'm going to open up msn
nothing too fancy whoops got the wrong
page there msn here we go and it looks
very similar nothing terribly different
the text is a little smaller on the
right you can see a little more but wait
there's an option in pocket Internet
Explorer on a vga device you go to view
and use high resolution and watch what
happens now well a completely different
story everything just got super sharp
and super crisp look at the difference
now so here's the x500 now here's the x
800
the text is really small yes and if you
have eyesight problems it will probably
be hard to see but for me it looks
really really good I want you to notice
something I think because of the the
intensity of having to use the
additional resolution and makes
scrolling much slower on the X 800 see
that compared to the x 500 which Scrolls
very smooth very smooth interesting
let's go to another website now we'll
stay in this high resolution mode will
go to pocket now calm the mobile page
and see what the difference is hopefully
it will spread out across the whole
screen there and it didn't let me change
the view to change it to desktop see if
that helps that looks better now we can
see everything and there's just a ton
more screen data here and again the
scrolling is a little bit choppy
compared to the x 500 which has smooth
scrolling and another place of the bj
screen really shines is with images and
video especially if they're captured or
recorded in a high resolution here's
just a standard picture that was
included on the device and we're zoomed
in at the same degree and I can
definitely tell that the X 800 has a lot
more detail on the picture looks crisper
and cleaner here than it does here I
think the colors look a little better on
the x 500 I think they look more natural
but as we discovered earlier the x500
actually has whiter whites than the X
800 and look how smooth that Scrolls
while this is choppy having to redraw
the screen and finally I want to check
out windows live search it's a free
application very very neat application
too and here's live search and go down a
little bit there's live search
okay it says we're in Atlanta Georgia
that's okay it's the default the X 800
is taking its time loading things still
not loaded there goes so the icons are
bigger on the x500 they don't scale to
vga resolution turn this back on on the
x 800 but let's go into map let's see if
there's a difference in map and yes this
is the default view for the map and you
get to see a lot more data on the screen
here then you do on the x500 so I'm
going to zoom in a little bit hint you
can also meet okay and wow look how
shoppy that zoom in was compared to the
x 500 which actually has a slower
processor but anyway i can see the names
of the cities because of the the clarity
of them over here on the x 800 on the
x500 they're bigger but also a little
bit more pix elated so let's go let's go
back to another option in live search
I'm going to go to movies so it's
searching for showtimes and of course
the x 800 is slower there it goes okay
looks about the same i think we get a
few more titles this ends with with with
Charlie Watson's war and you can see it
kind of on the bottom of the list there
I'm going to click on one of these
movies and it will show me a little
picture pictures look about the same so
no real difference here so let's go back
one more time this time we'll go to
traffic
and as with the maps you get a zoomed
out view which will let you see more
data on the screen so that concludes the
video comparison of a VGA screen on a
windows mobile device with a Q vga
screen on a windows mobile device we've
learned that in some instances having a
bj screen is indeed a novelty but in
some cases it's very useful like an
Internet Explorer browsing using a math
application looking at pictures looking
at video though at what cost the the X
800 has problems scrolling redrawing the
screen it may be a soft floor
optimization issue it may be a problem
with windows mobile and a higher
resolution screen there's not that many
high resolution windows mobile devices
out there so we will find that out in
the future that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
