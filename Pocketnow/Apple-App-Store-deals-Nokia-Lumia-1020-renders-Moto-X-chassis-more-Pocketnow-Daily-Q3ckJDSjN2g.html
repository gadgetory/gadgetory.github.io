with free applications nokia lumia 1020
press renders and first photos emerge
and Bigfoot yeah i mean the Moto X shows
itself in photos I'm high metal you
betta if there's one thing I've learned
this that Monday's get a lot better once
they're over this is out daily
that starts today off with the cool news
is Apple is celebrating five years of
their iOS App Store and love it or hate
it you gotta admit it's the biggest App
Store out there and it also offers
probably the best curated titles out
there even with all their hurdles in
just about everything as expected Apple
is offering free applications so links
in the description for full details on
what chapter you get for free LG is up
next as the company is now sent out
press invites for an event to happen on
August seventh in New York City and the
press invite cannot be more direct this
is all about the g two or optimus g2
whatever the phone is going to be called
and obviously we will be covering it
live but it's just interesting to see
what the company will bring to the table
at this day and age considering that Eva
happens in September and then all the
hot phone lineups happen in the fall I
wonder why LG does this so early but
anyways let's see what we get now let's
talk about that Samsung Galaxy Note 3 as
we've got some more leaks and now
apparently we will be getting three
hardware variants of the same phone and
well currently we have two variants of
the galaxy note 2 so apparently one of
these devices is going to be a lower-end
bone or at least in specs not
necessarily a lower end the vice per se
but as it turns out it will have a
smaller camera and it'll support an LCD
display so our biggest bet is that we
are getting the same typical to either
both us and international variants of
the phone and the third phone could be a
rugged galaxy note 3 that would be cool
stay tuned for the rumors and yes I've
got a segment today that's going to
torture you about the Moto X because
it's worse than Bigfoot when it comes to
rumors this time we've got some leaked
photos of the chassis notice it's got
two sim card slots could be that that is
the Chinese variant but still what's
even more interesting is that apparently
you will be able to swap more colors
with this phone as all you're really
changing is the battery cover it looks
all plastic and everything
and on the other hand we've got some
leaked press renders of the droid ultra
and yes it looks like a droid razr m
only it's got a new name and probably
better specification so stay tuned for
some more boring rumors of whatever
these folks are going to come out and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got some leaked rest renders of
the Nokia Lumia 1020 I know I said Lumia
909 last week I could probably be that
we're getting two variants of the same
phone we've got Joe Belfiore taking
photos of himself and according to the
data from these photos is the Lumia 1020
so it's probably again just one of the
variants now this device looks identical
to the Nokia Lumia 920 only with a big
camera hump and that's actually a cool
thing I really like that design but
anyways that leads you to the question
of the day is this phone gonna make you
consider a windows phone if you already
haven't in my case I'll be honest with
you all the windows phones that I've
gotten our review units obviously it's
not like about really bought one but yes
I really would buy this phone I do
consider that the Lumia 920's design is
epic its iconic I love it and the fact
that I get the added camera
functionality is something that I'm
really looking forward to so I really do
expect Windows Phone 8.1 plus this 10 20
or 90 9 plus the camera to be a big leap
and smartphone technology but leave us a
comment down below what do you expect
and of course is always for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone example gold mushy follow
