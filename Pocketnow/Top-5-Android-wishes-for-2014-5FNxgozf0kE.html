beloved operating system on the planet
asks for the numbers that doesn't
necessarily mean that it's the best
operating system out there even though
android 4.4 kitkat is probably one of
the best iterations we've seen yet again
there are a lot of things that should be
fixed so I'm hai meri beta this is
pocket now and these are the top five
wishes we have for Android as a platform
in 2014 number five is better battery
and storage options probably one of the
biggest deals with Android is that it's
always hit or miss sometimes you get a
phone with expandable storage and no
replaceable battery you're terrible
Barry life or the other way around or
even in the cases where these are
expandable you don't get really reliable
service or sometimes you get a software
update and this cripples the battery or
something goes wrong there's probably
one of the biggest deals with Android
the fact that OEMs have to tinker the
operating system and it doesn't
necessarily abide to the standards that
guaranteed good user experiences this is
something that we really need we need a
standard like for example hey expandable
batteries or expandable storage think
about the fact that you have a
smartphone that's capable of playing
great games and watching movies but the
fact that you can't really expand it to
take advantage of that because the
battery will die after the first flick
number four is better tablets finally
until this year we see some decent
tablets from Samsung but then every
other OEM hasn't really figured it out
as Suze is doing a good job with some
tablets not all of them and then we get
other tablet OEMs like Acer the do
terrible jobs with tablets and people
actually pay for these the biggest
problem is that people out there don't
know and this is really killing the
reputation of the OEM the fact that a
lot of the Samsung tablets aren't
available everywhere the ones that are
good at least and then we have the ipad
that's just doing everything right even
if it's not better than these tablets
again we need better tablets a better UI
probably not the flick down thing we
have on tablets right now or the buns
where they are it used to be great on
honeycomb at least when it worked well
which wasn't really all the time but
again the honeycomb you I wasn't really
that bad you should probably consider it
again number three is better standards
for accessories and this is one of the
biggest issues if you want to buy an
iphone case you'll see flocks of the
iphone cases out there if you want to
buy an iphone charger you see locks of
iphone chargers and you see other
accessories you don't really see this
trend with a
android products and the reason why is
because there is a big diversity of
Android products out there and then
there are problems here like for example
not every Android phone has NFC not
every Android phone includes a lot of
the things that some other android
phones that are good include so this is
one of the biggest issues with Android
the lack of standards you see this with
Windows Phone you see this with iOS so
I'm sure that there should be a way for
Google to standardize certain things
that will allow us to be able to buy
better accessories again number two is
we need more moto X's just better and
yeah I'm actually using a specific phone
for this and the reason why is because
the Moto X is a very interesting concept
first of all it's a customizable phone
but forget about the customization this
is a phone that's not too big not too
small it feels great in the hand it's
not really that powerful on paper but
that performs great you get immediate
software updates from Android you get
things that actually make it unique like
for example the way you could call
Google now which is greater Motorola
assist these are really unique features
that are actually useful the biggest
problem with Android is this bloat of
features that people don't really use
and again the cool thing about the Moto
X is that everything about this phone is
actually cool we just wish the camera
was better but again there is a lot of
room here to grow when it comes to
android the fact that we need more
reliable features from better phones
because the problem is obviously the
Moto X hasn't really become as popular
as it should be but again I know you get
my point there are a lot of things that
could be learned from the Moto X
especially the customization and finally
the top number one thing that we wish
would improve for Android and 2042
software updates they need to figure out
a better strategy we've been talking
about this this year last year the year
before and they haven't figured it out
the biggest problem is that everything
is left to OEMs and this is really not
fair Google should take more
responsibility figure out a way to
separate the whole Android operating
system from the whole UI of the OEM in a
way for software updates to be immediate
for these phones I mean kitkat was
designed to work on lesser phones and
yet the HTC One X is not getting it and
Google can't do anything about it for
you because they didn't sell you the
phone HTC did we hate the fact that iOS
works on the iphone 4 it's a phone for
four years ago and right now the HTC One
X can't get the software update
and Google should figure out a way to
improve their software update strategy
somehow and that really leads me to the
question of this top five what would you
wish would change for Android in 2014
what is your wish list in my particular
case honestly software updates is the
biggest deal we get modular phones but
we can't really figure out software huh
leave us a comment down below what do
