finally fix Android software updates
Netflix seems ready to pull the plug on
those using rooted devices it seems that
Google's assistant might reach iOS very
soon I'm hi Mary that and I do believe
that the Simpsons could have probably
done a far better job than the reason
Ghostbusters but anyways this is
PocketNow Daly the official news today
have to do with deals and let's begin
with the LG G six those of you worried
of the buy one get one free deals were
going away they're actually not t-mobile
is actually extending them the company
has confirmed there's nothing to worry
about the only thing is that this
continues to be a limited time offer and
the g6 continues to be one of the phones
that we most recommend in 2017 I would
highly suggest you consider also going
to spotlight over to the next generation
Moto X those of you wondering if we
should continue calling it Moto X 2017 I
love Evan bless he just came on record
to be like alright let's stop calling it
Moto X 2017 the name is going to be Moto
X 4 this is the 4th generation Moto X
apparently it won't be the flagship that
we always get given the Moto Z lineup
but we will keep you posted now for
those of you rocking rooted devices I
know you can do a ton of stuff with them
but apparently Netflix is not going to
be one of them as of the recent software
update Netflix is actually pushing
androids full DRM and one of the
requirements for this DRM is the fact
that it doesn't really work on the
devices so if Netflix is your thing and
you're using your smartphone with it I
would highly recommend you consider
giving all the recent changes with
Android lately I kind of don't find the
reason for rooting but I'm sure there's
a market out there that still goes crazy
over it now we are just a couple of days
away from Google i/o and one of the
things that we hear very loudly is that
we might be getting Google assistance on
iOS other line Google assistant is still
taking forever to make a full adoption
on Android not necessarily software
versions but the fact that we are
expecting third-party developers to take
advantage of it we are expecting more
languages to be supported but still it
is apparently something that's coming to
iOS now obviously it will most likely
not be something you will be able to
call on it'll just be a separate app you
can currently use strengths
action allottee of the assistant on the
google app but the app full-blown
functionality should come soon because
of course this is one of those projects
that doesn't talk to each other between
the google app and the grulla systems
anyways and finally the very hotness if
they have to do with Google's project
rebel and how it plans to fix software
updates
obviously Android o is going to be very
important at Google IO but it seems that
project trouble wants to fix the way
things are done with OEMs carriers etc
instead of the latest version of Android
being announced to consumers and then
everything happening backwards this time
the version of the OS is going to be
first sent the chip makers for their
code then it's going to be sent to OEMs
and OMS for their code then it's going
to be sent to carriers for their code
and until all these pieces of the puzzle
work together it's not until then that
consumers are going to know about it
this makes a lot of sense but it leads
me to the question of the day do you
think that this is actually going to be
the way that software updates are going
to be fixed because in my case I believe
not because certain OMS are actually
using software updates as a major player
for them to sell their new smartphone I
feel that that's not the way things
should be but hey it's what happens
