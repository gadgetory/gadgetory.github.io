pocketnow.com in part three of my syria
red fly mobile companion video review
going to take a look at the keyboard in
USB functionality i'm using my verizon
samsung i760 tethered to the red fly via
USB k first we'll take a look at the
keyboard shortcut keys on the top row we
have the HOME key which defaults to the
today screen the mail key which takes us
to pocket outlook an explorer key which
is mapped to pocket Internet Explorer an
interesting set of keys are the phone
call and end keys we can toggle the
keypad with the left softkey however
since there's no speaker or microphone
in the red flag you must use your phone
or a bluetooth headset to make calls hit
the n key and it terminates the phone
application in addition to the left and
right soft keys we have an ok key and an
LCD brightness up and down key will also
have an external VGA control key which
allows us to pick how we want the screen
output directed and we have the red fly
bluetooth connection key the other
shortcut keys that we have are on the
bottom row of the keyboard they are the
Windows Start Menu key and the red
flight configuration key the only
keyboard shortcuts that can be
customized are the home mail and web
browser keys click the ok key and come
back to today's screen
you can also plug in flash card drives
in the USB port i plugged in my lexar
jumpdrive unfortunately this is the only
kind of USB accessory that works with
the red fly which is really too bad you
can bring up file explorer and choose
removable drive to view your files the
red fly also allows you to use keyboard
pneumonic characters to access menu
items the pneumonic characters are the
underlying characters in each menu item
if you want to bring up explorer you hit
the start key and then the i key and
Puckett explorer comes up now bring up
word to show you how we can use the
keyboard to select text using the shift
key and we can also use ctrl c ctrl x
ctrl v like we do on a pc for copy cut
and paste although tight for my fat
fingers I found the keyboard easy to use
in touch typing mode the predictive text
functionality is the one that's built
into the i760 and it displays on the red
flies screen but I find that more of a
nuisance since I have to use the arrow
keys to select the appropriate word well
that does it for today's review and I'll
be back with my conclusion and my final
thoughts post on pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
