launches in q1 2014 we get a new
bluetooth standard that proves
significant enhancements and the
yotaphone finally gets launched even
though a lot of people don't care
anymore I'm high memory that I and all I
need now is an extra dose of coffee to
actually edit this video this is
out daily let's virtually off with some
official news as Google has just updated
their search application again and the
services now includes some interesting
enhancements first of all app
integration from the google play store
into the search feed so now for example
if there's something that you can do
more with with an application you can
install it from there and aside from
that you also get the option to actually
launch specific gaps after a search fury
like for example if you're looking for
movies you can launch the IMDb
application really interesting updates
let's hope they reach your phone soon an
interesting update is that now we have a
new bluetooth standard which would be
4.1 and the reason why this one is
important is because bluetooth and LTE
pretty much share almost the same
frequencies and this is to avoid any
sort of interference between either of
these bands and aside from that one of
the major enhancements is the fact that
now it'll try to reconnect itself
instead of having you try to reconnect
the products that you currently have to
do but obviously you'll have to wait for
a phone that includes this update but
it's great to see that it's up there and
for all three of you that have been
waiting for that dual screen yoda phone
with that Ian display in the back well
it's finally announced in Russia you can
buy it now but it's really interesting i
mean the company has taken more than a
year to actually launch this phone up to
the point where it's completely not
interesting anymore and still it's
available for sale now you can buy it in
russia still again we don't really think
that it's going to make a major dent
even though this technology is
interesting let's hope it comes to other
phones in the future and for more
interesting and odd news we've got new
reports of samsung's next gimmick as
they've just filed a patent for
transparent displays and yeah that the
idea is that you'll be able to operate
your phone from the back with your
fingers but we think this is more camera
technology it will tell you where your
fingers are and not really a transparent
display because if they figure that one
out then we'll have to see the gimmicky
transparent batteries that you won't be
able to swap because you won't be able
to see right and finally for the
interesting news of the day it seems
samsang is planning multiple launches in
q1 2014 which is really odd as Samsung
usually has their unpacked events and
they rarely ever use she has to launch
something or mwc last time they launched
the phone at CES was the Galaxy Note one
back at CS two years ago that was really
the AT&amp;amp;T variant not really the launch
of the galaxy note itself and then mwc
has seen just you know lesser quality
phones are not really flagship so the
question is what are we getting at these
events we've heard about the galaxy note
3 lights aside from probably other
updates but that leaves you the question
of the day are you planning to buy a
samsung phone in 2014 if so which one in
my particular case I am really in love
with the Galaxy Note lineup so much so
that I am waiting for the galaxy note
for whatever comes out but he was a
comment down below what about you frenzy

news earlier before this video is
filming sure you follow us on packing
out comment subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well can also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore to be better
