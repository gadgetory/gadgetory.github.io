going to do is click software tour of
the plum creek first off we have our
launcher you can do that I'm flicking up
from the home screen and we have our for
customer customizable icons and our
launcher icon at the bottom so first one
is the phone and if we flick up on the
gesture area here we minimize that
program you can go to the next here's
our contact here's your book scrolling
hook up like that we minimize it again I
can click through like this next is
calendar that's going to load our
calendar up here we have ability to show
different calendars from google or
exchange now multiple calendars they'll
have different colors there's one from
google and this is nice it kind of
collapse those free time to give you
know easier view of all the appointments
there's no your view that week day and
month this month
and wait for it okay it shows shaded
areas where you have appointments and
then my fat next is email come on email
there we go and this has nice unified
inbox that shows all the emails from all
the different counts based on when they
were received so that's good I got to do
a back gesture to get back to the
accounts and our different counts there
like to go straight to to mail
and open an email we have zooming
capabilities of the double tap or with
your multi-touch pinching stuff it's
just kind of a pain to do sometimes come
on
now i can forward this or reply those
are the commands of bottom now let me
show you copy pasting get our keyboard
out
you got to put your cursor in there but
we can't seem to do it there we go
all right well it doesn't work over
there but I can do it up here so I'm
going to get your cursor and it's kind
of difficult to now get an accurate
cursor insertion point with a finger and
then I have to hold down the shift key
and that brings me is some arrows there
and I can do a lot of swiping to select
the stuff that I want that was too much
there we go and now if I put my finger
and then do copy for Part C for copy I
copied it I put my cursor up there and I
hold my finger and press v that'll paste
it so that's pretty nice shortcuts we
got them also up here paste it like that
now that two of them
so that's that copy paste not bad kind
of difficult with a finger next is our
launcher and we'll show you photos
I got different sections wallpaper photo
roll all images so the photo roll is the
ones that took with the camera see how
those look rotates and zooms the double
tap or with your multi-touch now that's
fun
messaging these are text messages and
instant messages on aim or google talk I
tap that up here I can tap that and see
which aim google talk or text messaging
I want to use to reply so that's that I
go back this button shows our buddies
not online right now next we have music
music
so I go back
sometimes gesture doesn't work this is
really really great i love the shuffle
all button at the top I don't have to go
in here and find the artist I don't want
to order it's just straight away shuffle
all and it starts playing as i push it
goes to the next track that makes it
doesn't always do it instantly but that
makes it really easy to switch tracks
while you're in the car because we don't
have to look at these buttons time you
now what else is nice is when the music
player is playing you got this little
icon down here and you can still access
the next previous and play tracks button
is rather like to start playing again so
that's really nice i love that feature i
swear the videos
come on and this syncs with itunes so
pretty nice quality it's unloaded so
that's good
and also have notes memos
with a fun little graphic pushpins pass
these do sync with exchange unlike some
devices but oh no dismiss onions cars to
free up memory can't do anymore and a
close them
oh that one came back so if you run out
of memory you have to manually close a
bunch of these programs whereas you know
windows mobile will try to close them
for you unused ones Google Maps orissa
clock this is just the clock and you
have alliance
yep pretty basic
leaves are some programs that i
downloaded accuweather tweed but uh I go
to this side these are some sprint added
programs you got the app catalog let's
try that
and wait for that to load youtube amazon
that slowed come back to that app store
oh hey
and you can flick around here find all
these different programs to download and
same with amazon mp3 and download music
pretty good britt navigation is our gps
navigation program with voice prompts so
that's a important thing to have for me
out
so that will talk and this is a really
great package chillax my music this
place needs at the same time excellent
really quick we have some document
viewers calculator nascar sprint TV and
over here are the settings yeah yadda
yadda bluetooth I taken too long
settings are kind of on the simple side
but I think that can be a good thing so
we don't have much to do here because
too many settings might be confusing
complex so i think that's what the pre
is going for simplicity alright that's
enough for now with the software or
