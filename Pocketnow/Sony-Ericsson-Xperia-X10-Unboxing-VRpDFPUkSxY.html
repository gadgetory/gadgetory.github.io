now calm and it's no question that 18
tease android offering is fairly weak
while you can always use devices like
the nexus one or the samsung galaxy s
the unlocked versions you can always pop
the sim card right into the phone itself
and you're good to go with AT&amp;amp;T when it
comes to the phones that are actually
offered by AT&amp;amp;T it's not the greatest
range you'll have devices like the
backflip the HTC area of course you have
the captivate which is a great device
however now we're going to unbox a new
option that has just been released on
ATT and that is the sony ericsson xperia
x10 well it has been available overseas
for quite some time now it is finally
making its way stateside and subsidized
by US carrier so without further ado
let's go ahead start that unboxing and
see what we think
alright and we're back and let's not
waste any time you know yeah this guy
cut open we'll just dump the bag right
up the actual device is in just gonna
pull it out of the box right here I'm
going to get right to the unboxing all
right now as you can see right in front
of us we have the sony ericsson xperia
x10 the ATT variant of this device the
back of the box will give us some
details the typical detail is about the
phone itself as you can see here it has
the android OS with a 4-inch screen some
quick info about some of these specs as
you can see right here it is a quad-band
both UMTS and the gsm upgradable to 16
gigs of memory with the microsd
functionality and it's a 1 gigahertz
processor now this is android OS however
it's only 1.6 which we will go into
further detail later on and our software
overview so without waiting around at
all let's go ahead and get this guy
opened up here all right looks like we
have a great deal of manual information
here to showing a set up with the
battery in as you can see here lots and
lots of manual info there's also set of
headphones standard that sort of thing
kind of give you some information about
the AT&amp;amp;T service right there getting
things going but let's get right to the
beef the unboxing which is the actual
device itself quick start guide and here
we go the xperia x10 which seems right
off the bed much much like the x10 mini
living up to its name this is the full
version of the x10 go figure we're
actually going to pop the battery right
in get it booted up but first going to
put this aside enter so you'll have your
typical AC adapter with the USB that's
this is the AT&amp;amp;T version so it will work
in the United States and it's going to
you
a micro USB port to charge which is a
good thing many Android devices are
using that currently and lastly as you
can see here the battery is a 1500
milliamp hour battery so let's go ahead
and put our SIM card right in and we'll
get this thing booted right up we're
going to remove the battery cover I just
pulling over from the bottom here
there's actually a little groove I'm
going ahead and slide the sim card in
and the corresponding slot now there is
a microSD card included with this device
and just pulling out a quick glance it
is a 2 gigabyte microSD card and we're
going to boot it up for the first time
and just give it a quick look a quick
glance into basically what to expect
with this device the first time that you
start it up now that there Sony is
saying this is a high-resolution screen
so we'll see just how well the screen
performs against some of the other
options out there such as the galaxy s
and possibly the HTC EVO now when you
first turn the power button on you of
course get that haptic feedback
vibration we have the sony ericsson logo
and again this is very very similar to
the xperia x10 mini frankly because this
is the full version but phone is the x10
that is the full life like size if you
will about device now it seems like
there might be a slight ATT skin on this
device just at first glance with that
splash screen loading up there however
there may not be any conscience at all
we'll see what happens we do have a very
unique lock or unlock mechanism here
which actually swipes off into the side
and we'll have all this stuff just run
right from our SIM card and adjust the
network location all that stuff
automatically that way now at first
glance once again this is quite similar
to the x10 mini in terms of the color
and some of the icons while the x10 mini
had a custom user interface for what
they were calling one finger navigation
this is a much bigger screen at four
inches and it seems to be the full
experience what we're going to do is
we're actually going to put this device
through its paces as you can see here we
have the app drawer we're going to
actually put this device through its
paces give you a software overview to be
exact show you kind of what to expect
that if also going to go over some of
the sony ericsson custom software that
is used here such as the timescape and
the media escape apps as you see there
we're also going to go into further
depth of the hardware show you what the
device is all about in terms of the
overall hardware on the outside of the
device as well as what is inside making
this device tick and finally we're going
to wrap it up with our overview on this
phone so make sure you stay tuned for
the next videos and as always gives a
thumbs up thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
