comm and Nokia just released Symbian
Belle for the Nokia n8
it's a new operating system lots of
little upgrades and we're going to check
out first off we'll start with the
lockscreen which has changed a bit got a
different font there for the time and
everything is left-aligned so that's a
interesting change and we press switch
to unlock and here's the new home screen
now a lot has changed here we know I
have three home screens we have an
ability to choose up to six let me see
the little dots at the bottom to
indicate which home screen you're on so
you can swipe and see all the home
screens and it comes right back to the
beginning if you go too far and this is
a lot like Android we also have some
updates no longer are your widgets on
the Symbian screen limited to a specific
size you can now have all sorts of
different size widgets just like Android
of course and tap and hold and the
little X I can delete it remove that
widget tap and hold again and we have a
little menu come up I can add a widget
or shortcut or change the wallpaper
let's choose a widget here we can see
all the ones that are available down
here we have a marketplace button where
you can choose some more widgets
download which one was I going to choose
music player there we go and of course
you can add some more okay if you can
hit it right and we can move them just
the same as you would on Android
if there's room alright and one thing he
knows is this by default we're getting
different background images for each
home screen it's kind of weird but we
can tap and hold and obviously change
wallpaper and choose something from your
image gallery or whatever another change
is the buns at the bottom we no longer
have text telling us what these do and
they actually have different functions
now this one is the menu this one is the
phone and we have more cryptic
hieroglyphs at the bottom kind of
ambiguous buttons and this one is the
app tray well the application listing
and it's all one list now there's no
longer the top list with an application
button it's all one list that we can
scroll through but there are still
folders I just made that games folder
now if I tap and hold on this I can move
that to the folder and then I have a
couple of them in there I also have a
search button so you can find really
easily filter through the applications
okay
so this button down here still does the
same thing that also brings up the
application launching interface there
but tapping and holding on that button
gives you the multitasking interface as
usual one thing maybe a little bug into
the marketplace at least today the ovie
market store it was giving me some
errors see we got unable to connect so
at least for today I'm not able to
download anymore programs one thing I
noticed that was new launching the
camera seems to be very very quick you
just saw how quick that was seems to be
a little bit improved we have a slightly
different interface here others the back
button there's a menu there's another
menu and these scene settings is under
that a and there's your flash options
and your shutter has moved to the right
side and there's your switch for
changing to movie mode of course the top
button will still work and it seems to
do pretty quickly it felt a little bit
quicker than that before but I'm just
going by memory because I only have one
n8 here I can't compare ok so now let's
look at the browser this I was a little
bit disappointed in so I will show you
now let's start with some html5 tests
this is our standard fish ie tank
and you can see it does not do very well
not not good at all let's do another one
and here's something something
interesting the browser is identifying
itself as Apple Safari and well it
doesn't do too well with the html5 let's
go to a regular web site here we're
loading pocket now this is the desktop
view which I've bookmarked
and it is occasionally unresponsive
so we can see how slow that is
if you want to read a webpage it is a
bit difficult to say the least
ok not terribly smooth at all other apps
have been updated a little bit with the
new interface the new buttons at the
bottom there's your maps and something I
liked in the calendar it kind of scrolls
through these appointments so you see
that there's more they're nice little
touch now don't forget about the new
notification bar this upper area has
changed a lot from previous versions of
Symbian and we now can pull it down and
see your notifications missed reminders
new messages we also have controls
toggle controls for Wi-Fi mobile data
Bluetooth and the profile silent mode
which is good because you know
previously it was kind of complicated to
shut off Wi-Fi so that's just like
Android and iOS 5 now one thing that was
annoying I couldn't find the option to
turn on the power saver mode it doesn't
seem to be available anymore normally I
could go tap the battery and turn on
power saving mode and would get a lot
more battery life out of the device that
seems to be gone anyway overall I really
like this sameen bail upgrade it's very
familiar a lot like Android but some of
the widgets I'm not so sure that they
need to have all sorts of different
sizes it's kind of messy everything
looks out of place each which it has a
different design but it's a little
faster I love that the camera is a
little faster so that's Symbian Belle
give us a thumbs up if you enjoyed this
video and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
