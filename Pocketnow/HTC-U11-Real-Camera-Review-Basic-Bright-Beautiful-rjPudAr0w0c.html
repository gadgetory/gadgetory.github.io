aggregate score could be based on very
different individual metrics across
different cameras for example phone one
might get a B+ though it's disappointing
in low light then readers need to weigh
that against the phone which is awarded
of B - even if it's better at night than
the first phone this is why we don't
award scores this is why we tend to only
do group rankings twice a year this is
why we work so hard to show consistent
samples taken from similar locations I
don't feel the need to comment on the
claims or scores awarded the HTC u 11 by
other outlets those numbers will mean
something different to every individual
who reads those reviews we're here to
review a flagship phone camera which
arrives with high expectations in a
supremely competitive market buckle up
folks we have a lot of ground to cover
and I'm going to move pretty quick like
Samsung this year refinement is the name
of the game keeping the same resolution
slightly shrinking the sensor size
slightly increasing the aperture and
speeding up the autofocus the HTC
aesthetic processing the app layout they
all feel distinctly familiar and this
phone shows up with precious few
gimmicks starting off with exposure and
saturation the disclaimer for this whole
review shots from this camera are often
too bright in almost all situations left
to its own devices the phone will push
the exposure higher than it needs to
there's a desire in phone photo
processing to impress consumers with
juicy vibrant images lots of people
impressed by good colors on phone
screens the u11 takes us to the edge of
what we should expect from phone
metering that metering by the way is
center-weighted out of the box so bright
objects on the wrong side of the rule of
thirds will likely blow out when you do
rain in the exposure images are nicely
saturated blues greens and browns are
wonderfully represented skies have a
minimum of grain and uniformed sections
of blue warmer colors are always tricky
like the yellows in this dandelion
starting to clip detail or my favorite
Bougainville blossoms which sizzle
pushing into magenta territory
brightness plus saturation I'd like to
see a bit more color separation between
these pink and red flowers too
different varieties of these blossoms on
the whole white balance performs well if
airing slightly on the warm side and
this is lush in California daylight and
it prevents shaded objects from
appearing to I see nighttime photos
similarly swing warm like our creepy
gait augmenting the ugly security
lighting this is a bit thick but I
prefer phones which favor lighting
information over trying to find the true
scientific white of your subject when
examining dynamic range we get more
evidence of the issue of play with
metering normally we show if a raw file
can be recovered after purposely over
exposing by two stops and here's what
the u 11 delivered in manual mode at
plus two which seems really bright by
comparison here's what an S eight shot
also boosting two stops as the phone
meters we can't walk this back at all
the highlights are beyond repair
matching the s8 overexposure were able
to recover a lot more information lens
performance is upper mid packed nice
clarity a minimum of color fringing and
high contrast situations and often it's
a soft teal fringe which is easy to
overlook we see some flaring on street
lights at night and the light streaks
could be straighter and sharper but this
is upper fin track performance we get a
nice little piece of glass the u Elevens
minimum focusing distance is right in
line with the competition in the sensor
aperture combo delivers some gorgeous
bouquet like how soft the stop sign is
in the background or the scene behind
this baseball this is a solid macro
shooter likewise zoom performance is on
point plenty of resolution to crop in on
small street signs and the sampling
preserves detail well looking at video
HTC nicely balances reach against
clarity the scene is blown up and
there's some sharpening but this is
still perfectly usable much noise was
made about the improvements to the
autofocus and HTC should rightfully be
patting themselves on the back this is
snappy and fast right in line with the
pixel maybe just a step behind the
galaxy I rarely faced a misfire or miss
focus but I still maintain my gripe with
phones that show a positive focus lock
when the subject is obviously not in
focus I'm too close to this little
flower maybe I should have gotten a red
circle here justice
Estrin with center-weighted metering
users aren't likely to see much
difference when using the HDR mode
happily highlights are kept about the
same as standard pics so HDR here really
is just another shadow boosting mode
many test shots came back were I
wouldn't have been able to tell which
was a normal shot and which was an HDR
had I not taken the photo a precious few
Android phones really get this kind of
multi exposure processing right and
panorama stitching is better than
average a quick scan across you're
seeing pieces together a bold wide shot
but really busy objects like these power
lines will often get split up a little
patience will clean up most panoramas
we'd call this very good but not quite
top tiered image stitching and selfies
aren't my favorite but we still have to
look at this front shooter I guess a
higher 16 megapixel resolution than the
rear camera but we lose the image
stabilization found on the HTC 10 output
is fine but I found several shots which
were a touch soft for having more pixels
in good light of people have joked about
the mirror finish on the back of the
phone but it is really easy to pull off
a rear camera selfie and taking a look
at low-light performance this phone is
often working harder than it needs to
this is unnecessary to capture the feel
of a well-lit street scene we've also
mentioned how it exacerbates what would
otherwise be minor lens flaring so even
though we have a large image sensor a
fast aperture and image stabilization
the phone's metering will often push
this hardware to its limit
letting the phone decide means you still
have to hold still for the longer
shutter speed a light breeze can easily
blur your subject this isn't a great
setup for candid or street photography
signs get blown out and you have to hold
still enough that it's difficult to be
discreet again touch auto exposure makes
this shot easier a little patience can
lock in a great image and happily when
pushed to its limit the image processing
does a good job of handling noise
looking at some video when shooting UHD
the u11 ballparks around a 50 megabit
per second bitrate a nice high-quality
data rate but oddly there's a six minute
restriction on video files which is
pretty severe for a flagship phone this
you
a video processing resembles photo
exposure though moving images tend to be
a touch more washed out than stills I'm
seeing a few more dropped frames than we
would prefer but generally we're getting
a high quality video photos get a full
manual mode but video is pretty much on
the rails the only adjustment you can
make is this exposure slider and all of
this stays true for night video a touch
warmer on the white balance brighter
than it needs to be so expect the phone
to compensate by pushing the ISO to the
limit it's in video that we can also
check out stabilization the degree of
Correction is restrained over some
competitors so there's a bit less of the
jello wobble when walking around still
even when trying to hold steady we found
a few samples which were oddly twitchy
there are no options to control
stabilization shooting 1080p software
auto magically kicks in for a hybrid
stabilization I'm rarely a fan of this
dual stabilization effect for warping
the frame and shifting while cropping
but HTC handles this better than most
still I can't give up on that tasty
tasty UHD resolution HTC has always been
a leader in audio and that includes
microphone design new for the U 11 is a
3d audio effect on by default which is
pretty stellar excellent wind and noise
reduction great stereo separation and
terrific detail
one small issue in terms of phone design
HTC warns you not to block the mics and
literally show someone holding the phone
in the most gingerly fingertip way
possible so at least use the clip-on
case as this is a scary phone to hold on
to while over a freeway overpass no
settings in slow motion mode either but
it is 1080p you get a good one port a
real-time speed with solid detail it's
plenty fun to play with when warping
time and we need to talk about
HTC's app and camera performance this
shooter is lean and mean there's a
singular focus on the most used
photography features and settings and
very little fluff no fireworks mode no
snapchat filters no software depth of
field you take pictures you take videos
and you get a few core fun options like
panorama and slo-mo this app launches
fast and keeps you looking through your
viewfinder at all times it's
terrifically well laid out and will
never remove the user from their
composition window never no matter what
you adjust you can always keep your
subject in sight this is extremely well
honed from the stack menus of HTC past
yet we feel precious few omissions for
being so streamlined folks who want more
control to still get an excellent manual
mode there are a few concerns and
oddities however I previously mentioned
UHD video is limited to 6 minutes that's
a bit of a bummer on such a powerful tip
set a most photo performance is
screaming fast even HDR but there is
just a bit of a processing delay when
capturing RAW files the manual mode is
perfectly stocked with options but these
sliders are fiddly and can be tough to
read in sunlight so within that removing
your finger from a slider will often
change the value you're trying to dial
in obnoxious when trying to make fast
adjustments and tricky to use on the fly
all this space and the range of movement
from a 30 second exposure to a 2 second
exposure is tiny in three steps we get a
blown-out long exposure to way too short
of a shutter speed to really streak some
taillights and lastly we'd probably
recommend against using the squeezed
gesture for the camera introducing any
kind of grip change is likely to move
the camera at the last moment before a
photo fires
take a lowlight rear camera selfie easy
enough using the volume rocker not so
much with the squeeze so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us with the camera
on the HTC u 11 this is a damn fine
shooter with one small flaw I constantly
felt like I was fighting the metering
this brightness gremlin affecting nearly
every other aspect of the camera
pretty much every shot taken felt like
it needed an adjustment until I switched
this mode over otherwise this is great
hardware with fast consistent
performance and an app free of
distractions folks looking to focus on
getting a photo or video efficiently
will be well served it does lack a
little pizzazz though we're not dodging
gimmicks but a little razzle-dazzle
never hurt anybody
those looking for a bit more flavor or a
little more fun might find this setup
dry turning out great hardware has never
been an issue for this company but
sometimes consistently good hardware
isn't enough of a story to spark
consumer interest the shooter on the u11
is very good maybe even great with a bit
of polish on a future software update
but it doesn't take any risks as always
