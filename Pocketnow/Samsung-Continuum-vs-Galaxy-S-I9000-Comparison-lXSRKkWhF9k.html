now calm and in this next video we're
going to test the samsung galaxy s here
on the right against the new samsung
continuum on verizon wireless all right
now because both of these devices are
Samsung Galaxy S devices they both
feature the one gigahertz hummingbird
processor one of the most talked-about
aspects of the Galaxy S line are its
graphic capability so one of the first
things we're going to do is actually
give you a gameplay test we're actually
going to try out as fault five on both
these devices now pulling up the menu
we're going just to scroll right up to
the asphalt five icon we're going to
launch them both here now something to
keep minded is the trial version on the
continuum the galaxy s does come with
the full version the galaxy has already
had the full version running now both
these devices are set on automatic
brightness however you may see a change
or a fluctuation from time to time let's
go ahead and press the quick race icon
here and we're not loading at the same
exact time per se the continuum actually
started a little bit later because of
that extra screen the introductory
screen but really we want to do is just
compare the frame rate compared the
polish in the level of detail in the
game itself okay now they're both good
to go now it actually compares they're
going to be racing on two different
tracks but something to keep in mind is
we are just going to be comparing the
frame rate as well as just the overall
performance so the track selection
shouldn't be too big of an issue now
hopefully you can see this we will zoom
in a little bit we'll just try leans we
can see some of the detail here then try
and zoom in just a touch so you can
actually see some of the detail they're
both performing extremely smoothly now
one thing to actually see here is that
the ticker screen on the continuum is
still displaying while this is all going
on so it has to be sucking some of the
processor to actually power that screen
which may or may not be a good thing
I'll give both of these a boost real
quick and see how the boost
now the boost does actually work on the
continuum from the galaxy s you actually
get an effect as you can see there so
far I would say in terms of the
performance they're pretty much
performing identically they are
different tracks so it is a little tough
to compare the environment but both
environments look extremely detailed the
cars look very nice the car on the
Galaxy S does appear to be a little more
polished almost a little more detailed
which we know in the back portion on
with it's tough to tell but in the
actual back portion of the car you can
see little bit more detail on the galaxy
s it is a bigger screen than on the
galaxy s as well so that will help
contribute to that factor overall though
it seems like a win-win here now
something to keep in mind here is that
the samsung galaxy s the full unlocked
version here on the right is running
froyo or as a continuum is running
android 2.1 so things would tell you
that the odds would lean in the unlocked
full galaxy s's favor simply because of
that just-in-time compiler in the
further frame improvements now the next
test we're going to test up the browser
speed we're going to navigate to pocket
now calm and see which one is able to
load faster so we're going to pull up
the browser first and now we're going to
do is just type in pocket now calm okay
now we've typed in pocket now come on
both these devices now you're probably
noticing the different keyboard on the
Samsung Galaxy S we're actually using a
custom keyboard there we will actually
show you a side-by-side comparison
though with the default Samsung keyboard
we're after this test but for now let's
go ahead and press go and we'll see
which one is able to load pocketnow.com
faster
alright and it seems as though the
continuum was actually able to pull up
the mobile version faster what we're
going to do though is pull up the
desktop version of the site so we're
going to scroll down on the bottom on
both of these and we're going to go
ahead and select the desktop option
let's go ahead and select that now and
wow it looks like the continuum is still
going to win it is definitely further
along however they are kind of holding
up toward the very end of that progress
bar alright continuum one what it looks
like the galaxy s just crashed ouch
considering I had froyo and a better
browser ouch now something to keep in
mind are these both have the same
processor the galaxy s has more ram that
then they continue them but they do have
the same resolution but with that being
said there may be something involved
with the galaxy s here on the right
having to actually fill in the entire 4
inch screen whereas the continuum has
that smaller screens that may contribute
to that faster processing overall though
we have to say that general navigation
with the continuing through the UI is
very snappy there seems to be a few
hiccups here and there and that's most
likely because of the second ticker down
here the fact that it actually
contribute some of its processor to
power that ticker screen now next up
we're going to test the YouTube load
speed now something we haven't mentioned
these are both on the same exact
wireless network so there really is no
speed difference with loading whatsoever
but now we're going to up and pull up a
pocket now YouTube video via the YouTube
application so now just launching the
actual application we'll see which one
is a little faster to pull up the
application itself and it seems like the
Continuum's digitizer is actually a
little faster to possibly respond to the
finger input as you saw there to
actually recognize the the touch faster
so that may have something to do with
the YouTube application opening faster
alright so we've now gone ahead and
typed in pocket now and it's property
pocket now video so we're going ahead
and press that shortcut and we're going
to pick the same exact video which will
be the windows phone 7 here on the top
versus the zune HD and we'll see which
one's faster turn them both sideways
alright so let's look the galaxy s did
pull this one up a little faster now
you're probably hearing a big volume
difference right now and that's going to
be because of the fact that the
continuum actually has stereo speakers
so we're going to pause these videos
will actually give you an up-close look
at those but in terms of the actual
display here they're going to look
practically identical they do have both
a super amoled display the same
resolution that sort of thing be able to
hear the sound so the galaxy are the
continuum here we have a speaker on the
left and speaker on the right where's in
the galaxy s we just have the one
speaker so there usually is a very very
large volume difference there now we
have had some stutter on the continuum
here when this YouTube application it
almost seems like it's having a tough
time buffering the video or keeping up
it's definitely locking up a little more
on the continuum that it is on the
actual galaxy s alright so we've now
actually open up the messaging
applications so you can see the two
differences in the keyboards that have
fault keyboards that Samsung and Android
provide here now this is the continuum
keyboard here on the left and this is
the samsung galaxy s here on the right
now as you'll see the galaxy s
definitely has more space and that's
because of the larger 4-inch screen but
either way the key setup is practically
the same you're going to have your voice
input button but with that being said
the continuum is very accurate in the
text prediction as well as the text
correction is once again also very
accurate at the end of the day what we
have here are two great devices in terms
of these software they both can battle
it out they both can practically keep up
with one another they're both going to
have their strengths as well as their
weaknesses for example the continuum
will have a smaller screen but it will
offer you that secondary ticker screen
whereas the Galaxy S will have a bigger
screen but it's only one either way you
can't lose when picking any of the
galaxy s line of devices if you like
this video please stay tuned for our
next and final review and final word on
the samsung continuum please give this
video a thumbs up and as always thank
you very much for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
