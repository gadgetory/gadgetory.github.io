pocketnow.com and today we're going to
be taking a look at the software
component of the verizon samsung
fascinate which is so we've told you
many times before their version of
samsung's galaxy s so stay tuned welcome
back to the samsung fascinate software
tour first thing we're going to do is do
it up so you can see what it looks like
when it goes through its initial startup
process so there you have the samsung
logo followed by the galaxy s animation
then of course some verizon wireless
animation it's a little stuttery
considering 1 gigahertz processor in
here and this is what the phone is going
to look like exactly when you turn it on
for the first time it defaults to the
puzzle lock screen which some may prefer
some people would rather have the
sliding glass one that's an option which
as you've seen on the unlocked versions
and some of the other variants as well
lets you just slide the screen all the
way in any direction to unlock it but
anyway this is exactly how it's going to
look when you first turn it on and
probably the most noticeable change to
this model is the inclusion of bing as
you can see right there microsoft struck
struck a deal with verizon putting bing
on many of their phones and so we have
it embedded pretty deeply here this is
the regular bing application then we
also have a bing search bar up here and
below we have the Bing Maps separate
application along with obviously VZ
navigation if you choose to go the pay
route so here we'll go to the Bing Maps
application service agreement and
location services except usually
location allow because we're inside here
we're going to
a lot of trouble getting any sort of
satellite coverage so I don't think it's
actually going to be able to find the
location so yeah it's not it's the
general area where we're at but a lot of
people live in that area too so go back
home here and then you can also see here
is the VZ navigator version except oh
this requires a downloading everything
alright we're not going to do that so
we'll go home while that supposedly
downloads and take a look at the Bing
search bar which allows you to either
use swype or we don't want to do that we
can just hit the search option pizza
parlor and presumably it should look for
a pizza place but maybe we didn't stop
it quick enough so we'll see what
happens thinking searching for City
pizza parlor well that's not going to
work alright well you get the gist of it
it works pretty similarly to you know
Google's version of voice search so the
other things we have here are this is
kind of handy the my verizon application
and right now it's just setting it up
and what this does is let you get to
sort of a drill in depth to your um your
usage your you know your monthly bill
since since it since this is a review
unit we're not going to have that option
available but you can see that there's
all sorts of different services on here
friends and family family locator so
seems like for the consumer this could
be quite a handy little application and
we'll go home
and move on to something else so you'll
notice right away that a few of the
applications here are different than the
ones that you'll find on other variants
of the galaxy s as well as the
international unlocked version first one
here is the 3g mobile hotspot and this
is a feature that you have to pay for
through verizon but because this is
review unit i think we get that turn on
you know please turn a little hot spot
so let's say see if we're able to do
this and how long it takes okay so we
should be able to go into the settings
and there we are if we had a Wi-Fi
device we be able to connect to it and
use verizon's 3g network gone over the
tethering so next up why don't we check
out blockbuster application here mmm
which of course is only a link to the
blockbuster application in the android
market so that's not going to help us
too much what else do we have a car
cradle we found that we've seen that
before desk cradle that's handy if
you're going to be using this as an
alarm clock maybe at night or on your
desk at work some other rising specific
applications here are the mobile IM
service which gives you access to a IM
windows live and yahoo but as that
window just said before not over Wi-Fi
so you can only use this service over 3g
which you may not particularly like that
but that's how verizon wants it some
other ones here are we already checked
out my verizon mobile there's a skype
mobile application which is really nice
and sort of a welcome move that
providers are starting to let people use
their networks and also Wi-Fi networks
as we've seen with tmobile and um a to
make calls and you know not necessarily
demand that people are using their
minutes so we're not going to go through
the whole setup here and then lastly we
will take a look at the V CAST
applications that come on this phone
there are three V CAST applications
which come pre-loaded on the phone
including V CAST music recast tones and
V CAST videos ich a stones is obviously
ringtones and we won't take too much
time with that but the music is powered
by Rhapsody so it's sort of an
interesting application let's see what
we have here what's new and we've tried
this a few times before and it's it's
always downloaded songs pretty quickly
connecting so okay we're not going to
charge our review account for this song
but you get the general gist of things
and now we'll go back and you can also
see V CAST videos unfortunately this
also only works over 3g and the
resolution is rather low so we go to
staying in news and we want to watch you
know CBS News these are all pre-recorded
clips Zuckerberg gives in something and
we'll turn this here you can see it's
qvga at 256k with 32 kilobyte audio home
so it looks all right but it's certainly
not nearly as high resolution as the
device is capable of displaying so we
don't know if necessarily this is
something that we would pay for each
month if given the opportunity so other
than that many of the things that you've
seen on our past software tours are the
same here
the reskinned notifications bar all of
the widgets are the same except for one
single widget and that is the data usage
widget which tells you how much data
you've used so far this billing period
and if you click it it takes you to the
verizon mobile app which is sort of nice
so that's something that will probably
be helpful to a lot of people who are
trying to watch their data especially as
unlimited plans go the way of the dodo
and everyone is subjected to tier
pricing in the next few months and years
so this has been Evan Blass for pocket
now I hope you've enjoyed this software
tour of verizon samsung fascinate aka
the galaxy s and please tune in next
time for our next video have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
