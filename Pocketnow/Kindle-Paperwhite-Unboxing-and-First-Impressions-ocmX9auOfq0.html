pocketnow.com you know tablets are
awesome because they do so much but
there's nothing like a dedicated device
that does one thing really really well
like the Kindle e-reader the Kindle
e-reader has been around for several
years now and the paperwhite is the
biggest change yet amazon is finally
going to a new screen technology that's
higher resolution than we saw on the
Kindle one on the Kindle 2 and on the
Kindle 3 and then there is the Kindle
Touch and several other variants after
that we've got new screen technology we
have a built in light and we've got a
new form factor this video we're going
to unbox the Kindle paperwhite let's get
to it
okay and is it me or does the name
paperwhite make you feel relaxed say it
paperwhite paperwhite just got a nice
sound to it doesn't it so let's unbox
here the Kindle and the Kindle
paperwhite is Amazon's answer to the
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble glow light although they
claim that it's better it has better
screen technology and so forth so let's
take out the Kindle and as with all
Kindles you get a really cool unboxing
experience you get the device a simple
charging cable which no longer comes
with of course the wall work which is
kind of unfortunate but everyone's got
them we're using standard microUSB which
is great and this is the Kindle
paperwhite it feels super light it's
super thin it probably has a great in
hand feel these dedicated e-reader
devices are just amazing for reading as
they should be because that's really all
that they do unless you like the
experimental web browser now I'm so
curious to see how the screen clarity
compares to the last Kindle with that
out of the way the Kindle Touch and over
here we've got a software update going
and that's a strange time to do a
software update but hey I just want to
bring this out for a sec remember this
this is the original Kindle no this is
not a prototype that I stole from Amazon
headquarters although it looks just like
a prototype doesn't I mean did they
actually ship this thing and yeah they
did and this was an amazing device
because it was shaped like a wedge it
was perfect to hold
your hand it was definitely thicker it
had a user replaceable battery although
most people never replaced it just a
really cool device the device that
started it off I wish I could turn this
on right now but I can't because it is
broken as you can see it took a fall and
the screen broke so screen technology
has changed a lot since the first Kindle
page refresh rates are way up way or way
down I should say there's so much faster
and now with the paperwhite we've got a
built-in light with the Kindle Touch if
you wanted to have a light you can buy
the case that has this pop-out light but
it's so bright that if you're reading in
bed and someone sleeping next to you
you're kind of bother them no doubt
about it so let's turn on the paperwhite
this thing is so light and we've got
this nice soft touch plastic it's just
going to be an awesome reading device it
kind of reminds me actually of the
Kindle Fire HD 7 which has this thick
bezel giving you a really nice place to
hold the device compared to the HD
though the Kindle paperwhite is super
lightweight so let's go to the bottom
here we've got no speaker this time and
we've got 2 gigabytes of memory let's
see what happens I'm really curious to
see the clarity of this display so here
it comes
and like all Kindle devices it's
registered to your account right out of
the box which is fantastic very minimal
setup and we'll let it boot up and we'll
come back in a sec okay we've got both
devices starting up right now the
backlight is turned on here on the
paperwhite and the uniformity of the
backlight is fantastic much better than
the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble globe light it just
looks really good the white is much
whiter here than on the Kindle Touch
obviously paperwhite something else
that's different about the paperwhite is
that it has capacitive screen technology
compared to the Kindle Touch which had
some sort of infrared screen technology
the problem with the Kindle Touch was
always that it was very difficult to
highlight things on the screen to tap on
words because there's a very imprecise
screen technology that was pretty poor
so it's great to finally have capacitive
touch the same sort of capacitive touch
were used to on our androids and our
iPhones and our tablets that precision
is finally here with the paperwhite
which is great if you like to highlight
or interact with content so let's click
get started' high contrast high
resolution built-in display get started
connect to Wi-Fi so I'll get that going
so I'm typing in my password here and
this keyboard feels like a real keyboard
whereas on the Kindle Touch it just felt
like you touched a letter and then it
would respond like a second later it
feels so unnatural so we should be able
to have this registered directly to our
account the touch sensitivity is
fantastic looks like we're gonna have to
login that's really strange that they're
not pre registering them from the
factory like they've been doing okay
strangely as I was typing my email
address and my Amazon credentials it
said welcome Brandon minimun so I guess
I didn't need to type in the information
I guess it was pre registered from the
factory okay so all your books are
archived for free in the cloud we've got
a new UI here that is kind of
reminiscent actually of the Kindle Fire
HD so we are going to try to get into a
book here so we can compare the clarity
of the text thanks to the higher res
1024 768 screen versus 800 by 600 and I
never thought that the text on the
Kindle Touch was particularly grainy I
always thought it was quite clear so
getting started there we go tap a book
to open it I mmm yep let's get past this
easy reach of course this is from the
Kindle Touch a little tutorial which you
cannot skip that's okay okay wants you
to do things with it tap to close x-ray
okay so let's compare the quality of the
screens again the Kindle paperwhite here
has a higher res screen let's see if you
can tell the difference on camera now
we've got Steve Jobs book here and we're
going to get in close to where it says
the downside so look at that and then
I'll bring up the paperwhite here see if
you can see a difference
you know I I think that it's a little
bit more clear on the paperwhite but
it's not a dramatic difference like I
said the 800 by 600 screen was always
very clear and crisp so it was never a
matter of needing a higher resolution
screen but it's great to have one
because certain on-screen elements look
really good like the keyboard for
example that you saw earlier here on the
paperwhite so let's start on that
backlight I'm going to turn off the
lights in the room okay so the lights
are off in the room not that dim in here
but you can kind of get the point so we
click on the light icon and we slide our
finger up and the page kind of glows
let's go all the way to the top and yeah
it's a really uniform light what I'm
noticing is some disgusting stuff along
the bottom here I don't know what's up
with that you sort of see some gray
stuff hopefully that doesn't impede on
the reading experience that's really
strange actually
well beyond the bottom here everything
is uniformly glowing and it's books
white looks like a white page and the
text looks fantastic the touch response
Wow look at that page refresh time it's
almost instant and if you have the
original Kindle you know that pressing
the page next button or page previous
button resulted in like a second and a
half delay which people really didn't
mind it was new technology but finally
eating is to the point where it kind of
feels like you're reading on a tablet
actually let's see the precision in
tapping on a word so I'm going to click
preferred I've got to do a tap and hold
right not too bad really good touch
sensitivity feels more natural seems
like a really great screen so we're
going to talk more about the Kindle
paperwhite let us know in the comments
if you got a paperwhite or if you still
want to a dedicated e-reader or if
you're past that and you just want to
have your iPad or you want to have your
Nexus 7 or what have you and download
the Kindle app and read that way that's
that's cool too so if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
