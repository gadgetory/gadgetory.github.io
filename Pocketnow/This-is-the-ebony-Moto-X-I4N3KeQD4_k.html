I had no idea that by Friday it would
become something of a collector's item
so Lenovo if you're watching and you're
planning on changing things inside of
Motorola don't change this I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket now this is the ebony
Moto X and I like it a lot so the idea
here is not to re-review the Moto X
we've already done that a few times at
pocket now then by the way if you want
to see those reviews check out the links
in the description and follow us on
social media so you don't miss future
features instead what we want to do is
give you a quick look at the Wooden Moto
X which we first got hands-on time with
back in July but which just became
available for purchase this month this
one is a personal purchase that I made
it's the ebony version with black
faceplate and blue accents I was tempted
to go more conservative with the accent
color do some silver or black because I
was worried about clashing with the wood
but I'm really glad I stuck with this
metallic cobalt blue this wood is so
dark that it's very forgiving very
flexible and you should feel comfortable
going a little crazy with your accent
color if you want to as you can see I
also went for the custom engraving which
is really more like a decal if you look
at it up close but it serves its purpose
and I've also elected to go with the
black front rather than the white which
i think looks quite a bit better of
course I can show you pictures of the
thing all day long and you can see some
nice 3d models over at moto maker 2 but
what does it feel like compared to a
more conventional Moto X Wow at first
touch I don't like it as much
despite the sealant coating Motorola
applied to the wood to keep it
water-resistant the ebony model here
feels much less rubbery it's smoother
drier and more natural well a lot more
like wood and the phone came right out
of the box with some light marks on the
casing it should be easy to get those
off with a damp paper towel it's not a
big deal I know it's hand assembled but
come on Motorola this is a special
purchase and it should be pristine out
of the box
finally the much celebrated dimple while
still here is shallower than on the
plastic version so the wooden motox is
by no means better in every respect but
it's still quite a beautiful creation
and every bit the phone have been pining
for the ebony casing stands out the
chassis feels just as sturdy and palm
friendly as before and the
personalization makes it feel special
without lumbering over the line into
sentimentalism and finally the fact that
this is possibly the last flagship to
come off Motorola's assembly line before
it becomes a part of Lenovo well that
makes it even more special I know I know
what can I say I'm a total SAP we've got
a lot more on every different flavor of
the Moto X folks that includes reviews
comparisons features you name it we've
got it
at pocketnow.com and here in our channel
page but before you go anywhere drop us
