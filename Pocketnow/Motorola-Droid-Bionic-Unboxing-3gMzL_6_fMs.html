and we finally got our hands on a droid
bionic by motorola for the verizon
network here in the USA so let's go
ahead and open this thing up and see
what comes with all right let's start
out by doing a quick walk around the box
on the front we've got the really cool
stylized motorola droid cybernetic eye i
think that's what they call it or on the
bottom simple branding Verizon 4G LTE
certified on the back completely nothing
just this nice slate gray concrete gray
looking maybe that's brushed aluminum on
the side verizon google motorola logos
again a verizon 4g LTE certified and
over on the side just verizon google
motorola so very basic very simple very
clean let's go ahead and crack the top
off inside droid bionic stamped in there
very cool of course the phone but we'll
get to that in just a minute take that
out very nice lift out package inside
we've got a zippered bag with the back
cover inside of it so that's going to
make putting the the battery and sim
card very easy we've got a USB cable
with a nice mmm hello moto e komo tow
cable right there with a label on it
same thing that we're used to seeing in
everybody else's they're just a nice
micro USB can't even get that to their
you micro USB for charging and for
connecting two computers why not moving
along we've got a battery i have taken
this one out of the plastic that it
already came in so you can see what it
looks like there it is a huge battery
3.8 volt which is similar to all of the
others we see if i can get the milliamp
hours here for you 1735 milliamp hours
that's a really really large capacity
battery so we should get quite a bit of
use out of that unless the 4g LTE
sucks it down really fast but that's
going to be covered in an upcoming video
so let's not get ahead of ourselves we
also have one of these lovely wall warts
or AC to DC adapter as some of you like
to call it it's a nice relatively small
and Motorola branded and there's the USB
port right there and then we've got some
manuals the getting started guide the
product safety and warranty information
consumer information about radio
fragrance emissions and responsible
driving and important consumer
information and that's it in the box now
since this is an LTE device you're also
going to get one of these with it which
is a verizon 4g LTE sim the sim looks
just like any other sim it's not a micro
sim just a regular one Verizon 4G
branded and the little sim connectors
right there and of course that's what's
in the box of course you guys want to
see the phone the phone itself comes
with some protective stuff so I'll go
ahead and take that off so you can see
the screen battery is not installed sim
is not installed and the back plate is
not installed so that's what we get in
the unboxing let's go to the next video
which is going to be the hardware walk
around of the motorola droid bionic for
verizon
