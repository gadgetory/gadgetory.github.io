relationship management kind of playing
with life Tori with life we'll see what
happens you know what it gives back the
thing that we added to this specifically
for Windows Mobile is
the achievements and leaderboards there
so just starting a new game
to start out with
create-a-sim feature has a ton
in here
he'd start off the guy or girl
you can change hairdos
make up
similar is this experience Simon yeah
basically the same exact it's pretty
similar to except for the achievements
and the and the mayor boards but for the
most part it's it's fairly similar come
this one
you can change different outfits I'm
just going from random crazy looks here
are two gave her a crown
there's a number of different
possibilities
all the way I mean you can do everything
all the way to I color which I color
wouldn't matter cuz you start sunglasses
then there's the dice down at the bottom
which just does a random generation
different outfits different combinations
so then once you hit start you can go
and choose your persona whether you seem
to be a mature projectable trades and
nice guys these maniacs
this one he's just crazy and he choose a
couple other traits
it's got no sense of humor and easily
bored
Yeti's friendly
a bit of slop let me go in and name your
sin
quickly
so we just unlocked an achievement
already it's the right step achievement
so it's kind of one of the early
achievements we give just for
for doing your customization
then it immediately drops you in your
house there's normally a tutorial that
it would walk through that I mean I'm
gonna skip that
you've got your basic needs at the
bottom food sleep
and shower you want to make sure that
your sim is you know well fed well
rested as she needs to
thing I have a new new
just having snack
anywhere you tap to that's kind of where
he goes it's the main thing is it's this
open world environment so I'm going to
go to the town and just see if I can
interact with ya
