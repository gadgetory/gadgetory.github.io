design on video samsung kies is exactly
what we're getting with the gear s2
we've got good and bad news for galaxy
note5 customers i'm high memory that i'm
waiting to spend my friday bar
celebrating FC barcelona this is parking
out daily if you want official news
today let's begin with Samsung the
company did not reveal everything that
we wanted to know at yesterday's
unpacked event for example the good news
that if you wanted 128 gig variants of
the galaxy note 5 or galaxy s6 edge+ you
will get that option in the United
States for pretty much every US carrier
and scenes which is great news but on
the negative side we heard rumors that
Samsung was not going to make a massive
launch of the note 5 for reasons not
specified and as it turns out the
company pretty much confirmed that the
UK customers will not be able to get
this phone until 2016 probably for
reasons again we don't understand other
official news that were not made
official for reasons we don't understand
is this really nifty flight tracker
that's available on iOS 9 + OS 10 and
copy thumb and you're going to say yeah
well this is available for Google now
already and for Cortana true the
difference is that this service actually
tells you where the plane is not just
when the flight is estimating there's a
real time flight tracker built in which
is something we've seen on previous
third-party applications but great to
see it integrated on the service we
should learn more as the beta has become
official and then shifting over to the
bad news we get a very sad announcement
from Lenovo which is the parent company
of Motorola obviously Motorola hasn't
done really what when it comes to sales
over the last couple of quarters so as
it turns out the company has just
announced that it will be laying off
1,500 employees from the US division of
Motorola because obviously that is the
company that's most affected we have a
new Moto X we have a new Moto G and we
actually like these products so we do
hope that these are the products that
give Motorola the popularity that it had
years ago particularly because obviously
it is very sad to see these companies
wither away now one very highly
anticipated product or products for
later this year is Google's future Nexus
if we hear that there's a huawei phablet
an analogy Nexus smartphone and today we
finally land some render leaks on video
that shows exactly what to expect for
this LG Nexus and to start it off it is
completely different to everything else
we've seen from LG front firing speakers
a very odd camera hump the fingerprint
scanner is odd as well the dimple just
looks weird but then again hey these are
renders they could be true they could
not be true i'd love to hear in the
comments down below do you think about
this design I'll take it and finally for
the news that will highly depend on your
taste Samsung has just posted teasers of
its gear s2 in different photographs
with models different camera angles
we've got a bevy of watch straps in
different colors all looking rubber no
real high quality here it could just be
that this is the sport variant and we
just don't know what to expect for the
other two variants and we're just in
from major surprise at Aoife it's hard
to see if this is a rotating bezel or
not but it does lead me to the question
of the day that was actually the whole
purpose of this segment what do you
think about this watch this gear as to
do you like the design that you see or
not because in my case no it looks a lot
like a very cheap polar watch that you
use for fitness and not something
fashionable but again it could just be
the sport variant leave us a comment
down below what do you think about this
design friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
earlier before this video is filmed make
sure you follow us on pocono comment
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
and follow me on twitter i underscore
iveta or on instagram it I'm ever leave
it up please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am high
metal better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
