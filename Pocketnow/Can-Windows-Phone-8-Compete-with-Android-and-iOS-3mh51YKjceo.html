pocket now calm you know it's been about
two years since the first Windows Phone
devices came out back in the fall of
2010 and now windows phone 8 devices are
hitting store shelves I spent about a
week with the windows phone 8x and I
want to tell you what I think about
Windows Phone 8 now two years after the
release of the platform let's get to it
first and foremost windows phone 8
finally supports high-resolution
displays and it's great to see windows
phone in high resolution the 8x has a
1280 by 720 display and indeed windows
phone 8 looks good at this resolution
but i have to admit I've grown quite
used to hide DPI displays thanks to
android and iOS so this wasn't
particularly thrilling for windows phone
8 I was most excited to mess around with
live tile sizes one of my biggest
frustrations with previous versions of
Windows Phone was that the user wasn't
given any choice on how large or small
various tiles were for example I hated
having my photo style always be to buy
one well that is no more now that you
can change the size of any live tile the
prospect of a get in get out and get
back to life kind of operating system is
even more possible because you can do a
lot with glanceable info if you're
changing the live tile sizes based on
your own needs after just a few minutes
of customizing I had the Start screen
customized to my liking I placed some
context in the small live tile size in
the upper left corner to allow me to
quickly dial people I contact often i
added a medium size tile for my calendar
so that i could quickly see my next
appointment i placed for internet
shortcuts again in the small tile size
to conserve space in the middle of the
display then using the large live tile
size i placed my email inbox a little
bit further down granting me a view of
my newest message i went on to configure
my Start screen to fit my needs things
were going well next I wanted to see if
the speed and fluidity had improved for
windows phone 8 since it's now on the
Windows NT kernel and now that it's
running on two cpu cores windows phone 8
finally supports multiple cores bouncing
around between ABS flipping through
screens and browse
the web windows phone 8 felt fast but
not noticeably faster than previous
versions perhaps this is a testament to
how well tuned windows phone is and how
well it has been tuned for speed and
fluidity the next thing I wanted to
check was the app situation had it
improved so I jumped into the App Store
to search for some favorites Facebook
and Twitter were there both with live
tiles I noticed that now on the Windows
Phone app store now just called Store
app listings tell you if there is a live
tile associated with the app neat so I
proceeded to download the weather
channel Facebook and Twitter all of
which have live tiles and variable tile
sizes interestingly some apps can take
on all three live tile sizes and some
just two then i installed the YouTube
app and I was tremendously disappointed
to see that the app was merely a link to
em youtube com fail while windows phone
8 has a built-in music app that works
very well with windows 8 and offers some
great features I use Spotify often oddly
a search for Spotify yielded no results
but probably because a windows phone 8
app version of Spotify is in the app is
in the works and his forthcoming I also
didn't find google voice but plenty of
knockoffs and that story rang true for
many apps searches i tried bad piggies
not there hulu not there speedtest.net
not there chrome not there it looked
like Windows Phone had not yet achieved
parity in terms of app selection with
what is offered by Android and iOS and
then I began using the device and this
is where some of the neat little
features of Windows Phone 8 came to the
surface I set my lock screen to show me
photos from facebook on a rotating basis
which was pretty neat I installed a
camera lens app called cam well which
applied some amazing real-time effects
to the camera I was reminded by just how
productive and efficient the windows
phone email app is and I felt confident
that Windows Phone would never crash or
lag and then it would quickly respond to
all of my inputs and it did I also came
across a few niggling issues for example
many of the third party live tiles
stopped updating my facebook tile was
showing an update I made over a week ago
and the weather channel live tile app
was showing conditions from when it
forecasted to snow it seems that you
actually have to go into the
app to have it update and that's really
not ideal so in the end I came away from
my week using Windows Phone 8 feeling
exactly the way I did about it two years
ago I think that the platform is unique
refreshing and it feels so fast it's
still that middle ground for those that
want to customize more than iOS but not
have as many options as an Android with
some awesome hardware coming out that
run Windows Phone 8 like the Lumia 920
and the Samsung at TS there are plenty
of reasons to get excited about Windows
Phone 8 but me I'm sticking with Android
and iOS four now because I just can't
get past the lack of X it's possible
that some developers are retooling their
apps to work on Windows Phone 8 but I'm
just tired of waiting so let us know
what you think about Windows Phone 8 two
years after the platform came out
Microsoft killed windows mobile they
brought windows phone 7 to the table and
it's been a while what do you think
about the platform drop us a comment and
