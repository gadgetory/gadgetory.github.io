pocketnow.com you know it's been about
two years since the first Windows Phone
devices came out back in the fall of
2010 and now Windows Phone 8 devices are
hitting store shelves I spent about a
week with the Windows Phone 8x and I
want to tell you what I think about
Windows Phone 8 now two years after the
release of the platform let's get to it
first and foremost Windows Phone 8
finally supports high resolution
displays and it's great to see Windows
Phone in high resolution the 8x has a
1280 by 720 display and indeed Windows
Phone 8 looks good at this resolution
but I have to admit I've grown quite
used to high DPI displays thanks to
Android and iOS so this wasn't
particularly thrilling for Windows Phone
8 I was most excited to mess around with
live tile sizes one of my biggest
frustrations with previous versions of
Windows Phone was that the user wasn't
given any choice on how large or small
various tiles were for example I hated
having my photo style always be two by
one well that is no more now that you
can change the size of any live tile the
prospect of a get in get out and get
back to life kind of operating system is
even more possible because you can do a
lot with glanceable info if you're
changing the live tile sizes based on
your own needs after just a few minutes
of customizing I had the Start screen
customized to my liking I placed some
context in the small live tile size in
the upper left corner to allow me to
quickly dial people eye contact often I
added a medium sized tile for my
calendar so that I could quickly see my
next appointment
I placed four internet shortcuts again
in the small tile size to conserve space
in the middle of the display then using
the large live tile size I placed my
email INBOX a little bit further down
granting me a view of my newest message
I went on to configure my Start screen
to fit my needs things were going well
next I wanted to see if the speed and
fluidity had improved for Windows Phone
8 since it's now on the Windows NT
kernel and now that it's running on to
CPU cores Windows Phone 8
finally supports multiple cores bouncing
around between apps flipping through
screens and browsing
web Windows Phone II felt fast but not
noticeably faster than previous versions
perhaps this is a testament to how well
tuned Windows Phone is and how well it
has been tuned for speed and fluidity
the next thing I wanted to check was the
app situation had it improved so I
jumped into the app store to search for
some favorites Facebook and Twitter were
they're both with live tiles I noticed
that now in the Windows Phone app store
now just called store app listings tell
you if there is a live tile associated
with the app neat so I proceeded to
download The Weather Channel
Facebook and Twitter all of which have
live tiles and variable tile sizes
interestingly some apps can take on all
three live tile sizes and some just two
then I installed the YouTube app and I
was tremendously disappointed to see
that the app was merely a link to em you
tube comm fail while Windows Phone 8 has
a built-in music app that works very
well with Windows 8 and offers some
great features I use Spotify often oddly
a search for Spotify yielded no results
but probably because a Windows Phone 8
app version of Spotify is in the app is
in the works and is forthcoming
I also didn't find Google Voice but
plenty of knockoffs and that story rang
true for many app searches I tried bad
piggies not their Hulu not their
speedtest.net not their Chrome not their
it looked like Windows Phone had not yet
achieved parity in terms of app
selection with what is offered by
Android and iOS and then I began using
the device and this is where some of the
neat little features of Windows Phone 8
came to the surface I set my lock screen
to show me photos from facebook on a
rotating basis which was pretty neat I
installed a camera lens app called cam
well which applied some amazing
real-time effects to the camera I was
reminded by just how productive and
efficient the Windows Phone email app is
and I felt confident that Windows Phone
would never crash or lag and then it
would quickly respond to all of my
inputs and it did I also came across a
few niggling issues for example many of
the third-party live tiles stopped
updating my facebook tile was showing an
update I made over a week ago and The
Weather Channel live tile app was
showing conditions from when it
forecasted to snow it seems that you
actually have to go into the
to have it update and that's really not
ideal so in the end I came away from my
week using Windows Phone 8 feeling
exactly the way I did about it two years
ago I think that the platform is unique
refreshing and it feels so fast it's
still that middle ground for those that
want to customize more than iOS but not
have as many options as an Android with
some awesome hardware coming out that
run Windows Phone 8 like the Lumia 920
and the Samsung at TS there are plenty
of reasons to get excited about Windows
Phone 8 but me I'm sticking with Android
and iOS for now because I just can't get
past the lack of apps it's possible that
some developers are retooling their apps
to work on Windows Phone 8 but I'm just
tired of waiting so let us know what you
think about Windows Phone 8 two years
after the platform came out
Microsoft killed Windows Mobile they
brought Windows Phone 7 to the table and
it's been a while what do you think
about the platform drop us a comment and
