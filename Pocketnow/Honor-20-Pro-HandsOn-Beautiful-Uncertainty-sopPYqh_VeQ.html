honor 20 series because yes the company
is now experimenting with its first
series the honor 20 light has already
launched in certain countries and this
is one of two bigger brothers I'm
heading that up with pocket now and
let's go hands on the honor number
series has always been about aesthetics
and the camera and we've praised its
predecessor the honor 8-under 9 on our
10 were always some of our favorites
this one is no exception now as opposed
to your standard flagship this phone is
actually smaller honor is prioritizing
one-handed use so that translates to a
six point two six inch IPS LCD and
ninety one point six cream to body ratio
I know when that six inch has become
easy to handle but the bezels are so
small that it's quite possible the
selfie camera grew to 32 megapixels but
luckily the punch hole didn't honor
claims a foreign one light fusion aka
pixel binning to enhance low-light
performance which we will be testing the
design follows the usual unique approach
that we've been accustomed to by honor
now with a theme of light and color
options that they dubbed dynamic
holographic design the holo effect is
achieved by three layers of depth being
that the glass color and the DEF layer
there are two color options phantom
black and this phantom blue and they
support what honour'd calls four-sided
glass to add curves all around for
ergonomics even the fingerprint scanner
has been mounted on the side with the
one-handed use approach in mind which
makes sense so long as you're
right-handed
as for internals we have the cure 980
processor eight gigs of RAM up to 256
gigs of storage a four thousand milliamp
hour battery with supercharged in the
box and dual nano SIM capabilities if
you're wondering what's missing there is
no IP rating it is a single firing
speaker and there is a dongle in the box
because there is no headphone jack now
the camera is a big deal though the
primary 48 megapixel Sony IMX 586 is the
first smart phone camera that I know of
with an F 1.4 aperture there's four in
one light fusion aka pixel venting
giving you a brighter 12 megapixel shot
and there's OAS and laser autofocus
we have a super wide angle 16 megapixel
camera 117 degrees a field of view and
night mode does support it and then
there's also an 8 megapixel telephoto
with 3x optical zoom 5x hybrid zoom and
30x digital and last but not least the
small little camera is actually not
time-of-flight nope this is actually a 2
megapixel macro camera that helps you
get as close as four centimeters from
your subject the benefits from the
camera are being able to have portrait
shots without a crop night mode as I
mentioned but I don't see the ultra
clarity mode that we saw in the honor of
u20s 4 software we have Magic OS 2.1 on
top of android 9 pi give an honors
relationship with Huawei's R&amp;amp;D they
claim that this allows them to do a lot
of tuning in-house like offering GPU
turbo 3.0 for games and letting you play
fortnight at 60 frames per second out of
the box the user interface is sadly not
my favorite but it is quite snappy and
in 3 days that I've been using this
phone battery life has proven to be
really good now an irony is that even if
there is no headphone jack and there are
no dual firing speakers there is a
virtual 9.1 surround sound which helps
detect where the source of the audio is
coming from and adapts in order to
enhance the experience of you're playing
first-person shooters you'll know where
you'll be shot from and stuff like that
that's quite useful at the time of our
briefing we weren't given price points
but a ballpark figure that was given to
me was that the phone will be priced
below 650 euros and then the base model
will be sub 500 oh and if you want to
know the differences with the honoured
20 the primary camera is a 48 megapixels
with F 1.8 aperture
no OIS 16 megapixel ultra wide and the
same 2 megapixel macro a depth sensor
instead of a telephoto and no laser
autofocus storages of 6 signa bytes of
RAM and 128 gigs of storage yet visually
they aren't really that much different
so yes this is the honor 20 pro part of
the honored 20 series my first
impression so far this is a very good
looking phone good one-handed use I do
enjoy the fact that it
focused on gamers that it brings a solid
camera but obviously we need more time
to test it and provide you with our full
review and yes we know that there are
other phones in this price range that
are also powerful so it'll be
interesting to put them head-to-head for
future comparisons let us know which
ones would you like to see in the
comments down below and while you're at
it make sure you follow us on social
media as our extended coverage all
happens on Instagram and yes you can
also follow me in case you're bored and
want to see some weirdo post of odd
shots of me running or handling phones
and please give this video a thumbs up
if you like what you saw
I'm home it again.i thanks so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
