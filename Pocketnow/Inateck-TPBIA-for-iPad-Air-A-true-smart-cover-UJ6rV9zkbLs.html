mainly because of the added bulk but I
will admit that I am a big fan of
sleeves they provide protection when you
really need it whether it's having your
phone in your pocket or your tablet in
your backpack so yeah you could bet that
I'm always available for any sleeve
that's up for review
I'm hi I'm Eddie Vedder with pocket now
and let's have a quick look at the
initech TPB I a
initech is already a brand that's gained
a very positive reputation with us make
sure you watch Michael Fisher's recent
impressions on the BTS P 10 plus now if
you didn't know it one of the things
that initech is most famous for is
really--it's cases and their ipad
offerings are rather awesome the tpb ia
offers complete device protection and a
very elegant package for both the iPad
air and iPad air 2 it's made out of this
really cool thick felt construction and
it also includes a magnetic flap at one
of the sides to make sure the iPad
doesn't fall off it's made out of a very
nice tan leather and yes I did confirm
that it is leather even though the
sleeve is rather thick for daily use
it's exasan size is just about right to
not add significant bulk to your
experience carrying an iPad which is
really important the inside of the case
is ample enough to allow you to slide
the iPad easily and with a little effort
you can even fit last year's iPad air
with its Smart Cover attached but what
makes this case really cool is that you
really don't need to do that
see this sleeve is actually a two in one
you can see it in the description you
can simply slide the magnetic flap to
one side and prop the case sideways and
voila you have an iPad stand that
provides the same functionality that you
currently have with a Smart Cover so
yeah you're pretty much saving yourself
a lot of money given the fact that this
case is half the price of the Smart
Cover and it provides the full
protection that the Smart Cover doesn't
provide overall after a very pleasant
experience testing the TPB ia over the
last couple of weeks and matching the
experience with the 13 to 17 dollar
price tag on amazon.com it's really hard
for us
not to recommend this as a must-have
product for your iPad if you just lost
your Smart Cover or you just don't want
to buy one save yourself some money and
give yourself the opportunity to test
the initech TP BIA once again this has
been hi Natalie that I would pocket now
