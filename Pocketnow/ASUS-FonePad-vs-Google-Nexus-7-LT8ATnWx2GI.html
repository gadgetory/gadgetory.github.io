at mwc 2013 still at the issues both and
we couldn't help but stick around for
one more video featuring the newest
fonepad this time comparing it with the
also is who spilled Nexus 7 let's take a
look so just taking a look at the
hardware here real quick you can
definitely tell these devices were built
by the same manufacturer the same design
language is in effect here including the
very comparable thickness and these kind
of scalloped sides as we get toward the
edges of the devices big difference of
course is in the finish with the rubbery
soft touch on the back of the Nexus 7
feeling a bit more durable than the
metal here on the phone pad this is a
titanium gold by the way else Zack I
always do that this is champagne gold by
the way o is also available in titanium
grey but also before we leave the back
of the device we can see that in
addition the asuste branding Intel
Inside is called out here and this is a
processor difference we should call out
the nexus 7 powered by a Tegra 3 whereas
the S whose phone pad is powered by an
Intel Atom z2420 clocked at 1.2 gig go
ahead and flip these around you'll
notice the volume and the power standby
keys are not on the same side on these
devices we also have a removable panel
up here on the phone pad where the
micro-sim and microSD card slot live not
in evidence obviously on the Nexus 7
which does not feature expandable memory
coming around to the front go ahead and
unlock the device these devices are both
running Android jelly bean but one of
them namely the Nexus 7 is running the
latest version at 4.2 because it is a
Nexus device the phone have had the
phone pad running the earlier for dot
one dot 2 probably but not definitely
because of the asuste customization
layer here also you obviously you can
notice that and the notification shade
and in other areas like the keyboard if
you go ahead and hop into the messaging
application you can go
tap away and you can see that keyboard
is very very different experience than
something like the stock keyboard right
there and of course the most prominent
difference the earpiece to the left of
the 1.2 megapixel camera for the front
facing side which these units share the
is whose phone pad has the ear piece of
top so you can use it to take calls at
your head if you're into that kind of
thing otherwise as I say these panels
are identical 1280 x 800 many other
specs are the same and let's not forget
these do come from the same manufacturer
so that shouldn't surprise us but so
it's all going to come down to whether
you want a stock google experience or
you want the customization layer with
the earpiece of course an expandable
memory among a few other details just a
quick look Michael Fisher hear of a
pocket now that's Tony behind the camera
looking at the asuste products here at
mwc 2013 this isn't the end of them stay
tuned for a lot more
