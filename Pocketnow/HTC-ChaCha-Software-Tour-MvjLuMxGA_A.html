pocketnow.com
and today we're gonna take a look at the
software on the HTC ChaCha for which we
thank our friends over at globe that
code that UK for sending us a reindeer
unit and you may know that the HTC
ChaCha is coming to AT&amp;amp;T soon as the HTC
status which is a normal name given that
the Facebook button allows you to easily
change your status on Facebook or post a
short message image video music whatever
to your Facebook wall what's
particularly interesting is that HTC
made a tremendous job in fitting HTC
Sense 2.1 to this landscape screen which
is a permanent landscape screen it's got
an HD GA 480 by 320 resolution and the
they nailed it without any further ado
let's get to the software tour of the
HTC ChaCha aka the upcoming the AT&amp;amp;T
status
so here we are with the HTC ChaCha which
is running Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread out
of the box it will hopefully receive
2.3.4 update soon and it's got HTC Sense
2.1 for messenger now it's not HTC Sense
3.0 which you might find on later
devices like the sensation Sensation 4G
or evil 3d but it's got a great look to
it it weight feel HTC adopted the new
lock screen which is working very well
and they managed to somehow optimize it
for a permanent landscape display let's
jump right back to the home screen and
let's see the lockscreen now when you
turn on your screen this is what you get
a permanent landscape display with the
lock ring at the bottom now unlocking
the screen is done like this you take
the ring from the bottom and drop it
anywhere on the screen and your device
will be unlocked but you have these
shortcut icons which you can customize
let's say you want to jump straight into
the mail application you just read the
mail icon and drop it into the ring and
get you back let's get back let's lock
it again let's say you want to quickly
take a picture you just grab the camera
icon drop it into the ring and it takes
you straight to the camera application
now the camera is covered but you can
see that it launched automatically this
is what you get once you unlock your
smartphone this is the HTC Sense 2.1
homescreen on the HTC ChaCha
it's got 3 + 3 6 shortcut icons on the
left and on the right it's got a clock
widget with a Facebook aka social
networking widget which will
automatically update at a certain
interval so that you can get a glance of
what your friends are up to just by
looking at the screen of course these as
with any other HTC Sense powered
smartphone can be
customized we'll take a look at that
later swiping to the left will bring you
to another home screen for a total of
let's see we got right now set up seven
aka six plus one which is the last one
you can customize to get back to the
home screen now you've got this - these
two icons on the left and on the right
on the bottom of the screen this will
bring up your application menu and as
you can see it's a little bit different
from what you've got even what you've
gotten used to in your portrait device
you've got the list of applications and
your icons here and on the right side
which would be normally on the bottom
part of your screen you got your
shortcut icons for all application
frequently accessed application and
downloaded applications and this is
throughout the system wherever you have
a screen which implies shortcut icons
you will have them displayed on the
right and to give you an example of that
we'll just jump into the mail
application and you will see your emails
listed as a list in landscape mode on
the left and your shortcuts on the right
floor in box threads favorites
unread marked invites attached so on and
so forth the other button is for
customization and those who are running
HTC Sense 2.1 or above maybe even though
the three are accustomed to this you can
personalize the display by choosing a
scene skin the wallpaper or you can
change the shortcuts on the lock screen
you can add items to your home screen
widgets apps shortcuts folder and you
can personalize the sunset which implies
changing the sound for the ringtone
a notification for the alarms and so on
let's take a look at how you can set up
your home screen we have a blank home
screen number seven and zapping this big
plus icon allows you to add the widget
an app a shortcut or a folder to your
home screen let's take a look at the
widgets basically there are a lot of HTC
widgets approximately those with which
you are accustomed to from your other
HTC devices running Android with HTC
Sense you've got calendars you got clock
you've got a face book dedicated widget
which looks like this
currently refreshing and it will bring
your friends status messages to this
widget let's read this and remove it and
take a look at the others we've got the
facebook chat widget which is
interesting we'll take a look at this in
a minute
these Foursquare widgets are coming with
the Foursquare once you downloaded you
got friends trained Google search HTC
likes which is great for sharing
applications you like with your friends
email Android Market messages the
classic music widgets news and weather
photo widgets which are the same as with
other HTC devices selling tips traffic
which comes with the Google weather and
YouTube now what's particularly
interesting is that there is a dedicated
facebook chat application on the
smartphone and that's unless instructed
to go offline always online and it's a
good idea to turn it off when you want
to sleep at night because some of your
friends might be afraid that something
happened to you because you're not
answering your HTC ChaCha or future AT&amp;amp;T
status will be connected all the time to
your Facebook jet let's take a look at
the Facebook chat widget it currently
allows us to choose from only one out of
one but hopefully there will be a
shorter widget
let's select this one and we will see
who is online our colleague Adam is
online let's jump into the chat
application and this is how it looks we
can type a message and we can send it to
Adam let's take this down from here and
what I want to show you is that some
widgets have the ability of being
configured let's say the People widget
if you drag the People widget and you
drop them to the remove button they will
be removed from your home screen but if
you drop them to the edit button you can
edit them and you can select a group for
widget or rearrange group members which
is great if you want to take somebody
like Brandon and drop him at the top of
the list save and there we go
Brandon is number one favorite let's
take a look at some other scenes with
that on the HTC ChaCha we go to scenes
now we are using the current scene which
is unsaved but you can also select a
social scene you can select a work scene
with the dual clock if you are traveling
a lot for two time zones and it's the
same also with the travel and you have
also a place in basically what changes
is the wallpaper and the home screen
number one bringing you the widgets most
appropriate for that scene ok let's jump
right back and let's take a look at
what's really specific about the HTC
ChaCha
and the future AT&amp;amp;T status the Facebook
button the Facebook button is this
little fella here at the bottom and I'll
try to zoom out just a little bit to
show you what happens if you are
pressing the Facebook button and several
different
mario's let's say you are right now at
the home screen and you are pressing the
Facebook button it will automatically
bring you up this window which will
allow you to post a message and you can
post this message either to a your wall
or tapping on this little button here
somebody else's wall this is great if
you want to post a short update on where
you are what you are doing or you want
to say something to a friend let's just
post a short message to our wall
let's say testing from cha-cha whoops
typo there
cha-cha great once we had hit the post
button our status will be changed and
you will see that once you jump into the
facebook applications Facebook
application and all your friends will
see your new status newsfeed it's
currently refreshing and there we go
testing from cha cha and as you can see
the social widget on the home screen has
already updated to reflect the changes
another thing you can do with the
Facebook button is when you want to
share a song from your music library
let's say you got a song which you like
in particular like this one and you
press the Facebook button it will
automatically bring you the album art
the title of the song and a link to
Amazon and you can tap here a message
like hey check out this great song I
discovered and you can post that message
another thing you can do with the
Facebook button is share pictures if you
have a picture on your smart phone which
you have taken with your camera or you
have synced with your computer you press
the Facebook button and it will
automatically upload to Facebook it says
one photo selected you can select which
album you wants you upload your picture
in if you have any people you want to
tag in your picture you can do that here
you can add tag and description and once
you've done that you just hit the done
button and the picture goes
automatically up to your Facebook album
now another thing you can do with the
with the Facebook button is sharing a
webpage if we go to pocketnow.com and we
are visiting a certain page let's just
take a second until it loads
and jump into the latest article on the
front page and go to the desktop version
you will see the Facebook button below
and I'm not sure you can see that right
here once the page fully loads let's
zoom out you will have the chance to
post it using your Facebook button
whenever your HTC ChaCha
recognizes content which can be shared
your Facebook button will glow and
hopefully we will be able to show you
that and there you go it's pulsing it
shows you that this page can be shared
on your Facebook now let's go to another
address here let's try to go to let's
say Google and see how it works again
you can see that it's glowing
whenever a web page which can be shared
or another content which can be shared
on your Facebook is present it's glowing
and once pressing that Facebook button
there you go
let's go through the settings and see
what's new in the settings we have the
personalization menu which we have shown
you before we have the wireless and
networks airplane mode Wi-Fi Bluetooth
personal hotspot the hotspot settings
VPN mobile network so on and so forth
USB tethering cool settings which are
basically your settings you'd find on
any other Android powered HTC smartphone
same here nothing out of the ordinary
display with the notification flash
because this Mart phone features a small
LED right up there in the speaker grille
you can select which actions trigger the
flash of the LED you got sensor
calibration search privacy so on and so
forth what's interesting here is that
there is a power saver and when your
battery is at 15 20 25 30 % according to
your choice of the total charge it will
automatically do one of these disable
background data Wi-Fi Bluetooth save
screen brightness down to a custom
amount reduce the screen I'm at a
timeout time to a custom time disable
animations and disable vibration jump
right back here we have fastboot
you can enable or disable fastboot now
what is fastboot HTC has demoed fastboot
on several new smartphones including the
HTC ChaCha it's basically the
of the smartphone to startup boots in a
very very good time now let's take a
look at the fast mood but what we will
do right now is turn off the HTC ChaCha
and see how fast it boots back up let's
just hold for the menu power off it will
power off with a power off animation and
once it's off when you hit the power
button
just it will start up in a matter of
seconds now it's completely turned off
let's turn it on and there you go
because I think a couple of to three
maybe four seconds and you're back to a
usable normal State HTC Sense is let it
lagging a little bit but it will load
from the memory and it will take you
right back where you left it it will
update your widgets and there you have
it this was HTC space boots now if he
wants you kill the applications in the
memory while rebooting you need to
restart which will actually close all
applications and we start upon the
shutdown the power of or shut phone down
option does not kill your applications
but what we think it does is that it
saves the state to either phone memory
keeping them hibernated or to the SD
card and when you power it back on it
just restores let's take a look at the
applications which are pre-installed
this let's take a look first at the
applications which I've downloaded the
barcode scanner Facebook Foursquare
Google related applications were
downloaded by me all the other apps came
preloaded with the HTC ChaCha and this
one is Google Books which doesn't need
any introduction at all it's your books
application you've got calculator
calendar call history camcorder camera
and so on and so forth
nothing really out of the ordinary
nothing we
you might not find on other devices we
got an interesting mirror application
which will basically fire up the camera
application
switch to the front-facing VGA camera
and it will allow you to see if your
hair is okay continuing we got HTC hub
HTC likes HTC ChaCha is featured on
htcsense.com and if you have an account
created or if you create an account you
can set up your HTC ChaCha or future HTC
status to be used with the HTC Sense
comm account we've got the market
application we've got the peep which is
HTC's Twitter application an application
for contacts people we've got Google
Talk voice search Wi-Fi hotspot and a
transfer application which allows you to
transfer your quote stuff from a phone
to the other let's take a look at the
internet browsing experience on the
landscape screen because the landscape
is the shape of the Internet you've got
basically a close to desktop like
display on your smart phone and if we go
to Google English and let's try to load
up the desktop version
classic
and let's pinch to zoom out this is what
it looks like on the HTC ChaCha
now some applications can be taking
advantage of the accelerometer and flip
the screen to portrait mode which would
be kind of awkward using a QWERTY
keyboard and let's I think the market
application has support for portrait
display so this is the market as it
looks on the HTC ChaCha
stock right here it's basically your
landscape marketplace and if you flip it
to portrait it will display like this
but it's kind of awkward it's small the
screen is 2.6 inches and it really
doesn't help you plus you cannot type
you'd have to switch it back and then it
will come back to landscape now let's
get back to Internet and see how fast it
loads
we are over Wi-Fi right now and speed
should be really good
we got the mobile version pinching
completely out will allow you to flip
through pages like in tabbed browsing
you can add a new page with a new URL
let's do that right now and go to the
desktop application
you can notice straight from the start
that it's not in a zoomed out position
it's rather zoomed in which makes it
impossible to read as it is right now
but if you pinch to zoom out you can
have a glance at the whole page but the
text is very very small so you will not
have a decent chance of reading this
text let's see if we can zoom in focus
in it can't the camera can't even focus
on this one if you have great eyes great
sights you will have a chance of reading
it but if not you will have to double
tap and read in a zoomed in position now
speed of the internet browser is what
she would expect from an Android browser
browser the processor is 800 megahertz
and we didn't find it to be lacking in
speed or in other terms it does its job
and it does it pretty well you don't
have any lag at all when flipping
through the home screens you don't have
glad when you are flipping through your
applications so the HTC ChaCha really
delivers a solid performance and if you
are a facebook addict or a social
networking addict at that little bit
Facebook or Twitter this is the
smartphone for you because it's got a
great party keyboard the software is
fantastic HTC managed to tweak sense for
an optimum display on the permanent
landscape screen a tnc will have it as
the HTC status we like it we recommend
it the price is good stay tuned for our
full review coming up of the HTC ChaCha
