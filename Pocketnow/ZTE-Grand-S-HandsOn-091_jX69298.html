pocketnow.com we're at CES 2013 taking a
look at zee tv's high-end 1080p smart
phone the grand king s let's take a look
jose de is China's biggest manufacturer
of smartphones and they're coming to the
US with this device at the end of 2013
it's really interesting device extremely
thin bone that is 1080p it's better than
the droid DNA and all the other 1080p
spawns that we've seen so far we've got
a 16 megapixel camera on the back a soft
touch plastic and then that's all kind
of like a firmer softness maybe it's
just plastic enough front here with a
5-inch 1080p three 1920 x 1080 across
running on jelly bean we've got some
kind of interesting UI elements that I
want to show you voting this hobby
screen which I still have to get
compressed and folds happen circle loop
engine
and then the little force field happens
and then you're immobile Zoma qu IL MS
Li light least owned by the s4 pro
quad-core chip this like we're saying on
the Teddy and even smart phones down
there a little bit of joy legged here to
see bouncing around we've gotta
interface it going to reminds us of we
knew I a little bit we bring down the
notification to the shortcut got these
kind of communities goggles very nice if
you like them but not very space
conscious that's what you can do here
you can rest edit you can add some of
your favorite apps just a little bit of
UI code of the most asian gear ZTE time
you click it done and you go back into
this guy you looking at some favorite
apps teaches medical right it doesn't
really call you il over here it was
always fun to see Android manufacturers
or something different because there's
this little guy in here and you bring
that out you get the home button the
multicast button we get the menu button
in the back fight sort of floating close
up so you don't have to look for the
buttons down here not exactly sure to
use these scenarios and this makes sense
but I imagine it just might make things
a little bit easier situations he wanted
to say beliefs again it's called me pop
not here it is uniquely uncheck that and
it is not
if you can see how they look along the
genome launching and we did notice some
you I'd like your maybe because it's
early software this isn't released yet
maybe in China soon again as much and
it's going to be released in the US on
what Kerry we don't know so here we go a
riptide lymphedema gakuen including
looking pretty good here on 1080p screen
let's see how frames are you're not
getting reflection on the screen there
are a lot of bad s4 pro always kicks ass
and see another main actually a budget
price with 1080p device by the time 2013
come around gen ed fees are gonna be
very very common and he's going to
probably end up at the mid range of our
budget us phone that's it for now with
the cts grande yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
