pocketnow.com and we're here with
Desmond and he's going to show us a
little bit about this new phone from
tmobile right so this is the new HTC One
S this has got a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED
screen beautiful ultra-thin industrial
design it's a unibody construction so
it's carved to have a single piece of
metal how many millimeters thick 7.95
nice
and key features we've got great
entertainment features like music
featuring play music from google
streaming uploading of up to 20,000
tracks and then streaming over
t-mobile's fast 4G network and with this
device we have built-in Beats Audio so
as you can see any audio output from the
device through a headset gets Beats
Audio integration so cleaner more
authentic sound bigger bass gota just
great great overall sound you can
actually turn beats on and off to hear
the difference device all right up in
here but it works not only with music it
would work with the YouTube videos it
would work with videos downloaded from
saying we play videos or a slacker
internet radio anything like cut so what
exactly just beats beats is a digital
sound processing so it does a great job
of increasing your bass response giving
better spatial awareness for the sound
of music
you know people liking it too is it an
equalizer setting we think it's a little
bit more than just that you get really
really rich clear authentic sound more
like the way the artist intended to have
the music beyond entertainment features
music videos things like that awesome
awesome camera features so with this
device you'll notice on the UI we no
longer have to toggle between still
images or video both both are presented
in the UI so you could actually start
recording a video and as you're
recording in full HD take still images
and it's capturing still images at the
same time you have other great features
around this fast capture you see how
quickly it's capturing or if I press and
hold get kind of that Gatling gun sound
where it's taking multiple pictures I'm
a frames per second roughly about five
and it will actually take up to 99
photos you see I pressed it for a few
seconds I've lost to choose from I
obviously don't want all those photos I
can go in
and clean out what I don't like keep the
good one or keep them all if I great
great camera features to be on that slow
motion video that does 60 frames per
second HDR and panorama all the great
camera features there as well as filter
features also
so we can live before you take the face
now you can actually preview it as your
focus I mean everything's very pink
around us right now magenta but if we go
in and try the different effects they
will give you a preview of real comedian
great device Ice Cream Sandwich sense
for what kind of things has t-mobile
added to this versus the normal HTC
branded version well beyond beyond what
sense offers which is great exchange
support great calendaring since four is
now a lighter version of sense a little
less chroma if you will are very fast
really speedy but still offers all the
great features from sense t mobile ads
and some great value added services to
mobile TV if you go in here my t-mobile
for account management
t-mobile name ID which is a caller ID
service visual voicemail a great feature
for our customers and then I've added a
few things myself support the UM a it
has it does have Wi-Fi calling it's
actually built on ims now oh yes Wi-Fi
calling as well and is one of our
fastest 40 to make phones so hspa+ 42
minutes on you download great great

peaks averages of eight to twelve you
want to show me a skin test already have
a history of skeezits to show me I look

we can get you can just show me the
history of BS I want to see it run see
where we get with a loaded room Evan
