all the way from Honduras for the first
time in a long while by multi media
manager hi mayor rivera good afternoon

very quickly and then sent it to jaime
and taylor mere minutes before you heard
our voices begin this show so episode 36
came together quickly because we got
some crazy news this morning but more on
that in a second i want to kick this off
with an announcement we have a really
really cool social media reinvention at
pocket now we finally shed our Chi
um I don't know what would you call it
have a uh um emily brodie our last our
last resort i remember when we opened
our twitter account and I you know I
opened our facebook page and Brandon
open our twitter account it was like man
I can't find twitter.com slash pocket
now it's already taken and then open
youtube.com slash pocket now it's
already taken it's like oh all right uh
what should we get it I'm like well I
don't know you tell me pocket out tweets
and he's like yeah why not yeah why not
nobody's gonna use this twitter thing so
we actually we have we're done now we
instead of pocket now tweets on twitter
we are just pocket now which is so much
better and instead has the youtube
change been made are we just pocket now
on youtube yes we are both of them still
work yeah we are as pocket now but still
those that have as a you know bookmark
this pocket now video it still works the
in twitter it doesn't and twitter it

to be on it Taylor you're going to be on
it right yep yeah we can't get away from
each other this week and Jaime are you
gonna be honored tomorrow no I I have
too much I'm completely swamped my
schedule is like I am I am here just out
of the you know when you send me the
invite I was like yeah I haven't been
there in a while I would love to eat
that's that's the only reason I'm here
but you know when you you wrote me I was
like can you be there I'm like no but
I'll be there see the thing is I knew hi
Mei was overloaded but i'm looking
through our roster and poor you know
adam just had surgery or whatever and
you know everyone else i've just been
talking to so much i just said we saw
brandon last week we you know tony and i
have just spent a minute we'll get away
from each other so Taylor sorry you get
to hang out with me again on the air
it's cool at least you can't ignore me
now so it's true I can't yeah I can't
just can't just look at your text and
kind of dispassionately put my phone
back in my pocket you are fired because
of the whole Instagram gig but you're
not ignored yeah yeah
on the other that that's not what I got
fired I got fired before telling him the
my official official PocketNow title he
didn't like it oh yes that's right i was
trying to figure out Taylor titled for
the intro and I was like what's your
title he's like I prefer to be called
keyboard master or keyboard king or was
it um god of the keyboard god of the
keyboards you know what you know what I
like that a little better now now that I
hear it now that it is my ear right um
but let's let's jump into stuff yeah so
I want when we jump into our windows
phone and our iOS categories today are
actually very small because most the
Bears share of the news I don't know if
that's an expression or not is in
Android for the past week but there was
a huge piece of Windows Phone news this
morning and do you guys know where I was
because I was not in the office um no I
don't know where I was I had already
planned to take the morning off this
morning to go do a freelance voiceover
gig so yeah yeah yeah so I'm there in at
MIT here in Cambridge Massachusetts and
i'm recording like this voiceover for
this guy from from the 1800's about MIT
and it's really fun good back in the day
there was no sand and it was all water
whatever it was much better than that
but i get this i'm looking at my news
feed between takes and I'm like a
windows phone just dropped for Pandora
what so I kind of rushed home and
whipped up this hands-on so that's the
news Pandora for windows phone 8 is here
and it's awesome I mean did you get a
chance to download it or no I'm just
you're gonna hate me for what I'm about
to say you know it's funny because I'm
jobel you know I yesterday in pocket now
daily I was you know I was talking about
uh I'm trying to remember what
application what it was for windows
phone and then at some point I was like
hey mr. Joe Belfiore worst Pandora we're
about done with the q1 and when you
promised that it was gonna be launched
and you know this morning we finally got
the news he's like oh I am so excited
we've got pandora and the first thing
your buddy does is he grabs his windows
phone 8x he starts downloading the
application and then he starts launching
it and then it reads a pandora is not
available in your country so and so i am
like
oh ok I've got a solution for that so I
start going into settings and I
completely remember that when those
phone does not have support for VPN
connections Oh see there is no way
around it there was no way around that I
have pandora on android through VPN
pandora and iOS through VPN but you know
windows phone you know my the microsoft
operating system the corporate company
that is into absolutely everything that
has to do with technology for
corporations and security and everything
they do not have VPN support on their
phone operating system just watching I'm
watching RV we have a we have a live
viewercount it's displayed on a 4-foot
steam gauge right in front of me and
it's just plummeting into the basement
as jaime starts his windows phone rand
we have 11 listeners left so please so
please you talk about I've got nothing
nice to say so mad you're so mad I would
be mad too I asked I think I asked Tony
to download and he's like yep can't
can't get it over here I was like dammit
and some commenters have started saying
that as well too and I'm sorry listeners
I didn't mention it in the video or in
the text that it's only available in
certain markets right now but i'll
probably go back and stick that in after
we're done recording here but anyway I
gave it a test drive and I was a bad
sounds interesting you say that I'm
because I was going to write a tldr
piece about how essentially saying hey
Microsoft where is Pandora you promised
it I was gonna do the same exact thing
that you actually did on the daily yeah
and then it dropped today so I took it
for a test drive it was only a first
impressions video so I only test drove
it for about 45 minutes but oh man it
it's it's just great I mean no I love
the design and I love the fact that it's
free i mean i love the fact that you get
the well you it's not job it's not like
free pen door it's it's pandora one it's
the paid subscription for free yeah
exactly exactly which is really awesome
and I thought it was confined to Lumia
phones when I heard about it months ago
but i guess not i guess it's all windows
phones now the question is i did hear
that there's a that there's a
restriction that you can only hear i
don't know how many hours I heard on
your video right yeah you're limited to
40 hours per month now that's for all
mobile platforms I was like so I don't
like that a blunt point router one point
25 hours a day
if you listen everyday to banner yet so
if you're if you're listening to pandora
eight hours a day you're not going to
make it through a work week but you
probably shouldn't do that on your phone
anyway why not the contrarian you know
it's a good question i don't know yeah
you want to burn through your battery
you want to burn through your data
allotment i don't know i don't know i'm
a spotify user so yes i'm a spot I'm
just wanna know my users as well so i'm
happy with the windows phone but it
comes to the beta of spotify it's
working great so i have no complaints on
that department i completely agree i
also don't have a windows phone 8 device
so yeah that's crazy you should have one
of those I've actually not used one I
used the windows phone 8x for I don't
know a couple days and that was it
really I didn't review it or anything I
just had it I pop the sim card in and
used it for like a day and then do
design I yesterday I I tried to squeeze
a replacement Lumia 920 out of an
associate of mine replacement Lumia 920
you you made me beg you to send me one
of those phones and you're telling you
have an extra one no I don't have an
extra one that's right I didn't succeed
but I thing is Jaime you will remember
this issue the Lumia 920 has some dust
behind a front facing camera like ah
don't remind me listeners listeners for
the record you guys are gonna gag me
here when we were building the after the
buzz video for the Lumia 920 you know
Michael had actually sent me everything
before he went to before he went to
Berlin but the problem was that I don't
member for what reason I couldn't
compile the video early enough and so I
I remember we did another video before
that is so and so he's like wait a
second I just found something I can
notice dust under the under the lens I'm
like oh my god this is terrible this has
to be on the after the buzz and I'm like
okay fine send it to me and then when I
put the video together and everything I
forget to add it and no it's and so my
mind will than that even better than
that with the night before they after
the budget is supposed to land we have a
pocket now live hangout from Barcelona
where we're talking about this we're
like guys tomorrow you're going to see
the after the buzz video is gonna be
great watch for the dust portion it's
really uh god it's awful and then i said
something like if hai mei forgets to add
it i'm just gonna kill him
something you literally did the next day
that guy was like I cannot believe you
know my god hey man it happens I've done
worse but uh anyway that's if you have a
windows phone 8 device check it out
pandora is to downloadable for free
considering that you get the
subscription service for a year it's
pretty cool that means you can I believe
it gives you if it's not unlimited skips
it's more skips but more more crucially
there are no commercials and that's
awesome and that is exclusive to to
Windows Phone so cool thing feather in
Microsoft's cap I also use Spotify but
just to have pandora Pandora's been
anticipated for so long on this platform
that it's really cool to have so go and
get it so it's fail Nate store go ahead
so if you've got a Lumia device how does
this really benefit you over nokia music
I mean I've been a pen door user before
I haven't really used nokia music so how
do they differ really so the thing is
with nokia music which i haven't used in
a little while thanks to spotify i'm
waiting for nokia music fire up some
I've got my 920 right here we got the
the rundown on the new nokia music
actually there's a hands-on video from
barcelona and i got to be honestly I
don't really remember what the
improvements were off the top of my head
but so right now people are jumping to
the video and like going to the comments
me like you remember but yeah so I don't
know I mean how does it differ into like
I've found Pandora's mixes to be better
okay they do get a little more stagnant
with time but yeah that's kind of what I
was Esther cuz yeah I mean I know
Pandora will play a bunch of different
stuff and then once you listen to it all
you hit the end after like two hours and
it all just repeats it's like listen to
listening to a local radio station
they're like best hits and then they
play twenty songs on repeat I don't know
I'm really whenever I put playlist
together mostly a general type of guy so
I have like rock on one playlist and and
stuff like that and I like the fact that
Pandora does a really good job in mixing
music I don't know they they I love it
for music discovery that's that's me
right
so and that's the thing like that's why
it's exciting to me because nokia music
yes you can make it learn you and it
works well and blah blah blah but
pandora already knows me you know i
already have my station set up I've been
using pandora since 2008 you know what i
mean so it's i think it's it's
advantageous and it's a big deal in that
sense yeah you know plus it's absolutely
one of the 46 out of 50 top apps that
microsoft was boasting about it there
when does funny at launch I'm being I'm
being fed a feta wire I've just got a
telegram in the in the mailbox here that
we got to talk about nokia solar
charging hymen I mean well I why do I
feel like you know what's going on with
this because I well it came out in the
in the news yesterday that Nokia tweeted
uh something saying son son here we come
and it's like you know it's been rumored
for awhile now that Nokia is working on
bringing solar charging to to their
Lumia to their future Lumia products and
you know I left it as a question of the
day yesterday on daily and I consider to
be very cool I mean I just find it
interesting that they're tweeting this
now and there are no events planned
until ooh probably the fall for nokia I
don't think they've ever had events
before that so i don't i don't think we
should get excited that we're gonna get
the technology yet but that's probably
just telling us hey you know Nokia's
working on it and hopefully it'll come I
feel you know wireless charging has
never taken off i mean if they'll bundle
it in a box with me then i'll use it but
it's not something that I'd pay money
for I yeah yeah and wireless charging is
is a good analogy right because it took
forever to catch on and it is starting
to catch on slowly here in the state
yeah but each solar charging I mean I
don't I think when I remember when when
the iphone 4 came out with the with the
you know the two glass the glass on
glass on the design and we were we were
thinking with brandon i was like what
are they going to innovate with the NEX
iphone which was eventually the iphone
4s and we're like men if they would fit
solar panels on that back glass that
would be like amazing because battery
technology has not evolved it is the
only technology that has not evolved I
mean yes we had nickel-cadmium batteries
on cell phones five six years ago a
hydride and yeah and now and now we have
lithium-ion polymer which are much
better than the ones we had before yes
true but the batteries have not shrunk
the problem is that the technology has
not allowed the batteries to shrink so
think of the opportunity to have a
smaller battery with a solar panel that
will charge the battery or would at
least leave the battery on or you know
simultaneously charging the phone with
that I think that would be really
awesome I think that's a cool solution
it's they're not the first yeah I
personally do this uh the moma home a
couple years ago yeah yeah the pool
phone and it would only trickle charge
oh you would tell me about that I didn't
know about that yeah do it it was the
Puma phone I can't remember who can't
remember soon actually manufactured it
ya know what did it run it ransom it ran
a dumb phone OS it wasn't a smart phone
right yeah it real oh it had like a puma
interface it had a date like turntable
app I don't know it was weird yeah I
remember that phone oh yeah basically
flip it upside down and it would keep
your battery where it was while you were
listening to music so if you're actually
using the phone there's not you I mean
obviously you can't use a phone in point
it towards the Sun because then you're
probably gonna go blind but yeah the
problem is that it even if you lay it
down the only way it's really gonna
charge at all is if you're not using the
phone right and at that rate it charges
in like oh I don't know eight hours yeah
no that's all but that book is like but
that's a that's a fair trade i mean when
you're muting when you're driving from
one point to another you're not using
your phone technically speaking or I i
s'posed of it you're not supposed to be
yeah um but I feel that you know there's
a good portion of time where your phone
is on standby and I think that's like a
really cool idea so yes I agree but but
is it worth the technological like the
development of resources and the
thickening of the phone and the
increasing complexity and the increased
cost you know it will just think about
it I mean how much how long has it been
for batteries to evolve we've got octa
core processors on phones or we will
eventually we've got more ram than them
phones would have ever had five years
ago but still battery technology has not
been able to shrink if you want more
battery power on your phone you need a
bigger bad
me that's just the way it is so is so
you know companies are struggling to
shrink the size of components in order
to fit bigger batteries so if they could
keep the current size batteries with a
solar panel somewhere around in the
design and i'm i'm holding the xperia ZL
right now and there are a lot of places
in this class frame on the sides where
they could definitely fit a solar panel
like the ones we saw in calculators 20
years ago so i think that's a cool i
mean you're talking about the ones that
were like half the size of a postage
stamp that one yeah like the puma phone
nobody a panel like the entire side of
the size of the back cover to even get
the rates we're talking about right
Taylor yeah and in those calculators if
somebody stood between your calculator
and the light they turned off true true
again but but obviously obviously the
phone is gonna have a battery so the
phone is gonna be on battery power when
it's on battery power and that's gonna
be on solar power when it's on solar
power I feel that it's a cool idea you
know out of all the gimmicky stupid
things that we've received in the past
couple of years that have never stuck
this is probably one of the most
ingenious e moves that I've seen so far
in in terms of battery there's at least
one technology i would rather see over
solar power or even wireless charging
and that's rapid charging i think the
idea was i can't remember the university
that had the breakthrough but basically
instead of charging through basically
you think of it as charging your phone
right now you charge through one single
little channel the way they did it is
you would charge through multiple
channels across the entire cell so you
could charge at like I think it was
hundred times the rate maybe more she's
at the same amperage so basically you
plug your phone up and it charges in oh
ten seconds Wow yes so you have a
ridiculous exactly so you have a three
thousand million power battery it takes
20 hours to discharge you plug it up for
10 seconds and you're good to go for
another day that I would I would be cool
IBM nobody is amazing and and they're
the technology is there they just have
to shrink it down because it was
designed for cars but they said that
consumer electronics such as phones and
tablets are not out of the question it
is totally possible because the
breakthrough was in how its
done not you know you're not the actual
methodology well well well hey hey
University whoever you are I mean there
there's a there's a current surge right
now for phablets manufacturers you crazy
you're in search I see over there /
unapologetic phones that are just sighs
in order to not fit in your pocket so
stop worrying about the technology being
too big just fit it in there it should
happen I'm surprised we went through
that whole segment without it that's
what she said joke maybe it's cuz
granddad's not on there man it's not on
me I don't know but I may just make my
galaxy note to feel self-conscious right
yeah let's let's move on before we
installed anymore phablet we let's jump
out of windows phone and happen to
android avatar right with everybody
because we have to talk about what
happened yesterday which was a special
edition episode of the pocket now live
yes the same pocket i alive that's
happening tomorrow except different
instead of a reader hang out we had a
hangout amongst some of us at pocket now
talking about the HTC one vs the galaxy
s4 vs the Sony Xperia Z and I think was
a or 2020 yeah yeah I think ultimately
at the end Brandon asked us for our
votes but the thing is um there was a
there was a very funny comment that
somebody left her in this train works
like you guys suck you guys you guys are
nowhere near as good as whoever because
because you guys are hostile hostile to
each other remember that you guys are
mean to each other and I was like you
know what I normally I just would have
liked discounted that I wouldn't have
even mentioned it but it's so funny
because I was I was so angry during that
hang out I would have been having some
internet problems at home so I couldn't
hear anybody nobody could see me and all
of us and then saw mad about that and
then my power goes out so I yeah so I
lost my connection entirely I had to
come back in in the dark as oz hi may I
just looked like a floating head and the
darkness oh it was absurd so I see it
was it was not the most perfect hang out
and I'm looking forward to having a
better time on the air tomorrow but we
we talked about a lot of stuff we talked
about those handsets and as Taylor said
yeah then Brendan ended up asking a
closing question which device we prefer
if we had
one for a daily driver between the s for
the HTC One and the Xperia Z which would
we choose and all four of us chose the
HTC One it was that point where I
thought wow we sure should have probably
had high me on this what would you pick
timing I think we're gonna talk about it
later on I wouldn't be our yeah we
definitely are well yeah talk about an
hour okay good just just tell me which
one you would have picked now because I
don't know ah man I was so disappointed
by the 1x otherwise the one okay okay so
here's the here's the point for our
listeners the 1x um here's the point for
our listeners I'm usually we get review
units and some of these review units we
have to return but some of them we we
get to keep we're lucky enough to keep
um and you aren't any longer people are
gonna start complaining the interest too
long yeah and then and then it comes to
for example in my case like iOS devices
iphones we have to pay for every one of
them that we review but in the case of
HTC phones these were also phones that
up to last year we had to pay for to be
able to review um and the 1x was
obviously one device that we can get and
I was like man I was so excited by that
phone busted Lorna I bought it you know
I coughed up the the five hundred fifty
bucks i bought the phone and man oh god
you know it was it was the perfect phone
until I took the first photograph and
for me it was so disappointing because I
mean I was I was sitting in front of
Peter Chou at the event and the guy was
like it's an amazing camera and he said
it's so credibly that I believe them you
know I left the place believing that
this was my next phone summer and I am I
am sorry to report that I you know I
want the HTC One for the record okay if
I had right now 600 bucks and I had a
galaxy s4 and a one and A one on the
table I want the HTC One it's a
beautiful phone it's the most beautiful
piece of aluminum that I've ever seen I
love the display on the one XO I know I
love this plan this HTC One I love so
many things about it but I hate the fact
that I'm gonna have to carry a phone i
won't be able to take photos with all
right but you know we were just talking
off the air before we started
about how you know the various merits of
Instagram and we're not going to do that
again because we do that unlike every
podcast but during that conversation you
mentioned that you are an Instagram user
and I know from experience that you do
post a lot of photos socially are there
also a lot of photos that you do not
post socially that you really need that
higher resolution for because oh just
speaking for myself I share almost every
photo I take okay so here's the problem
in my my country is not the safest
country on the planet so you can't
really just walk around with a
mirrorless camera down the street and
just take photos so for me my camera is
my phone um and you know I have a
mirrorless camera the NEX and I have the
t3i but I only take these cameras out
ever so often as I could just get mug
for the camera so for me my camera is my
phone and so obviously i use Instagram
not necessarily for for the filters i
use Elsa gram for the social filters for
the fact that i could just upload
everything to tumblr to to facebook into
Twitter with one tap and i'll have to do
it twice that's the real reason why i
use it sure and again over the cellular
network and it's getting compressed and
it's getting degraded anyway so it it is
getting the gridded anyways but I'm for
me sharing photos is not the real reason
I want a camera phone for me keeping
photos there are a lot of moments we go
to the beach with the kids we go to
these places and yes i'll upload
instagram photos but then i'll keep
these photos and these are the photos
that are that become my personal archive
of my family and so for me to have to
compromise again you know Brandon I'm by
the way we're putting together the
review right now and the agency one yeah
yeah i'm i'm halfway through it and you
know just the little teaser i mean it
picks megapixels do matter I mean I I
feel that the camera would have been a
genius move of they would have figured
it out and I I content I continue saying
the HTC One would have been a great
phone uh probably six months from now
when they would have figured that out
okay all right so is that that's my
point so my point is ok if I have to
pick I don't like the galaxy s4 more
than the HTC One I seriously don't I
prefer the design of the HTC One I just
simply hate the fact that I have to
compromise that for almost the same
amount of money I'm gonna have to carry
a second phone to take the photo
that I want to see hmm that's me that's
that's a good I you know I'm glad we had
a chance for you to hear your opinion
exciting i wanted you out I wanted to
hear from you yesterday but of course
you weren't weren't there and neither
was I for most of it you feel better now
do I feel are you asking me or how high
my I mean yeah okay okay so you feel
like a weight has been taken up okay so
so so tell me something guys um you guys
want an HTC One how so you are more
social about your photographs or or what
makes you want the HTC one aside from
the fact that it's a beautiful phone so
i will i'll jump in very quickly and
then i'll let Taylor answer I definitely
do take a lot of photos I love taking
photos of my lumia and I am NOT saying
that I wouldn't miss the added
resolution all I'm saying is I tested it
against the DNA I tested it against the
920 I saw how different it is yes it's
inferior in some circumstances it's not
inferior enough for me not to carry it
as a as my daily driver but then again
I'm captain two phones i usually have a
second phone anyway so really my opinion
is not worth anything to the average
consumer in this sense in the sense of
like what do you want to carry which is
why anytime somebody asked me on that on
twitter 14 times a day I'm like guys
this is not helpful to you also look at
my profile but I don't mean to sound
tonight I actually I love my followers
and I I appreciate the questions it's
just I'm just rambling Taylor go uh well
I was in the same shoes as you last year
but recently i switched from carrying
two phones down to one phone and I'm
actually having to deal with this for
the first time what i do what do i do
with a phone with a crappy camera
because it was always carry the iphone
use it to take all my pictures exactly
all i would use it for and then have an
android phone for everything else and
now I've consolidated and I carry an
ipad mini and a poem ah so Caesar for
the sort of consolidated well I mean I
don't I don't go around taking pictures
on my iPad good for you good for you too
I mean I do it on rare occasions like if
I need to take a picture of a document
or something i'll do it for records but
i don't go taking pictures with a knife
right um so yeah I'm having to do with
it for the first time and I'm with the
note 2 right now I've been with the
nexus 4 for two months now and I hate
every picture I ever take with it so I
just stop taking pictures same with the
note 2 and and the galaxy s3 and the HTC
One X I just don't like the quality of
the photos so I just don't take pictures
wow yeah if you're not like the s3 and
the node 2 photos then you're you're
pretty you've got a pretty sharp eye I
mean I think most people like those I
don't know the plea you know the prom
the problem I glizzy you're not
accustomed to the iphone 5 and and I'll
be honest I you're just not you know
I'll be honest with you I remember when
people would make fun of the iPhone
because it was a small phone i'm like
it's perfect cuz it's the small phone
that I keep in my pocket to take photos
and then I use the other phone for
everything else I was exactly like
tangling yeah in and that's the thing
like when people did those camera
comparisons and they were like the
galaxy s3 takes pictures almost as great
as iphone 5 my eyes like bulged out I'm
like what are these people blind like oh
my god and it's the compression level
it's the compression level exactly gosh
you don't have any detail there are no
edges and it just kills me and anything
yeah so I just stop taking pictures I'll
take pictures now with my note 2 or the
nexus 4 and I making black and white
because grain on black and white looks
fine hey you know what the funny thing
is Michael um that it is a software
thing you know it's something that these
companies have not figured out because
the iPhone 5 has this well the forest
has the same sensor as the galaxy s 3
and s is the note to it is the same
exact sensor made by sony and still i
mean you get like this fuzziness when
you zoom into a photo on these other
phones and you don't get it on the
iphone for some reason well it's in the
same sensor it's not the same lens right
right i believe it's well that's a good
question i have no idea yeah I don't
know we can I i am i'm a complete
amateur please do not take my word for
it i just you know going back to that
editorial that i wrote on the galaxy s4
has just made the HTC One obsolete yeah
cuz we don't work I wanted to lead that
in yeah yeah go ahead and talk about
that because I want to know you guys
have a okay so-so
what tell ya what I was gonna say could
I say one more thing about the cameras
though fire hey sorry uh the the HTC one
everybody's complaining about it being 4
megapixels and all these others being
you know larger and the problem is that
sure it's 4 megapixels and other phones
can kind of out shoot it in in certain
areas but all the others even at 13
megapixels on the the Xperia Z and has a
great camera iphone it 8 megapixels has
a great camera but even when you're
zoomed in they still all look kind of
crappy so so what's what's the point
what's the point in having a photo
that's two or three times as large but
looks just as bad it's just bigger you
are making i think i was listening
mostly and i think you have made my
point that I was trying to make before
and forgot to make when I compared the
HTC One to the DNA and the Lumia 920
whenever I zoomed in to the same degree
on both shots I did they looked just as
crappy to me I don't understand what I
mean okay so here's here's at least in
my opinion why um you will never print
out a photo in the full resolution of
what a camera can take you will usually
print it out at a much smaller size for
particular reasons obviously for
convenience you don't want a big photo
you know what a piece of paper with a
photo and on a display it's the same
it's the same way the reason why I don't
like the for my problem is not really in
the quality of the camera on the HTC One
because I've noticed the photos aren't
bad when it comes to color reproduction
my problem is what happens when I have a
Retina Display computer and for the
record guys this is not a problem on
tablets for some reason computers are
kind of wacky in the way they handle the
retina display they'll tell you that
there that they are these amount of
pixels but they're really quadruple that
size and so the problem is you try to
look at that photo on on this computer
and it crops it crops horribly I don't
know it looks terrible it looks fuzzy so
what's the what's the advantage of
having more megapixels well that that
fuzziness will be harder to see
everything looks fuzzy on the macbook
pro on the retina I've had one for a
week now or two weeks I don't even
remember but like a 700 pixel wide photo
is literally like an
and a half across yeah it's like yeah
all right what I don't wanna yes yeah
all right so yeah I know yeah you've got
a new macbook pro which I'm pretty happy
about you at you for I can't make that
sentence because I don't mean it I hate
you i'm very jealous i'm happy yeah you
but here's the thing viewers you
listeners you can absolutely see for
yourselves what these cameras are like
we have a bevy of youtube videos we have
comparisons on pocket now check them out
there's so much coverage on the HTC One
it's ridiculous and eventually we are
going to have to move off of it but
before we do I would like to hear Taylor
and I'm a road dueling editorials I'm
just basically the galaxy s4 just made
the HTC One obsolete the galaxy s4
didn't make the HTC One obsolete out at
all okay so cool headlines cool
positions hi Meg you are just chomping
at the bit go ahead okay so um in the
case of in the case of why did it make
it obsolete the problem with the problem
with HTC is always I I've said it so
many times on the podcast HTC is the new
blackberry it's like you you get this
but you don't get other things and I it
really pisses me off I feel that Samsung
gives me more for my money you know I
don't have to worry if the if the
battery is not going to work well within
the next three months because I could
just swap it the resale value of my
phone is going to be much much larger on
a galaxy s three or four than it is on
an HTC One because the battery is not
replaceable because I can expand storage
what if I want to carry a ton of movies
right now and then I don't want these
movies and I want music eventually I
don't have to think about that what a
galaxy s4 I have to think about that
with an HTC One so for me you know I
think that we're gone away from it's
funny because we're going into the
position where phones are getting
thinner and smaller and they're getting
non replaceable batteries with that
excuse and then Samsung shows everybody
how it's done so for me that's the one
thing the second thing you know I talked
about the choice of materials and the
reason why did that is because I
remember when I filmed the after the
buzz of the iphone 5 my phone had no
chips no scratches no nothing
but it's been three it's been almost
four or five months since I had this
phone and I have no clue where the heck
did I get the chips on the phone but
they it's full of them yeah I was riding
in a car one day and I had my iphone 5
without a case sitting on the seat and I
hit the brakes kind of hard and it slid
onto the floor board which is just a
rubber mat nothing sharp or dangerous
there and before it went on that sat
down in the car there was no blemish on
the corner I did that I picked it up and
there was this huge I mean huge gash in
the corner of my phone and I'm thinking
from what all it hit was a rubber mat no
rocks nothing so yeah that that's the
downside to aluminum as that it chips
and blemishes really really poorly
easily yes oddly so how may yes so so
aluminum is so is aluminum a better
material than plastic of coarseness of
course it is does it feel better in the
hand of course it does does it age
better than plastic is the question and
sadly the responses no I could show you
my galaxy s3 I could show you my galaxy
note 2 and they look exactly as I pulled
them out of the box no case used and the
cool thing about the galaxy s4 is if I
scratch the back I just get a battery
cover that's pretty much it i just
replaced the battery cover and i don't
have to worry about my phone looking
like if I loan it to my three-year-old
son so you know I feel that you know the
problem with aluminum is it does not age
well that's the problem I mean I had an
htc inspire 4G aluminum is not new it's
been there for a while HCC has done that
interval and Motorola did a long time
ago 3 exactly exactly in the problem is
it does not age well is it the perfect
material for smartphone I debated sadly
and finally for me uh my third point is
megapixels you know right what you'll
recover yeah yeah we did but you know
bottom line is i feel that ultrapixels
are the future fine but they're not here
yet so I saw the future not the present
hi Rivera not the present so like it's
ovah get get me an 8 megapixel eight
ultrapixel camera and then we'll talk
but right now I feel that the gallatin
it's funny because the galaxy s4 could
prob
would be actually lesser in technology
when it comes to megapixels against
ultrapixels but it ends up looking
better than the ultrapixel so what's the
point tail ends up looking bigger yeah
you're uh you're on your counter points
well okay Wow okay um well I'm gonna
stay out of the materials battle for now
until we have an adamantium phone when
that happens sure Wolverine get some
unobtainium yeah so I don't know Amy I
have a galaxy s3 here and i have an HTC
one x and i have a galaxy note 2 the
note 2 I it's been mine the entire time
I got it straight from Samsung Exynos so
not just samsung but Samsung Exynos they
sent it to me and allowed me to keep it
it is in pristine condition there are
some scratches on the button though so I
guess purse teens a little bit of a lie
the galaxy s3 has nicks scratches cuts
gouges all over it I don't know who used
it I got it from Joe Levi but it's
cleaned up you set everything right
there I got it from Joe and ask him ask
him for his nexus 4 as well oh and the
1x that I have I used it for six months
beat and banged it around through it
around didnêt I didn't use it in a case
or anything and it has one tiny little
nick that's barely noticeable on the top
edge of the phone that's polycarbonate
it's Carly carbonate not the
polycarbonate that Samsung uses the
polycarbonate that Nokia uses and it is
by far by and large my favorite
smartphone material ever ate but why I
absolutely love it and I hate that Sam
or Samsung I hate the HTC moved away
from it so do you think that they did a
good enough job on the aluminum do you
think that they're gonna the aluminum's
going to hold up better as a result of
their history with the 1x is that why
you bring that um no my point is that
plastic and and metal still damaged and
it just depends on how you treat your
phone personally I've had more luck with
what plastic that Samsung uses but I
the same respect they're all going to
damage and I'm probably going to end up
using it in the case if it has metal so
that that point is kind of moot I guess
but the megapixels we've we've talked
about that the big point is everybody
kind of talks about expandable memory or
storage and replaceable batteries those
are two things that don't matter to me
whatsoever I'm not going to carry around
spare batteries I explain this on on our
hangout yesterday I'm on pocket now live
I don't carry spare batteries because I
don't stick with a single phone for any
amount of time I mean I might use one
for six months but the next one I might
use for two weeks and then switch to
something else so buying spare batteries
is kind of useless because I have all
these battery packs so battery charge
there's with egregores feet I have I
don't even know how many Tony begged me
for some external battery charger yeah
yeah battery charge and I have power
bags I have a power bag to power bags so
why I'm just I've just got a question
then so like I mean yeah we have very
specific usage case use cases right
right and I happen to be in this
instance on your on your side I think
that the HTC One has not been obsoleted
by the s4 but listening to these two
arguments just sitting back as i'm doing
it's very easy to see why people would
agree with hi may I mean it is more
utility in the s4 there seems to be
there's more implied durability so what
other reason is the is the one not
instantly relegated to the dustbin of
history um that's a really hard question
to answer because I mean it yeah it
depends on your personal use cases and
for many there are a lot of people
saying that the s4 is just not
impressive not something that they'd
want and I tend to agree well the other
point so our trucks I mean trucks are
not impressive but they have more
utility I mean that's that's the point I
think that's I think that's gonna agree
with it I think that's the point I think
that's the point you know well i think
that the other thing that I was going to
mention is is storage and I just wrote
an editorial this and just published it
just before we started recording and
micro SD card slots aren't as great as
they used to be we all used to complain
when people
started not using microSD cards in their
phones and it was a problem because you
could move your applications over to the
SD card slot you know they had some kind
of core function with the operating
system but now there's no way to do that
anything you store on your device if you
get apps games movies from google play
stream your music through google music
or even like spotify where i download my
playlists from you know my account on
spotify everything is stored on device
anything that you want to store on a
micro SD card slot has to be either
something you already own your own music
your own digital movies your own
documents and things like that so really
that's really the only utility of a
micro SD card slot is storing your own
stuff that you already have which can
take up a lot of storage and it's ways
it's good that they're there but but if
you have a whole lot of on device
storage that solves the problem just as
well as what you're saying exactly so i
buy all my movies from google play all
of my music i stream from google music
or Spotify and games apps they can't be
moved over to SD card so basically an SD
card that serves no purpose for me
whatsoever none absolutely nothing in
that man and that's that's your usage
scenario example in my case I learned a
trick on how to pull my music from
Spotify to the SD card and that's the
reason why you know I use it I find that
x I find it super cool because you know
whenever I move from one phone to the
other i move the SD card all my music
from spotify is moved to the other one
you know it's all you have to do is read
download and then actually just the text
the music and it goes again but you know
obviously when I when I wrote the
editorial probably my my perspective was
more of a person that would have to
cough off 650 bucks for the fur
whichever phone and we'll have to use it
for two years and you know I feel that
the galaxy s4 will be a better
investment in the long run um in my
opinion obviously then you know in their
cases where they're just gonna have one
phone where if something goes wrong
within six or eight months with the
battery they're not going to have send
it to repair like they would have to
with the HTC One they would simply just
have to swap the battery out and that
would be it where if they're down the
road and they keep buying music with
two years um or they keep taking photos
and video within these two years they
could just send some of this send some
of the videos and photos to the SD card
and therefore not have to worry of
having their phone not fit for
absolutely everything that they'll do in
that two year time span that's probably
yeah that's probably there is solution
it's like Taylor is the one who told me
about a particular solution for this
called Wi-Fi file explorer which allows
you to move content without cable and
especially on a Mac where Android file
explorers don't really work ok well you
know you can you can boot you still move
content off a device that doesn't have a
rouble SD card that's cool you know what
I mean it's good to know that you have
options anyway so in in my case that is
a strong feather in the cap of any phone
that doesn't have removable memory just
from I for my use case I think microSD
cards in some ways if you're not a power
user and I'm gonna get a lot of hate for
this might be an antiquated concept your
games got a point have you got hungry
and I know you made that point anyway
but yeah everything that I like pictures
I back them up twice every picture I
take on a phone is backed up to Google+
and Google Google+ as a day yeah about
to say it again um everything I take
every picture I take on a phone is
backed up to Google+ and Dropbox right
so once my phone starts to get full I
just just delete it delete them all of
them just wipe it and go and we're gonna
see more of that as we move more toward
the cloud I want to bring it back down
to these two these two phones and and
and my thing is this i think to answer
my own question in a kind of oblique way
samsung is going to absolutely kill it
on sales of the s4 we go we all kind of
know that oh yeah you know it they have
the marketing dollars that that HTC can
only dream of and the resources in that
respect but i think samsung has you know
intentionally as part of their plan did
not iterate to it iterated very timidly
with the s4 and as a result all the buzz
they tried to generate a radio city
music hall with all the fluff you know
it came to an event yeah which we're
going to talk about in a second but the
phone itself is does is not all that
buzz worthy and the HTC One compared to
its previous iteration the droid DNA and
even
they're back to 1x is it is a much more
bombastic phone it's a much more
noteworthy device and I think
considering all the awesome reviews it's
getting it's going to sell quite well
and considering that it's on every US
national with the exception of verizon
for right now you know that's that's as
long as long as I could start selling it
as long as I can they can move it and I
think they will and i think the HTC one
is I have high hopes for it in terms of
bringing HTC back from the kind of not
the brink of failure but you know what I
mean as long as they can get some
components exactly yeah because they
have to be able to build the damn thing
but so so so there's that right but even
though even if they can't meet orders I
mean that's going to be embarrassing for
them but also that has a tendency to
raise the buzz as well no matter who you
are it does look for it does if you
don't have a galaxy s4 launching a month
from now you ready right now is the
moment where they have to figure out
supplies somehow but no I don't think
people I think that these are
sufficiently different than people who
are going out specifically for the HTC
One are not going to be like oh well you
don't have them in stock okay I'll get a
galaxy s4 I think they're so different
that oh oh but but but here's the
problem i mean for us educated users and
obviously our listeners that we have a
certain different level than the average
user that's the problem for us we know
what we want and we know what we want to
buy and we're just going to stick to it
but then the average user which hcc
wants the grass right now they're gonna
be pretty much they're going to be you
know taken by marketing if HTC will not
publish the phone on time I mean if they
see the phone on a counter and they get
to hold it they're going to see such a
beautiful piece of aluminum there
they're gonna want to buy it but if they
don't have it there because it's not
available to be sold yet and it's still
delayed then you know I think HTC is not
in the position to put up with that
right now they really need to get this
phone out somehow they need to get it
out before the galaxy s4 launches yes
yes I feel I feel that they have to
figure it out same time he made me wish
I was helping a month before so and they
got the 1x out well before the galaxy
has three we saw that worked out but
this is a different situation this is a
totally different situation yeah it'll
be interesting to see how this plays out
and I
I want to move on from this because
we're going to be low on time and we're
going to be talking about this exact
same thing I'm sure tomorrow on the live
with readers but let's talk very briefly
this has been talked to death because of
the scheduling of this podcast this is
now week old news I don't want to talk
about it for very long but just for a
couple minutes you guys watched the live
stream of the Samsung event yep um did
you now I admit I did not watch the
record of your live stream so uh how how
dare you react I know a jerk I was in
Oklahoma give me a break how did you sir
how did you survive that event man
seriously it was very difficult and you
know what's funny like normally I'm
normally Brandon's the one at events
where he's just like you know all you
guys I try to be and be positive because
for some damn reason and all you guys
are always like now it's crap and like
now might be cool whatever just hang on
but at this event I was totally like I
was leaning over to Brandon every 10
minutes at one point I leaned over Dome
after being subjected to like minute
upon minute of this tap dancing
six-year-old making cutesy smiles and
these we've female archetypes and
stereotypes and these cheesy smiles and
laughs that I just leaned over to him I
was like I can't take any more stick I
want to leave they're not showing me
features they're trying to distract me
from the fact that there aren't many
features I want to go I hate it hated
the event I absolutely couldn't stand it
and what about you guys yeah I had it on
about twenty percent volume while I
talked with everyone else but even then
I was like wow I'm gonna mute this and
just watch yeah it was bad um it was
more about the show I wrote an editorial
about this yesterday I always get into
this this groover I'm like yeah I wrote
this editorial wrote that in oh you say
yeah you say the same thing on the show
wasn't busy making last minute videos
yeah go ahead it's more about their
appearance how they come off through
this multi-million dollar announcement
event and didn't have much to show and
they did they covered that up with I
don't even know role play
yeah I want to I want to make it clear
before I know how many of something to
say but I want to make it clear that for
all my you know vitriol about this I
respect samsung for doing it I
understand why they did it and they
certainly it came off it they executed
it acceptable it just wasn't the right
tone it wasn't the way it was so
transparent and it was so mawkish and it
was just you know you don't do that for
that audience for you get 3,000 people
in the room yeah and and you it was just
the wrong audience for it and I remember
reading all the comments on Twitter and
stuff like that other from people
watching it from afar like is the
audience not Mike's like why can't we
hear any laughter clapping because there
wasn't any it was that was the most dead
theater I'd ever been in that had that
many people in it if it were a run on
stage a whole lot of note a dead room is
like and it was just so painful I felt
so bad for the actors go ahead if you if
it were a room full of basic consumers
who knew nothing about technology it
probably would have been the best it
would probably been a grand slam well
they probably blown it out of the water
absolutely yeah but it were it was it
was a room full of tech press and jaded
angry bird why are we here yeah yeah
where's the free food right okay I never
want to get to that point but yet so so
so yeah I mean I think it was it was
just improperly targeted and and that's
that's a shame because you know I talked
to some Samsung people you know we
talked to so many people at Samsung and
at other companies after events we know
these people and you notes I don't ever
like to see people who I like and it
like how was the show and I don't want
to tell him like I really didn't like it
very much but you know so but but that's
you know sometimes you know you did
there's a way to do that without being
mean and it's like you know what I just
don't think it was properly targeted
that's all I don't know I feel that you
said it right it's one properly targeted
and you know I remember that we were I
was repairing the commercial for our
pocket now live stream and you know i
published the commercial on daily and
then i was like oh god Samsung's got a
live stream and I'm like oh man we're
gonna pretty much compete with Samsung
and
in our pocket a live episode I'm like oh
well I audience will probably not be the
best but we're still gonna do it I feel
that people want to hear our opinions
when things happen yeah and pretty well
you know it turned out so well that
that's been our best day in pocket now
history our best traffic day our best
traffic day in pocket now history
listeners viewers thank you very much
for that we appreciate the audience you
know you have no idea how much effort it
takes for us to get this right and we
really do it to you know to bring you
the best opinion the best our best
efforts on what we think of what's going
on and I remember as the event was
happening that all the comments were
flocking in like men I'm lucky in the
pocket now stream a lot more oh man
thank god there's this parking now
stream yeah I was trying to read the
comments while we were streaming and
they were just flying by like I had
automatically up the update on YouTube
and literally I couldn't read him it was
just scrolling constantly like one of
those really fast credits on a movie oh
yeah they that were they stole to get
the next show in see I'm like wow but
since I was again I was worried that we
were not gonna have much of an audience
but as it turns out I mean Samsung this
is a big favor but but you know go go
into the point i think you said it right
and i think we set it as well in in in
our live stream we were all disappointed
I mean we didn't want uh at a galaxy 3s
yeah as Taylor would say we don't want
with it what a galaxy 3 as we wanted a
bold phone you know I think that the
GALEX not a blackberry bold yeah I think
I think well if you remember the
original black variable was a very bold
phone ballet yeah it was really awesome
it was a bold move from blackberry and I
I think that in this case HTC has made a
very bold move even even Apple made a
bold move with the iphone 5 they finally
changed their design and i feel i feel
that samsung did the same with the
galaxy s3 and I you know we're going
through this yes yeah yeah we're going
through the same problems when the apple
released the iphone 4s right yeah that's
like oh god I means like come on we were
so surprised by the four we wanted
something great for the 4s
I think you know I think Nicole got us
now go ahead dillish the singularity
about the galaxy s4 got us we were
talking about the event then the phone
came with its angry hand and yeah right
that's backward yeah that's what I was
going back to I was going to say I think
the biggest thing that I bet just I
think the biggest thing that just killed
it for me was knowing what it was before
hand because yeah the iphone 4 we knew
absolutely nothing about the iphone 4s
going into it and we thought it's gonna
be the iphone 5 this is gonna be awesome
and then we were just how they go it's
the 4s okay I guess that's cool and then
then last year we had no clue what the
galaxy s3 was no clue we knew some specs
we have no one's what it's going to look
like yes we go into it and we're like
wow that's amazing and then this year
we're like oh it's kind of the same
thing yeah so so that's the biggest
letdown is that you know if you could
keep it a secret it might be a little
bored impressive but the fact that we
knew every last detail about that phone
every last detail the features
everything before it was announced kind
of killed it and that's then you get
into that whole discussion about like
well our is anybody doing a real real
service by like reporting on these leaks
and all that kind of stuff and then
there's a whole philosophical discussion
and that of course we are and of course
we all right yeah yeah I don't mean I
don't mean leaks I don't mean like
breaking leaks I mean like reporting on
other people's stuff and reporting on
speculation and all that stuff and of
course that's the business but yeah
whatever if there's something more more
impressive than you really have it
unlocked down as a company I feel and I
just you know they didn't really have
any reason to for this and whatever it's
going to sell very well the event
generated a whole lot of discussion
there's a whole nother sub conversation
going on about the event about the kind
of misogynistic caricatures of women
that was legitness yeah you know I don't
want I don't want to get into that too
because we'll be here all night and I'll
fall asleep because like that's they're
not because I'm not interested in that
kind of stuff but there's just so many
levels it's so incredible my HP TouchPad
won't shut up i'm sorry but i know i
mean there's a really there's some
really cool discussion about what a good
event is and what constitutes a good a
good event and whatever that debate will
continue I think Samsung is to be
commend
for for throwing a lot of resources into
into an event I just don't it definitely
wasn't the event for me so uh it's
anybody else it like when somebody
google talk to you all the time like
like repeatedly is that sound just the
most infuriating thing in the world I
thought I thought I was alone in that oh
I don't know what sound you know a lot
of different sound cuz we'll talk like
blue key you know that I hey it's all
those alone on the browser I hate gasps
I can't do I cannot do it like it's just
hate that doesn't matter who it is it's
just like I hate this out now I love the
sound on Android the the Google Talk
sound on Android I do love that one mmm
i got i replaced on my notification
sounds with Star Trek doorbells so uh
let's uh let's move on because we are I
kind of wanted to be in listener mail by
now so I just want to touch on these
last two things in and remit here um I
don't anymore actually I don't want to
talk about Sony anymore because now we
we talked about Sony a lot now yeah I
don't think it's worth it my xperia ZL
review will be in shortly and I think
I'll just go through it anyways good i'm
there there's just so much beauty and
disappointment as well and when it comes
to the motorola codenames uncovered i
think the only cool thing about that
news is the fact that apparently we will
be getting remember the the HTC phones
on a cart editorial Michael totally yeah
build your own phone well apparently you
know Guy Kawasaki was an apple
evangelist back in the old Mac days hey
man I have a sake back in samsung event
of last year cool he's hot well he's
hired by google to bring some mojo back
into motorola you know the guy wrote
this book about enchantment you know he
did a really good job in making the mac
something that people want to buy back
in the time when nobody wanted a
computer um but so the idea is that this
guy is trying to rebuild the the concept
of motorola and apparently what he's
trying to do is make phones
personalizable which i think it's genius
i mean just they'll bring out three
different phone types and then you
select what processor you want what
color you want what type of the splay
you want I think it's genius those are
them well those are the rumors and the
guy just set it on google+
yesterday that you know wouldn't it be
cool to have a phone that's
personalizable that was on his Google+
yesterday yeah that's a concept that's
been tried before if I'm now actually
Michael wrote about it a couple a couple
of months ago I won't had this
conversation on the podcast before to it
but I'm talking about maybe about two
and a half years ago someone tried this
some company and then they just kind of
nose dived before they ever got off the
ground but yeah the idea is genius it's
always awesome we currently do it with
computers in is to a certain extent but
how how will they keep up with the the
constant innovation that's the problem
is you sell some on this phone it's
gonna have to come at a premium price if
you're ordering it you know to your own
spec so you you what are you gonna pay
800 900 dollars for this phone and we
all right we already pay we already pay
that for an iphone 5 with 64 gigs of
storage anyways 900 one of my bait I
paid for that I paid my mom my mom and
her husband do so sing it but you you
you know you're burning me out like that
Samsung commercial where the guy's
parents are sitting on the line for the
iphone and they're like oh we saved your
seat and he's like oh I moved on top
rated and oh don't bring up Samsung her
mercilessly either like on a slow
podcast week I was gonna throw that in
there I wanted to write a whole
editorial about how Samsung's commercial
search is the worst but it but they're
the worst but but I like them and you
know bottom line is if Motorola is able
to pull this off um I don't think that
Motorola has the the brand power anymore
to actually make it den but I would love
for them to start something with other
companies google has the brand power to
make yet and then they're gonna give
over roll up will eventually become
synonymous with Google well I think that
in google hills if google kills the
motorola brand and just uses this as
their smart phone company i will they
kill I if this is the google phone the
google g1 or the google g2 or whatever
that would be awesome because i don't
think Motorola's got the brand power
anymore all right but here's the thing
like coming from an American perspective
like I think it kind of depends on where
the national discussion goes here
because motorola as i've said before on
the show is a is one of the
bastions of like American technological
mm-hmm worth agree we get so many of our
handsets from overseas like it's the
only you know national company of course
Google is a much more powerful brand but
but I think motorola you know it's been
around since the 30s yes so it has that
that the cachet with them at least with
with older folks certainly and with with
people like like me who've used to work
with them closely so I don't know I
think that they will keep the motorola
brand around at least for another few
years and i don't know what looking down
the road we'll see what they do yeah I
kind of take that back and I wouldn't
like to see motorola died but i would
love to see branding nearly neither like
google branded phones yeah and they
neither would I I mean I own like 10
Motorola phones before i move to a
smartphone and i love those things and I
just feel that Motorola either well I
think they're doing a good job they
hired Guy Kawasaki I mean he's a
marketing guy I feel that he could
probably pull some stunts that her are
necessary for motorola to win back its
limelight yeah let's so if i can okay go
ahead yeah let's not let's talk about
let's talk about iOS Before we jump in a
listener mail because I don't want to
skip listener mail again because I'm
good ones do we have to yeah so this iOS
update that was supposed to fix this bug
doesn't write as no no it was just it
was just sent out there to kill the
jailbreak please listeners viewers do
not update iOS 6.1 point 3 it is not
worth it and if it kills your
possibilities to get a jailbreak it has
already been uncovered that it does not
fix the lock screen bypass which you
know I think it's just terrible so just
don't upgrade it's not worth it boom
boom topic taken care of and finally
much more interesting to me and this
closes out our primary topics google now
more likely than not coming to iOS i
don't know that i don't know if that's a
good thing yeah and the reason and the
reason why is just imagine yourself
having to search for the application in
order to be able to launch the service
because an iOS everything is on apps you
can't just do it it like on android
where you just pull it out from a
gesture trum you can't if you jailbreak
what you were just talking about
yeah in stock implementation though
you're right you'd have to search the
app and that's a that's a pain you know
we don't know what iOS is going to do
going forward we don't know what kind of
changes they're going to make to their
to the platform and also even if it is
confined to a nap i think google now is
so compelling and it's so critical to
Google's future that if it's not on iOS
and that's a real big problem for them
going forward so yeah yeah I had the
thought a while back thinking you know
they've got google search on here why
can't I just have google now on my
iPhone or my iPad so that that's
something I'm really looking forward to
google now I use it every single day for
all sorts of things i buy from amazon
several times a week sometimes and yeah
just cheating that that package shipment
notification and Google now between the
package shipping notifications and my
like a flower confirmations yes yes yeah
it's just crazy without even asking for
it on you know I think they're onto some
real magic there I think that's the real
future of that company great or a very
big part of it that was a little you
know so i get i get my nevada saloon
updates on on google now so i love that
nice did you get your jersey oh thank
you yes thank you very much i picked up
a personalized barcelona FC barcelona
jersey for 4 i'm a pert his request when
we're at at mwc let's uh let's jump in a
listener mail so we got some good stuff
and then we got to get going because
we've all got work to do as usual this
first one comes from our friend king who
who greets us by saying hello michael
brandon joe Tony Taylor or whoever's on
the next podcast apparently not Jaime so
how may you just tell I love this what
do you think what do you guys think
about water or dust proofing he asks I
love this question because I'm playing
with the Kyocera torque right now I'm in
the middle of the review period for it
so waterproofing has been high on my
mind King says the extra resilience
comes with a price worse screen due to
the coating flaps everywhere but what if
there were port screen technologies that
made them waterproof straight from the
production line no protectors no coats
no annoying flaps I'm personally
surprised there aren't any yet or maybe
Taylor knows of something not the rest
of us just Taylor
the King how also how much more would
you guys pay think HTC one with
waterproof plus dustproof so and he says
the Xperia Z inspired us to inspire them
to ask us it's dudes I want to just talk
to this both at CES and at mwc we saw
companies like Liquipel and the other
company whose name I cannot remember I
can never remember the other company who
do exactly this they don't rely on flaps
or gaskets or things like that they just
apply like an atom thick you know nano
coating to the edge of the boards of the
phone and that way if the phone falls
and it gets immersed in water it's not
hurt it floods the casing floods but the
phone doesn't care because all the
electronics are insulated so this
technology is out there and those
companies are working with carriers or
manufacturers to to build it into the
phones at the production level and
Liquipel will add it for you after the
fact to go ahead tell her um I was
trying to look it up I've got it right
here it'll take me a second yeah the
other company yeah the other company is
I can't find it Nana water repellent hco
hco HZ oh yes with water block yeah um
that was CES last year that they
announced their products oh yeah and
they were there again I guess in p2 I as
well I think they're a bit confirms out
there that are doing this and there was
one way back in the day back when
blackberries were still a thing uh um
called it was gold something I can't
remember go on medicated powder yes it's
gold one okay good it was like it's like
gold dust or something I can't remember
but it was basically just a nano coating
technology that you would put on the
internals of the phone and it protects
it from everything so yeah so this stuff
is out there and I think we're gonna see
this you know become increasingly
prevalent as as phones like the Xperia Z
come out and draw people's attention to
the fact that note you don't need it you
don't need a kyocera torque to have a
water-resistant phone it can be Gandil
beautiful you don't have to have flaps
over every port yeah that's what kills
it for me I don't care about it because
I don't want to have to open a port
every single time I
my phone in which is why which is why
wireless charging wireless charging yeah
why would Sony do that why oh I don't
know I I feel that at this day and age
why aren't every single phone waterproof
I mean they should be they should be I
mean it's just / that's where we're
going i mean i think that's that is the
future I really do and I think it's
gonna be through methods like this
instead of methods like the old-school
you know a gadget type thing so yeah
that's the only reason why I wanted that
H atrix HD remember Michael it was
because of the nano coating oh the atrix
HD yeah oh yeah you're this phone is
waterproof just put it in the ziplock
bag first like that that's that's what
we're dealing with right now happy
exactly fireproof just keep it out of
open friend let's uh continue to deter
listener this is Gregory the
instructions you're gonna be all right
Jaime and we killed hi max this is we
have another another repeat listener
mail for this is from neo from china i
love i love this hello my name is in
chinese so you can just call me neo i
love it i love when people know that i
can't pronounce anything O'Neill should
take the blue pill yeah what if i told
you neyo says I've been listening to
your podcast episode 15 thank you neyo I
would appreciate it and he wants to
share some stuff and I wanted to read
this on this episode I was going to hold
it for Tony but it Anton was not here
but he should be for this but neo says
he just wants to share about tablet
telephony inside his country he says I'm
from Singapore and apparently in my
telco they actually sell tablets as
phones with a fixed contract the price
has don't have much of a difference to a
normal phone and so we'd like to ask
about telephone capabilities on tablets
and apparently then I neos telephone
company released the Galaxy Note 10 dot
one with the phone feature in place
which I didn't know existed I'm okay
with that as long as you use it with a
headset yeah the question is what tablet
size would be acceptable to have a
dedicated earpiece and telephone I mean
you know and that was fun acceptable
none
yeah not a moment but for me absolutely
none i would never carry a tablet as a
phone but but but Tony would Tony's
obsessed with the idea you know I think
that it was right the company that it
right was a sous with the PadFone you
get a big tablet and then you get a
stylus that you can that works exactly
yeah it's really I listen to the talk on
your 10 get out of here no I like
Heather than reading a 10 inch tablet up
your heads it is it better or is it just
another flavor of awful another flavor
of all whoa just think about it it's
like using a Bluetooth headset I mean I
feel that as long as they figure out a
way to give you an earpiece that's not
the tablet that makes sense except you
look like a moron holding a pin up your
head like a moron either way talking
into a pin think about this for a second
you're talking me into a pin get smart
from the sixties or so you look I got it
like James Bond implement but here's the
thing right like we all look stupid at
some points and most of us don't care
and that's what a lot of these comments
that I actually love those comments or
it's like guys I don't care how stupid
do you think I look I like using this
product away I like using it and so you
know f off and Michael look like crazy
staring at his wrist for three hours
trying like one email exactly I look
like a moron checking my watch literally
every two seconds when like I'm in a
Twitter blast and people are like dude
you have enough time yeah I'm making fun
of you because my pebble has or hasn't
come in yet I know yeah well the thing
is like you know it doesn't matter you
everyone needs to get the products that
would that work for them and so Sonia I
mean man if go for it just whatever it
is but he's got a second question I go
ahead if that 14 inch Windows 8 tablet
works for you as a phone if you want to
hold that up to your head by all means
absolutely um I'll hope my macbook pro
up to my head for a call so India neo
has a galaxy tab 7 plus and he's you
know I'm just kind of asking generally
should OEMs make a push towards creating
a an interface for one-handed usage in
7-inch tablets see that's where I think
I would draw the line I would say no if
if you want to use a product in a manner
like that like yeah first of all it's
really really difficult unless you have
massive hands but also like more
importantly I don't think OEM should
should strive to Japan der to a very
small subset like if if there's an issue
factor out there that just wants to make
like seven inch smart
phones then you know go for it more
power to them but i don't but i don't
samsung example wasting resources I'm
trying to do one handed operation on
something like that well that's why I
don't think it's I don't think it's
possible I mean I don't think you can
rest at a 7-inch tablet on your palm in
order for your thumb to be able to
operate the tablet right hands are
clearly too small yeah but that's
nothing like that pipe that pilots that
drag on from the side lawn chair or
whatever that's one thing I'm kind of
confused about from Tony he said I can't
wait to get off the galaxy note 2
because I want to be able to use a phone
with one hand again and Jesus in the
same like the same conversation he's
talking about how he wants an eighth
inch phone sorry Tony I gotta call you
out but but I mean I use my note 2 with
one hand um I get all the time I get
comments all the time your hands are so
big I've got really short stubby fingers
but my hands are big um actually in the
video i made yesterday i had probably 20
to 30 comments is that the galaxy s4 if
my hands are big enough to make the note
to look like the galaxy s4 ah I just I
don't even know what to say to I can
touch all four corners of this xperia ZL
with a 5-inch display but it's all sad
nope that's also yeah but you know you
still need free cans like mine to be
able to Zulia all right I'm uh I think
this is like four episodes in a row
where we've talked about phone sighs
tablets we're not doing this again until
there's a new product to talk about can
I just will anybody objective hi say
that it'll be like my ways talking about
yeah I know there will ya exactly now
this week there'll be another know until
another one comes out I don't want to
talk about big big tablet phone small
tablets Bigfoot whatever let's go let's
move on to the next one first of all but
I do want it before we move on say thank
you very much neo again for ready n and
Dory I'm so tongue-in-cheek oh yeah no
good luck we don't know and you keep
picking with what works well for you man
um because that's all we can do our
friend alex song says hey guys have you
watched technobuffalo HTC One videos no
moving on I'm only kidding of course we
love jon rettinger
John and John is a good friend jon's
again John's a good guy John's a great
guy so he says I'm getting confused now
I had research in many sites to check
whether the ultrapixel camera is good or
bad with 4 megapixels it can't be that
but now we did talk about this earlier
on the on the show but I want to I
wanted to bring it up toward the end
we're going to close out with with this
one I hope you can give me some thoughts
in the pocket now weekly to share with
with others it's it's he says the
results that alex is seeing are looking
good but not great less noise and the
quality is not as bad as as Tony said I
guess in the last episode 2 which
another listener John Blake writes in
and asks do you think the HTC One is
just the beta version of HTC cameras and
as time progresses will they up the
megapixels to industry standards with
the same technology or will they stick
with your megapixels right so these are
awesome questions John Blake and Alex on
both of you thank you for writing in and
you know we talked about it a lot
earlier in the show I think we already
answered Alex your question primarily
you know I think camera quality is in
the eye of the beholder we all three of
us on the air today have very different
opinions on it everyone on the team has
very different opinions on it and that's
going to carry through to consumers as
well for some people it's going to be
more than enough for some people it's
going to be they'll be able to deal with
it and for some people that's going to
be absolutely unacceptable I think the
more interesting question is what worked
well for you and the question that that
closes us out a little better as John's
which is do we think HTC is going to
advance this ultra pixel technology I
know nothing about it i will answer
first very briefly yes I do I think
they're going to find a way to do this
and maintain their quote unquote
ultrapixel branding even if they have to
cheat like Nokia did with peer review
and I think that they're gonna advance
and yeah go ahead yeah I think the next
one will probably this is just a total
guess on my part but I think the next
one will probably have a sensor the size
of a 16mm mega pixel sensor I just I
can't talk so it'll have the sensor the
size of the 16 megapixel sensor that was
in the Titan if that sensor was any
larger than in a megapixel sensor they
could have just
the pixel size for that I don't know the
specifics on it but let's say you just
hate Titan jizzum yeah the Titan to I'm
sorry yeah so so take an 8 megapixel
sensor and double the size and then they
put 8 megapixels in there that's what I
think they'll probably do maybe that
would be nice be decent I think John put
it in the best way you know do you think
this is a beta of what HTC is gonna do
in the future yeah agreed that's the way
i see it i feel i feel that it's bold
it's a very cuddles move you know i just
wish i could swap that camera once they
come out with the HTC one to which sadly
that you know that's like what it's
upsetting me the most about HTC they had
the one last year and they were like oh
we're not gonna do so many phones now
and then they got the one then they
brought the one x+ and then they brought
the DNA three phones in a year three
flagship phones in a year well they were
better than it was better than 2011 when
they weren't flagship phones Oh dumping
phones left and right agreed agreed but
but you know I sensation late oh yeah I
spoke incredible 17 sorry good yeah I
think they should just focus on making
the one their phone you know the
marketing just one phone stop building
so many phones just give me one really
cool phone I think the one has the
potential I just wish I could swap the
camera eventually and you think that the
camera will do you think that they will
it improve on the camera significantly
in the next iteration right they have to
they have to yeah maybe we'll I am will
make an attachment for the HTC One maybe
I'll bring it up everything ring Amon as
their creative their director of
creative relations yeah well I am I love
your music Alicia Keys I am crazy about
your music and other things uh but I
hate the fact that you're selling
yourself off to these companies guys I
think we were gonna wrap it up to eight
we have closing thoughts first of all
readers thank you so much for writing in
and we're happy to be able to get your
letters on the air so thank you again
Taylor any closing thoughts before we
head out um I don't have the galaxy s4
so stop asking
well well said well said all right uh my
closing thoughts are regardless of which
phone you pick i think 2013 is a good
year when it comes to technology um
there are some phones that are good some
phones that are great but it's not like
in previous years where the difference
was very big right now the difference
between one phone and the other is
actually quite small so as I think that
whichever phone you pick will will be
whatever suits your needs best and the
great thing is you can always just
return them in your country in the
United States and just get another one
that's the cool thing about the United
States over not other countries just you
know play it safe try it out in our
cases again as Michael said beauty's in
the eye of the beholder and each of us
has a different opinion so so far my
money is on the s4 unless Michael can
obviously change that with a HTC one for
me as well well I will do what I can as
the as apparently phone Santa uh-huh
alright so also I have to ask am I still
fired because people are freaking out on
Twitter they're going crazy you think
