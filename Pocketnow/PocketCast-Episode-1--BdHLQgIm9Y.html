pocket now podcast we're calling this
the pocket cast we've never done a
podcast before even though we've gotten
a lot of requests for them over the
years we wanted to do a podcast in a
little bit of a different way than what
you see out there so the format this
will take is sort of a raw unedited
conversation between two smartphone
geeks and it will vary from week to week
probably in the form of one pocket now
editor to another pocket now editor this
week we're going to start out with Evan
Blass he's the managing editor here at a
pocket now and Evan say hi hey thanks i
re-read awesome and so yeah so we're
just going to cover about seven or eight
pieces of content that we posted within
the last seven days things that we
thought were particularly interesting
and we're just going to talk about it
and so you might hear mess ups and
bloopers and whatever we're going to
leave it all in there for the sake of
keeping this as raw as possible and this
will be this will continue on only if
you guys want it to continue on so
please leave comments please let us know
if you like this if you like it will
keep doing it if you hate it will stick
to video because we do a lot of video so
we are going to start it off now the
first-ever pocket cast so when we
started with them why don't know I heard
that you i got the dell venue this week
i just want to know what you thought of
it so far and they for the listeners who
don't know if you could you could tell
them a little bit about it sort of an
android-powered venue pro right that
doesn't have a keyboard obviously yeah
yeah exactly we saw this device a long
time ago I think engadget leak did they
had or I think it was actually the venue
pro that got leaked as the lightning and
did we ever actually see the venue as a
leak or was it just the the lightning
that you as the Thunder ah yeah so we
saw we saw it as a thunder and everyone
was like whoa look what Dells doing
they're coming forward with some awesome
android phones these things are never
going to come out and then they came out
um and yeah
that supposedly they have a in a
pipeline called the flash and if that's
a code name or I been at the detail dave
was going to be admist ADV is T so you
heard it here first folks right now
that's the only smartphone trademark
that dell has that not being used ha
interesting and so the flash looks like
the venue but it's got a front facing
camera it is white and it has a
different interface right interesting
specs at least at the time you know that
they live about nine months ago and at
this point they seem a little bit
antiquated imatra i think they would
have to bump up a little bit they want
us to be competitive at least or maybe
they're not looking at yeah a high-end
hands at this point except you know i
would i would agree with you with an 800
megahertz processor but hmm it has a
front facing camera which kind of
implies high-end so maybe this you know
this is just not going to ever ever come
around ah oddly the the buttons are in a
different arrangement I'm looking at the
flash so anyway yeah the venue really
cool phone because the dell venue pro i
think had the highest build quality of
any phone i've ever used and we rated it
really high in our review because of
that is also super fast it made windows
phone 7 look awesome and then the venue
is basically the same thing it's a
little bit thinner it has no slide out
keyboard and it's running android 2.2
with the dell stage you I that you kind
of get off of the dell streak and it's
it's a commanding device like the venue
pro i mean it's got this curved glass
display it's beautiful 4.1 inch AMOLED
display it's the biggest AMOLED that
they make you know Samsung's in there
with their four-point-oh inch Super
AMOLED so it's a striking phone but
anyone i give this to to hold in the
hand say wow this feels great but it's
heavy so that's um i think that's that's
my biggest complaint but it's it's
asked in Quadrant it doesn't really
measure up for some reason but in
day-to-day operation it feels fast but
overall I'm pretty impressed with it I
I'm looking at this device which is on
tmobile the venue and I'm also looking
at device like the Nexus S and I got to
say the nexus s just looks a whole lot
better it's a lot faster the fit and
finish just seems to be a little bit
better on the on the nexus s so kind of
a hard decision really lets you know
came of the processor is in the venue
yeah it's us 1 gigahertz Snapdragon okay
versus what the an 800 megahertz um
hummingbird and uh miss amisom I think
the Nexus S has the one gigahertz
hummingbird just like the the other
galaxy s devices okay yeah and you know
they both have 512 megabytes of RAM what
was really interesting was that I was
getting HSPA on the venue and I ran like
a million benchmarks over the last few
days and it's not HSPA speeds and then I
was trying to determine if there's a
difference between HSPA and HSPA+ which
there probably is but it's really weird
because the Nexus S is getting hsdpa on
tmobile then you turn on the the venue
it's getting HSPA but they're both
getting the same data speed so that
doesn't really matter you know the hspa+
is live at your network in your area I
mean I don't but I would have to assume
that it is because I live right outside
of philly and we tend to get you know
the sort of bumped up wireless speeds
are kind of first and I was just driving
through philly today I did a benchmark
and I wasn't getting hspa+ so I just I
guess it just doesn't support the the
plus which is technically called
enhanced HSPA so that that bit of
excitement kind of went away when I when
I discovered that it wasn't that fast
and we just learned out at CES that
t-mobile is actually going to be pushing
their network to I'm 42 megabits per
second this year theoretical speeds yeah
that's that's going to be great and then
they want to go all the way to six on
you
written what 72 megabits per second down
whether they're really going to go every
last drop a band like that of this thing
I guess I guess the the the downside is
the opportunity cost of investing in
hspa+ you know they're not going to be
able to spend those resources deploying
their LTE network they'll have it ready
by what like 2013 right but I think it's
probably a lot more expensive to to roll
out LTE which is a completely new
technology as opposed to just upgrading
their existing you know backbone which
is no they already have the hsdpa in
place I think it's just a matter of you
know making enhancements to it as
opposed to putting completely new or
we're out there right but I guess it'll
be a shame if you know they finally do
invest in their LTE they bring it out in
2013 and it's doing speeds that verizon
is achieving today while in 2013 verizon
will be you know doing speeds far far
greater than where they are today
lte-advanced the TV yeah is so it I
always wanted is that just a matter of
flipping a switch on verizon's in or
they have to climb up every tower and
put a new like you know cartridge in it
or something to turn on the events it
would be nice to get someone here on the
potty Catholic if you tell us about that
i think it's it's more than turning a
switch i think it has a lot to do with
software and optimizing the way that the
you know that the packets are passed
around but but beyond that it's way too
technical ways to actually get a game on
here but he understands it yeah give us
our new highly technical writer on
pocket now and perhaps he could shed
some light on this so that's definitely
something to consider because i think a
lot of people are kind of mystified by
all of these wireless standards that
come and go over the years so so let's
get into some of the content we posted
this week we're going to start off with
nvidia talking about their Tegra 2 3 d
chip and then their Tegra 3 quad-core
chip
coming out later in 2011 the stuffs
going to be launching Mobile World
Congress quad cores in a smartphone why
is the world ready for quad cores and
smartphone first of all um sure I mean
you know as long as the developers are
able to write software it take advantage
of it I don't see why not and let me
also say you know that they have to keep
the power consumption down you can't
have four cores point is or using as
much power as a tool for or you know the
batteries did a dream you know almost
twice as fast yeah they've got to be
building in some some really fantastic
power saving technology because I mean
we're going to see some I think crappy
battery life come dual-core time with
the upcoming devices and add double that
I just think it's going to be kind of
ridiculous in terms of battery drain
especially when I'm sure it has the
ability to turn off three cores and only
use one but if you're doing a lot of
intense gaming I can't imagine your
battery lasting very long yeah sort of
when I remember you know back in the day
before we had smartphones batteries they
used to last a couple days and every
store just accepted the fact that you
know your battery's gonna last a day at
that sometimes did speaking of which do
you remember the days when you had a
windows mobile phone and if you let the
battery discharge you lose all of your
data no I was you were doing that lucky
you yeah it was a that was before
Windows Mobile 5.1 of ridiculous but
yeah back in the day pda's would last
for days on end because they weren't
constantly sending and receiving
wireless data and you know using GPS so
that was pretty reasonable what what
kinds of kinds of applications do you
think can take advantage of quad core
configurations um just about anything
that's processor
to rendering web pages watching high
resolution or my definition video gaming
like you said doing like virtual
desktops BNC know if you want to control
your computer and and you know look at
your your desktop in real time on the
phone right like that you know you can
never have too much power but I suppose
I you know I it's it's crazy because I
pick up the Nexus S which as far as i
know is the fastest android phone out
there right now and everything is
instant you know bringing up a web page
of course take some time if it's graphic
heavy but going into email and SMS and
using the phone playing some games it is
so fast I just can't imagine I know this
is gonna sound weird in a year from now
but I can't imagine it being any faster
I donated random what do you mean when I
was like you know that editorial I wrote
ah I said you know I can't in
smartphones really get that much better
than they are now and yeah it was it was
sort of half funny that was advocate at
half true you know i mean it just
smartphones never done any better than
they are right now like we still be
totally happy I home you know we never
got one I ever better you know they just
kept coming out with with apps on a
mistake calverley it would be fine you
know I mean maybe other people don't
feel that way but but that's certainly
my feeling at this point well I guess
you mean to say that for what you use it
for you would be satisfied if you didn't
get more advanced capabilities on top of
what you guys today here's there's
almost nothing I could think of and I've
never used to be the case I you know
it's going to be faster it can have a
high resolution screen on cam give you
better and and now you know they're so
close yeah the camera could still be a
little bit battery how the flash could
be better but the you know i'm not sure
that
wherever is the really great cameras on
on the phones just because you know that
the lenses are so small you know you
have today it's a balance there were you
have to decide whether you want you know
whether you want portability or you want
good optus I gotta say though that the
camera on the iPhone 4 and a phoner to
more like the like the Galaxy S will
both the nexus s in particular it is
better than the sony point-and-shoot
camera that i paid 300 bucks for like
two years ago sure I mean they've agree
that just because of the the nature of
the lens needing to be large to let in a
lot of light you can never have a cell
phone camera be as good as a DSLR but
they they are darn good I mean some of
these i zoom either was really working
there well tell that to I think they're
I think a couple of weeks ago we posted
about a an android phone that had an
optical zoom it was really ugly but uh
it it was there was that repairs on it
could have been is that is that right or
out there it was it was a no-name
company and it looked like crap um this
is a case so grand and it's gonna be
children listen to this do better watch
my language I hope not this is this is
rated pg-13 just so so to kind of
conclude about the quad core thing I
think thinking about phones in today's
context and what we do with phones today
it's sort of impossible to say it's
impossible to say that yeah we need quad
cores but if you sort of think for a
minute and kind of extend out what
phones will be used for in the future
perhaps desktop-class applications made
into a touch friendly interface then it
sort of starts to make a little bit more
sense and I don't think by the end of
2011 when Tegra 3 is going to be around
we're going to have this answer and a
lot of people are going to think it's a
little bit ridiculous that we've quad
core cpus and phones but you know that's
just that's the way things are going and
maybe it'll all make sense a year or two
from now
I said that last year and it was I was
wrong anyway so let's move on let's see
here so on january 25th google voice
opened number porting to everyone which
was a feature that a lot of people were
waiting for like me my tell us about
your experience with that yes so I've
always had this okay call it a fancy if
you want a fantasy of being being able
to use any phone that I want and you
know either do you okay all right so you
know I review a fair amount of phones
for pocket now and if i'm reviewing a
phone on another carrier I've got it
forward my number and so with the idea
of porting my number to google voice i
could set up future phones on any
carrier so that i can receive calls and
send calls from my native number and
everything would be great so you know i
took the plunge on january 25th i ported
my number to google voice I probably
incurred a two-hundred-dollar ETF on
AT&amp;amp;T I was about probably forty percent
of the way through the contract but i
figure i'm going to be saving money
because i was paying probably one
hundred and eleven dollars or hundred
ten dollars for AT&amp;amp;T unlimited data 1500
minutes 1500 texts and now i am using a
tmobile prepaid card that's giving me
unlimited voice and data plus 2
gigabytes of data or unlimited voice and
text and a 2 gigabytes of data for 70
bucks so you know in about four months
i'll break even from this early
termination fee and so far I've been
happy you know there's a few caveats to
google voice but you know I've got
freedom to use any phone as let as long
as it has a google voice application and
i feel like a new man so now you're
making calls over the standard cellular
network
you're you're not making voice over IP
calls correct right and that's I think a
misconception of google voice what it
does is a little complicated you use
your phone and I'm talking about Android
iPhone us a little bit different you use
your phone as if you are just calling
anybody you'll get a little pop-up that
says you you know it says like now
routing your call with google voice and
google voice is going to call another
number which will use voice over IP and
somehow connect that with your actual
google voice number i'm not sure the
technicalities of it so it is working
over your minutes so it will go against
your minutes using google voice okay
okay now that google also has a product
like skype right where its voice over IP
the whole way yes so you can connect
your you can make google voice calls
over your google voice number through
gchat and that is totally voice over IP
okay but now you can't generally do that
at least in carriers over over your data
plan you could probably do it over Wi-Fi
I'm imagine or maybe not at all okay can
you do gchat at all from the phone um I
i don't i'm not sure i don't i don't
know about that we should we should look
at the answer no but a little annotation
on the video we will we will do that but
that would be a good question whether
you can use google chat on your phone to
place a call through google voice over
voice over IP over your data connection
i'm gonna i'm going to say probably not
but we'll look into that so my question
to you evan is why don't you put your
number on google voice well number one I
don't want to pay the termination fee
and number two I like having my google
voice number as a virtual number as
opposed to an actual number meaning i
like using I like you in that number two
people and then you know being able to
just sort of have it like a firewall you
know to be able to
manage things at at that level the same
thing is having a virtual email address
hmm so so there's a number of reasons
for doing so but I mean couldn't you use
your primary number as a like a sort of
firewall as you as you describe it I why
does it have to be a sort of random
number that google voice assigns you
another story I understand buzzing so
you want to have us you have a google
voice account right right and you're
using a random number that they assigned
to you more or less you picked the area
code so and and you like that because
you can give that to you know new people
that you need and you're not actually
giving them your real phone number so
you can rest assured that you could
block their call if you don't like them
earth or knowing or something right and
then you can also decide which pose that
room 2 i'm right now actually have a
landline but you know if I ever want one
again it would be nice to to be able to
control that you know from from from
that one panel but while also being able
to have the center numbers to give to
people you know people like my parents
do who don't necessarily understand
about that that long distance is free
now so have you know they like to have a
number for me too that's in a local area
code for that I see I think that you
would be able to achieve the same
benefits by putting your number to
google voice but you would I don't know
yet and let me say something else's is
how how you it's how you get a data
right now on your phone your you're just
doing a you still have to you still have
to pay pay a cell phone company for
service right yeah yeah so it doesn't
seem to me that that I mean you're
benefiting mind terribly all that moment
are you well well as i mentioned i'm
saving forty or fifty dollars a month so
i guess for most people they probably
are on a plan that is already optimized
but i was on this AT&amp;amp;T plan that was
just too expensive and i wasn't using
you know half the features are using
half the messages so from there I
decided to be bad you could you could've
just moved over to you anyway I got any
plan without doing another cool and save
money yeah but another consideration is
that you know I'm on this t-mobile
prepaid plan I can cancel it at any time
I'm really staring at that HTC
Thunderbolt on on Verizon's 4G network I
may want to switch to that Network full
time and if I do that there's not going
to be more number porting that I have to
go to you know it'll it'll immediately
using google voice i can immediately
basically use my phone number with
verizon's LTE phone if you will have you
will have to get a phone number through
verizon right yeah i mean when you sign
up for a new contract you'll have a
phone number and basically you're just
forwarding you set google voice to
forward to that new number and all the
elevator now through a wall yes two
gigabytes but uh you know i was on the
unlimited 18t plan before but I was
never did that bad I know and that was
the hardest part but but listen to this
I looked over my data usage in the last
two years and you know I'm a pretty
heavy smartphone user i tether all the
time I've never gone over nine hundred
megabytes of data have you have you
taken a look at your usage yeah all it
takes is one time where you're on
vacation and you want a slingbox like
phillies game that's right yeah slingbox
ille will do it that's for sure and said
if there's there's any 80 people
listening this you never heard that no i
don't think that you're technically
allowed to do that with your phone or
through your phone you're not supposed
to but I mean your pain you're paying
them for data you should be able to use
the data for whatever you want right
yeah anyhow so let's move on I'm going
to write a kind of lengthy editorial on
Google nuttin voice poor
doing why people would people don't want
to put their number over there sort of
the compromises I've had to face because
I think a lot of people could benefit
from doing this it's not for everyone
but definitely something to consider
let's it I might write a counterpoint to
your editorials and then it's not really
that very sad a challenge I wouldn't say
it's a challenge I'm just no sense and i
think our readers should get to death
both points of view and you know really
should necessarily Vinny tell them to go
right now do something that that the
average person that many benefits
problem especially if they're gonna have
to pay ya alright so my title will be
why you should port your number to
google voice yours will be why you
shouldn't port your number to google
voice and we will see who wins but i
want to read yours first if i want to do
it more like a counterpoint to your
article ah ok ok we'll do it we'll do it
i'm always up for a challenge alright so
let's move on we another thing we posted
on january 25th talking about the LG
optimus 3d potentially the first 3d
smart phone and you know certainly 3d
has had difficulty getting traction in
the TV space and now they're going to
bring it to a smartphone although
potentially without needing glasses mmm
I might argue with you science had
trouble getting traction I I look at
three years of same way that come HD
high definition was the beginning I mean
you know for four years I mean you know
it was it was a niche thing you know
people couldn't afford it they were
expensive and you know it seems then in
a matter of just a couple years you know
maybe two or three or is it you know
like that took off and and now
everyone's got an HD set and you know it
was the same I think it would be sort of
the same thing with blu-ray and same
thing with 3d it it really it has to be
a tipping point that's reached and
unless that happens you know people just
just rushed in technology so I went
necessarily count out
yet there's there's a lot of money
behind it there's a lot of big-name
manufacturers and I don't think it's
going anywhere I think once these these
corporations that put their minds and
then you know wallets and then vani caps
find something like this yeah they're
they're gonna going to make sure it gets
adopted well I I sort of agree i think
this the the glasses 3d TV thing is
going to die out in it's not going to
work and then you know a bunch of times
going to go by three years four years
we're gonna have glasses-free 3d TV
that's actually going to be good and
then people will be willing to pay for
it because they remember back ten years
ago to when they coughed up lots of
dough for the HD set and now they can
eat more easily justify another big
purchase because right now you know
these people that are sort of looking at
3d tvs probably got a HD TV just a few
years ago so they're already spent from
from that so so I think your next
question power you know what are the 3d
applications on a smartphone and I think
3d on the smartphone hinges a lot upon
the success of 3d in the in the living
room so i'm not sure than that that that
smartphones are ready for 3d you know
i'm just not sure that there's enough
content there to justify it it seems to
me gimmicky at this point interesting so
you think that 3d on the smartphone will
work when there's enough 3d content in
other words you think that 3d on the
smartphone will be for viewing movies
and TV shows that are in 3d right and
also playing games but and you know it's
another ticket right thing that the
screens have to be out there but I
making content but but people want to
say I understood making the content I'll
there enough screen and Africa great so
we'll see what you know right now it's
you know they're only even doing like
the first dedicated 3d gaming system
nintendo 3 yes and you know you have a
smattering of these sharp 3d handsets
but but right now it's really a sort of
a boutique thing and yeah I don't really
think that that the average person's did
it get much out out of buying this first
round of you know the LG optimus 3d
unless unless LG to push you know it's
none of their own you know content that
they that they pay for mission and
whatever yeah that's I think that's the
key i mean if LG has developed some
revolutionary 3d interface for your home
screens or some new email experience
that utilizes the XYZ axis which would
be confusing because you can't interact
with the z-axis huh it's only you know
it's really lame for life display
purposes right so we'll see i feel like
in kind of a sense LG is kind of rushing
this product out to be the first yeah
and hey would it be the first time that
they did that yeah they're they're big
on yeah I'm the first dual core
smartphone you know having a brightest
everyone wants to to be able to hang
their hat on something it's all about
the marketing material well we will were
sending Tony to Mobile World Congress so
hopefully he will provide some hands-on
time we don't have a 3d camera and
youtube doesn't do 3d yet so and
monitors can't do three so it'll be
inside by the way to our readers who
just read by lions yeah yeah aunt Tandy
naggy we call him Tony because that's
when he prefers to be called but he will
be in Barcelona in the next couple of
weeks for mobile world congress so we'll
see all this stuff will be talking a lot
about it should be interesting let us
move on something we posted on january
twenty sixth 2 million windows phone 7 s
shipped so far so Mike what my question
here is is this a sign of success or not
for windows phone 7 no I think
you know I obviously do a lot of reading
about the stock and see a lot of numbers
and everything is conflicting but I'd
say overall the feeling I'm getting is
that Windows Phone 7 is doing is doing
okay as expected to a little bit better
than expected yeah I agree with that the
more i think about Windows Phone 7 sort
of in the confines of the other
operating systems that are sort of
advancing the more I think about it as a
platform that isn't meant to compete
with Android these these updates are
coming out slow there's still a lot I
can't do on Windows Phone 7 I mean the
interface is gorgeous using it is a
pleasure but going from windows phone 7
to an android phone I just feel like my
handcuffs are coming off and I can you
know flap my wings in the breeze and do
a lot more yeah I feel it that way I
mean it's definitely a first generation
product and no I it's fun to play with
but I certainly would not spend my own
money on one of the insects until you
know they at least get this first round
of updates if not you know the second
round it supposedly come later in the
year as well stint mango yeah and
something else I'm kind of disappointed
about is the the developer support I
mean obviously the platform is locked
down enough to where the most we can do
right now with Chevron wp7 is change
ringtones change maybe some theme colors
but there's I mean I was hoping by now
we could you know completely change the
interface and remove rich restrictions
and have a third-party way of
multitasking through applications a
simple fast app switcher but so far that
doesn't seem to be the case and I know
the develop development communities
working on this but it's taking a while
yeah the security is tight on this
operating system really really tight you
know the trauma to Titus that run on
the mobile yep and yeah they they work
hard to make sure that that that that
there's you know a number of different
restrictions of that that are keeping um
hackers from from totally opening it up
and as we've learned it it may never be
totally open any of it is your you're
probably committing a crime if you um if
you use a lot of these services that he
didn't pay for yes I'm Xbox Live and you
know anywhere you're connecting to
Microsoft server the only way you're
supposed to have access to that is if
you paid for your handset and implicitly
for a license to use that copy of
windows phone 7 yep yep I on the on the
bright side to this HD two owners have
been able to finally run Windows Phone 7
on their device I don't know if you
remember Evan but you know when windows
phone 7 came out there was almost daily
rumors of whether the hd2 could run
windows phone 7 one day was yes one day
was no one day I was it just kept going
on mmm and finally through through sort
of unofficial unofficial means we can
run windows phone 7 on the hd2 and it
works very very well of course you can't
run you know xbox live and all the other
services connect it to the cloud but if
you want to push it a little bit better
though what he says compared to the
previous OS what are you really losing
other than market clips access and that
was even only there for four very late
in Windows mobiles you know life span I
mean that's I think that's the biggest
thing and I think a lot of people will
look at Windows Phone 7 with the stock
applications not being able to load
Twitter and Facebook and say this is
this is ridiculous ya know where there's
a will there's a way I'm sure that those
patient's will will become available
through side loading and you know
they'll they'll have an entire catalog
just like they do it with itunes apps
you know they they've cracked those and
you know you're in the piracy you can
get those off for free and silo them and
you know it's all it's all possible if
you want to do stuff like that so well
hopefully though there will be a
legitimate way to access the marketplace
with a I guess unsanctioned copy of
windows phone 7 and everyone will be
happy just one final note on this piece
of news about 2 million windows phone 7
shipped sort of an unfair comparison but
was doing some research windows phone 7
has been out for about six months now
and the iphone was around for about
eight months before it sold two million
units but of course that's kind of
unfair because not only are we three and
a half years later when smartphones are
becoming more ubiquitous but Windows
Phone 7 launched with nine or 10 devices
whereas there was only one iphone on one
carrier so it's hard to carve out a call
is that all that says is how well it
doesn't think anything all about about
Windows Phone 7 but it does say that the
iphone was an incredibly successful
product that's that's fair that's fair
cool all right so let's move on to
January 26th where we were talking about
the galaxy s2 dos how do you say to in
French da yeah but mobile Congress would
be in things I think those more
appropriate there so Mobile World
Congress the galaxy s2 the galaxy s was
a very very important series of devices
for samsung you know they were able to
strike up partnerships with every
carrier in the US and we saw it also in
other versions abroad and you know that
that relationship led them to get the
galaxy tab on every carrier and now
Samsung potentially rivals the the brand
notoriety that HTC had in you know 2009
yeah well I mean when you think about
the bigger picture Samsung has always
been a bigger company in general and HTC
and you know HTC sort of came and ate
their lunch for a little while but you
know Samsung has had the deep carrier
relationships in place for years long
before you know HTC mood was a glimmer
of anyone's eye so I so it was a
potentially find in other words what's a
samsung sort of a sleeping giant her for
a few years at least in the smartphone
space yeah that's that's true they had
the inroads they had the the bigger
brand the bigger company and they you
know they spent some good time on the
Galaxy S the galaxy s was a great device
you reviewed the fascinate right right
why don't you think of it mmm you called
me was no the swallow I liked it overall
it's a good device you know it's very
similar to I think a lot of the other
high-end Android and it sets out there
one thing I didn't like so much on it
and how much probably we keep it from
being a daily driver for me that didn't
have a dedicated camera shutter button
and versus day at the droid x which does
have that button and also I I like the
form Packer a little bit more of the X
even though the fascinate is is you know
slimmer and sleeker I sort of think
there's something cool about the box
eNOS of the x and the same thing with
the iphone 4 and from the rumors we hear
the galaxy s2 is also going to be a
little bit foxier at least at those you
know those those leaps suppose of the
renders or photos or whatever or turn
out to be you know accurate yeah that
seems to be the trend we had the sort of
nexus one looking devices and many many
many devices that look like that with a
rounded edges now we're starting to see
some squared-off edges like on the droid
x and the you know even the dell venue
and the very boxy shape of the the
iphone 4 just want to go back to
something you said about the dedicated
camera
ki I think one of the smartest things
Microsoft is requiring for windows phone
7 is the dedicated camera key and that
feature where you tap and hold the
camera key when the phone is off and
boom you're in the camera app I can't
stand using an on-screen camera button
it's it's so annoying and it must cost
these companies you know very small
amounts of money to include a shutter
button in the design of their device I
don't think it's definitely not a matter
of cost that no I think for so many
companies with Apple you know they they
want to they would have as few buttons
as possible I mean I'm sure that they
would love to get rid of the volume
buttons and the power button to it they
could but you know sometimes you just
have to have and did it's definitely
just a design decision I feel the same
thing with Samsung on the galaxies you
know they wanted this sort of wanted to
eight the iphone a little bit to end to
one outfit and and what an atom saying
his review he said that the thing was
the vibrant said it came closest to to
any phone into you know to being an
iphone you know killer or feet or
whatever you call it so yeah I agree
with you on that I definitely like to
have it and that's that's one of those
some cases where where where function
definitely takes precedence over over
for form is pretty you know I I i think
that the dedicated camera button is
going to go to the way of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack I think back a
few years ago OEMs had the same opinion
of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
especially HTC that why would they add a
stupid hole to the phone when they could
just do everything through the charging
and syncing port but you know I think in
a year from now or two years from now
it's going to become commonplace across
the board for there to be a dedicated
camera button and I'm sure you're going
to disagree with that no I do actually
and I think it's I think also to get her
the headphone jack part of the thinking
that was that that Bluetooth was taken
that there was no reason for it because
everyone was buying these bluetooth
headphones but that it turned out to to
grow into a certain point you know
everyone's phone as HTTP and Abbott you
really don't see a lot of YouTube
headphones out there still so the
battery life is so short they're not
really comfortable you know there's a
lot of reasons that that they haven't
taken off ya dumb it looked like they
might and you know at least as far as
kind of tents going though those were
getting really big too so yeah I can see
how how the thinking was you know what
why do we need this this extra port here
when you know we can we can sort of
gently push people towards going
Wireless right all right good point oh
yeah I remember back maybe four or five
years ago when bluetooth headsets worked
going to be the rage and I was thinking
about launching a bluetooth headset
website and there's others actually
there is actually a bluetooth headset
website out there Michael auroville
mobile burn one of my friends in the
community here launched a site it was
pretty cool he reviewed bluetooth
headsets news on bluetooth headset but i
think sort of with the with the trend of
people just using the phone as a phone
and without a bluetooth headset you kind
of stopped you know going with that site
but i mean i think you could get decent
SEO on a site like that yeah if you work
at it yeah I realized searches or enough
searches for for food stuff you know you
could you could keep it going around if
you could you know you could grow it
anything really big yeah very very niche
idea okay cool alright so we've got two
more stories to cover i think this this
this pocket cast is going to run a
little bit longer than we had
anticipated but that's okay hopefully
one thing I don't know before we want in
the galaxy s2 I want to mention to you
and I told you that that gave and I were
looking for the what
firmware and actually leaked out and
this was this is way before we knew that
the I 9200 was the galaxy s2 hop for a
long long time i 9100 harness was what
it was going to be so you know that's
what everyone's waiting for that
firmware and are looking for those
pictures on picasa and it just never hit
it because room was looking for the
wrong thing so once we realize this we
we took apart the firmware and it's
going to be sort of let downs of people
that that all of the other wallpapers
and there are wvga resolution ah so i
don't know if that this so just a
placeholder and since it was an early
version of the ROM and yeah I mean they
use a different screen on earlier
versions the phone but I think that
highly suggestive that we're not going
to be seeing we're not greasy and you
know an atrix style screen in there that
would be despicable if in 2011 Samsung's
flagship is not up to par with
motorola's flagship maybe 2011 will be
the year of Motorola although you could
argue that 2010 was but well that's
disappointing I am going to be a very
upset for the rest of the day those are
sorry hopefully it's a placeholder they
really need to bump the resolution you
know especially if they're going to do a
larger than four-point-oh inch screen
it's nice to have some extra pixels
there the good news that that camera
must definitely be a mega vessels
because I'm noticed there's some icons
in there for for the megapixel camera I
much rather have a 3 megapixel camera
that takes awesome pictures than a
twenty five megapixel camera that has
lots of noise when you put them on your
computer monitor I don't really know
where you weren't happy with yeah the
galaxy acid fascinating ah no the Nexus
S I think the Nexus S has a better
camera than the galaxy s devices
although I have to look back at that
I'll tell you what the real improvement
the Galaxy S owners are
looking for is in gps of course that's
enough aureus possibly I you know a
hardware problem a defect with you know
on the phone it sold millions we're
going to see a Toyota style recall soon
anybody that would be all right so let's
move on on january twenty seventh we
were talking about a blackberry leak or
several blackberry leaks the curve touch
among others mmm let's see so which
which devices are in question here the
Monaco touched the curve touch the
Monaco touch is the oh and then there is
the bold touch so I think we're talking
about three devices here they're quite a
few devices evident week in the past
couple weeks I think it's a total of
four a farm i asked i think i think we
look at for you and my uni five I know
we're looking at on that digit code of
it it's like a bowl but with the touch
screen Frank and then there was the
storm 3 that that were showing off the
torch to and then we have both the the
next generation curve which is the
Sedona or the Apollo I think it's the
Sedona though and then there's also the
test curve so that would be five hand
that's right it's a lot yep so yeah lots
going on with black very well but and
the specs we saw on some of these are
looking like they're they're finally
catching up but for many years
blackberry has been totally behind the
times and screen resolution processor
speeds storage space camera resolution
in you know you name it you name the
category
andrea has been you know the height of
times but it looks like they're they're
finally starting to catch up with this
latest generation yeah the the Monaco
touch has a 1.2 gigahertz processor any
of these have our dual core chips I'm
not sure but I mean their BlackBerry's
just they're just like you to sort of
get their their stuff together right now
down out there their overall in your
operating systems you know there's
probably to be moving everything over to
an ex based system away from you know
the current blackberry OS architecture
so I think there and I think they even
quoted as saying you know they're there
they're not ready to put these foos
dual-core processors and the phones
until you know they're there they're
able to you know meet a certain level of
power consumption or whatever for you
know there's it's still you know a lot
of these of primarily business machines
and you know business people on road
trips are they want you know they want
to get a certain amount of battery life
out of the phone yeah i think the the
key is the transition to q + X +
dual-core processors I think the devices
we're talking about right now are sort
of bridge devices that don't really
bring that much new stuff to the table
the specs are bumped a little bit but
we're probably going to see some
big-time smartphone blackberry magic you
know this time next year with probably a
rethought blackberry operating system
running on some pretty beefy hardware
absolutely very good and speaking of
next generation software let's talk
about honeycomb on yes the delicious
honey cone on january 27th we took a we
took some time to take a look at the
honeycomb emulator trying to get a sense
for how honeycomb will work on
smartphones because we are very very
curious and we know that honeycomb is
coming smartphones but we don't know how
and
you've seen hints of it we you know if
you resize the emulator strangely you
get an interface that looks like
gingerbread but a little bit different
which kind of was contrary to my
thinking which was that honeycomb for
smartphones is going to have a lot of
the UI of honeycomb for tablets but you
know februari second is just around the
corner we're going to probably be
learning a lot about honeycomb for
smartphones and I I think that resizing
the honeycomb emulator and seeing the
gingerbread interface was just kind of
Google as a way of saying that hey we're
working on it and this isn't complete or
even close to complete because it was
completely inoperable it wasn't a Kemp
getting a force close on the launcher
what do you what are your thoughts on a
honeycomb for the smartphone what do you
think it's gonna going to look like you
know I just I just don't know now get to
say I hope think Google is really reveal
enough you know I I think in general you
have to assume that that they're going
to keep the same basic styling cues so
so in one sense i think that you know
that that they could tell us a lot about
what it's going to be like but but on
the other hand you know it's a totally
different screen side different
applications different usage scenarios
so i'm not sure that that it could tell
us all that much that makes any sense
yeah i guess i've been on this android
kick lately um no no no no no no no i
was i was on an iphone kick i was then i
was on a windows phone 7 kick now i'm on
an android kick and you know i i've been
thinking a lot about this and the tablet
has a few paradigms i guess we can call
it that that is completely different
than how Android functions today for
example the button list design so all of
the buttons are virtual there on the
bottom of the screen you get the home
button in the back button I really think
that that's coming to the smartphone to
allow for buttonless hardware and then
this is like the worst idea
I'm so happy with that trend and how fun
this needs to be buttons for stuff you
know I used to love those windows mobile
phones they had about a trillion but no
man each of them like three you know
three different functions Thursday there
was like a button for calendar for
contacts for web for phone for I mean it
just was ridiculous yeah it was great
you know you had your multitasking
button and then you know you had the
bows that in the scroll wheel thumb
wheel sometimes they were like
multi-directional thumbnails like from
the CA oh yeah yeah back in the day oh
man um yeah I like buggies I like the
all the buttons on the trio you could
you know assign the S key to launch the
application or the are key so I'm a big
fan of buttons and I I don't like the
fact that that we're going to have
phones with no buttons at all because
you know sometimes your screen freezes
up you know the UI goes and you know
walkie and then you need to use a button
or something that's not there I guess I
I I tend to be on the opposite side of
the camp I think that when OMS don't
need to place buttons on phones anymore
we're going to see these very futuristic
looking screens and the screen will
actually be the phone but there will be
a razor thin bezel all the way around
the screen the the screen size will be
maximized and I think nothing can stop
them doing that right now you could you
know you could make an android phone
like I mean if it were technically
possible to get the speed at close to
the edge of the phone it would have been
done already I don't think it's the
buttons that are holding things up you
know you could you could put the buttons
on the bottom of the phone for instance
if you want it couples can poke that and
to still keep the other requirements of
the OS yeah you know buttons require a
minimum height to be pressable so I
agree with you that the technology
should already exists for bezels to be
really thin and I mean if you look at
the hd2 that has extremely thin bezels
the right and left side but then on the
top it's a little bit thick obviously
for the proximity sensor the speaker
grill and the bottom is like 150 percent
times bigger than the top bezel because
you need those buttons you need the logo
and I'm just saying with no buttons then
we get to bump the screen down that
would usually be taken up by those
hardware keys yeah yeah I super saying I
still know I like some buttons on the
side to the phone now for four different
things I'll a lot I'll compromise with
UW you can take all the buttons off the
face if you did you lose some other
sides um okay I'll go with that at our
okay just our next pay phone on the next
pocket out dream phone although don't
put a pressure or what was it on the
continuum the pressure squeeze sensor
and it just it didn't work I mean the
concept is great you pick up your phone
you squeeze it a little bit turns on but
it wasn't calibrated properly or just
didn't work type what is it the
continuum yeah the one with Ted the
Android with the ticker on the bottom
the fake to here where it's really just
one big LCD that they they blacked out
are in it yeah that's the first of one
so real quick just want to continue a
couple of thoughts on honeycomb for
smartphones so I think that that's the
first interface paradigm it's going to
come forward from the tablet is the
virtual buttons we're also going to
finally finally see a better way to
multitask an android android has been
multitasking since day one with a press
and hold of the home button which takes
too long it's a it's about a second or
two delay um I know that seems
ridiculous but compared I I think I'll
always be in a rush in and it's just
there's too much to do so so you know
with android 3.0 and honeycomb you press
this button that it's to the right of
the home button you get little pop-up
preview of the screens that are open and
you can access that from any program so
instead of a tap-in and a hold to see
the recent programs it's just a tap and
you get the previews very simple concept
although
think even better would be the upcoming
perhaps iOS 4.3 for iphone multitasking
feature where you use four fingers you
can swipe right to left I mean that is
awesome to be able to multitask that way
yes it's complicated though so many
gestures you have to remember and why
not well he I mean that's pretty simple
to remember well I just the beginning
though you look at do you have a macbook
or you know one of these these deep Mac
these Apple pads the touch pads there's
quite a few you know multi finger
gestures it's like a whole whole
dictionary of new yeah you're right I
agree and I think the same thing every
time I sit down in front of a Mac but
the truth is that when you're spending
that much on a new piece of technology
you're more than willing to learn 510
gestures and I think the same will be
this case for for a smartphone yeah
functionality is there you're going to
want to try to take you guys over
totally and one final thing that I think
are I hope is coming to Honeycomb for
smartphones is a new way to organize the
home screens because right now an
Android if you have a full a full home
screen and you want to switch the
location of two icons you have to like
delete one or slide it off the screen
and then move the other one in its place
and then add the other one you can't do
you can't move two things at once and
it's hard for you to manage you know
seven six five home screens in honeycomb
on tablets at least you get this awesome
looking zoomed out view of your home
screens with sort of like a tray that
shows you all your apps all your widgets
and I don't know how that you would do
that on a smaller screen but I really
hope that that it comes through on the
smartphone version of honeycomb yeah I
create home advantages is you know you
have all these different sized widgets
and you're trying to get everything to
work in both portrait and landscape it's
totally a mess and now you have some of
these
the OEM to just want you to let you do
landscape now you know you turn up your
home screen you turn your phone sideways
you know nothing rotates yeah although I
gotta say I use launcherpro which has
that feature you can do landscape home
screens I always turn it off because for
some reason this the device has a hard
time in rearranging the home screen at
the landscape and it takes like two
seconds and I guess because I'm young I
don't like to wait but um well that
exactly they can't get it right yeah
it's like dude this huge problem the
general problem with smartphone you know
that's what's it at any manufacturer but
you know also when you say rearranging
home screens one of one of the worst in
my opinion is windows phone instead of
that that if that's just an exercise in
frustration trying to get it so look how
you want and trying to you know switch
things around just nothing behaves
logically at least and you know for me I
don't know if you if you had a different
experience with it well in Windows Phone
7 uh you know I I set my home screen and
I didn't do anything else with it for
you know several weeks on end I I think
that because the home screen setup is so
simple I mean you get either to buy one
blocks or one by one blocks you don't
really have that need to move stuff
around whereas an Android I mean you you
can download new widgets and new
programs and you want to make your home
screens look awesome and you're always
moving stuff around so I agree it's a
little it's also challenging in Windows
Phone 7 but I didn't find myself with
that frustration because I wasn't moving
stuff around so often alright so that
concludes the first episode of the
pocket cast again it's a little bit
different in terms of the formatting
than other podcasts that are out there
for one we're doing this over YouTube of
course we're very open to the idea of
putting this on iTunes and the zune
marketplace and lots of other places but
we wanted to start off this way and kind
of give you a conversation about what
happened this week in smartphones
because we're fascinated by this stuff
and hopefully you are all too so again
leave us as much feedback as you can
thumbs up thumbs down and you like this
do you hate it
we have a thick skin we just want to
know if we should continue doing this so
thank you evan for being the first guess
of the pocket cast and we will see you
guys on the site next week have a good
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
