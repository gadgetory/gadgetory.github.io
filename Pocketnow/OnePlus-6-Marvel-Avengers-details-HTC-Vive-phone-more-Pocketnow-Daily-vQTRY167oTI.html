edition is coming sooner than later and
priced lower than expected HTC is
calling up for two events instead of one
for their new flagship it seems that
we're getting faster charging on this
year's iPhones after all I'm Jaime metal
yet it was so cool to meet some of you
yesterday at the oneplus event thank you
for saying hi I'm about to get on a
plane this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for the Samsung
Galaxy has a 9 RS 9 plus deals have
begun on Best Buy where you can get a
free pair of Ikon X or in the case also
a Samsung gear s three two products
which I highly recommend and then there
are also deals with lower price tags on
eBay you can learn more about everything
in the description far out HTC as a the
company already sent presentations for
the rent on the 23rd but we're kind of
wondering exactly what as a apparently
there are two invites or two pop up
locations that are happening in New York
City in San Francisco on the 23rd to see
the you whatever smartphone is going to
be not exactly sure why the separate
invitations but we'll keep you posted as
soon as we learn more now let's talk
about HTC again I don't think I've
covered more than one piece of news of
HTC lately now we hear from famous
tipster evan glass of a device codenamed
genesis and why are we covering more HTC
products think about it is apparently
this phone has a vibe logo in the back
and we've been covering some weird
interesting changes in the company like
for example a codename exodus with
cryptocurrency now a vive logo on a
smartphone this is really hot let's see
what the company is planning up now one
of the biggest complaints when it comes
to barring iPhones is how expensive it
is for you to get fast charging it's
funny the phone is capable but then what
you get in the box is not capable you
have to pay almost 75 bucks and
accessories in order to be able to bring
that up so we've got more trusted
sources claiming that we are getting an
18 watt adapter and apparently it will
cover all regions as it usually is where
you get different chargers depending on
where you buy it but yeah 18 watts
apparently it's going to be crazy fast
charging the iPhone is actually really
good at it I just hope it's not crazy
fast battery draining as it currently is
as well and finally the most interesting
news today have to do with the 1 plus 6
this is interesting as obviously we were
briefed early on the phone we were part
of the event and we did not see anything
that had to do with the Marvel Avengers
limited edition the company is very
famous for these launches but they
always happen after the launches in
typically in different countries
apparently it's pretty much already
happened in China the price tag is the
craziest part as you get the full spec
variant for 660 bucks sure it's a little
bit higher than if you would go for the
typical one but it's the oh my god like
the although pattern in the back and
just the whole design process it looks
great but in today's question let us
know number one what do you think about
the final design number two would you be
willing to pay that money because
usually limited edition I mean if you
look at Huawei for example that Porsche
design is like two thousand bucks
depending on where you buy it obviously
six hundred and sixty dollars is great
in my opinion but leave us a comment
down below we love to know your opinion
