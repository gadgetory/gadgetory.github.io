the beans on when to expect the next
iphone google continues with its
year-end deals this time including
applications on the list and YouTube has
begun to complain about t-mobile's
unlimited plans I'm hi Mary vera and
before I forget this script while
celebrating let's get through the news
this is parking out daily the official
news today continue with deals and still
coming from google as the company is
extending its google play deals not just
to include music and movies as we said
yesterday but now also to include
applications and books there are some
very interesting titles they're just
costing ten cents right now and then
when it comes to books the deals are
even crazier links to the description
for the full list of what you can get
other official news come from HTC as the
company has just pushed android sixth
auto marshmallow to its HTC One m9 which
we recently had an after the buzz video
by the way continues to be a really
decent phone not necessarily well priced
at this point but its successor is just
a few months away but if you already
have the HTC One a nine which was one of
the first devices to launch with
marshmallow then you can get Android
sixth auto dot one with a couple of bug
fixes as well I believe it or not one of
our favorite phones this year was the
alcatel one touch idol 3 particularly
because of what you were getting for
that price tag and it's designed and we
hear that its successor is going to
bring one of the new Qualcomm rebranded
processors apparently it'll be the
Snapdragon 650 to addition to three gigs
of RAM and the 16 gigs of storage now
this device was unveiled to us at mwc
2015 so we expect a successor to do the
same we'll keep you posted let's move
the spotlight over to t-mobile and
youtube or should I say the other way
around is it's YouTube the company that
is currently complaining about
t-mobile's practices in order to provide
you with a free streaming service you
know that service Bing on from t-mobile
which allows you to stream videos
without affecting your data plan and
even though YouTube is not part of that
list YouTube is complaining the t-mobile
is either throttling or down sampling
the quality of the videos
for reasons not totally understood it
could just be that there's a bug on t
mobile services it could be so many
other things but hey if a t-mobile is
doing that for us to pay a little less
money it's not necessarily that bad but
we do understand where things are going
here and finally the very hot news today
come directly from china mobile as the
company has just built the beans on its
roadmap and within the list there you go
is the 4-inch iphone being mentioned and
according to the list that will be
available in April which is extremely
interesting as we do know the rumors are
that the event is going to happen in
March and yeah it seems that this
product will happen but it does lead me
to the question of the day would you
mind that that iphone mini becomes an
exclusive to emerging markets or an
exclusive to China or what you want that
phone for yourself in my case I don't
really mind i would rather the larger
iphone i've just gotten so used to the
larger phones lately that i don't see
myself going back but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
earlier before this video was filmed be
sure you follow us on Pocket out comment
subscribe changing channel as well it
followed me on twitter hi managers Corey
Vetter on Instagram it I'm gonna leave
it up please give this video thumbs up

that any better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow believe
it or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
