the larger version of the two just
arrived I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our iphone
six-plus unboxing so this is it this is
the iPhone 6 plus the larger brother to
the iPhone 6 but it's pretty much what
people have been begging Apple for for
years now because this this thing is
tiny this is the iPhone 5 and if you see
in my hands it looks just like a toy
it's so small so everyone has been
asking Apple for a larger iPhone and as
you can tell from the size of this box
that's exactly what we got we got two
versions this year the iPhone 6 which is
4.7 and this one which is the iPhone 6
plus at 5.5 inches so let's get in the
box and see just how big this new iPhone
is do have a little cutting tool right
here that I like to carry on my keychain
let's get in I do know one thing about
this box already I have not opened this
clearly all the seals are still closed
but I do know that there's no branding
or no no image on the box this year it's
just a little embossed or an outline of
an iPhone but no iPhone image which is
new but as you can see just going around
the box it's exactly what we can expect
from Apple very plain very toned down
packaging and of course it's wrapped in
plastic so let's get that cut open
really quickly see what's inside the box
that everyone can already guess what's
in the box of course this is the 64
gigabyte version so there are three this
year you have 16 64 gigabytes and you
have 128 which is very nice I almost
opted for that but I stayed with 64
gigabytes because I have a 32 gigabyte
iPhone 5 right now and I had about 50%
storage left the other day when
upgrading to iOS 8 so let's get the
phone out and immediately you can see it
is very very very thin but I will sit
this aside because that's what we do to
see what's underneath so of course you
have your little pool tab
reveals this little pamphlet with all
your stuff inside your reading materials
that I can't manage to get open your
leaflets your stickers and all of that
but unfortunately this iPhone 5 or
iPhone 6 plus from Verizon does not come
with a sim removal tool
thank you for Ryan I guess I don't
really want you to switch out your sim
but whatever it comes with a Simonet I'm
okay with that your AC adapter as usual
and I'm actually interested to see what
the amperage is on this because it does
have a much larger battery it is still
just one amp I don't know if you can see
that it's still one amp but this phone
does have a much larger battery it's
almost 3000 milliamp hours of course we
also have your standard lightning cable
right here nothing fancy there and your
ear pods unfortunately these are not the
bone conducting ear pods we heard about
just a few days ago these are just your
standard ear pods for their nice casing
they work in a jam I don't like them but
whatever and that's it there's nothing
else underneath that so this is the
iPhone 6 plus and as you can see it's
actually a nice size for my hands which
is very nice for me I've been cramped on
the iPhone 4 so for such a long time but
let's get the plastic off just and I
don't ever get these noisy plastics
anymore I guess they stopped doing that
didn't they don't noisy plastics they're
all nice and clean they pull off silent
but I'm not your Michael Fisher I don't
I don't zoom in for that as you can see
on the left side here you have your
volume rocker as usual but these are
elongated buttons so they're they're
very thin and elongated they're they
feel really nice and then you have your
mute switch there for toggling on mute
and your your vibrate and your power
button has been moved to the right edge
so it's no longer on the top of this
because it's too big too hard to reach
they moved it to the right edge which
you've seen a lot of other manufacturers
do as phones got larger there is your
SIM tray just below the power button and
of course along the bottom you have your
speaker your lightning and three point
five millimeters around the edges that's
all you get so nothing major there but
around back there's uh there are a few
things to note
you have your separated plastic line so
you're probably I think they're probably
carbonate for your antenna separation
and then you have your camera module
which for the first time ever is raised
so it's not flush with the back of the
phone some people aren't very happy
about that I'm inside this time you
still get one gigabyte of RAM so no
improvement there I've already told you
16 64 and 128 gigabytes for storage you
have the new Apple a8 with a new m8 Co
processor and this time you get a 5.5
inch 1080p iPhone display or Retina
display I guess you should call it but
while this boots up we're gonna do some
really quick size comparisons this is
the iPhone 5 look at that that's a sight
to see but I also have some other large
phones to compare this is the Oppo find
7 a and you can see these are very
similar in size the iPhones a little bit
taller a little bit skinnier but yeah
they're very close in size and this is
the ascend mate 7 so this is a 6 inch
display with very very little bezel
around the screen but let's jump through
the set up own give you a close-up of
the display so here we have it with it
all powered on and jump through all the
settings
I didn't download any wraps or anything
but you can see just how clear it is I
don't know if you can see I don't I
don't know if the camera does it justice
but the ad looks it looks very nice same
kind of saturation and pop you get out
of a normal iPhone display or the ones
we've been used to over the years yeah
it looks really good it looks really
nice and it's very nice to finally have
an iPhone and a size that fits my needs
so stay tuned for the full iPhone
six-plus review as well as some
comparisons and other content right here
on the PocketNow channel until next time
I'm Taylor Martin and thanks for
