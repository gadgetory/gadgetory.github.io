ultrapixel polycarbonate or aluminum if
these are the decisions running through
your mind
let us help I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Nokia Lumia 1020
vs. HTC One at first blush there's
almost nothing similar about these
smartphones they're made of different
materials they're casing designs are
totally disparate and their software
platforms have almost nothing in common
aesthetically but there are two
commonalities here they're both among
the best their respective platforms can
offer and they're both being sold on the
merits of their cameras let's jump into
our comparison and on the way you should
follow PocketNow on social media and
subscribe here on youtube so you don't
miss future ones
thanks let's talk about casing build
first since this is the most obvious
difference between the phones the HTC
one's zero gap construction is the more
eye-catching with its machined aluminum
body and polycarbonate accents and it
feels quite well-constructed in the hand
its build quality making it seem more
substantial than its 143 grams would
suggest though it's a robust 9.3
millimeters thick at its middle the
shell tapers down to about 4 millimeters
on the sides giving the phone a very
sleek in-hand feel the Lumia 1020 gives
off a reassuring well-constructed vibe
as well but that's about the only
physical similarity these phones enjoy
the 1020 is slightly squatter but in
every other dimension it's larger
peaking in thickness at ten point four
millimeters and weighing in at a hundred
and fifty eight grams it's also made
entirely of matte polycarbonate save for
the aluminum camera disk inside keys and
the Gorilla Glass 3 display facing
generation newer than the ones display
protection it's hard to overstate how
different these devices feel in the hand
the one continues to impress with its
elegant if slippery design and its
aluminum build while susceptible to
scratching on the chamfered edges still
turns heads everywhere we go the Lumia
1020
turns heads also but for a different
reason the big PureView bulge around
back is impossible not to notice and it
definitely makes holding the 1020 a
unique experience
we're glad the Lumias polycarbonate
seems able to bear up to some abuse
because we can definitely see ourselves
dropping it due to the awkward placement
of the camera finally both of these
phones are Weeble wobbles when placed on
a table so don't expect to use either of
them no handed down in the engine room
the disparity continues but there are
some commonalities here too as an
Android flagship the HTC One is the more
modern of the two internally powered by
a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 at
1.7 gigahertz and backed up by two gigs
of RAM and 32 gigs of on-board storage
the Lumia 1020 makes do with a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 at 1.5 gigahertz
but it matches the two gigs of RAM and
32 gigs of storage in each case the
onboard memory is non expandable also
not expandable on each phone the battery
for what it's worth the HTC one's power
pack is the larger of the two at 2,300
milliamp hours versus the Lumias 2,000
milliamp hours and we'll have more in
depth thoughts on the Lumias battery
endurance in our full review even the
window into the heart of each phone is
different the HTC One features a 5-inch
SL cd3 display kicking out a resolution
of 1080p while the Lumia makes do with a
4.5 inch WXGA screen that uses AMOLED
technology while that's about as
different as you can get on a pair of
modern flagships the saturation and
color temperature concerns people often
cite about AMOLED can be adjusted with
the Lumias new software customizations
and the grayish black sand washed out
colors
people sometimes attribute to LCD
screens really aren't in evidence at all
on the one daylight visibility is just
slightly better on the HTC device as
different as these screens are
technologically they're quite comparable
in real-world use the rest of the specs
between these phones match up quite
nicely with a few exceptions like the
Lumia 1020 s onboard barometer and the
HTC one's IR port and 802
111 AC support features shared by the
galaxy s4 we compared the new Nokia to
yesterday speaking of the galaxy s4
comparison that video gave us a chance
to highlight some of the broad
differences between the Windows Phone
and Android platforms and much of it
holds true with our HTC one here but the
one is running a very different
third-party UI atop Android and it's
called Sense 5 this is a much flatter
more minimalistic and frankly more
responsive skin than Samsung's TouchWiz
so it's actually a much closer analog to
Windows Phone 8 running on the Lumia
1020 that's especially true if you agree
with those who feel that HTC's blinkfeed
social app is derivative of the Windows
Phone design aesthetic but similar is
not identical and the bottom line here
is that the software on these phones is
still fundamentally and hugely different
see our full reviews of both Windows
Phone 8 and the HTC One for our in-depth
thoughts on these two platforms also
fundamentally different the camera
experience on each device but there are
still some surprises here while the
Nokia is absurdly huge 41 megapixel
camera is over ten times the resolution
of HTC's 4 megapixel shooter the contest
isn't the slam-dunk you might expect
remember the ones camera packs optical
image stabilization alongside a sensor
with very large pixels meaning it can
capture pretty excellent low-light
photos now the 1020 certainly can as
well thanks to its manually customizable
shutter speed exposure almost every
other setting you can think of as well
as its own optical image stabilization
but the added light that the one
automatically imparts to a scene is
sometimes quite helpful other times
though it can be a hindrance and that's
where the 1020 shines many photos taken
with the Lumia show richer more natural
color saturation than the ones washed
out results in the Lumia with its thirty
four megapixel Raw and five megapixel
oversampled shooting modes also excels
at picking out fine detail that's
especially true with text photographed
from a distance with the 1020 providing
much sharper results even in low-light
results which can be seen right on the
phone before
the photo for later on through simple
cropping in terms of 1080p video the
1020 is the clear winner while the one
might deliver louder audio and a
slightly more stable picture it also has
a tough time keeping focus and it
exhibits much wilder swings in exposure
when shifting between light and dark
zones by contrast the 1020 delivers a
sharp saturated and much crisper image
most of the time here's a few seconds of
sample footage from each with audio
the front facing cameras deserve one
sentence and here it is
they're both wide-angle which is great
and they offer you a choice of a
horrible purple tint or a sickly green
one which isn't great the front facing
cameras folks let's move on time to
touch on the view finders where the one
uses a fairly typical smartphone
interface for snapping photos with
filters and shooting modes and such
the Lumia pulls out all the stops with
available adjustments for almost every
setting you can imagine including manual
focus the Nokia pro camera app takes
significantly longer to launch as a
result of all that added power but it is
worth it
the Lumia also packs the nokia smart
camera app for some fun editing options
like erasing unwanted objects instilling
motion blur and so on but remember these
options are matched and even exceeded in
some respects by HTC Zoe on the 1 and
the 1 also sports one of the most
enjoyable gallery experiences we've ever
come across so while the 1020 may enjoy
the upper hand in terms of raw
photographic performance the 1 is no
slouch when it comes to a solid camera
experience overall we're using the Lumia
and the one on separate networks so
you'll have to take some of our test
notes with a grain of salt that aside we
found the one to be a bit better at
suppressing background noise in boys
calls which shouldn't be a surprise
considering its excellent record in the
phone call arena that holds true for
speakerphone performance as well those
boom sound forward-firing speakers
aren't necessarily louder than the Lumia
1020 s bottom mounted port but they're
definitely clearer and more dynamic the
Lumia brings a little bit more heat in
the earbud Department its dolby
headphone support a bit more
customizable than HTC's Beats Audio
but overall the one is in no danger of
losing its audio quality crown to the
Lumia buying either one of these devices
will mean that you're getting some of
the very best of what a platform has to
offer while there are major differences
in aesthetics and internals the biggest
gulf here is obviously in the camera now
the one excels at delivering an
excellent casual
experience with bright low-light shots
and lots of fun touches like the Zoe
suite many of which are so much fun that
they might actually change the way you
share pictures from your smartphone but
it's resolution is pretty low and it
doesn't always produce the sharpest
results the Lumia 1020 packs in a lot of
its own fun in the form of the Nokia
smart cam but its primary camera lends
itself more to the aspiring professional
photographer or at least a person
willing to fiddle a little with settings
if you're one of those people the Lumia
1020 can produce the best photos you'll
ever see from a smartphone and even if
you're not one of those people the 1020
will probably still outclass the ones
pictures the only question is whether
you're willing to spend the extra
benjamín on the Lumia over the one on
an AT&amp;amp;T contract and of course whether
you're willing to consider a Windows
Phone as your daily driver folks if
you'd like to see the Nokia Lumia 1020
face off against the galaxy s4 the Lumia
920 or if you just want to see it come
out of its box all those videos are
already up and you can find them on our
