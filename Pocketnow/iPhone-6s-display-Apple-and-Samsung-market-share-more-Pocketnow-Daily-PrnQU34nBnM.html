show major changes Evelyn google shows
some summer deals if we could call them
that way it seems that Samsung and
apples dominance over the smartphone
market continues I'm hi mehbeh Nevada
and this studio is about to change again
next week so prepare your echo loving
ears for some trial and error this is
 out daily one of the most
anticipated deals of the year has ended
up disappointing people apples back to
school deals are now official silently
in the company's rebate area instead of
in the past where it had a front page
area for itself and what you're getting
is a pair of beats solo 2 or a discount
for a beats solo2 wireless bear
headphones which is okay if you buy a
Mac the Mac Mini is not included on this
list and if you're buying an iphone or
ipad you get nothing something's wrong
with Cupertino they're making so much
money and it seems that they're pulling
things back and then other deals come
from google as the company has a games
on sale for as little as ten cents
apiece in the case of sub games and
other games will just be discounted to
summer for five dollars six dollars
depending on the quality of the game
sadly so far it seems that only the goat
simulator is costing those ten cents and
addition to other ones that are not
really hot but hey deals are there
hopefully they get better soon I'm even
though most of the speculation with the
iphone 6s was clear we were getting the
same design with a couple of changes and
internals some rumors claim that we were
getting a selfie flash and better touch
ID and as it turns out we get the first
leaks of the display and we are getting
pretty much the same display so for
those of you that were waiting for
better stuff it seems that Apple is
going to tone down things a bit and wait
for the iphone 7 and most of the rumors
lately had to do with the galaxy note 5
and it's self ejecting s-pen or push to
eject sailfin or whatever mechanism
they're planning to bring given the case
leaks that we've seen but that some
trusted sources claim that know that you
will still have to remove the s-pen
manually because it seems that the
hardware's night there yet apparently it
has to do with the fact that this will
keep the phone then if that's even
important for no
line up device but anyways it seems that
things might not happen as we expect or
it could just be that there are a couple
of variants we'll see and finally for
the very hot news of the day lots of
information has just come in regarding
smartphone market share and well we got
details from Samsung details from Apple
Samsung currently owns the market with
twenty one percent and then Apple trails
back with fourteen percent which is
understandable but if you look at the
same figures last year for the same
quarter samsung had four percent more
market share and guess where that four
percent market share has gone it has
gone to Apple Apple has grown
dramatically with the iphone 6 iphone
success and the other OEM that has grown
a lot as Huawei it has grown forty-eight
percent even though those numbers still
have a tad eight percent of market share
which is not significant but it does
lead me to the question of the day let's
update your comments and learn which is
your favorite smartphone OEM which
company do you trust the most when it
comes to smartphones I'm not even going
to say it because I have a couple of
brands that I like Motorola Apple to be
just some but leave us a comment down
below which are your favorites and
