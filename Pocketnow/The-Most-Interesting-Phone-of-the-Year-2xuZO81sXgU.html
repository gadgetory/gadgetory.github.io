a few analogies that come to mind but
the one I like the most is of a
Lamborghini which as a matter of fact is
also the brand of its special edition
variant si as beautiful and as fast as a
Lambo is for some users owning a car
like this is just ragging rights like
for example I wouldn't dare driving that
car on certain roads and we see
potential hindered by basics like speed
limits still let's be honest if you had
the cash to buy one I would doubt you
would pass on the opportunity of owning
such a beautiful piece of machinery so
this is the Oppo find X for me I know
it's taken us a while to do this review
but we wanted to make sure that we had a
unit that we could test in its full
glory and it's finally here I'm hanging
metal even with pocket now and let me
tell you why I love and why I also don't
love this phone let me start by saying
one of the most important reasons why
this phone matters I have tested nearly
every single smartphone this year and
the Oppo find X continues to be one of
the coolest products I have ever used
not just phone products this device is
proof that the fine line wasn't really
dead but instead just marinating a way
to leapfrog its competition one more
time it starts with the hardware I mean
look at this phone it is gorgeous the
curved glass finish match with the
aluminium trim and the accents at the
top and the bottom make this phone feel
like no other the green finish on the
variant we received the only serves to
accentuate it particularly if you look
at the borders but wait there's more
those of you complaining about notches
will be happy to see none here we've got
a large six point four two inch AMOLED
screen that's stunning to view as much
as it is to use to make that possible
ovo came up with the most genius
solution which is hiding all the cameras
in a mechanism that reveals itself only
when you need it
this means there is no fingerprint
scanner and there is a less secure face
to unlock solution compared to face ID
but comparable in speeds I mean you
would think that the mechanism would
take longer than face ID but it actually
doesn't but wait there's more tucked
inside we have the best specifications
for 2018 with a bokram snapdragon 8045 a
gigabytes of ram 128 or 256 gigs of
non-expandable storage a 37 30 milliamp
hour battery and Buch rapid charging
which is epic and now works through USB
see right about now I know that you're
asking yourself why did I choose that
Lambo analogy just like you can't drive
a Lambo on every road there are things
that this phone can't do that pretty
much every other flagship does and which
I would consider essential like for
example the lack of dual firing speakers
even if the single firing one is okay
the lack of any sort of water resistance
which I was also expecting given the
camera mechanism and also be ready for
lint in that mechanism as it will pick
that up and last but not least I do
highly recommend you get a case as I
have never seen a phone fall off a table
faster than this one and then there is
the software story which I know will be
probably the least favorite feature of
most of you this is color OS now
graduated to version 5.1 on top of
Android 8.1 Oreo if you're trying to
find any similarities with Android let
me just say that it's more similar to
iOS actually most like an OGG rafi and
the style of the menus is designed to
feel more like an iPhone things I
praised are the optional navigation
gestures which allow you to take
advantage of the display to its fullest
I also like gobos theme store which
allows you to make the user interface
adapt to your taste and yes you can
install Nova Launcher in this
international variant but it is just as
much a nightmare to keep it working that
sometimes it just defeats the purpose to
actually want to use it overall the only
advantage that I see in this user
interface is the fact that for those of
you that are using iPhones and want to
switch to Android this is probably the
one with the least amount of learning
curve now I've been using the Oppo find
X on and off between Berlin New York
City and on dudas for the past month and
change
my experience so far is that it has
better call quality than I expected I
mean the earpiece is tucked inside the
mechanism and even so it sounds great
and even with its lack of stock Android
this phone is fast blazing fast the only
thing is that color OS has so many
animations that it would seem to be slow
but whenever you try to launch
applications everything works just great
and I feel the same when playing games
there is zero lag in the experience of
using this product that just has slow
animations and another thing that's
really surprising is that you would
assume that because of its proprietary
software the battery life wouldn't be
good but it's totally the opposite this
phone really ends the day without a
problem and this is even after needing a
sliding mechanism to unlock the phone
every single time I find it to be
fascinating and I also love boot rapid
charging it is seriously quick now the
camera is a very interesting combination
to review historically I've been very
impressed with Oppo phones when it comes
to color reproduction of their photos
sadly not so much their dynamic range in
the case of the find X all this has been
addressed to a certain degree
spec wise the sliding mechanism reveals
a 16 megapixel primary def 2 aperture
and one point to 2 microns and oh is
with a secondary 20 megapixel camera at
f/2 aperture and standard microns
resulting photos are actually pleasing
to the eye with warm colors good detail
and again great results in HDR and both
day and night I do have to say that this
phone feels comparable to every flagship
in the market and with portrait mode
showing some decent results you will
notice some noise when it comes to a
little light and obviously moving
subjects for a little bit of a struggle
but again it's the territory that you
also deal with other flagships the same
goes for the selfie game thanks to this
25 megapixel shooter at f/2 aperture
even if I'm not really a fan of the
selfie portraits the problem really is
when we get to things like video where
yes 1080p video is good with awesome
dynamic range good stabilization and the
camera adapts very well to close-ups the
problem is when you switch to 4k as
there is no stabilization whatsoever and
essentials like 4k at 60 are not here
and then the same can be said about
selfie video where I do like the crop
but there is no stabilization here
either so this is definitely not your
vlogging phone to conclude let me just
save this just like a Lamborghini isn't
the perfect car for all types of roads
this isn't the perfect phone for all
types of scenarios if you were expecting
a flagship that does everything this one
is not
but then again here's the thing just
like the shortcomings of a Lambo or all
to allow it to specialize in one
particular thing which is speed I would
feel the same about the Oppo find X the
shortcomings are to allow it's designed
to be possible and I'm honestly glad
that products like this exist as
smartphones were definitely starting to
get boring I know people will debate
things like the $1,000 price tag for a
phone in 2018 because yes I know
competing devices have essentials like
water assistance dual firing speakers
wireless charging etc all things that
the Oppo find X does not have still once
again with this phone lacks it
compensates in so many levels with the
genius of its design so much so that
it's really hard for me to not give it
the title of the coolest phone that I've
ever used is it worth the money I would
say that it is just like in the case of
a Lambo the Oppo find X deserves not to
be compared it might not be perfect but
it definitely gives me a solid glimpse
into the future and I really really like
where things are going
