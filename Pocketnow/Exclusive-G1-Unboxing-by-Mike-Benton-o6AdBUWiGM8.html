calm and today we're gonna unwrap this
g1 here and show you how it looks
compared to some other devices and
objects as well as go through some of
the things that you will find
interesting so let's get started here's
the Box we're not gonna go into too much
because there's not a lot on the box
just key features and you can't look at
that so alright let's open this up we
got to cut that and open that up right
there and let's see what we got inside
look at that nicely centered great
presentation they've done a little bit
different here I had things over here on
the side so because we like to tease
people we're just not gonna open up the
phone unit so we got the gettin started
manual some terminal so you can be
honest and some too little hot spot
terms and conditions you can get this if
you lose this we have it on our website
at all shadow comm and the wiki so I
don't tell you some basic things to how
to use the device that's everything
there is this little tips and tricks
alright so we got everything in here oh
we have a SIM card I don't need that
okay we'll just use my sim card but
that's cool it's always nice to have an
extra SIM card just forget that thing
worked out all right oh this thing looks
pretty now this is according to the box
it is Google Brown and it really doesn't
look that Brown for example here's the
shadow copper just compare the colors
there should be able to see it's
actually lighter it's very subtle Brown
it looks more like a dark gray so it's
not that ugly
nice little screen protector on there to
start with it's got a real nice smooth
feel to the back I like that they have
the extra layer over the lens for the
camera so we don't get that scratched up
like on prior devices and we have a
couple buttons on the side it's like a
plus and minus probably the volume you
micro SDHC slot and the charging panel
there of course that's where our
headphones are going to go into the
camera button and then menu button call
home
the back button and the end call button
as well as the trackball let's see how
this thing slides open that's actually a
pretty smooth slide so we'll compare it
to the shadow slide which over time gets
kind of loose but it's not as stiff
feeling but this has a real nice sliding
motion to it if I were you I tried not
to stick anything in there while sliding
you don't want to break it buttons have
a nice tactile feel we'll see how that
comes out over time see if those are
nice now right off the bat I am noticing
that there isn't much of a
differentiation between the different
buttons on here
however on the F and the J key there's a
little raised nib there that so you
could find the center if you can't see
that see what else we got going on here
I don't know if I'm supposed to open
that well that's a battery cover okay so
let's see what else we got in the box
got a piece of foam anybody likes to
play with foam right there's foam that
USB cable charging cable more headphones
I love these things these are great push
button on there let's open those up so I
know people are always interested about
the headphones should they buy more
headphones or not extra little foam pads
for your earphones got a sliding volume
button right here push end call button
and it looks like these headphones are
typical where one is longer than the
other so this thing so the microphone
will actually close through your mouth
when you're speaking so some people like
that some people don't replace that off
to the side and a battery and a carrying
case now I don't know what to think
about this carrying case now that I'm
looking at it
it looks kind of cheap in fact it's not
even the there's no belt loops on this I
guess this is let me just throw that in
my backpack right there or my bag kind
of carrying case keep it from getting
scratched up however does smell like
leather so that might actually have a
leather or a pleather around the edge
and some sort of neoprene foam right
there so I guess it will do its job of
protecting the phone and that's
everything on there I'll get rid of that
that clear all this off the table and we
will get a look at the G phone more
closely all right we have the G one
right there shadow blackberry pearl 8130
first-generation iPod Touch and these
are size comparisons so you could see in
hand what these how big these devices
are it's a little bit bigger than the
shadow a little bit taller and it is a
little bit wider now the thickness it
appears to be a little bit thicker
feeling it in hand it does feel a little
bit thicker however it doesn't feel like
it's cheap basically it's got a nice
heft to it nice little bit of weight
compared to the Pearl it's about the
same as the shadow and size so there's
not much of a difference there basically
yeah so it's a little bit bigger than
that here's the iPod Touch it's a little
bit thinner than the iPod touch but it
is a little bit taller and definitely
thicker than the iPod touch so we had
those devices in case you don't have any
of those devices is what it looks like
next to a soda bottle okay now let's see
if so that is the G one good look at the
hardware and what comes inside the box
the next video we'll take a look under
the hood and show you some of the
applications and what it has to offer
has a real good feel to it if you're
worried about how it felt sore the size
of it it's really not that bad
actually a decent size phone I'm really
liking the way it feels
so until next time I'm Mike Benton for
all shadow comm
