nitty-gritty features of the Galaxy s5
well look no further
I'm Tanner Martin this is PocketNow and
here are three fun things to do with
your Galaxy s5 between the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy
s5 the CDMA model of Verizon Wireless
the galaxy s5 active and now the galaxy
s5 prime we've given the galaxy s5 and
all its current variants a fair amount
of attention but sometimes in all the
excitement and the sheer amount of
information we have to parse through
it's easy to overlook some of the fun
yet less important details those looking
for the nitty gritty or some of the oft
overlooked features of the galaxy s5
this video is for you here are three fun
things to do on the galaxy s5 toolbox
despite his prime location in the quick
setting toggles in the notification
shade is an easy feature to overlook
when I first tried the galaxy s5 no one
had really said much of anything about
it and I didn't know what it was
basically it's a chat head style
shortcut tool that gives you access to
your favorite and most used applications
tap the bubble to expand and tap the
application you want to open in settings
you can select up to five shortcuts to
appear in toolbox I selected apps like
Chrome Evernote Plume and Rdio since I
typically use those applications most
tap once more to close tool box and the
bubble will become translucent when not
in focus if it gets in the way you can
drag it around the screen and to disable
it simply tap the quick settings toggle
in the notification shade one in
addition to the Galaxy S five this year
is the fingerprint scanner which is
integrated into the physical home button
of course you can use the fingerprint
scanner as a security lock for your
phone but you can also use it for
third-party applications for instance
you can use it to authenticate PayPal
transactions but one of my favorite uses
for the fingerprint scanner is
integration with LastPass LastPass is a
third-party password manager that stores
all of your usernames and passwords so
you don't have to remember them all you
only need to remember your LastPass
master password and log in to have
access to all of your individual account
credentials however with the Galaxy S
five you can use your fingerprint to
bypass the master password and quickly
log into any application on your phone
set up is a breeze simply confirm
fingerprint password Reap romped when
you first log in to last
on your phone then instead of typing in
your password each time which can get
annoying simply slide your finger over
the home button and login finally slow
motion video
the Galaxy s5s camera has the ability to
shoot in Ultra HD but it also has the
ability to shoot at different speeds
half 1/4 or 1/8 the more shooting speeds
this slow motion does come at the
expense of some quality shooting at any
slow motion rate will drop the
resolution to 720p but the effect is
both dramatic and extremely fun to play
around with shooting something as simple
as water splashing or ice breaking terms
from something mundane you'll have to
clean up to a really fun mess don't
believe us try it yourself what other
fun things have you found to do with
your Galaxy s5 tell us in the comments
