intera comm and this is another episode
of iOS app takes in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it fou de lis is a free
application available in the App Store
the last review recipes that your
friends have submitted either through
Facebook or through the food Elise
server so what this application allows
you to do is to view recipes so let's
say I wanted to view this recipe let's
do is click on here and the recipe will
be loads in it and can do all the photos
you can view the how many people have
saved this the comments the ingredients
list right down here and I can also view
the intrusive move if I click on this
link I can view all the information on
how to prepare this particular item scan
pages is free application veil in the
app store that allows you to scan
various documents and then save them as
PDF files on your iOS device so here let
me take the photo of a document here and
now I'll just select use and now all I
have to do is to align the page with
these little circles and click clean up
and now the page will be rendered into a
more readable format I can export it and
also save it directly to my iOS device
taxi magic is a free application on the
App Store the lush to make online
bookings through the taxi magic
associated taxi services so right now I
don't have any in my area but if i want
i can just click on one of these call
and then I think that call a taxi
provider directly it from my iOS device
if I was in downtown Seattle I can just
assign that city and now I can use one
of these Seattle orange cab and I can
just click book and then I can book the
taxi directly from this application a
breaker is 0 am paid for application of
it on the app store the object of the
game is to you have shoot these
projectiles at these objects up here and
to try to destroy the most amount in the
set number of shots that you have so
right here I have this weapon and this
one that splits into three separate
projectiles so then I can just shoot
this one here and they're linked
together so hopefully they'll all
explode ok so here I have one shot left
and we'll try to shoot it up here and
try to get as high as we can we got
nine percent so that's good enough to
move on to the next level Google Earth
is a free application of an app store
that works very similarly to the Google
Earth application available on your
computer so here we can view my current
location it will show me right there I
can also search for other things let's
say I wonder search for starbucks i can
just do that and I'll show me all the
starbucks in my location I can just
click on one of them I can use
multi-touch gestures to move the world
around I can also a pan it as scroll it
from my side to side and I can also just
a realign it by clicking up at the
compass and I will set it back at how it
should be so this has been another
