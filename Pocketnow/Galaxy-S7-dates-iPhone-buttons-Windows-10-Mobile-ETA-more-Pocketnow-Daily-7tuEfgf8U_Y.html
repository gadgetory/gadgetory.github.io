watch 0 s two and 0 s 10 elcapitan
rumors kind of the galaxy s7 might see
an earlier launch than expected and
carrier leagues provide insight on
windows 10 mobile am I met iveta a
little upset because the day is already
ending and I've still got a ton of work
but show must go on this is parking out
daily the official news today sharp with
Apple as the company has just pushed
beta 2 for a watch OS to iOS 9 and also
OS 10 El Capitan or an cuppy thing as
it's supposed to be pronounced and well
we've only got book fixes to report here
apparently there are some minor changes
in iconography in addition to some
changes in the keyboard of the iPad but
beware some of us particularly me have
not received watch os/2 yet or even iOS
9 is apparently there are some issues
and Apple apparently pull things for a
little while Kiwi pose it as we learn
more now a very highly anticipated
product for this year is windows 10
mobile we don't know exactly what it's
going to launch and even though some
thought that would happen shortly after
Windows 10 for the desktop report said
q3 and now we've got sfr telecom from
France stating that it'll happen until
october or november according to a
roadmap that just got leaked so yeah
october or november right after every
other hot phone is launched in the fall
right and speaking of the hot phones
that we will see for the fall of this
year is the galaxy note 5 but one
product that we were expecting to see is
the galaxy note 5 edge or whatever the
name will be for this product and some
trusted sources from career stating that
even though we might see the same
specifications that we heard for the
galaxy s5 5.9 inch display yhd etc etc
but soon as the edge product is not
going to make it and we wonder if it has
anything to do with that galaxy s6 plus
edge or edge plus and I just get
confused with these long name sorry now
something that is totally unexpected for
the fall is a galaxy s7 particularly
because the galaxy s6 lineup ever since
we remember half
ends early every year but it seems that
Samsung is not satisfied when it's 45
million units sold so far seems that the
company wants to set another product in
the market to compete with the
next-generation iphone that happens in
September so apparently we might be
getting that next generation galaxy by
sometime then and we wonder if that's
not just going to be the plus very that
we've been talking about but yeah
apparently an s7 could be the case as
well we'll see and finally for the very
interesting pet and trademarks of the
day let's talk about Apple's new tddi
single chip technology the concept here
is that apparently the home but will not
be necessary anymore apparently Apple
will be able to build touch ID into the
display of the next generation iphone or
whichever iphone that may be and yeah
there are even options for home button
gestures to be applied through for such
technology and yeah these are new things
that Apple has been doing particularly
with the new macbook and the Apple watch
so if this makes sense for the company
to figure out a way to remove moving
parts from its display mainly because it
generates a lot of customers going to
swap devices over a faulty home button
so yeah it could be the case but it does
lead me to the question of the day if
you had to pick between capacitive
displays or capacitive buttons should I
say or home buns the typical pressie
buttons which ones would you pick
because in my case honestly I prefer
hardware buttons I prefer having
something to press capacitive buttons
are always so easy to press without
wanting to do so but leave us a comment
down below what is your case friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
