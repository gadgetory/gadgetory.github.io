and I've been spending the last week or
so playing with YouTube TV and the
Dodgers are playing Chicago while I
record this so I'm just going to leave
this running on my phone while we talk
about it starting off with 40 channels
for 35 bucks a month this is not a
direct competitor against the service
like Netflix or Hulu more this is taking
aim at DirecTV Comcast's new Xfinity
streaming service or another third-party
player or something like sling TV and
that's backed up by an unlimited cloud
DVR as many episodes of as many
different TV shows as you'd want to keep
captured but those shows will expire
after around nine months on Google
servers one more nice little perk though
this is attached to a primary Google
account that Google account can create a
family plan which will allow up to five
other users to share credentials and
also stream TV and have their own cloud
storage so your DVR isn't getting filled
up with someone else's shows YouTube TV
works with pretty much anything
smartphones tablets laptops and then if
you want to stream directly to a TV you
can punch through something like a
chromecast for exactly the same type of
streaming solutions we've already been
using with YouTube Netflix and Google
Play now the funny thing is I actually
wasn't super hyped up about YouTube TV
but today it launched I get a flurry of
emails from my wife who was super
excited to give something like this a
shot we're one of those families that's
looking at paring back on our current
cable plan we'd be getting fewer
channels in our current cable package
but we'd be saving about 50 bucks a
month over what we're currently paying
for in them and largely getting the
channels that we actually do watch we
just have to fill in the gaps for a few
other channels like HBO Go and taking a
quick look around the app this is
extremely well laid out and it
definitely fits that sort of aesthetic
that we see from Google Play when you
open the app you're greeted by this main
home view it's sort of a general
overview on the things you've already
been watching with a few little
recommendations sprinkled in there for
things you might be interested in as
wipe to the left gets you to your
library I actually don't have anything
in my library because we've been using
my wife's account but then an additional
swipe to the right will bring you into
the live catalog of television that's
available to you in that moment you get
a little ticker list of all the channels
that
associated with your plan and as you
scroll through them a live feed will
start streaming through the title bar of
that network compared to some of the
other cable apps I've played with this
is a really clean and playful way to
kind of browse through content without
having to fire up a channel wait for it
to load then decide you don't want to
watch that then switch to another
channel and wait for that to load this
is much cleaner and much faster and
helping you find something to really
watch and not just look at a bunch of
options video quality does seem to come
in better than what we currently get
through cable when we're watching it on
the same TV my super not techy wife was
watching an episode of The Simpsons had
to comment on the fact that it looked a
lot better than when we were watching it
on an HD channel through our cable
package of course it's not all roses and
this is still something it's not a beta
service but it's early days for YouTube
TV especially as Google has to hammer
out market by market across the United
States what channels will be allowed on
some kind of streaming platform this has
been one of the biggest hurdles biggest
stumbling blocks in migrating this media
from traditional broadcast through cable
and then into a streaming solution and
because it's not available in all
markets it also means that this is a
location-aware service for example our
editor-in-chief Tony he tried to fire up
YouTube TV using a VPN but again it was
still tied to the GPS of his phone so
even though he was going through some
sort of American channel to end up in
the United States digitally his organic
location was still overseas
so YouTube wouldn't allow him to set up
an account and with any new Google
service we always have to float that
question just how much a part of the
product are the users actually becoming
that personal bucket of user information
floating around on Google services about
you that's how much of that information
is really being used to sort of leverage
against your own spending habits serving
you more advertisements you still have
to watch commercials through the service
it's just like any other type of
broadcast TV you can disable some of
that tracking but then again that's
going to cut back on the accuracy of the
recommendations that Google is going to
serve you and that also brings up one
last interesting little con to the
service as it's currently constructed
for example
I've got a big ol nerd crush on Sam
Rockwell I think he's a phenomenal
performer so I punch in Sam Rockwell's
name in the youtube search app and it
pulls up a couple movies that he's been
in and it also links to a couple YouTube
videos on YouTube YouTube TV it's a nice
little synergy there but what I really
like to do is set up an alert or set up
a marker or set up an automatic record
for every time Sam Rockwell's shows up
say on the talk show if he's pitching a
new movie maybe he's in some little
indie joint I wasn't aware of and I want
to know that he's in it that's not
something you can currently do with
YouTube TV so that's definitely some
room to grow I would love to see that
search better utilized for capturing
content and the content that we don't
even know has been produced yet but
after the first week impressions pretty
positive this is the service that we're
looking at continuing I'm going to try
and compare it against something like
sling TV I know my wife is definitely
more excited about the Google tie and
the fact that we can keep separate
accounts we can set up an account for
our daughter and not get hit with a
bunch of kids shows on our own personal
accounts so that that could be really
helpful and for us is we're trying to
pare back kind of rein in some of those
costs which have gotten a little out of
control on our cable package YouTube TV
offers up a solution which gets us most
of what we want at a far lower price and
what we're currently paying and of
course we want to hear from you if you
tried out YouTube TV yet fired up that
free month to see what this is all about
and what are your thoughts do you think
Google's on the right track here or do
you think a service like Netflix has
more promise for a digital online
streaming company like Google Drive is a
comment down below because those are the
kinds of conversations I love getting
