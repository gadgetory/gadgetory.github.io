trade shows in a lot of great product
announcements but there are still those
devices that I still wouldn't give even
to my worst enemy so I am high meadow
meadow this is pocket now and these are
a top five devices to skip for spring
2013 number five any amazon kindle fire
and I mean anyone even if it's the old
one the new kindle fire HD v 8.9 these
are good tablets but the problem with
them is that they're stuck on amazon's
ecosystem and yes you can route these
tablets to do everything you want but
not every customer out there is capable
of doing that and if you're not stuck in
wanting to buy everything that smells
Amazon as if Amazon had everything then
we do recommend you skip these tablets
for now number four any samsung galaxy
device that's not an s3 and s4 or galaxy
note 2 and the reason why is because
Samsung has proven to be great when it
comes to their high-end smartphones but
then they come out with all these galaxy
s3 mini galaxy s4 mini galaxy s whatever
that are not the s3 or the note 2 or the
s4 and the problem you get here is that
you don't get software updates and if
you asked me I would also skip the whole
tablet lineup from Samsung as they still
haven't been able to figure that one out
either number 3 the HTC windows phone 8x
a very beautiful phone but that's pretty
much it if you think about it if you
want to go Windows Phone and this day
and age when it comes to your wallet
added features and just about everything
you'll get well no kiss pretty much the
product to beat sadly HCC brought us an
iconic design of a phone that is sadly
not capable of doing anything better
than any other Lumia smartphone out
there even the low-end Lumia so again if
you want a pretty phone well the 8x will
probably be for you but if you want to
get more bang for your buck I'd go lumia
number to the Microsoft Surface RT
notice RT not the windows 8 pro model
sadly the problem of the surface RT is
that this was a great idea a beautiful
device a great concept with terrible
execution there are no applications out
there for it and you can't run any
applications from any market because
nobody's pretty much built anything for
it but aside
that it is a very slow tablet and when
you consider the fact that you're paying
as much money for that tablet as you
would pay for an iPad well most people
will go for the iPad and the top number
one device we recommend you skip for
spring 2013 is the ipad mini a very
beautiful tablet gorgeous design it runs
iOS it has the largest ecosystem out
there but it does not have a Retina
display and its biggest problem is that
there is the ipad mini 2 coming out
probably very soon so the problem is
that you'll probably have the ipad mini
2 coming soon with everything you don't
get the retina display a better
processor better performance everything
and then you'll be stuck with the ipad
mini one which is sadly well probably
not underpowered but it's just the man
product probably one of the biggest
disappointments of the year since we
were expecting the full-fledged ebook
reader coming from Apple and then we got
the mini which again will probably cater
to some people but then when I see 5
year olds out there with the iPad Mini
is their tablet it makes you wonder if
you're really carrying a high-end
product that's it for today's top five
thank you very much for watching I am
