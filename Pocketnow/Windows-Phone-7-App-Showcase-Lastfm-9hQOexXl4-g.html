calm i know some of you have been
wondering about last.fm on windows phone
7 so we're going to check it out right
now so here we go there it is pinned to
the Start menu and load it you can also
launch it from the music and videos hub
and here we are that was pretty quick
you got profile events radio or logout
and we got recent tracks over here and
recent stations more room for recent
station so I only have three there and
here's the events so you can see some
concerts nearby let's go to profile
let's just going to show recent tracks
recent stations again top artists so
there's that and let's try radio about
recommended radio so this is going to
set our speakers oh there we go to just
fix some music and start playing for me
here we have just a little bit in our
menu we have you can say you like the
song I love it you can ban it from
playing on any of your stations you can
stop there you can go to the next one
and you can turn scrabbling on or off
and you can say don't play while them
while the screen is locked so I shut it
off it's going to still play so that's
good can't swipe
got to press the next button you can see
it's picking up my eye color choice from
the start menu preferences there that's
good and we can go back and it'll still
play now you see it now playing in there
so we can navigate within the app while
also listening to music but oh it stops
stops when you go to a different program
go back
so that's kind of pain but you should
stay in the program if you want to be
listening to last.fm music and that's
pretty much it you can also search of
course there it is anyway thanks for
watching that please thumbs up if you
liked this video and program and that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
