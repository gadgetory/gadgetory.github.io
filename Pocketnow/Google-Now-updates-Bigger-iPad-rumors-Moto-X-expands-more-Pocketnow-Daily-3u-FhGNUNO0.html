features to iOS users larger iPad rumors
into a more of a macbook error probably
iPad pro in the future and yes the LG G
flex isn't just curved it can also bend
I'm hi Mary betta and now that I can
bend my phone can I also fold it
whenever I need to this is out
daily especially off with some official
and cool news as Google has just pushed
new updates other Google Search
application for iOS where you pretty
much get all the Google now search
features that you get on Android or at
least most of them like for example you
can now say ok Google and the
application will respond if you haven't
launched since this is iOS but obviously
you get the feature you get reminders
you get other things that currently
Android customers are enjoying and
obviously it's great to see this now in
iOS just as much as I know that people
running Ice Cream Sandwich enjoy it as
well right and do you remember this
group of HTC executives that left the
company to start up their new smart
phone company called Kazaam well the
fruit of this company has just begun
their launching seven phones no I'm not
kidding seven phones at the same time
from high-end smartphones to the lowest
end of smart phones running android and
these phones have some weird odd names
linked to the description for details
sadly the highest end of their phones is
sadly still what we would call a
material but it's great to see them
starting it's great to see their
products and let's hope they price them
right stay tuned for that and if you
still want to get a customizable Moto X
but not on AT&amp;amp;T it seems that the
exclusivity deal is about to end as
we've got new rumors that moto maker
will now be available for tmobile this
week and probably for sprint next week
obviously these are just rumors but it's
great to see that the feature is now
available to more people even though we
would just wish that you can also
customize the camera while you're at it
now let's talk about the LG G flex as
those of you that were just thinking
that this phone was just the curb phone
like the galaxy round and that's what I
was thinking actually we have some
videos now to show us that the phone is
not just curve you can also bend the
damn thing you put on a table you can
push it down watch the video and notice
absolutely everything that you can do
with it
which is just again just bending the
phone down which shows that the phone
must be resilient to Falls and just
about every sort of impact which is
great aside from that scratch proof back
that apparently it has so stay tuned for
that I just really can't find the usage
for it but still it's great to have and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got some rumors coming from
Foxconn that apparently Apple has just
made an order for bigger iPads and for
those of you thinking that that would
never happen you know Apple would never
bring other form factors to iPads then
we got the ipad mini you know how the
story once so apparently the company is
working on building a 12 point nine inch
ipad and it seems that this ipad is not
just going to be bigger apparently this
is the ipad pro that some of us have
been thinking about ever since apple
launched the ipad air recently so that
leaves you through the question of the
day would you find the need for a 12
point nine inch ipad is that something
that you're looking forward to because
in my particular case if this is just
gonna be a bigger version of iOS i would
not be interested if this would run OS
10 min shirt fine bring it to me but
other than that let's just see what we
get so leave us a comment down below
