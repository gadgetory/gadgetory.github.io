recommend an Android wear SmartWatch for
fitness but it seems a company finally
decided to do something about that
I'm hi Mary vet I with pocket now here
we are unboxing and first impressions of
the Moto 360 sport
the Moto 360 continues to be one of the
most iconic Android wear designs in the
market and its new sport variant intends
to bring some of that charm to the road
which we highly praised as most
smartwatches that are built for fitness
look really ugly this actually extends
to the packaging which looks almost
identical to the box that we saw with
the second generation Moto 360 there are
three color variants of the watch but
we're happy to see that our review unit
is the black model as getting the
silicone bands dirty while training is
extremely easy popping the Box open we
see that the accessories included are
fairly identical to the regular Moto 360
we have the same qi wireless charging
dock with a micro USB connector and some
literature this is actually an odd 45
millimeter watch that matches the Huawei
watch in its size and it's attached
smaller than the larger Moto 360 it
sports a new hybrid any light display
that is supposedly easier to read in
direct sunlight and it's protected by a
sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 in a nice
textured ring as well
the watch is ip67 water and dust proof
and the silicone band surrounding it is
soft to the touch but also non removable
something that makes us worry as to the
durability of this watch at the bottom
we have the usual motorola heart rate
sensor and all the other Android wear
sensors that were used to like an
accelerometer gyro etc but what makes
this watch stand apart is very deep
within as this is one of the few if not
only the second Android wear SmartWatch
with GPS connectivity the rest is pretty
much your average moto 360 with the same
Snapdragon 400 processor four gigs of
ram and a three hundred milli amp hour
battery and yes your beloved flat tire
as well so far I'll admit the watch
feels really light in the arm which is
essential if you're gonna use this for
running but we're gonna give this watch
its deserve pocket now Fitness treatment
over the next coming weeks so make sure
you shimon in the comments over any
particular tests that you would like us
