wireless and simple jailbreaks for all
of us immortals the Wall Street Journal
seems to have another control leak of
the argument 5 in 15 million rifle fires
have always been ordered for production
all this and more coming up right now
hello everybody I'm hi Natalie that and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show would go through all this week
school and they're not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
start this week off with the cool
jailbreakers have all the fun they
pretty much can do whatever they want
with their iphones uh except making it
go to work for them pretty much all you
can do is install whatever you want from
Cydia and make it do things that
currently apple doesn't want it to do so
if you help back on jailbreaking in the
past because it was too complicated
you'll be happy to know that comex on
the death team have already released
version 3 of jailbreakme com all you
have to do is navigate from your mobile
safari browser to jailbreakme.com and
then once in there just tap on free just
like if you were downloading an
application and you'll see your device
downloading an app called cydia which is
the app store for jailbreakers and it's
a simple download it's pretty quick and
once that happens that's it your device
is jailbroken and well before you ask me
why should you jailbreak just to have an
idea 1 million people three devices just
on the first day that jailbreakme com
was available it works currently for the
iphone for the 3gs the ipod touch 3rd
and 4th generation and the ipad and yes
even the ipad 2 if you're rocking iOS
4.3 point 3 and well applications like
for example swipe the keyboard that's so
famous on android work for jailbreakers
only so why not you're not really losing
anything let's face at Apple uses the
wall street journal for their controlled
leaks every time they do so their stocks
skyrocket and this is the case where
Apple stock is currently climbing more
than 20 points because the Wall Street
Journal is reporting that the next
generation iphone 5 will bring a
radically new design it'll be thinner
and lighter which comes in conflict with
current rumors that will be similar to
the iphone 4 aside from that it will
bring an 8 megapixel camera and also
bring that dual Qualcomm chip that will
allow cdma and
gsm services within the same device so
we can expect with next-generation
device to work on all carriers pretty
much not really sure what to expect for
tmobile but aside from that well rumors
have it that Apple will be releasing the
neck serration device in September that
does line up with rumors now what's
interesting is that Apple's rumors also
have it that it'll can the ipod touch
and bring a cheaper iPhone now other
rumors out there have it that Apple is
working on a cheaper iPhone that only
works through 3g n allows voice over IP
calls so it's really interesting to see
what Apple will do with the
next-generation iphone and if a cheaper
iPhone will also make it again Wall
Street Journal reports sure almost
confirmed so we'll see what happens and
well the top rumor mill off Apple's
already ordered 50 million iPhones to be
manufactured by pegatron not Megatron
pegatron which is the same manufacturer
that built the verizon iphones for a
September release interesting to see
that 50 million iPhones will be
manufactured only by one company because
you know apple also uses Foxconn so I
wonder how many iPhones is Apple
planning to produce for their September
release it's really interesting to see
what we can expect from here on because
apples been behaving really weird lately
AT&amp;amp;T is currently conducting a survey to
customers asking them whether they want
a slide-out keyboard on the next
generation iphone really weird and aside
from that it seems that Apple's also
filing a patent for a stylus even though
Steve Jobs even claimed in Macworld 2007
that nobody wants a stylus you had a
point Steve but it's really you know
sometimes you really need it for things
like an iPad on certain applications for
notes so we'll see what happens in the
end with these rumors and while Apple's
App Store's barely three years old and
Apple is already celebrating 15 billion
downloads interesting to see that four
hundred thousand applications are
already being offered for the iPhone
under thousand applications for the iPad
and well currently the App Store works
in 90 countries and serves more than 200
million iOS devices really interesting
congratulations Apple on this new
milestone and well 2.5 bill
dollars have already been paid to
developers so you can see why there's so
much frenzy over iOS devices especially
by developers I mean that's where
they're making money not the same case
in the past I mean the App Store is
really not a groundbreaking already
existed in the past but I guess Apple is
the one that's really been able to pull
it off smartly
well that does it for the coolest
continue on with the not so cool the cat
and mouse game continues jailbreakme.com
has just been released with version 3.0
and Apple is already made official that
they'll be releasing a patch to cancel
the PDF exploit that allows
jailbreakme.com to work obviously
that'll have to happen on a future
release so as long as you don't upgrade
your iphone to you the next generation
iOS you'll pretty much have your device
jailbroken but if that next generation
Iowa's version is iOS 5 you'd be crazy
not to upgrade so sad news because iOS 5
is really compelling to upgrade to so
anyways that's the way this happens and
whoa I OS 5 beta 2 continues on with
more bugs though this time it's getting
hotter than ever why because the
developer is already claiming that
Apple's iOS 5 beta 2 was responsible for
his sync cable burning out on his iphone
4 and well there are so many ways for a
sync cable to you know lose wiring if
you don't know how to handle it
correctly so we're not really sure what
to expect here but Apple everybody's
waiting for that beta 3 I mean I'm tired
of my iPad tool resetting itself all the
time I mean you should figure out what
to do man release candidate gold master
beta 3 whatever you want just bring out
a new release that handles all these
bugs man that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high middle you better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
