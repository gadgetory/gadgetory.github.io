telling us the story of the galaxy noted
it's unpacked event in New York City how
it has served as the vanguard platform
to innovate in things like s-pen curved
displays which are now a standard on its
flagships and also the trend for phones
to continue to grow in size
surely the note 7 was more a setback
than a step forward so the biggest
question today is of the Galaxy Note 8
can help the s8 in fixing that I'm I'm
gonna leave a tie with pocket now and
it's time to go hands-on brought to you
by D brand so let's get the obvious
question off our backs first if you've
ever seen a galaxy as a plus you've seen
a good deal of the Galaxy Note 8 and
that's actually a good thing we've got a
gorgeous blend of shiny aluminum and
glass all sandwiched into a device that
feels incredibly light for all of its
heft yes this is definitely a
fingerprint magnet which is even more
noticeable in the funky lights that were
available in this venue this is also not
a small phone and in the case of the
Galaxy Note there's a purpose for that
this is meant to be a notepad
replacement for your productive needs so
a larger canvas here is a must as a
result this is Samsung's largest
infinity displayed and insane 6.3 inches
diagonal it continues to be of Super
AMOLED technology meaning punchy color
and deep blacks come standard and if you
like that 18 point five by nine taller
aspect ratio of the Galaxy s8 lineup its
back here in addition to the edge
features that we also enjoyed the
biggest selling point Samsung's much
acclaimed the s-pen makes a comeback
visually it looks the same as last
year's and Samsung was in really
specific as to have the tilt features of
the tablet S Pen are making the jump to
the phone now the S Pen is only as good
as the software backing it up and we've
got a few additions that we'll go
through in our review in the future but
for now probably the most interesting
ones are the ability to scribble
animated messages and the fact that the
always-on display now supports up to 100
page
notes that you could scribble while the
displays off internally the galaxy note
is a blend of great and not-so-great
great being the powerful Snapdragon 835
processor from Qualcomm with a boost of
six eighths of RAM and options that
begin at 64 gigs of expandable storage
as for the not-so-great well we have a
smaller a 3300 milliamp hour battery so
only time will tell if this virtual
notepad would actually last you the
whole day now to be honest with you I'm
not really worried because Samsung's
adoption of the more power efficient
Android 7.1.1 could give the battery
hand visually the whole UI looks
identical to Samsung's experienced UX
that we already know say for some minor
updates like being able to hide and
deploy the navigation buttons easily as
we currently see with the galaxy s 8
active Samsung is also deploying a new
feature called a pair where multitasking
applications can now be preset to a
shortcut which is really cool
and speaking of shortcuts the big sweet
button is back and it now includes a
couple of really cool features and like
being able to set complex strings of
commands to work by just telling it a
few key words that only you would
understand something which is kind of
cool and then another thing which is
kind of cool is the new camera
we've got dual 12 megapixel cameras both
with OIS one being regular and the other
being telephoto now you know me I'm not
really a fan of telephoto lenses nor the
way that Samsung has deployed the zoom
features because the commands are kind
of separate but one thing that I do
praise is the company's approach to
portrait mode you can now dial back the
amount of blur in the background and you
can even switch things back to a regular
photo even after it's already taken
overall the Galaxy Note 8 continues to
be Samsung's cream-of-the-crop when it
comes to smartphones it may not be the
vanguard and daring phone we saw in
previous generations but it's
understandable for Samsung to keep
things conservative given last year's
incidents whether all these features are
truly productive or not as something
we'll definitely be covering in our full
review coming very
soon while that happens remember the
glass back will need some protection the
brand skins will eliminate those
fingerprints and add some grip to your
upcoming Galaxy Note 8 or any other
