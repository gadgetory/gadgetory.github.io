pocket now calm Samsung did a really
good job on the hardware on the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 it's thin it's like it even has
some metal on it in this video we're
going to take a closer look at the
hardware of a Galaxy Tab 7.7 let's get
to it so it's really cool about the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 and this holds true for
the original Galaxy Tab is that you can
hold it in one hand you can even put it
in a pocket it's that small and portable
that can fit in your pocket and yet it's
big enough to where it's a true tablet
the Galaxy Tab 7 obviously had a smaller
screen but it was also pocketable and
very portable and a lot of people liked
this smaller screen size because you can
actually type in portrait on it without
having to stretch your thumbs too much
now this particular unit is the Wi-Fi
only version they also have a gsm 3g
version which will work on AT&amp;amp;T right
now you can get the Wi-Fi version for
the in the high 500s and the GSM version
in the six hundreds over at Negri
electronics comm that'll give you 16
gigabytes of storage now this is coming
to Verizon Wireless as an LTE tablet
price and availability has not been
anounced but look out for that if you
want a lower subsidized price on the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 so of course we have a
seven point seven diagonal screen here
and the resolution is the same as the
galaxy note same as the 8.9 and the 10.1
Galaxy Tabs that is 1280 down by 800
across and of course because we have a
smaller screen the same number of pixels
the pixel density the PPI is better on
the seven-point-seven than it is on the
8.9 and especially the 10.1 which means
the text is crisper than the 8.9 and the
10.1 and the really special thing about
this screen is that it's Super AMOLED
plus so for the first time we have a
tablet that has the amazing clarity the
amazing contrast and color depth of an
AMOLED screen and it's Super AMOLED plus
which means the sub pixel configuration
is not pentile like it is on the Galaxy
Note for example it is RGB and we're to
talk more about the screen in a future
video
so let's move around the device before
we turn it over to the back up here
oddly we have a speaker and we're going
to talk about why there's a speaker in a
future video I've got a front-facing
camera here 2 megapixels I've got that
buttonless design afforded by honeycomb
and this will be upgradeable to Ice
Cream Sandwich which is great because
honeycomb is pretty terrible even on a
device like this which has a 1.4
gigahertz Exynos processor one of the
best processors out there honeycomb just
isn't well tuned and of course Ice Cream
Sandwich is coming soon and this thing
should fly with Ice Cream Sandwich of
course you've got a Samsung logo down
here and we've got that blueish tint to
the screen if I kind of move it in the
light which is characteristic of the
Super AMOLED plus screen if you got a if
you have a samsung galaxy s2 or galaxy
note you know the little blue glow that
you get thanks to the Super AMOLED plus
display well let's turn over to the side
here super thin let's compare this to
the original Galaxy Tab there is no
contest
it is extremely thin very very light and
it feels great in hand we've gotten
microSD expansion here if you want to
add some more space which is great
because 16 gigabytes isn't that much
space once you add some movies and add
some music to your tablet on the bottom
here we've got Samsung's proprietary
jack of course no tablets yet have
microUSB they're all proprietary
hopefully there will be some unified
standard in the future we've got dual
speakers which produce a lot of sound
which is great it's really fantastic
using the tablet to watch video just the
perfect size to stream Netflix or or
what have you over here on the side just
in the same place as you would find on
the Galaxy s2 and the other Samsung
devices we've got power and volume and
flipping over to the top we have a
microphone and there's also a microphone
down here so a secondary microphone for
noise cancellation at a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack
let's turn over to the back now in the
original post on pocket now that we made
we commented that the back is plastic
and not metal that is not the case it is
actually metal which is awesome to see
on a Samsung tablet reason we thought it
was plastic was because it just
doesn't have really a metallic feel
until you set it aside for a few minutes
and let it come to room temperature and
you pick it up and you notice how the
back is cool to the touch and you know
that that means that the back is metal
compared to the top and bottom parts
here which are plastic so you've got
this beautiful brush metal design really
striking and after just a couple of days
of use look it's scratched already so
that might that might tell the story
about how resilient this metal actually
is on the back we've got just a 3
megapixel camera Oblates not 5 or 8 and
an LED flash inside we've got a 50 100
milli amp hour battery that coupled with
the power saving of the Exynos processor
and the AMOLED screen means that this
thing has a really good battery life
we'll talk about that more in an
upcoming video other things to note is
that it has 1 gigabyte of RAM which is
plenty of multitasking prowess and in
terms of what you're looking at about
three hundred and thirty five grams so
one of the most lightweight tablets out
there definitely the one of the most
thin at 7.9 millimetres this is a really
great tablet to hold in the hand coming
up soon we're going to talk about what
Samsung has done in terms of software on
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 if you want
to see more pictures be sure to check
out the link in the description we're
gonna put some more up so you can get a
even a better view of a Galaxy Tab 7.7
which is turning out to be a really cool
tablet if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and of course thank
you for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
