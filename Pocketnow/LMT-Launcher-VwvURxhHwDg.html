packing.com and today I'm going to show
you LMT version 0.5 and this is a beta
version program and what it's going to
allow you to do is use multi-touch
gestures to actually assign different
programs and different actions on your
Windows mobile device so this is only
for capacitive touchscreen devices like
the hd2 here okay so now you can use two
fingers to activate certain programs or
actions on my Windows Mobile capacitive
touchscreen device so I'm going to go
double right which launches the Start
menu go double left which takes me back
to home now you can also assign these
and I'll show you how to do that in just
a second I can go double up double down
I can go double arrow right double arrow
left I can make a square or a triangle
so as you see all those certain actions
have worked on this device there is a
couple of thirds but I will show you
those in just a second so let's say that
I want to have one of these actions be
learned by a program so all I have to do
is open up a program let's see here what
do I want to assign go to tools and I'm
going to assign my digital compass and
if I want to assign a program all I have
to do is do a double question mark and
now whichever gesture I use will be
learned by my device so I'm going to
choose double arrow right so now if I go
back to the home screen and I just do
double arrow right it will launch my
digital compass which is pretty cool I
can do this for any one of those actions
but be careful because if you use the
question mark twice you're learning
action won't work anymore so we'll go
back and if I want to assign another
program let's see let's say I want to
assign my album's I can go double
question mark and now let's choose
double up so if I go back home again and
I just go double up it will launch my
albums so I'm going to change something
else let's see
I want to have my task manager be
assigned as a as an action as you see
how they use a lot of programs all the
time so I'm just going to do double
question mark and I'm just going to
choose double down because it's pretty
quick we'll go back home and double down
and now we're back at our task manager
so as you see these motions are very
quick to activate certain programs or
application or whatever you want to have
a shortcut to now this utility is pretty
quick to launch programs as you see if I
want to go to task manager again just
double down and if I want to go to my
digital compass and I don't want to
click right there all I have to do is go
double arrow right digital compass if I
want to go back to Start menu or home I
guess it would be then all I do is
double left so this is LMT
version 0.5 and the application is
actually free on xda-developers
and I will post a link I'm plucking out
of comments on how to get this thanks
