calm and i'm here with the surface 2 and
the new surface pro 2 with some new
keyboards and we're going to check them
out alright first we'll look at the
surface to
very thin is it thinner than the RT a
little bit
and this is a nice silver color chosen
change eluded the actual difference
between 0
because it's an upgrade yeah what it was
you all black in the bucket and we have
two levels and the micro SD card is
still over here down there yeah
we have the logo there now
and this one has the new touch cover can
we see the backlight aha kind of right
here as a bone to actually address the
lady on the table brightness controls
there we go
ok
and this has gestures to right across
the whole keyboard how do those work I
only have two better than anyone ever
tried them
ok I think I figured out the touch cover
gestures my dude three fingers
see the cursor is moving
put them up the cursor moves up and down
the person is down so we can move the
cursor around like that and then if I
type so there's some predictive words
showing up and then I can slide the
spacebar well that didn't work all right
again and slide the spacebar and now I
can choose the words they're all right
and this is the surface pro 2 also with
dual mode kickstand
and the risk this is very similar to the
surface for the original surface pro got
dents along the edge
pretty much the same thickness same
color the only difference is we have a
surface logo on the kickstand
and this is a 128
but we also have a two angles that's
pretty good and this is the new type
keyboard I can have the old type
keyboard is here and you can see the
difference
that's a more plasticky area there and
this is a some more like the touch
covers for the trackpad but the keys
let's move pretty nicely
you can tell they're slightly less
movement in the keyboard versus the old
one but a still still feels great
I need to look at the thickness
the new type keyboard is up just a
little bit thinner it's hard to see it
right there
but there we have it our hands on on the
surface 2 and the surface pro 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
