calm today and in the following videos
we'll be taking a look at the samsung
omnia 7 which is believed to be the
european version of the AT&amp;amp;T Samsung
Focus we'll start with the hardware tour
after which we will take a look at the
software proprietary software which
comes from Samsung directly we will be
making some comparisons between the
samsung omnia 7 and the LG optimus 7
these two are believed to be the fastest
Windows Phone 7 is out there because
they have mass storage as opposed to SD
cards so we'll have pretty much some
great videos coming up stay tuned for
the hardware review you are so the
hardware MP samsung omnia 7 is not much
different than all the other windows
concerning devices out there with
microsoft laying down the chances
specifications for all audience which
will be producing Windows Phone 7
handsets so expect a 1 gigahertz
processor approximately the same amount
of RAM things which differ usually are
either build quality or camera quality
or software which the manufacturer in
our case samsung is giving away for free
for their users so without any further
ado let's take a look at the hardware on
beyond the SM right at the top we've got
the speaker grill let's just hope it
focuses we've got the speaker grill
right above the Samsung branding with
the light sensor and proximity sensors
at the top there's not much more on the
top on the bottom we've got two
capacitive buttons for back and search
out of the total free required on the
front of any windows phone 7 device the
star button is attacked out let's see if
you can hear that yes on the right side
we've got your power button so this is
where you power up the device and lower
down we have the camera button which is
to stage first stage for focusing and
the second stage for capturing the video
or picture at the back it's got your
typical 5 megapixel
with LED flash next to the speaker grill
we've got a place for the latch Windows
Phone branding Samsung logo and this
button here releases the back cover
which is a metal on the bottom we've got
your microphone and the volume rockers
on the left side for volume down and
volume up at the top we've got the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and the USB
port which is concealed by this door
here for syncing and charging let's take
a look at the battery the battery used
by Samsung in its omnia 7 is one of
fifteen hundred million powers right
there which should give you enough juice
for one and a half maybe two days with
moderate usage and compared to you LG's
battery in the Optimus seven witches of
the same size fifteen hundred million
powers we'll see how this device behaves
because LG was so fond saying that the
battery on the Optima seven outlives all
other windows from some hands-on
batteries let's see how the Vice
compares to some other popular devices
which you might know we have the omnia 7
here compared to the LG optimus seven
let's sleep there on the side by side
it's pretty much the same height in
terms of thickness the omnia 7 there's
the little little bit thinner let's take
a look at the omnia 7 next to the HTC
hd2 it's a little bit taller than the
hd2 and in terms of thickness will you
be the judge i'd say they're right
approximately the same thickness except
for the HD 2s camera which stands out a
little bit let's compare it to the
iphone 4 there's no one no debates here
the iphone 4 is smaller
but the camera the display on the
samsung omnia 7 is one of four inches
and it's a super amoled display like you
would find on the samsung focus and
we've got one more here to compare it to
the HTC Desire as you can see beyond the
smm is a little bit taller but it's also
a little bit thinner now talking about a
display which again is four inches and
the Super AMOLED I'm not sure if you can
see that it's got the bluish tint to it
which is particular to AMOLED screens
unfortunately it's not super amoled plus
like you would find on the brand new
samsung galaxy s2 but this has pretty
good contrast rate it has vibrant colors
so you will love this one let's just pop
in the battery and start it up goes in
like this and let's see for the first
launched their you got the samsung omnia
7 branding it shouldn't take more than
20 seconds then there's your windows
from animation and there we go welcome
to your samsung omnia 7 let's get
started english united kingdom will be
great of course we have no sim in it yet
we accept the terms of Windows Phone and
we go with the recommended settings we
live in a time zone appropriate for
Bucharest will set the clock later on
and we don't want to sign in at this
moment hold on and we've got our welcome
SMS which appears automatically
and let's take a look at the screen now
the colors are really really rich and
you can see the deep blacks of these
super amoled display let's try to find
some up pictures demo pictures
there we go really really nice colors so
we'll be back with some more comparisons
especially with the LG optimus Evan will
do side-by-sides and we'll see how long
the battery lasts on the omnia 7 thank
you very much for watching this was
engine be not taking a quick look at the
hardware on the samsung omnia 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
