seven and we should expect major changes
from the sixth see some real-life
pictures of the Huawei P 30 pro have
emerged and the periscopic camera here
and Tim Cook says we should expect some
mind-blowing things from Apple in the
coming years I'm Jaime Matt Rivera back
in the studio and boy do I wish I was
still in Barcelona with the snow this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals for a product
that already launched the Nokia n9
PureView yes our unit is here expect
some coverage very soon well it's
announced us availability already and
you can already get $100 off so far my
experience has been rather interesting
this is a paradigm shift when it comes
to photography as I see it it's been
really good so far but again wait for
our review now let's throw the galaxy s
10 and s 10 plus if you've seen our two
videos of this device already things
have been great so far I highly
recommend you watch the video where we
flew in a helicopter it's and won't set
rather than everything that was great
but probably the most interesting part
is the fact that this phone sold in two
hours with the s 9 + s 9 + sold in 24
that's a big deal and I kind of think
that it merits that amount of sale
that's great that was supposed to
spotlight over to Tim Cook and Apple
obviously the company has to figure out
again it's a trend of growth again and
according to what Tim Cook just said we
could expect some mind-blowing things
from the company in the near future we
hear a are goggles that he wants to make
MacBook Airs less expensive which he
definitely should I mean what's wrong
with that and that we should expect some
innovations in the Apple watch sector
and probably even a sound emitting
display from the iPhone all these things
let's just see when and how about if we
talk about the Huawei P 30 Pro we are
expecting an event to happen very soon
and some of us were bummed that the fact
that apparently it only had three
cameras and then when we started looking
at some leaked photos and we see that
one of those camera lenses is squared
we've got some sources claiming that
this actually brings the same zoom lens
photography that we saw from Oppo at MWC
whether that happens or not is going to
be
rather interesting and finally the
hottest news that I have to do with the
oneplus 7 we've got two separate news
showing it's the same thing one is the
design of the back that looks a very
interesting but the second one is where
we get to see a display that has no
bezels and we have a camera that pops up
this is great it's great that we see
oneplus adopting this technology
probably my biggest concerns is what's
gonna happen with the water resistance
because we know that the phones that
have this technology don't bring it let
us know in the comments down below what
do you think do you like this design do
you don't like it I know the oneplus
sixty did not have water resistance
certification but it was splash proof so
that's one of my biggest concerns leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know what you think friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow
what's not bugging out our comments
shrubs with our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one
and follow me on Twitter hang out just
what we got on Instagram that high
middle data please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
highly metal but I think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
