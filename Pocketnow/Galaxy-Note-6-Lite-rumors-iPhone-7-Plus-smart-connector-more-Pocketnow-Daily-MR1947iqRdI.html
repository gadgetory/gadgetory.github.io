lite version making the cut more details
on the iphone 7 claim that the renders
are highly exaggerated and a flexible
smartphone with the new display
technology is in the works I'm high
metal iveta and I'm not really a fan of
skulls on my t-shirts unless you're
offering me the hammer brothers
obviously this is Pauline out daily the
official news today begin with deals
those of you interested in Apple music
it's not a bad service just not my
favorite in particular well the company
has just lightened up to the fact that
Spotify has been offering student
discounts you can now get fifty percent
off if you qualify as a student and
there's a certain procedure to follow
but it's interesting to see that Apple
is not only changing the scheme of how
it charges in the United States but also
it's being smart about the whole
business other official news come from
masseuse those of you in the market for
the future zenfone 3 and we cannot wait
that was actually a really good lineup
of smartphones because there were a ton
of them seems of the zenfone 3 is slated
for May thirtieth set your calendars
there is an event happening in Taipei we
will be covering as much as we can about
it hopefully that's not the only Zen
product we get up hopefully a zen watch
the three also makes the cut but won't
see now as will the spotlight over to a
new invention from the Queen University
a new hollow flex smartphone it uses
peel the technology in order to provide
you some sort of 3d holographic saan the
display which provides depth in addition
to allowing you to interact with the
phone in different ways actually have to
fold it for certain gestures to work I'm
not really sure if this has a future but
it's always cool to see new technology
make the cut eventually this just gets
polished then we get it on the next
Samsung and for those of you that were
stoked about the whole smart connector
features that might reach some sort of
an iPhone pro that's being rumoured well
we've got some sources of credible
stature that claimed that apparently
those are not going to make the cut or
at least we're not sure we've heard
rumors that there is an iphone 7 other
rumors that there
an iphone pro than the plus apparently
one of these phones could get the
connector but we don't really know what
the connector is going to be for I
really doubt that Apple is planning to
make some sort of a detachable keyboard
for the iphone I mean Steve Jobs would
like totally roll in his grave there
have been cases of these keyboards being
built by third parties and Apple has
completely canceled support so stay
tuned and finally the hottest news that
I have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
Note six there is a lot of anticipation
over what we can expect from this phone
mainly because we're hearing monster
specifications on Weibo but now another
source is claiming that there will be a
light variant this light variant is
interesting because it has a Snapdragon
820 4 gigs of ram and pretty much
everything we already see on the galaxy
s7 which would still make it a great
phone and I feel that that's the way
that companies like HTC should have done
the lifestyle variant of the HTC 10 you
know not go through really low specs but
instead just grab last year
specifications but you're still great
the Snapdragon 810 is for example but it
leads me to the question of today would
you be okay with buying a light variant
that has the specs of the galaxy s7 or
would you just go all out with the more
powerful variant you know in my case the
biggest disappointment in my case with
the note 5 was mainly that the fact that
the phone became obsolete like really
quickly once the Galaxy s7 was launched
and it's the first time it ever happens
with a note I feel that Samsung should
have played the cards that it's being
rumoured to do with the note 6 but hey
if you don't want to pay so much money I
love the galaxy s soda and what it can
do so those specs on the next note what
also makes sense leave us a comment down
