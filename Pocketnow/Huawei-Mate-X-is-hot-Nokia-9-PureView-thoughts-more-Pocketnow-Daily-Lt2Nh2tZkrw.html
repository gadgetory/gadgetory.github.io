that thing is hot but the price tag is
not the Nokia 9p review was announced
and it turned out to be real no joke and
LG announced three new smartphones
including the 5g one here at MWC I'm
Jaime Rivera and definitely about us
alone that's a lot of work but it's our
favorite show for a reason
this is pocket out daily powered by
qualcomm the official news today begin
with product announcement starting with
Qualcomm definitely their press
conference is one of the most
interesting showing us their 5g roadmap
how very soon we will have a chipset
that includes a 5g modem all the
products that we'd be able to
interconnect the 5g and we definitely
had other carriers and partners showing
their plans for the future you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about Sony the company surprised us with
a very significant change we've got the
Xperia one in Xperia 10 we've got a full
hands-on video with all the details on
these phones definitely the most
interesting part is the fact that these
are not your typical Sony phones that
there is new leadership and even though
specifications weren't what I would call
stellar and the fact that I wasn't able
to actually test one of them I do find a
lot of promise in this design let us
know what you think in the comment now
let's talk about LG the company also
surprised this over Sunday with their
announcement not just that the LG G
eight thank you and some of the gimmicks
with the way the system works but
probably the most interesting part is
the LG be 55 G and the reason why is
because well 5 G's phones require more
antennas and this one is in the exact
same footprint of the be 40 that's all
great hopefully we will be getting this
phone very soon now probably one of my
favorite announcements today was
definitely the Nokia 9p review I
obviously knew about this for a while
ago I wanted to share this with you guys
and now we have it officially definitely
one of the most interesting approaches
to photography and this is something
that we've come to expect from Nokia the
old nokia nokia that's back showing us
that they can bring their camera Crouse
back you have a full hands-on video with
all the details on this product as well
you can learn more about it in the
description and finally the hottest news
today have to do with well the wall wave
mate X and the reason why we left it at
the hottest news is because I actually
have a video I prepared a video with my
reactions over the huawei mate X and the
reason why I decided not to share this
because I wanted to wait for the price
tag here I go to the event I participate
in everything and then they say that
that thing is going to cost two thousand
three hundred bucks I'm not saying that
the technology's not worth it or
anything it's just my god that is way
beyond the possibility of a lot of
people you can buy a ton of products for
that money but obviously this is my
opinion in today's question let us know
1 what do you think about the huawei
mate X I love the design I find that to
be one of the most genius foldable
designs out there but number 2 what do
you think about the price dude am I the
only one that thinks it's crazy leave us
a comment down below we love to know
your opinion by now you probably noticed
that the hottest phones of the year
bring significant camera and provements
but that you know that that's in part
because of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
mobile platform it includes the first
spec for a 380 computer vision image
signal processor meaning four times
faster ai and enables 50% less file
sizes thanks to hei F while capturing
more file information to create better
depth maps for portrait photos it also
enables 4k HDR video capture at 60
frames per second stuff got even the
camera that I'm using to film this video
can't perform follow the link in the
description below to learn more about
why the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 is so
cool
