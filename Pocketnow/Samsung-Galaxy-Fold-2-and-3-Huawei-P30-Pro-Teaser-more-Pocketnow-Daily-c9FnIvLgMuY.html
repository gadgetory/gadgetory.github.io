more foldable smartphones for the very
near future we get a new teaser from the
Huawei P 30 pro and it definitely
confirms some of the rumors and elbows
vice-president just spilled the beans
and gave us the specs of its upcoming
flagship I'm Jaime mater Iveta and no
wonder bears hibernate it's crazy cold
outside it's minus 13 degrees Celsius
this sparking out daily sponsored by
brave the official news today begin with
deals even though the one that we found
is probably going to end too early for
you but BMA just got a ton of them and
probably the coolest one is $500 off the
2017 macbook yeah that's a lot of money
and ends up being a crazy deal obviously
I hope you can find it on time but again
that's not the only one now it's all
about Apple this is a rather interesting
two-part story that tells us of the
changes in policies when it comes to
repairs that actually benefit you as in
the past if you would bring an iPhone
for repairs and you had a third-party
battery they wouldn't touch your product
now if you've got a third-party battery
or display they will they will repair it
and if they need to swap your whole
product that will actually just charge
you for the third-party products you
have but we also hear reports separately
that apparently Apple has also been
using third-party batteries which is
even more weird yeah this is good
actually now it's all about elbows vice
precedent and the feature of the company
we don't know when their next lecture
was coming but according to him we are
getting at Qualcomm Snapdragon a 55 with
a gigs of ram enough storage and battery
in that periscopic
camera that we saw MWC 2019 we don't
have any dates but hopefully this is
gonna be the find successor and let's
talk about Huawei as well the p30 Pro is
definitely something hot that we're
expecting
we've just got some teasers that show us
in video what to expect from the phone
at least this attentive blue actually
matches the leaks that we've seen in
renders so we're assuming that this is
going to be the flagship color for this
device and well we also hear that that
periscopic camera is coming to the p30
pro so man this is gonna get really good
and finally the hottest that I have to
do with Samsung and the company's plans
for fold
we hear that there are two other
foldables in the works that there is a
foldable that mimics pretty much that
motor razor concept that we heard about
and that there's also a device that will
fold outward just like we've seen with
the mate X which is great this is just
the compliment the galaxy folds in
today's question let us know I mean if
you had to pick which is the variance of
a foldable product that you would pick
this in my case honestly my favorite
would be something that would mimic the
razor I feel that that would be the most
usable I really don't need a tablet in
my pocket I would rather have a smaller
smartphone that could become a larger
one but that's just me leave us a
