not text and drive whatever it is it is
not so important than your life and if
it is so important please pull over send
the SMS and then get back on your way
remember texting and driving can get you
another skills so please do not do that
for all the other situations when you
would like to text and do something we
will show you a nice application which
is called transparent SMS check it out
first of all I'm not a fan of texting
and doing something else texting
requires your attention texting requires
at least one hand if not both of them
and it requires your attention and your
glance to be right on the screen doing
this will get you into trouble but for
all the other situations when you want
to send a text message to someone while
you're doing something listicle
application comes in handy and it's
called transparent SMS it basically
overlays the image of your camera onto
the screen and on top of it you will be
presented with a qwerty four quarts or
another keyboard of your choice we will
have a dedicated button called receiver
which would be the recipient and in this
case we will send Adam oh great we just
got an error let's recover from that
okay so we're back we selected Adam as
the recipient and we'll type a short
message which will say best thing the
keys are quite good our big my thumbs
are bit too and pushing this small
button here will send the text message
and then we turn to the screen so that
you can send another one now as far as
options are concerned this application
has quite a few you will be able to
select device orientation so in case you
are left to right handed
this will come in handy then you will
have a set of features yeah that's my
finger there and this is the main
problem with devices which had their
camera at the back and ninety-nine point
nine percent of the device is headed
here if you hold the device like you
normally would one way or the other you
will be covering the image so it's not
that useful if you want to use this
application with both hands I don't know
if you will be able to ever send the
text message with this application using
only one hand which again it's difficult
so maybe you can get used to it maybe
not getting back to the options you will
have several options to transform the
overlay of the camera you can either
rotate rendering by 90 degrees or you
can flip the image horizontally or
vertically I don't know why is this
useful but it's there you will have
another option to vibrate the device
while you are pressing the key which is
good it shows you when that certain key
press was registered and you have
several layouts for the keyboard which
is 40 you will have dessert tea for
French and there's quartz too but I
cannot find it here so this was a short
take on transparent SMS please again
remember do not text while driving thank
you very much hope to see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
