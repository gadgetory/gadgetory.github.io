at the blue booth here at CTIA in Las
Vegas having a look at their new
smartphone offerings if you haven't seen
the monster blue peer Excel we highly
suggest that you do but we also got to
spend some time with other cool
offerings I might never get on with
PocketNow here with a quick hands out of
the blue vivo air LTE if your budget is
currently limited to $200 well Blue has
just announced the very nifty package
for that particular price tag the new
blue vivo air LTE actually honors its
name with its spec package particularly
because well it's really thin at just
5.1 millimeters this device sports a
glass on glass design protected by
Gorilla Glass 3 that's also matched with
a very shiny aluminum trim on the sides
it feels extremely light in the hand
though the build does give it a premium
feel and for this price range even
though you really can't ask for much I
could say that I actually like what I
see and feel you get a four point eight
in 720p Super AMOLED panel at 306 pixels
per inch and some very nice viewing
angles again for this price tag under
the hood we have a 1.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 410 processor 2 gigs of ram
and 16 gigs of non-expandable storage
you also get an 8 megapixel primary
camera at the back match with a
5-megapixel selfie shooter at the front
there's also a non removable 20 50
milliamp hour battery that's set to be
able to give you as much as 11 hours of
talk time as its name implies well this
is an LTE capable device with fans that
should support AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile out of
the box
powering this device is Android 5.0
lollipop under a very light blue skin
that pretty much looks like stock
Android how it performs with those
specifications at this price range is
yet to be seen but blue is nice enough
to provide us with a review unit so stay
tuned as we report back on our
experience
we've got more coverage coming from CTI
in Las Vegas so make sure you follow us
