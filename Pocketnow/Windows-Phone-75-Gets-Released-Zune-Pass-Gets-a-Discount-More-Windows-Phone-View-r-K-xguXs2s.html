7.5 mango soon bath subscription updates
plan for october third and microsoft's
explanation on internet sharing
disappoints all this and more coming up
right now hello everyone I'm hi Mary
better with pocketnow.com and welcome to
Windows Phone view the show we wrap up
all this week's good and bad inside the
world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's start this week off with
what's good the big news are finally
here Microsoft has offered their windows
phone 7.5 mango update officially not
all devices have got it yet but
microsoft plans to roll this out in this
week or probably the next show make sure
you keep hitting the updates because it
will most probably hate your device soon
now another president that process
though is the fact that if you use our
video to get mangled beta unofficially
on your device well you can actually
update to the official release and it
actually cleans up all the previous beta
processes and updates to leaders of I
seamlessly updated to mango Adam line
did this says dell venue pro and i did
it to my dell venue pro 2 and they're
working well so kudos to microsoft we're
offering a really good way to update
your phone without all the hassle now
make sure you hit Adam lines full review
of Windows Phone 7.5 mango in case
you're interested on details on what you
can do and if you want to get a clean up
day to mango without actually going
through that beta update process well
hit aunt Tandy maggie's recent video on
how to update your device or should I
say bring back your device to know do to
get your clean update to mango and
finally Anton has also published a
detailed list of carriers and how
they're rolling the mango update to your
phone so make sure you hit the article
to see if your phones listed at pocket
now we must admit we're big fans of the
zune pass because while you just pay one
fee every month or a year and you get
all the music you can eat and well the
good news is that aside from the fact
that it's already working in Canada is
the fact that Microsoft is planning to
drop the price as of October third so it
was costing 50 bucks a month and now
it's going to cost you just ten bucks a
month and you can still think the same
board
vices and any combination it could be a
PC a zoom when those phones whatever you
want as long as there are only four
devices and other great news is the
Windows Phone in xylar application is
now offering free ringtones for those of
you that are interested and also is the
fact that you can now access the windows
phone marketplace from the web and not
just your windows phone so really good
updates for software out of the
smartphone announces for the week well
t-mobile has just made official that
they'll be adopting the HTC Radar as the
HTC radar 4g with really great specs
that you already know and love aside
from that Samsung is also announced
their omnia W and it's now available on
pre-order in Italy and well we all know
that's thousands of miles away so we can
expect it to be in our shores really
soon the Cybernet well even though this
is not a smartphone release the whatsapp
messenger application is finally
available in the marketplace and it's
available for free so if you want to
contact your iphone buddies android
buddies blackberry nokia whatever you
want the whatsapp messenger is now
available for you to download so make
sure you get it because it's free and
well out of this week's rumors very deep
within a mango application promotion
that Microsoft's offering currently we
find future mango phones being listed we
first of all get the Nokia see where we
already know about we get a Nokia saber
we get a samsung Wembley and a samsung
Yukon sadly we only get the names from
the moment no real specs or a clear idea
when we're getting these mango handsets
but it's really cool that we already got
four different names of new mango
handsets coming to from Nokia to from
Samsung new press shots have also been
revealed of LG's Jil Sander signature
Windows Phone and while we still don't
have dates on one that will be available
and we also have the ZT easy taenia
device so make sure you hit our website
for details on specs and whatever we
were able to dig out and last but not
least we finally get the samsung focuses
on camera and that's our camera by the
way and while we were hoping for the
device to look a lot like the samsung
galaxy s2 line but let me tell you the
device looks even better so make sure
you hit our website for details on what
we can expect for the device and
hopefully a date
alright so that does it for what's good
let's continue on with what's bad
Microsoft has already pointed out that
the old current generation of windows
phone handsets that were not released
with mango initially are not getting
internet sharing really sad news because
there was a debate actually Microsoft
came on record stating that the devices
were not capable because the radios
would not allow for internet sharing to
happen and then comes Joe Belfiore on
record to state no the devices are
capable of doing it as long as well the
manufacturers are out there and
considering the fact that they would
need to offer new drivers for the radios
but the devices are capable so sadly it
seems that our current generation
devices are not getting internet sharing
really sad news for Microsoft because I
really hate the fact that well it's only
been a year ever since we've gotten
these windows phones and now Microsoft
is figuring out ways to get us to
purchase new devices instead of honoring
the old devices in the current Windows
Phone strategy of allowing you to have a
delightful device and not having to
upgrade every year when you get to your
contracts sad news for that and well
another sad news Microsoft is now
mentioning that they'll allow the
quality of handsets to be lowered for
the next generation devices to be
released in their current Japanese
conference now what we mean by lowering
the quality is the fact that they're
lowering the bar what specifications
need to be brought for devices so give
you an example in the past that was
required that the devices would not have
anything less than a 5 megapixel camera
and the new standards will allow as
little as a 3 megapixel camera other
points have it that microsoft was
requiring devices to have at least a
gigabytes of storage and now they're
requiring the devices have a minimum of
2 gigabytes now if you remember the fact
that most devices currently don't have
hot swappable microsd cards this is
really bad news so we're not really sure
of Microsoft's doing this to prepare for
the tango release of hopefully cheaper
devices just for the entry-level markets
but sadly let's hope that this does not
mean that manufacturers will start
lowering the quality of devices and
keeping the same price
in order to get some more revenues sad
news that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching and hey if
you're interested in working for
pocketnow.com and filming some really
great quality videos we're currently
hiring so make sure you send us your
resume at jobs at pocketnow.com in case
