packing.com and today would shoot a
pretty powerful weather program this is
called weatherbug and you can find us on
windows mobile marketplace and the lite
version is actually free and the only
difference between it and the regular
version that you pay for is one dollar
ninety-nine cents but the lite version
is adware so it will have an advertising
up here at the top so the first thing
we're going to is our current condition
so right now we have 46 degrees
fahrenheit in Seattle so if I click this
arrow right here it will give me a
breakdown of what the current weather is
as you see we have the current
temperature wind chill factor highs and
lows dew point humidity pressure rain
wind pretty much anything that you can
think of weather-wise is right here so
you go back to the main screen and if
there were any serious weather alerts
they would just be displayed right here
and if I click this arrow of course
there are no weather alerts right now so
going to scroll back it'll show us our
Wednesday forecast so partly sunny a
chance of showers this afternoon so we
can click here and get a greater
breakdown of the week to come and it
gives us a seven day forecast and if I
click over here it will give us a more
precise breakdown of the highs and lows
and one more click to this side and it
will actually give us an hourly
breakdown for that entire day so as you
see Wednesday at 12pm and then 1pm and
2pm and 3pm and so forth and so on we
can also get a map view by clicking here
and consumed in zoom out as you see I
can change the transparency so if I
wanted to be more transparent I can do
it a 40-percent and it will load this is
the satellite view and we can change the
layers on this particular program to
temperature or radar so if i want to
change it to temperature click there and
it will give us a little bit of a
temperature gauge at the top as well as
what the current temperatures in the
area are another cool feature about this
program is it will give us local
snapshots from weather cameras and
various other
public cameras around the area so right
now we have Kings west seattle i believe
that's probably a street load another
image here holy family school so as you
see we can see the clouds of course
there's many clouds on Seattle and we
can click next to another picture and
then mouths I and a little bit of fog up
there partly cloudy go to the next photo
and first create middle school and it's
very clear right here so you can go to
some of the settings so we can add
English or metric and same with our
Yuwen units will click done and we can
change our theme so if we wanted to have
the blue theme just click there and
click done and now we have the blue team
great so it's a little more appealing
than the silver theme so this is another
marketplace pick and this program is
called weatherbug and there are two
versions available there's a lite
version which is free and it does have
an advertisement at the top or there is
the paid version which is one dollar
ninety-nine cents on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
