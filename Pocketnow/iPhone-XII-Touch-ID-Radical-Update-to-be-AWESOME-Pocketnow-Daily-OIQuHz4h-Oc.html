could be making a big comeback in 2020
iPhones I have some interesting color
variants for both the Galaxy Note 10 and
the 5g variant of the galaxy s 10 is now
available on Verizon for a hefty price
tag I'm Jaime Rivera and this episode of
daily is brought to you by the fast and
smooth one +7 Pro which is now available
starting at just 669 follow the link in
the description to learn more and get
yours
this is pocket out daily the official
nor should I begin with deals my god
gift that keeps on givin B and H now has
the entry-level 12-inch MacBook which is
nothing but entry-level for the price
tag for up to four hundred dollars off
and yes we know there are some new
variants that have just been announced
by Apple silently so yeah this is not
necessarily the latest variants but
again 400 bucks off is not necessarily
bad even if that's not our favorite
computer now let's talk about Huawei and
the launch of the mate 20x and their 5 g
variant it was just announced today
apparently it'll come to the United
States in July not exactly sure how
that's gonna happen but it brings the
karin 980 that belong five thousand five
g chip and apparently the price tag
begins at $9.99 pounds in the UK which i
wonder what that's gonna be in the
united states if that does launcher
we'll keep you posted
and speaking of 5 g variants samsung has
just announced along with verizon the
galaxy s 10 5g i cannot wait to get a
unit to tell you more about it I just
wonder if I'm gonna be able to test 5g
here in New York case or maybe that the
price tag is $12.99 for the 256 gigabyte
variant and yes this is a very powerful
no holds barred Galaxy S 10 regardless
of the 5g or the nine 5g connectivity
just for the storage and the added time
of flight cameras it's actually a quite
compelling product on its own in
addition to the fact that it's a larger
phone and yeah you could get it pretty
much today
and speaking of Samsung galaxys we got
new leaks for the Galaxy Note line up
apparently even though we're gonna have
the standard colours for you know silver
white and black for the galaxy notes
apparently there will be some other
special colors like red and certain
regions and then there's going to be a
pain
variant as well because you have large
phones are kind of the thing also for
women so that's also going to be an
option but we hear that there might be
other colors that are gonna be region
specific I hope the red does long to the
United States but the I stay tuned
apparently that's going to be in the
fall and even the 5g variants of the
note will share these colors but have
some variants like a special tone of
stroke Silver's what I heard
and finally the hottest dishes that I
have to do with iPhones and the possible
return of touch ID the face ID is great
there's nothing wrong with it but
apparently Apple has other plans they
also want to have a sort of two-step
biometric authentication where you have
your face and you also have your
fingerprints in addition for you to be
able to use your phone as your passport
wallet and other requirements that
apparently certain security agencies are
looking for think about it is you're
gonna be able to unlock your phone
pretty much anywhere on the display
according to the rumors there are some
special pinhole cameras on the display
as well which is rather interesting let
us know in the comments down below what
do you think do you like this idea or
not I do like the concept of having my
phone be my passport particularly
because yes it can fully authenticate me
better than any document that I'm
carrying but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we love tell me your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news early or follow us on packing
