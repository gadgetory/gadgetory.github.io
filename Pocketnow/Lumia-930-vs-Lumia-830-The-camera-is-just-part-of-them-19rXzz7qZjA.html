Phones was not about specifications as
many entry-level Lumias performed like
champions back then the question is if
those times still exist today I'm hi
Mary vet of a pocket now and let's see
if you should buy the Lumia 830 or the
Lumia 930 I think it's safe to say that
there is no such thing as an ugly lumia
in the market regardless if you buy the
top-of-the-line model or the entry-level
device books are guaranteed and that can
be said about both the lumia 930 and the
Lumia 830 from the front and the side it
is really hard to tell these devices
apart as both models port well machined
aluminum trims combined with a
polycarbonate back that feels great in
the hand the differences really start
when digging through dimensions as the
Lumia 930 is one millimeter wider almost
1 millimeter thicker and the crazy 17
grams heavier than the Lumia 830 even if
the later is a two and a half
millimeters taller both devices do
support the same 5-inch display
measurements but the Lumia 930 sports a
much better 1080p AMOLED panel when
compared to the 720p IPS LCD of the 830
that can sometimes seem washed out if
you look at it from the left side the
spec sheet is another clear disparity
between the higher-end Lumia 930 and
Lumia 830 which is lowered to your phone
but I'm 30
clearly beats the pants off the 830 in
the processor the RAM the battery the
cameras and the built-in storage the
only advantages with the 830 is that you
do have expandable storage up to 128
gigabytes your battery is replaceable
you can easily replace the back covers
and even better if you get the AT&amp;amp;T
Lumia 830 it brings the LTE bands at
neither the unlock to Lumia 930 or the
Lumia icon from Verizon bring
clearly one of these devices was
designed to entice a more demanding
crowd than the other and well both their
numerical designators and the price tags
confirm that now since this is Windows
Phone we could assume that just like in
the past we shouldn't worry about the
software part since both these devices
run Lumia denim right well that's really
not accurate as we discussed with our
Lumia 930 after the buzz getting the
full power of Lumia denim is sadly a
benefit that is only available to the
models that bring the Snapdragon 800
processor and well that's the case of
the Lumia 930 we highly recommend that
you watch the after the bus for more
details the Lumia 830 does get some of
these features like for example like
folders Cortana and well that's pretty
much it so far oddly the new Lumia
camera with the whole rich capturing
moments features that we loved on the
930 in our previous video are oddly not
working on this 8:30 review unit and
neither on the other review unit that
Michael has and we don't know why all we
know is that we're currently stuck on
the old Nokia camera application and
you're not getting the full Lumia denim
features that being said once the
software update comes and the Lumia
camera starts working you have to keep
in mind that the 830 will not be able to
give you the 4k video recording that you
get on the 930 because of the difference
in megapixel count another feature
you're not getting in the Lumia 830 is
the ability to summon Cortana with your
voice something that we've become very
fond of with the Lumia 930 the only real
benefit that you're getting with the
Lumia 830 over the 930 is that the
glance mode does work on the 830
something odd since we thought this was
actually an AMOLED feature and it turns
out that this IPS display on the 830 is
the only one capable of bringing it at
this time
once you test the software with the
hardware powering it you will notice
that the old days of the fluid Windows
Phone over lower end hardware have ended
you'll notice that the 830 drops a
couple of frames here and there with the
excessive Windows Phone animations and
where the 930 doesn't stutter at all
when playing graphics intensive games
you won't notice much of a difference
between both these devices but that's
once the game is running it'll take a
lot more time for the eight-thirty to
run the game than the 930
we tested phone calls and network
performance on both Lumias over the AT&amp;amp;T
network and our recent trip to CES in
Las Vegas and even though you will have
a hard time telling the difference
between them in call quality the LTE
bands on Lumia 830 left the 930 eating
dirt we will have more thoughts on the
battery performance and the network
performance in our full Lumia 830 review
coming very soon but you can learn more
about the Lumia 930 S battery in our
recent after the buzz the comparison
you're waiting for most is really in the
cameras and the boy was this a tough one
see the Lumia 930 has all the software
features that the 830 still doesn't have
with a Lumia rich capture and moments
but neither camera is really a slouch if
it weren't for the megapixel differences
you really can't complain about the
photo quality on either of these devices
colours pop on both cameras and even
video recording is extremely similar on
both of them it's really hard to tell
them apart if all you want us to buy a
Lumia for a great camera you will be
suited with either device and optics and
when it comes to software the Lumia 930
will have a couple more denim features
but that doesn't mean that the camera on
the 830 is bad on the contrary it is
really good overall it's really hard to
declare a winner when it comes to both
of these devices and that's mainly
because they were created with different
users and different price points in mind
what I will tell you is that I'm highly
impressed with the features you're
getting with the less expensive Lumia
830 it is definitely worth the money I
want the neither the Lumia 930 is still
my favorite smartphone camera hands-down
no
for comparison but it doesn't mean that
I wouldn't mind trusting my moments the
Lumia 830 either if I was on the go it
really all depends on your needs in your
budget
since both devices bring out the best of
Windows Phone for the respective markets
and users they were designed for we've
got a lot more coverage on the Lumia 830
coming very soon so make sure you follow
