pocketnow.com today we're going to take
an outside tour of the verizon samsung
omnia i 9 to clarify what i said in the
unboxing video regarding the i nine tens
ppi or pixels per square inch the ppi
for the i nine ten is 146 it is less
than a ppi of 163 for the iphone as i
use the device will have to see if it
really makes any difference ok let's
start the tour we've got that 3.2 inch
240 x 400 screen right above it we've
got the speaker you will notice that
unlike the i 900 there's no vga camera
on the front of the i nine ten on the
bottom of the device we've got the call
button on the left and the M button on
the right the mechanical d-pad is
replaced by an optical mouse which has
an embedded button there are also no
windows mobile soft key buttons we'll
have to see how well that works on the
left side of the device we have a hook
to attach a lanyard or the stylus
attaching the stylist here makes a
device a little unwieldy you know even
though the stylus is sturdy and it's
telescoping it's too bad Samsung
couldn't figure out a way to incorporate
the stylus in the device but after all
this is supposed to be a touch device
and so you should need a stylist on the
bottom of the left hand side you've got
to cover which exposes the Samsung
proprietary connector for your USB cable
your headset and your FM adapter so I on
the right hand side you've got the
camera button at the bottom then a
rocker switch for volume up and down
and then at the top you've got the
samsung main menu button which brings up
a finger friendly application menu I'm
assuming that this button can also be
remapped to other uses on the bottom
you've got the microphone button on the
top you've got the power standby button
and right next to it I the reset button
which you have to use the stylus for
okay let's take a look at the back of
the device we have a 5 megapixel camera
with zoom and autofocus next to it is
the flash this is a high-end camera
rivaling any basic point shoot next to
the camera we've got a speaker and now
let's take a look under the back cover
we've got a 1440 milliamp battery and
then next to that is a microSD slot
which can hold up to a 16 gigabyte
microSD along with the internal light
gigabytes of storage 256 megabytes a
flash and 128 megabytes of RAM you
should have plenty of storage for
anything that comes up let's try to
place the cover back on this is always a
little tricky to get the cover on over
the camera lens one thing I find strange
on the back is this sticker at the
bottom it says for best performance do
not touch this area when using your
phone this is where the antennas are I
have to say I have a tough time using
this phone without touching that area so
that's really too bad that is it for the
hardware tour and I'll be back with a
look at the included software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
