PocketNow comm and today we're looking
at IMDb mobile now if you enjoy watching
movies then you've probably heard of
imdb.com
it's a largest online database for movie
and TV show related information you can
look up ratings trivia and actors
filmography view trailers and so on it's
really a giant online playground for
movie fanatics so with that in mind it's
good to finally see an IMDB app and
development for Windows Mobile it comes
to us by way of xda-developers
and although it's still in beta it
already has plenty of cool features
let's see what it has to offer as you
can see the main menu has a search bar
up top followed by quick jump still
IMDb's top 250 and films that are due to
hit theaters soon let's go ahead and do
a search I'm going to type in Avatar hit
the search button
ok return results quite quickly with
thumbnails for the movies lagging
slightly behind looks like we have
movies TV shows actors even videogames
let's go back and hit the movie we were
looking for alright pretty basic
information we have the title release
here of course the rating director
writer and plot if you click view more
details and here we have the genre
runtime specific release date tagline
and a little movie poster say you wanted
to see who's in the movie you can
actually go to cast ok nice list of the
actors and the roles that they play if
you wait long enough the thumbnails will
show up let's go ahead and click on an
actor ok so it shows a little head shot
and a biography if you click view you
can view the actress filmography and
trivia let's go back and actually check
out the trivia for the movie right so in
stinkin tidbits of the movie if you
click on it it'll expand let's go back
quotes and goofs have pretty much the
same layout as trivia so I'm going to
skip that and go to photos nice we get
some images of the movie and cast
members
unfortunately the images are a little
distorted I'm sure that'll get fixed
soon let's get out of here and my
favorite feature is being able to watch
a preview of the movie depending which
connection you're on edge or 3G you just
click and it should load the preview up
in your favorite media player this can
be assigned in the settings of the app I
have core player so it loads it up in
that
so that's pretty cool
I think you get the picture let's get
out of here
okay we're back at the main menu this
time let's click top 250 and it should
show us a list of the top movies
according to IMDB right so we have the
movie titles thumbnails ratings and the
amount of votes so let's go back and
check out movies that I do to hit
theaters soon of course you can click on
any of these let's get out of here
so IMDB Mobile is still in beta you'll
likely find some bugs and an incomplete
feature list but it already has many
features that any movie fan can
appreciate we're excited to see an app
like this finally hit Windows Mobile and
we'll be sure to keep an eye on its
progress I'll post a link for the beta
on pocketnow.com that's it for now
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
