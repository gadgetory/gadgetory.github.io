pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to talk about the email experience
on Windows Phone 7 and compare it to
Android and to the iPhone let's get
started now before continuing it's
important to mention that the Windows
Phone 7 hardware and software you're
about to see is not final it is not a
representation of what you're going to
be able to get when devices start
shipping in quarter 4 we're doing this
for fun so you can get an idea of how
the experience is today so let's talk
about email on all three devices I have
my Microsoft Exchange account being
synchronized so that all emails across
all three devices are the same and even
the read and unread states are
synchronized now what's really important
for email on a mobile device is triage
you want to be able to quickly and
easily multi select items mark them as
unread don't need a couple action on a
few so that when you get back to your
desktop or your main screen you have
pretty much eliminated off the clutter
and you get down to the things that you
need a big screen for okay so let's talk
about how these three devices handle
email triage so on Android depending on
which Android device you're using
you get checkboxes on the Left which
conveniently allow you to check them and
action on multiple emails and we've
three options mark is unread add star or
delete I'm going to mark them as unread
and then I have to go back and actually
uncheck them now in Windows Phone 7 it's
very similar and it works quite well in
fact there's a twist that is I think
better what you can actually do is tap
to the left of the message and the check
boxes automatically come up and from
here you can actually do more than just
mark as read or unread or delete or add
start you can set flag you can complete
it you can clear the flag
you can move it and delete it so from
here I'm going to mark as unread and
they are as marked as unread although
it's kind of hard to tell sometimes
which messages are our read marked as
read and marked as unread in this
version of Windows Phone 7 and over here
on the iPhone there's no way to multi
select to get the mark as unread to show
up so we can go to edit and then we can
multi-select but we can only delete and
move that's it if you want to go into an
email and
market as unread you have to actually go
into the email select it and come back
out and do that for every email that you
want to mark as unread so Windows Phone
7 has a great way to manage multiple
emails as does Android so let's talk
about the display of email in iPhone you
can choose to have an email preview if
you'd like and so we have the name of
the sender plus the subject and the time
but you can also pull in the first two
lines of the email Windows Phone 7 you
don't get a choice but by default the
way it comes out of the box is you get
the name of the sender the subject and
the first sentence and the time which is
good enough and over here in Android
depending on the Android device you're
using it's much like the iPhone how I
have it displayed over here with the
sender the subject the time and you can
also star or unstart certain items now
in Windows Phone 7 there are multiple
views for your messages you can swipe to
the right to get only your unread
messages swipe to the right again for
flagged urgent and back to off can't do
that on iPhone or Android so a really
great way to organize your email now
let's talk about how emails actually
display HTML emails so here we have a
CompUSA newsletter yes CompUSA still
exists sort of and we can pull it up on
both devices it displays very nicely in
the iPhone very nicely here on Android
although it's not as scaled back and
perhaps move that around side scroll on
Windows Phone 7 for some reason this
bill does not support HTML email which
is a big problem because there's a lot
of email that I think most people get
that is HTML these days so no HTML email
support in this version of Windows Phone
7 that is not to say that when it ships
it will be missing as well
so let's go back here back and back now
let's talk about creating a new email
message which is obviously another
important component of an email program
on a mobile device so down here for each
iPhone we tap on the new message button
here we press the plus and over here we
go in to compose okay very similar
workflows on all those devices I'm going
to type my name and we're gonna see how
fast it looks into the contact database
to pull out my name if I can spell
my name right okay very fast on the
iPhone very fast on Windows Phone 7 and
I expect that here on Android 2.2 it'll
be just as fast and it is now from here
we can do a few different things on all
of these devices on the iPhone you
really have only two choices you can
cancel and it allow you to save it as a
draft or delete the draft or you can
send it to options Windows Phone 7 you
have a lot more options if I tap here to
open the application tray I can change
the priority add add a blind carbon copy
or carbon copy receiver or I can
actually attach a picture which is quite
nice I don't see any way to attach a
file which would be great on the iPhone
of course if you want to email picture
you have to start in the photo gallery
and then go into the email application
so let's say I want to email this
picture here it's attached boom
instantly and in Android you can also
attach a picture so you click add
attachment you go into the gallery you
can actually go into the file browser in
that case and I don't have any pictures
here to attach so also in here in
Windows Phone 7 if you press the close
button it asks you do you want to save
it as a draft cancel or save the message
and here in in in Android if you want to
save it as a draft you click this button
here you click save as draft it's an
extra step and then it goes into your
drafts folder so let's go back to the
Inbox views of all of these different
all these different email applications
now something that is kind of a drag is
that in this version of Windows Phone 7
there's no way to view a unified inbox
which I think a lot of people will be
disappointed about but once again this
is beta software it's possible that when
Windows Phone 7 comes out they will have
the unified inbox feature Android 2.2
and iPhone 4 or os 4 do do unified inbox
quite well by now so obviously email is
a critical function of any smartphone
and so far Windows Phone 7 seems to be
on the right track
it allows you to triage email very
efficiently by allowing you to multi
select and act on many emails at a time
with a lot of different methods it
allows you to quickly filter out between
unread messages so your
wasting time digging through your list
of read and unread trying to find your
unread and it also is fast it has this
fluid Metro interface that is a
refreshing deviation of what you get
from some of the heavier email clients
and yes it does work in landscape
although strangely when you tap the the
ass the tray over here it takes up so
much of the screen there are some
weaknesses like lack of unified inbox
and lack of HTML support but again this
is not final software we have to reserve
judgment until we see a shipping device
of Windows Phone 7 in this fall so hope
you enjoyed this video if you liked it
