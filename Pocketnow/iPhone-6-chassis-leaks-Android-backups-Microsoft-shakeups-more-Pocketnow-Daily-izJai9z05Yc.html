tipped as more leak part to merge Google
is experimenting with Android backups in
a serious way and as Satya Nadella up to
yet another dramatic change in Microsoft
I'm hi Mary that I and let's get through
this quick as there is a happy hour at
6pm and you guys know what that means
this is pocket out daily let's begin
today with what's official though even
though these news are cool they're kind
of mixed as you remember that at Google
i/o it was announced the chromecast
would be allowed for you to stream and
mirror your display from your Android
tablet or smartphone to your TV that
functionality is available as of today
you can simply download the application
and update it and you can now have this
feature even works what sound and it's
really cool have you got a Nexus device
it's part of your application and
settings tray which is great the problem
is that it doesn't work on every product
right now is this still in beta so we do
description for the full list of
products that are supported and other
official news let's talk about LG as the
company has just made some of their new
g pad tablets available in the United
States starting with the seven inches
and 10.1 inch tablets but even though
these tablets are not as compelling when
it comes to specification so my god the
price tags are just crazy 150 bucks for
the 7-inch tablet and then 250 bucks for
the 10.1 inch tablet that's probably
never been before seen for 10 inch
tablet particularly and yeah again the
specs are not great but LD tablets are
actually quite cool it would be good for
you to have a look they're available in
almost every retailer right now now in
some very interesting rumors probably
one of the most annoying things about
Android is having to migrate from one
phone to the other as backup and restore
features are actually white archaic when
compared to features like iCloud or
other services you get in Windows Phone
so apparently Android is going to evolve
Google is working on a new project where
they plan to make backup restore
features more interesting more practical
and apparently very easy to do between
devices regardless of what brand you
have which is great to see no timing on
that but hopefully very soon now I've
got two very interesting rumors of the
iphone 6 starting with the
that Apple is apparently investing on a
more expensive vibrating motor for
enhanced haptic feedback the company has
been reluctant to adopt this technology
ever since the launch of the iphone and
we've been using half the feedback ever
since windows mobile and probably no get
the vices previously so apparently Apple
has figured out a new way to get that
done but even more interesting is that
we've got some leaked backs of the
iphone 6 and apparently these are
already machined it almost ready for
final production and as it turns out
that carved apple logo at the back
apparently is for the NFC antenna
another technology that Apple has been
reluctant to a dot so let's see how that
goes and finally for the very
interesting and revealing news of the
day Satya Nadella recently addressed his
employees and aside from a statement
that he also provided to them he
apparently wants to change everything
that Steve Ballmer just started recently
Steve Ballmer wanted to turn Microsoft
into a products and services company and
after that we've got the Microsoft
Surface the acquisition nokia lumia
devices etc and no nadella wants to turn
Microsoft into a productivity and
platform company something that sounds
boring just to mention it so it's really
hard to tell exactly what that means
into the Microsoft future I mean as the
company going to continue building
products or is that going to be a
separate business that Microsoft is
going to have but that Lisa's a question
of the day what is your top of mind of
Microsoft lately do you like the
products that they build or do you think
that they're boring or do you think they
are too focused on enterprise and I
particular case that's really my problem
i feel that Microsoft is all ready to
focus on enterprise without that new
vision so I really don't know what to
expect from the future believe it's a
comment down below what do you think
friends es you know the drill if you
want to get the dozer Lee ER before this
video is filming sure you follow us on
