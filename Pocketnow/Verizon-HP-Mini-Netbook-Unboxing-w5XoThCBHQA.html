pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
of the HP Mini 1151 NR that comes from
Verizon Wireless it actually has a
built-in EVDO modem with Rev a which
means that you can get high-speed
Internet access no matter where you are
so if you're not near Wi-Fi hotspot if
you're in the back of a taxicab you can
take out the netbook and use Verizon's
high-speed data network now we're gonna
test exactly how fast it is on this
netbook how fast the download speed is
how fast the upload speed is we're also
going to compare this device to the red
fly c8n which will help to answer the
question should you get a red fly or
should you just get a netbook right now
this is $199 subsidized on Verizon's
network if you buy from Amazon or from
HP it's gonna be twice as much $400
which actually makes it economical if
you were going to buy a netbook anyway
and then get a tether dongle from
Verizon Wireless for data it makes more
sense to go with the subsidized version
than to buy it right from the store
because you saved $200 so it does make
sense in that respect let's take a look
at the specifications of the 11:51 and
are let me zoom in a little bit it's
running the intel atom n270 processor
1.6 gigahertz with Windows XP home
although we can't help but wait for
Windows 7 to run on netbooks apparently
it runs beautifully it's got a 10.1 inch
screen it's running on one gigabyte of
RAM and 80 gigabytes of storage space so
let's take a look inside the box
and see what we have Wow very nice set
up instructions and kind of talks about
turning it on which we know how to do
inserting the battery running Windows XP
all right and here is the netbook and
naturally being a netbook it is very
small and we'll take a look at that in a
second so what we have in the accessory
department compartment here we have that
three cell battery
we've got a power cord of course and the
other side of the power cord and that
looks to be it what we got have some
more stuff in here actually some
software finally some verizon branding
some tips and shortcuts on activating
the video most likely a cleaning cloth
very nice one keep it clean and some
some other literature that looks like a
blank pad of paper that's interesting
we've got a user manual here one of the
best things about the HP Mini netbooks
is the keyboard they have very spacious
keyboards that are super easy to type on
it's got a nice design here it's got the
the HP swirly pattern I don't know if
you can see that nice shiny coat it's
quite lightweight because the batteries
not in so let's put the battery in and
it looks like it snaps in this way there
we go and lock it alright let's open it
up Wow keyboard goes from side to side
no space is wasted it's gonna be kind of
weird getting used to the the mouse
buttons being off to the left and to the
right looks like there's a nice scroll
mechanism here and of course you can
turn off the the the touchpad if you
have an external mouse it's got a nice
screen very glossy now you can see me
there and webcam built-in very nice so
we're gonna follow up with a lot of
tests on speed and the battery life and
how the whole EVDO integration works
then we're gonna take a look at how this
device compares with the red fly
experience coming up soon so that's
pretty much it for the Verizon Wireless
netbook never thought a carrier would
actually come out with a netbook but
look what happened so we'll be back with
more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
