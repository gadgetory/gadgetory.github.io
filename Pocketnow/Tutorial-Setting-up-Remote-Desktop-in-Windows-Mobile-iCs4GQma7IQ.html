pocketnow.com in Windows Mobile you can
use remote desktop to actually connect
to your home computer or your laptop or
any computer that's connected and set up
properly
so that you can control your computer
remotely whether you want to control
media playback or you want to access a
file or you want to check your email or
anything like that
the procedure is several steps long
which is why we made this tutorial video
showing you how to go about setting up
remote desktop the first thing that we
need to do is go to our computer and
change some settings in the router so
that we can connect to the computer now
if you do not have Remote Desktop built
into your device I'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get to it
although a lot of devices now come with
remote desktop so so you should have it
now if you are over a router you will
have to set up port forwarding and it's
a multi-step process but it's pretty
easy and I'm going to show you how to do
that now the first thing you want to do
is find out what your local IP addresses
and the way that you can do that is
quite simply by going to start and if
you are on Vista you just type CMD or if
you are on XP you go to run and you type
CMD and here we will get the kind of das
style pop up box you're going to want to
type ipconfig right now and press enter
and what you're going to get if you
scroll up a little bit is your IP for
address which is your local IP address
so here I am 192 dot 168 net 1.5 and you
just want to remember that last number
the dot 5 so you close that and then you
go into your web browser and then you
type the IP address of your router which
is pretty much always one ninety two dot
one sixty eight dot one dot one and once
logged in you want to go to the left
side of the screen here where it says
port forwarding of course this is for a
Netgear router but if you use Linksys or
d-link it's going to look some somewhat
the same look for where it says port
forwarding if you need if you need help
getting into your router if you don't
know the user may
name and password just Google for the
default username and password for your
particular router usually the username
is admin and the password is password
unless you've changed it so here we are
in port forwarding and I want to add a
new service for remote desktop so I'm
going to click add service I'm going to
put the server IP address as my local IP
address so it's 192 dot 168 that 1.5
we're going to call this remote desktop
and the starting port will be 3 3 8 9
and the ending port will also be 3 3 8 9
and you are all set with the port ready
to be forwarded so that you can use
remote desktop so now we're ready to go
back to the device alright and it's time
to test it out see if it works so what
you need to do now is enter where it
says computer you put your IP address if
you don't know your IP address just go
to what is my IP address com it's a
several digits long and you just type it
right into the box so I'm going to type
my IP address and see it work now there
is a setting that you want to use that I
found to be the most effective you go
into options here 256 colors allows the
the connection to work the quickest you
want to go to fullscreen and you want to
have a remote desktop fit to screen so
it's actually going to scale your
desktop down to the size of your mobile
device so in the case of the Touch HD we
get an 800 by 480 resolution or if you
have VGA device like the touch pro it'll
go to 480 by 640 and over in resources
you can mute the sound on your desktop
computer or you can actually have it
come through the device and you can hear
audio right on your mobile device ok so
here we are connected to my home
computer and it works just as if you
were sitting right there the visuals
aren't very pretty but that's because we
have the color scaled down so it works a
little faster so we can go in to start
we can launch programs as if we were
sitting right in front of our computer
use word we can open up files read files
so pretty cool and actually pretty full
functionality which is kind of
surprising considering that you know
you're using this over your mobile
device so that is the tutorial on how to
get remote desktop working in Windows
Mobile it's a great feature to have and
it's great to have it set up so that if
you need it one day you have it again
I'll post links on pocketnow.com on how
to get remotes desk
the program if you can't find it on your
device as it came from the factory so
that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
