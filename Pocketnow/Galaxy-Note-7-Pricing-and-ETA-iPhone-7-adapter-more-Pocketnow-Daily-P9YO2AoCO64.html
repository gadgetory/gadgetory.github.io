ETA and even two new renders newly show
is the very sketchy proof that the
iphone 7 is killing the headphone jack
and microsoft seems to continue on its
plan to downsize itself I'm hi Mary that
I and the this is actually one of those
fridays that I do not want to end so
I'll just make it longer you know how
this is parking out daily the official
nukes today begin with deals those of
you in the market for the google nexus
6p right now it's a hundred dollars off
if you're looking for the 64 gig variant
or the 128 variant if you follow the
link in the description but to swing the
pot even better you get a Garmin vivofit
smart band as well that's actually
rather cool other very interesting deals
have to do with the Moto 360
second-generation right now the black
variant is currently available for one
hundred and fifty dollars or 165
depending on the size no I did not get
the price tag wrong but obviously there
is a catch these are refurb units but
the thing is that if you notice within
the selection and daily steals you can
actually get warranty for thirty dollars
or forty dollars and you get two or
three years of warranty services so
that's that's a crazy price tag for the
product I wouldn't even think about it
now in the negative portion of new sadly
Microsoft has just announced that it's
downsizing it's not going to end the
company has pretty much let go of 1800
people this year and now it's announcing
the 2800 people will also be let go
throughout 2017 the company continues to
become more efficient yada yada yet I
hate that jargon where they're trying to
explain to you why people are losing
their jobs but that sadly is the case
i'll talk about apple we have been
skeptical over if the iphone 7 is going
to have a headphone jack or not but some
reason league show is a very sketchy
adapter that looks like if it were made
by apple but then when you look at the
Lightning port tip it definitely looks
slanted it doesn't look like something
that will come out of an apple assembly
line Foxconn sorry Foxconn we know that
Apple doesn't manufacture anything but
yeah it seems that that is going to be
the case probably this is just the
prototype but it just proves that that
is going to be the case indeed and
finally the very hot news today let's
call
hod to a certain degree let's talk about
the galaxy note 7 we've got three very
interesting leaks number one rendered
images that show us what to expect it
even includes the gear VR number two the
price tag apparently eight hundred and
fifty dollars early September the
possible launch date the problem and the
reason why we're skeptical is because
the leaks show is that this is pretty
much a galaxy s7 edge and just about
everything only a smaller battery USB
type-c and obviously the S Pen so yeah
it seems that those rumors of the
Snapdragon e23 are not going to happen
apparently there is only one variant
that's going to have the edges so it
leads me to the question of the day I
mean if you're being told that you're
getting the galaxy note 7 and it's
pretty much the galaxy s7 edge are you
really going to go for this phone or
just go for the s7 edge in my case
obviously i'm going to review it and
that is going to be the biggest question
that we're going to answer in our review
period friends you know the way it goes
