jog dial if that spec sheet doesn't get
your flag wavin you're too young to be
watching this I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our throwback
review of the Motorola Q the summer of
2006 in America telegin Nights was top
of the box office
Nickelback battled hinder for but rock
supremacy and your host for this video
was busily growing the weirdest mustache
in the history of Virginia Beach but
more importantly a hotly anticipated
mobile phone was hitting the market a
device poised to challenge then
incumbent rims blackberry family in the
qwerty space a new windows mobile device
unlike any other that smartphones named
the Motorola Q the Q was Motorola's
attempt to port the design aesthetic of
the wildly successful original razor to
a smartphone and it was a brilliant
success at eleven point nine millimeters
thick the Q is a little chunky by
today's standards but for the time it
was impossibly thin and even by today's
metrics it's very very light at 115
grams when I first saw one in the wild
it was being slid into a back pocket I
imagined trying to do the same with some
of its contemporaries and laughed a lot
while the slick looks and lightweight
served it well the Q wasn't without its
limitations Windows Mobile 5 for
smartphones was a powerful platform but
it didn't always run snappily on the Q's
processor a 312 megahertz intel xscale
also the tiny 1130 milliamp hour battery
didn't offer the best endurance and the
non touch display while bright and sharp
for the day was also pretty small at 2.4
inches compared to its Pocket PC
competitors but the Q was never meant to
be a powerhouse
it was meant as a prosumer grade
blackberry replacement I mean look no
further than the spacious QWERTY
keyboard and the side mounted jog dial
the q replicated the BlackBerry layout
perfectly with scroll wheel on the right
side and a back key placed directly
underneath unlike a blackberry though
these controls were augmented by a
four-way d-pad and
back and send an end keys just below the
display giving the user a choice in
terms of navigation the jog dial on our
unit here is broken but when it did work
it was quite handy for scrolling
webpages and emails and text messages
and the keyboard was actually pretty
great for its time though windows
Mobile's half-hearted predictive text
and the tendency to drop the occasional
character kept the cue from real
messaging powerhouse status illuminating
that keyboard was the same shade of blue
as the electroluminescent backlighting
on the razor completing the futuristic
look of the cue our unit here is
finished in the original silver but
Motorola would later release black and
gray soft touch variants both of which
looked very sharp the q' includes many
forerunners of today's standard
smartphone features a mini USB port
instead of micro USB a mini SD card slot
instead of micro SD a 2.5 millimeter
instead of a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and even an IR port an accessory
that disappeared for a while but which
is finally starting to make a comeback
there's no Wi-Fi on board but the Q's
radio does support a video the
high-speed data of 2006 when 3G was
still as good as it got this being a
Motorola device phone calling was a
pleasure and the speakerphone was loud
and the build quality was high enough
that you could toss the queue around
without worrying too much about jarring
a button loser busting the battery door
off the 1.3 megapixel camera produced ok
photos for the time which could be
shared via MMS or email remember this
was before mobile Facebook and Twitter
took off the queue launched on Verizon
at a non-contract price of 1 $99.99
after rebates very reasonable
considering everything packed into its
tiny frame it would later go on to other
carriers and it would unfortunately
develop a somewhat spotty reputation and
user reviews it's likely the return rate
on this device was pretty high but if
you were willing to put up with its
quirks there were definitely good units
to be found
I carried mine for a solid year
something of a personal record before
the summer of o6 many people still
associated windows smartphones with big
clunky stylus Laden monsters built only
for the Geek Squad with the Q Motorola
changed all that it built a slim
super stylish smartphone with a great
keyboard a bright display and a
blackberry beating feature set that
satisfied all but the most hard-core
mobile mavens the cue played a huge role
in consumer izing the smartphone in 2006
no small feat and one that deserves not
just a nostalgic look but our continued
respect folks that's going to do it for
this episode of the pocket now throwback
