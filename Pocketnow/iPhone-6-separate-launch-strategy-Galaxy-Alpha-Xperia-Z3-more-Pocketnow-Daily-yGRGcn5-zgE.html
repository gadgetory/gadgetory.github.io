intentionally launching the iPhone 6
separately this year new leaked photos
show us a galaxy alpha from Samsung with
a metal enclosure and as you blurred
some records as the company's g3 has
proven to be a hit I'm hiding that any
better and Apple the only thing that I
would want is inclusion of a microSD
card slot on the next iPhone not
separate things this is PocketNow daily
let's begin today with the official news
as those of you interested in more color
options with the HTC One m8 there are
but sort of at least initially right now
you can get the red HTC One m8 on o2 and
the UK and then you get it in pink at
The Carphone Warehouse these devices
will be available in August but you can
pre-order them today and yeah they look
really cool though sadly we don't have
any dates on when this will expand to
other carriers or other country and one
of the most anticipated devices of the
year is the Sony Xperia z3 even though
the z2 has only been out for a couple of
months we know that the company is
sticking to six-month cycles and this
time we have some leaked photos coming
from famous tipster EV leaks heed this
show was that the previous leaks that we
saw were actually kind of true we do see
it as e3 looks a lot like the z2 but
this time we have this really
interesting curve on the edges and
obviously this is metallic as well so we
are looking forward to this device and
will most likely see it at Aoife in
Berlin now one of the ways that we were
not waiting for but that looks clearly
hot as the Samsung Galaxy alpha link to
the description look at the photos you
see compared against the Galaxy s5 and
the reason why this is cool is number
one because the chassis is made out of
metal at least on the edges so yeah this
would be the first metallic galaxy of
the Samsung F the galaxy f that's being
rumored doesn't happen first but it's at
a 4.7 inch display it doesn't seem to
have expandable storage but then again
it looks like a high-end device even
though the back is still plastic so
let's see what we get from this galaxy
alpha is we were definitely not looking
forward to it now a company that is
breaking records as LG as the company
has been doing an amazing job with the
smartphone offerings over the past three
years and it just told us that it sold
14.5 million units a new
record for them but even though we don't
know which ones are l-series and which
ones are g-series the company does claim
that the g3 had a lot to do with it so
leave us a comment down below and tell
us that you get the g3 or do you want
that phone cuz I actually do want one
and finally for the interesting news of
the day reports claim that the iPhone 6
might be launched separately this year
usually Apple launches either just one
device one time a year or two devices at
the same time as it happened last year
but digit types claims that apparently
the company is thinking about doing a
separate strategy in order to number one
compete because we do know that HTC
sanzang and everybody else launches
everything in spring but other than that
they don't want to make the same mistake
they did with the iPhone 5s in the
iPhone 5c where the 5s outsold itself
and then the 5c they ended up with so
much stock that they had to figure out
how to sell it but you know that leads
you to the question of the day do you
think that this is a smart strategy for
Apple to stick to six months cycles or
to launch two devices separately because
in my particular case I think it would
be smart for Apple to keep its
top-of-mind somehow in the industry but
the problem is what happens when you buy
an iPhone now and then another better
one comes out six months later I don't
like it when that happens with samsung
devices for example leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends yes
