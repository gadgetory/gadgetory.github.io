back when I was in Windows Mobile guy I
really like switching out the shell
which is the stock UI that you get
around with with third-party stuff and I
really like some stuff by SPB soft you
windows mobile guys know what I'm
talking about well soon gives you that
same capability by replacing its
launcher apps or its home apps so today
I'd like to show you what one really
innovative designer did when he
developed a soon interface for the
Android let's go take a look
okay so this is a nexus one running
android 2.2 and what i've done is i've
gone out to the marketplace and I
searched for zune home by faded divinity
and I found this app this is a
replacement launcher app it costs 99
cents us you can try it and uninstall it
within 24 hours to get a refund as
evidenced by our little uninstall and
refund button right there but I think
it's pretty impressive for 99 cents
still a little rough around the edges
but it's a very nice app so without any
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
it now you'll notice right away you've
got basically four parts to this you've
got your wallpaper in the background and
this reuses the stock android wallpapers
any custom wallpapers that you have in
even live wallpapers like the one I'm
showing you right now it's got kind of a
widget it's not really a widget it's
just a weather information area if you
will this is that my current weather is
partly cloudy and 70 degrees which
looking outside it seems like that's
about right it's got a little quick
launch tray or a pin tray over here
which I don't have anything in right now
but I'll show you that in just a moment
and then you've got your stock list of
frequently used apps now you can
customize these through the settings and
add stuff that you want remove stuff
that you don't for example let's go in
to the Settings down here and let's add
facebook and let's add Twitter and go
back home and now you'll notice we've
got facebook and twitter right there do
we want to call somebody let's tap on
phone and it opens up the phone dialer
simple as that but when i first got the
app nothing else worked other than
marketplace and settings everything else
i'd tap &amp;amp; tap &amp;amp; tap and it would never
ever ever do anything and it was
frustrating in fact it was so
frustrating i have to go out spend a few
minutes googling it to find the answer
so let me give you the short cut right
here let's go into our apps you'll
notice a little bit different looking at
drawer here and let's say i want to wire
up my browser to the internet word on
the home page so i'm going to tap and
hold and now i can either pin it to my
quicklist or watch it from any one of
these so i can launch
from internet and then when I tap on
internet right there it works just like
it should but it doesn't have to and the
reason that doesn't come pre-wired is
for example music I've got music wired
up to launch Pandora not to launch the
stock music player because that's what I
use to play my music so it's kind of
nice that it's all of that configurable
let's go ahead and jump in here and I'll
show you the last part this is angry
birds it's an awesome awesome game that
we should be getting a full version here
any time now let's say I want to pin
that to my quicklist now over here on
the side I've got that icon and when I
scroll up and down it's stays stationary
I can go in and look at my quicklist
just like that and then if I want to
remove it I simply tap and hold and it
will unpin it from that quick list so
really really kind of cool very soon
like not entirely zune HD ish in fact if
we go back in here to settings you can
see some of the Metro style I don't know
that the overall Metro ish look how do
you really call that kind of neat really
really ingenuity putting an entirely
foreign you I on to an android phone and
just really making it work for 99 cents
it's well worth it for impressing your
friends it's really worth it so go ahead
and give it a try if you like this kind
of video and you want to see other
alternate launchers you're going to want
to subscribe to the pocket now video
channel if you haven't done so already I
assume you already have but I got to
keep reminding you if you like reading
about this kind of stuff head over to
pocketnow.com and read some of our
articles we cover all kinds of stuff not
just android not just launcher but all
the different mobile platforms including
that one from apple i forget its name on
a phone I don't know but go ahead and
take a look and yes that is humor so for
pocketnow.com I'm Joe Levi go ahead and
leave me comments and let me know if you
have found a very cool home launcher or
an alternate UI or if there's something
that you'd like to see in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
