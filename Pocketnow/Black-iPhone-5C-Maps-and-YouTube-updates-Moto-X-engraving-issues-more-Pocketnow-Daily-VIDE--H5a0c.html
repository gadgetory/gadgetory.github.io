the basic colors we should expect go
goes all that with their software
designs for their new applications and
if you like engravings on the new Moto X
you might not be in luck I'm hi Mary
better and the reason why I don't like
engravings is because my name is tough
enough to pronounce but this is pocket
out daily as long as they off with the
official news google has updated their
applications youtube and maps and in the
case of youtube would makes it cools
that you can now detach videos and watch
these as you browse for other videos
kind of cool and aside from that in the
case of maps for example you can now get
ways information for traffic data so
make sure you update your applications
in iOS and Android now let's start
talking about some rumors as our radars
have been all over the HTC sr for the
longest time and we finally get some
press renders of the device looks a lot
like the HTC One you get boom sound and
everything the design and the chassis
look really good even though it does
seem a little affordable on that side
but aside from that we do get some beats
audio in the logo at the bottom so it
could be that you know the rumors from
yesterday were probably just that and
speaking of rumors we finally get some
photographs of the iphone 5c in black or
well so they say i mean if you look at
the photo and look closely and you look
at all the edges where the camera goes
and everything this leak looks a lot
like the iphone 5 with a case that
schnucks so well on the device that this
is just an iphone 5 with a case the
colossi design in the back and
everything does not resemble any past
product obviously not the iphone 3gs in
any case so it does seem as if Apple is
probably not building this phone and
black or we never know just stay tuned
for that and speaking of some odd rumors
remember all that flexible display
technology that we've heard about a
trade shows but haven't really seen in
action well it seems that Samsung and LG
have both placed orders for this
technology for products that they plan
to launch in the fall and the only cool
products that get launched in the fall
at least from Samsung are the Galaxy
Note lineup so I'm not going to imply
anything just here you never know but
still we're still trying to figure out
what the whole point of a flexible
display is if the rest of the chassis of
the phone is not so we'll see and
finally for the odd news of the day that
custom
moto X is now landing on everybody's
door step and as it turns out things are
both good and bad i mean our own tailor
barn order his own and well he just sent
us photos of it and it looks really cool
but still some people are complaining
that either the engraving that they want
is not available or not permitted or in
some cases we've been unheard of editors
of other publications complaining that
they get a call like two days later from
Motorola stating that sadly their
engraving will not ship with their phone
and while the phone is already shipped
actually so they can't really do much
but buyers we wear remember that the
Moto X can be returned after a month if
you're not happy with it so that leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think of all these custom-made
options for the Moto X or any smartphone
is it something that has really
compelled you to consider the Moto X in
my particular case I do love the custom
colors and everything I just don't think
I'd engrave a phone just to make it
easier to sell but leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends you
