Galaxy Note and Galaxy S lines for a
while now but this is the first time
we've ever found one useful I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
quick review of the S view flip cover
for the galaxy s4 so the deal with the
older samsung flip covers is they
completely block to the screen and the
phone didn't know whether they were open
or closed
Samsung has addressed both of those
shortcomings with the S view cover for
the galaxy s4 and finally created an
accessory that enhances the
functionality of the smartphone rather
than detracting from it the S view cover
snaps on just like a battery door
in fact it replaces the entire back
cover of the device giving you a chance
to scuff this one up while keeping the
stock cover pristine in your top drawer
for fancy nights on the town or whatever
there's no wireless charging capability
built into the SVO cover in its current
form though so keep that in mind in a
few months
when Samsung starts offering battery
doors with that feature included once
it's snapped into place you'll notice
that the cover doesn't add much if
anything to the devices thickness the
exterior surface is soft but features an
odd texture that feels almost like an
old nylon jacket the inside surface is
much softer almost like felt the phone
is able to determine whether the cover
is open or closed and when closed it
turns off the majority of LEDs on the
display to conserve power
Samsung has cooked up a special
minimized view of vital stats such as
date time signal battery life and
notifications and so on it's reminiscent
of the pared down external displays
found on old clamshell phones and it
shines through the window for a few
seconds after the covers closed or when
you press the power standby button the
small display area means that in theory
the display should consume less power
throughout the day if you're a
compulsive notification checker you
can't interact with the graphics on the
display unless a call comes through
that's when things get cool because not
only can you accept the call using
on-screen controls you can take that
call without opening the flip cover
thanks to the cutout for the earpiece up
top
very handy
the window also serves the purpose of
acting as a pass-through for the camera
lens as well when you first fold the
case back on itself you feel like maybe
it's going to obscure the camera lens
but it doesn't the window does pick up
smudges quite easily though so it may
well diminish your photo quality unless
you compulsively clean it or you can
just take photos with the flip cover
open you can be that guy using the flip
cover made us enjoy using the galaxy s4
a bit more than usual actually it's cool
to be able to handle the device with one
hand without worrying about smudging up
the screen and it's nice just to be able
to drop it in a pocket or toss it
facedown on a tabletop it also saves us
time by skipping the lockscreen entirely
when open and it's not just the special
screen mode that recalls the old days of
flipped dumb phones the moving flap gave
us a real sense of nostalgia in addition
to its utilitarian value we wish there
was a magnet here to keep it closed as
it tends to flap in the breeze somewhat
but that's our only real complaint the S
view cover should launch in multiple
colors alongside the galaxy s4 and
indications are that it will retail for
a pretty steep 70 bucks that's frankly
ridiculous no matter how cool or well
made the cover is but maybe as part of a
bulk accessory order with a new phone
you might be able to find some savings
from a third party if you do opt to
shell out the cash you'll be getting a
very cool accessory that adds to the
pleasure of using a pretty cool phone
and you'll be less likely to scratch up
that beautiful display folks we have so
much more content on the galaxy s4 both
