pocket
come and this is the getting starting
video of the toshiba g 9 10 before i
show you the hardware of the
so i'm going to show you what the out of
box experience is like i haven't turned
it on yet i haven't even put my sim card
in yet but let's turn it on and the
button to power Don is at the top here
let's see what happens I see a green
light maybe I should open the okay
nothing's happening there something
going to happen on the outside Oh
something's happening well that's
happening to get the stylus out the very
very large stylist I'm going to collapse
it down
setting this on the table kind of
reminds me of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt although you
can rotate the screen higher than you
can we're at a higher angle than you can
with the tilt but of course you can't
fold it completely down as you can with
the tote see what's happening on the
external screen nothing yet okay so
something's happening tap the screen to
set up your windows mobile base device
align the screen
oops aligning even more wow that's haha
I guess with the extra pixels on the
screen you have to go and align it even
more alright so let's see what we have
here I'm wondering if any software will
be installed no it doesn't look like any
software is being installed Wow the
screen is fantastic the the the extra
pixels really allow a lot to be fit on
the screen at one time I can see a ton
of icons let's see how these shortcut
buttons respond so I'm going to press
this one at the top nothing happened
there let me try that again my finger no
well maybe they need to be set up let's
take a look at the external screen okay
so we have time here it's a little
pixelated I wonder wonder what operating
these buttons will do looks like a speed
dial menu so you can kind of assign
numbers to to phone number so that you
don't have to open the phone folder to
make a call so that's convenient alright
and I want to increase the spring screen
brightness a lot to the maximum to see
really what the screen will look like
the best that it can look that's not not
terribly bright actually I'm a little
surprised about that alright a lot more
to come next we're going to talk about
the hardware of the device we have a
fingerprint reader and a lot of other
interesting things we're going to talk
more about the oled screen on the front
and if you like what you see subscribe
to the pocket now video youtube channel
we have lots of videos all the time and
that way you can keep abreast of when we
add new ones that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
