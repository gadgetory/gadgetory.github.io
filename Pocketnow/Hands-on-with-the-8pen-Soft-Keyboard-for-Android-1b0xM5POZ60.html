what would have happened if we would
have skipped from desktop computers or
laptop computers straight to smartphones
so we didn't even have the bigger
versions of these computers because
really that's what a modern smartphone
is what kind of keyboard would we have
put on a smartphone well the guys at
8-pin said it would look something like
this let's go take a look okay so what
we're looking at here is a soft keyboard
a sip or in Android terms an IME called
eight pen now eight pen goes back and
says what would have happened if we were
designing a keyboard for a mobile device
and we weren't biased by keyboards that
were on well originally typewriters and
then have been moved over to desktop
computers laptops and then well even
eventually on to mobile devices
themselves via a slide-out keyboard and
then by extension a little soft input
panel or that IME well what would that
have looked like this is what they came
up with what it is is it's four
quadrants with a dot and I mean that's
as basic as it gets what they've done is
they've aligned all the letters on the
keyboard around these rays and they've
arranged them such that the more
frequently used ones are closer to the
center and the last frequently we use
ones are closer to the outside and the
way that you input text is you start in
the middle and if you move your finger
into whatever quadrant your letters in
so if I wanted an H that's down there
I'd move my finger down into that
quadrant but then I have to tell it you
know what is it is it one of those guys
or one of those guys well to do that if
I want one of these letters I move my
finger out in a clockwise direction and
if I want one of those guys I move my
finger out in a counterclockwise or in
their videos they call it an
anti-clockwise direction and I still
have four letters to choose from so how
do I choose one of those well I move my
finger down in there and I go
counterclockwise and I move it around
the quadrants until I
get the letter that I want so because H
is the second one out I have to move
down in here and move counterclockwise
to quadrants and then back to the dot to
register that so let's go ahead and do
that with the word hello let's just do
hello you know because you know it
really likes hello world so we'll go
ahead and do that so I'm going to come
over here so there's t there's H and
we're going to do an e now we're gonna
do an L now we're gonna do another L and
we're lastly going to do an O and there
you go you've got hello now I can do
that a lot faster when I'm not
encumbered by doing it on camera here
and over time you're going to pick up
speed as well the problem with this
entire methodology comes into play when
you're trying to type something that you
haven't used frequently so let's say I'm
trying typing an email here to Brandon
so let's do hello Brandon so I'm gonna
come down here and there's my B so I'm
gonna go around that way there's a B and
then oh I don't know where R is okay
there it is R a but where's n now I have
to look all over underneath my finger
without lifting my finger to find an N
and if I tip my device up just oh it
rotated into landscape mode and I have
now lost not only my keyboard but where
I was in typing that which is really
really a pain so that's one thing that
they need to work on in this ayah me and
I don't know if an IME can tell the
device not to rotate into landscape mode
or not but that you may think that's
really a big stumbling block and you're
never going to use it but remember with
a qwerty keyboard or Dvorak you didn't
know where the keys were to begin with
and you had to really practice and you
had to look then your fingers were over
those keys as well on you know a really
physical keyboard so this is kind of the
same thing it's going to take you a
while to get used to the layout of where
all of the letters are but once you do
that your text input should really pick
up and should be really fast now you'll
notice this isn't all of the letters
first of all we've got a backspace up
here we've got a capitalized button
right there
we have returned and we have numbers and
symbols so it's got kind of all the
things that you need in a keyboard
really and they're all right they're
easy for you to get now if you want to
try this on your Android it should work
on everything from 2.1 up and it is
available for you to purchase and
download in the market now notice I did
say purchase this is not a free keyboard
you do have to buy it and ended up
running me right around a buck 70 or so
when I downloaded it you can go ahead
and download it install it try it out
see if you like it and it's got a really
good tutorial to begin with if you don't
like it remember you've got 24 hours
from the time that you downloaded it for
you to uninstall it which will
automatically give you a refund but it's
something neat and it's really showing
you what you can do to push the envelope
and say what would happen if this is
what was the form factor that we started
with kind of a neat idea I really have
to give the developers credit for coming
up with such a radical concept that
really is relatively fluid but a little
bit frustrating at time is simply
because I haven't used it all that much
and when I say haven't used it that much
this has been my keyboard for the last
two days and I have been forcing myself
to use it for two days solid so it's not
for lack of actually using it it's just
I've been using a keyboard now for well
longer than I want to admit so if you
would like to see similar keyboards such
as this in the future go ahead and give
this video a thumbs up subscribe to our
video channel then leave us comments
down below so showing off what you can
do with alternate keyboard entries in
this case the eight pen keyboard for
