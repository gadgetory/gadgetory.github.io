pocket now calm the Google Search app
for iOS devices has been updated and
it's pretty darn good in fact you might
want to use the Google Search app
instead of going to Safari and for
conducting a search through the browser
let's take a look so typically if you
want to do a search on an iOS device and
you're not running the Google Search app
you go into Safari sure you go to the
Google search bar up here and you'll
type something like you know HTC arrived
let's just do that since that phone just
came out and of course we get our
suggestions as we type and then we'll go
to a page which is formatted very nicely
for the iPhone but it's still not like
an application then we can go into
images we can go into places and so on
and so forth
formatted very nicely no complaints here
but Google has finally updated their
their app for iOS to the point where
it's much better a much better
experience than what you get just in the
browser alone so let's do the same thing
there we'll type HTC arrive I've already
done that and it's going to go out and
search we also have voice search up here
or picture search which is quite cool
and now here's a great feature of this
app if you swipe to the left you get
this awesome little menu that lets you
interact with the different ways you can
see HTC arrive in a Google search
obviously places images news let's go to
news and see what we get there okay so
we get some news of there we can go in
the bottom right corner and open that in
Safari or share it via email from here
we can swipe again and let's go to
images this time and this sort of looks
like it does just in Safari browser but
again you're getting the addition of
this voice search button and the image
search button and everything just is
more neat and tidy within this page so a
really cool app it is free it's called
Google search very easy to download and
it's far improved from where it used to
be when first came out so check it out
if you liked this video please give it a
thumbs up and thank you for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
