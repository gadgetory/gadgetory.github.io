due to some battery issues when those
phone developer preview exceeds user
adoption expectations and the famous
Amazon phone could rely on some tilting
controls I'm primarily that I and I'm
still trying to figure out what Amazon
thinks is natural about tilting a phone
when you're talking to it and this is
parking out daily you know that will we
begin the news we start with what's
official and this is very interesting
probably none of us expected for the
Samsung gear fit to be famous mainly
because it's got this total display that
wasn't really economic at the beginning
Samson figured it out eventually and it
turns out to be the most famous gear out
there it's sold almost one in 50,000
units which is definitely not as big as
any company would sell smartphones but
you know that wearables are an emerging
technologies so this is good they're
sold out let's see when they stop back
up and let's see which is the next one
to sell out and speaking of wearables
one that's been announced but it's not
officially and we get rumors of a lot is
the LG G watch but this time we have
some official images of the SmartWatch
and we get it in black and we get it in
golden white really nice colors i hate
the ban but get some more specifications
water and dust proofing the fact that
the display will always be on which is
interesting but uh that's pretty much it
we don't have a release date yet so hold
your horses now another product that's
not finalized but quite popular as
Windows Phone 8.1 developed for preview
you would think that not very many
people would give it a try but Microsoft
is surprised I mean there are more than
a million downloads already more than a
million units that are testing it out
there already even though there are a
ton of bucks to be iron so this fakes a
lot to number one the size of the
community which is great and number two
the fact that people are really willing
to move away from windows phone 8 and
move to something much better hopefully
they can turn on the phone from standby
as well but stay tuned now speaking
about products the Amazon smartphone
gets more rumors this time we know that
it's got four cameras we know that it's
going to probably bring 3d there's a
huge probability that it won't happen
but interesting apparently the UI is
going to use this 3d system where you
can interact with it by tilting the
phone well yeah it's got four cameras
for reasons we don't know
with four but still the 3d will
apparently do things like for example if
you want to look for the name of icons
without having to do anything apparently
just at this particular tilting gesture
and it will reveal them and we've
already seen so many platforms fail
because of excessive gestures like webos
so let's see how that goes and finally
for the very interesting rumors of the
day it seems that apple's iphone 6 may
be delayed more than Apple wants it to
and reason why is because apparently the
company wants to make this phone
dramatically thin we're talking about
the phablet the 5.5 inch device and
apparently Apple wants to make it so
thin that there is no battery that could
fit in there and they will have to build
a new type of battery but apparently the
technology is not there yet and they'll
have to do something about it apparently
that will probably you know delay things
we don't not sure if that's going to
happen until next year or this year but
still that leads you to the question of
the day how thin is too thin for you
when it comes to a smartphone do you
like kept in your smartphone or do you
like it to be so thin that it's more
ergonomic in my particular case it
depends on the phone the bigger and
thicker it is the list that I like it
but the thinner that it is and bigger
the more that I do know that's not what
she said but still leave us a comment
down below what do you think and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is so
much he follow us on packing out comment
