shows a phone with some dramatic changes
motorola announces a new batch of moto
g's now with number in tow and while we
talk about moto let's just say that the
flagship is about to change its name I'm
high Meadow Nevada and I could totally
care less about the lion king but once
you mix it with Voltron it covers a
whole new meaning this is parking out
daily
the official news that I have to do with
the sous the company has decided to
tease as a zenfone threes before
computex it seems that we should expect
three phones out of which one of them is
a phablet and it seems that the company
wants to focus on things like clarity in
addition to other teasers in text in the
length of the description so far this
seems to be a rather interesting update
to the zenfone let's just hope it lives
up to the hype and speaking of updates
Apple has just decided to launch a new
version of itunes version 12.4 a new
version of iOS 9.3 point to in order to
fix it's a music application deleting
its songs even if it didn't want to
admit it until last minute the problem
is this apparently people that are using
the ipad pro 9.7 alright ending up with
a bricked tablet with certain errors and
forcing them to use iTunes we haven't
been able to verify and we don't really
want to give a try to that on our review
unit because we kind of use it for a lot
of what we do on video but hey just be
where we will keep you posted if there's
another update to fix that and since
we're covering official news Motorola's
event and india just happen it announced
its new moto g 4g for play and g 4 plus
the g4 and g4 play we're not going to go
crazy over they follow the trend of the
Moto G which is a not a two-tier of a
premium mid-ranger it's a mid-range ur
close to low but the cool one here is
that G 4 plus because that is a premium
mid-ranger it has a far better processor
in addition to a fingerprint scanner and
far better camera it seems we cannot
wait to tell you more once our review
units arrived and since we're talking
motorola famous tipster evan blass just
came on record with two very interesting
news for the future moto which
apparently won't be Moto X that's the
news apparently it'll be called moto Z
which sounds terrible but ya moto Z
that's going to be the flagship but
apparently there won't be a new droid
apparently there will be a droid edition
of that moto Z to continue with the
droid you know legacy we cannot wait to
see what Motorola comes up with here or
should I say Lenovo and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with them
one plus three we don't know exactly
when to expect this phone but we've got
some leaked renders and the back reminds
us of an HTC smartphone aluminum with
the antenna bands of the whole g-string
in the middle the camera hump the design
looks really good don't get me wrong I
really like what I see I do mind the
fact that the sandstone back that made
one plus famous is going away because I
really like that design but it's not
like if this is getting any worse it's
the other way around it looks really
good and we see all other one plus
trademarks here like that fingerprint
scanner at the bottom the girls at the
bottom for the speakers this could be a
really great smartphone but it leads me
to the question of the day if you had to
choose do you want this aluminum back or
would you prefer sandstone back for the
oneplus and what changes would you like
to see with the smartphone in my case um
that's a rather interesting question i
would definitely prefer the sandstone
back just because that is something that
made one plus smartphones unique but i
would also like for them to continue the
trend of really great specifications on
a very tight budget let's see if they do
so companies have lost that trend lately
that leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know European friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get these
