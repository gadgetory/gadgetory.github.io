beautiful smartphone but it's also
absolutely impractical for a sporty
lifestyle enter the galaxy s6 active a
heavyweight version of the 2015 flagship
built to take tougher treatment we
covered the differences between them in
a previous comparison and now after
seven days it's time to render our final
verdict I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the galaxy s6 active the actives
Hardware looks a lot like the standard
galaxy s6 wrapped in a super durable
casing and the reality isn't far from
that in years past tough smartphones
equaled underwhelming smartphones on the
spec sheet but with each successive
generation of its active line Samsung
has brought its durable smartphones
closer to parity with its standard
offerings here that means you'll find
the same quad HD display on the s6
active as on the regular s6 powered by
the same Exynos processor backed up by
the same three gigs of RAM
as you may recall we found the battery
on the stock s6 pretty underwhelming so
we were pleased to see Samsung boost its
size by 37% in the active for longer
endurance and here the fact that the
phone's power pack is non-removable
actually works in its favor previous
generations of active suffered from
water intrusion due to their battery
doors not always sealing properly so
omitting that vulnerability entirely
makes the phone even more solid backing
that up is an alphabet soup of
certifications the phone is rated to
ip68 and mil standard 810g the former
rating means the phone is fully
dustproof and capable of surviving
immersion in fresh water in this case up
to one and a half meters of it for up to
30 minutes the mil standard
certification adds resistance to
humidity temperature extremes and impact
damage Samsung says you can drop it from
up to four feet on a hard surface and
these claims have all pretty much held
up it worked fine after a half hour in
the freezer and aside from a single
reboot it didn't seem to mind a long
stretch in direct sunlight either also
after repeated tosses and tumbles
against asphalt and concrete the phone's
polycarbonate casing is pitted and
scarred but there's no lasting damage
to speak up and no shattered screen
either thanks to the slight recess built
into the casing ditto the water testing
will be taking it to greater depths in a
future feature but over the past week
the actives been splashed sprayed
submerged and even left in a full
bathtub for over 30 minutes with no ill
effects it's not without the occasional
weirdo moments for a while after taking
it out of the water it sometimes thinks
a doc is connected which you can fix by
blowing on the USB port like it's an old
Nintendo cartridge and then waiting a
while for it to dry out there are no
such shortcuts for the speakerphone
which takes forever to dry after a swim
during which time it's so quiet and
ratalie it's almost useless but sauce
for the goose as they say most durable
smartphones run into issues like this
and on the whole this Hardware lives up
to the promise of a smartphone you don't
have to worry about too much the
software on the s6 active is exactly
what you'd expect if you've seen our
review of the standard galaxy s6 and
that goes for highs and lows alike on
the high side this is a slimmed down
version of Samsung's TouchWiz user
interface that's much snappier and
slightly sleeker than what's come before
and you can customize it for free with a
growing number of available themes on
Samsung's App Store which we really like
on the low side it's still TouchWiz so
some things that work very well in stock
Android stumble a bit here also the
active is still stuck on a version of
Android that brings out the worst in
lollipops memory management problems
multitasking is inconsistent app crashes
are almost routine and there's a bug
that causes some apps like the game
ingress to crash when launching them
from the new active key but not when
launching them from the app drawer which
is bizarre that odd behavior aside the
active key is a really nice addition to
this phone the activity zone it links to
is the typical predictable outdoorsy hub
containing a lot of useful items that
have been somewhat uselessly grouped
together the real convenience of the
additional button is the fact that you
can set it to start any two apps of your
choosing via a short press or a long
press
either one will bypass the lockscreen
for a very quick launch fortunately you
don't need to use up one of those
shortcuts for the camera because while
Samsung has omitted the fingerprint
scanner from the actives home key you
can still double click it to jump right
into the viewfinder by all accounts the
16 megapixel camera here is the same
exact module in the stock s6 and the
results bear that out
that is to say it's still one of the
best cameras on Android and on
smartphones as a whole
that means crisp colorful photos in
daylight with excellent sharpness and
saturation it means an HDR mode that
does its job and bringing out the
highlights and darker areas without
going so far as to create halos around
everything it means brighter nighttime
pictures that aren't without noise but
are much better than most competition
thanks to optical stabilization and an F
1.9 aperture it means selfies that
despite some distortion at the edges
more often than not come out the way you
want them to regardless of light level
and it means a host of manual controls
that can make a photo like this into a
photo like this with just a few button
presses can it take an ugly picture sure
is it likely - nope
this camera is awesome though and it can
take pictures underwater - carrying the
galaxy s6 active for a week has
reinforced some of the similarity to its
less active sibling but it's also thrown
the differences into stark relief
battery life is the biggest of these
with 3500 milliamp hours of lipo power
the s6 active routinely delivers solid
uptime even with heavy use we've twice
been able to get five and a half hours
of screen on time between charges that
makes it an endurance match for the
Nexus 6 and Droid turbo and just like
those devices
it also offers both wireless and wired
charging options using the included
adaptive fast charger replenishment time
is a little better than one percent per
minute it'll go from zero to 100% charge
in about an hour and 45 minutes with the
power off the negatives are familiar
ones for the most part for one thing the
battery life would probably be even
better without cell standby eating so
much of it a problem we also saw on team
version of the s6 the storage options
are
well non-existent you're limited to a 32
gig version with no microSD expansion
and much of that is eaten up by the
system image out of the box also like
it's active predecessors this phone has
a tendency to turn its screen on for no
reason in a pocket and while the
speakerphone is loud when it's dry
placing it on the back of the phone
makes no sense to us ending on a solid
note the sx active gave us our first
chance to try out a TN t--'s HD voice it
only works when the other caller is on a
compatible phone in a supported market
but paly megahertz what a difference
calls / HD voice are as clear as the
best Skype or FaceTime audio calls with
more fidelity than you'll find on any
standard cellular connection we're
looking forward to this becoming the
norm for voice calls in the future for
now the galaxy s6 active is exclusive to
AT&amp;amp;T in the US and if past experience is
any indication it's likely to stay that
way so you have to be cool with big
orange or willing to unlock it for
little magenta - consider this device
but what you'll get is a more durable
and more capable smartphone than any
Samsung that's come before it lasts much
longer on a charge than the regular s6
and it's effectively the same price to
boot if you're in need of an Android
phone that takes a beating without
surrendering top-tier features the s6
active should be at or near the top of
your list of contenders even if that
means you've got to think about
switching carriers for more on the
galaxy s6 active check out our
comparison with the stock s6 our 24-hour
drop test video and our full text review
available at pocket now and June 23rd
until next time there's been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
reminding you to keep your galaxy active
and your USB dry thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
