electronics company founded in 2009 and
headquartered in sunny Miami Florida so
far the company has reportedly shipped
over 10 million blue branded devices
newest in its lineup what some are
calling the thinnest phone in the States
it's thin it's light and it looks a lot
like an iPhone 6 beyond first
impressions how does the blue vivo air
measure up let's jump right in
the first thing you're gonna notice is
how light and how thin the phone really
is 97 grams and 5.1 millimeters it
really does feel like a display unit the
next thing you'll notice is the bold
bright screen it looks fake but it's not
though it's made of Gorilla Glass 3
the vivo air comes with a screen
protector in the box that you can apply
if you want it also comes with a
lightweight case as well we opted to go
without either and other than a fairly
slippery back we're happy with that
choice it's a four point eight inch
Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of
720p which puts it at a very respectable
306 PPI pixel density colors are hyper
bright and a bit oversaturated but
blacks are deep and text is crisp video
streams tremendously well and watching
serenity was more detailed and crisp
than we've ever seen whether this is
thanks to codec magic it does have an
h.265 Ultra HD video supported by the
SOC or whether it's because of the
Mallee 450 GPU driving the pictures we
don't know under the hood you'll find 16
gig of internal storage regrettably
there's no SD card expansion and there's
only one solitary gig of ram this shows
up in everyday use the processor however
is a little bit surprising
it's a mediatek octa-core clocked at 1.7
gigahertz and it's based on arms cortex
a7 no this is not a dual quad core
configuration either mediatek describes
the mt6592 chip as a true octa-core with
all eight cores firing at once the media
tech chip powering the vivo air is
capable of LTE but blue opted to go with
HSPA+ instead and it's calling it 4G
both on the box and on the carrier icon
in the status bar on the Wi-Fi side only
2.4 gigahertz is supported on 802 11 B G
and n no A or AC here and performance
was only acceptable when it comes to
software
the vivo air uses a heavily stylized
build of Android 4.4.2 kitkat it'll run
all the apps that you're used to and
they'll look like they do on any other
Android but everything else well it's
different from the lockscreen to the
launcher which somehow lacks an app
drawer it's got an infinite unorganized
scrolling homescreen instead
blue has an interesting take on Android
that's for sure you might love it you
might hate it but you've got to give it
to blue for going out on a limb the last
it looks like the heavy customization is
already delaying OS updates with no
announced timeframe for when Android 5.0
lollipop will be arriving if at all in
everyday use the vive where performs
well heavy apps hang up a bit but we'd
expect that with only one gig ram
benchmarks often didn't want to complete
which we suspect is due to
incompatibilities with the relatively
new media tech tip upload and download
speeds were disappointing even for HSPA+
calls on the device are acceptable but
not great our callers seem to notice a
slight delay which is more than usual
for what we've seen on cellular networks
but it wasn't a deal-breaker overall
audio is strong but the speaker phones
muffle the muted thanks to the away
facing speaker thin means it doesn't
have a huge battery to weigh it down
it's just 2100 milliamp hours
non-removable what's surprising is just
how much time we got between charges
after one day and six hours of moderate
use we still had 70% left
however start watching some streaming
video and well you're gonna see that
number drop fast unlike smartphones from
some other manufacturers blue doesn't
cheat by sending their phone is thin
then bumping the camera module out the
back side the vivo Ayers camera sits
flush with the back of the phone sure
it's only 8 megapixels but it still
shoots video at 1080p using that h.265
Ultra HD video codec that we talked
about before pictures taken with the
phone were acceptable and video was
decent you're not gonna win any photo
contest here
but those aren't the contest that blue
is trying to win with this thin
lightweight 8 quart beast visit if
you've got an Amazon Prime subscription
you can pick up the white edition of the
vivo air for just hundred ninety-nine
and that's unlocked for a device with
these specs as long as you don't live
and die by LTE and if you want bragging
rights about owning one of the slimmest
phones around you just can't go wrong
