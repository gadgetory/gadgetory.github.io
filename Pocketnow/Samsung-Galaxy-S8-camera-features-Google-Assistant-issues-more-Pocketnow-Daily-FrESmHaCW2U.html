could include major changes to video the
amount of deals to get yourself an LG g
6 is kind of insane that was about to
make some major changes to the App Store
with its future version of iOS I'm hi
Mary that I and the this t-shirt is to
commemorate the fact that I am still
waiting for my Nintendo switch usps any
time now this is parking out daily
official list today begin with deals yet
again I'm going to try to not behave
like a fanboy but I have really enjoyed
my time with the LG G six and if you're
in the market for new smartphone this is
probably a good way to go right now if
you go for AT&amp;amp;T for example there are
buy one get one free deals if you go for
t-mobile it's a six hundred fifty
dollars and then we've got verizon deals
coming around the corner tomorrow and
bear in mind all these deals include a
Google home in the bundle I would highly
suggest you consider definitely i'll
talk about HTC as the company has began
teasing something to happen on March
twentieth but the interesting part is
that number one is only being announced
in Taiwan it's only on the Taiwanese
facebook website and the other thing is
that that it says that spring is coming
which we kind of know so the question is
exactly what is it that we're getting
that's not the spring in the place like
New York for example where it keeps
snowing and I'm sure in the rest of the
world whether it's just crazy now out of
all ironies following the fact that you
rarely can get the latest and greatest
version of Android even on Nexus devices
in some cases we hear that the Google
assistant is not for everyone bear in
mind we still don't know exactly what
Google is doing here but apparently the
Google assistance is not going to launch
on tablets or at least not now not
exactly sure why or if it's just the
fact that you're going to wait but even
if you have google made tablets you
can't get the gloom assistance which is
rather weird now how about if we talk
about Apple as even though we don't know
if the next version of iOS is going to
be called iOS 11 we do know is the
company has begun telling consumers that
if they're running applications that
won't be compatible with the next
version of iOS that the application will
not work and apparently we're talking
about almost 200
applications 187,000 to be exact which
means that developers will either have
to update their applications or they
simply will lose support and the
application will simply not work on this
new version of iOS makes a lot of sense
there are a ton of apps over there that
are just abandoned it would make sense
for Apple just clean them up with
necessary but paste we'll see what
happens and finally a very interesting
news they have to do with the samsung
galaxy s 8 samsung is made of a big deal
for cameras to play a big role on their
Galaxy smartphones of the galaxy s6 or
pretty much since the Galaxy Note 4
that's all great apparently the company
plans to innovate again on video to a
certain degree you saw how Sony and its
Xperia the XZ premium I think these
names let's get confused but we know
that it's got this high frame rate slow
motion video apparently Samsung is
planning to do something close to the
same 1,000 frames per second and its
capabilities of recording that we're not
exactly sure what resolution that will
be but it's great to see that Samsung
continues to push the bar that's awesome
the only thing is I have a question for
you all today how often do you record
slow motion video that's something you
care about in my case I actually care
more about time-lapse videos and slow
motion they're cool at all it's just I
rarely used them leave us a comment down
below with open-toe your opinion branch
it all the way it goes if you want to
get the news earlier before the video
was filmed well love apaga now calm and
hit that subscribe button down below for
more videos like this one it also follow
me on Twitter hind underscore leave it
i'll run instagram at hi natalie better
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am hi Mary that
I think so much for watching we'll see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
