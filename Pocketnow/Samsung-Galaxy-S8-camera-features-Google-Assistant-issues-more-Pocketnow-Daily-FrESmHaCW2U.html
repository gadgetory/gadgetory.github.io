could include major changes to video the
amount of deals to get yourself an LG g6
is kind of insane and Apple is about to
make some major changes to the App Store
with its future version of iOS I'm Jaime
Rivera and this t-shirt is to
commemorate the fact that I am still
waiting for my Nintendo's switch USPS
any time now
this is pocket out daily if they saw
yesterday begin with deals yet again I
am going to try to not behave like a
fanboy but I have really enjoyed my time
with the LG G 6 and if you're in the
market for a new smartphone this is
probably a good way to go right now if
you go for AT&amp;amp;T for example there are
buy-one-get-one-free deals if you go for
t-mobile it's at just $650 and then
we've got Verizon deals coming around
the corner tomorrow and bear in mind all
these deals include a Google home in the
bundle I would highly suggest you
consider definitely I'll talk about HTC
as the company has begun teasing
something to happen on March 20th but
the interesting part is that number one
it's only being announced in Taiwan it's
only on the Taiwanese Facebook website
and the other thing is that it says that
spring is coming which we kind of know
so the question is exactly what is it
that we're getting that's not the spring
in a place like New York for example
where it keeps snowing and I'm sure in
the rest of the world the weather it's
just crazy now out of all ironies
following the fact that you rarely can
get the latest and greatest version of
Android even on Nexus devices in some
cases we hear that the Google assistant
this is not for everyone
bear in mind we still don't know exactly
what Google is doing here but apparently
the Google assistant is not going to
launch on tablets or at least not now
not exactly sure why or if it's just the
fact that you're gonna wait but even if
you have Google made tablets you can't
get the Google assistant this is rather
weird now how about if we talk about
Apple as even though we don't know if
the next version of iOS is going to be
called iOS 11 what we do know is the
company has begun telling consumers that
if they're running applications that
won't be compatible with the next
version of iOS that application will not
and apparently we're talking about
almost 200,000 applications 187,000 to
be exact which means that developers
will either have to update their
applications or they simply will lose
support and the application will simply
not work on this new version of iOS it
makes a lot of sense there are a ton of
apps over there that are just abandoned
it would make sense for Apple to just
clean them up if necessary but hey we'll
see what happens and finally a very
interesting news they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy s8 Samsung has made
it a big deal for cameras to play a big
role on their Galaxy smartphones as the
galaxy s6 or pretty much since the
Galaxy Note 4 that's all great
apparently the company plans to innovate
again on video to a certain degree
you saw how Sony and it's Xperia Z X Z
premium I hate these names I always get
confused but we know that it's got this
high frame rate slow motion video
apparently Samsung is planning to do
something close to the same 1000 frames
per second and its capabilities of
recording now we're not exactly sure
what resolution that will be but it's
great to see that Samsung continues to
push the bar that's awesome the only
thing is I have a question for you all
today how often do you record
slow-motion video is it something you
care about in my case I actually care
more about time-lapse videos than
slow-motion they're cool and all it's
just I rarely used them leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion French you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed
