ambitious smart phone yet will play
services 7.3 brings big improvements to
Android wear and Bianca watch doesn't
bring good news of third-party
developers I'm hanging that iveta and
trust me I didn't plan to spend
Tuesday's rushing but that's just the
way it is this is parking out daily
believe it or not this is one of those
few days that is packed with official
news starting with Google the company
has just announced the Google Play
services 7.3 d up they should roll out
to your phone's very soon and what we're
getting here is a ton of updates but the
most important one comes to android wear
because now you won't have to be
disconnecting one watch and connecting
the other which you currently have to do
now you will be able to have as many
Android wear watches as you want
connected to your phone which is great
we just wonder how many can you have on
active at the same time without them
dying with the battery even though we've
got a ton of official news from LG let's
begin with watch urbane the committee
has already made it official in the
United States you can get in the google
play store for three hundred and fifty
dollars and yeah the price is a little
steep considering you're getting a G
watch our new chassis but then again
that chassis looks really good and most
of us here at park and now really like
watch urbane and yeah it should be
launching in other countries as well
very soon who also brought some very
interesting updates to Google now as the
company has expanded the now API to as
many as 70 yet 70 applications that will
now be able to take advantage of google
now and this will allow them to provide
you with fitness information the dist
friend to other things like selling you
stuff which is probably a little bit of
an issue as Google now is a little bit
convoluted already with Google's cards
and you can imagine all these cards also
coming to play here but we would like to
see it implemented and we will keep you
posted and see how useful at it imagine
on Android we're probably the only
negative official new sedap do with the
Apple watch as the company has already
made their policy official regarding
applications that only give you time
they will not be accepting and we're
talking about watch faces the company
has pretty much said that the 10 watch
faces including the Mickey Mouse one are
the ones that you need that you won't be
getting any from third-party developers
nobody also teased that we might be
getting watch phrases soon and probably
these things could change when the
native SDK launches but that's not the
case right now 10 watch faces including
Mickey Mouse that's what you get and
finally for the very hot official news
of the day LG has finally unveiled the
g4 and I'm not even going to bore you
with the specifics of what we're getting
because everything that the company T's
we got we got the f 1.8 aperture camera
we've got the Snapdragon 808 processor
which gives you the new generation LTE
connectivity in addition to expandable
storage two thousand million power
battery the leatherback options in
addition to ceramic and every other
thing that we teased it was a big event
that happened in many countries it will
start retailing today in Korea we should
expect it in our country's very soon and
we've got a ton of videos covering what
the LG g4 is and it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about the LG g4 the announcements and
everything you're getting because in my
case I think this is probably the best
smartphone of the year so far and sure a
lot of people could argue with the
galaxy s6 and whatever but you've got
expandable everything here which is
probably the reason why I'm compelled
for the g4 but it'll all depend on our
full review but leave us a comment down
below what do you think friends you know
the drill likely when I get the news
earlier before this video was filming
sure you follow us on talking out our
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you follow me on Twitter hi
managers watery mehta please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high memory better thank you
