its success with developers we get the
first leaks of the future ipad mini 4
and Google seems to plan a future with
Wi-Fi everywhere I'm hi Mary vetta and
please don't tell me it's wednesday i
still have too much work to do this is
blocking out daily the official news
today start with Microsoft as the
company has now made its office
applications on Android official for
everyone in the past that was just a
preview it happened last month but now
you can download them completely free
obviously there are some limitations but
it's great to see that the Android
devices both phones and tablets will now
be capable of using these tools really
cool links in the description down below
to get your copy and for those of you
joining us in the skepticism over the
success of the Apple watch Tim Cook was
in a recent interview with Bloomberg
Businessweek in China claiming that more
developers have supported the Apple
watch before launch of applications then
every other product that's had the
iphone for example in 2008 was only able
to get 500 apps at launch of the App
Store the iPad one thousand applications
and apparently the Apple watch already
has 3,500 apps which is not a bad way to
start for native applications we just
want to see them and speaking of Apple
and tablets one product that is
desperate for revamp is the ipad mini
and we get the first leaks of the case
of the propyl ipad mini 4 and good news
it seems that it will look a lot like
the ipad air 2 there is no mute switch
instead we get another microphone and we
get a single line for the speakers which
is okay we just hope that there are
other tricks down the sleeve of this
ipad mini 4 particularly in the ram
department since we don't want any
differences between ipads we'll see and
for those of you that we're going
haywire over the rumors of the galaxy s7
launching along the next-generation
iphone well we've got other trusted
sources claiming that no no galaxy s7
apparently samsung is committed to the
typical launch cycles that it already
has but one product that is not included
these launch cycles is the rumored
galaxy s6 plus or edge plus or whatever
the name of this product will be
and give it the fact that we get more
trusted sources climbing this problem
would happen let's see if it happens
along with the iphone as well and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day it seems that google is soundly
investing in bringing Wi-Fi to new york
city and the reason why we know this is
because silent companies you know google
sponsored or Google built companies are
now investing in a project called link
NYC which has the idea of bringing
public Wi-Fi to new york city streets
which is really interesting project
particularly at a time when project phi
is happening and it does lead me to the
question of the day this project fire
sound like a more enticing project for
you when you invest in it if cities had
public Wi-Fi because in my case I would
particularly because it just shows us
that this company is willing to invest
more in it but leave us a comment down
below what is your case frenzy little
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was still
machine you follow us on out
cotton to start trying to channel as
well you follow me on twitter hi
managers Corey better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high metairie better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
