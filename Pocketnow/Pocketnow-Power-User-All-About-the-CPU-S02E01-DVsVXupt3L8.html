electronic devices are an integral part
of our daily routine what's inside them
that gives them the power to do so many
amazing things I'm Joe Levi and on
today's episode of a pocket now power
user we're going to talk about the brain
that powers your device the CPU
the central processing unit or CPU for
short has been around for quite some
time but has changed significantly over
the years traditionally the CPU has been
the traffic cop the component that
handles and routes all the commands
flowing through a system to the place
where they need to go it's backed up by
other components like the ALU for
processing mathematical computation
storage for long-term retention of data
RAM in which applications run GPU for
outputting what you see on your screen
and numerous other subsystems today many
of these subsystems are built into just
a few chips often called a
system-on-a-chip or SOC regardless of
how many subsystems are integrated into
an SOC the CPU still lives at the heart
and does most of the leg work the faster
CPU is the quicker we can get things
done but fast is a relative term to
figure out what that means we've gotta
dig a little deeper not all CPUs use the
same lingo some cpus are built around
risk where others use sisk your desktop
computer probably uses a cisco processor
complex instruction set computing your
smartphone and tablet probably use a
RISC processor reduced instruction set
computing the definitions of these two
terms continue to evolve but from a
basic perspective RISC processors and
the programs that ran on them were much
more basic than the complex programs
that could run on a cisco processor risk
was used for embedded and specialized
hardware or such was the theory whereas
sis was used for larger and more
powerful systems today we see those
lines blurred and the instruction sets
of many risk based processors are just
as large as their sisk counterparts
the clock rate or frequency is the speed
at which a CPU can execute instructions
the faster the clock rate a faster can
get things done just like your heart the
CPU can only operate within a predefined
set of frequencies run it too fast and
things get unstable and usually pretty
hot run it too slowly and your system
slows to a crawl to pump more data
through just like your heart pumping
more blood you either need to go bigger
or add more pumps to increase CPU speeds
Engineers simply added more transistors
this essentially makes the CPU bigger
and be able to handle more data in the
same amount of time Gordon ymore
co-founder of Intel Corp described a
trend in a paper he wrote back in
nineteen sixty-five he predicted that
the capabilities of electronic devices
would improve it roughly exponential
rates the concept that transistor counts
and densities would double at a fairly
predictable rate has guided the
semiconductor industry for decades
originally this period was approximately
18 months you could count on your
computer doubling in speed about every
year and a half today that rate has
slowed to about every two to three years
we often equate speed to the frequency
at which the cpu operates while
frequency measured in mega Hertz or
gigahertz is certainly an important
factor there are many other
considerations when talking about speed
this has led chip manufacturers like
Intel and AMD to shy away from marketing
their chips based primarily on their
speeds now manufactures emphasize model
numbers over clock speeds
what about quarks well a core is simply
another processor if you want to go
faster add another one some computers
such as high-end servers have multiple
sockets to accept multiple individual
processors as you can imagine this takes
up quite a bit of space on a motherboard
to provide a similar benefit without
doubling the required space or tripling
or quadrupling manufacturers began
building additional processors onto a
single chip today we have dual core quad
core and so on while this approach
certainly increases observed performance
there becomes a point where the CPU is
no longer the bottleneck and some other
component or subsystem holds the entire
system back what about sighs and by size
I mean nanometers CPUs consume quite a
bit of power risk chips generally
consume less power than their sister
parts as chips get faster they run
hotter and they use more electricity to
power them to mitigate these factors
chips are made smaller and more
efficient smaller is measured in the
nano meters of their construction this
size has progressed from 90 nanometers
to 45 and now we're down into the 20s
chips built using smaller construction
require fewer raw materials to construct
them they consume less power and they
put off less heat all of which are very
beneficial in portable electronics so
what does all this mean there was a time
when you could easily calculate the cost
benefit of upgrading to a faster
processor back then it was almost
entirely focused around megahertz today
there are many many more variables to
consider when evaluating the CPU inside
a device you're looking at speed is now
only one component of the equation power
consumption is now almost equally as
important maybe more so because there
are so many variables deciding on which
is the best is no longer black and white
it will vary by application
and more importantly by what's important
to the individual what's important to
you you'll need to weigh each feature
individually to come up with what best
satisfies your needs now that you know a
little bit more about what goes into a
CPU and what things to look for you'll
be a little bit better prepared when
looking at all those specs find out
where the best place is to put your
money thanks for joining us for the
second season of the pocket now power
user make sure you give the video a
thumbs up and tell your friends about it
make sure you turn in next week where
we're going to talk about another
component that powers your mobile
