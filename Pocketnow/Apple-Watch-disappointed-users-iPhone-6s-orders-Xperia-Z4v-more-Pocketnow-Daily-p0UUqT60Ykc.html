to recommend it to a friend the future
LG Nexus might bring some new camera
tricks up its sleeve and believe it or
not a far better Sony Xperia z4 finally
reaches the United States I'm hi meri
behna and after my morning coffee is
check I need to work on the afternoon
edition this is parking out daily the
official new should have to do with Sony
as the company has a nailed a very big
fish when it comes to the US launch of
the Sony Xperia z4 though that's going
to be the z4 V actually it's going to
start in verizon it's going to be a
verizon exclusive at least this model in
particular and even though it has
everything that the sony xperia z4 has
in japan meaning snapdragon 810 it's got
same 20.7 megapixel camera in addition
to pretty much everything else it seems
to have a quad HD display in not 1080p
and this one has wireless charging in
both protocols it's really interesting
we still don't have a price tag or date
but it's now official it should only
take a matter of time and remember that
Blackberry Android phone with a propyl
curity keyboard that we talked about a
couple of days ago it turns out that it
might be a possibility but in
conjunction with Samsung and blackberry
and Samsung has partnered for other
software deals and it seems that the
companies are planning to build hardware
together at least one time and we're not
sure if this will include a cure to
keyboard but apparently it'll bring
Samsung hardware we're running lollipop
and blackberry software we really want
to confirm what this is and if accurate
E is not included it's going to be very
unfortunate and speaking of weird ideas
it seems that the LG Nexus will not just
be resemblance of the g4 and probability
but also will bring a 3d camera and even
though we were very excited about this
phone particularly because we wanted
that g4 camera to reach this device it
turns out that it's probably going to
bring another gimmick we don't know
exactly why we're getting a 3d camera
nor are we sure we're getting a 3d
display and we hope we don't but again
stay tuned as these rumors are getting
really interesting let's move the
spotlight over to Apple as we hear that
Cupertino is already placed
major orders for the iphone 6s and 6s
plus from its suppliers as it turns out
it seems that the company really wants
to fix the demand issues that it had
with the iphone 6 iphone six-plus
remember it took the company four months
to be able to meet demand and yeah that
was pretty embarrassing and Tim Cook's
conference call it made their stock
decline in addition to other problems so
yeah it seems that Apple really wants to
fick this and I guess they figured out
how there are things to stay tuned for
this particular iphone 6 even though
it'll probably look like the same one we
already see and finally for the very
interesting news of the day there was
this recent survey conducted to 52
people owning the Apple watch and I know
the sample is very small but not very
many people own the watch so far and
well this was published in Forbes and it
turns out that not very many people are
willing to recommend the Apple watch to
a friend thirty-eight percent said that
they would but then the others either
were passive or completely detracted
according to them the app experience on
the Apple watch is terrible some of the
applications are completely unusable and
even though watch os/2 is a plan to fix
this it's not going to be available
until the next Apple watch launches in
the market or at least we expect it to
in the fall so it leads me to the
question of the day why do you think
that the Apple watch is not something
you would recommend what particular
thing just don't you like about the
product free to not want to use it in my
case I'll be honest with you it's really
hard for me to move away from the 360
and particularly because the Apple watch
looks like a toy it looks like a Casio
watch in my opinion I feel that the
design could have been bolder and yeah
but that's my opinion leave us a comment
down below what is your case friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is Phil
machine photo was on out comment
subscribe tried to count as well you'd
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore to
be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hime everything thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
