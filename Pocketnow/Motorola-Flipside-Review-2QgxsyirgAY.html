pocketnow.com and it's time to give you
our last thoughts or our final review on
the motorola flipside now before we get
started you can find the full review
article on pocketnow.com and also you
can find our first four videos that came
before this right up here we have the
unboxing we have the hardware overview
we have the software overview and we
have our speed test in comparison so
let's get started leading off our
overview of the Motorola flip side I'm
going to be some of the pros of this
device or what we like about the phone
and what it has going for it and the
first step is actually going to be the
screen resolution now it's not a Super
AMOLED or an AMOLED type of screen for
that matter however it isn't H VGA which
Motorola bills as being a high
resolution VGA it sports the resolution
of 320 by 480 the colors are very
vibrant once again they are not the
quality of a Super AMOLED or an AMOLED
but they do stick out fairly well as you
can maybe see here but if you do go back
to our previous videos you can see it as
well the next pro on our list is
actually the full physical QWERTY
keyboard is a slide-out QWERTY keyboard
and the quality of this keyboard is
almost unmatched we had no problems at
all typing on this keyboard we found it
very easy to use very comfortable and
very efficient overall now as we talked
about on our software overview video
this device features motoblur for its UI
skin social networking is the main focus
of motoblur it will bring your Facebook
feeds your Twitter feeds as well as many
other RSS feeds as far as news weather
sports related information whatever it
may be onto the main screen and in form
of widgets and other applications if
you're someone who's into social
networking you will love this aspect and
it will bring all the right to your
fingertips you'll be able to see your
friends status updates their new
pictures right when you unlock your
phone next up we also like the fact this
device comes pre-loaded with Android 2.1
while it may not be Android 2.2 Froyo
especially with Gingerbread which is
expected to be Android 2.3 coming very
soon it is also not too far behind the
eight ball with only Android 1.6
pre-loaded we enforce you don't think it
will make the cut for making the Froyo
update in the near future and that's
likely due to the processor speed but
with that being said we are still
somewhat happy with Android 2.0 slee we
love the amount of RAM on this
it's 512 megabytes of RAM which is a lot
of the user to multitasks in many
applications without an issue at all and
that's a parent in most case now running
off the end of our overview are going to
be some of the cons of the motorola flip
side or what we feel needs work or may
be out of place and the first ones
actually going to be this optical
trackpad we feel it's been forced it is
very useful however it isn't necessarily
needed some devices would use the
optical trackball and in most of those
devices cases the users actually still
use the screen to navigate through well
in this case you have a 3.1 inch screen
so it's a relatively smaller screen we
feel that they could have actually
extended this down further if they had
eliminated that track the overall
battery life in this device is very
unpredictable some days we're able to
make it through our entire day without
hassle other tries we only made it
through our first few hours of the day
this translates into need and carry
around a car charger or secondary home
charger just in case wherever you may be
in reality that leaves you very
unconfident in your device next up for
the inconsistent speeds that we
experienced while we mentioned it does
have a very good amount of RAM the 512
megabytes of RAM does have a somewhat
slower processor being only 720
megahertz a year ago this was actually a
very fast processor however now with the
current generation of Android devices
this is on the lower end
this causes websites to take longer to
load video is longer process and the
overall experience to be inconsistent if
you aren't a power user per se you may
not notice it and in that case it will
still see you very lastly we had some
reception issues now most people say
that you cannot use the actual bar
system as a 100% accurate way to measure
your reception signal quality strength
whatever it may be holding the flipside
directly next to another Android device
we were seeing one or two bars in the
flipside whereas five full bars on the
other Android device now to test that
figure we also tried making phone calls
on both devices and we found the quality
on the flip side to be much lower
also it did drop some calls on us this
happen primarily indoors so your mileage
may vary and you may not have an issue
whatsoever taking all those thoughts in
tomorrow we decided to give this device
a three out of five and that is because
of the price range or the price tag is
actually ninety nine dollars with a
two-year contract on 18 T so the spec
you get actually fits the price very
well and once again this device doesn't
seem to be geared toward power users it
seems to be geared toward mid-range to
lower end especially if you are a newer
Android user this device may give you a
very good experience
that has been our final review on the
motorola flipside be sure to check out

past videos in this device as well as a
