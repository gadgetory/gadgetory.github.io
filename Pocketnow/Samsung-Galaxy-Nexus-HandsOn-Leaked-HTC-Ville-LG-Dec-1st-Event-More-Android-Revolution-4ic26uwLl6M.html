and tell you all about it leaked images
of an HTC bill another LD tablet begin
to surface and an LG event for December
first as is all speculating all the send
more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi I'm every letter
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's hard to sneak off with what's hot
so what's all this about a planned LG
event for December first well the
invitations called all will be revealed
on December first and the fact that it's
about LG mobile a lot can happen on the
floor of the event but our biggest
better set for this to be the LG nitro
HD that we lead recently it's another
variant of the optimist LT there was
recently launched in Canada so expect
some LT love on either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon
our money is set on AT&amp;amp;T but set your
calendars for the summer first and we'll
keep you up to speed on what happens on
the event speaking of LG it's
interesting to see that they've recently
renewed their partnership with Prada to
build another one of their signature
handsets we expect the whole year
covering the possible launch of the LG
prada k to where the present specs like
a 4.3 inch nova display but we're not
sure it will compete well against the
current powerhouses like the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus that's already rocking at
720p resolution display time will tell
and we'll keep you posted on whenever
this product 82 comes to the air and we
know that all you're interested on this
week is the word Samsung Galaxy Nexus so
let's go through our coverage first of
all we start with Joe Levi's recent
videos on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which
so far we have our unboxing our hardware
tour our first boot video and also our
1080p video test so far the device won
the crown is the best smartphone we've
ever tested hands down and while the
software tool will come in soon with all
our impressions of Ice Cream Sandwich
our full review of the motorola droid
razr is also live make sure you catch it
because the device made 4.5 stars out of
5 which is really good detailed review
links on the description and our flurry
of the samsung galaxy note is also
available it also scored 4.5 stars out
of 5 so hit the link of the description
to see why the device scored so high and
finally make sure you catch Joe Levi's
recent article on how to get Android Ice
Cream Sandwich this keyboard on current
devices really good article now going
through this week's rumors we have
images of an HTC bill which seems to be
the HTC plan idea
there's been a smartphone rocking Ice
Cream Sandwich there's a great list of
specs that we still don't have any dates
hit the link in the description for
details speaking of hcc we also came
across rumors of an HCC supreme though
we're still not sure if this is just
another variant of the quad core HTC
edge that we were talking about a couple
of weeks earlier we also came across an
LG tablet that seems to be a successor
to the optimists tab though sadly we
only have images no details just yet
we'll keep you posted on that and well a
Lenovo device just came across on video
though it's weird because it has this
5.3 inch display and which not sure if
there's going to be a worthy phone or
just a micro tablet but time will tell
and also rumors of the motorola droid 4
continue to surface and now we expected
advice to be leaked released large as
soon as early december on verizon no
details yet but and well finally
facebook just came across rethinking the
idea of releasing another unreleased
smartphone because they do this thing
with hcc n rumors have it that we will
get an HTC buffy but but please somebody
explain to me where they get these crazy
names Buffy what anyways let's head on
over to the dark side as we cover all
things pertaining to rooting your phone
so far if your money is set on the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus you'll be happy to
know that there's already a permanent
solution to get your phone rooted just
hit the link in the description and we
walk you through the post of what you
have to do to get this happening on your
device if you already got it it seems to
be a very easy procedure so would you
recommend it hcc also released their
source code for the recently launched
ACC resound and also the explorer the
desire s and the Amaze it's just a
matter of time before our buddies over
at XDA developers come up with some
custom rom so be patient for that one
that does it for what's hot let's
continue on with what's not and well
after it took shams and Google so long
to release their much expected Galaxy
Nexus you'd expect everything to run
smoothly but apparently there are some
issues some customers are complaining
about the volume buttons having a mind
of their own they activate on their own
without your consent and well buyers
beware that's kind of interesting to see
that the LTE version of the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus will be a little bit
thicker than the hspa+ European variant
that we're currently reviewing so well I
guess that's the price you pay for
having the latest technology though
we're still not sure where we're getting
that LTE variant on our shores that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high Meadow you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
