but not as soon as you think galaxy
note5 gets both teased and then handled
in photos and 1 plus CEO teases that
another device should launch very soon
I'm hi meri behna and the only thing
worse than these summer days is to have
your power go out and then delay your
video true story this is parking out
daily the official news today come from
ZTE the company has a this device called
the blade 6 which is an interesting
product but even more interesting is the
fact that it just received a software
update and this enables for the device
to be able to scan your retina for
security services with a new sky I
application and this is just crazy I
mean we didn't think that it was as
simple as updating software on an
existing device for there to be retina
scanning technology now bear in mind it
takes a photo of your retina and then
scans it so it's not really real time it
seems we'll be reporting more as we
learn and speaking of biometrics you
remember that Sony teased that event to
happen at Aoife uh which is interesting
we see the first leaks of the Xperia z5
and c5 compact and what makes them
interesting is necessarily the fact that
they look like pretty much every other
Xperia out there but the fact that we
see a side-mounted fingerprint scanner
which is interesting particularly
because we're not sure if that's going
to be something you can just tap it on
lock but it's placed in a very cool area
because you're always handling your
phone that way so let's see if it works
as well as other products like apple or
Samsung devices with their fingerprints
gasps and even more interesting is that
I know a lot of you are waiting for the
1+2 to be available for you to buy it
but it seems that the company's not done
there we had heard that one plus was
working on a budget minded device but
the company seal it just sees that there
is a new device coming later this year
and he didn't mention if it was more
budget minded or not meaning there could
be a hotter phone and this was the
budget-minded one we'll keep you posted
as we learn more as well another very
polarizing topic lately is the
possibility of an iphone mini
particularly because some rumors say
that it was going to happen other rumors
say that Apple bitch
the project in March but now we've got
some semiconductor sources claiming that
Apple is building the product but it's
not going to happen until Q 2 2016 this
is very interesting Apple never launches
a separate iPhones meaning this would be
the first time that apple launches one
iphone at one point of the year then
another iphone later but it makes all
the sense in the world to make some cool
competition with the galaxy s7 in the
future let's see if it happens and if it
remains a budget phone because
apparently it's an iphone 6c that's not
necessarily hot and probably for the
very hot leaks up the day we've got
number one teasers of the galaxy note5 I
mean Samsung shows us this image that
clearly shows an S Pen hum so that's
that but even more interesting we've got
some hands-on photos and yes the device
looks gorgeous the only thing is that it
doesn't reveal much of the things that
we want to hear like for example
expandability options sadly these are
not part of the hands on photos there is
this very interesting curve that's back
and surely the design is gorgeous again
but it does leave me to the question of
the day right now you have the chance to
buy a galaxy note 4 which has all the
expandability confirm then obviously you
can wait for the galaxy note 5 which one
would you pick right now if you had the
chance in my case I honestly would wait
for the note 5 expandability is
everything for me but sadly the software
implementation of the note 4 is not at
its greatest so leave us a comment down
below what is your case friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news

machine follow us on poking out comment
