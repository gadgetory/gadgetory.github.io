p30 Pro will feature a quad camera setup
that was apparently trying to merge apps
for the Mac iPad an iPhone but not
anytime soon and Google just sent out
press invitations for their event to
happen reportedly for gaming in March
I'm Jaime Rivera and well I apologize I
know that I had to upload this video
yesterday but it took me forever it's 16
hours to fly to Barcelona we're now here
this is parking out daily if I should
lose today begin with interesting
statistics obviously galaxy unpacked was
very interesting we have an unboxing
video we have our podcast it talks about
this extensively we also have obviously
our hands-on coverage but DJ cope came
on record to state that they had sold 2
billion galaxies ever since launch the
funny part is when you were at the event
and you saw up the phones that are
behind them are actually the galaxy Jay
and every other galaxy grand and other
galaxy phones that are not necessarily
galaxy s s yeah now let's talk about
some sad news as we hear that razor has
laid off pretty much all of their mobile
division that there will not be a razor
phone 3 that the phone division that's
left is pretty much going to focus only
on software updates in the experience
that we have with the current two razor
phones that are out there this is sad
pretty much razor created the category
and I feel that Android games are not
there but I still find the razor phone
to to be a really good phone hopefully
they're just gonna I don't know think of
something else because the smartphone
business is only booming now let's talk
about Google as well I thought that I
was gonna talk about Google i/o but no
the company has just sent out press
invitations for an event to happen on
March 3rd and reports have it that it's
gonna be focused on gaming and from some
sources apparently it seems that Google
is working on this form to play games
through cloud computing where obviously
because the phone is not so powerful
you'll be using the phone as a terminal
I believe I might be wrong we have
already seen this pretty much from Sony
but let's see exactly what we get on
March 3rd
for those of you that are wondering
exactly when is Apple going to merge
iPads Macs and iPhones the answer is
probably never but it does seem that
they will merge the app store
experiences we were hearing that that
might happen and the year we've been
hearing that it would even happen last
year with the launch of the iPad pro but
according to sources it won't happen
until 2020 what are the reasons for the
delay we don't know hopefully it doesn't
mean that we might be wrong and it could
happen later this year it should make
sense for it to happen that way and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with the Huawei p30 Pro from none
other than Richard you just pretty much
came on Weibo and stated that we should
expect the quad camera that's tuned by
like for the next generation smartphone
pretty much know that the event is going
to happen on March 26 in Paris so we're
definitely gonna be covering that event
live it's going to be hot but in today's
question let us know what do you think
about the p30 Pro quad cameras and
everything I mean we've got devices like
the Galaxy S 10 are you excited for the
p30 Pro or do you think that you'd
consider the galaxy more in my case
Huawei has been really surprising as
lately so I am going to wait it out
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
what's on pocket now comment subscribe
to both of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one
