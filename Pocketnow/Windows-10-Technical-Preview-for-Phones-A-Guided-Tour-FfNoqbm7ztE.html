and media options to level the playing
field you've been waiting long enough
for this so let's just jump right in I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is your quick look at the Windows 10
technical preview for phones keep in
mind folks this is a quick video tour
not a review and this is a pre-release
technical build not a finished product
consider this a very early advanced look
at a few of the new features that will
eventually come to Windows 10
we'll be going in order of coolness or
potential coolness according to me you
may disagree with my order if so feel
free to watch another hands-on for the
record I'm testing this preview release
on a Lumia 830 for a list of supported
devices visit Microsoft at the link in
the description below number one new
voice command input for literally years
Google and Apple have eaten Microsoft's
lunch in voice dictation which a lot of
people use so this improvement could be
huge Microsoft sticks to its guns and
technique here you can't manually do
punctuation by speaking period comma
exclamation point like you can on other
platforms but at least the parsing seems
to be improved
Cortana doesn't really get punctuation
yet she just kind of tosses in periods
after a long pause but it's better than
it was on 8.1 and at least you can pause
to think for a second with this version
also as I will keep reminding you this
is just the technical preview number two
Action Center changes be real for a
second not being able to dismiss
individual notifications on 8.1 was a
pain in the limited number of quick
toggles up top sometimes felt pretty
limiting to the toggle issue is easily
fixed in ten just by adding more of them
above an invisible expansion slot and
thankfully you can now remove individual
alerts rather than clearing a whole
group and then there's the quick reply
feature when you get a text just swipe
down on a toast notification to call up
the keyboard and reply it doesn't work
for email or a third party messenger
apps like Facebook at the moment but
it's possible those will be added later
number three the settings screen hey
remember that endless list of
identical-looking options with nary a
hint of iconography or a categorization
what's gone now and holy hell is it
easier to find things also there's more
granular control over things like
brightness it might have taken you five
years but Bravo Microsoft number four
the keyboard cursor remember the little
eraser like nubs that IBM and lenovo
laptops used to have the new Windows
Phone has it too this has barely been
mentioned in the official talk but it's
here and it's awesome to have an
alternative to the traditional tap
directly on the text approach which
still works by the way the execution is
just fine on a horizontal movement but
it gets a little wonky when you're
jumping vertically between lines of text
hopefully this can be attributed to the
early preview build number five the bits
and pieces all these little nuggets
deserve further exploration and in some
cases explanation and they'll get it and
follow-up pieces at pocketnow.com the
preview build is very obviously an early
one with plenty of slow animations and
dropped frames that's no surprise and I
expect it to get fixed going forward but
there are also big aesthetic
inconsistencies that setting screen has
little in common with the older UI
elements just like the new photo hub
menu has little in common with anything
else on the phone different apps appear
to be optimized for different screen
resolutions there's a lot of seemingly
random enforcement of white elements
instead of black white in the email
keyboard white in the brightness menu
white on the Cortana landing page also
while I started off with the same
transparent tiles I had on 8.1 after the
update I wasn't able to get them back
once I tried out the new Windows 10 look
since it's obviously possible for tend
to support the old transparent tiles I
hope we're at least given the option to
retain that look in a future bill and
hopefully the cosmetics will get more
unified as we go forward I'd hate to
think that this way out-of-the-way
location for overflow handles will
become standard on Windows Phone as it
regrettably has on
and Android hey you may have noticed I'm
missing a few headliners here while the
Lumia camera has indeed replaced the old
Microsoft camera as the default shooter
other upgrades like the new browser new
maps and the new office and outlook apps
are absent from my eight-thirty with all
the stuff pending in the software in
such an early state obviously it's not
the time for conclusions of any kind I
just wanted to give you Windows Phone
fans a quick look at what's in store
from Microsoft till then I'll say
goodbye and like Windows 10 I'll urge
you not to forget your next appointment
whatever that may be
we'll have more in depth impressions as
well as the newest info on Windows 10
for phones just as soon as we can get it
out to you folks keep your browser
pointed to pocketnow.com and keep your
thumbs ups coming to this YouTube page
till next time this has been michael
fisher with pocket now captain to phones
on twitter reminding you to keep your
windows insider app updated there are
new discoveries waiting to be made we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
