Pocono calm and this is the hardware
tour of the samsung jack the successor
to the blackjack in blackjack 2 and this
is a windows mobile standard edition has
6.1 operating system running on it and
the cool thing about this phone is it
actually has Wi-Fi and there are not too
many windows mobile standard devices to
have Wi-Fi it also has a tribe and hsdpa
at eight fifty nineteen hundred and
twenty one hundred bands as well as quad
band edge so 850 900 1800 1900 so this
is a world phone it'll work pretty much
anywhere that there is a GSM signal the
device also has an a GPS chip and it's
very fast I was able to locate
satellites in about five seconds the
device features a 528 megahertz
processor with 256 megabytes of RAM and
256 megabytes of wrong the display is
2.4 inches and that's a 320 x 240 qvga
display has a five-way navigation with a
turbo scroll so when you navigate on the
windows most standard it moves very very
rapidly i'll show you that on the
software review it also has a 3.2
megapixel camera the dimensions of this
device is four point four inches long
and two point four inches wide as well
as point five inches in depth and it
weighs about 3.6 ounces and we can open
up the back and look at that will show
you the battery first before we go
around the device and this is a 1480
milliamp hour battery and samsung states
that will work for about seven hours of
talk time or 12 hour 12 days of standby
time so that's pretty neat we'll just go
around the device in like many devices
coming from samsung the device is very
shiny and also very fingerprint prone
there's this chrome inlay around the
d-pad as well as a surround of the
entire device we also have this plate on
the back that
the Samsung and it's also chrome moving
on to the front we have an indicator
light right here if you can see that as
well as the speakers for the head for
the earpiece if we move on to the
keyboard it's actually a pretty nice
keyboard it's a smiley face design so
it's kind of like the motorola q9
unfortunately it's not nearly as
responsive as that keyboard it is much
better than the original samsung
blackjack with the oval keys but not
nearly as good as the motorola q9 on the
bottom of the device we had the
microphone move on to the side we have
the proprietary input for power USB and
a 3.5 millimeter connector for
headphones unfortunately doesn't have a
microphone in it so you can't use it as
a hands-free device moving on to the top
we have a speaker for speakerphone and a
3.2 megapixel camera without a flash so
it just has that convex lens that you
can see yourself on go to the side we
have the power button as well as the
volume rocker and it seems to work
pretty well if we open up the device we
can see the battery will just move that
to the side and one unfortunate thing
about this device is that put the
microSD card next to the battery so you
actually have to take up the battery to
insert the microSD card and this will
hold about 16 gigabytes of memory on a
micro SD card and we have our SIM card
slot right here and take that out and
see that so this is a samsung jack
