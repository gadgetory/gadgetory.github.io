and it's time to get inside the box I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is our unboxing of the Apple iPad air
it's November 1st and that means one
thing it's new iPad day Apple recently
announced this and we thought it was
gonna be the iPad 5 but it's the iPad
air we pretty much knew everything about
it before it was officially announced
and this is the 32 gigabyte model it's
supposed to be thinner lighter and it's
basically sporting the design of the
iPad Mini on a much larger frame and
nine point seven inch display but let's
get into the box and see what it's all
about pretty much guess and tell you
what's inside but we're gonna open it up
anyway cut off the plastic wrap that
Apple is so well known for throw it to
the side and open the box okay so we got
the Space Gray model as you can see it's
got the black front a Space Gray on the
back we're gonna move that to the side
you've got your power block or a/c
adapter
reading materials and your lightning
cable so that is all that's inside the
box nothing underneath there it's just
these things so no earbuds just this
pretty simple implant that out of the
way let's take a look at the actual
device because that's what really
matters
right so it's a plastic off take a look
and it's got a matte finish it's a nice
matte finish kind of similar to what
we've seen on the iPhone 5s that's some
stuff on my hair looks like it's just
stuff like residue left from the plastic
but this is a nine point seven inch 2048
by 1536 resolution display so that is
the same it's 264 pixels per inch this
thing is only 7.5 millimeters thick it
is so thin so thin and it's pretty
narrow it's much narrower not as much
bezel on the side
here and it is only one pound so it's
much lighter than last year's model by
actually almost half a pound it's point
four pounds lighter which is which is
really nice and that matters when you're
dealing with a tablet this size but as
you can see just like the iPad Mini this
has the lightning connector on the
bottom with your dual speakers on the
bottom the speaker on the top your
microphones here 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack at the top power button a
5 megapixel camera your volume control
and your mute switch and that's that's
pretty much it - your home button which
is not touch ID it does not have finger
sensing capabilities it's just a
standard home button and lastly let's
get this thing powered on it should look
just like all the others but hey alright
so we've got this thing powered up and
I've restored it really quickly from an
old backup and we're just gonna jump
through this and we can talk about more
about its internals really quickly it's
gonna take a while to download all these
apps I made that mistake but on the
inside it has 1 gigabyte of RAM like
before it has a 32 point 4 watt hour
battery which is supposed to give it
still about the same 10 hour battery
life and of course it has the a7 chipset
from Apple inside which is actually the
same chipset as the iPhone 5s but it's
clocked at 100 megahertz faster so it's
it's not gonna provide that much of a
difference but other than that this is
pretty much the same as before same
thing very similar software iOS 7 and
it's not all that different from last
year's tablet except for its design
that's the big thing here so you get the
a7 chip and a new design is that in the
display as far as we can tell here looks
just as great as before so we're gonna
be interested to see what this device is
like over you know the next couple of
days and weeks so stay tuned for that
we're gonna have some comparisons up on
the site next week and a full review
following that maybe a couple days and
probably
week after that so stay tuned for that
