say about the Moto X's camera it's one
saving grace was the viewfinder a model
of elegant simplicity that blew away the
convoluted stock Android camera software
today google has introduced an update to
that stock Android viewfinder available
on the Play Store for download on all
devices running Android for dot for
KitKat and above Taylor Martin and I
spent an afternoon with the new software
on an HTC One m8 and galaxy s5
respectively and we're here to share the
highs and the lows I'm Michael Fisher
this is pocket now and this is your
guided tour of google camera for android
kitkat the core of the new google camera
app is simplicity looking through the
viewfinder a shutter button is all there
is to see plus a small expandable menu
toggle the shutter button is anchored to
the right hand side of the display which
will anger lefties but the fact that
it's there means you can tap to focus
without also being forced to take a
photo an improvement over the old moto X
design behind that toggle is a simple
one layer menu that's much easier to
navigate than the previous version
letting you adjust flash HDR which
camera you're shooting with guidelines
and exposure though we can't seem to get
the exposure level to change on our
galaxy s5 the fun stuff happens on that
extensible menu on the left hand side
revealed by swiping right to left
anywhere on the viewfinder that's where
you get access to the camera and video
mode selector as well as fun stuff like
photosphere and panorama as long as
you're running a device with hardware
powerful enough to support those
features sorry moto g owners the biggest
addition to the suite is lens blur
Google's answer to features like HTC's
you focus Samsung's selective focus and
Nokia refocus according to the Google
research blog lens blur uses multiple
exposures to create a 3d depth map of a
scene and then it blurs certain pixels
by differing amounts depending on the
pixels depth aperture and location
relative to the focal plane that's
pretty cool science talk but what it
means in practice is that you spend a
little more time taking the shot as you
need to raise the camera slowly during
the capture to give the software time to
grab enough frames to do its thing it's
a little finicky but
once you've taken a few shots you get
used to it the results aren't perfect
there's often some edge fuzz here and
there and if the space between subject
and background isn't wide enough the
software is easy to confuse but based on
a few hours of testing I think I'd
rather use lens blur than anything else
currently available with the possible
exception of Nokia refocus it's just
less finicky capable of handling a wider
range of shooting situations than the
often impossible to satisfy HTC you
focus or Samsung selective focus
features it's not lens blur that makes
this experience great though nor is it
the panorama or photosphere functions
rather the high point of this new
software is its design everything
adheres to the same aesthetic and the
options on the left the Photos app is a
quick swipe away to the right and if you
absolutely need to get a deeper level
settings they're available and logically
laid out we do wish google would have
left us manual white balance and the
timer and we're also not happy about the
omission of still photo capability and
camcorder mode losing options is never
fun but if those are the sacrifices it
took to make this cleaner quicker
prettier experience possible so be it
we'll wait for those features to trickle
back in with updates for now we'll enjoy
not hating the stock camera experience
on Android for the first time in a long
while
