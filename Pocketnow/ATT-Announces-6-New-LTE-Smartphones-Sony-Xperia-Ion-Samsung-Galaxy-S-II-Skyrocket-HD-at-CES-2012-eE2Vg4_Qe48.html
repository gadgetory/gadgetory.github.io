unbelievable item of Android devices

like to stand still so today I'm going
to show you how glad to take our
smartphone lineup to the next level
let's start with Android today we're in
everything six new Android devices and
they're all powered by el de first up is
another great device from our friends

exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T and is Sony's first el
de smart now you may know that Sony
Ericsson phones are known for having
great cameras this one is no different
it features a 12 megapixel lens and in
4.6 is plain to show up every picture
and every physical pictures look amazing
on the device if you're definitely going
to want to share them and you can do

Xperia ion in the second quarter and you
think it will be a great
addition to our lineup next up we have
two premium Android devices from sarah &amp;amp;

latest in a string of outstanding
devices from Samsung we were incredibly
proud that last year Consumer Reports

smartphone it was also the thinnest 4g
smartphone the thinnest that is until we
actually got the same from galaxy s2 and
from there we had led to bring the sky
rocket which today is one of the most
popular they love these phones in our
stores and today I'm proud to introduce
the skyrocket HD the galaxy s2 skyrocket
HD builds on samsung line of excellence
with a stunning 4.6 5-inch HD Super
AMOLED display it happened 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core engines feeding it video and
I'm if data for our for Gina all by the
way it's razor-thin and you can actually
remove the factory so it's a great break

device to our customers but that's not
all example today we have two special
guest teachers to show you their
