pocket now calm the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
ships with a new version of Android and
with it a new web browser how fast is it
in this video we're going to talk about
the new functionality then we're going
to compare it to the samsung galaxy s2
and the iPhone 4s let's get to it
okay so let's jump into the browser of
Ice Cream Sandwich there are a lot of
really cool improvements that deal with
tab management and full-screen viewing
and a lot of other things and of course
we're going to talk about speed since
speed is very important in a mobile
browser so let's jump into the browser
here and we default to the home page
here we've got an address bar up here
tab management over here and talk more
about that in a minute and going with
the new paradigm in Android 4.0 when
there are more options to see there are
the three dots that show you that there
is a menu but first let's go to a web
page so what we're going to go and we're
gonna go to the tab view here and then
we're going to go into pocket now is
mobile site very quick loading we can't
really pinch to zoom here because it's
not the desktop version let's load the
desktop version certainly more graphic
intents as it loads I'm going to flip
down the page see if we get any checker
boards and we don't it's very clear and
everything is loading and caching very
quickly let's zoom in slight delay there
but very good one of the ways that this
device shines the Galaxy Nexus is in the
high resolution 1280 down by 720 across
display which means you just get to see
a ton of data on the screen and it might
be hard to see on video but I can
actually make out what it says here in
the completely zoomed out view so you
really get that desktop like browsing
experience let's see how screen rotation
speed is there we go then we can flick
down the page we can go in on a link we
can tap on a link see how fast that
comes up pretty fast or over pretty fast
Wi-Fi network here and everything works
and everything looks good let's go back
into portrait let's go into that tab
manager so it's pretty cool how it works
so here it is let's open up a new tab
the beauty is when you get multiple tabs
open what happens then so we're going to
go back to the bookmarks lets open any
and as you can see it's not slowing down
and on now we have two tabs open let's
go to another site will go to Gizmodo
I'll go back into the tab manager now we
have it actually didn't open up a new
tab there so we'll go over there and
open up a new tab go to Gizmodo again
back to tab view now here's something
quote when you're done with the tab you
have two choices to get them off of the
screen you can hit the little X or you
can swipe and that's really cool because
you can really quickly close all tabs
unfortunately there is no button up here
to close all tabs even if you go up here
to the menu option they should have
added that seems like a very simple
thing to do now here's a really cool
setting if we go into the settings and
we go into labs there's something called
quick controls and if you've used
honeycomb you've seen this before so
what it will actually do is hide the
address bar give you full screen
browsing now the way that you need to
bring back the address bar is with a
swipe from the right or a swipe from the
left and you get these quick controls
let me just open up some new tabs to
show you sort of how cool this can get
once you have a bunch of tabs open so
we'll go into the tab view we'll open up
the verge and so now you get this really
fast way to switch between tabs with
this quick control access and again I'm
gonna open a couple more tabs just so
you can really get the full effect on
how cool this works so we're gonna go
plus I'll go back at the tab view and
plus again okay so now four tabs open
and if I go over here let's go back
there if I go over here and move my
finger up I can see all of my tabs I can
actually flick between them just with my
thumb super fast way to move between
tabs while you're browsing the web in
addition to the tab interface here you
can also go to the URL bar by swiping
into the center there or go to the menu
options by going to the three dots as
you've come to expect so really cool web
browser here in an Android Ice Cream
Sandwich it's a lot faster than we got
in previous versions of Android the
pinch-to-zoom
is buttery smooth tab management is very
slick and it's really cool to get this
full screen browsing you can actually
even remove the top bar you might have
seen that in the settings when we were
over in the lab setting we
go totally fullscreen we can even remove
the top bar and Android and just have a
full-screen browsing experience that is
really really nice and really shines
with this high resolution display so how
fast is this browser well let's compare
it to the samsung galaxy s2 and the
iPhone for us okay so here we are we're
actually running opera mobile here on
the samsung galaxy s2 the stock browser
isn't as fast we're trying to get the
best representation of the speed of the
web browsing on all of these devices so
we're gonna try to hit up Engadget is
the exact same time here
you might actually have a little trouble
doing that since they are all in
different places but we'll try it let's
try one two three
mmm that was pretty good except for the
galaxy s2 so we'll let it load we're
actually going to the desktop version
over here so let's go to the desktop
version on the iPhone 4s and on the
Galaxy Nexus not terms but desktop there
we go
all right right away you can see that
the higher resolution screen on the
Galaxy Nexus is letting us see more of
the website actually right here so let's
click down the page a little bit more
motion here on the Galaxy Nexus but very
smooth on the iPhone 4s and also on the
galaxy s2 let's do some speed tests here
let's zoom in to a particular story
let's go to the top story here zoom in
over here
all right so we're gonna tap on these
three headlines let's make a bigger
click target here on each and we're
gonna tap ready-set-go
they're off at the exact same time let's
see which gets there faster
okay the Galaxy Nexus followed by the
iPhone 4s and the Galaxy S 2 is coming
in last year let's flip down the page
see how the page looks again once the
pages are rendered everything is buttery
smooth on all of these devices it's just
a matter of how fast they actually get
to the particulars question let's zoom
back in and we're going to go over to
this hubs button let's get a big click
target here so we can get it all at the
same time let's try that and they're off
at the exact same time and they all
finished pretty much at the same time
there again let's click on to this big
button here the evo 4G now the Galaxy
Nexus finished first followed by the
iPhone for us and the Galaxy s2 is
struggling a little bit there it's seems
to be loading there it is a little bit
behind the galaxy s2 it's interesting to
see if the galaxy s2 is actually lagging
behind the 4s and the Galaxy Nexus here
because for so long it's been the
fastest device in terms of web browsing
speed that we've tested here and a
spinal test we went to youtube.com to
see how these devices handle video
differently so we're gonna go click on
the same story here on all three of
these devices and just see perhaps how
long they take to render the video and
bring it up certainly all of them have
their own dedicated YouTube player and
that is where they will play and instead
of doing it in the browser itself in
most cases so let's try to play these
videos at the same time okay iPhone 4s
was first followed by the Galaxy Nexus
followed by the galaxy s2
didn't play just sort of stop that was
actually just loading let's go back back
and back it's interesting how the back
buttons are always in different places
its back
okay we'll head back we'll go into
another video and see that in action
again let's do this second video in the
listing here again we get the same
presentation very similar this is
YouTube's mobile site it's gonna kick
off the mobile browser enable plugins so
far as settings so an incompatibility
there so here we've got the Galaxy Nexus
and the galaxy s2 trying to load the
same video something must have happened
here with the Galaxy Nexus
it just doesn't play automatically so
out of these three devices the fastest
phone in we're housing the web is
definitely the Galaxy Nexus it's faster
than the iPhone 4s it's faster than the
galaxy s2 and it shouldn't be because
it's Google's latest and greatest
Android flagship premiere phone for the
next year so very high marks with web
browsing we really like the way that the
Galaxy Nexus handles tabbed management I
can flick tabs off the screen you can
use the labs feature where the browser
bar is hidden and you can actually
access it with a swipe from the right or
the left that is really cool it's fast
it renders well the high resolution
screen really brings the web to life
five stars high marks for the web
browser on the Galaxy Nexus and four Ice
Cream Sandwich in general we're to see
the same experience come out on other
devices when we get Ice Cream Sandwich
on newer phones with fast processors and
beautiful border screens so if you liked
this video please give us a thumbs up
and if you want to see a rundown of all
the highlights of Ice Cream Sandwich on
the Galaxy Nexus Joe made a really great
video put the link up here so you can
click back to that and check it out
we'll have the full review soon on
pocketnow.com so keep an eye out for
that and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
