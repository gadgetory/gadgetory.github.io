galaxy s edge the HTC One m9 gets leaked
in its full glory on video and pepper
launches yet another SmartWatch for the
likes of only some I'm hi Mary vetta
enjoying Tuesday's as much as you are
and starting them off right with you
guys this is pocket out daily let's
start the day off right with one of the
products that we are drooling for the
most at end the BC 2015 Barcelona the LG
watch urbane and I even mistakenly
thought it was the G watch urbane but no
watch urbane we've seen it in photos we
love what we see so far but we hadn't
really seen it showcased especially not
on video until today there is a
full-fledged video a phrenology already
teasing what to expect them trust me we
can't wait to get our hands on it at mwc
inbox Emma now we will keep you posted
watch the video in the links in the
description mex news are not necessarily
official when it comes to apple but yes
when it comes to visa the company has
just confirmed that they are deploying
all the Apple pay compatible terminals
for payments across Europe as soon as
April meaning that within the time frame
of April and May we could see Apple pay
expanding to Europe though remember you
have to wait for your banking Europe to
be compatible with the service but yeah
the terminals will be there I guess the
next stepping point is what Apple will
do before at WWDC up next let's talk
about the galaxy s6 we've been wondering
exactly what the edge variant will be
called and we've been dubbing at the
galaxy as edge because of the galaxy
note edge is not the note for edge but
according to certain leaks that came
from US carriers it seems that note the
final name will be galaxy s6 edge which
should make sense for this sense of
continuity let's just hope the devices
as hot as they're teasing it as well and
another highly anticipated device for
the year is the HTC One a 91 that we are
looking forward at MWC 2015 and if
you've been wondering what it looks like
as long as these are not decoys again
man we've got some full videos of what
to expect from this device yes they do
look like fan renders originally so it's
really hard for us to know if these
leaks are real
mainly because HTC's legal team hasn't
done anything to pull them down they
could be fan renders they could be HTC's
decoy to stir attention or they could be
one of the HTC One devices that will be
announced at Barcelona we will keep you
posted but again we're in the
description watch the videos really hot
and finally for the hot news of the day
pebble has just announced its new pebble
time and they did so with a Kickstarter
campaign they pledged for 500,000 bucks
and that actually was reached within the
first 15 minutes last time I checked
then we're getting close to two million
dollars for this new pebble time there
is a new UI a new color display that's
still eating it actually looks a lot
like the gameboy color from years ago
from Nintendo which is really good the
problem is not necessarily that you why
there's this new timeline you I that
focuses on your day which is really
great it's much better than the watch
phase you eyes that we had before but
the problem is the watch it looks
terrible it looks far worse than the
original template it makes me want to
buy a pebble steel mainly because well
the pebble steel looks a lot better in
the whole UI is coming to the pebble
steel as well you're just not getting
the colors but it leads me to the
question of the day and look at it look
at all the photos tell us what you think
about this new pebble time do you like
the SmartWatch is this design something
you're looking forward to because in my
case I am now going to wait for the
pebble time steel sadly but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
