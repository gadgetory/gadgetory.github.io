PureView from a very trusted source and
it looks interesting an iPhone 10s max
just exploded near Columbus Ohio and
we're hoping it doesn't become a trend
it looks like Apple could be decreasing
another 10% in sales this year I'm Jaime
Rivera this is definitely the last video
of 2018 we thank you so much for your
awesome support and expect more content
coming the day after tomorrow
this is pocket out daily happy new year
the official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a
SmartWatch you might want to consider
going a t-mobile because there are
buy-one-get-one-free deals right now for
devices like the Galaxy watch which is
one of our favorites and then the Apple
watch series 4 which is our favorite you
can learn more about all the deals in
the description now let's talk about
Xiaomi the company has definitely been
disrupting the market with its you know
really affordable smartphones that are
great quality and just great units
overall and now we hear that the company
is planning two devices for next year
which is tomorrow well at some point
next year that'll bring triple cameras
but we hear the interesting naming
schemes like the me makes nine and the
mimics four for example whatever the
case may be triple cameras or more
cameras are going to definitely reign
supreme stay tuned as we've got more
information on that now let's talk about
interesting dramas as well it seems that
the galaxy note 7 is not the only phone
that explodes if you remember recently
we covered that there was this device
this iPhone 10 that exploded after being
updated to iOS 12 now we've got the
second unit exploding now an iPhone
tennis max that happened in Columbus
Ohio the user had it in its pocket out
of the blue the phone too started
burning in two films and obviously cost
and burns and everything we're hoping
he's okay but definitely we'll see what
Apple responds to this
and speaking of not good news for
iPhones we've got Bank analysts now
predicting the future for iPhones bear
in mind we've heard Apple sell units in
the 70 millions in like forever for
years now and now we hear that they're
gonna get another drop in 10% in sales
which pretty much amounts to selling 40
million unit
this is the company doesn't want to
provide any numbers it is definitely
alarming for Apple considering the fact
that the iPhone makes 60 to 65% of their
business which is the main reason why
they don't want to provide numbers
anymore and why iPhones are getting so
expensive obviously the man has dropped
which is said and finally the hottest
news today have to do with nokia nokia
welcome to the hottest new segment you
deserve it if this nokia 9 PureView
device is a reality and so now we've got
famous tipster Evan blast showing as all
the goods we see a phone with I think
our five cameras in the back and a
sensor and a flash in addition we see a
front with bezels but I'm not gonna
complain about these they're better than
the knotch
I would assume we'll have to see the
final images in the end and still the
biggest question is what are the plans
for all these cameras codename of this
devices beholder so let us know in the
comments down below what exactly do you
think that Nokia is going to bring with
so many cameras because in my case
honestly it's Nokia man I mean the
company has innovated in camera
technology in like forever we hear that
the launch of this product is gonna be
January 10th which is the anniversary of
the company in Reverse so let's see what
we get but let us know in the comments
what you think will happen
