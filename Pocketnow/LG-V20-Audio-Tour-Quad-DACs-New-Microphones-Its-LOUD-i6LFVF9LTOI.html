mention audio as a brief side discussion
to our main first impressions and quick
comparisons in the V 20 LG is addressing
both the playback concerns we had with
the g5 and some of the audio capture
issues we faced with the v10 first those
microphones the V 20 retains the triple
microphone array which provides the
directional adjustments you can utilize
while shooting video this is an
extremely handy feature and new for the
V 20 LG is investing in mics with a
wider dynamic range gaining an
additional 15 decibels of Headroom over
the v10 to prevent clipping in loud
environment we weren't able to directly
test the extra Headroom for this
hands-on but we are looking to dig deep
during our real camera review we're also
curious to see if LG is still employing
aggressive audio noise reduction
filtering which can sometimes degrade
your audio in places with constant
background noise we are hopeful we'll
see some improvements there though as LG
has enough confidence in these new
microphones that the phone comes with a
phenomenal recording app for people to
capture adjust and edit waveforms making
the V 20 even more flexible as a tool in
a content creators arsenal moving over
to playback our initial impressions were
shot in a pretty noisy environment so it
was difficult coming to any conclusions
in judging speaker and headphone
playback between the v10 and the V 20
using both open back cans and the bno
inner aural earbuds we can at least
report that the V 20 is loud getting
anywhere near full volume was an
uncomfortable experience for this editor
LG is employing a somewhat unique signal
processing chain in this quad DAC
arrangement now we'll need to listen and
record in quieter environments to see
just what exactly is happening with
audio reproduction and what this
hardware is truly capable of but these
early impressions are very promising as
always thanks so much for watching be
