the HTC One I made I wrote an article
titled I was going to switch my iPhone
5s 20c want to mate but my arguments for
avoiding the change were based on the
for camera its lack of a fingerprint
scanner and the fact that boom sound was
in everything fast forward to today
giving me an HTC One m8 for a month and
now my iPhone 5s is in a drawer since a
lot of you asked me why this happened in
our reason after the buzz let's talk
about it I'm high never Iveta this is
PocketNow and these are the reasons why
I ditched the iPhone 5s for an HTC One
m8
I wish I could tell you that my reasons
for switching were based on hardware but
that's not the only reason HTC and Apple
signed the collaboration agreement years
ago and it's most apparent when you
compare these phones both devices have
anodized aluminum and both devices
support machine holes and chamfered
edges
despite their screen resolutions both
devices have great displays and great
color accuracy and if you took their
logos off you could say that one is just
the Big Brother of the other if size
were the only thing but yes the one I
made is massive compared to the iPhone
but curves of the back make it feel
comfortable and if we compared specs
alone on the other hand both devices
have flagship specifications and both
run their respective operating systems
like champs my biggest reason for liking
the HTC One m8 is because the placement
of everything makes more sense to me I
have big hands so for me five inches in
a display is perfect where the iPhone
looks tiny by comparison surely the
iPhone has a very good speaker but
that's the main problem it's only one
speaker
you simply can't compare it to the depth
and quality of boomsound speakers on the
One m8 and when you think about the fact
that these are front firing speakers
they're actually designed to enhance
your experience I guess that phrase
describes the difference between both
phones best the One m8 is designed to
enhance your overall experience with a
smart phone whereas the iPhone 5s is the
simplest form of a smart phone you take
your pick one of my biggest reasons for
switching is really in the software iOS
8 and 7 are the simplest form of how a
device should be operated that level of
simplicity is so basic that you find
yourself bumbling between applications
in a complex way to get a simple task
done what I love about HTC Sense 6 is
that again it enhances your overall
experience a contact card is not just
the contact card but a feat of
everything that you want to know about
that contact your photo gallery is not
just the feat of photos but actually a
photo gallery that intuitively gives you
photos and some expressions HTC TV is
not just the remote control application
but a service that actually helps me
organize the things that I want to see
being able to launch the camera with
gestures and go directly to blinkfeed or
unlock the
I mean sense is just more practical it
makes sense and it actually makes your
experience with the phone much better
it's that level of thoughtfulness that I
like about HCC sense
I mean iOS is cool it's reliable its
elegant and well thought-out but again
HTC Sense is just an added level of
usefulness that again enhances your
experience and makes me want to keep
using it my user experience is also a
reason to keep using the HTC One m8
though these reasons are slimmer it's
the basic things like the battery were
in the case of the one I made I can go
beyond the full day without charging and
in the case of the iPhone 5s I cannot go
beyond noon without looking for a
charger and that's really annoying
this battery issue really affects your
performance since even though both
devices run any game you throw at them
with ease you'll be able to play more
with the One m8 you'll also be able to
enjoy a more comfortable experience with
the bigger display on the One m8 and
feel more immersed because the speakers
are actually firing at you and not to
the side or behind you
and to make matters even more
competitive you simply can't consume
enough content without expandable
storage since in the case of the iPhone
you have to pay a lot of money if you
want more storage
now even with HTC's boomsound phone
calls are pretty much the same on both
devices whether through the earpiece or
through the speaker the difference lies
really when you're using the phone to
play a song through the speakers or when
you do what I do which is watch a lot of
YouTube videos it just makes more sense
to have the speaker's looking at you and
firing at you and interesting this even
happens through headphones as HTC
software does enhance your experience
with music and video a lot more through
headphones and through the speaker than
what you get with the iPhone the camera
is where things get tricky both devices
can record great video almost equal to
each other but the only scenario is
where the HTC One m8 is superior to the
iPhone 5s is one taking a photo because
it can do it much faster and number two
is the added software which enhances
your experience through Zoe the dual
camera effects and everything but surely
the One m8 has bigger pixels but so does
the iphone 5s though not as big as the
ates both take photos recently in low
light so really here's the deal
since I mostly used smartphones for
Instagram photos I'm okay with either
cameras though the 5 megapixel
wide-angle camera of the one I made is
better but if you want to really replace
a camera with your phone the iPhone will
be your best pick all the time and aside
from the camera and other things that I
do miss about the iPhone are things like
accessories where it's much easier to
find things for the iPhone than the One
m8 I particularly need a phone that's
waterproof for working out and sadly
neither of these phones are but there
are cases for the iPhone where as it's
really hard for you to find one for the
One m8 other than that be added half of
the One m8 can make it much more
complicated if you want to run for
example where hey it's not really that
bad it's just that obviously the iPhone
is much lighter and makes the experience
much more comfortable I won't deny that
I also miss the security of touch ID
though again these things have become
secondary for me after the other added
values that the one I made provides so
in conclusion switching from the iPhone
5s to the HTC One m8 was really a matter
of taste I prefer to get more for my
money and therefore excessive simplicity
isn't always for me both devices are
beautiful and reliable so I would rather
go for the one that gives me a more
enhanced experience that they were
priced accordingly but even that is
different I paid almost $900 for a 64
gig iPhone 5s compared to 650 for the 32
gig one m8 and then added $30 for 64
gigs of storage on a micro SD card so do
I need to say more the iPhone 5s is
still a great phone it is a great phone
for many people but the HTC want to made
a superior for me

reasons why I ditched the iPhone 5s for
the HTC One m8 she leave us a comment
