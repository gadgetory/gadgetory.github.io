tablet when you need it that's the idea
behind the new pad phone X from Asus and
AT&amp;amp;T and we have thoughts about the
combined phone and tablet dock in
another video published alongside this
one but if you're like us you're gonna
spend much more time going solo with the
more portable half so how well does it
hold up as a standalone smartphone quite
well in some ways not so well in others
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is our sous pad phone X video
review part 1 smartphone Edition a sous
didn't set out to change the world with
the pad phone X hardware like the two
generations before it the new handset is
a nondescript hunk of matte plastic with
almost nothing remarkable to set it
apart from the masses except for its
Asus logo which is still pretty novel to
see on a handheld device at 150 grams
it's a little on the chunky side given
the materials used in its construction
and with no curves or a clever
flattening on its tank-like body it
feels even thicker than its nine point
nine millimeter frame suggests while we
understand a degree of restraint in
design was required to build a phone
that would slide into a tablet dock
there's no getting around it the pad
phone itself is big bulky and aboutus
ordinary-looking as you can find under
the hood things get a little more
impressive a Snapdragon 800 backed up by
2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage is
augmented by a microSD memory card slot
supporting cards up to 64 gigs in size
18 T's 3G and 4G LTE bands are fully
supported along with Wi-Fi up to AC and
Bluetooth 4.0 which comes in handy if
you opt for the keyboard dock we'd talk
more about in the full review the
display up front is a 5-inch panel at a
very crisp 1080p resolution and like
most IPS screens it's capable of some
stunning saturation its pixel density
means it's sharp enough for even the
most discerning pixel counter but its
viewing angles aren't the best and it's
daylight readability leaves a lot to be
desired Android 4.4.2
is the OS that lives on that panel with
a special software layer from
that resembles its Zen UI aesthetically
some of the skin comes off nicely the
notification shade with its bright
whites and blues feels especially clean
and fresh but in other areas like home
screen widgets the effect is more
cartoony with a lot of wasted space and
a kind of beginners edition smartphone
feel a software update will be pushed to
devices before the official launch so we
won't comment on stability other than to
say it's good that an update is coming
because from the keyboard to the assuage
it's to multitasking to notifications
the pre-release software on our review
unit is very buggy on the back of the
pad phone sits a 13 megapixel
pixelmaster camera that lives up to its
ostentatious branding in some situations
the viewfinder with its various shooting
modes is a simplified version of what
you'll find in most modern smartphones
and the photos it produces in broad
daylight are acceptable on the plus side
colors are rich and the 13 megapixel
resolution gives you enough detail and
zoom ability to get the whole picture as
it were on the downside digital noise is
apparent in most shots probably thanks
to some artificial / sharpening and
that's especially true in the otherwise
handy HDR mode if noise is something
you're willing to live with and even if
it bothers you you'll still be impressed
by the pad phone's performance in near
darkness where it offers not one but two
shooting modes to get the most light in
low light mode confined you to less than
three megapixel shots which is kind of
annoying but it does crank the light up
to a ridiculous degree while night mode
provides a better middle ground letting
you keep your resolution and almost
always delivering a more balanced photo
each requires a steady hand when
shooting though so action shots at night
are out of the question without the
flash on the front side the 2 megapixel
selfie cam won't be winning any awards
but it comes with enough options to keep
you occupied on the video front 4k
recording is supported but we spent most
of our time shooting in 1080p which
isn't the best
frame rate is low enough to be annoying
when you're doing even slope hands and
the digital noise from the still section
is also evident here audio is muffled
and while auto exposure and focus seem
to work well colors are just a bit off
in some this is a camera you'll be happy
to have in low-light situations and as
with most smartphones it gets the job
done for a Facebook or Instagram photo
it offers easy to use software and
plenty of resolution but you wouldn't
want to count on it for a wedding and
even if you're just a guest
ATM T's LTE network delivers excellent
throughput in our Greater Boston
stomping grounds and the PadFone acts
had no trouble grabbing and maintaining
a 4G signal over our six days of testing
voice quality is just fine if a little
on the quiet side and noise cancellation
seems to do its job well over the
earpiece the speakerphone is quiet
though for notifications and for media
and located as it is on the back cover
it points the wrong way so you'll likely
take most handheld calls on the earpiece
or over the included earbuds those
earbuds are plenty comfortable and they
sound just fine too with the Snapdragon
800 it should come as no surprise that
the PadFone performs beautifully in
browsing and gaming popular titles like
asphalt 8 played wonderfully on the
1080p display with no hiccups or other
issues to report but with high-impact
graphics on a full HD display the
embedded 2300 milliamp hour battery has
a lot on its plate and despite the very
intelligent power management software
you'll probably have trouble getting
through a full day of heavy use on a
single charge you should remember that
this video review only covers half the
story the pad in PadFone is a crucial
component of this combo and our review
of the combined pair is live on youtube
right now but for the times you're out
and about with just the phone the
experience is dead smack in the middle
of average despite its heavy spec sheet
the pad phone is no blockbuster but
despite its shortcomings neither is it a
disaster
it's about as plain and Android flagship
as you can find which makes it fortunate
that it's priced as competitively as it
is and that it's capable of some really
neat tricks when docked with the other
half to see the other half of this
