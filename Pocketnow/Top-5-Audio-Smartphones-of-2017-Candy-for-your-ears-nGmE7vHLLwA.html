another solid year for smartphones
surveying the editorial staff at pocket
now we're ready to start detailing our
favorite phones of the year top features
best performance we're going to kick
things off with audio these are our
favorite multimedia performers of the
year this year Alcatel zidle returned to
a more modest price bracket but happily
did not sacrifice one of our favorite
features this design punches well above
the price tag and it's the best look
we've seen for including true
front-facing stereo speakers speakers
which handily compete against more
expensive options great audio hardware
rarely seen at this tier of the
smartphone market HTC had another rocky
year for sales and we'd be lying if we
said we weren't concerned with the U
series proprietary headphone adapter but
this company still impresses when it
comes to playing back your tunes with
dual speakers filling out your music
videos and games
HTC also showed off one of the coolest
tech tricks of the year nearly
instantaneous ear scanning to custom
tailor the phone's playback to your ears
it's a woefully underrated feature we
think music fans will really appreciate
Samsung is the number one phone
manufacturer in the world which was why
last year's phones were disappointing to
many listeners the galaxy s7 limping in
with a muffled speaker and mediocre
headphone performance the Galaxy s8 was
a welcome
about-face still delivering a mono
speaker but of noticeably higher quality
sammy also benefited from a radically
improved headphone DAC built into
Qualcomm's chipsets this year
catapulting the galaxies from near the
bottom of the pile to near the top of
the pack in one year a NASA doesn't hurt
that Samsung customers received some
excellent earbuds in the box with their
purchase Google was also a close
runner-up for Most Improved the pixel to
arriving with better speakers than its
predecessor it's the dongle which
actually makes this phone interesting
though visit after is a proper you
SB audio device recognized by phones and
computers and the DAC built into this
floppy little cable noticeably
outperforms the jack built into the
first pixel this dongle sets us on the
right path for us BC to take over as a
true consumer cabled audio standard
while simply being more convenient than
Apple's lightning adapter this $10 cable
might even be an upgrade for your laptop
and that brings us to the big kahuna the
LGV 30 while the mono speaker is
generally fine
you'll get the real ear candy when you
plug in some headphones higher quality
and cleaner playback than any other
phone this year and when you use some
nicer headphones you'll be treated to an
absolutely incredible amp it's the only
phone released in 2017 to deliver truly
audiophile hardware capable of hanging
with high-quality dedicated media
players many competing phones improved
this year but the v30 remains in a
league of its own and that's our list
for smartphone audio did your phone make
the cut do you think we missed anyone
drop us a comment down below as always
thanks so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for the rest
of our year-end best of lists next up
we'll be chatting smartphone cameras and
then all the editors will weigh in on
the top overall phones of 2017 you won't
want to miss it for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
