standpoint and maybe the less attractive
depending on your sense of style but
there's something to be said for
promptness I'm Michael Fisher with
pocket now and this is our unboxing of
the first to Android wear devices the LG
G watch and the Samsung gear live while
each of these watches has gotten its
fair share of time in the limelight the
LG product has been the better cover to
the tomb so let's start with the Samsung
gear live the box is very reminiscent of
the galaxy gear packaging no surprise
there and popping the seal on that box
reveals the gear live dead center
putting that aside for a box inventory
we're not surprised to find much else
included for 199 dollars just a charging
adapter the charger itself some warranty
information and a quick start guide
peeling the plastic film off the gear
live were struck by how much better it
feels than earlier gears it looks
similar on camera but in the hand it's a
simpler yet somehow more premium fit and
finish with a heart rate sensor on the
back cover and what feels like real
metal along the sides before we power on
the Samsung device let's see how LG has
opted to present its G watch pulling the
cover off reveals the more minimal
squared off watch face surrounded by a
much more exciting dazzling cardboard
seating plate we don't dislike Samsung's
packaging but by comparison LG has
definitely added a bit more pizzazz to
the unboxing process there are similar
accessories included for 229 with a
different cradle and cable configuration
but it all amounts to the same thing on
the night side LG did provide a screen
protector allowing for a nice new
product peel here quiet please holding
up side by side you can see how the
watch bands differ with LG taking the
more conventional route while Samsung
sticks with a similar design to the gear
fit it's the samsung watch we strap on
first and its initial boot goes by
quickly while we slept the G watch on
its magnetic charger but we do run into
a stumble we thought we'd try running
Android wear on the Moto G and the G
flex to provide a nice wide spectrum
between mid-range and high-end
but the g flex doesn't appear compatible
with the Android wear app fortunately
the Moto G has no such trouble and the
gear fit despite its packaging's
proclamation that it requires a galaxy
branded smartphone has no trouble
syncing up to the motorola device after
a quick tutorial we're good to go on the
gear live swiping cards and speaking
commands and while we can't immediately
replicate that success on the G watch
with the HTC One m8 we eventually get
things sorted out off camera just in
time to start setting up our Android
wear preferences for tomorrow's big
comparison we've got a lot of Android
wear coverage plan for this week besides
that comparison and two video reviews so
let us know what you want to see leave
us feedback in the comments below until
next time this has been michael fisher
with pocket now thanks for watching and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
