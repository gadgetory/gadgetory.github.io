Nexus and the new iPad you're probably
hung up on one of two factors ecosystem
or price nothing we say here will change
the fact that the Nexus 9 is about $100
cheaper and if you're already invested
in Apple's or androids walled garden the
decision is already made based on which
smartphone you're carrying again
probably but if you're thinking about
jumping platforms or if this will be
your first tablet there are a few
differences worth discussing I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
iPad air 2 versus Nexus 9 here does
nothing
if you're buying based on build well
there's no comparison here get the iPad
as we set in our full nexus 9 review HTC
makes beautiful smartphones but with
tablets
well when Google is calling the shots
the output is merely adequate the Nexus
9s soft touch coated plastic is more
durable and you'll feel less guilty
about beating it up but it shows smudges
more easily and the black version has a
lot of give to it from button travel to
fit and finish there's none of the
attention to detail that makes the
thinner sleeker iPad air - such a
pleasure to use the iPads screen is not
quite as sharp but it is larger and
while they're both IPS panels the iPads
anti-reflective coating makes it easier
to read in bright light while the Nexus
9 can be awakened with a handy DoubleTap
the ipad packs a fingerprint sensor
built into a tome key that lets you
unlock just as easily and adds a
different flavor of security in the
process the Nexus 9 does score some
points here it bears repeating that it's
more comfortable to use in the sense
that it's slightly smaller and you don't
worry as much about tossing it around
other advantages like HTC's signature
front firing speakers do give it more
traction and it's Tegra processor is
more powerful in some tests than the
iPads a 8 X but Android specs always
outshine apples and it seldom makes a
difference in real-world performance
plus the iPads speakers though side
firing can actually hold their own here
we prefer HTC's placement and added bass
yes the Nexus 9 wins this one no
question but the difference doesn't make
for a deal-breaker
in the tablet world hardware is less
than half the story Android lollipop is
version 5 of Google's mobile platform
while iOS is Apple's eighth revision
what we're trying to say is they're both
very refined if you're already an iPhone
owner you'll be much more at home with
the iPad and ditto in Reverse obvious
comparison is obvious in some ways the
Nexus 9 gets to make up ground against
the iPad here as always Android is more
adaptable than iOS because of things
like home screen widgets and a robust
sharing framework you can move into it a
little more fully and lollipop adds
flair to that utility with so many of
the little cosmetic touches that Android
ignored for years all that attention to
detail the Nexus 9 hardware lacks well
it's a nexus so Google has built it into
the software instead want to know the
weather or your appointments for the day
ask the Nexus 9 without even touching it
okay what's on my end of today you have
a calendar entry today at 7:30 p.m. the
title is real things
yeah the iPad can do that too but only
if it's plugged in and Siri is not as
smart as Google now what's the distance
to the Crosstown de Ferry Terminal in
New London
111 point the trial Google now itself is
also a great mix of relevant information
and borderline creepy predictive powers
and androids multiple user support means
sharing the Nexus 9 with a friend or
family member is much more customizable
than it is on the iPad and if you don't
like how android looks on the Nexus 9
you can use a variety of solutions to
change it again that's one of the big
strengths of Android where the iPad
shines brighter is in some new areas
like continuity which lets you carry
communications like phone calls and
texts across phone tablet and desktop
and that classic ecosystem advantage of
Apple's apps the App Store might be a
pain to navigate with its constant
password challenges and both the App
Store and the Play Store feature of
millions of titles but apples market
still packs more tablet optimized titles
than the Google Play Store does it's not
just optimization that keeps Apple on
top in the performance category the
company's top-down control of the whole
stack means that games for example have
to work on the new iPad to be listed in
the App Store
on the other side the Nexus 9s Tegra k1
processor is non-standard for Android
devices and that means that it's not at
all guaranteed to run every app you ask
it to this is the price Android pays for
having a more diverse Hardware ecosystem
and look it's worth it we love having
the choice that the Android world
provides but that'll come as little
comfort when all you want to do is play
a particular can't because if you're
powerful but in this case impotent
processor also if you're a real game or
media hound watch out you can only
download up to a 32 gig ceiling on the
Nexus meanwhile the iPad offers storage
options all the way up to 64 and 128
gigs which helps ease the sting of an
iCloud pricing plan
stuck in the Stone Age
if you take photos with your tablet well
good for you it's always nice to meet
someone who doesn't care what other
people think of them anyway you're not
going to come away terribly impressed by
the output of either but the iPad bears
a slight edge in quality the Nexus 9
brings an LED flash to the table though
so if you're taking tablet photos in the
club or the coalmine well that's your
ticket finally how about battery life
well iOS doesn't break down usage in
quite the same way Android does but it
doesn't matter endurance on each of
these is right in keeping with what
you'd expect of a full size tablet in
2014 and unlike in the smartphone world
that's good news
expect to get two to three days of
moderate to heavy use out of these Wi-Fi
only devices with each promising about
10 hours of continuous movie watching
web browsing or other mixed usage it's
always the same isn't it choose your
ecosystem then choose your hardware and
as close as these tablet platforms have
gotten to feature parity fundamentally
you're still looking at the same choice
a locked-down but consistent experience
versus a more open but less consistent
one if you're talking about platforms
there are a ton of reasons to choose
Android / io s but this is a comparison
specific to two particular tablets and
given the substantial gulf in the
hardware quality and general polish here
it's tough to recommend the Nexus 9 over
the iPad air 2 even given the hundred
dollar price difference if you're really
strapped for cash or you really prefer
Android of course go for the Google
tablet but for now but we think the iPad
air 2 is money better spent there's more
to learn about each of these tablets
