calm and this is our full review of the
samsung galaxy s 3 for 18 t if you
haven't already be sure to check out all
of our other galaxy s3 coverage in our
galaxy s3 playlist this time we've got
the pebble blue version let's check it
out galaxy s3 is one of the most
anticipated smartphones of the air and
if you add the blazing fast speeds of 80
s new LTE network turn for a good ride
let's start with the specs samsung
galaxy s3 ships with Android 4.4 and
does a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 1.5
gigahertz dual-core CPU with two gigs of
ram and 16 gigs of on-board storage with
a microSD slot for expansion the front
camera can take those at 1.9 megapixels
and video at 720p while the rear camera
is an 8 megapixel shooter with a flash
and can record Full 1080p video at 30
frames per second the Super AMOLED
pentile display is 4.8 inches at 1280 by
720 resolution making for a dpi of 305
the phone is quad band UMTS with LTE
support on ATT you also get Wi-Fi b/g/n
Bluetooth 4.0 a-gps digital compass and
NFC the phone is 133 grams and only
eight point six millimeters thick to
power it all you've got a 2100 milliamp
hour battery let's take a closer look at
hardware the design of the galaxy s3 is
the most unique I've seen from Samson in
recent years this is the pebble blue
version and we are very impressed with
its beauty there's no more weird lip on
the back as there was with the galaxy s2
and the plastic feels much more high
quality at the top we've got the handset
speaker along with some sensors a 1.9
megapixel front-facing camera and an LED
light it alerts you to certain
notifications which can be customized in
the settings then you've got a massive
4.8 inch screen
with a very thin bezel and at the bottom
is a hardware-based home button flanked
by passive back and many buttons to kind
of disappear to the body when the back
lights are off on the right side is a
small sliver of a power button on the
bottom you'll see the microphone hole
and a micro USB port on the left side is
a thin volume toggle button on the top
is the 3.5 millimeter headset jack and a
thin slot that you can use to pry the
battery cover off on the back is the 8
megapixel camera with a single LED flash
and speaker after prying off the back
you can see the 20 100 million per hour
battery as well as the microSD slot and
sim card slot the battery cover plastic
is very bendable one problem with the
beautifully designed hardware is that
it's glossy plastic is very sensitive to
fingerprints and also very slippery in
the hand the galaxy s3 is not as organ
AMA kaz it could be the thinness makes
it more difficult to hold since there's
less surface area on the edges for your
thumb and fingers to generate a stable
grip as is the case with all phones that
have large screens trying to reach the
upper areas of the screen is an exercise
in frustration if you only have one free
hand to interact with advice the most
comfortable way to use this device is to
hold it flat in the palm of your hand
letting gravity keep it there while
interacting with it using your other
hand in the pocket however the galaxy s3
is thinness is quite advantageous since
it does not cause too much bulk at all
now let's talk about the software one of
the first things I did was create a
better-looking wallpaper image since
most of the others were unimpressive
though there are some interesting live
wallpapers included there's one that
animates news stories in the wallpaper
background and one that shows stock
quotes we like the one that shows photos
from the photo gallery but we dislike
that we have to manually select a
hundred of them and it crops most images
in the worst ways possible the default
widgets aren't terribly attractive
either the weather clock widget has a
goofy lens flare in the corner that
doesn't even come from the Sun shone in
the same graphic we've also got a few
other default widgets on the other home
screens that some might consider
bloatware though others might find them
useful the exception is Flipboard widget
which we liked a lot the flute
app is quite a good-looking way to flip
through news stories by default are
numerous seemingly superfluous apps
included that are sure to confuse some
users for example there's apps called
messages messaging and messenger in the
app tray there's also chat on and talk
which are a couple more messaging apps
and the talk app lets you do pretty much
the same thing as the messenger app with
the same people then you've got play
music and music player which share
similar functions and then the same
thing you've got play movies and TV
which has functions that overlap the
video player app it's fun trying to
remember all the differences though
Samson has also included a secondary
video store called the media hub that
duplicates functions of the play movies
and TV app but sometimes gives you
different prices in case you want to
bargain shop s memo is a decent
note-taking and dry nap that also
supports voice recording and syncs with
your Samson account as suggests is just
another way of discovering apps all it
does is link you to the Google Play
Store to download apps that Samson
decides to feature then there's s voice
which is a nice attempt to adding a new
speech interface of the galaxy s3 but it
falls short of being that terribly
useful the deal breaker for us is the
fact that it won't read incoming text
messages you can send text messages
without looking at the phone sure but
when someone replies you have to pick it
up and reate yourself in terms of
interesting customizations Samsung has
added quite a few features many of which
might never catch on and do not have any
usability advantage whatsoever for
example the one where you hold a finger
on the lock screen for a couple seconds
while holding your phone up and then you
rotate it to launch the camera that's
way too convoluted the one where you
simply find a contact and then hold the
phone up to your ear to dial without
pressing a dial button it's actually
very cool that brings us to the keyboard
just like Brandon and Michael I found
this autocorrect feature to be horribly
frustrating you'll want to install a
better keyboard like swipe or swiftkey
next let's look at the camera the galaxy
s3 is able to use its LED
auto focus assist which is important for
getting sharp photos in low-light
unfortunately the AF assist feature
makes for a significant increase in
shutter lag since it doesn't attempt to
focus until after you press the shutter
button unless you touch the screen to
set it focus point first in that case
light will come on for focusing and then
it'll shut off without taking picture
but then pressing the shutter button
will be faster not having a dedicated
camera button for half press focusing
and full press shutter makes this
process more difficult and more likely
to miss the shot though for still
objects it works well low-light shots
tend to be well exposed however the
amount of noise is very high outdoors
the camera is quite good and boasts some
fun optional shooting modes and a lag
free shutter while we love the idea of
the panoramic shooting mode samson's
implementation doesn't work well at all
seams and duplicate shapes are are too
frequent compared to HTC's panoramic
shooting mode for example be sure to
look at our full review on pocketnow.com
full resolution sample photos from the
galaxy s3 in terms of battery life we
found the galaxy s3 to be quite good we
could easily last all day and we're
getting around 20 hours worth of normal
usage LTE speeds on 18 T's network were
phenomenal if coverage is available in
terms of pricing and availability you
can now buy the galaxy s3 from ATT for
199 with a 2-year contract and
qualifying rate plan many of our
annoyances are software related and thus
can be fixed by the developer community
so if your power user who likes to
install different roms try out all sorts
of hacks and do some heavy customizing
you're sure to like this phone our final
rating is 4 out of 5 stars the galaxy s3
is a great device for android fans who
want the latest hardware with lots of
room to grow be sure to check out our
galaxy s3 playlist on YouTube for much
more coverage and comparisons on this
device don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching
