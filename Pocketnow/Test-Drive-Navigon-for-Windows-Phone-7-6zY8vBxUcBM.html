we've got navigon for windows phone
installed right here so let's take for a
spin okay before we start navigon let's
see if it integrates with anything like
Bing so here's a Bing Map location of a
restaurant and we can see sometimes apps
integrated with it like there's a
reserve button that open table at it so
let's swipe to the apps and we do not
see anything for navigon so if you're
looking for a location in vain it's not
going to be easy to get it into have
gotten I can copy this but let's see how
we get into nav gun here's our warning
so let's enter an interest and if I
paste it's not going to do that very
well because it's looking for just the
city so you have to delete that and
delete that
and then maybe you'll get that and now
you have to get the street so it's kind
of a pain because we gotta delete it
with an ear and maybe a little fun well
it's not even to find the street so I
gotta delete the number so this is kind
of a pain but now I can finally go there
and here's your map and here's your
options I can save it to the I can pin
it to the Start menu I can send the
destination to text message or email
there's my favorites and I can press
play and even that hasn't started the
navigation instructions yet I have to
choose which route I want
and now it's turn left onto ardsley
avenue east so this is hooked up to my
stereo with bluetooth so i'll be able to
hear it now you're probably going to
want to know does it work in the
background so right up ahead I'm
supposed to make a left turn hey let's
listen to it again in 150 feet at the
t-junction turn left onto ardsley avenue
east so let's see how that works but i'm
going to go to a different out first
alright so here we're driving
and I'm coming to the intersection I'm
going to go right instead of left
because it's holding the left but I
didn't say anything
so it does not run in the background I
go back to it it's going to reload
and it recalculates my instructions to
washington avenue so that's actually
okay it'll uh recalculate your
destination pretty quickly in 400 feet
finally track Randleman Road so let me
pull over again and show some other
things this seems like a good spot turn
right onto Roland road so there's that
let's go back to the home screen there
we are so my destinations is a place
where it saves reasons and favorites so
you can have quick access to those you
can also reap in them so when they're in
there you can pin to the start menu for
quick access you can get contacts but
every time it has to reload your whole
contact list like this so you got to
wait a minute for it to be able to
search I'm not even going to wait I'm
going to go back coordinates is just
going to show me where I am okay if we
swipe over here we get points of
interest so we can choose a nearby
and we can just choose all categories
and it's going to load stuff that's
nearby so you can see everything there
and choose whatever you want can also
sort by category of course
and you have quick access
let's see settings
so settings 3d map
red light cameras
traffic
now here's the reality scanner
we don't have any points of interest but
they should show up on the screen which
is pretty cool okay so here we are a
point of interest settings this is where
we can choose which ones show up on the
home screen you got your GPS info make
sure it's working and if you just want
to look at the map while you drive you
got that and down here we have traffic
information you also want to see if the
music plays while we're driving so let's
try that
now turn right onto rolling road and you
probably heard that it does right there
however the voice is not louder than the
music
so it's kind of hard to hear while
you're playing music let's play it again
that it doesn't lower the volume of the
music so that I can hear the voice
instructions every time like some of the
older ones from you know 2003 used to
work
in a way that's navigon offline maps
work nicely when you don't have to
download everything although all the
time you don't have to be connected all
time so you can rely on having maps in
your device which is great and it works
pretty good as long as you're in the
program while watching so give us a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this video of
navigon for Windows Phone and that's it
for now
