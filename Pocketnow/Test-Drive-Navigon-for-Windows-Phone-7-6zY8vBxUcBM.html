we've got Navigon for Windows Phone and
spelled right here so let's take for a
spin okay before we start Navigon let's
see if it integrates with anything like
Bing so here's a Bing map location of a
restaurant and we can see sometimes apps
integrated with it like there's a
reserve button that open table at it
so let's swipe to the apps and we do not
see anything for Navigon so if you're
looking for a location in vain it's not
going to be easy to get it into I've got
I can copy this but let's see how we get
it into napkin
there's our warning so let's enter an
interest and if I paste it's not going
to do that very well because it's
looking for just the city so you have to
delete that and delete that
and then maybe you'll get that and now
you have to get the street so it's kind
of a pain because we got a delete
everything here and maybe a little fun
well it's not even the finalists Street
so I got a good number so this is kind
of a pain but now I can finally go there
and here's your map and here's your
options I can save it to the I can pin
it to the Start menu I can send the
destination to text message or email
there's my favorites and I can press
play and even that has the start of the
navigation instructions yet I have to
choose which route I want
and now it's on to only Avenue East so
this is hooked up to my stereo with
Bluetooth so I'll be able to hear it
now you're probably going to want to
know does it work in the background so
right up ahead I'm supposed to make a
left turn
let's listen to it again 150 feet at the
t-junction turn that on to only Avenue
East so let's see how that works but I'm
gonna go to a different out first
all right so here we're driving
and I've coming to the intersection I'm
gonna go right instead of left because
it's holding the left but I didn't say
anything so it does not run in the
background I go back to it it's gonna
reload
and it recalculates my instructions so
that's actually okay
it'll recalculate your destination
pretty quickly so let me pull over again
and show some other things this seems
like a good spot so there's that now
let's go back to the home stream there
we are
so my destinations is a place where it
saves reasons and and favorites so you
can have quick access to those you can
also repin them so when they're in there
you can pin into the Start menu for
quick access you can get contacts but
every time it has to reload your whole
contact list like this so you got to
wait a minute for it to be able to
search I'm not even going to wait I'm
gonna go back coordinates is just gonna
show me where I am okay if we swipe over
here we get points of interest so we can
choose a nearby
and we can just choose all categories
and it's gonna load stuff that's nearby
so you can see everything there and
choose whatever you want you can also
sort by category of course
and you have quick access
let's see settings
so settings 3d map
red-light cameras
traffic
now here's the reality scanner
we don't have any points of interest but
they should show up on the screen which
is pretty cool okay so here we our point
of interest settings this is where we
can choose which ones show up on the
home screen you got your GPS info make
sure it's working
and if you just want to look at the map
while you drive you got that and down
here we have traffic information you
also want to see if the music plays
while we're driving so let's try that
now turn right Mountain Louisville and
you probably heard that it does right
there
however the voice is not louder than
music
so it's kind of hard to hear while
you're playing music let's play it again
figure that it doesn't lower the volume
of music so that I can hear the voice
instructions every time like some of the
older ones from you know 2003 used to
work
anyway that's Navigon offline maps work
nicely when you don't have to download
everything although all the time you
don't have to be connected all the time
so you can rely on having maps in your
device which is great and it works
pretty good as long as you're in the
program while watching so give us a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this video of
Navigon for Windows Phone and that's it
for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
