their analysis over the pricetag of the
iPhone 8 huawei has begun to tease its
mate ten and call this the beyond galaxy
time we get leaks of the Samsung gear
sport and that's about it
I'm Jaime Rivera and even though I've
been sleep-deprived for the last couple
of days it is time to celebrate Friday
this is PocketNow daily the official
dish that I begin with interesting
developments as blackberry continues
their Phase two of changes obviously TCL
will continue to handle the company's
hardware division but when it comes to
software it seems that Blackberry plans
to actually port their more secure
version of Android to other OEMs how
will that look or will this be the
BlackBerry version of Android or
whatever is very hard to predict but
given the success of Amazon with its
Kindle Fire lineup this could definitely
be a good idea now it's talking about
the Samsung gear sport I mean I was
definitely looking forward to a gear s4
or whatever but from some recent leaks
images it seems that the only thing
we're getting at Aoife is the gear sport
and this is a version 3 of Tizen we're
obviously expecting these updates to
reach the current gear smartwatches but
hopefully this is not the only
SmartWatch that we get to see it Aoife
it would be really disappointing I was
will the spotlight over the Huawei
definitely we've spent the last couple
of weeks talking only about the node 8
and now that it's official the company
claims that it's May 10 which is going
to be announced on October 16th is going
to be the time beyond Galaxy apparently
product that's better than the Galaxy
Note 8 it's gonna be very interesting to
see exactly what Huawei pulls here
mainly because I do know that the
cameras on that thing should most
probably be superior the Mait 9 is
already superior in many ways to most of
the smartphone cameras out there let's
see what we get now about the HTC
corporation we hear some major changes
to come and even though HTC has claimed
that it's not going to sell its
smartphone division we've got some sort
of is claiming that the company is
considering selling it survive the
vision and it all makes sense the vibe
is a very complex product definitely
more complex than absolutely any other
VR platform out there and by complex I
don't mean
volute I actually mean this is the most
complete you can buy and definitely
people haven't really bought it like
hotcakes because it's not cheap cheaper
than we expected but not cheap at all so
the question is exactly what is going to
happen to HCC after that because the
company was bidding a lot on VR
and finally the very interesting rumors
today come from sources that claim that
the iPhone 8 will definitely cost in
$9.99 on its launch apparently we are
getting the iPhone 7s the iPhone 7s plus
and these will be the entry-level
iPhones at current prices but the higher
tier no holds bar new technology iPhone
8 will start at 64 gigabytes of storage
and will be yeah $1000 at launch and
this is rather interesting I mean the
Galaxy Note 8 currently costs crazy
amount of money nine hundred sixty
dollars on certain carriers you know the
question today would be how do you feel
about companies you know pricing their
flagship smartphones already scratching
$1000 I mean it's not like if the
economy is getting any better so I
wonder exactly what the whole purpose of
this would be leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
