are already official with lots of
products and microsoft sets another nail
at their zune coffin i'm high memory
better and this is parking out daily
Aoife IFA call it whatever you want our
team is there live providing you with
the best hands on coverage but what's
probably your next smartphone or tablet
but the biggest news today was Samsung
they brought out a lot of products first
of all the samsung galaxy note 2 which
we were expecting but interesting here
is the fact that the device is actually
bigger sexier and even more powerful in
its predecessor if that's even possible
the device is clearly a power house and
to me it's probably the most powerful
smartphone in the market at least for
today then they brought out their
Samsung Galaxy camera which is a 16
megapixel camera powered by Android I
still debate whether the camera is good
or not but you'll be the judge of that
then they've brought their new at Eve
lineup and I wish somebody could explain
what that means but that signifies their
new Windows products so they've gotten a
teeth tablet that will provide you
windows 8/rt and also windows a
professional and different variants that
you want and also they brought out there
a teeth s which is the first Windows
Phone 8 product to be launched in the
market or at least announced the device
is extremely sexy it's pretty much a
samsung galaxy s3 on a windows phone
operating system we have no dates no
prizes yet but we can definitely give
you some hands on coverage very soon so
was another big player which brought out
their new smartphone lineup which has
the Xperia T which is also the TX
they've got the xperia v and the xperia
j and you can already sense that they're
running out of letters in the alphabet
but the vices are really good they're
really nice and design but sadly no
quad-core devices or android 4.1 jelly
bean this year is kind of unforgivable
now we've got the Sony Xperia Tablet S
which has a beautiful design quad-core
processor again they're reusing letters
but no jelly bean and then they've got
the sony vaio duo 11 which we recently
leaked a very nice device convertible
when
Jose tablet among other products sell
he's bringing a lot of really cool stuff
but I'm really not going to bore you
with specs because we're going to have a
lot of hands on about these devices and
just hit the link in the description for
all the details of these devices that
are being released and out of those
silent announcements we also got LG
after releasing their optimus G now also
offering a budget-friendly optimus l9
which I'm not even going to waste your
time giving you specs because don't
recommend but then we've also got some
leaked images of a possible nokia device
that will be released at IFA orisha and
hopefully this device will be nice
though I'm not really a fan of yellow I
don't know about you but still the irony
is nokia people having these signs
saying samsung welcome back to Windows
Phone out of the Samsung keynote event
when I think Nokia forgot that Samson
got to Windows Phone first we also ran
into some leaked images of an HTC
mysterious tablet and I mean mysterious
because this looks nothing like anything
you've ever seen it could probably be
just the concept of ice but you'll
notice that the bezel is completely
different on one side than the other it
doesn't look like any tablet in the
market but it actually looks more like
an apple imac you know with the long
bezel at the bottom of the small bezel
at the top you've got the cameras
inverted at the bottom instead of the
top and it just looks like a really
weird device it could probably be a
prototype and hopefully we will see a
tablet coming out this year from hcc we
all miss the HTC Flyer and wish please
wish that HTC will bring more of their
devices tablets at least to the market
and finally on a sad note Microsoft is
sent a memo to their zoom past
subscribers letting them know that
they'll be losing a couple of features
as of next month one of the most
controversial once is the fact that if
you upgrade to a new pc like if you
won't do with windows 8 coming out
you'll sadly lose all your music and all
your videos that you purchase you can
reactivate them redownload them you
can't do anything it just kind of
reminds me of why I got so upset at
Microsoft when they canceled Microsoft
reader back in Windows Mobile when I had
already purchased like 80 ebooks and I
didn't get any alternatives which leads
me to the question of the day do you
think it's fair that Microsoft just
cancel services out of the blue and
doesn't give you alternative options
don't you think it's fair that you get
what an amazon gift card
something where you can repurchase these
things again leave a comment down below
