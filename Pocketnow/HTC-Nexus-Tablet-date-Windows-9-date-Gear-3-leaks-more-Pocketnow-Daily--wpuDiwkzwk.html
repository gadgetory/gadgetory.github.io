just a month away credible sources are
talking of Windows 49 and Windows Phone
94 September and we get the first
details of the Samsung gear 3 I'm hi
Mary bet I and how about have you
planned the jokes for next week leave us
a comment and I'll pick the top five
this is parking out daily and I guess
we're gonna have to forget about the
official news and talk about the Moto X
plus one even though famous tipster
efflux was retired it seems that he
found some very interesting renders of
the Moto X plus 1 and these match
exactly with the other vendors that we
had seen before so this is clearly what
design we can expect and we know that we
should be expecting this phone in the
next couple of weeks and the motorola
event just hoping that motorola for the
first time brings us a much better
specifications according to the rumors
even though we're still wondering what
that modal pork is I'll sorry about the
samsung gear 3 yes we've got an
exclusive here on what to expect from
this SmartWatch in the future number
what it seems that curve displays were
going to be the thing so expect that to
come and the gear 3 that we don't have
any specific dates in addition to a new
home button that is apparently going to
be more useful than the current one
that's kind of hard to press but even
more interesting is the fact that
apparently Samsung will continue with
Tizen even though we have Android wear
today it seems that Samsung wants to
continue its own thing and hopefully
give us a variant that's going to focus
on Android wear but yet Tyson is going
to be the deal yes it's only going to
work on galaxy phones as it currently
does unless you tweak it let's see what
we get we should be expecting this gear
3 who knows probably any fun one of the
biggest confusions we have when it comes
to rumors is the Nokia Lumia 830
remember that the 820 was a mid-tier
phone and as it turns out we got some
more league documents and photos of the
lumia a 30 showing as a replaceable
battery and a huge camera bump sort of
the one like we see on the Lumia 1020
which makes us wonder if Nokia is
planning to pull a samsung you know the
K zoom is actually a galaxy s5 mini with
a big camera so it could it be that
they're not bringing flagship specific
Asians to the next camera phone from
nokia let's hope that's not the case as
we do love the 1020 now it's all about h
DC and Google as we keep hearing more
rumors of an HTC nexus tablets Merrilee
this is the t1 we've heard this code
name before but even more interesting it
seems that we should expect this tablet
to be announced before october nine i
don't know exactly why october nine is
special but it seems that number one
that will be the close to launch date a
number to android l would be fully
unveiled then on this tablet just like
the Nexus 7 has done in previous times
so yeah probably we already know when
Android L is going to hit the market
october nine and see and finally for the
hot rumors of the day let's talk about
microsoft and windows and i know this
hasn't reached the hot news of the day
and ages there are reasons for that
people didn't really like windows 8 and
windows 8.1 even though cool hasn't
garnered enough praise from the market
and as it turns out it seemed that the
company is preparing for a launch or at
least an announcement closed beta
announcement to developers on September
30th for windows 9 we're expecting them
to get rid of charms bar a new start
menu among other features that might be
launched you're including Cortana but
even more interesting it seems that this
event we will also be seeing the merger
between Windows RT and Windows Phone 9
now we're not really sure if 9 is going
to be the moniker for this new version
of the operating system we're just
assuming here we should expect this to
happen at the events but we already know
what Microsoft dozen times they tell you
this is the new version of Windows and
they don't give you a number or a name
but that leads me to the question of the
day what would be your wish list for
windows 9 in order for you to either
continue buying windows instead of going
to a Mac or you know to go back to
windows because in my case oh my god you
know I would love to see windows seven
again the whole UI windows 7 was better
I feel that OS 10 has done a much better
job at involving especially with the way
it connects with the iphone in the ipad
now with the whole continuity thing on
iOS 8 and Yosemite so I wish to see
something like this with Windows Phone
there has to be a value when owning a
Windows Phone and the windows computer
there has to be a purpose between that
and there isn't any right now but leave
comment down below what do you think
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming she follow us I'm
talking out comment subscribe to channel

video thumbs up if you liked what you

much for watching we'll see you next
