this is not an antenna this is for the
TV in South Korea I met behind a camera
we're with LG and looking at the G throw
to family so let me be the first one to
make not one but four fingerprints on
the screen because this new knock knock
or knock on technology recognizes
thousands of nikon's this particular one
knocks on like this one two three four
boom of course with the g2 you would
have only double tapped on it without
waking up but this can be broken up by a
lot of key combinations that
combinations and this is the samsung
galaxy note 3 competitor for 2014 on
bill eva at least when the nose por will
arrive this has got a 5.9 inch display
which has a full HD resolution and i'm
not sure we should go beyond that though
some might say that this diagonal would
have called for at least a 2k resolution
but that doesn't matter behind the glass
there's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor clocked at two point when t 60
Hertz close to two point three which is
of course a quad-core processor we got
32 gigabytes of internal storage
expandable via microSD card and let me
push the antenna back there we go and
helping the processor out as 3 gigabytes
of RAM we're at the back because the
back features a 13-megapixel camera
optically stabilized it is exactly the
same system as on the g2 a little bit
improved on the sensor side but what LG
did is take the optical image
stabilisation further and added an extra
layer of software stabilization to it
and here is the speaker which LG claims
to be one of the best speakers on a
mobile phone this is actually one watt
speaker according to the official blog
post from about two weeks ago there's
also LED flash and the signature buttons
for power on volume up volume down or
whatever else you can customize as you
can see this is LTE advanced for LG U+
in South Korea the global varietal not
have the antenna and probably this
inscription right here else we are
looking at android and the specific
version of android operating on this
phone is software information for 242
which is the latest with LG's proprietor
user interface on top of it and I can
tell you this much it is really fluid
and this is probably LG's clipboard like
take on whatever Samsung uses for their
news feeds customizing the home screens
for up to you know the drill up to 2 I
can't count regardless you can come guys
we have the notification tray with the
same old cues cloud applications it's
not multi window we don't have a stylist
like we have on the note free but you
can use your finger to write on the
screen or to do annotations now the
battery operating inside it is a 3200
milliamp hour battery which is
interesting because this is a much
larger device than for instance the
Xperia z2 which has the exact same
capacity for its battery I wish we could
test out the speaker just to see if LG's
planes are right but in this
noisy condition and environment we will
not be able to do that stay tuned we'll
have a video right after this comparing
the g pro two what is that wreck
competitor the Galaxy Note 3 I have an
aunt on having behind the camera thank
you very much for watching this was
pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
