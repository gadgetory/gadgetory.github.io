speaking out because he found a Wi-Fi
bridge we need an app to keep track of
where in the world hime is traveling to
next whenever you find the app you let
me know because I'm gonna need a copy I
made a vet a pro is real featuring more
rollin ours in the name and one size
smaller t-shirts so one that'd be like
extra small hi Matt this is the face of
get a flight slash Monday slash no sleep
leave it out yeah I think you
encapsulated it great that's right it is
that time of the week I'm home it'll be
better this is PocketNow reporting from
Aoife in GBC let's go through your
comments for last week
and this is Aoife GPC which is happening
in Huelva Spain and I know IVA is an
event that happens in Berlin every
September but they have their global
press conference happening in different
parts of the world every year this year
it's happening here it's a beautiful
place
and it's an opportunity to get to meet
their partners get to meet some of the
new brands that are coming new products
that are coming and where the trends are
going for us is probably one of our
favorite events for me it's probably one
of the biggest learning experiences in -
where the markets are going what is
selling what it's not helps us make a
lot of educated decisions over where the
travel should go as well let's begin
with your comments I know this is the
horrible face of jet lag but on Monday
the discussion was all about the Galaxy
Note n is you about the recent leaks we
had no 10 no 10 Pro asked you what you
wanted to see we had 350 comments Brits
will be named the pro it needs to have
12 gigs of RAM one terabyte of base
storage 120 Hertz refresh rate and no
bezels with a camera and the s-pen cup
I'm still debating over what a camera
and the s-pen would mean but yeah
definitely if it's gonna be called the
pro it should have monster
specifications but also in addition to
the s-pen I wish that after testing the
Galaxy fold I wish that it had other
elements to it to make it more useful
for professionals the Galaxy Note 7 Pro
is going to have to S pen's
that's probably not going to happen but
I wish that there was support for other
types of s fens I mean there are rumors
that Apple is working on a new variant
of the Apple pencil that's going to have
different tips I wish that Samsung did a
little more of that note 10 Pro might
just bring a bigger battery boost clock
slightly higher more RAM and bigger
display you know I hope that that's not
the case Huawei has been using the pro
moniker correctly you can do more
grow things with their phones I think
that LG should do the same with their V
Lynaugh they should call these the probe
you can do a lot better stuff so we're
hoping that that's not the case then on
Tuesday the topic was the iPhone 11 the
rumors that the a 13 chip is already
gonna make the jump to the six nanometer
chip whether even though I believe it's
gonna happen until the following year
and I asked you I mean what do you think
about all the possibilities of
everything you can pack into this chip
we had 385 comments but such a powerful
ship they might as well risk it with a
more complicated OS give us note like
functions oh my god particularly with
the iPad I hope they finally do make it
a pro all that power and still no sign
of split-screen multitasking feature
what's the use yes that we only iPads do
that even if not perfectly yes what
screen picture and picture more
integrated AI and customization you know
I think that it's time for Apple to
realize that iOS worked well in 2007 and
up to a certain point we need something
more transcending now and we're back in
our hotel room because now we have to go
to a gala and it's really hot here yeah
651 comments over the Galaxy phone
breaking I asked you what you thought
about all the events let's just wait and
see how things unfold I'll show myself
out indeed I can't wait to get my
replacement unit they weren't supposed
to peel the screen protector though it
wasn't a screen protector so yeah two of
the cases were more like user error I'm
no engineer but I kind of saw this
coming
same and it's mainly because the more
moveable parts you have in a product the
more opportunity for failure but on
Thursday the topic was the iPhone 11 we
hear that there are improvements to the
camera and provements to the code I
asked you if that would make you want to
buy an iPhone 11 we had 399 comments as
long as there's no camera humph I think
I'll be fine with the stove looking
camera setup oh my god it looks horrible
but if that thing we're flush firing
more cameras on iPhones means
record-breaking price tags
record-breaking price tags yes
I hope not need a wider selfie camera
periscope at the back actually
budget-friendly I don't think those
things are gonna go together buddy
and then finally Friday the topic was
Qualcomm and Apple the fact that both
companies have finally decided to work
together my ask you what have you
thought about that you know companies
making up as we also saw Google and
Amazon doing the same we had 427
comments Apple hey Qualcomm you charge
too much for licensing cocom we learn
from the best
Apple Touche take our money all right
best comment of the week Apple will pass
the cost to their consumers not a
problem for Tim Cook at all that is so
true in today's day and age Apple would
be dead without call comp until is years
behind and Apple can't simply afford to
be behind competitors at the moment
indeed and in the race for 5g that's
just where it is Qualcomm has invested
so much in this that's it for the
parking our daily recap thank you so
much for watching if you want your
comments to be featured keep them short

thumbs up it helps us spot on a lot
easier you also follow us on social
medias descriptive of our channels
