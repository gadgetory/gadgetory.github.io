an AT&amp;amp;T a nokia tablet seems to be like
the next best thing and sorry guys angry
birds space is not planning to come to
Windows Phone all this and more coming
up right now hello everyone I'm Jaime
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
Windows Phone view the show we wrap up
all this week's good and bad inside the
world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's write this week off of
what's good the Nokia Lumia 900 is
probably one of the most anticipated
windows phones of the year it incarnate
the LTE Windows Phone powerhouse that
we've been waiting for and we had some
time to play with it at CES at mwc so
you know that we're all geared up and
waiting for the device to be out to
review it and give you the full coverage
that you're expecting now it's
interesting to see that AT&amp;amp;T apparently
has everything ready to launch a device
on april 9th so prepare your wallets and
you can bet that we will be seeing a lot
more of this phone coming up because it
seems that AT&amp;amp;T is planning to give
their employees of free Lumia 900 to
play with so I'm glad to see that
they're now taking seriously how they
have to sell the phone because in the
past you don't even see when those
phones and sales stores aside from
dummies so really good news speaking of
Nokia they recently committed to
providing certain features that are not
available in Lumia models in the market
first of all is the wireless hotspot
feature that we saw advertised on the
Lumia 610 kind of a no-brainer not sure
why that's not available yet and second
is made of panorama photo mode in camera
settings and just the wireless hotspot
feature alone as a deal-breaker for many
people I mean hey that's the only reason
why I'm rocky an HTC Titan and not a
Lumia 800 so let's hope they have these
features out on the market soon because
we have no date so far out of this
week's coverage make sure you catch Adam
lanes recent editorial regarding the no
kick concept redesign for windows phone
it's from it a lot of controversy
because Nokia acknowledges it and says
that they're entitled to tweak Windows
Phone however they want but microsoft
says otherwise so i kind of don't like
it just hit the link in the description
look at the redesign and tell us what
you think on the comments down below and
aside from that make sure you also catch
his recent coverage on project Detroit
which is a sort of
merger for Windows Phone and Windows 8
tablets to play with cars kind of nice
and speaking of controversy we were all
kind of underwhelmed with Microsoft's
limit of five applications running in
the background in mango and interesting
enough we came with some recent ROM
images that show Windows Phone tangle
which is supposed to be for low-end
phones running as much as eight
applications at the same time so
hopefully this is some sort of just
mango limit and apparently we will be
getting tango on every device not
necessarily the low-end smartphones and
hopefully that will allow us to have
more applications running in the
background because if tango can do it
why not mango and what about Windows 8
tablets what seems that as markets keep
converging as technology keeps evolving
tablets or the next best thing and nokia
has plans to bring a tablet to the
market their chief of design recently
came on record to state that a tablet
design has gotten busy completely so it
seems that Nokia will provide a tablet
eventually now we have no release date
so the earliest we can expect this when
the plan launch date for Windows 8 is
which is pretty much around the fall so
it seems like the next possibility and
for those of you that consider it odd
for nokia to bring a tablet to the
market just remember that Nokia started
as a paper company back in the 19th
century so why not
that does it for what's good let's
continue on with what's bad and probably
the worst news of the week is the fact
that rovio just stated that they will
not be providing angry birds space to
the windows phone marketplace according
to them the numbers are not big enough
for them to be putting their resources
into developing another gay man it's
kind of a bad situation because first of
all we all know that Microsoft has
provided some really good tools support
iOS and Android applications to Windows
Phone quite easily it's kind of a
no-brainer but it seems that and call as
a personal rent I think that the low
numbers and sales at the windows for
marketplace have nothing to do with the
amount of customers or the amount of
apps being available the apps are good
but the problem is it's four times more
expensive to buy an application on
Windows Phone and an Android I mean
angry birds and Android is free in some
cases it only costs one buck and then on
the iOS App Store it also costs just one
dollar so why should you be paying 299
or 399 for angry birds on the windows
phone marketplace and pay less money on
other platforms I think that it has to
do with the business model and before
you die hard fans come up to me and say
that hey the business baller has to deal
with the fact that there are less
customers and Windows Phone just cut the
excuses I feel that and remember that
back in the day when there was no App
Store no marketplace for Android hey
Angry Birds cost the same dollar that it
cost now it has nothing to do with the
amount of customers it has everything to
do with the platform and the owner of
the platform this time being Microsoft
controlling the prices of not they're
not going to push applications in the
windows phone marketplace and therefore
you're not going to be selling more
phones that really has to change again
that's a personal round of mine leave a
comment down below and tell us what you
think about why applications are more
expensive in the windows phone
marketplace compared to other platforms
what's the reason that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high metal you better remember to
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
