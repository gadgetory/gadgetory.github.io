phone 8 development Windows Phone 7
mango rtm gets leaked and Microsoft
canceling their reader ebook division
all the two more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi Mary veteran with
pocketnow.com and welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we go through all
this week's good and bad inside the
world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's start this week off with
the good well with news of Windows Phone
7 mango and tango in the mix it's
interesting to see Microsoft already
working on their Apollo project which is
Windows Phone 8 there's already a job
posting out there for engineers to
become part of the developer program of
Windows Phone 8 and it seems very
enthusiastic now Windows Phone 7 was
launched in fall of last year windows
phone 7 mango is scheduled for fall of
this year and well we could assume that
Windows Phone Apollo or 8 is scheduled
for the fall of next year but then
whatever is going to happen to tango
we're still wondering if that tango
project is really to bring cheap
hardware and a cheaper version of
Windows Phone for a nokia devices and
well everything is good news let's hope
that it does happen and let's hope that
they get some really good people on that
team speaking of software releases
Windows Phone 7 mango rtm build 7720 was
recently leaked and interesting enough
remember rtm means released to
manufacturers it's currently available
in a thread on XDA developers and
according to the threat everything works
like a charm obviously there are some
things that need to be worked on yet and
it's not really simple to update though
it's up to you you can update your
device's if you want then well let's
hope that everything works for the best
rtm is real it's good news because even
though it's hard to update it means that
Microsoft is pretty much just one step
away from releasing now let's hope that
the manufacturers hurry up that the OEM
carriers and everybody else just hurries
up because we want mango on our phones
now and well FF Etta's famous game
developer just posted some images of
different phones that are testing his
games over at Redmond it's interesting
to see that in the
lists we have a nokia 800 in an acer
m310 and though we do know what to make
of the nokia device which is most
probably see ray that converted n9 to
Windows Phone device that we're all
expecting but we really can't make much
out of the Acer device there were other
devices on the list so it's really
interesting and good to see that
Microsoft has a really broad list of
phones that are probably going to be
launched with the mango release let's
hope there are more than less release
because people already know what Windows
Phone 7 is and people really like what
they see well Microsoft has announced 14
new game titles coming to Xbox Live and
you can expect them in the marketplace
in the next coming months now be sure to
hit pocketnow.com for the full list in a
brief description of the all of these 14
games because well the list is quite
long all the games are really quite good
so we take too long and posting them on
the video but it's really interesting to
see that Microsoft is working hard on
breaking more games to the platform and
they're clear that the future lies on
mobile so expect these games really soon
hopefully and most likely will see them
when mango comes to life well does it
follow up to our previous coverage on
the site regarding compound
communications becoming the
manufacturing partner for nokia and
masers windows phones the deal is solid
and it's already planned to ship two
million nokia windows phones in
September talk about a really good way
to know when mango will be released
officially and an interesting note from
Chris Webber which is Nokia's head of
the American sales division is that
they're not planning to sell unlocked
phones in the United States they're
planning to go all over carriers and be
totally aggressive about it they don't
find to be aggressive enough to sell
windows phones nokia windows phones that
are actually cheaper than the cheapest
android handset in the market so that's
really interesting but Chris rubbers
actually mentioning that they're
planning to make this the biggest
comeback in history and hey my money is
down and really saved up to be up there
and in line buying milky windows phones
once their lives so hurry up guys so one
of the things we've noticed ly leaves
the aggressiveness that Microsoft is
using to launch Windows Phone 7 so
aggressive we really didn't see that in
Windows Mobile in all the years that it
existed we've heard the facts that
Microsoft actually paying developer
from the port applications and even more
things but interesting enough we have
microsoft tech sec Brandon Watson who's
been contacting celebrities like Blake
Griffin for example who's in sports
cartoonist Scott Adams and even seen its
mollywood and hook them up with Windows
Phone sevens running the mango built for
them to tell people what they think
about the new devices so far we've been
receiving really good feedback on mango
and what they like about mango and to be
honest with you windows phone 7 in my
case particularly was something that I
really needed to test before i could say
yeah i like it or not and to be honest
with you it's something you just can't
put down once you get it it's so
immersive so mr. Brandon Watson I mean
my dell venue pro is becoming a bit
heavy if you don't mind the samsung
focus would be really nice if you could
hook me up well that that's it for the
good let's continue on with what's bad
microsoft is just announced they'll be
cancelling their Microsoft Reader
program as of now pretty much you can
still use your Microsoft reader books
but the platform will not be working as
of late next year sadly these are very
sad news in particular places like for
example mine Rock purchased almost 40
microsoft reader compliant books that I
can't read anymore I'm actually carrying
an old HP ipaq to 10 from the year of
the dark ages because well first of all
Microsoft reader never made it to
Windows Phone 7 it's only being
supported for windows 7 and windows in
the past then tablets and pretty much um
pcs but that's it it never made it to
Windows Phone 7 it's kind of ironic
considering that the Kindle is now being
such a success that Apple wouldn't sell
ebooks as of two years ago is now making
a lot of money with ebooks and well
Microsoft you've been in the business
almost for 10 years and you're pulling
back from it um really don't understand
then I'm really expecting for you to at
least contact me and tell me hey you
paid so much money for your books and
here's your refund there here's a copy
of an Adobe compliant Booker probably
ereader from friction wise or at least
the kindle book man and we were all
happy with the recent rumors that
microsoft was releasing windows
phone 7 mango as of September first and
everybody was cheering and everything
and then came Joe Belfiore over Twitter
and said sorry guys it's only a rumor
for that launch date and well the
interesting part is that he said it's
only a rumor he didn't say it's not
going to launch on that date he didn't
say that no it's not going to happen he
just said it is a rumor so hopefully we
were right and the platform will be
launching so early but again rtm is
barely out there we haven't received any
feedback from manufacturers or carrier
so not really sure what the make of it
hopefully it will happen at least close
to September first I mean hopefully and
yeah we were all excited about the
fujitsu toshiba au is 12t device making
it to our shores eventually but hey now
we want that thing to stay in Japan and
the reason why is because they've just
priced it and it's going to cost you a
thousand bucks off contract and we're
wondering I mean what are you thinking
about I mean first of all your joint
venture is actually cancelled second of
all the device isn't even in the market
yet there aren't any reviews of people
going crazy making lines after it you're
actually expecting to charge people a
thousand bucks for phone either you guys
are totally wrong with the pricing or
some of us need to move to Japan to be
able to afford that much amount of money
just for phone that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm Hyneman we better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
