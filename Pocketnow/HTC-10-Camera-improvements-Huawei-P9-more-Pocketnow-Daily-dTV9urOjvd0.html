point to a revolutionary camera new
pants tell us what to expect for a
possible gear blink from Samsung and
Huawei joins the dual camera crowd with
a new p 9 i'm high meadow iveta and if I
could have a wish I would definitely ask
for an assistant this is parking out
daily
the official news today begin with
huawei as the company has launched a duo
of p9 devices the p 9 of the p 9 plus
what make these phones special are the
new dual camera modules 12 megapixel
sensors that were built in conjunction
with leica and well they don't work like
the g5 by the way one of these sensors
actually focuses on the regular camera
you know with color and everything the
other is a monochrome sensor that has
the purpose of providing more detail to
the camera obviously we cannot wait to
test that out in our full review very
soon and believe it or not the iPhone se
is apparently sold out in some stores
many analysts were complaining that the
company wasn't selling so well but if
the company has met the amount of the
man that means it has if you want the 64
gig variant that sold out almost
everywhere only the 16 gig model is
available which clearly points to an
apple that was being conservative with
the iPhone s en that finally met its
goal hopefully this means good news for
Apple in the future as you know with the
iPhone slump thinks we're actually
getting out of hand I was moved to
spotlight over to Samsung as we've got a
very interesting patent for the samsung
gear blink listen to this we're talking
about a contact lens with a display that
also has an integrated camera in
addition to a sensor in the middle for
movement because apparently if you blink
you're actually giving that thing
command and you know at this point I
really don't know what's left for
samsung depend this is probably the
craziest one but if the company can't
pull it off I don't even know what I'm
going to do with that thing learn more
in the licks of the description now
we've got some very interesting leaks
from the code within the app store that
shows as an apple that's actually trying
some common sense with its own
applications apparently the company will
now allow you to either disable or
uninstall these applications or at least
hide them because hey the calculator on
iOS is terrible there are so many better
options in the App Store it makes sense
for you not to want to even see it on
your home screen it would also make
sense of Apple would figure out a way
for it just uninstall it and pull it
back from the
appstore but Apple is rather weird about
these things stay tuned we could
probably see that in a future update and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the HTC 10 the company continues
to tease the power of tena now they
focus on the camera telling us how
obsessive they are over the camera and
teasing things like ultrapixel camera 4k
video recording in addition to optical
image stabilization this could be a
really good combo for a company that has
not figured out the camera in years but
that kind of did something interesting
once and just didn't follow up and it
does lead me to the question of the day
what a really great camera experience
make you want to return as an HTC
customer because I'll be fully honest
with you I've been an HTC customer ever
since the compact days if HTC figured
out the camera I would definitely love
to use the HTC tennis my daily driver
