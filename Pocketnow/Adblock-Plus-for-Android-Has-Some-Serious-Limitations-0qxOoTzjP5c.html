pocketnow.com what they like them or not
it seems like we just can't escape them
ads that is there in the games that we
play there in the websites that we surf
they're all over the place is that a bad
thing if you think it is and you want to
block them you've got a new option its
adblock plus it doesn't require route
it's really easy to set up but there are
a few caveats let's go take a look
installing the app is very easy you
install you wait for it and it's done
once you've done that you've got this
nice little nag up here in your
notification shade this essentially says
adblock plus is running no you cannot
get rid of that at least not right now
it's because it always has to run in the
background because you always wanted to
eat blocking ads right so let's go ahead
and take a look at pocket now's website
here's an article that I just wrote and
you'll notice there aren't any ads on it
lots of comments though hey thanks guys
if we switch over to the desktop version
really fast you'll notice that there are
no ads there either now this isn't
necessarily a good thing for publishers
because publishers like pocket now get
paid by you guys looking at ads so keep
that in mind this is kind of an
all-or-nothing thing although you have
some options that you can set up here in
ad lock bucks first of all you can
enable filtering or not on and off very
simple second you can subscribe to a
filter and refresh it this has just got
the easy list which is the default there
are some advanced settings though really
not that much starting at boot
subscribing or updating your
subscription periodically and then of
course refreshing that subscription over
Wi-Fi now that subscription doesn't cost
anything at least not right now all it
does is it gives you an updated list of
things to block very easy very basic now
this extends also across to games so if
you're a big-time gamer if you like say
Angry Birds Star Wars there are
ads in those games too this will block
them but there are some things that you
need to keep in mind you don't need to
be rooted but rooted can help if you're
rooted you will block ads that are
served up whether you're connected to
Wi-Fi or 3G if you're not rooted and are
running Android 3.1 and up it'll block
ads that are served over Wi-Fi but not
over your cellular data connection if
you're not rooted and using Android 3 or
earlier you might have to set some
things up manually there's a link will
provide you over at pocketnow.com that
will tell you how to do that
the last caveat is Android can't block
ads or doesn't let you block ads that
are in SSL encrypted web sites
essentially the data from those sites is
encrypted and the ads therefore are
encrypted as well so you might just see
some some ads that are being pushed over
SSL to get around that but for the time
being for a free app quick and easy to
install that's it that's all you've got
to do if you can live with the caveats
that's great
unfortunately that whole cellular
blocking thing that's where you really
want to block ads the most because
that's chewing up your data from your
metered or limited data plan and if you
could do that without having to get ads
eating into that data that would be even
better whereas Wi-Fi you might not care
as much unfortunately it's just the
opposite but that's just for now so what
did you think if you like seeing what
you saw here and blocking ads at your
leisure make sure you give the video a
big thumbs up if you have any questions
or comments head over to pocketnow.com
where you can leave those over there and
we can all discuss the good the bad and
the ugly and possibly even some other
options for blocking ads for pocket now
showing off adblock plus for Android I'm
