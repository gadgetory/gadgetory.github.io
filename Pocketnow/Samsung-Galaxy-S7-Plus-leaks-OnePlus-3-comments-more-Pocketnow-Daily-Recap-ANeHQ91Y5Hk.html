hate Monday so wait a second not
everybody hates Monday I'm gonna go buy
a gift card for Tommy Hilfiger unless
you get a new shirt fine where's the
gift card kinda did anyone tell you that
you resemble Vin Diesel and no and I've
always found the guy to be ugly that's
right it's that time of the week I am
primarily let up this is PocketNow and
this is the pocket now daily recap for
last week so a good portion of the week
had to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7 and
it's just lovely how most of the
comments don't really have to do with
the s7 and mostly with complaints on
what people want fixed on Monday we
started with the Exynos processor in the
Snapdragon 820 I asked you which one
would you pick and B had to and we
started with 660 comments bring back
expandable storage then I'll come back
to Samsung see what I mean this dragon
doesn't heat up like all right then yes
the Snapdragon for the better you get
this point right Snapdragon 820 because
it'll be on more devices and have less
problems the problems that it does will
have been fixed shortly like in the case
of the 810
you know hey the Exynos was out the sear
on every samsung galaxy flagship and it
didn't have any issues so I don't think
that compatibility is any more a problem
it's really you know which one performs
better and we'll see on Tuesday the
rumors were about the galaxy s7 plus and
we're actually talking about a larger
six inch tablet and I asked you if you
think that there is a market for it we
started with 859 comments Sam said he's
just trying a new thing to see which one
takes off and that is so like Samsung
but I'm happy the company does that but
by the way this wouldn't be the only
company that's done it won't take the
bigger screen just give me a tiny bezels
and keep the same form factor a lot of
companies have done this and it's work
Huawei has done it Oppo has done it the
problem is these companies have done it
with a snapdragon 615 processor would be
great if we had a flagship here again an
s7 the phone of that size offers more
battery China's are off throw my money
towards it and yeah again companies have
done it the biggest challenge is if they
add that Snapdragon you know a 20
processor will it perform well with all
those pixels
to push other phablets at this
form-factor have been proven to be the
best so let's see if Sam Chang's able to
pull it off and Tuesday we receive the
presentations for Sam things about to
happen at CES and we asked you what
would you like the company to announce
we had 975 comments we start with next
year Samsung's launch will be the s7 s7
edge s7 + X 7s pledge God I even got
stuck with that and then the s7 active
and yes that is the way Samsung does
things the company launches a lot of
phone oh we've heard rumors that the
company will actually draw up back
little next year but then we hear the
same thing this year and we're the same
last year so it's kind of hard to
predict if we will be getting all these
products the s7 will be good if it
includes microSD card this time and
change the design otherwise they'll be
an S version like the iPhone success the
reason why I included this comment is
because if you're expecting that this
year rumors are that it won't and we
heard that this week actually I'd like
to see Samsung cell phone carriers that
Samsung will be handling iPhone built
updates from now on no more waiting on
AT&amp;amp;T to get their S together and that
would be an amazing announcement for
this event I mean if it's happened in
other countries why can't Sam Singh
figure it out in the United States if
Apple is able to do that and it's been
able to do that even before the Galaxy
lineup existed then why can't Samson do
the same with all their leverage I mean
they sell more phones than Apple does
Thursday the rumors were about the
oneplus three we heard specifications
even though rather early and I asked you
what would you change from the oneplus 2
in order to make the oneplus 3
interesting next year we'd have 831
comments we start with will NFC in
fingerprint scanner for that Android pay
goodness it's just funny because kind of
people don't really use Android pay up
to the point where Android you know
Google is paying customers a Best Buy
gift card for them to use it so I don't
think that's gonna be a selling point
but hey you're right it would be good
for us to get all the features of an at
typical Android flagship on this phone
if the oneplus 3 can add a better camera
NFC in full quad HD quality on the
display
it may be my next smartphone a lot of
people were not happy with the full HD
display but then again you know we've
been testing
many phones lately you just really can't
tell a difference
seriously get a one plus three but had
NFC a 2k display better camera and front
facing speakers got and I've seen two
gave us play it seems that it's what
consumers want again I just don't think
that it will be possible if you want
this phone to be or to keep the price
range that it has probably the only
thing I'd add would be an AMOLED panel
but hey we'll see and then Friday we
ended with the hottest news of the week
the possibility of split-screen or dual
window on the next version of Android
Android M I asked you if that was
essential to you and we had 698 comments
we start with on tablets absolutely
phones not so much I almost never used
split screen on my LG g4 and I agree
with you it's cool to have split screen
on phones it just can be truly
cumbersome in some cases and then when
you want to navigate and then watch a
video or if you want to navigate for
somebody else while you're doing
something else
it just makes all the sense in the world
so again I would love it to be a
universal Android feature plus we
multitasking would come in very handy on
devices like the moto a Nexus 6 or the
Nexus 6p and the Nexus 9 I could see a
feature for it and yes if you have a
large phablet it makes all the sense in
the world but then again all phones are
getting rather large
yes Microsoft has its amzing has it even
Apple has it without split screen stock
Android feels lacking in capability and
I have to agree with this a lot of
people go crazy over stock Android and
yeah visually it's pleasing to me and
yes it is definitely fluid but I feel
that it lacks functionality compared to
what competitors are doing right now so
I do feel that it is a very necessary
next step for Google to step its game up
over the things that stock Android could
do years ago that was the case you know
Nexus devices would showcase what
Android can do and now it is actually
gonna do less which is you know
pointless in my opinion that's it for
the bargain out daily recap thank you
