the cool things that we like about
android-powered devices the ability to
change the way they look the way they
operate the way they feel just by
installing a replacement launcher app
now it's just as easy as installing any
other app but this one changes the way
it looks and feels on your home screens
and whatnot there are two out there in
the forefront ADW launcher and
launcherpro both are undergoing entire
total rewrites this is the first look
that we've got at what ADW launcher is
doing with their rewrite let's go take a
look okay the first thing that you're
going to notice is the fact that this
doesn't look like anything different and
it's not supposed to ADW launcher is one
of those launchers that's supposed to
look like and function as a replacement
for the stock android launcher and they
do a really good job a couple things
that you'll notice right off the bat and
this is where the bulk of the changes
come into play you know what before I
show you that let me show you the
settings just to let you know this is a
very early what is being called a beta
but it really should be called more a
technology preview so if you look over
here we've got the looping home strains
like we've had in the past where if you
go to the end and that's the end of the
the screens you can flip it again and it
will go to the next one or loop around
to the other side in the app drawer you
can sort either by name or by the times
that you've launched it so kind of the
most frequently used applications are
going to bubble to the top which is nice
but I'd like to be able to change this
in the app drawer itself rather than in
a setting again this might not be the
way that it is in the final release but
it's nice to see that more commonly you
stuff are going to be bubbled together
if you so desire coming down we've got a
swipe up action when you swipe up on
your screen it can do any one of these
things if you swipe down it can do any
one of these things which it's the same
list but you can now have two different
functions just by swiping up or swiping
down on the home screen and that's it
there
no more settings now if you're familiar
with ADW launcher you know that there
are tons and tons and tons of settings
this one there are not including screen
animation settings and whatnot or
transitions between the home screens the
reason for that is this is still very
very early in development but it's more
a proof of concept to show you what has
been done so that's the settings you
can't do a lot here's that screen
transition that I was telling me about
just a simple swipe from side to side
and then of the rotation or the scale
and pop and what not like we've had in
the past also I can't come in and
customize my doc I long press and I can
get my thumbnails but I can't customize
my dock icons or navigate through like I
have in the past now a side note here
you'll notice that i have my my taskbar
if you will my system tray down here at
the bottom that's a feature of
cyanogenmod 7 not related to to the
launcher app but let's get back to the
launcher so what does this launcher have
well if we come in there's your app
drawer I can't change the speed at which
it fades in and out which kind of makes
it feel a little bit slow even though
it's not so I'd like to somehow have a
way to customize the speed to try and
speed that up a bit there is not a any
kind of pagination in the drawer which I
wish there were but again you'll have
that most frequently used stuff up at
the top if you show decide to to
configure it that way but what do you
have okay here I've got gmail right if I
long press on gmail now you'll see I
have this new context sensitive little
bubble that pops up that lets me either
remove this from the home screen edit it
so if I don't want to call it gmail if I
want to call it something else or even
assign a different icon I can do that
through the edit feature just like that
if I want to get the application info
this is really handy and this alone
makes it worthwhile if I want to find
out all I want to about this I want to
move it to the SD card which you don't
want to do with gmail by the way or stop
uninstall it see what the cash is what
the the defaults are for it I can go
ahead and do that
right here I don't have to go into
settings like settings and down to
wherever it went applications manage
applications scroll down here try and
find gmail where is gmail right there
open it up I don't have to do that
anymore instead all I have to do is long
press and info right there like that
similarly if I want to find out more
about it in the market I can simply tap
and it will take me right to that apps
instance in the market so I can see if
there are any updates you can see who
it's by I can even go in and look at
other look come on allow automatic
updating I want to see what's related I
want to see other apps written by the
same developer all right there because
I've had that long press context now on
the homepage and of course we have share
if I want to be able to share this with
anyone of my shareable apps and this is
going to be different depending on your
device for example I have facebook and
this IP webcam app installed so I have
those showing up my twitter app is plume
so it's going to let me share by ploom
whatnot I don't know how it's going to
share it but okay it's just sharing the
market link in this case but still very
cool I've been using this as my daily
driver for the last couple days and it's
it's nice it does what it's supposed to
and nothing else it is still an early
beta but it shows us a little hint at
what the revamped version of ADW
launcher is going to be like hopefully
in the near future there is no ETA or
release date yet this is just kind of
the developer getting out there into the
community so you guys can test it play
with it see what you like suit you don't
like report any errors that you come
across to help the development process
along still very cool it's a step in the
right direction and I like it a lot
we'll try and keep you posted with any
updates that they have to the beta but
we'll definitely let you know about the
actual release of the the new version of
the app because that's what we do if you
want to try out this he's calling it a
beta so we will too if you want to try
out adw.launcher beta
you can go ahead and do that head over
to pocketnow.com and i will give you a
link to the APK sorry Lu AT&amp;amp;T folk you
have to be able to sideload apps to be
able to run this that's one of the
reasons why we give you these in-depth
videos but still very cool very neat
showing off new beta launchers for
pocket now I'm Jolie by
