to parents affected by in-app purchases
Google's mobile chrome browser now
compresses data for faster surfing and
get ready for the black phone both you
and the NSA I'm hi meri behna and after
a ton of coffee and a lot of issues
let's just say that I'm starting to
become awake this is foggy now daily
let's start today off with some official
news as Apple yes has to return 30 2.5
million dollars to a lot of parents that
were affected by in app purchases and if
you remember back in the day it was
really easy for anybody to just buy
anything from the app store without the
users consent or the person owning the
credit card so all these parents are now
we getting a refund for their money but
also apple now has to figure out how to
get the consent of parents whatever they
give their children phones or tablets
that it could obviously have in-app
purchases again so let's see how Apple
figures that one out another cool news
Google's mobile chrome browser is
getting actually more efficient the
company has now announced that they are
actually going to be using service to
compress data in order for you to save
data and at the same time get faster
browsing and if this doesn't ring a bell
that's the way opera Mobile's mobile
browser used to work which is great that
we get this on google chrome i just
don't know if this is gonna work on iOS
i do know that this is going to work on
android so stay tuned obviously whatever
you do on incognito mode or whatever you
do on private websites is not going to
require this service and obviously load
a little slower so it would stay tuned
for that now start about HP and no i
didn't get the company name wrong we
haven't heard about HP in mole and a
long time aside from some slight tablets
but now we're getting a voice to have
six in a voice tab 7 and these are
pretty much between phablets and tablets
but they do have voice capabilities so
this pretty much marks the company's
come back into mobile phones let's just
see how good these products are we don't
get any dates any markets any specific
stay tuned for mwc we'll probably get
some stuff there now sorry about
motorola i know a lot of you have fallen
in love with the Moto X and as Dennis
Woodside the company CEO has just
confirmed the company's not stopping
there they're also working on
and moto maker will work for this tablet
so you get a customer I stab the
question is what exactly does Motorola
plan to bring to this talent to make it
unique and great in the hand and
functional just like we found the Moto X
and hopefully they also bring the better
camera even though on tablets that's
really not the deal and finally for the
hot news of the day let's talk about the
black phone and yes there is this new
phone out there that's focused on
security though all we get is really an
image of the phone and we don't really
see a product and the whole point is
that this is a joint venture between
geek phone and also silent circle and
the idea is to bring you stock Android
with an extra layer of encryption that's
specially designed by this company and
apparently this will be better than
whatever the NSA can hack or so they say
obviously we don't get any confirmation
it's just interesting that they're
bringing us a phone and not actually
selling us the later for us to use on
our current phones but anyways that
leads us to the question of the day how
important is security for you on your
phone because in my particular case I
don't know if I would actually pay for
phone just because of its added security
but I do know that since I handle so
much sensitive data on my phone I do
prefer to have that extra layer of
security and I don't understand why
they're not just selling the layer but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
