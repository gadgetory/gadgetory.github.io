looking forward to record-breaking
iPhone sales even better than the iPhone
6 president Trump is back on Twitter
accusing Google of being rigged when you
type Trump news and LG is celebrating
the 40th anniversary in the United
States by doing 40 Days of Giveaways I'm
Jaime Rivera and I know you're not used
to seeing me like this but this is the
ephah attire there's a lot of coverage
coming very soon this is rocking out
daily powered by qualcomm the official
news today begin with giveaways and this
comes from LG the company is celebrating
40 years of being in the US market by
offering 40 Days of Giveaways and the
first giveaway is actually an OLED TV
which LG is really famous for phones and
other accessories are coming very soon
you can learn more about everything in
the description now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy watch because of the
company has addressed something that I
was about to complain about but well I
need to get the update and tell you more
about it they have brought some
improvements into their health services
in order for a fitness tracking to be
better my experiences so far have been
that it loses the heart rate sensor very
often while you're training you're not
getting the most accurate data so I will
be reporting back and letting you know
if they actually figured it out in
addition to I hope they bring more
modules how can you post it now how
about if we talk about President of the
United States Donald Trump as he was
recently on Twitter complaining that
Google is rigged against him that
whenever you type Trump news you get
fake news mostly from CNN quote unquote
by mr. Trump and saying that Google is
rigged Google just responded that they
have no political agenda that if you
type Trump information obviously you are
going to get all the information you can
get let us know what you think in the
comments about this whole ordeal because
I find it hilarious now let's talk about
VEVO we've got some interesting leaks of
the VEVO 11pro that we're assuming looks
like the Oppo r17 that pretty much just
got announced that might also look like
the oneplus 60 that is being rumored to
be coming very soon when it comes to
this a premium mid-range
pacification you can read more about
them in the description so far let's see
what we get it's apparently coming very
soon
and finally the hottest news that they
have to do with iPhones because
apparently Cupertino is gearing up to
sell more iPhones than ever for those of
you that don't remember the records were
in 2014 with the iPhone 6 apparently the
company is going to some crazy links
when it comes to manufacturing in order
to be able to create as many as they can
the forecast is higher than the iPhone 6
and that's rather interesting as we
thought that the iPhone 10 wasn't
selling so well and then it turned out
that it has
so in today's question let us know what
do you think do you think that the
strategy of three iPhones with a price
tag between 700 and probably more than a
thousand is going to be enough for Apple
to sell more because in my case probably
that entry-level iPhone will make a dent
that's my opinion
leave us a comment down below we love
yours this episode of the pocket out
daily is sponsored by Qualcomm ever
notice that your cell phone signal is
the weakest when you need it most when
you want to download or upload something
maybe you're in an office building at
the mall or in a crowd of thousands at
that event well with an Android phone
using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 you'd
get faster data speeds even in the
weakest signal areas then phones with
Intel based modems on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
head on over to the link in the
description below to learn more about
real-world data from Oakley yourself
