pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the samsung epix on the AT&amp;amp;T
network it's a windows mobile 6.1
professional device that just came out
and I know a lot of people have been
waiting for this to come out so let's
take a look at the hardware starting off
we have a 2.5 inch touchscreen and the
resolution is 320 x 320 it's not a
rectangular aspect screen as you can see
it's square which is kind of
unconventional moving below the AT&amp;amp;T
logo we have a left softkey and a right
softkey followed by a call start and
call end key and the cost start key will
double as a speaker phone if you press
and hold it while you're in a call and
then we have a button to launch the
start menu and an ok button in the
center we have this optical joystick
which actually controls a virtual mouse
pointer and it's actually pretty cool
and something that I really like about
this device is that your thumb never
really leaves the center area because
there are soft keys so you're moving the
cursor with this and you're you're
pressing on the soft keys like that and
it's great for one handed usability if
you look at the palm treo pro which
doesn't have these soft keys if you're
if you're operating the d-pad and moving
around menus to confirm a selection you
have to press on the screen like that
and move your thumb a lot so I think the
epics is going to rank really high in
one-handed usability so going down to
the keyboard we see that it's a full
qwerty keyboard with pretty large-sized
keys and nice spaces to access the
numbers which are embedded in the
letters you have to hold down the
function key or if you're dialing from
the home screen we'll talk about this
later you just start dialing and it will
know that you're dialing numbers on the
bottom of the keyboard we have some
programmable buttons so camera mail all
of these can be used to launch various
programs and also you can you can
program any key on the keyboard to
launch a program by holding down the
function button so you've got a ton of
programmable shortcut buttons that you
can use if you're if you're trying to
launch programs quickly we'll talk about
that later off to the left side we have
a kind of chrome strip here and a power
button to the right of that we have a
very predominant volume rocker which is
good because when you're on a call you
can feel for it easily turning over to
the back we have a two mega
so camera self-portrait mirror and
stereo speakers we also have a really
easy to open battery latch which is
refreshing because some other devices
take a lot of time to get to the battery
over to the other side we have a microSD
slot covered with a flap hopefully that
will be durable and to the right of that
we have the charging syncing and audio
port that uses Samsung's proprietary
connector on the bottom we have nothing
but the microphone and on the top we
have the stylus which is in an awkward
place up here at the top I don't like
this too much and it's it's collapsible
three ways look at this two three it's
kind of kind of unique but I think
Samsung is trying to discourage you from
using the stylist by having the optical
mouse cursor and you know what I really
haven't pulled out the stylus too many
times because I'm finding that the mouse
to be a really good addition so next up
we're going to talk about software on
the samsung epix and don't forget to
