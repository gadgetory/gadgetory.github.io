headphone jack on the upcoming iPads but
there's a reason for that we get some
rumors that show was an impressive
screen size for the Galaxy S 10 and note
10 apparently its gaming phone season
some leaks of the Xiaomi Black Shark two
have just emerged I'm high metal Iveta
reporting from London because you know
while we make 20 I made 20 pro this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with product announcements that I
have been waiting for one of my biggest
complaints of having mobile devices edit
video is that they're not really that
capable and then I find that Adobe
Premiere Pro is just too complicated so
the company is building something in
between
it's called Adobe Rush it's part of the
premier crowd Creative Cloud actually
you know Adobe CC and while the price
tag starts at $9.99 depending on
whatever type of tier system you have
and it works across platforms and it has
a lot to do with Adobe After Effects
when it comes to what powers it you
learn more about everything in the
description I'll definitely give it a
try for those of you that don't really
care about that
HTC Exodus I'm still going to talk about
it because well that whole blockchain
phone that was a rumored and leaked as
apparently a reality there seems to be
an event on October 22nd what exactly is
going to make this phone special and why
is it being called Exodus is funny but
yeah let's expect something new from HTC
hopefully it's gonna be good
now let's talk about Xiaomi as it seems
that gaming phones are the thing right
now
apparently there's a certification in
Tina for a black shark too and this is
their latest edition of the gaming phone
it's got new Cronus and different colors
it's sort of like what the razor phone 2
is doing only with more lights four
thousand milliamp hour battery and
obviously it's got to have other things
that make it a gaming phone we will stay
tuned and see what exactly it is now
let's hope the spotlight over to Samsung
as well we know that the Galaxy S 10
might be launching early next year we
hear that there are changes in the
display size apparently it's gonna be a
little larger than the Galaxy Note 9 at
6.44 inches but hold on I mean it seems
that there will be a note 10
coming out either at the same clan or
close to it or probably later and next
screen is gonna be even larger six point
six six inches and I'm like why are
these numbers being provided but
whatever the case hopefully these
devices are as hot as the rumors have
been claiming and finally the hottest
news today I have to do with iPads and I
know iPads aren't necessarily hot but
there are some interesting changes in
the iPad probes that are coming we've
seen the leaks of bezel edge to edge
displays and that they're getting
smaller but apparently they're also
losing the headphone jack and the reason
why is not because of any other excuse
that Apple wants to make them so thin
that the headphone jack is barely not
gonna fit the chassis at five point nine
millimeters I believe it is I'm not
exactly sure need to look more into this
but yeah it seems that there is a
purpose for the depth of the headphone
jack I just wish that they would bundle
like air pods in the box and be like you
know give us 50 bucks more and get the
air pots but let us know in the comments
what do you think do you think this is a
good or a bad idea because in my case I
always think that Lucent losing features
is not a great idea I would rather more
battery life on iPads than a thinner
device but leave us a comment down below
we love to know your opinion friends
