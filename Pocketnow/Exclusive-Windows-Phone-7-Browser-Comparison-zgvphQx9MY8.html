pocket now calm and this is an exclusive
look at the web browsing experience on
windows phone 7 we're going to compare
to the iphone 4 and to the google nexus
one running froyo should be a lot of fun
let's get to it Oh
now before getting started it's very
important to mention that what you're
about to see is not final hardware or
software it's not a representation of a
device you're going to be able to get so
keep that in mind it's an LG Panther
development device which you've seen
many many times at a lot of different
tech blogs around the internet so just
keep that in mind we're doing this just
for fun and the performance results you
see here are not an accurate
representation of what you'll be able to
expect when you get a windows phone 7
device coming up this fall I should
mention that this is running build 64 14
of Windows Phone 7 the same build that
we shown you on the emulator the same
bill that you can get right now in an
emulator to run on your computer so the
software is going to look very familiar
that's why we wanted to do a comparison
between multiple devices something you
really can't do at home so let's get to
it we're first going to talk about
Internet Explorer mobile in a more
general fashion here before doing the
comparison so this is going to look very
familiar with ferd for those of you that
have used the emulator so we have these
buttons along the bottom we can manage
multiple tabs one of the unique parts of
Windows Phone 7 is that you can actually
load tabs while looking at other tabs so
I'm going to load a bunch of tabs you're
going to get a sense for how fast the
browser is here so I'm going to load
pocket now calm and I'm going to jump
back into the tabbed interface here and
I'm going to load another website let's
launch amazon let's go back we're just
going to keep going fill up the six tabs
you can have a total of six tabs let's
load the new york times and y times by
the way this on-screen keyboard is quite
good but this video is not about the
on-screen keyboard let's keep going
let's load say you know gizmodo and
finally let's finish up just on Google
okay so as promised while we were
loading all of these tabs the other ones
we're loading in the background so
pocket now calm here it is we can jump
out amazoncom has finished loading and
let's move around on the page to get a
general sense for performance so we can
flick scroll obviously we can pinch to
zoom which is buttery smooth a mega huge
improvement over the stock Internet
Explorer that came on Windows Mobile
legacy we can move around on the screen
of course there is screen rotation it's
a little bit slow in this build but
again this is not final software so it's
very likely that that will be faster
when you actually get a device you can
jump to other tabs very quickly has very
good tab management we can also close
them quite easily by just tapping on the
X so we can go to a particular website
mess around with the page there is no
flash or html5 support right now
microsoft says there may or may not have
that in the future we don't know the
answer to that but it does compromise a
few web pages because not all of the
elements get loaded so what we can do
here from the bottom was we can add this
as a favorite very simple clean Metro
interface allows you to do that we can
jump down into here to the other
settings and not many things you can
change you can delete history allow
cookies to load and so on and so forth
again not many settings you can change
at this point but that may change you
can share page you can find something on
a page or you can pin to the start page
like you can do with an iphone or even
android so you can actually have the
pocket now calm tile on your start page
if you go to that website a lot or the
gizmodo tile or the engadget I'll
whatever website you visit on a regular
basis you can help to customize your
Start screen with internet favorites
which is always a nice feature so what
I'm gonna do now is close all of these
tabs which you can do very quickly
although it would be nice if there was a
close all button but they close fast
enough and we are going to bring out the
other two devices and compare the
internet browsing experience with iPhone
and Android let's do it okay here we
aren't we have Windows Phone 7 in the
center about android 2.2 on the nexus
one on the right and iOS 4.1 on the
on the iphone 4 here so we're going to
go to the same website and try to time
it so that they all go at the same time
see which browser is faster although
again keep in mind this is not final
software we're doing this just for fun
so let's try to do this at the same time
it's always a little tricky okay and
they're all perfect the same time looks
like the nexus one is ahead
okay windows phone 7 actually finished
first they're very impressive followed
by the iphone 4 followed by the nexus
one by the way i've turned off plugins
so it's not trying to avoid a flash
content and taking a while on the nexus
one here so windows phone 7 one there
and let's take a look at how they feel
scrolling down the page so the iphone
okay it skipped a little bit
checkerboard windows phone 7 no
checkerboard no checkerboard on android
either you can see that the actual
kinetic scrolling is probably the
smoothest on the iphone followed by
Windows Phone 7 which is also quite
smooth and finally android 2.2 once in a
while can get a little bit choppy if
it's loading and intense website so
let's zoom in a little bit see if we can
compare how smooth the zoom is on all
these devices all are pretty smooth
androids a little bit choppy in this
case let's try to tap on this link at
the same exact time and we'll do another
take it which device is fastest so you
can do this okay and they're off
okay iphone finish first here followed
by Android followed by windows phone 7
last by about point five seconds still
quite impressive move down on the page
we're getting some checker boards over
here on the iphone 4 let's stop the
nexus one here from loading let's go to
a different website this time let's hit
up engadget com and see which device
gets there the fastest okay let's try to
do this at the same time okay and
they're off the same exact time let's
see which gets to engadget first
hopefully they'll all go to the desktop
view and not the mobile site which it
looks like they are
okay iphone 4 finish first followed by
the nexus one looks like Windows Phone 7
is going to come and last again in this
case so so far windows phone 7 came in
first one time came in last two times
but is still very very much faster than
the pocket Internet Explorer that we
remember from windows mobile so huge
advancements in that respect get some
checkerboard over there nexus one really
doesn't provide any checkerboard and if
we click really fast on windows phone
seven here we don't get checkerboard we
actually just get some blank spots and I
can't even get that to happen so pretty
impressive on that front let's check
screen rotation speeds across all these
three devices go to the top go go iphone
to Windows Phone 7 first okay windows 17
beat the iphone their iPhone one there
let's do one more time exactly the same
time okay iphone one there it's trying
to load a page so kind of inconclusive
there let's take a look at the nexus one
next to Windows Phone 7 okay nexus one
was faster and screen rotation I think
that's helped because android 2.2
doesn't really have a fancy animation
when when going over into landscape or
portrait just happens so screen rotation
is faster in android 2.2 compared to
windows phone 7 and let's go to one more
website before we wrap up this video
let's just jump in to amazon.com to see
how that looks there we go
and they're off okay so we got the
mobile site on two of these and on the
Windows Phone 7 device we did not so
let's go to the full site so we can be
on the same exact page take a look at
how the double tap to zoom feature
behaves differently on these devices so
double tap double tap double tap so a
little bit choppy on the the nexus one
there it's not responding too well on
the iPhone very strange so we'll tap on
this kindle story here
okay looks like the nexus one finished
first followed by the iphone 4 and then
witness when someone's going to come
last year so what we learned from doing
this experiment is that Windows Phone 7
browsers on track to be among the
fastest web browsers that are available
on smartphone operating systems now of
course again this is not final hardware
or software so it's impossible to make a
final determination about the browser
performance but we can say that
Microsoft is absolutely on the right
track to make a browser that is
comparable to the best mobile browsers
out there which is extremely important
for the success of any smartphone
operating system so pretty good marks
here for windows phone 7 at least the
beta here and now please subscribe to
our channel for more videos on
smartphones and other operating systems
and be sure to give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoyed it thanks for watching
