Samsung improve its TouchWiz user
interface fossil lays down details on
its plan for smart wearables coming soon
and if you're struggling with microSD
issues on the oneplus X a solution might
just have arrived I'm high Meadow iveta
and you guys are lucky we don't really
celebrate Thanksgiving here so yeah
here's the news i don't get the day off
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with one plus as the
company has just confirmed that it's
working on a firm war for the oneplus x
it's actually already testing it it
should be out in the next few days
apparently you have improvements to the
regular stability and bug fixes but the
most important one is actually micro SD
card improvements to support other cards
in addition to also allow you to not
have to reset your phone every time you
swap the card but you're really
interesting updates that we hope will
bring a better experience other official
news have to do with cyanogenmod 13 it
was official a few days ago and and
brought support for hot devices like the
LG g4 the google nexus 7 in addition to
others but today the company has just
announced support for other phones like
the LG g2 believe it or not the LG g2
the Google Nexus 5x the Nexus 6p in
addition to others there's a full list
of the ledge of the description yes
you're getting marshmallow here though
in a buggy fashion for starters and even
though we weren't expecting any more
galaxy devices to be announced for the
rest of the year we've got certification
documents that show us the Galaxy a nine
would probably be launched on December
first which is okay but hey we also got
news of the galaxy a7 we've got
certification documents from Tina that
show us that the phone will be ready in
twenty sixteen and it looks a whole lot
like the galaxy s6 which is a good
diluting thing anyways awesome of the
spotlight over to fossil and it's Q line
of wearables we know that the company
announced as many as three wearables out
of which one of them is actually going
to be running Android wear which is the
Q founder those of you that were
wondering what price tags were coming
from fossil given that this is the
fashion brands you're actually going to
be shocked as apparently the Q founder
is only going to retail for 275 bucks
and it'll bring some major improvements
when compared to the Moto 360 and even
the huawei watch because this is going
to be one of the few Android wear
wearables to include gps functionality
addition to other things that we expect
with its design this is really
interesting the only other SmartWatch
that remember is the Sony SmartWatch 3
and yeah gps functionality is extremely
important if you want more pricey and
details for the other wearables they're
available in the lecture description as
well and finally the hot rumors up today
have to do with samsung and google as
apparently both companies are working
together in improving TouchWiz and we do
know that Samsung made some major
improvements with the galaxy s6 and
going forward but apparently google is
going to help Sam st. optimize the user
interface even more we're not really
sure if that means design changes are
just improvements and stability and
other things but it's great to see that
Google and Samsung are working together
again something that hadn't really
happened for a while and this is
androids largest OEM but it does lead me
to the question of the day which is your
favorite android skin if any which one
do you prefer to use in my case
obviously stock Android is my favorite
but I'm not gonna lie my second favorite
is actually OPOs color or west the
latest variant then it has a lot to do
with the fact that it looks a lot like
iOS I know but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you use
most friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the most
earlier before this video was so make
sure you follow us on pocketnow.com and
subscribe to a tube channel as well it
follow me on twitter hi not record any
better on instagram it hi medley betta
