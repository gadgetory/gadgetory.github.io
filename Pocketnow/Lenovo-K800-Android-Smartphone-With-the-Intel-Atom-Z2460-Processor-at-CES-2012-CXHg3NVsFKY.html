pocketnow.com and we're here demoing the
lenovo Cade hundred smartphone which is
the first intel atom processor 72-hour
sorry Z 2460 device being sold and we
have Wang here who's going to give us a
small little demo of the device so tell
me about the lenovo device that i wasn't
able to see it the past dinner actually
this this device has a coupon 5-inch
spring okay 4.5 inches yes yep and the
Russian is 720p yes is 1280 x 7 30 okay
720p resolution on the display 4.5
inches yeah so he's a-hidin the d string
okay and wake up
I enjoyed on it it's a android 2.3 right
yeah gingerbread okay it was the name of
a custom and you last night okay widget
okay navigation all these regions okay
can you show me the phone the design
this is the final design this is not a
prototype right nice quite close to
final okay it's it's it's a plastic bag
it's kind of a it's it's not rugged and
it's not smooth it's it's got this
little texture on it very smooth then we
have what kind of camera here it's not a
news camera roughly 8 megapixel camera
and it shoots 1080p too sure ok we have
a dual flash right here and then we have
on the side we have a volume buttons we
have a micro USB at the bottom nothing
on this side and then at the top is this
a speaker's right yeah yeah okay and the
headset jack and the power button now
show me the performance show me how fast
this device is can you show me like
browsing performance hey what takes
advantage of this Intel Atom processor
it was
oh it's okay you can just show me how
fast the phone moves around try to move
it as fast as you can let's swipe it
there let's try to launch an application
for example let's launch there's a lot
okay a video straight let's see TV okay
it takes a little bit to load give me
one I use them let me see okay
connecting ok let's try to play it ok
you know the 720p resolution on this
display is beautiful looks very very
good but you look at that and the image
is moving very fast all this yeah
there's very little operative ok now
let's try to launch the browser see how
the browser behaves we got the browser
right here let's try to load something
let you play it lets you pick real gasps
oh let's see if I can load on the icon
pocket now
you need it calm down here
Ilana seasonal work yeah sadly we're not
able to test it but well everything else
looks fine show me you know these
hardware buttons well they're capacitive
buttons but show me how they work
because they're very different you're
selling this phone in the United States
right miss Marie turnovers okay starting
in China next quarter and then you bring
it to the United States so show me how
the user interface works because it's
totally unique this is on a little
calmer you are into the yeah message it
says message it and the mail right okay
so how do you use this button you swipe
to go home they say the Hope Street okay
no matter wherever you are press the
hold okay so so in this phone it's a
home button because I noticed that the
chinese models that you had at the other
food that doesn't behave differently you
had to swipe them because i still have
the pinch out yes it has the pinch out
similar people you can choose your
window this is probably yes menu is the
menu key okay you see my fans okay now
is there a possibility of getting ice
cream sandwich on this phone in the
future yeah one day John Salmons
eventually ok ok this is carrying what
sort of network right now well geez you
do this again magician his mom okay cdma
hspa+ obviously
wcdma okay I got you that's gsm okay so
well thank you very much weighing for
the preview obviously this is not a
final ace unit there are still little
choppiness but I imagine them this would
be polished eventually so far the lomo
device brings a sort of an iconic design
it's different it's not squared edges
it's just totally different I think it's
a very good contender smartphone for the
future this is hi Mary Vettel reporting

smartphones that will be released with
the Intel chip thank you very much
