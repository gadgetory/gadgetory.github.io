pocket now calm and this is one of
several software tours for the HTC hd2
this device has the largest touchscreen
of any smartphone on the market it also
is a capacitive multi-touch display
which is the first for windows mobile so
in this video we're going to cover HTC
Sense which is really HTC's interface
for this device previously known as
touchflo 3d or manila as some people
know it we've shown this to you a few
times on the touch pro 2 but now with
the Snapdragon processor and the final
release of the hd2 we've really get to
see it in its full glory so let's start
let's turn on the device and this is
just the standard windows mobile 6.5
lock screen although they actually
change the icons a little bit we're
going to slide this over and zoom in on
the screen and get started with the tour
of HTC Sense so starting off we have the
nice weather clock which is on some
newer HTC devices if we tap on the clock
we're taken to the world clock we can
add multiple locations or we can set the
alarm clock pretty basic stuff if we tap
on the picture of the the rain cloud
will be taken right to the weather tab
now this device automatically knows
where you are so if you're traveling it
will automatically adjust the location
the time the weather to exactly where
you are and you can also have many
different backgrounds on the screen so
we can have the weather background and
to give you a demo of what that looks
like I can go down here to weather demo
and you'll see this appear behind the
time and all of the things on your main
screen so you can flick through when
it's raining nice big windshield wiper
will come down if it's snowing you'll
have frost on the screen we've shown
this to you before you've probably seen
it many times and we'll just finish up
here if it's windy leaves are flying by
so it really kind of immerses you in
your environment which is really unique
for a smartphone if it's snowing you get
the snowflakes and finally if it's
thundering outside you will get some
flashes of lightning on your screen
pretty cool stuff you can also change
the wallpaper to be animated here's the
setting for whether wallpaper or we can
just choose a static picture so we can
choose say this one which we've probably
seen before and you'll see in a minute
things start to fly around on the
if that's a little too distracting for
you you can get a static wallpaper
although oddly it's not listed as static
wallpaper you have to go to animated
wallpaper and then you have to go to
albums and all and then we see all of
the kind of static wallpaper let's
choose the simple brown one and it will
sort of fade in and look really nice
going down the home screen we have the
calendar so if we click on here we will
be taken to our calendar actually the
calendar tab on HTC Sense and we're
going to cover that more detail
momentarily down here are some quick
links and these are really great because
these can be either links to websites or
links to programs or links to contacts
so here I have a contact that I like to
call a regular basis ifd browser and
I've pocketnow.com and it actually gives
you a little thumbnail of the website
kind of like you get on the iPhone
launching programs is super fast you've
probably seen that already just moving
around on the screen everything is
extremely responsive and as you see more
software videos from us you're really
going to get a sense for that so let's
say we want to add a new bookmark this
comes right from opera mobile so I'm
going to add TechnoBuffalo and you can
see a little screenshot of the site
there let's add a program so you can
really customize this to all the
programs you use the most so you're not
really digging through the start menu
trying to find programs that you use on
a regular basis let's see if there's
anything else in here that we want to
take a look at we can remove the Quick
Links if you don't want to have the
calculator anymore quite simply and we
can also change the weather settings and
adjust the homescreen tabs we want to
disable some of these tabs or move them
around like so although this was present
in previous versions of touchflo 3d
somebody hit cancel and let's go on to
the next step this is really cool this
is the people tab and this is kind of a
revamped version of what you had before
in touch flo 3d so instead of having
kind of like a cover flow like contact
tab now it's just a grid which is much
easier to use and what's really cool is
that if you get an email from anyone
here or text message or an mms you'll
get a little indicator so right now i
can see that i have a new email from
alana tapping on that i can go right to
her integrated Contacts tab which lets
me see her texan
her emails her facebook status updates
and her calls and I'm taken right to the
email tab a really convenient way to
sort of be able to tell who is
communicating with you out of the people
that you communicate with on a regular
basis this can be great for business
users or for people that really like to
keep in touch and if we go into menu
let's see what we can do here we can add
a favorite or just remove a favorite or
we can go to the all people tab and
we'll talk more about that in future
videos the next tab we have just the
standard text messaging screen and we
can flick up and down we've seen this
before and it takes you right into the
message so I'm going to go back going
over to the email screen now we get a
bigger view of the emails that we have
in the inbox so as whereas before in
touch flo 3d you only got to see a few
lines now you get to see pretty much the
entire top part of the message and
tapping on the email obviously bring it
into its full screen glory and you can
switch between multiple accounts over
here or make a new account or write a
new message I should say by pressing on
this button let's go over to the
internet tab which is kind of made to
look like the Contacts tab so now
they're all arranged in grids and if you
have any favorites that you want to add
it will save it as a little thumbnail
which is a very nice visual
representation you can quickly launch
the browser by tapping on this icon or
you can get to a google search by just
typing in a query up here and pressing
on the the search button we're going to
talk more about the Internet experience
especially compared to other devices
like the touch pro two on the iphone in
future videos over here in the calendar
tab is the completely revamped calendar
application so if we go to month we're
taken to this beautiful month display we
can go to next month or the previous
month tapping on a day will bring up the
agenda for that day and we can kind of
tap through to the different views that
they have this one's especially useful
the agenda view so you can see sort of
quickly in a linear fashion what you
what you need to be doing if we go to
menu we have some extra views we can go
to the year view and HTC has integrated
this very well with Windows Mobile so if
we go to menu and new appointment we're
taken into a beautiful looking way to
add a new appointment it's not the
standard windows mobile
the interface it's very much spruced up
with this gray and the HTC style buttons
so a very deep integration of the
calendar i'm going to hit cancel there
and go to the next step stocks tab
really hasn't been changed much since
previous versions of clutch flow 3d so
we're not going to cover that and now we
get into the really really cool stuff so
ignore that picture of my feet so here
we are in photos and video we've seen
this before but if we rotate the device
into landscape watch what happens this
is beautiful we get into this beautiful
landscape 3d photo gallery and we're
going to start talking about multi-touch
in a minute but let's get to a picture
let's tap on this picture it comes up it
fades up beautifully we can pinch to
zoom wow it's very surprising to to
actually be doing that the windows
mobile device the pinch to zoom works
fantastically well it redraws the
picture very quickly we can swipe to go
to the next picture this is probably the
best viewing experience for photos I've
ever seen the screen looks fantastic
it's very easy to be super precise
precise with the pinching and the
dragging and tapping to double double
tapping the zoom also works we go to the
right and see all of the beautiful
pictures that are in here and there are
some options on all of the pictures so
if we tap here and we go to this one we
can save it as a screen image save as a
contact delete it set as a footprint
which we're going to talk about in a
minute or here's a quick way to email it
send it as a message or put it up on
facebook speaking of facebook let's get
back to the the portrait display let's
take a look at the new photo album view
so if we go down to albums and albums
down here we even new tab here F for
facebook if you're logged into Facebook
watch what you can do this is just
awesome so here I have all of my
Facebook friends and I can view their
photos as if they existed on my device
so let's just take anyone here i'm going
to take myself and here are all my photo
albums and i'm going to click on cruise
to the bahamas and it's going to load
all of my photos from facebook so I or
from this particular folder so I'm going
to be able to tap on any of them and
bring it up just as if i was browsing it
on my device and i can pinch to zoom
just like i had these stored on the
device it's really
an amazing experience and it's really
just a fantastic way to view photos so
let's get out of that tap on the screen
great let's go to the next tab the music
tab which has also been redesigned so
just like the Photos tab if I tilt the
device this way I'll get this gorgeous
animation wow this is in my opinion much
nicer than what you get on the iPhone or
iPod touch so we can browse through our
music with this beautiful cover flow the
3d reflection below if we want to play
some music let's say we want to play
this way sir we tap on there Beverly
Hills will start playing when I press
the play button I can go to the next
song I can find it and browse through
more music it's really a really a
fantastic way to listen to music and
really experience it in a huge screen
with very fluid graphics let's get back
into portrait and there's some other
things you can do up here there's a
button here that will actually query for
album art so that if you have some
albums that don't have art associated
with them yet it will reach out to the
internet and get them there's some other
buttons here up here there are some
other buttons up here as well like
repeat and if we go into library we are
taken into the HTC music library that
we've seen on other devices so you get
full album art or you can go to songs or
genres or just flick along the bottom in
this touchflo 3d like display that we
have seen before but it's just
especially fluid on the hd2 I have no
idea so this is it came on the device I
promise okay let's go over now to the
weather tab but weather tab is mostly
unchanged from previous versions except
now there are easier ways to remove
locations so look I have to first add a
location before I can remove one so
let's type here Paris and by the way
we're going to talk about the on-screen
keyboard in future videos here's Paris
comes up very fast
and now let's say we want to remove
Paris well before we had to do it one by
one but now if we go to menu and we go
remove location we can uncheck so
pretend you have you know 10 locations
that you've added or in my case when I
turn on the device for the first time
there were six or seven cities that I'd
never visit so I just went down the list
check check check I hit done and then I
was only left with my home area right
here okay so let's move to the next tab
this is the Twitter tab this is HTC's
inbuilt Twitter client which is okay
it's a little bit clunky I much prefer
to use a program like touched wit or
TWiki knee so I can go to all tweets and
that's really where you're going to
spend most of your time you can flick
through all of your tweets the last 50
tweets you can change the setting you
can go into the ad replies so you can
see all of your mentions recently your
direct message is there and your
favorites are there now let's say you
want to make a tweet then it gets kind
of cool so we tap up here what are you
doing and we can add a photo we can add
our location or just type out a quick to
tweet it's a very easy way to sort of
not have to open up the Twitter client
you can do it all from really the main
screen with HTC sense so of course if I
tap on a picture there I can choose a
picture to upload and says uploading
photo it does it all in one step okay
and it has uploaded the photo but I'm
going to click back and not send out
that tweet so a pretty good Twitter
client there are some settings if we go
into settings we can change how many
tweets that should download and by
defaults on 50 can also change how often
it downloads new tweets and you can get
to as low as 5 minutes if you are on
Twitter lot you can also choose your URL
shortening hosting your photo post so
pretty good level of control it's not as
robust as other Twitter clients that
I've mentioned few seconds ago to the
right we have HTC footprints and we've
seen this before but the graphics are
amazing watch this I tap on this picture
this beautiful animation comes up the
idea of footprints is that if you travel
a lot you can take a picture of a
monument you see or a restaurant you
like you can add geo coordinates to it
so you can get back to that location
plus you can add some
or a voice note so for example if i
press the + button it's going to bring
up the camera and so i'll take a picture
of the of the HTC case here hot on one
sec okay that wasn't the best picture
and it says gps still searching because
it's trying to reach out get gps
coordinates but i'm indoors of course
right now so i'm going to click stop gps
search and by the way there's some
really cool stuff that this does with
gps and the digital compass that's
coming up in a future video so i'm going
to click done and see what my footprint
looks like there it is if I tap on it
doesn't have much information doesn't
have a phone number or geo coordinates
or a voice note or anything like that
because I just set that up quickly a
good thing for travellers and finally on
the right we have settings and we're not
going to cover settings in this video
because there's a lot of news settings
and I'm sure many of you want to see how
the capacitive screen kind of interplays
with the standard windows mobile stuff
and we're going to show that soon but
that was just a look at the new HTC
Sense which does a fantastic job and
really bringing the device to life and
taking advantage of the one gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor so we have
a lot more coming up on the HTC hd2 be
sure to follow us on Twitter to know
right when the new video hits
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
