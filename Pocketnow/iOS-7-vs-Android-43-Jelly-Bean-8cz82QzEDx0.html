latest version of iOS compares to the
latest version of Android hi I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is iOS
7 versus Android 4.3 in the last week
alone Android turned five years old and
iowa's underwent the single most
important update in its history the
latest respective versions of the two
platforms 4.3 jelly bean and iOS 7 are
now quite distant from their original
versions we figured what better time to
put these two under the microscope and
compare them than now when Iowa 7 was
first announced and released to
developers as a beta in June the typical
finger-pointing ensued but we're beyond
that point we're better than
finger-pointing and tattling it's whiny
and childish so rather than focusing on
who did what first let's focus on what
truly matters who does what best at the
surface the two operating systems have a
lot in common
both are lunging towards minimalist
design and beautiful typography so we
can't knock them for looking too much
alike but commend all the designers for
making them look as simple and beautiful
lock screens admittedly look a lot alike
but Android uses widgets while iOS shows
a beautiful stream of missed
notifications both come with quick
camera shortcuts as well the iOS
homescreen is nothing more than a grid
of icons and folders it always has been
you can't put your icons just anywhere
though they're aligned left to right top
to bottom 20 icons and folders can be
added to each homescreen before another
is created and four can be arranged
among the static dock at the bottom
folders are now paginated without a hard
limitation on how many apps can be added
Android is still utilizing the same old
interface it's been using all along as
well 5 home screens with the default set
to the middle page it's a 4 by 4 grid
that offers 16 slots for either app
shortcuts folders or widgets widgets and
icons can be added by opening the app
drawer long pressing and dragging to the
desired location on the home screen and
folders by dragging an icon atop another
icon and releasing the dock on the
bottom of the Android home screen has
also composed of four user definable
slides pull down from the top of the
display on both platforms to reveal
notifications Notification Center on iOS
7 was given a significant facelift with
the today view for calendar
stocks dismissing notifications in
Android however is much easier simply
flick left or right or hit the dismiss
all button and Notification Center you
must choose each section of
notifications at a time by hitting the
tiny Clear button twice Android still
does notifications better the status bar
indicates that you have notifications
waiting to be attended to a notification
previews are much less obtrusive ioss
banner notifications continue to cover
UI elements though a simple upward flick
will dismiss the banner but the
notifications are still disjointed badge
notifications are very loosely tied to
what's in Notification Center but a
badge indicating pending notifications
for a specific app does in no way entice
us to pull down the notification shade
it's still not unified in any way for
quick controls pull down from the top of
the display in Android with two fingers
or tap the icon in the upper right
corner of the notification shade on iOS
command center is accessed by pulling up
from the bottom of the display androids
panel looks better and is implemented a
little better but command center
actually has more toggles and controls
iOS now uses a bright and vibrant color
palette with whitespace design meaning
it's very light filling with tons of
whites pastels and neons Android is
similar in that it uses a sort of neon
blue as an accent color with thin lines
and typeface but its primary color for
backgrounds buttons and other elements
is black both have their own live or
dynamic wallpapers in iOS 7 is all about
layers sort of like ogres or parfaits
your choice the parallax effect as well
as the transparency of control center
and Notification Center create dimension
something Android does to an extent but
not as noticeably at times they feel
like polar opposites other times they
feel very much alike as if years down
the road the two could become nearly
indistinguishable but there's a trick
Android has that iOS doesn't if you
don't like how I OS seven looks tough
cookie swap your wallpaper and get over
it or jailbreak when it's available on
Android just change the launcher swap
the eye contact apply a theme or install
a different ROM Android for the most
part has ultimately been about function
over form whereas iOS is generally the
opposite Android has only recently been
considered by many to be fairly user
friendly but iOS has always had a
reputation for simplicity that penchant
for simplicity has come at the expense
of sheer function sadly everything is
locked down in sandbox forcing users to
jump around the OS to do simple tasks
for those who value the utmost function
Android has more to offer information
such as pictures or links can be shared
between multiple applications without
ever having to return home or tasks
which hit the universal share button and
a list of compatible applications will
appear on iOS there is only a preset
number of applications and services you
can share from within any app for
instance if you want to share a picture
to Instagram from the gallery on Android
simply navigate to the picture hit share
and select Instagram from iOS you will
need to leave the Photos app open
Instagram compose press the gallery
button find the photo again and then
proceed with the process the only reason
I can share to buffer from within feedly
using an iPhone is because feedly has
hard-coded buffer support into the app
itself which is nice but if I want to
share something from within Safari to
buffer say a link and a quote from the
article I have to copy the link switch
to buffer switch back to Safari I copied
the quote switch back to buffer one more
time paste and buffer from Android to do
this from Chrome I simply have to copy
the quote hit action overflow select add
to buffer paste the quote and buffer no
app switching no nonsense unless we
forget Android has the utmost utility on
the lockscreen and home screen widgets
or at a glance information from your
favorite apps I could read my entire RSS
feed on Android without ever actually
opening an app there is no at a glance
information on iOS unless you count the
dynamic icons such as the standard clock
or calendar app but they're so small
their utility is limited and that gets
us to multitasking before multitasking
on iOS worked but it was clunky poorly
implemented and made it a chore to close
applications Androids wasn't much better
back in the day until Matias Duarte came
along and added the card view
multitasking with swipe gestures to
close Apple also implemented a card view
in the task switcher with gestures for
quickly closing apps aside from the fact
that most Android phones have a
dedicated key for recent apps the two
are virtually neck-and-neck for task
switching now kudos Apple their
respective ecosystems and applica
catalogs can't go unstated either those
play a major part in functionality as
well google has a broader online
ecosystem which can be accessed on
either platform almost in its entirety
gmail calendar contacts Google+ Drive
play movies and TV YouTube and much more
but using Google services on its own
platform is rewarding you don't get that
level of integration or polished offered
by the native Gmail Apple and Android
with Gmail on iOS Apple's ecosystem has
the heavyweight iTunes iCloud and one of
the richest selections of digital
content available both are easy to get
sucked into and difficult to get out of
but we can try to break down the massive
application support for both major
titles and developers often provide
support for both platforms as of July
Google Play offered over 1 million
applications and games Apple's App Store
reportedly passed the 950,000 app
threshold just two days ago if you can
tell a difference in the quality or
quantity of either just by sifting
through them you're not human
iOS typically has more game support but
Android store is also filled with lots
of customization software wallpapers
icon packs themes launchers etc then
there's Siri and Google now both are
easy to access and tied to the home
button but the general consensus is that
Google now is more useful in many ways
both can be used to compose emails text
and make requests about the area around
you where to shop where to get food
movie times etc but Google now provides
information without user input it learns
you and if you don't like speaking to
your phone you can simply type a request
into Google now but series latest tricks
such as hardware control is certainly
noteworthy finally performance iOS
really hasn't had performance problems
ever of which we can recall at least
sure Iowa 7 may not run well on your
iPhone 4 or iOS 6 may have bought your
3GS down but iOS has always been very
well polished and offered a buttery
smooth experience on relevant Hardware
that's more that can be said for Android
which was once synonymous with lag and
stutters jellybean has all but solved
that problem project butter has
dramatically changed the performance of
Android it's smooth and now offers
similar performance to what many have
grown to expect from other platforms
like Windows Phone or iOS so we leave
you with a question to end all question
jellybean or ios7 normally I would give
you a definitive answer but that
wouldn't be fun now would it
so we'll say this for simplicity and
reliability we give it to iOS 7 but for
customizability functionality and
appearance Android jelly bean takes the
cake that's gonna do it for this video
