pocketnow.com 2010 was the year of the
Samsung Galaxy S we found it on every
major carrier
it was a hot device had great battery
life great performance really thin form
factors and in 2011 samsung is back with
their new flagship the galaxy s2 this
phone ups the ante in every respect it's
faster it's thinner it has a bigger
screen and in this video we're going to
unbox the galaxy s2 let's get to it ok
so here we go so a lot of improvements
to talk about between the galaxy s and
the galaxy s2 we've got the new Exynos
processor I'm not sure if I'm saying
that right the 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Samsung proprietary process that goes
right up against the snapdragon 1.2
gigahertz processor coming out on the
HTC Sensation I've got some extra
packaging here and thanks to our friends
at clove Co UK for sending us the unit 2
review right now this phone is 440
British pounds which is about seven
hundred and twenty-two dollars yes it's
very expensive but hey it'll actually
work on the on us ATT frequencies so
that's an added little bonus there and
plus this is a device that just came out
so you got to expect the press to be
very high very likely that this phone
will see release on all major US and
international carriers so you can keep
an eye out for lower subsidized prices
so here it is small little box galaxy s2
1.2 gigahertz this is incredible the
previous Galaxy S had a single core 1
gigahertz processor and now we're going
to 1.2 gigahertz and having two cores
this is going to be awesome let's take a
look what we have on the back here dual
core 8 megapixel camera this shoots
1080p video and it can also play it back
in 1080p if you connect it to a
television we've got DLNA support a huge
1650 milliamp hour battery and the
interesting thing about that is that
this device is the thinnest smartphone
you can buy right now it's a little bit
over 8 millimeters thick it's got the
Super AMOLED plus screen you can tell
the time
excited about this Samsung had the
super-mo LED debut in the galaxy s
devices now they're going with the plus
they also made the screen bigger this
screen is going to be all inspiring
we're thinking the only problem with it
is that the screen is WVGA resolution
it's not qHD like all the higher-end
devices are coming with but maybe the
the Super AMOLED plus will be so nice
that we won't even care comes with 16
gigs of internal memory
we've got Wi-Fi a B G and n Android 2.3
you get the point let's let's break the
seal here there's no turning back now
and open up this little tiny box Wow
social hub premium GPS ok let's just see
what comes in the box
this thing is remarkably thin and I wish
you can actually be here holding it I
just have to stop and just comment on
this I cannot believe how thin this
phone is it's so powerful it's got such
a big screen and yet it is thinner than
any phone I've ever held Wow this is
unbelievable it's pencil thin ok let's
see what else is in the box before you
know going crazy about the thickness of
the phone we've got headphones which is
nice kind of nice looking headphones
with little chrome pieces there let's
see we've got a micro USB charger which
is nice
of course the European plug but your
standard plugs will work with that if
you plan to use this in the US extra
earbuds and here's the quite large
sixteen hundred and fifty million power
battery this function a pretty
impressive battery life and what we're
going to do is put the battery in I'm
going to get an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and plug
it in immediately so we can do the first
time boot up on the beautifully thin
Samsung Galaxy S 2 and let's just take a
look at the front we're getting a lot of
reflection from here so off tak turn off
some of the lights but what's
interesting is that you can't see any
buttons when the phone's off kind of
like the Nexus S we've got the back
button here we've got the home button
without a home logo on it so kind of a
very sleek looking design oh it looks
too much like an iPhone Apple might get
mad by that but maybe not and we've got
the menu button here on the left
front-facing camera let's get a SIM card
in here let's get the battery in we'll
be right back
all right SIM cards in battery is in
this thing is very very light even with
the SIM card and usually the problem
with light is it feels cheap this phone
does not feel cheap okay so let's try to
pop on the back battery cover by the way
back here we've got this really
interesting textured plastic maybe you
can see it in the light it's got these
raised little bumps that give it a good
in hand feel we've got sort of a reverse
chin here usually the chin occurs on the
front speaker here doesn't look like it
as dual speakers we've got a you know
something to connect a lanyard loop to
we've got a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack secondary mic for noise
cancellation it is just amazing how thin
this thing is power standby button on
the left that's a little bit different
than Samsung had been doing usually they
put the button on the top so let's press
and hold that and while that's booting
up let's compare that to some other
devices so here we've got the htc
inspire 4G and it's got a little bit of
fingerprints on here but it did in a
second ago kind of weird so the inspire
4G was one of the thinnest phones to
come out it's basically the Desire HD
which was HTC's flagship of last year
and let's see how they compare in terms
of thickness there's no contest here the
Desire HD is about 12 millimeters thick
which is quite thin but again we're
going at under 9 millimeters on the
galaxy s 2 so it's just it's amazing how
much thinner it is so here we have a
network does it provide dayton time ok
great
it's kind of up there we go just turn to
3g so we're getting 3g network
connectivity here on AT&amp;amp;T we'll zoom in
a little bit a lot of options here
automatic will go through this later
there seems to be no confirm button so
if I hit the back button and I'll do
change language the United States it's
really cool to see the Super AMOLED plus
screen on such a large display all of
the Galaxy S phones came with a 4-inch
display so it's very interesting to see
such incredible contrast over a large
display let's see if we can kind of get
out
here guess we're gonna have to go
through this okay we'll do all of this
in a little bit and we'll show you what
it's like
again let's let's bring out some other
devices to compare with before we
actually do that
turn that off over here is the iPhone 4
which is starting to look kind of small
in comparison to these devices that have
these big bright 4.3 inch displays so
we've got the front facing camera al
that looks a lot bigger here on the
galaxy s 2 in terms of thickness the
galaxy s 2 is thinner than the iPhone 4
which is a tremendous feat considering
the iPhone 4 like the Desire HD is one
of the thinnest devices out there also
next to another device that has a 4.3
inch screen the Big Daddy the HTC
Thunderbolt of course the galaxy s2 does
not have 4G although it's very likely in
2011 and 2012 we're going to see
versions of the galaxy s2 come out with
LTE and HSPA+ and WiMAX and all of those
good radio technologies all right so I
put in the Google account information
and what we have here is the new version
of TouchWiz TouchWiz 4 which is
Samsung's proprietary interface now a
lot of people after they got the galaxy
s devices put on a third-party launcher
like launcher pro or ADW launcher
because the galaxy s devices had this
weird TouchWiz interface it wasn't that
fast it wasn't that usable but it looks
like Samsung has really gone above and
beyond with their new interface the
program tray looks about the same but
they've got these new widgets that kind
of stick together we're obviously gonna
have to spend some time with this and
we're gonna have a full video that talks
all about what it's like to use TouchWiz
4 and here's something cool move device
left or right while holding a selected
icon to reposition to another page that
is pretty cool so if we tap and hold and
we tilt apparently if there's a feature
that makes it a lot easier well that
looks awesome there's a feature that
makes it a lot easier to move widgets
from homescreen to homescreen right now
we're getting HSDPA on AT&amp;amp;T we should be
getting faster data speeds than you can
get onto the Atrix 4G and the inspire 4G
because those devices don't seem to even
advantage of HSDPA speeds so this might
be a killer device to get on AT&amp;amp;T if you
don't want to wait it will work on
t-mobile but you won't get the 3G
connectivity we've got a ton more coming
up on the Samsung Galaxy S 2 it's really
exciting for us to test one of the
flagship devices of 2011
HTC's coming out of the gate with a
sensation in the near future and Samsung
is coming out of the gate with the Galle
galaxy s 2 Super AMOLED plus screen 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor it's
pretty awesome if you liked this video
please give us a thumbs up and if you
think I was too enthusiastic about this
phone please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching we'll be back soon
with more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
