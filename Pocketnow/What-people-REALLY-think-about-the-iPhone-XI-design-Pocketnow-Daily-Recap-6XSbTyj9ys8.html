see my comment featured well what dan
Hamish shiny face oh I can raise the
volume on that airmiles ravenna yeah
it's kind of the way it goes that's
right it's that time of the week I'm hey
meta leave it out this is PocketNow and
this is organizing lis recap your
comments for last week so on Monday the
topic where the possible changes to the
iPhone 11 including a better modem since
connectivity is not really a stronghold
of iPhones I asked you what your
experience is so far we had 409 comments
yeah my iphone is constantly at one bar
when my friends have full bars
connectivity doesn't matter anyways
gonna switch to the Samsung Note 10
years the king of bars last year
if qualcomm will be supplying modems to
Apple again iPhone users should wait
until next year that is something that I
would totally do I bought and returned
my tennis match due to its inactivity my
galaxy note 5 had much faster Wi-Fi
speeds Wow really that's that's an old
phone man but on Tuesday the topic was
Google i/o we were in Mountain View we
had a lot of fun we actually did a full
vlog of video that went live last Sunday
I asked you what did you like the most
about Google i/o we had 412 comments
pixel 3 a excel best feature equals no
ugly notch dude I you know I can't even
begin to tell you how much there
shouldn't be anything that I should like
about the 3a but what I like the most
about it is the screen its god you're so
right made of support for dark notice
what's most enticing about Android q
quiche anyone yeah I think it's gonna be
quiche what other name do you guys think
could be available I don't think there's
any other I guess best Google IO
announcement 10 times faster at Google
assistant oh my god yes I you know
obviously it's still far for that to
happen but that is gonna be epic you
know when they said yeah we're going to
show you something that's faster than
actually using your phone I thought they
were kidding they were not but on
Wednesday the topic was foldables we
were still at Google i/o we saw a ton of
mock-ups of foldables and I asked you I
mean do you really feel that there is a
market for foldables we have 372 common
I don't think the fold is necessary for
functionality but I think it is
necessary for growing the industry which
has become relatively stagnant and
really declining amen exactly I
I feel that it's you know it's good
bragging rights and they are cool
products I just you don't need them but
they're cool maybe foldable phones will
be the standard soon if people can
afford them
exactly whenever they drop the price I I
agree I mean I don't understand I I do
get it there are a ton of moving parts
but the market is just not designed for
a price like that
if the fold was cheaper and worked I'd
get one and ditch my tablet I definitely
see a need for them but whether I'm but
whether I'm willing to compromise enough
is unclear yeah and definitely the
biggest compromise is the price I mean
are you truly getting two thousand
dollars worth of a gadget as the
question and then on Thursday the topic
was I'm just gonna scratch my head with
these stove leaks of the iPhone 11 are
they growing on you
we have 372 comments google ugliest
front design Apple hold my beer comes
out with the worst back design oh my god
yeah if only they happened on the same
year but you know what regardless I mean
sure the notch on the pixel is terrible
the camera hump on current iPhones is
terrible as well it's atrocious but it
will sadly become a trend oh man yeah
we've got a blame whoo wall we still
design looks like saggy butt cheeks
great video by the way
Diego picked this comment
and then on Friday the topic was
controversial
obviously the tariffs the raising prices
because of taxes I asked you if you
think that it's fair that we should be
paying for these taxes and we weren't
the people that chose to manufacture
phones in China we had 468 comments
Apple why are our sales and profits down
also Apple let's up our prices that'll
solve it yeah sadly and you know it's a
downward spiral that companies do
whenever their sales start dropping
obviously that means the man drops and
so what they do is raise the price which
is stupid it should be the other way
around I wonder how many sales Apple
would get if they lowered their starting
prices you know I'm really curious to
see the performance as of next quarter
because they've been doing deals for the
past weeks
now these import taxes become permanent
Foxconn will move from China to India
they have there are already iPhones
being built in India I believe the
iPhone 6s is one of them so I feel that
that's something that should happen I
mean it's not our fault why should we
pay for it that's it for the pocket now
