iPhone 10 is a rather interesting
endeavor we're not just talking about
differences in operating system there
are also substantial differences in the
price tag it would almost seem like an
unfair comparison but it's not these are
two of the best flagships in the market
today and it's time to place them
head-to-head I'm how you met Aviva NAT
with pocket now when this is 1 + 6 vs
iPhone 10s reviewed this iPhone 10 is
literally twice the price at the 1 + 6 +
2 finding if you're really getting twice
the value is a very interesting
combination of factors the hardware
story is both similar and different and
yet a spot where I'd call this when it's
high you have glass on glass on both
devices with the oneplus 6 using a more
conventional aluminum trim for
sustainless steel on the iPhone 10 this
actually makes the iPhone feel heavier
in the hand but with the major problem
that stainless steel doesn't really age
well even if you're using a case the
oneplus 6 offers more color options with
this red being my favorite in addition
to this matte black treatment that I
also praised regardless both devices are
fragile so make sure you buy yourself a
case with this carbon fiber option on
the oneplus 6 being my favorites and
then the retro spigen cases of the
iPhone 10 being as well the 1 + 6 is
also a larger phone we're talking 12
millimeters taller 5 millimeters wider
and 3 grams heavier but the thickness
almost being identical this allows a
larger six point two inch display when
compared to five point eight inches even
if the iPhone has 50 more pixels per
inch than the 1 + 6 both devices sports
similar OLED technology meaning vibrant
color comes standard on both differences
are really the HDR 10 certification on
the iPhone with the oneplus 6 only
claiming the DCI p3 color gamut that the
iPhone also has the iPhone definitely
wins in sporting duel firing speakers
for improved content consumption
when compared to the single firing
speaker on the one plus six but then the
one plus six wins in the fact that it
hides the notch when watching fullscreen
video where the iPhone is extremely
annoying where the comparison tilts
dramatically as if we were to compare
internals even if that's kind of
pointless I mean the one plus six
continues to be one of the proud few
devices to support a whopping eight gigs
of ram it also beats the iPhone when it
comes to dual-sim capabilities a larger
battery and the inclusion of the beloved
headphone jack storage options are
almost the same and the inclusion of the
hardware mutes which is also the same
really the only spot where the iPhone
wins is because it does have an IP
rating for water resistance and also
wireless charging the oneplus 6 does not
have an IP rating but we do know that it
is water-resistant and even if it
doesn't have wireless charging there is
a vet charging in the Box where if the
iPhone doesn't include any fast charging
options in the box and if you do you
have to pay an extra 75 bucks for them
now the reason why comparing
specifications is pointless is given the
differences in operating system iOS 11
is a far leaner
animal than Android 8.1 Oreo even with
all the one-plus optimizations to the
experience I'm not saying that either
one is better than the other I'm saying
that the variations and experience are
well compensated by the spec sheet
offered by each manufacturer now my
personal favorite is definitely oxygen
OS / Android mainly because of its
flexibility wand buttons on your UI or
gestures both options are available and
then there's the general flexibility of
Android wear if you don't like the
gestures there are third-party solutions
from xda-developers third-party
launchers etc iOS 11 is well just this
Apple intense the usual grid of icons
you'll either find useful or boring
there are definitely added benefits of
your own products from the Apple
ecosystem which is not the same story
when it comes to owning Android phones
gestures on the iPhone are definitely
one of my favorite features with a quick
and easy way to switch back and forth
between apps
seriously calling a winner depends on
your preference but I personally
gravitate more to giving this one to one
Plus given the flexibility using both
devices on a daily basis is also a spot
where I'd give this one to one plus the
one plus six has proven to significantly
outperform the iPhone 10 when it comes
to battery life I seriously don't really
worry about reaching end of day here
we're in the case of the iPhone that is
seriously hit or miss phone calls are
pretty much the same on both with crisp
sound on both the earpiece and the
speakers as well and then when it comes
to gaming wealth both devices are the
most capable out there when it comes to
their respective ecosystems
I like the gaming mode on the 1 plus 6
and more because it helps you not get
the stir while you play but that being
said Apple has proven to always have the
edge in getting the cooler games first
when compared to Android now the
department that I never thought that I'd
give the win to oneplus over an iPhone
is with the camera usually the main
price differentiator to buy an expensive
flagship is the camera experience but
the iPhone 10 is just clearly behind
this is actually the first time that a
oneplus phone wins this comparison I'm
not saying that the iPhone 10 photos are
bad in the contrary they are very good
in almost every scenario you throw at it
but once you stack them side-by-side
when compared to the 1 plus 6 you'll
notice the differences meter for a
closed subject and notice the blown
highlights on the iPhone 10 and notice
the balanced color when it comes to the
1 plus 6 you also have more megapixels
on the camera of the 1 plus 6 so there
is more detail in each shot now thus
claimer I have noticed significant
improvements in this department after
some recent software updates so my
impressions on the review actually have
gotten a lot better after this
comparison and the same goes for
portrait mode not just for selfies in
general I've noticed far better detail
from the oneplus 6 and it could just be
given the added megapixels plus the
software enhancements
now when it comes to video I will have
to say that the iPhone 10 continues to
be my favorite solution I do notice more
detail up to the point where you'd be
shocked at the amount of videos that
we've used an iPhone as a secondary
camera that being said the one plus 6 is
no slouch it's also capable of 4k video
at 60 frames per second and holds the
edge at doubling the frame rate when it
comes to super slow-mo when compared to
the iPhone 10 to conclude I think the
theme of this video is clear both
devices have great hardware I have a
slight preference of the software of
oxygen OS on Android and and just about
everything else the comparison is very
tight I do have to declare a winner
though and the major tiebreaker here is
the price tag
why pay $1,000 for a phone when you can
get a similar if not a better experience
for nearly half the price with the one
plus 6 heck if you were to break the
back of the iPhone 10 it'll be cheaper
for you to buy a 1 plus 6 with the same
amount of money that it would take for
you to fix the iPhone 10 seriously again
this is almost an unfair comparison
once again I'm not calling the iPhone 10
a bad phone it's a great phone but the
oneplus 6 here helps me reconfirm my
initial review verdict of it being
overpriced for what you get
honestly if this were my money I would
definitely buy a 1 plus 6 instead
