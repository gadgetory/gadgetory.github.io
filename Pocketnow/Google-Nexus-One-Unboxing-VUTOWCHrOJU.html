pocketnow.com
this is the unboxing of the Google Nexus
One the true Google phone made by HTC
it's running on Android 2.1 and it's got
a lot of stuff that other Android phones
don't have which probably makes it the
best Android phone even get right now
it's got a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor a large M OLED
screen which probably means great
battery life and really vivid colors and
excellent contrast so let's take a look
at the unboxing experience of the Nexus
One the true Google phone this is being
sold right now five hundred and thirty
dollars unlocked or you can get it on
t-mobile where it will work on their 3G
network for about a hundred and eighty
dollars with a two-year agreement you
can use this on AT&amp;amp;T as I'm going to
although you won't be able to get 3G it
just edged data so not much in the Box
except for a package that looks very
very similar to the HTC hd2 this is
really gorgeous packaging on the edges
of the box here you get kind of the
Google colors a green yellow red and
blue and it just says Nexus One on the
back alright and let's open this up it's
coming out very slowly there Wow
beautiful same kind of display that you
get on the HTC hd2 although the hd2 box
opens kind of long ways this opens sort
of right towards the front the device is
nicely displayed right here in the front
we're gonna take a look at the device in
a minute let's see what kind of
accessories we get with the Nexus One we
get a little pouch which has the little
Android logo on it which is quite nice
it's not leather it's sort of vinyl but
it's nice they included a pouch
let's see some instructions here insert
the battery charge the phone until
notification light turns green sort of
with the Google colors there we have a
warranty statement and I'm assuming the
rest is going to be kind of the standard
HTC accessories and it is so we get the
the headphones here we get a battery
says HTC innovation let's take a look at
the side
it's about 1,400 milliamp hours yeah
it's 1,400 million powers so should have
quite good battery life compared to
other Android devices out there and then
we have the syncing and charging adapter
which looks to use I think that's micro
USB so that's good nice and standard and
then we have the wall charger the u.s.
wall charger not international which is
great so let's take a look at the Google
phone the Nexus One and compare it to
other devices so let's see what it says
on the front Wow
very very thin they're not kidding when
they say it's the same width as a pencil
let's see welcome to Nexus One enjoy
your favorite Google apps and more all
at your fingertips to learn more about
your phone and all its goodies please
visit google.com slash phone very nice
since it's made from HTC we're expecting
the hardware build quality to be quite
fantastic and they allow you to engrave
the Nexus One on the back but I chose
not to do that I can actually have two
lines of engraving which is quite cool
to get the personal touch alright so a
big huge Google logo on the back it's
almost secondary to the HTC logo we've
got a 5 megapixel camera with a flash
very small device definitely super thin
it's a little bit thicker than the HTC
hd2 nice large touchscreen a trackball
here which actually illuminates in
various colours for system notifications
overall a nice feel in hand it's got a
kind of rubbery back coating here so
it's not going to be a fingerprint
magnet and hopefully they have sort of
an anti oil coating on the screen like
they do on the HD 2 so let's take a look
at the Nexus One compared to other
devices here it is next to the HTC hd2
so obviously the HD 2 is a much much
larger screen but the HD 2 is also a
little bit thinner than the Nexus 1 but
the Nexus 1 is quite thin and petite
let's take a look at it next to a dummy
model at the HTC click this is another
Android device this is also known as the
HTC tattoo so definitely the Nexus One
is a larger device than is the tattoo
let's take a look at it next to the HTC
Touch pro2 which has a slightly
our screen at 3.7 inches compared a
three point three point six on the touch
pro2 and three point seven on the Nexus
One the Nexus One is a capacitive AMOLED
display which should be quite fantastic
and obviously the Nexus One has no
keyboard and so it's going to be a lot
thinner about eleven point five
millimeters to be exact so a lot more
coming up on the Google Nexus One I know
a lot of people are curious about the
added software that Google has brought
to the table the features of Android 2.1
and sort of the overall hardware
experience with this fantastic AMOLED
capacitive display we'll be back soon
with more on the Google Nexus One that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
