Nokia Lumia 822 and the Nokia Lumia 810
here at PocketNow so it only follows
that we should now review the device
both of those were based on I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
quick review of the Nokia Lumia 820 480
in our written quick review we call the
Lumia 820 a block of solid technology
and that's appropriate
it's a 160 gram nine point nine
millimeter thick device that feels
simultaneously heavier and thinner then
it's dimensions suggest the combination
of straight lines with sensible curves
and small radius corners gives the 820 a
more grown-up authentically premium feel
then it's siblings on Verizon and
t-mobile that's helped along by the
matte black cover on the back but
careful
it's slippery and there's no Gorilla
Glass protecting the display if you drop
this device speaking of that display
it's the same 4.3 inch AMOLED panel at
800 by 480 resolution that we saw on the
810 and the eight 22 as before
saturation and viewing angles are quite
good but the low pixel density gives it
a dated appearance if you get too close
still that high saturation paired with
those deep blacks really makes Windows
Phone 8 pop the tiles appear to float
right on the surface of the glass under
the hood which is tough to pry off until
you learn its secrets you get a
removable 1650 milliamp hour battery as
well as expandable microSD storage to
shore up the eight gigs of internal
memory that's in addition to a dual-core
Qualcomm s4 CPU running at 1.5 gigahertz
and backed up by a gig of ram an 8
megapixel primary and VGA front-facing
camera and LTE support for a TTS 4G
network in all the Lumia 820 might not
pack the biggest punch in terms of raw
hardware but it's more than enough to
run Windows Phone 8 and look very very
classy doing it and the hardware runs
Windows Phone 8 just as well as you'd
expect which is to say excellently
Windows Phone 8 has proved just as
stable responsive and fluid as Windows
Phone 7 on every device we've tested so
far and the Lumia 820 is no exception no
matter how many live tiles you're
running no matter how many tabs you've
got open an Internet Explorer 10 no
matter how many planes you crash and
rise of glory performance is
consistently top-notch the 820 kept up
well with its contemporaries and with
other mid-range smartphones in our
testing calling was solid both over
earpiece and speakerphone data speeds
over 18 T's LTE network were excellent
especially on the upside where we
averaged about 14 megabits per second
and battery life was quite good the 820
lasted 2 hours and 11 minutes on the WP
bench stress test and that's slightly
lower than the Lumia 920's score of 2
hours and 30 minutes but the 820 was
also a real champ on standby lasting 24
hours with light use even while
constantly connected to LTE we're
getting used to solid camera performance
on Lumia devices and the 820 delivers
just like its siblings even though it
doesn't have PureView branding or the
optical image stabilization of the Lumia
920 the 820 s shooter delivers good
stills as long as we use Nokia's scenes
option in the camera viewfinder once you
get used to tweaking the camera using
those options it can deliver some really
really nice shots for a smartphone and
once again low-light is where it really
shines just don't rely on the VGA
front-facing camera to deliver anything
but disappointment it's pretty bad the
Lumia 820 may not have the high-end
features buzz or looks of its higher-end
cousin the 920 but for $50 cheaper it
doesn't need to for $49.99 on contract
you get a Windows Phone 8 device with
beautiful industrial design solid
features the full suite of Nokia
exclusive apps and a great camera it's
still a mid-range phone
it's got last year's display with no
gorilla glass and bad front-facing
camera and it makes compromises on
storage and battery capacity but if
those aren't deal-breakers this is a
solid Windows Phone for the price we
give the AT&amp;amp;T Nokia Lumia 820 a 7 out of
10
