in this last video installment comparing
a droid 2 point 0 to windows mobile 6.5
with touchflo 3d we're going to go ahead
and look at these settings programs and
marketplace and how those differ between
the two devices and operating systems in
the first video we explored the user
interface the voice command feature any
multimedia capabilities of both devices
we've explored also the email and
calendar applications in the second
video and in this last video let's go
ahead and unlock android first we're
going to go ahead and take a look at the
settings menu here you see a graphical
user interface on touchflo 3 or on
windows mobile 6.5 if you do set a
password it will be either a numeric or
alpha numeric pin so in order to access
settings all you have to do is hit the
settings menu which brings up a
contextual menu where you can have
different options so we're going to go
ahead and tap settings under settings
you have different options including
wireless network to connect to bluetooth
and Wi-Fi and you can manage devices
that way you have call settings for
voicemail hearing aids sounds and
location and a variety of different
things the settings menu is highly touch
sensitive you have large boxes to select
from you have pull down boxes and
options and radio buttons as well so
let's go ahead and go into your location
and security so everything is very touch
friendly the program's menu the main
programs menu other than the shortcuts
and widgets that you see on the three
home screens here is accessible by
either tapping on this arrow or swiping
and pulling it up in this way you see
all the different programs that are
installed you do have kinetic scrolling
so it offers you some speed as you
scroll from the top to the bottom of a
very long list one of the programs here
is a market android market which is a
marketplace application where you can
download applications paid and freed
applications both at the main screen
here you have a list view of some of the
feature applications more applications
are available under apps games and
Verizon has its own branded app store
inside android market so let's go ahead
and begin with apps by tapping on that
you do have different applications genre
such as news and weather multimedia
we're going to go ahead and tap on news
and downloading an app is pretty simple
go ahead and we're going to go ahead and
download a free app and we're going to
download weatherbug gives you a warning
comments and ratings and then if you tap
install it will show you that weatherbug
will require access to your location
which uses GPS your network
communications for internet and some of
the system tools we're going to go ahead
and just accept that and it will begin
installing once the program starts
installing it shows up at the top
notification bar so let's go ahead and
swipe down it will show you the progress
here of installation and once it's
completed you just tap on it and you can
either uninstall it or open it
let's go ahead and instead of wait for
it to load we're going to go back to the
home screen opening an application is
very easy all you have to do is just tap
on the application and it should open
we're going to go ahead and go to our
phone application and show you some of
the nifty things that the phone app does
oops under the phone app unfortunately
it does not use on contextual dialing so
if you typed in say dad 323 which spells
da d it doesn't pull up dad there's a
pretty detailed call log but under your
contacts the cool part is if you tap on
a contact it will show you all the
different ways you can communicate with
that contact including look placing a
call looking up their contact card
emailing text message you can even
navigate to that person if their address
is saved or look up their facebook
profile as well and you can do that in
also the text message or any application
where the content or the contact name is
selected so that's a quick look at the
settings programs and marketplace for
android let's go ahead and do the same
for windows mobile 6.5 with touchflo 3d
in order to go to these settings you can
just quickly tap on settings here or you
can go to programs the shortcuts and tap
on settings that way this pulls up the
main touchflo 3d settings and some of
these settings that you can control via
touchflo 3d but if you want deeper
control you will have to hit all
settings and then once you go deeper in
it becomes less finger friendly and it
looks like there's a bit of a disparity
between windows mobile 6.5 with all the
touch implementation and it looks like
here we're taking back to an interface
that is reminiscent of windows mobile
6.1 with the tabs and the small buttons
that are more stylist capable than
finger capable to access the main
programs all you have to do is hit the
start by nor the windows button here or
you can do it with the on screen on the
left side this brings up a shortcut on
touchflo 3d if you hit on all
applications you get a grid or a list
view rather than the grid view and you
can pull up different applications let's
go ahead and take a look at marketplace
for mobile which is the app store for
windows mobile instead of the list view
here with all these showcase
applications you have it in like a
carousel view here at the top and then
here you can log in with your live ID by
going into the menu let's go ahead and
go to what's new and see what we can
download that's free let's go ahead and
download glympse because that looks to
be free and again you can browse by
genre as well and it looks like it's
initiating the download and it takes you
back so that you're not on that screen
so you can browse for more applications
you can download simultaneous apps as
well and view screen shots and reviews
here
and we're going to wait for this to
finish downloading marketplace will also
automatically download your applications
updates if there are any as well and you
can rate your application at the top
here
can sign in or sign out looks like
installing a little but this has been a
quick look of marketplace some of the
programs and settings on both windows
mobile and android 2.0 thanks for
watching and stay tuned for additional
android and windows mobile coverage on
