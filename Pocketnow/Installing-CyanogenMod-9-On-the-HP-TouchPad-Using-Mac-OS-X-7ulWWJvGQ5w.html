pocketnow.com today we're gonna do a
quick step-by-step run-through of how to
install Android Ice Cream Sandwich on
the HP TouchPad tablet now some of you
might remember the touchpad was going to
be the spearhead of HP's big push into
the tablet market with the operating
system they inherited from Palm called
webOS when HP cancelled those plans they
put the touchpad on fire sale for
ridiculously low prices and the rush was
on to port the more powerful Android
tablet platform to the device and thanks
for the efforts of the CyanogenMod team
it's now possible to run Android 4.0 on
the HP TouchPad let's see how now since
we're focusing on an OS 10 install of
Android on the HP TouchPad today what
we're going to need is an Apple
Macintosh computer the HP TouchPad
itself a USB cable and some good
thoughts so what we want to do first is
drop the touchpad into developer mode
and how we do this is by entering just
type and inputting the Konami code for
all you old-school gamers that should be
very familiar up down up down left right
left right B a start we type that in and
developer mode pops up tap the developer
mode enabler and we're prompted for a
password we can skip that in very short
time
we're dropped into developer mode and
the touchpad is unlocked back to the Mac
we can hop on to the Java website make
sure our Java install is up-to-date if
it's not software update takes care of
that for us next step is going to be
hopping over to webOS nation there's a
thread we're gonna drop into the video
here we want to download the latest
version of the webOS quick install
software the Mac will warn you that it's
not safe go ahead and say it's safe and
here we are next step we're gonna hop on
over to routes wiki dot-com and drop the
URL in there for you as well this is
where we're gonna grab the software
necessary for the rest of the install
scroll on down to the download section
on this page
we're going to grab most of the files
here in the list we want to make sure
not to forget the Google Apps package
because a Google tablet is not terribly
useful without the Google Apps that it
comes with pop the USB cable into the
touchpad and the computer touchpad tells
us there's a USB cable connected do we
want to go into USB mode yes indeed we
do HP TouchPad pops up on our desktop as
an accessible device we're gonna create
a new folder I'm gonna name the folder
CM install and clean it up just to get
it out of the way then we're going to
select those four files that we just
downloaded in the previous step making
sure not to forget the Google Apps ICS
package and drag them over to the CM
install folder that we just created on
the touchpad next we're going to eject
the touchpad from our computer however
we want to make sure that we're not
unplugging the touchpad just yet we need
to leave it plugged in back on the
computer and we're gonna scroll through
our filesystem find folder called opt
then under opt we're gonna find Nova and
we're gonna find bin and we find a bunch
of files in the bin folder that's good
news
next we're gonna do is drag the Acme
installer to file to that folder turning
our attention back to the touchpad we're
gonna go to our settings menu and find
our restart options in the device info
screen there's a lot of reset options
here we're going to do a standard
restart vote this time when we do it
we're gonna hold down the volume key the
volume up button while we do it
so let's do that hold down volume up
press restart and we'll give the device
a second to process that request we get
the spinning HP or above thought and we
should be provided with a large USB icon
there it is next we'll head back to the
computer open up terminal and we're
going to change the directory that we're
working in terminal to the directory
that we just created now if you don't
frequently jam with the console Cowboys
in cyberspace if you like me in other
words you're gonna get a lot of errors
in terminal as you figure out how the
hell to do this kind of very rudimentary
code work particularly if you're new to
the Mac relatively new to the Mac and
you grew up in das but a quick series of
googling and a little bit of trial and
error finally got me to a place where I
could get some results now we're going
to hit enter
watch the HP logo come back and boom
code lots and lots and lots of code the
touchpad is gonna do this for a little
while you're gonna see a lot of stuff
flying by on the screen here it's gonna
take a while it's gonna pause at points
where it just kind of sits there and
stares at you and get a little blinky
cursor there and it doesn't really do
anything leave it alone don't unplug it
don't move it don't look at it funny
just let it be and then it'll start
again you can get a little goofy if you
want and it'll start inflating all these
files and then we see something very
familiar we see the Ice Cream Sandwich
multi-coloured Google rainbow dynamic
shape explosion it's good news because
we've got Android ICS now running on the
HP TouchPad but our work isn't over yet
we want to power the tablet off because
we have to make sure that we are getting
all those Google apps that we were so
focused on installed properly and when
it reboots it's going to give us the
option to boot into webOS boot into
Android or do some other options here we
want to boot into clockworkmod then want
to select install file from zip we're
going to apply the update from the zip
file on quote the SD card go to the top
option there we're using the volume keys
and the HP TouchPad single center button
to select options we're going to scroll
down to the folder called CM install
we're going to choose a zip to apply and
it's going to ask us to confirm cannot
be undone we select yes go back to work
once it's through we'll just go back
select reboot system now the top option
it'll come back we'll select boot into
CyanogenMod so that Android loads again
on the touchpad and before you know it
Android will optimize those applications
that were in
stalled in that package and we have ICS
running again on the touchpad but this
time with the proper suite of Google
Apps that's what we call awesome
well that's it for today's walkthrough
once again I'm Michael Fisher with
pocketnow.com I want to give a quick
shout out though to the folks that
simple help dotnet without whom this
walkthrough probably would not have been
possible they have some excellent
information which we use a lot of in
this and also stay tuned for some
reviews of Android 4.0 on the HP
TouchPad as I spend more time with this
device and more time with this build of
CyanogenMod in the meantime leave us
some comments let us know what you liked
or didn't like be sure to give us a
thumbs up if you did like the video and
stay tuned for more it's pocketnow.com
