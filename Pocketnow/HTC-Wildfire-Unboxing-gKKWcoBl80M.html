now calm and it's time to unbox the HTC
Wildfire smart phone the Wildfire is an
Android device that is really geared
toward the budget-minded consumer with a
very little price tag in a very
affordable price tag for an unlocked
smartphone so rather than keep you
waiting let's just go ahead and jump
right into that unboxing alright and we
are back and as you see right here we
have the shipping package with the HTC
Wildfire here in the shipping envelope
so let's go ahead and rip this guy open
this is a true unboxing it really puts
you here with us as we do the unboxing
so we do get the package start just with
a little bit easier to open all right
now the box itself is very small well
let them say very small but it's smaller
than most and that is because this
device is a smaller form factor than in
most as well looking at the box right
now I'll actually zoom in a little bit
so you can kind of get a better picture
here as you can see it as a bunch of
faces all over the box this box actually
has a striking resemblance to the palm
design to a palm and initially had
changed you with some of their other
devices now looking at the box itself it
got and gives us some highlights here
now it does incorporate HTC Sense so
it's going to talk about the French
stream the fact that you can personally
recommend your apps you have the widgets
which is you know a benefit of the
Android you have the widgets which are a
benefit of the Android OS as well as the
caller ID etc etc now the main thing
here that you want to take a look at is
actually some of these specifications
it's a five hundred twenty eight
megahertz CPU which is a little slower
than what we're used to at this point in
time once again it is a more consumer
friendly device which that means with
lower price comes lower spec it is
preloaded with Android 2.1 as well as
HTC Sense now the main thing you do want
to take away from here is that it is a
3.2 inch touchscreen so it's a little
smaller than most of the phones that
we've been using as of late such as the
Samsung Galaxy S and the HTC
for gee now let's go ahead and cut the
tape and get this guy fully open now the
box just slides right open right here to
actually show you your device now we've
actually gone ahead and opened the box
up it shares a very striking resemblance
to the Google Nexus One packaging
granted it is smaller to the smaller
device but the packaging itself is very
very similar to that there's also some
design sense here that you can see from
the Nexus One now once again here's the
box we will put this box aside and we'll
get to the phone laughs we're actually
going to make you wait on that give it a
little bit of a cliffhanger and we'll
get into what's in the box first so so
if we have some manuals from HTC to
contact us manual some warranty all that
fun stuff that you get with every box
we're gonna have the adapters themselves
and these are going to be the UK type
power adapters because again this is a
unlocked phone so as you see here we
have the UK prongs now for charging it
does use the micro USB they're also
going to give you the sync cable for
that so you can actually plug this guy
into your computer sync it up this way
as well as charge it so there's your
micro USB cable right there and they're
also going to give you a set of
headphones in the box itself which look
to have a play/pause and possibly a
answer phone and hang up on the phone
call
as well as a microphone all right now
we're actually go ahead and get to the
meat of this unboxing here which is the
HTC Wildfire itself as you can see here
there's a smaller device a smaller form
factor we're gonna have a nice little
change of design on the back now we're
going to pop the battery out just to be
sure that it is in fact in there and
sitting correctly just we can turn this
on give you a startup for the first time
so then we did check is the batteries
and they almost like a little sled
plastic sled so it doesn't turn on while
it's shipping which is actually kind of
a little cool design that way the
battery is already in the device itself
now we will go into more detail on the
hardware itself in our hardware overview
video but for now we're just gonna go
ahead and turn it on just so you get the
nice HTC logo splash screen and right
off the bat it does feel very similar to
the Nexus One it looks very similar to
the Nexus One it's a little shorter
because it is a smaller device however
it definitely shares a lot of the same
design sense here alright and we are now
fully booted up and it wants us to
select our primary language and of
course we're gonna go ahead and select
English here and it's going to tell us
to remove the back cover and insert the
SIM card I'm gonna skip this step for
now just because we're naka put the sim
card in just yet I'm going to skip the
on-screen tutorial just so we can kind
of get into showing you the phone itself
right off the bat of course it is
equipped with Wi-Fi we will worry about
that later on and it's asking if we
would like to use all of Google's
settings the time and the date we're
going to skip for now as well because
the sim card once we connect to the AT&amp;amp;T
network it will automatically pull that
down and they do tell you to you know
connect with Facebook with Flickr right
off the bat so it really kind of gives
the basic users the people who don't
already know to go ahead and do that a
little bit of a tip to say hey you know
you can get this this much more out of
your device by doing this etc etc so now
we can get the helicopter view is it
just mentioned just by pinching in and
out
I should see right there which will give
us a total of seven screens and of
course we have the ability to swipe left
and right and is your typical HTC Sense
that's one of the nice things about
since a lot of people say that it
canceled on the phone and that sort of
thing because it is a skin it definitely
is one of the more intense skins out
there however the nice thing about it is
it's very consistent if you change from
any HTC
to another HTC device you're gonna have
cents on there so it's like picking up
the same phone it's in a different form
factor or footprint what we're gonna do
now is go ahead and get this guys set up
and we'll bring you some more videos
coming very soon stay tuned for our
software overview our hardware overview
and then our second software overview
followed by a final review once again
this has been the HTC Wildfire stay
tuned please give us a thumbs up thanks
