weekly hello and welcome to episode 03
one of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss the brutal and the
bodacious in the world of mobile
technology I'm your host Michael Fisher
and joining me this morning despite is
even crazier than normal schedule and a
Skype connection that just is determined
to be annoying he's managing editor and
Tandy naudia good morning sir hey
everybody and as well the man with the
newly modded iphone 5 editor in chief
Brandon minimun good morning to you
sorry that was that was the sound sound
board in front of me speaking on behalf
of me hello that's I was gonna say is
that your rendition of our new video
intro because it's awesome and oh yeah I
feel like I feel like that needs to be
like announcement number one of the day
because we have new video intro and
outro segments and they are rocking I
think they're a little overdue our old
ones were cool and some people are sad
to see him go with our awesome guitar
music which it's still on the podcast as
of now but I think we're gonna we are
gonna change that to the new one as soon
as we get lucky I still have the track I
can listen to it whenever I I need a
shot of good old memories Tony you could
you could like sell that track if it
wasn't you know if it was if we had
actually created it because it wait did
you do that custom mix was that your
work tell me which one I think the
podcast on the podcast is my work when
the after the buzz is the hymas work oh
that's awesome i love it um yeah hey
some news just fresh out the the old
wire which I'm AOL has purchased of
course AOL owns the web blocks network
which includes um joystick and engadget
and TechCrunch and mm-hmm tois they've
purchased gtgt very interesting whoa
really that's interesting SMS just like
us exactly actually that's our first
announcement series
it seems like I was walking to the
coffee shop for the second time today
because I've already been working for
three hours which is unusual for me as
i'm a night out today i can testify
today yeah you guys get like your of
blast of emails from me around like 10
am's like Michaels awake but the thing
is today I had to wake up early for
something I'll talk about in a second
but I was walking to the coffee shop
numbers realizing that I feel like I'm
in a I feel like we're in a trade show
mode right now I feel like we're
generating so much content that it feels
like I'm at CES or something like that
but we're not I mean we still have a
more than a way to go before to mwc it's
just that we heart we are delivering a
ton of stuff right now so if you have
not been to the packing.com home page
this is not just a commercial is legette
like it's the feed is moving so quickly
that you should probably go see it and
bond stuff yeah and Tony and Brennan you
guys are doing an excellent job of I
guess it's Tony's department of keeping
cool stuff up in the in the top what we
call those the church is a featured like
tiles up there yeah they're awesome but
anyway there's there's a lot going on
and it's our first week with both of our
new team members Taylor Martin and Adam
doubt am i pronouncing that right by the
way yes okay cool we had our
announcement video go up on Monday the
news finally went public I can finally
stop keeping these secrets and it's it's
awesome I just tweeted this morning
something like if you haven't read our
pieces by our new guys that's did so
awesome I mean I really really like
they're both of their tone they're there
they're writing style and I think
they're really awesome additions to the
team already in the first week isn't
even over yet so that's awesome news
wait for our thought thread before we
jump into the news run down because we
have a lot to cover as usual I want to
talk a little bit I don't know Brandon
do you want to talk about about your
iPhone first cuz I've been talking for a
minute and I want to talk for a minute
you want to break up the tonality here a
little bit i do cuz i'm already bored of
my boy wait what what chicka chicka what
what why yeah yeah so I am so I've been
using the iphone 5 on and off for the
last four or five months most
I've been using the optimus G a little
bit here the nexus for a little bit
there but the iPhone 5 has I've been
using it most of the time and yeah I
love the hardware and it's got a nice
you know design and everything it feels
good in the pocket but I hate the
software the software so boring it's
like so many times I've said damn it why
can't you do this or why can't you do
that and you know of course android
answers that question with of course I
can do that just route me and do
anything you friggin want to me but the
iphone iOS can't do that until you
jailbreak so finally the ios jailbreak
came out for iOS 6 and it's extremely
easy it literally takes 30 minutes you
plug it into your computer him but but a
boom by the bam which is funny because
if you think about the earlier days of
jailbreaking you had to put like command
line prompt sin and all this stuff and
it took a really long time so it's been
awesome of these those were the days but
do you guys do you guys remember
jailbreakme.com yahoo that was literally
the easiest possible thing you could
ever possibly do it one click you go to
a website you slide a slider and you
we're gonna leave it didn't last long Oh
wasn't that what at Apple take it down I
will shut it down pretty quickly
although it's funny because people
before the they they they patched that
people would go to apple stores go to
jailbreakme.com and jailbreak on every
iPhone on the on the table of the apple
store which is funny but anyway
jailbreaking this time is different
because the iPhone 5 has more ram it's
got more CPU power and Scott a bigger
battery so the stuff that would normally
slow you down an impact battery life
still does so but to a much much much
lesser effect and best of all I found
this app called accelerate and it's free
and what it does is it reduces the
system animations and it's funny because
Android can do this out of the box if
you go to developer options but in iOS
system animations take like a second or
two seconds to do everything opening
folders launching an app sliding through
settings but with accelerate you can
turn that off completely or do a various
various magnitudes of animation and it's
literally changed the way that I use the
iphone it feels like a different phone
it feels like I'm overclocked or
something and it works on the ipad to
what i would like to
no on this exact note and sorry for
interrupting is whether those animations
are there just for the I don't know user
experience or the kookiness of iOS or is
there something background happening
while that animation is happening like I
don't know caches buffers and stuff like
that and again yeah that's a good point
the animations do two things one is it
makes the device feel more fluid and and
iOS from day one back d level 7 was
always the fluid operating system and
then you know Windows Phone came out it
was like oh this is fluid and then
jellybean came out and then Andrew
became fluid so it doesn't really stand
out as a as a unique feature the second
thing that it does is it buys the phone
time which is important if you're
loading an app that's not in memory and
this is becoming less and less relevant
but back in the days when the iphone at
256 megs of ram when it first came out
you could only get like two or three
apps to be cached in memory everything
else would have to kind of reload itself
because the way that ram works in iOS is
that new apps will kick Oh taps out of
memory and any phone works that way so
it offers is so the the reason that it
works it's okay on the iphone 5s because
you get a gigabyte of ram so probably
the last five or six apps are in mint
are are in memory and are cached and so
they literally load instantly it's
unbelievable umm so so that's that's the
first thing that I did and then there's
some other stuff that i did--like i got
oxy Oh a ux 0 which is task manager done
the way that it should be done out of
the box so you double tap on the home
button and to close an app you swipe
down what kind of like and when you
double tap in the home button it's like
there there big old tiles aren't they
like is that what you're just like webos
cards yeah they're big old mintages it's
just like web us there are many previews
but even though they're so small you can
actually see like I'm looking at
Facebook in the last instant of it it's
a facebook i was looking at a weather
map and I see a mini tiny weather map
it's just it's brilliant I was about to
say if you can't read that with your
pixelvision that i'm gonna eat my hat I
you'd be able to read this tiny it's not
you know it's it's it's bigger it's
taller but um so awk co is just awesome
I mean it hasn't changed that much it
just makes things more pretty and then I
some things like Zephyrs eep HR which
allow you to do some interesting
gestures like I could swipe up from the
bottom to get multitask I can swipe side
to side to switch between apps ah let's
see that's a perfect that's exactly what
iOS needs yeah it's kind of like in a
Chrome for Android or Chrome for iOS
where you swipe swipe to go from tap tap
right or like or like some of the bigger
gestures like on the iPad in general or
some of the gestures on blackberry or
just just gestures is absolutely the way
to go so that's it's cool that there's a
actual amount available for that I wish
that these guys who are cooking these
things up would give them names that are
at least pronounce them whole or remain
memorable in a way that's not like oh
wow that sounds like a rock band from
2003 but not good yes and um no I mean I
haven't done that many things another
thing i've done is download this app
called now now which allows you to
relink the tap and hold instead of gets
instead of siri you now get the google
voice search which is a thousand million
million times more accurate and reliable
than Cirie man series sucks it it did
but it really does suck what her web
search or just in general just in
general and I mean fifty percent I like
it when it works but fifty percent of
time I'll say something I'll see it spin
spin spin and I'll time out really hmm
oh that never that's not the case on my
mother's iphone 5 or it didn't happen to
me either maybe seriously as I you Celia
naively reason oh yeah maybe maybe it's
been I a cadet case can I just I just
want to say that actually serious and
you call me whatever you want I think a
Syria is probably the feature that I
would use the most often if I had an iOS
as a daily driver which is something
Tony and I were talking about recently I
was like you know I'm getting to the
point where i would like to carry an
iphone for a little while as my as my
daily driver just to remember what it's
like and i think i would use Siri a
whole lot and I think it's a really good
experience for what it is and I think it
still blows everything else out of the
water so and for you guys in the states
at office offers even more than then for
me for instance where i cannot find for
i cannot search for restaurants or
you venues for that matter it's yeah and
and you know what their expanded
functionality like you can make a
restaurant reservation it's cool but
it's a little bit of a cop-out for
example I used it to make a restaurant
reservation the other day and I said
this is what I said I said reservation
for two restaurant name date right and
it very natural thing to do and it comes
up with the restaurant with a beautiful
restaurant card it says click here to
make a reservation I'm like this is
awesome so I click there and it says you
must have the open table mat open table
too happy up yeah yeah so so I download
the opentable fi I say the exact same
string i press the same button and it
opens the opentable app with information
pre filled out which i guess is cool but
it's kind of cheating isn't it well no I
mean what do you mean why because they
because it needs a third party app yeah
it should do it all within Syria and it
does the same thing with buying movie
tickets at opens often dango and it just
seems too easy like yo you can link
Syria with third-party apps right well I
think that's good though because I think
in the long run it'll expand its its
functionality you know and it'll take
some of the some of the development load
off of Apple which I'm sure you know
obviously they have as much as many
resources as they want but they have a
lot they're probably throwing a lot of
energy at just rebuilding iOS at this
point from a UI standpoint maybe do
Michael becoming an iOS advocate or
ahahaha defender oh you know and I was
about to shamelessly pimp out something
guys if aside from everything that
brandon mentioned there's an awesome
video by taylor martin 5 no let's see
it's five things you should immediately
do after jailbreaking so if you're new
to jailbreaking you should check that
one out yes absolutely right that was I
was gonna put that in the iOS 3 i'll
just throw it in the thug it'll just
read them bit yeah re re pimpin pimpin
we get there alright so it's a wrap to
wrap things up with the iowa sector
they're not the iowa section the yeah
yeah the thought right here on the
jailbreaking the iphone 5 um if you have
an iphone 5 or even a for us or for
jailbreaking is better than ever it's
still a little crusty around the edges
but it's much better and Michael when we
get to iOS I want to talk about Mitt L
box okay yeah right that app with a long
wait that many
are you excited about soul still don't
understand what that's what I'm looking
forward I don't either i'm looking
forward to a lesson on that on the on
the complete opposite side of the
spectrum as far as newly is as far as
operating systems go you know instead of
this established polished thing that is
iOS we have yolo's sailfish which is the
if you don't remember is what has become
of kind of the remnants of me go and
there many many of the people who were
at nokia or nakia if you prefer who then
left the company after the Windows Phone
transition and kind of decided to start
their own thing now I had an awesome
conversation this morning with Stefano
Moscone who is the CIO of yola and who
was nice enough to take some questions
from from me and I'll be writing a piece
on it later today it won't be up at the
time the podcast goes live but it'll be
up soon after so look for it and it was
really really awesome to hear to get to
ask these questions because you know I I
cooked up the usual round of pre pre
call questions with Brandon's help you
know it's like well what's about
sailfish and its technical stuff and
it's like the app question and who is
this for and all that but my favorite
question I got to ask is like what's it
like inside a company that a group of
people that was with nokia nokia said
we're doing this thing and this group of
people was like no we've been working on
this meeko thing forever and we really
liked it we think it has potential so
we're gonna go do this other thing and
we've talked about it on the podcast
before and it was it was interesting to
get some insight on that it was
interesting to hear about that it was
kind of less of a rebellion and more of
a well this group is going to be phased
out anyway internally so we might as
well go someplace else I just have a
question if the answer to this question
will be in your editorial then don't
answer but if it's the other way around
I would like to know what phones will be
running selfish or will it be a freely
downloadable something which Iran on any
of your phones or will they partner up
with an OEM or how will this thing
happen yes to all that
yeah so it looks like they're going to
go with a staggered kind of roll out and
this isn't you know I don't want to
there's no big secret i think you should
read the editorial anyway because
there's more stuff in here than that but
there's like i did ask that and they're
gonna do a version that runs on existing
hardware they are also going to release
their own hardware and then they're
going to license it to manufacturers any
idea any hints on the existing partner
that will be out around it no there was
no there was pointedly no talk about
that what is your feeling that we'll get
and get it on like the Galaxy Nexus and
so forth yeah I feel like the Galaxy
Nexus is the obvious choice there was
Stefano really couldn't couldn't talk
about anything specifically but the
Galaxy Nexus is kind of that thing that
people are using to run their
open-source platforms what wasn't um
what's it called running on it open not
I mean obviously open webOS but uh
mobile you want to yeah yeah yeah yeah
so it's gonna be interesting to see a
selfish we they will be at mwc so Tony
you and I should make an effort to stop
by the booth and we will try at least we
will try but it was it was very cool as
I posted on my facebook timeline today
any any day that starts with an 8am
phone call to Helsinki is a cool one
still is really nice to talk to those
guys and uh and yeah it'll be posted
soon so it's cool I like new platforms
we if they're always exciting and
whether they are official you know
closed source kind of big company new
platforms like blackberry 10 or whether
they're kind of grassroots small startup
projects it's very interesting and I got
some answers to some cultural questions
I wasn't expecting very surprising
responses so it was definitely a great
time and once again we thank sailfish
for their time on that and with that
let's jump into Android shall we because
we have been talking about iOS mods and
most of them were software but yesterday
I found myself consumed with a hardware
mod to the galaxy s3 which was a
suggestion from Brandon ah antoni I
don't know I don't you guys cook this
album Brandon cooked it up and I just
made sure it happens yes the end the
executor we ordered our supplies for
this last
can they came in and basically what
happened I spent I spent a good long
while yesterday like knuckle deep in
copper tape and sweating over an open
galaxy s3 just kind of like cursing in
my kitchen this came from a thread on
XDA developers that always happen yo I
mean you all yeah that's a common
Tuesday pillow um this came from a
thread round next xda-developers with
like the thread titles ridiculous it's
it came from a user called Android 9420
one or something like that it sits in
the post and it's a wonderful like run
down procedure for modifying the galaxy
s3 to accept the wireless charging
ability of the the palm touchstone and
the thing is the title is like super
easy five-minute hack for wireless right
in your dreams Thanks exactly and like
when Tony sent me this for the story oh
this will be a great video cool and I
kind of put it aside after I ordered all
the stuff like it's gonna take a week to
come in whatever i'll deal with that
five minutes see i got five minutes this
thing took me like three hours man and
it was a giant giant undertaking and i
don't i don't mean that I mean that with
the considering my expectations were
that it would take a few minutes it's
not a five-minute mod unless what if he
what if you do it once again if I were
to do it again it would take me half the
time but at the same time so once i was
finished i finished up this mod which
I'll talk about a little bit in a second
and I put it on the touch tone and it
didn't work and for about seriously for
about 45 minutes I was just
troubleshooting I'm like I'm tracing
these circuit pass and I don't have a
voltmeter so I can't tell where the
problem is so I'm just basically packing
more and more copper tape into every
connection there it is until I have
resistance yeah exactly and I'm adding
resistance every day I thought about
that adding like the fifth layer of
copper tape I'm like you know this is
this current isn't even gonna be enough
once it actually works but but um anyway
in the end I ended up with the ugliest
grossest looking hack which you can see
in the video but you know what it worked
I was so desperate I i will i will admit
to this I was so desperate I was I was
thinking of posting the video with the
failure and he's rocking that her phone
as we speak or did you dismantle it I
wanted to smell it because it's so ugly
the thing is it creates a bulge in the
galaxy s3's battery door because the
magnets the neodymium or whatever rare
earth magnets that I used to keep the
galaxy s3 on the touchdown are very
thick and what they do is they warp the
battery door so you can see in the video
it's got quite a bulge I'm going to take
it at the modification out because I
already have enough things that
wirelessly charge and I don't use the s3
as a daily driver so I don't really care
but it is a very cool thing if you if
you rock the galaxy s3 you don't want to
wait for the official charger or you
don't want to get the the Qi charger for
whatever reason if you just have like 10
touchdown sitting around from what you
used to have a pre it's a cool thing to
do can you could you use double-sided
tape gee I mean can you skip the magnets
you some kind of adherence device or
tilt it so it's flat oh yeah but I mean
then you then you could just use like a
regular Qi charging plate or whatever
you know the thing with the touchdown is
that it props up the device kind of
economically and it it looks good and
it's you can kind of use it a little
better the thing is you don't need to
use magnets you can use on the palm pixi
back which is required for this mod
there are four like ferrous metal discs
they're not magnums you just pop those
out you put them in place and the
attraction to the touchstone is not as
strong but it does work that is because
the touchstone already has some magnets
inside so it's magnets and magnets
versus magnets and metal exactly that's
exactly right so it was very cool I'm
actually part of it the best part of it
for me was actually being able to get
inside the pixi battery door and look at
the actual charging coil element which
is so cool I mean it's just the simplest
thing ever it's just a very tightly
wound copper wire you know over and over
again until it forms this little copper
donut and you just pop that thing right
out with a knife you stick it in the the
battery door you taping in I can see why
you would title a thread like this a
five minute mod but I definitely
definitely definitely wasn't wasn't a
five-minute mod be curious to know if
somebody would use this on the long term
would there be any I don't know
downsides bye
real life would it be affected and I'm
not saying juice maybe battery life as
in deteriorating your battery over time
overall endurance yeah I mean yeah I
don't think so you know because it's
it's probably not the I'm sorry that I
don't have the figures to answer that
question specifically but it's it's
probably not the current that the
battery is used to receiving I'm sure
it's lower and it charges tens of charge
a little more slowly I think but I don't
think that it would really damage the
battery the voltage should be the same
the amperage should defer Nia yeah
what's interesting about the touchstone
is that it it prefers a very strict
range of either voltage or amperage or
water or whatever so you you kind of
have to use the palm charging connector
with it some USB cables will work but
others won't it's a very interesting
kind of tight set of specs that that are
needed to make wireless charging the
induction that palm uses work and it
doesn't adhere to any standard because
in 2009 when it came out I don't think
she was even around don't have to look
that up we will have to look that up
that might be the king of wireless
charging mm-hmm yes yes oh oh mi suppose
ya well the nexus for wireless charging
orb is finally for sale oh yeah we are
going to student has one and we when we
has we will show it off it's a little
bit more expensive for word on the
street is that you can get one for
probably twenty dollars less on amazon
well you can get that one for much less
if you you know just search for Queen
wireless charger only got almost at a
party for out what you know the official
nexus for wireless charging orb is a
little more attractive than your average
you know third-party charging that loss
enthusiast if the brand will always
prefer something which is the official
thing that's right um it looks like it
looks like a nexus q does yeah it looks
like a cue that's been like sawed in
half the thing oh it's cool no like yeah
that's half the size yeah but I want it
I want it so bad i think i tweeted this
here that i like the charging or makes
me want the nexus for so much more i
could only put up with a lack of LTE for
i'm such a wireless charging nerd
and I'm gonna get this for just because
it has wireless chargers one of the
truck and you know what like here's the
thing i have devices that charge
wireless i have plenty of them i have
the Lumia 920 I've got a DNA sitting
right next to me blah blah blah blah
blah but they all lack this kind of
understanding of ergonomics the Lumia
920 goes on top of the JBL powerup jock
and it lays down horizontally so it's
like I have to like turn my head one way
or the other to see the screen properly
when I'm standing in front of the
powerup jock on the Nokia wireless
charging plate you drop the Lumia 920 on
top of it and it's like okay but there's
nothing holding it in place so you have
to like position it yourself like palm
did wireless charging right the first
time and it it stayed right when Matias
Duarte basically took it to to Google
you know because the nexus 4 orb has
magnets and it holds the phone in place
at an angle so you can see what's it
doing and it's beautiful looking so I
that's that's why I think I think it's
obviously we don't have it in house yet
so maybe brandon you'll review the thing
and it'll be like this is crap and
here's why and I'll be like all right
I'm totally wrong but it looks awesome
so I don't relating to the Nexus devices
we all know that there is a nexus 7 that
has ATT hspa+ right sure since i since
when is there also a t-mobile version is
that is that new or is it been there for
well in the google play store no man I
don't know I bet fell asleep when you
said t-mobile hunter now I'm gonna
answer that if I would have access to
the google play store in the US but i
don't know okay well i think this might
be new i haven't seen this before hello
t-mobile nexus 7 interesting yeah let us
move on let's talk about something that
is yeah yeah i am also bored what can we
talk about the galaxy s4 real quick yeah
cuz rumors look to additional project j
quote-unquote devices say say rumors
from Sam mobile it looks like what is
cool about this is that there's a device
codenamed Serrano which is possibly a
project J mini which would be hopefully
like the galaxy s3 mini except not
utter junk right hmm um there could also
be there's something called a project J
active codenamed Fortius or four sh asst
photos really what's it what is that a
reference to I didn't look that up it's
from Latin it's stronger yes which might
be some kind of small media player maybe
something like the pebble again maybe
not like crap and not the pebble
smartwatch the the Samsung Galaxy pebble
thing anyway there's a ton of rumors
suggesting that this galaxy s4 is going
to have a little product family
surrounding it and the most exciting
thing for me and you guys jump in
anytime I think that the galaxy s4 mini
would be amazing if it depends if they
screwed up like the s3 mini not a melty
fact if they if they do that then
that'll suck a lot but so I I've been
thinking about this this project JN we
we've been hearing about project J since
months now since I think it was q3 or q4
last year and the thing is we don't know
anything about project J so I'm not sure
whether I should be excited or not about
the project J but I think I solved the
entire mystery and this is an exclusive
guys only for you samsung will be
ditching the galaxy brand and they gonna
they're gonna roll with the samsung
galaxy brand galaxy galaxy yes I think
that would be awesome they're gonna come
so that that there you have it project j
you heard it here fire first project j
project galaxy from samson um it's
however it comes out whatever it's named
and whatever actually happens with this
i think i think it's gonna be cool i'm
holding out hope Tony I agree with you
that the gs4 will be a true mini it'll
be the flagship specs and experience
just in a smaller package which is
something we've been petitioning yes
dominate agents yeah hopefully ya want
it people buy it so they should make it
exactly that's gonna be one of the 38
phones to be released this year by
Samsung yeah all galaxies by the way or
jealousies depends or jealousy yeah
whatever your whatever floats your boat
it's not the only South Korean
manufacturer who is
announcing or not announcing but who was
the rumor mill is treating with alacrity
that's a stupid sentence but I'm going
to stick with it then the thing is at LG
is Taylor Martin wrote an awesome piece
about why the optimus g pro from LG this
rumored or maybe confirmed device will
not be a Galaxy Note killer it's an
awesome piece we've we've talked enough
about why how Taylor's pieces are
awesome but this is really almost every
point it makes but importantly because
it has been such a busy time I didn't
know I'd where I forgot that the optimus
g pro was gonna be this massive device
what is it got its like a 5.5 at five
point five point five point five inches
but not just before we run into this I
would like to ask you guys both
something yeah what does it make a
Galaxy Note a galaxy note is it the
large screen or is it the stylus it's it
is both and neither in my opinion it is
it is the large screen paired with these
stylus and crucially the software that
has the ability to take advantage of the
larger screen real estate so in this
case it's a logical thing to say that
any phone regardless of screen dimension
which doesn't have a stylist will not be
an ocular and and the software to said
you know the window yeah so forth but I
feel like you're driving at the at the
stylus point right Tony are you good
shopping a point but yeah more or less
yes because you obviously love the
stylus I don't want to use it or at
least use it but on my future galaxy
note 2 I will take out the stylus and
leave it at home because I don't find it
useful anymore oh you will find yourself
with a with a ring finger that is
annoyed because of that empty silo that
always hangs and i will just saw it off
and stick it in there the stylist the
stylist then ok everyone unpacking alive
every everyone we come across that has a
galaxy note 2 or like oh that's that's
cool do you uh do you use the stylist
there like of course oh actually no i
really don't ever use it and I like
having it yeah here's the thing if you
use a note too long enough you start
pulling for the stylus on other devices
and that's when you realize
how often you use it because I'll be on
this DNA and i'll be on the train and
i'll be like okay and it's not because
I'm gaining additional functionality
from the s-pen usually usually what I'm
using it for is to pull it out and to
scroll with it because it is more
comfortable for me now to keep my hand
hmm yeah it's it's it's more comfortable
for me to keep my hand further from the
screen and just use the stylus to it's
difficult to describe but it is
physically a very comfortable immersive
and more fun experience I think it's
it's very natural for your hand to sort
of like a pencil wrap around it and kind
of grasp it with your fingertips versus
sort of using your arm and your forearm
to scroll yes is more tiring yes but
using a stylus makes you use the device
with two hands I mean you got used this
yeah and the I don't know maybe it's
about me personally but for me the note
2 is just a large galaxy s3 and that's
all wait until you get one and do some
multitasking and I think you'll your
mind will change a little bit okay we'll
talk about this next week yeah yeah I
always cite the example of driving with
Brandon at CES and like having google
navigation in one pain while i looked at
twitter in the other and you know both
of us were happy because the phone was
doing two things at once I usually drive
ride alone I run though anyway Tony you
make a very good point though like this
optimus g pro whatever it is will need
to bring a lot of heat to compete with
the note 22 we let alone be a note to
killer and i think any that's true for
any phablet contender so we will see and
maybe we'll see it at mwc yeah we will
surely see it in the mwc good other
things from other manufacturers HTC the
m7 is so jealous of you guys why because
if we're going to the event yeah and
because HTC decided to do it a different
way this year I don't know why I was so
used to meeting new HTC phones at the
show floor at mwc and now is gonna be
huh there's the m7 from yesterday right
from last week from nobody's gonna care
yeah well no I mean you will pay well go
ahead room HTC HTC needs the m7 to be
yellow well let me take that back at
last year the 1-series was so important
to them The One X this is the phone to
fix the company and it didn't and this
year it's like that but even more
because it's like HTC cried wolf last
year they said this is the year where
you know we're gonna focus on the 1
series and we're gonna sell tons of them
it's gonna be the best phone ever and
then it didn't happen and so this year's
a little bit more what's the word high
stakes for HTC and that's awesome
because this the leaks were hearing
about the the m7 with the ultrapixel
camera and the the form factor and we've
seen leaks of very strange-looking
devices that seem to be prototype images
I think that's gonna be awesome yeah
okay I I think this is gonna be awesome
too and i agree Brennan I think you make
some great points that this is once
again make-or-break time for HTC even
more so than it was with the one because
it could have been the one could have
been there they're saving grace if it
hadn't been for a variety of factors
that we've talked about about 15 million
times so it I get very excited when I
see not only that they are going to
release a new hot device which I haven't
seen this render before today by the way
this thing that looks like an iphone 5
except it's not um so that that looks
really really cool it brings back it
harkens back to that first leak we saw
of the m7 where I was like oh exciting
drilled holes in the top and bottom I
like this design language but here we
have some sort of chamfered edge it
looks like but more so than that it
looks like they are going to bring the
one brand they're gonna continue with
the one brand and maybe this is just
yeah you know I think the one brand
failed last year because they had the X
the S the V and it's like it really
wasn't one it was like you meant you
couldn't might as well have called it
three because there were three
particular don't forget about a one x+
though that's for exactly the one expert
yeah and the one XL and so yeah you know
if this is like if this is the one if
this is htcs stab at doing what Samsung
did with the galaxy s3
it's like identical physical dimensions
the phone looks the same across every
carrier then that will be huge for them
that NDFs ence is actually the
modernization that we hope it is because
the current sense is just disastrous you
know one gets my antenna extended nope
so so the m7 is like the DNA but better
in every way that the DNA could be
better like number one it's a little bit
the DNA is a little bit too big the m7
is gonna be smaller smaller screen 4.7
inches versus five inches too it's going
to have the s4 pro but a faster s4 pro
so once in a while the DNA gets a little
laggy the m7 should have more power
under the hood number three the camera
on the DNA is met camera on the m7
presumably will be better and number
four since five point oh looks frickin
awesome and the sense what is that the
DNA have sense four point four plus or
something like that sense 4 plus which
is okay but it still smells of sense 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 which is that hey these Boca
elements these elements are a little too
shiny this is a little bit too graphic
intense let me just you know live with
my content and frolic with it for a
little bit so so and and and then and
then the m7 will have that that amazing
screen right and it will be thin
presumably endless before you get too
far away from sense let me you took the
words right out of my mouth my time with
the droid DNA this week has reminded me
or maybe shown me for the first time
just how antic ated some elements of
sense are even in their new formulation
and since running on the droid DNA
Brandon knows this Tony I'm not sure if
you remember since running on the DNA is
amazing because it is very responsive
it's more responsive than any version of
sense i've ever tried probably because
the hardware is so good yes for pro
right yeah right it's running on the s4
pro so as a result responsiveness is
nice but then you focus more on how
sense looks and every time i try and
share like a photo from the DNA and i
get though that row of buttons along the
bottom of the screen that's like there's
no icons it's just like lowercase tall
arial font letters there
share more I'm like what is this like
it's even I'm not saying I I am saying i
prefer TouchWiz but I'm I I think
TouchWiz is ugly in its own way but it's
nowhere near as weird as the news and so
I don't know I'm here even liked it it
is very metro esque easy yeah it is but
it's like Metro like done terribly all
right row mixed with with his metro
mixed with anti metro yeah it looks like
a given me if metro and webos like webos
one like got together and we're like
they had a really rough night together
like it's what they look like the next
morning you know what's so interesting
this this this movement towards
flattening of you eyes like you go back
to the iphone the first iphone
everything was shiny and classy and
textured and reflective and then then we
got to like Windows 8 Windows Phone
flattened everything android flattened
things and it's it's an and I gotta
wonder where we go from here because you
eyes can be 3d ish glossy or they can be
flat can they be in anything else yeah
you will look what happened ramik never
had three date well look what he did in
in in the desktop you know we get das
and then we went to Windows three dot
one with this you know the scheme or
fect things started coming in and then
windows 95 came up and we had more 3d
elements like the start button was 3d
and all this kind of stuff but then what
happened is instead of going hyperreal
with the next iteration with windows XP
microsoft did something weird and they
brought these carnival colors and where
it's like this deep blue and the bright
green and the yeah the red X orange yeah
yeah and I actually loved that I
remember having my dumb laptop in my
first year of college and just
underpowered of lube windows 98 or
something and watching everybody with
their new fresh installs of windows XP
and being like that is a i catching you
I that looks awesome I want to use that
so I you know and then now of course 7
and 8 is totally different so I think I
guess the lesson is there's always
somewhere new to go with UI design it's
just a question of having the the
cojones to you know actually do
something different you know would be
interesting and I doubt we'll ever see
this
something that hasn't changed in the
last you know 10 15 years is color
there's just so much color bright color
on every button encircle an icon it
would be interesting to see an a
movement towards monochrome mmm or just
you know black and gray mm white that
would be interesting everybody likes kid
or theme yeah I'm sure you just askin oh
there's probably some cool skins out
there all right who is somebody was
running an old like Mac Mac OS
like-for-like skin on their on their
smart device it was it was weird I'd
like to run like I'd like to run a
windows three dot one skin on one of my
accounts um while we're talking about
phones oh let's let's wrap up Android
here because we do have to move on and I
love Stevens headline is usually love
all Steven Simon's shouldn't $10,000 by
a better smartphone than the vertu ti Oh
Michael I forgot to tell you when after
you guys left CES i went to i forget i
think aria casino or something and they
had a ver tus store no way i was
freaking out cuz my wife was with pam
like it's a it's taster boxer like 50
think you understand understand what
this is and she was like shut up now
let's go and is why would I said I said
just let me let me go in for two minutes
so I go in and no one's in the store
there's a guy sitting behind almost leap
he almost asleep and I'm thinking like
who is going to buy these phones I'm
like search and do any of these phones
run and you know a modern smartphone OS
like Android he said yeah we've got one
coming it's not out yet and and so I'm
thinking to myself what so so these
phones that are 20,000 50,000 whatever
today can you get like a twitter app can
you like browse the web or are they just
like for extremely rich people that
don't even care about Twitter and
Facebook um I didn't really get too many
answers because I had to leave soon said
we have pulled out of the store then I'm
surprised there wasn't a concierge there
is it you know with like a a a silver
tray with some mints and sixers you have
questions about the smart phones I like
who buys this stuff come I don't know
man
that's always been the question with
virtue right and a nokia let the brand
go then they sell it off or something
yeah they did yeah so like well good for
them I mean I feel like that was it was
a way smarter move then like selling
their headquarters building Oh selling
two of these phones a year it's just
like selling two hundred thousand
mid-range engines I I would like to know
who buys these um who buy let me tell
you who buys these the one who has a
Bugatti Veyron in his garage the one who
walks on the red carpet with bling
blings on his or her phone so yeah
that's the one who buys the virtue phone
okay so that person buys this phone and
it significantly slower them like a
galaxy s3 don't care because they got a
phone and from that phone you can buy
your car but you got it I mean that's
true too but and the hardware is is
beautiful of course and whatever you got
these screws on the side and but then
they got left it's thick as a Bible yeah
i mean its massive but okay but I get
that it's beautiful and it looks like
maybe it came off an airplane from the
1940s and some kind of early you know
the idea of what's futuristic but the
minute the software comes on it's like
running whatever it's running Android is
probably ice cream sandwich or something
writer it is ice cream sandwich with a
wvga screen right and I'm sure it runs
like it doesn't run like butter you know
I'm sure it runs kind of pretty good you
guys are missing the point that the
customer for this film doesn't care
about Android jelly bean or ice cream
sandwich or black eNOS or the lack of
flag I'll be that kind of that kind of
customer takes this phone out at night
with their friends to impress them and
then goes home and turns on his galaxy
s3 probably more likely iphone 5 it's
like when you take off your Ferrari and
you leave you're right and I was
suburban at home just to show it off
that's her and I guess yeah I see that I
understand I used to carry when I had a
sidekick back in the day I used to swap
my sim into a motorola krzr when I
wanted to be fancy out on the hey razor
heavener that well what did that phone
have you're gonna make me google for but
I want to make cookie sounds like
keyboard what do you mean what uh
wouldwould it at home can you was the
crazy the crazy was the the razor that
they thinned down into like a much much
narrower foreign power wrong and they
covered it in glass it was the first
class phone I ever run was that a status
symbol it was it was it could because I
got it before it was released in the
states so I'm this like right blue glass
flip phone that looked like a racer
except it was smaller and people were
like what is that that's awesome I'm SMS
flip phone so hard um let's let's jump
into Windows Phone shall we okay and let
me before you start to run down ask you
one question I was holding on to this
question we were talking about HTC and
the one and possible phones and wc dude
thank you guys think it is time for HTC
to come out at this Barcelona show with
the new windows phone ah mr. that they
should come out with the tablet no I
wouldn't want to sit what like a windows
tablet running or a android jelly that
android tablet cuz cuz cuz you know that
it's been since what the flyer in the
gesture I mean it's been like a full
year they've got to be working on
something to even yeah I don't know I I
would not be interested in I mean I
would be interested in an HTC tablet but
I would not be as interested in that
than a windows phone I think they found
something really interesting with with
their Windows Phone efforts and it
wasn't just stealing the brightly
colored idea from Nokia like it was it
was a thing where they were like oh we
have really slim hardware here and we
have it feels good in the hand and we've
put beats into it we've actually brought
some differentiators with Windows Phone
we've got that front facing camera so
Tony I don't think that will see it
because I think it's too early I think
they expected the windows phone 8x and
it has to be a bigger hit than they were
but I would love it if they exactly for
these points I think there will be or at
least if I was HTC I would have a new
windows phone at mwc because the windows
phone 8x was launched just like the
Lumia 920 and in that exact same period
and Lumia lose the Lumia line is
expected to have a new
at the show so that blow us the fact
that Nokia is kicking some serious htcs
and windows phone 8 department so HTC
really needs to move that bond on the
table so I if I was HTC I would have a
kick-ass windows phone 8 at this mdc-t I
think if they show anything though it'll
be it'll be pretty undercooked you know
because I don't think that they're ready
to show something oh yeah but again the
Lumia 920 was launched at the same time
as the 8 x and y SE na kiya is hopefully
ready with a new windows phone HTC
should be ready because they will lose
this game yeah I agree that they totally
totally should be ready would be a nice
one-two punch if if like a couple days
before him to MVC they came out with the
m7 and they're like hey check out this
thing and then a couple days later at
mwc they're like oh hey yeah we also did
this awesome thing for windows phone too
yeah I am yeah that would be cool but
the who knows what they're gonna do if
they do something awesome I will be very
excited and if we get to see this Lumia
this nokia lumia eos apparently there
was a video that was leaked and then
taken down by nokia russia regarding
this device it's been taken down it did
you guys see it no I haven't seen it but
judging from the screenshot which is on
our post and most probably on all the
other posts around the internet it's a
shot of the camera from the 808 PureView
yeah so I'm guessing that there might be
either a language barrier here and that
video might have had something to do
with the fact that the PureView 808 will
have its first anniversary so I don't
know maybe yeah maybe that was like the
delete in from the video where it's like
here's the PureView which where we did
something awesome and then you did go on
to talk about how they're gonna do
something even more awesome I'm Lucas
I'm excited as usual it was really cool
to see this headline pop up where I was
like a preview video with Louie and peer
review and we just have to wait on this
right now well yeah we do need a sound
board in here um let's move on from that
and speaking of tablets and speaking of
Nokia apparently nokia where this is
from another country this is nokia
stan has just had a launch event where
it fix your dad featured a photo of what
could be a Windows 8 tablet we've been
talking about forever but then again it
might not be that at all Steven kind of
this is from what this is from Nokia
gadgets yeah I'm we don't know i'm so
tired of nokia tablet rumors and
speculations yeah i'm gonna try to keep
this with the clean tag but i will make
an analogy it's like that super hot
woman or man because we're not success
that everybody wants to see naked and I
don't know you name it what kind of
magazine and they just come out on
record and say you'll never see me
because I don't want you I mean
everybody wants an ocular tablet I'm
nakia Stevie loves like I don't know
maybe we will maybe not yeah Steven ela
I feel like well that's a good analogy
first of all Tony and and second wife
Lee I feel like Stephen Elop is is the
new king of saying like yeah maybe like
to everything and people like are you
sir you know will you develop a will you
develop a tablet based on da six point
two point two maybe options are on the
table well I think at this point because
I just ready headline this morning that
Nokia is it was selling even more real
estate so at this point nokia would make
anything running everything if it
bounced him somewhere up nokia to
transition to commercial fishing all
options are on the table um we'll see
about what happens with that that's the
kind of light on Windows Windows found
news but it will take this opportunity
to say that we had a Lumia 920
durability report that I cooked up on
the heels of Brandon's iphone 5
durability report videos on our channel
so go check those out because those are
cool they're not full they're like what
are they they're like companions to the
two after the buds they're like very
specific snippets it's it's like a
feature focus from the ambos yeah it's
cool i like it it was a good idea good
idea let's talk briefly about iOS and i
know Brendan you've got something else
to talk about in here from iOS the Apple
there's a cool apple patent that I like
I hate whenever I see a story with a
patent headline that's like shows a
capture from out from a patent illustre
and I'm like tuning out this sucks but
this is really cool there's a an apple
patent for an image quiz lock screen
which apparently displays a photo of
like one of your friends and then
they're like 10 sliders underneath with
various choices for names and you have
to slide across the correct one to
unlock your phone so if you see it's for
you I there there are two problems with
this first of all it's not new at all I
mean whenever your facebook account is
hijacked you can recover it and you're
the system will show you images of your
friends and you have tried after oh
that's how that is 12 if I don't want my
wife which I don't have to unlock my
phone then I would set a password but
chances are that my wife and I have
friends in common so she might recognize
some of my friends and I don't know how
what the ratio of hit or miss would be
five out of ten 10 out of 10 I don't
know but chances are she might unlock my
phone and if I don't want that phone to
be unlocked I just simply put a strong
password on it yeah that's that's true i
think my excitement mainly derives from
the fact that apple has not come out
with a new lock screen kind of idea
maybe since the launch of the iphone am
I wrong on that me yes you're correct
yes you're not wrong but I don't think
Apple needs a new lock screen i mean the
the lock screen which is the slide to
unlock was a huge hit do you guys
remember in the windows mobile day that
there was an s2 you to application every
windows mobile guy i knew was running as
to you to slide to unlock it's a good
thing that's not 2007 anymore though you
know but i can't think of anything else
I mean that that's not the problem of
iOS I think it is I well for me it's one
of its one of the things every time I
power on an iOS device and I see that
lock screen with a slide to unlock I'm
like wow that really impressed me six
years ago like in its what's the new
your perfect iOS on looks green it
wouldn't know something Yeah right if
it's real innovation would be with them
finding a way to ditch the lock screen
for something better like not like
mobile you bunt to exactly but something
similar but tell me more more
conventionally speaking a lock screen
for me is most
useful when I can use it not just to
unlock the phone but to unlock the phone
while jumping directly into a feature
you can do that you can just slide on
the notification it will jump you right
into your Twitter and your facebook your
email application your SMS application
or your phone application if you have a
notification waiting like what if i just
wanted to my car I really want to tweet
right now I can't do that I can't jump
right into Twitter from the lock screen
or I can't you know I know I can jump
into the camera and I can jump into
Facebook if I've received a notification
but you know on an HTC device I can drag
whatever the calendar into the circle to
pop right into the calendar I see your
point you know what I mean a touch with
an advising and tap and hold inside up
on anything yeah so that I I like
utility and I think apple is a company
that is definitely capable of delivering
utility while maintaining aesthetic
beauty and I would just like to see more
innovation from them on this lock screen
business but that's why I got excited I
was like oh cool that would be something
cool but then Tony's like yeah but let
me tell you why Wyatt all the reasons
that it sucks and like actually Tony you
make a good point so let's move on and
talk about jailbreaking we're gonna
we're actually gonna wrap up iOS on
jailbreaking and Brendan you can jump in
with your thing but this was surprising
to me that the numbers are suggesting
that jailbreaking might be more popular
than ever which is really surprising to
me nuts to me well yeah I will I will
ask why you are not why you are not
spread it's right because there are
millions of iphones morden and then with
the last year break okay so yes yes yes
raw numbers wise yes so what is this
evasion with a zero of course cuz it's
heck sores time has been installed on
five point 15 million iPhones apparently
and 1.35 million iPads I mean that's
these are incredible numbers to me and I
guess Tony you're right with such a
large volume of iOS devices out there
these numbers shouldn't be surprising
right so I mean just think of it for a
second if let's just say a number if two
percent of iphone / ipad users jailbroke
their devices two years ago that same
two percent is relative to a larger
number this year so it seems that that
two percentage of jailbreak users grows
with the user base but I
I would think that as I OS includes more
features natively more and more features
that the need for jailbreaking would
would decline so I might expect the
number of jailbreakers to remain flat
while the overall population of iphone
users increases but obviously that's not
the case I'd as Brandon as you guys both
discussed earlier in the podcast there
are a lot of sweet reasons for
jailbreaking by even an iOS 6 device
once again watch taylor martin's video
for that oh and was supposed to pimp
that ah double been to double plug um
tell us I forgot what you were gonna
talk about in this in this red bremen
that's gonna gonna talk about dumb
mailbox oh right tell me what that is
that's on the run down and i don't know
what it is yeah let me tell you what it
is and let me tell you how i'm using it
to make my life potentially more
productive so mailbox is an app and it's
for iOS right now but it's coming out
for android it's gonna come out for
desktop and web is gonna come out for
tablet android and tablet iOS and right
now if you download the app on your
iPhone your iPad you'll see a big weight
about 700,000 people in front of you as
with right now and the reason that
they're such a line is because there's
some server stuff that happens they have
to mail box has to process every message
they strip out some of the the more
heavy UI elements to make it more
readable and then they have this whole
engine that will allow you to defer a
message to later and I'll explain what
that means in a second so the app itself
is very lightweight it's very fast it's
very pretty I think it's nicer looking i
think it's faster than the built-in iOS
mail app it's definitely in my opinion
faster than the gmail app and here's the
magic you wake up in the morning feeling
like p diddy got my glasses on the floor
about the case just doesn't to say that
go ahead sorry you wake up in the you
wake up in the morning and you've got a
lot of emails in your inbox from all
different kinds of people you probably
multiple email accounts and the truth is
that most people use their inbox as a
task list stuff you gotta get done and
some people are really good about it
they hit what's called inbox zero daily
which means all of their messages are
archived and they have no messages in
their inbox some people keep all of
their messages and their inbox anyway so
let me give you an example I'm looking
at my inbox and I've got this email
chain going on about getting Michael a
new camera and I know I need to look
into that so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna sort I'm gonna swipe to the left
and ask mailbox to remind me of it later
today so what that means is that's going
to disappear from my inbox right now so
I don't see it but literally in three
hours from now it will re-enter my inbox
oh that's good let me give you another
example I've got an email from Tony
about the pocket now mobile site
redesign and I don't really need to
action on it now because it's too early
but maybe sometime next week I should
take a look at it so I'm going to swipe
that to the right and I'm gonna tell
mailbox to remind me next week mailbox
also has other ways of bringing it back
into your inbox there's a button that
says some day which is set for three or
two or one month from now if it's like a
you know something you should get done
but it's really not that important you
can set it for this weekend if it's
something that doesn't need to be done
during the week work week and all of
these different time periods so that
what you have is this inbox that is
constantly up to date with what you need
to do exactly so so the idea is that you
use it as arbitrage so that you kind of
determine your task list and then
everything happens automatically based
on what you determined when you need to
action on something so and question I'm
sorry designs this confined your device
though like or is there like a cloud
access ability that you can kind of see
it from another device or is it just
just on your one installed you know
that's a really good question so that
email that I just the email about
getting you a camera will pop back into
my gmail inbox on my desktop it will pop
in as a starred message in three hours
from now um the downside the downside is
though I can't do that from desktop so I
can't take that same message and say you
know I don't want to see this again for
another three hours I can only do that
part from the phone right now mm-hmm
so let me see if I got this straight
this thing you're talking about this
basically a flag for follow up with an
additional feature that removes it from
your phone's inbox because i use flag
for follow up all the time i receive an
email from you guys i don't need to
action on it right now flag for follow
up monday 5pm and I just shove it in my
inbox archive subfolder that I can
manage from my computer from my tablet
from my phone what you are saying is a
flag for follow up with a cleaner inbox
but only on your phone yes but it felt
like I said is it translates if you're
using gmail com and translating over
there and everything stored in the cloud
so presumably if you had an ipad app or
an android tablet app and you had
flagged for its it's kind of like flag
for follow-up i guess a flag for
follow-up on on your your mac it will
send you like a notification or
something that says you like this yeah
okay ever my tits so it's the same kind
of thing except your inbox is the
centralized area pops back into your
inbox it's like killing a message and
then it come back to life mmm yes it's
hard to explain like I like that though
I mean yeah see I didn't know that fight
for follow-up existed so I think for a
lot of people like me the mailboxes
seems even more revolutionary than it is
I think the fact that I kind of clumsily
explained it it helps to the it show
show that I why don't you show it off in
a video brandon i know i'm going to bed
good i done that and i still don't
completely understand it myself is what
i'm trying to say but I see its
potential I think but so i think was on
it said yeah it's got a lot of buzz so I
think actions are louder than words and
i'll make a video about it when I truly
understand what the heck is good at it
so far it's awesome so far it's very
intriguing i'll say that you can just
just don't be as just talk a little more
slowly than i did in spotify for windows
8 because i was so excited that i was
unintelligible everybody's michael
fisher was knocking on door come we got
a new the app that were waiting for
forever and here it is
let's close up our platform talk with
blackberry which we have a category for
now and I'm so excited about yes it's
not published right now on the site but
it should be published by the time the
podcast so it goes alive or within an
hour of the podcast going live somebody
stop me if I'm wrong on that the
blackberry z10 review from pocket now is
finally done it's ready can you has
provide preview sure yet the thing is
that i love getting reviews out early
it's always nice when you can have the
review out while the announcement is
still going on that's cool um but that
kind of that cannot always happen if you
know for whatever for one reason or
another but the thing is this I'm very
glad that we weren't one of those
companies one of the publications that
were that released on announcement day
and not because there's anything wrong
with their reviews but because having
the extra two weeks or whatever we had
allowed us to really get to know the
device I had a device that was probably
a lemon for a review unit so I had
enough time for blackberry to very
conscientiously and quickly respond and
get me a new unit so I was awesome of
them I was able to get to some in-depth
impressions and I was able to kind of
scour the comments of every blackberry
discussion on the internet for people
who wanted to know more and I was able
to answer some questions from our own
commenters and stuff so it 10 it is very
long review it's about the size of the
galaxy note 2 review which is around
4,000 words with a couple of embedded
videos but I think it's worth it we
don't have a separate review out for
blackberry 10 the blackberry 10 reviews
bundled into the z10 review so if you
want to know anything about the
blackberry z10 and you want to get your
info from pocket now you should read it
you should yes which you should you
should read it and in comment on it and
let me know if you want any other
questions answered and brandon is about
to get his own blackberry experience
very soon so he'll have videos and
impressions up and we'll all be able to
answer the questions about the new
blackberry soon but it is just really
cool to say that our first review of a
brand new platform is coming is coming
today so I just wanted to say that that
is awesome and do you guys have any
questions before we on the black barrier
I'll personally meet it in Barcelona
you'll be glad you'll be you'll be kind
enough to bring it to me there yes I
will I do have a question um it and and
I think this has been answered in
various forms so this is a different way
of asking it um so I you know I I can't
wait to try out that be the z10 and use
it in my daily life and what makes the
z10 of blackberry because the operating
system is almost unrecognizable from
previous versions what is it about it
that makes it blackberry besides the
flashing red notification LED it is it's
the hub it's the messaging functionality
which is not perfect there are there are
bugs there are things that need to be
tightened up but you go into that
blackberry hub where all your messages
are aggregated and it is it can be
nothing but a blackberry from the
iconography to the to the way text is
bolded little details like that to
broader means of how the messages are
handled and how they're displayed I mean
it's you look at it and your mind just
says blackberry except it doesn't say it
in the bad way of like wow this looks
like 2007 and looks like i have a pearl
like know what if did what if what what
if android key lime pie the next version
of android had this and you know it's
typical unified inbox but it added
option to add tweets and facebook
comments and all of that other stuff so
you have this like mega inbox with that
then i smell this lawsuit well you would
reach it would reach parody then maybe
with blackberry hub but i think nobody
cooked me if i'm wrong Michael but yeah
I think you have not used the typical
blackberry services like BB SBS bbm is
that correct baby I haven't had any
contacts to test vvm with so those also
add up to the blackberry experience if
if you work in a company or you have
your phone and you want super secure
email you just subscribe to a blackberry
service and right there you go boom
plus if all your buddies are on library
you can BBM and forget about facebook
Messenger and stuff like that yeah if
you're a corporate user absolutely or if
you're a user in a country where
blackberry is huge like India and all
your friends are on BBM and you've and
you've become accustomed to the
blackberry experience yeah this will
seem familiar in that awesome way that's
something that it was very old and
decrepit has now achieved a refresh
without forgetting what it is so you
know yeah absolutely I think there's a
different ways to answer the question
but for an American consumer who
basically forgot about blackberry like
like guy was I think the real core of
the experience is the hub and that's
that's the thing that blackberry offers
that's very different and in Brandon
just to finish that point about the
unified inbox of Android were to do it
android would have to build in the peak
functionality as well because it sounds
absurd to say but it is so very
different to peek at your inbox by
sliding a thumb up from the bottom bezel
than it is to slide a finger down from
the top it's just accelerating so
incredibly different yeah and by yeah I
can't wait to see that and I think um I
think those listening to this podcast
would get a lot out of the stuff we do
if you were to read Michaels review
because it gives you a lot of background
about blackberry 10 and about the z10
and it makes you well informed so that
when you know when we're talking about
the blackberry 10 in the future on
podcast boggin a lot of all of our shows
you kind of get it cuz this is gonna be
talked about well into the future hey
beautifully absolutely I can't wait to
review that q10 that's the last thing
I'll so I that's my next phone Oh
totally Harry that sucker that's gonna
be awesome um let's jump into listener
mail chance because we cannot neglect it
and we have some good ones and this will
close out our podcast we have couple
pieces here the first is from Brendan
Clark high pocket no team I'm due for a
new phone soon as my 24 month contract
expires soon my question is is it worth
making the jump from my iphone to
Windows Phone it seems that Windows
Phone gets quite a lot of attention from
you guys during the podcast being a
massive HTC fan I'm looking at the 8x8 s
or possibly the Lumia 920 what are your
thoughts especially in regards to app
support and Windows Phone ecosyst
mmm somebody go first okay I can go
first it's not a problem it's all about
personal preference if you currently
have an iphone you most probably are
tied in with the ecosystem and I'm not
only talking apps and talking books
multimedia if you want to switch
absolutely go on and switch but the
today Adam doubt had a piece on Windows
Phone and it was like this this is not
the time to upgrade to a windows phone
and I strongly advocated in favor of
this idea in the comments and I was like
this the Lumia 920 is about to get a
refresh next week or in 10 days max so
why not wait for nine or ten days to see
what nakia has up its sleeve instead of
just buying something now and locking
yourself in with a two-year contract
either way you go just make sure you
play with a windows phone before first
or see if it suits your needs because
it's completely 180 degrees different
from what I phone is that's a that's a
really good point and I think that begs
a another mini discussion here when do
you guys think is the optimum time to
decide on what phoned by next as in what
phone as in different platforms or
within the platform it doesn't matter
just you know you have some dough or
your your contracts up and it's time to
buy a new phone what do you thinks the
best time of year the best time of the
year mmm I would I can tell you what a
while Michael thinks when it is not a
good time to buy it's it's never a good
time to buy 11 and a half months before
knowing that there's gonna be a new
announcement so if we expect the iphone
6 in October it's not a good time to buy
the iphone 5 and September August if
you're expecting the Lumia eos or
something at NBC now it's not a good
time and by analogy it is always a good
sign to buy a phone after the
announcement or at the beginning of its
availability because then you can have
the phone for as long as you can while
not feeling sour that in two or three
weeks or one month a new phone is out
which is better maybe at the same price
or even cheaper definitely it's not
worth waiting the six months so the
thing can go down in price by 50 bucks
like to get it
launched so that you get you have the
new the newest thing and not just for
vanity but sake but just because it'll
work the best then because it's getting
the most attention from everyone and any
bugs that are getting all that attention
are going to be fixed very quickly and
it seems like we agree on this and it's
the logical thing to do and I had some
very interesting comments going back and
forth in that in that thread and its
Oriole I people don't understand why are
you writing nokia off come on I'm not
I'm having your best interest in mind
wait 10 days then decide no I should buy
two now go on man knock yourself up I
don't know what your me and Jenny I've
never seen an irrational comment on a
Windows Phone post no it was probably me
I'm Idol magnets I'm joking uh you know
Brandon do you even it was that a
rhetorical question or do you have an
answer to what time of year what time of
year would you recommend you to buy a
new phone well as you guys were talking
my answer kind of changed I was going to
say it's it's after the trade show
season which is probably in the spring
after all the announcements happen but
OEMs don't want you to be able to
predict when to buy a phone because that
creates this waiting behavior they want
you to buy today yep so what they do is
they keep changing things I mean I think
for a while now Samsung's gonna do their
the galaxy s next event in the spring
but if you look at when events have
happened like these new york events
where HTC announces the 8x and where you
know I apple announces new iphone it
keeps changing and it's very difficult
to predict so if you if you take that
variability out i would say that around
you know May or June is a good time to
decide but then you're missing out on
all the fall announcements but then at
the fall announcements you know what
wait till those are over because you're
on the brink of the spring announcements
so it's a good time there's no time oh
wait I saw we don't buy any phones
anymore don't buy you just stop buying
phones you know what just listen to
listen to what we say we'll help you
locate oh I don't know what you mean
this conversation has filled me with
such a sense of futility that I'm just
gonna go tend to cows in a pasture
somewhere and never look at me
so Brandon thank you for your letter III
think just as a closing thought for me
you will experience a massive amount of
culture shock changing from the iOS to
the windows phone user interface if if
you find the windows phone user
interface to be pleasing to you I think
that the jump has never been easier I
think there are more apps on windows
phone now I don't think I know there are
more apps on windows phone now than
there have ever been before it is still
nowhere near at parody with iOS but if
you can find the apps you need I think
you'll have a good time I mean it's a
solid it's it's it's becoming a mature
platform so let's let's move on to
William who is written in a little while
ago and everyone says everyone's excited
about the m7 and s4 and I have no doubts
that the m7 is going to come out really
soon and I have no doubts that it's
going to be a great phone but the new
stuff this year isn't that much of a
leap from last year specs wise so
shouldn't non-geeks or even us consider
getting a 1x at half the price in 2013
what is HTC and Samsung gonna offer us
and then he goes I mean yeah go ahead i
was gonna stay I was gonna start but you
go ahead oh ok you want to start yeah
I'll start I just want to say that ever
William I think I answered this question
in the last paragraph I said or a couple
paragraphs ago where it's like don't it
I think if you're you people can be
different kinds of geeks for me I'm the
kind of guy who if the option arises for
me to either get the new hotness for 300
bucks or you last year's rewarmed thing
for a hundred dollars cheaper I'm gonna
get the new thing and not because I'm
rich and not because I just have money
to throw away but because I eat your
brew thing exactly I want a future-proof
and I have an interest in getting the
thing that it's being honed and talked
about the most so that's my answer
William and I've never been about specs
I've always been about experience so I
don't care if what the specs are if it
delivers a good experience go ahead run
it yeah so I I agree to I I'm inclined
to get the latest and greatest and it
will give me a sense of sadness inside
if I get a last generation phone but
that's just because I live and breathe
the stuff
my optimus G though this is I just
wanted to point that out let's go ahead
well I got it about a month ago anyway
so um so the m7 and the galaxy s4 I'm
going to talk about the m7 well actually
both both are going to have a 1080p
screen compared to the last gen of 720p
screens and in in our tests we we find
that there is a big difference between
1080p and 720p not not huge but there's
definitely a difference and it's
definitely more pleasing on the eyes the
other difference between generation last
and generation now is faster processors
the s4 pro it's much much better than
the Tegra 3 or even the better Tegra 3
that was in the 1x and then the one x+
and then also don't forget that in a
short period of time in a few months we
are getting android 5.0 I'm pie and if
you get a last generation for one year
probably gonna be waiting a while for
key lime pie unless you're gonna root
and install a third party rom if you get
the m7 or the galaxy s4 you will be
waiting a lot less time and you might
even get it out the door um so that's a
lot of uh I think that's a lot of good
reasons on why the m7 the galaxy s4 are
significant leaps over what we got last
year great Pretender to you have a
thought on that I agree with Brandon on
the on the last part that yes if you
have in mind to always tend to have the
latest from from google in terms of
Android than yes go with the the last
generation phone whichever is there on
the other side look at the galaxy s2
it's it's been like two years since it's
been launched at the 2011 mwc and it's
still holding on but then again to
counter at this point it's just now
getting jelly bean so it's you have to
decide whether you want a phone which
will be grown to be updated as soon as
possible or you're good with the
previous generation of Android and you
don't care that much about OS or specs
at that matter yeah that's I think we've
got a good spectrum of responses and
William hopefully you can do something
with that our last piece of listener
mail comes thank you for writing in by
the way
and thanks for waiting I know it took a
couple weeks for us to get to that one
and our last piece of lesser males from
Reuben thank you for the sandwich ah got
to see what you did there Reuben says hi
guys first of all I love the podcasts on
a regular visitor and I've been
listening to the podcasts since well
even the old ones before the repos thank
you awesome and Reuben has some helpful
information for from our last episode
where we had a podcast listener question
about stolen phone data you guys
remember that maybe you don't Reuben
uses an app called prey which is an open
source project with some nice features
like GPS tracking take pictures lock the
device and remote wipe and you can find
that at prey project com p r ey it looks
like they're in some kind of beta phase
right now and also since and he points
out that since android for he thinks
android supports full device encryption
and there's a link to some some
information on that so that's just kind
of a rare listener mail piece letting a
previous listener look question
answering a previous listen here's
question your own previous episode and
we really really appreciate that ribbon
thank you do we still have a couple of
minutes um yeah I me I gotta pee but
otherwise yeah no man if you if you if
you happen to lose your iPhone you go to
iCloud you can locate it remotely wipe
it bring it and cycle to do these kinds
of things on other platforms I mean I
remember the windows phone 7 had
something similar with your with your
live account you can do that what is it
with Android that that there's a huge
problem that you have to get a dedicated
application for this doesn't google
support out of the box the service you
don't have to pay anything else just go
to I don't know your google account you
have all your phones listed them from
there you can lock it bring it wipe it
ok no they did they don't I mean there
are ways to do it like you mentioned a
third-party way in fact I think that's
gonna be one of the tenets of key lime
pie is better integration of services
you know d it's it's it's kind of
haphazard right now you've got all these
link Picasso
to sink and books inc and all these
different but it's it's not a other
stream line service and they don't have
the remote device management out of the
box and so I think I think that's coming
and also there are some third-party your
third but there are some OEMs who are
doing and building it into their skins
like Samsung has just started this big
push that we've seen commercials for
where there there is it safe right there
they're doing that enterprise security
stuff and like they've got that vague
commercial that's like we everything
needs to have the same security
protocols as the galaxy s3 and the note
2 and it's like what does that mean and
then I look it up I'm like oh ok yeah so
Samsung is making a big push into
providing into filling those gaps that
Google has not filled all right but I
Brendan I don't know if if we're gonna
see that in key lime pie but I hope we
do because it would be really cool to
have the kind of robust iOS remote
device management that Tony talks about
so good call that's a that's it for for
listener mail thanks everyone for for
writing in and before we close out the
show we have one final announcement as I
understand gentlemen Friday 2pm pocket
