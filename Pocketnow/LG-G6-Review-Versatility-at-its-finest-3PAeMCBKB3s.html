carrying two phones the small one has
always been my communicator since large
phones can be uncomfortable to handle
with one hand and the large one has
always been my media powerhouse since
consuming content is always better on a
large display but what if a company
decided to do something different
instead of making you choose either or
what if a company made a phone that
could serve both needs just fine I'm
happy that I'm a pocket now and this is
our full review of the LG G 6 to
describe the LG G 6 in a word
I think versatile would be the most fit
I mean seriously what else can you call
a product that's designed to solve
specific needs without affecting core
experiences and by needs I actually mean
the possibility of handling the phone
with one hand all the while being large
enough to help you enjoy a good video
while you're on the go to achieve this
we have a few genius design moves the
bezels have gone reduced significantly
providing an insane 80 percent screen to
body ratio the display became taller now
to buy one an aspect ratio and since
they went fancy why not throw in some
curves to the corners of the display in
order to make it stronger in case of a
fall actually by fancy we're talking
about this build the aluminum trim is
actually slimmer than it seems but it
provides an amazing sense of grip when
you hold the phone in the back now glass
has managed to set a sizable battery in
addition to dual cameras all this flush
to the chassis and even including ip68
water and dust resistance the overall
effect is surreal on the table and in
the hand this phone feels small but
trust me this is not really a camera
trick
what hasn't been so surreal at least in
the opinion of some is the choice for
internals we have a Snapdragon 801
processor with four gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of expandable storage all which are
either steps back or adjacent to devices
like the one plus 3t which cost a lot
less than this phone many people are
complaining of the fact that this phone
did not wait for the Snapdragon 835 but
have you asked me I really haven't
complained one bit about the performance
in nearly a month of using both the demo
unit and this final product whether it's
your standard daily usage your the most
demanding of games I have yet to find a
spouse better with anything so I think
that waiting for the Snapdragon 835
would have just been a waste of time my
favorite thing about this phone is
honestly the display we have 5.7 inch
quad HD plus panel at 28 80 by 1440 that
LG is dubbing its full vision display
this is still IPS technology but now
capable of Dolby vision and HDR 10 which
is now available on certain Netflix
content
color accuracy is top-notch and if your
content is of 18 by 9 aspect ratio you
will feel right at home
sadly applications like YouTube have not
yet been enhanced to enjoy this new
resolution but we have a feeling this is
not going to take that long and the
second thing that I enjoy about this
panel is the always-on mode which makes
a return and adds extra functionality
that we did not see with its predecessor
this 18 by 9 or 2 by 1 aspect ratio is
actually quite practical for LG's new UX
6.0 which takes advantage of the fact
that you've got two perfect squares at
the top and the bottom most of the user
interfaces design as a split of areas at
the top and the bottom as a result and
since this phone runs new good split
window multitasking actually feels like
if it was designed for this particular
aspect ratio which is genius LG
continues to push for extra
functionality by adding navigation
buttons for the notification tray but
you know what's missing here LG a menu
button or a context button or whatever
you want
call this thing because to be honest
with you I rarely ever use the qslide
option or the capture button and the
biggest problem about having a tall
display like this is those hamburger
menus at the top which are definitely
not reachable with one hand and about
everything else I love how this the LG
launcher has become and yes if you'd
prefer the option for the app tray it is
also here when it comes to the
experience of using the g6 as my daily
driver I give this phone a solid a -
phone calls are loud and caller said
that I sound clear and one is very
optimistic about the audio quality of
the phone through the headphone jack
even without the quad Zack that's
offered overseas sadly for me I just
cannot get over the lack of stereo
speakers yes I do agree this is probably
one of the loudest single firing
speakers I've ever heard but that's
until you muffle this thing which just
hinders the users hardware we'll go back
to education and that same rating is
what I'd give to battery life our final
review unit still runs on Android 7.0
and since it still elects the battery
enhancements of 7.1 the device barely
reaches a day of moderate use through
this power pack where charge 3.0 does
come to the rescue for a quick top-up
and yes if you're in the US you also get
the option of wireless charging now
where I'd give this phone a solid 8 plus
and even in that is extra plus if I
could is with the camera experience now
LG has spent the last two years in
pressing with their camera performance
and the g6 has taken what was already
good to a great level this year we have
dual 13 megapixel cameras both sporting
the same sensor the primary of F 1.8
aperture at 71 degrees the field of view
and the secondary at a 2.4 aperture at
125 degrees this creates the illusion of
optical zoom but instead of getting
closer to a subject it allows you to go
farther it became really convenient in
my recent trip to the Vatican and then
Barcelona as there are certain areas
where you simply can't step away to get
a better shot and where the d6 just
solved this need brilliantly the added
megapixels of the wide-angle camera and
the reduction of the field of view have
allowed me to trust it just as much as I
would trust the primary with great color
saturation and detail in addition to
less barrel distortion than what you get
with the lgb 20 or the old g5 the selfie
camera can also be used in a wide angle
mode of 100 degrees of field of view or
a standard crop depending on your needs
if you want to step things up a notch I
would highly suggest you watch ones real
camera review mainly because he praises
these manual controls and I actually do
too particularly because they finally
make it to video and speaking of video
this is another area where having a
wide-angle lens makes filming anything
more practical even a stability is mixed
depending on what camera you're using
overall the versatility of the LGG 6 is
unquestioned this is a phablet that
feels like a standard smartphone with a
set of cameras that adapt to your
surroundings and with looks that will
turn heads no matter where you go
even with its minor shortcomings it's
really hard to even compare the g 6
against any other phone fact of the
matter is that this phone is currently
on a league of its own so much so that
it's already putting a lot of 2017
competitions ashamed
really there is only so much I can tell
you on a video this is one of those
products that I highly suggest you go to
a store and experience for yourself and
also one that I would highly suggest you
buy Bravo LG
