taken i was a big fan of dragon ball two
i may get your day straight it's
wednesday not tuesday today and no today
saturday i mean you're an apple fanboy
and michael is a microsoft man well you
know it michael will not agree that's
right it's that time of the week i am hi
Mary better this is pocket now and this
is the pocket out daily recap for last
week brought to you by lynda.com so on
Monday asked you if you would buy the
nexus 6 or a nexus 5 now that the Nexus
5 is out on retail again we have 693
comments out of which bugs bunny love to
have you with us says the Nexus 5 feels
a little outdated not because of the
specs but because of what it used to
compete for after almost two years in
the market the price should drop to at
least a hundred dollars off each model
and yes you do have a solid point there
yes it's two years ago hardware it
should drop in price a little more but
then again it's not like if the Nexus 5
was ever pricey and javon says I'm
watching this video from the Nexus 5 and
I'm enjoying this if I have to choose
one I choose the one with the smaller
display the nexus 6 display is just too
big and I think the rest of the world
agrees with you and not everybody wants
a phablet I'm a big fan but not always
and Roger Toledo says the Nexus 6
because it is all the things that I like
Emily display 2k resolution and
front-facing speakers yes but that's not
the only phone that brings these things
then on Tuesday asks you what color
options do you want for the galaxy s6 as
the rumors are that we have a white dark
blue teal and gold variants coming soon
we have 490 comments out of which one of
them says black or white or classic
colors that never get old but I've been
fond of even though I'm not a verizon
wireless customer I like some of
variants like the red xperia z3 where
the football skin Moto X and i love the
nokia lumia 920 in ferrari red but
colors vary it depends on people and
Khushi says hey Samson rather than
bringing different kind of s6 models
this time is to focus on your UI in
design make it smooth sleek bring
gunmetal gray color and take my money I
am sick and tired of hearing about
TouchWiz up yes apparently that is going
to be fixed and yeah I would love a
gunmetal grey galaxy s6 as well and
Michael
menaces the color of a phone is
overrated to be honest as long as the
specs in the design is on point the
color doesn't matter to me agree anyone
you have 38 likers but there were four
hundred ninety comments that's less than
nine percent so I guess not everybody
agrees with you but yeah for some people
like me two years ago black was the way
to go but then again new colors do seem
cool a bit then on Wednesday asked you
would you like and I feel like design or
a samsung like design for the galaxy s6
as we've got some leaks the shows a
device that looks a lot like the iphone
6 we have 19 and 33 comments out of
which Kailyn says Samson go ahead copy
apples design I dare you no matter what
you do the damage has been done with
your laggy and bloated software and your
plasticky and cheap yes still the same
price for the iphone smartphones um yeah
I guess Samsung and do that it's done it
before and it's got sued like crazy so
yeah I would dare sams like to do it
again as well and Carlin Brannon says
personally I'd be happy as if Samsung
would completely stole apples design and
had an aluminum back I like everything
would Samson better than Apple except
the design LOL and i'm having a little
bit of a tough time understanding your
comment but yes i would love a samsung
galaxy a5 for example brought a full
aluminum design but i would love to see
that on the galaxy s6 i've just never
really been a fan of aluminum because
it's not as durable as plastic oddly
that another commoner says you didn't
copy apple design but you cannot copy
apple superior apps ecosystem smoothness
and speed and their phones their
superior fingerprint sensor and i think
that's where all companies want to go
you have a point Apple has done a very
good job and everything that it's done
but then again the company has lacked
behind the other things that have been
important for consumers that's the
reason why galaxy phones sell like crazy
and why most of us love the Moto X and
it's not that Apple's perfect but yeah
what they do right like the fingerprint
scanner is something that everybody
should replicate then on Thursday I
asked you if you would choose the swatch
SmartWatch concept that's being rumoured
over every other as the rumors are that
this will be a SmartWatch that won't
need to be charged ever we have 10 9
comments out of which proudly says I
choose the Apple watch and sell it for
high price and buys swatches smartwatch
and hopefully have money to spare
I'm not sure the swatch SmartWatch will
be that affordable and Hashim says
definitely yeah I mean it's a swatch and
I do agree swatch makes really cool
designs and rashad says swatch is a
recognized leisure II watch brand then
with a lifetime battery it's the best
buy and I agree with you my biggest
problem of smartwatches really is the
battery life that's the fact that I have
to charge them everyday watches were not
made to be this way and the fact that I
have to charge at every single time it's
just the way it go things backwards in
the past smartphones regular phones
their batteries were terrible and
smartphones have done a better job than
these phones so it does make sense to
move to a smartphone but the case of
smartwatches it's the other way around
then finally on Friday asks you what
would you pick galaxy s edge or galaxy
s6 as we have the first leaked photos of
what these devices look like and they
look really cool we have one in 23
comments out of which names don't matter
says how would you hold a double-edged
phone that is a good question but i'm
sure the designers figure that one out
and tickles to coffee says and they were
the same price i would consider it but i
just need some hands-on time to be sure
and also damn you samsung just when you
think that i am done with you you make a
sexy-looking galaxy s6 and i do agree
with you that's what samsung is trying
to do actually they're trying to get
people back into their ecosystem so yes
sexy design has a lot to do with it and
then finally another commenter says i
don't give a flying f about the edge i
just want a removable battery and that's
something that's got us a little concern
if you look at the leaked renders it
seems that these phones will not have a
replaceable battery so this could be a
step back moving forward to what we
currently see with the galaxy alpha
lineup not necessarily something we like
but hey if they figure out good battery
life and why not it's famous on the note
wine i'm so how about if they do it on
the galaxy s6 as well we'll see and
folks have you've ever wanted to learn
