Motorola X phone hardware gets leaked
along with a new name and Google pens
the way for you to control your
smartphone from its back I'm high memory
vana and on my book smartphones are the
ones that are actually capable of
delivering you food and this is
PocketNow daily so if the BlackBerry z10
is on your wish list AT&amp;amp;T has just
confirmed their launch details it's
gonna be available on retail as soon as
March 22nd but if you want to play it
safe you can pre-order it on March 12th
and it'll retail for the usual 200 bucks
after a two-year contract even though
we're kind of wondering how big is this
launch gonna be if well the z10 is done
well in some parts of Europe but not
really that great so far now let's
continue talking about nokia a new
leaked internal document confirms that
the company is still worried about their
Windows Phone strategy apparently
according to the document it states that
if Microsoft
loses interest in the operating system
or kills the operating system altogether
as they've done in the past well notice
smartphone strategy pretty much goes
down the drain but the most interesting
part about the document is the fact that
the officials with a Nokia are stating
that obviously if Microsoft would ever
come out with a surface phone they would
become a competitor and it's just
interesting because all of us thought
that that surface phone that ever would
be built by Nokia so stay tuned for the
rumors now let's move over to Motorola
and yeah that's that company that builds
cell phones you know the one that
actually invented the cell phone and
that was bought by Motorola and that
people sadly don't care about anymore
well we've been waiting for their ex
phone for the longest time and well we
don't have any images of the phone yet
but we do have a leaked banner now that
talks about the Motorola next as an NXT
and though we don't know if that next
could be that it's the ex phone and
that's the next best thing as part of
the marketing campaign now the images of
the phone are kind of blurry it's hard
to tell if this is really the phone but
they'll stay tuned we have some links in
the description for the full
specifications this device does bring
some iron ease apparently the chipset
will not support CDMA and we know that
Motorola and the Droid branding are
pretty much one thing stay tuned and
yeah let's continue talking about the
parent company of Motorola which is
Google they've just filed a new patent
that allows you to control your smart
both with the display and also with the
back now this patent is not new we've
seen it before for years a lot of
companies have filed us as a new
technology that they want to bring but
sadly we still have not seen it we've
seen it in some game controllers out
there but not really in a smartphone so
it's just interesting to see if Google
will probably figure it out stay tuned
the next Nexus device could be the thing
and finally for the hot news of the day
we finally finally have some leaked
photos of the Galaxy s4 and it looks a
lot like the galaxy s3 if you look at it
though apparently the display is
obviously a little bigger but it seems
like a galaxy s3 almost everywhere the
back looks a lot like the Galaxy Note 2
with that speaker grille at the bottom
but still a lot of people are already
disappointed about the fact that there's
just an iteration of the old device but
that leads into the question of the day
do you like this phone in the leek
runners do you believe that this is the
galaxy s4 in my particular case well
just how much can Santa invent the wheel
I like the design of the galaxy s3 but I
don't know about you so leave us a
