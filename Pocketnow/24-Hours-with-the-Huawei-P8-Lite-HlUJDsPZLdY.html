the fawley p8 Lite and the foie we
talked pan b2 as both devices try to
make treads for the Chinese manufacturer
in the US of A we'll have more on how
the wearable works in another video but
right now we have our first day's worth
of impressions of the cousin - always
current international flagship I'm Jules
Wong with pocket now let's dive into the
hallway p8 Lite I've said it once I'll
say it again diet soda ain't the real
thing and that comes to the build the p8
Lite does not have a metal body like the
p8 does but what far we chose to do with
plastic try to get close in its own
right the light sports a very tactile
plastic that imitates a brushed metal
all over this lab well it takes some
getting used to pulling it in your hand
on the bright side fingerprints didn't
cause much trouble for us it's a solid
fit and finish though a bit lightweight
for the field the power and volume
config on the right rail works ok
holding for the device but in pocket it
can be a little confusing figuring out
which button is which the device
supports dual SIM cards but there's a
hybrid slot for either micro SD or a
nano SIM fYI 720p at 5 inches has become
commonplace in the mid-range market and
the LCD panel here proves no exception
the colors are vibrant though the blacks
are at at shallow the visibility is okay
in most situations but pretty struggling
in sunlight and the reflectivity can put
a damper on the visibility angles inside
emui or mui fits us to endless em
screens with a ton of settings with
amenities and custom software
enhancements like a memory manager i
tend not to use that because i prefer to
manage my own ram snapdragon 615 SOC
pulls through many apps just fine web
browsing ok but the GPU struggles a bit
when
get some tents the speakers on the p8
Lite do take from the p8 it's loud but
easily muffled if you did not check out
our camera article on pocketnow.com the
one-word summary here is mediocre over
on Durin's seems to be quite impressive
though we'll need a bit more time to
experiment just now our preliminary
assessment is that the p8 Lite seems to
show some of Wali's heritage with the
said mate to how the rest of the p8 Lite
measures all of the above together we'll
have to see in our full review in the
meantime if you have a question about
the p8 Lite or talk that'd be to drop
them in the comments below the thumbs up
button is down below too as well as that
subscribe button until next time I'm
Jules Wong and Greenpoint 0 on Twitter
and let there be light sorry see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
