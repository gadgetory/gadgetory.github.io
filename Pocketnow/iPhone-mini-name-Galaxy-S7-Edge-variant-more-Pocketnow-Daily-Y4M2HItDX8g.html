gain a new name other reports have the
samsung galaxy s7 edge making a debut
and sony teases yet another xperia for
announcement I'm hangin ravenna and
following last week's trend I'm not
going to complain about monday I'm not
gonna complain about monday again this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with AT&amp;amp;T for those of you
that have been wanting unlimited data
for the longest time well it's back but
not necessarily in a good way as number
what it will cost you hundred bucks
number two you have to actually sign up
to either a TNCs directv or u-verse for
you to be able to use this meaning that
if you can already live with Netflix and
without cable you're pretty much tied up
to that and there are a lot of other
conditions that I would rather you read
in the lecture the description and then
when it comes to teaser is we've been
waiting for Sony to actually do
something good with its Xperia lineup
and the company is teasing that there is
a new Beauty coming tomorrow but by
tomorrow we're not exactly sure if they
mean soon meaning mwc or if we're
actually hitting a new product tomorrow
so stay tuned as obviously so need to
some good phones they just don't get the
popularity they deserve now as will the
spotlight over to Samsung as we are even
more confused now as to what to expect
for the galaxy s7 particularly because
we've heard that there's a plus parent a
plus edge variant and now we hear that
there will be a regular 5.1 inch display
variant with a niche display in a 12
megapixel camera and that's all
megapixel camera is really what's
concerning as it would mean sort of a
step back to what we currently have with
this year's unit or should I say last
year's but anyways we will keep you
posted let's see exactly what Samson
comes up with and for those of you
interested in the iphone many rumors
that product that we expect for either
March or April this is rather
interesting it seems that it won't be
called the iphone 6c apparently it'll be
called the iphone 5 e we're getting an
a8 chip which is last year's unit in
addition to that we are getting Apple
pay according to these rumors obviously
we're not exactly sure if this will just
be a rehash of the iphone 5s but
hopefully it won't be a bad rehash in
the end and finally the very hot new
today have to do with HTC as the
company's CEO and chairman chair Wang
was on record recently again and this
time when being asked about the teacher
of the smartphone portfolio and
everything her response was rather
interesting according to her vr is more
important than smartphones right now
it's not to say that smartphones aren't
important it's just to say that the
company is betting a lot of its guns on
the HTC vive experience and given the
fact that we've actually been able to
test the vibe over the last few days at
CES we totally understand HTC this is a
really really good product but it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you really believe that the future is VR
headsets would you be interested in
buying the HTC vive for example in my
case it will all depend on the price tag
because the experience is amazing but
then again not everybody will be able to
afford it it seems leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion and as always you know the drill
