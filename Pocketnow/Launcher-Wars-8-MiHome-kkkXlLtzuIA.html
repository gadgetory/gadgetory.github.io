giving them a little personality that
can be done by flashing custom rom or by
installing a custom launcher app today
we're going to talk about my home
launcher I'm Joe Levi this is launcher
wars episode 8 so this is my home
launcher it just came up with an update
there are two different varieties one
for those of us running Android for bass
drums and those of us are running
android 2.3 this is version 4 or for
Android 4 and it kind of shows you what
it can do the first thing you're going
to notice is we have animated widgets
that's something that in the past has
been reserved only to HTC sense now you
can get it on other things now this if
it looks at all familiar to you it's
probably because you've seen me you'ii
or my UI I don't know how you want to
pronounce it or how it's supposed to be
pronounced but mi UI it's an Android
distribution a custom rom that is
developed almost entirely in China for
Android but it gives an entirely new
look and feel kind of iOS ish in fact
there's a lot of overtones of Apple's
operating system that you'll find but
with a very distinct android flavor it's
very polished and looks really really
good but of course you have to flash a
custom rum a lot of us don't like doing
that or don't want to forgo our warranty
so this is a custom launcher you simply
download and install it from the android
market or the google play store i'll
have a link for it over in the article
at pocketnow.com and it essentially
replaces your launcher and makes it look
just like the me you Eeyore the miui
custom rom complete with my locker so
overall what you'd expect a very long
paginate 'add home screen we can tap and
hold on it and get even more where we
can add and whatever we want to there's
a
we'll search can add another we just
keep adding and adding and adding now
there's no app drawer at least not one
that I could find everything appears to
be right here put together on the home
screen so things that you don't want to
use you just move off to the side so
that they're right there they're
accessible but you don't have to launch
a separate launcher app for you to get
into now you just saw a notification
come through those of you who are
familiar with the the custom rom will
notice this is not the custom rom
interface for that for the drop down for
the notification bar for the
notification shade this is stock Android
or whatever came on your Android it's
not changing that to do that you've got
to have root access you've got to do
through a custom rom this doesn't have
that level access so some of the
components are going to stay stuck to
whatever stock is on your device but you
can see very quickly and easily what you
can do there we can come in and look at
settings we can change the transition
effect between the the pages I've got it
set it cascading now let's set it to
rotation will go back and show you that
in just a minute you can change your
wallpapers live wallpapers lock screen
wallpapers and desktop wallpapers will
get to lock screens here really quickly
we can change the wallpaper scroll type
which can be set by either the theme or
you can manually set it to whatever you
would like in there as well this is a
setting i really like keep the launcher
in the memory so it's going to do
everything it can to keep this launcher
app from being dumped out of memory when
extra memory is needed elsewhere that
means going back to the launcher is
going to be a lot faster than it
otherwise would if it would have to
reload it back into memory so I like
that setting icon shadow just some eye
candy for how you want the icons to look
on the home screen then do we want to
use the my home locker so this is the
lock screen and it's gorgeous and it's
thema Bowl unfortunately it's an in
addition to your current lock screen so
if you've already got a lock screen now
you have to
you unless you turn one or the other off
you can change the style this is what I
have locally and it's just very nice or
you can go online and pick out one of
many many many lock screens including
these nice little zippers no innuendo
there right and just lots of other
things that you can do simply download
them a lot of them you don't know what
they're called because they're written
in Chinese this is a Chinese development
house that does this so not quite as
translated as I'd like it to be but it's
impressive to see all of this coming
from a one group of developers over in
China and still have it look as polished
and is usable in English I'm sure a lot
of us us or other developers throughout
the world aren't doing quite as much for
our friends over in China and
internationalizing for them we can
enable haptic feedback enable sound
effects and this is a translation i just
have to point it out because i find it
humorous and it made me smile we can
activate the one key locker now what
does this do I have no idea but what it
says it does is enabling it can perform
one key locker and make locking
automatically perfect after lighting up
the screen that sounds good enough for
me now to do this you have to have
administrative privileges it controls
the lock screen I haven't done that
before I really don't want to just yet
so I'm going to cancel out of it some
other things in here as break you and
then some about information this is
version 1.0 point one I just got it this
morning I've been using the previous
version up until this point so there we
go back to home now you can see that new
3d flip like I was telling you really
kind of cool nice fade transition little
pinwheel there let's go ahead and turn
it off wait just a few seconds for the
lock screen to kick in we'll turn it
back on and here you can see the my home
lock screen simply drag down to unlock
but you've got these four quadrants
launched phone launched camera or
launched messaging you can unlock now
this is my stock
unlocker i'll go ahead and unlock that i
will then put in my secret code and i'm
at my home screen obviously you wouldn't
have three levels of protection on yours
that's just you know what I've got set
up for online overall really cool really
impressive I love the animations and I
love the fact that it carries through a
lot of the things that you've come to
know and love about the miui custom rom
but it puts it into a package that you
can get and download on virtually any
Android powered device to replace your
launcher so you can get some of that
miui look and feel right there on your
phone without rooting and without custom
drumming I like it let me know what you
think head over to pocketnow.com leave
your comments on that article over there
I'll have a link to the article down
below this video if you're watching it
over on youtube if you're watching it on
pocket now just scroll down and leave
your comments down there let me know
what you like what you don't like what
they didn't include from my UI that you
wish they would have and if you've got a
recommendation for an upcoming episode
