welcome to the puck and nail I review
the show we go for all this week school
and the not so cool is how the world of
Apple's iOS devices the start this week
off with the cool tis the season to be
jolly and to go on spending sprees
unless of course heels make it their
first that's just the case with EA
Mobile since they're offering this daily
deal service on applications and in some
cases like quite control HD you can even
get these applications for free
hit the link is in description for a
mobile site where you can get details on
which games are free today and which
games are on sale because this only
happens for one day for each application
and will speed up deals ATM tease
variants of the iPhone for us and for 30
bucks off in discount on Radio check
next week so make sure you watch out for
that because Apple never puts their
phones on sale and definitely after
Black Friday now the big news of the
week is the fact that we've got video
proof and untethered jailbreak for iOS 5
from pod2g now the bad news here is that
sadly was tested all on our last
generation iPod Touch if you look at the
video closely now since we already know
that the processor pretty much matches
the one of the iPhone 3GS from last two
years in eration back we're honestly not
sure what's gonna happen for the vices
like the iPhone 4s or for we usually
milled it onto their delbridge reach
first the iPhone 3GS with the old boot
rom so this could just be the case but
we could also just cross our fingers and
hope for the iPhone 4s and want to be
supportive whenever that happens
speaking of hack said that seems own
muscle nerd just recently tweeted that
he figured out how to dump the baseband
boot ROM but the iPhone 4s and well
judging by the smiley it seems that we
could probably have a carrier unlock for
the iPhone 4s soon now sadly this news
is only for GSM AT&amp;amp;T owners because well
not really sure if he's going to be able
to unlock the Verizon and Sprint
carriers for that SIM card that's
embedded for world travel so let's see
what happens in the future advances are
better than no advances at all so we'll
keep you posted as news develop we'll
has this launched it in service called
Google Currents then intends to compete
with Flipboard on your iPhone and iPad
by bringing you feeds of your content in
a magazine style UI the app is free and
it's quite cool so make sure you hit the
link at the description to subscribe to
our pocket now turn on your iOS and
Android device so far we must admit the
service is quite awesome and worth using
since it brings you all the experience
of our concept and video in one place so
hit the link in the description and
subscribe now gamers and fans of the
online streaming service for games will
be happy to know that things are almost
set for their titles to be streamed on
iOS and Android devices yes that does
include tablets and even the controls
are gonna work now not sure when that
will be but if you're a fan of
assassin's creed well you'll be pleased
to know
that'll be released soon so that
something becomes a reality before or
next year hopefully
that does it for the coolest consider
while with the not so cool in well iOS
5.1 was recently released the develop
version why are we celebrating well so
far all of us have tested the bill that
it seems to not bring any improvements
in battery life to any iOS device you
could probably debate and battle with me
by telling me this is beta software but
still there's an ax beta application
there for us to test it
well we're testing it and we're telling
Apple that it's not working so please
figure it out or the prices are barely
getting through the day that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm time enemy better remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
