demonstrated on video steps closer into
a carrier unlock for the iphone 4s and
even though iOS 5.1 reach developers
you'd wonder why are we happy all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm kind of event and welcome
to the puck and nail I review the show
we go for all this week school and then
I so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices the start this week off with
the cool tis the season to be jolly and
to go on spending sprees unless of
course deals make it their first that's
just the case with EA mobile since
they're offering this daily deal service
on applications and in some cases like
quite control HD you could even get
these applications for free hit the link
in the description for EA mobile site
where you can get details on which games
are free today in which games are on
sale because this only happens for one
day for each application and will speed
up deals AT&amp;amp;T is variants of the iphone
4s and for now get 30 bucks off and
discount on radio shack next week so
make sure you watch out for that because
apple never puts their phones on sale
and definitely after Black Friday now
the big news of the week is the fact
that we've got video proof and
untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 from
pod2g now the bad news here is that
sadly it was tested all on our last
generation ipod touch if you look at the
video closely now since we already know
that the processor pretty much matches
the one of the iphone 3gs from last two
years in erations back we're honestly
not sure what's going to happen for
devices like the iphone 4s or four we
usually milled it unto their delbridge
reach first the iphone 3gs with the old
bootrom so this could just be the case
but we could also just cross our fingers
and hope for the iphone 4s and want to
be supportive whenever that happens
speaking of hack said that teams own
muscle nerd just recently tweeted that
he figured out how to dump the baseband
bootrom up the iphone 4s and well
judging by the smiley it seems that we
could probably have a carrier unlock for
the iphone 4s soon now sadly this news
is only for gsm AT&amp;amp;T owners because well
we're not really sure
going to be able to unlock the verizon
and sprint carriers for that SIM card
that's embedded for world travel so
let's see what happens in the future
advances are better than no advances it
also will keep you posted as news
develop rule has just launched it in
service called google currents that
intends to compete with footboard on
your iphone and ipad by bringing you
feeds of your content in a magazine
style you I the app is free and it's
quite cool so make sure you hit the link
in the description to subscribe to our
pocket now turn on your iOS and Android
device so far we must admit the service
is quite awesome and worth using since
it brings you all the experience of our
content end video in one place so hit
the link in the description and
subscribe now gamers and fans of the on
live streaming service for games will be
happy to know that things are almost
sets for their titles to be streamed on
iOS and Android devices yes that does
include tablets and even the controls
are going to work now not sure when that
will be but if you're a fan of
Assassin's Creed well you'll be pleased
to know that'll be released soon so
that's something becomes a reality
before or next year hopefully
that does it for the coolest considering
one with the not-so-cool in well iOS 5.1
was recently released the developers in
why are we celebrating well so far all
of us have tested the bill that it seems
to not bring any improvements in battery
life to any iOS device you could
probably debate in battle with me by
telling me this is beta software but
still isn't a beta application there for
us to test it well we're testing it and
we're telling ample that it's not
working so please figure it out are the
prices are barely getting through the
day that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm hi never be
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
