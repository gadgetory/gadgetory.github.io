this is the second in our HTC Desire HD
unboxing and review series what we got
today is a really cool device by HTC
android powered of course and in our
last video i showed you the unboxing
which is just taken everything out of
the box to show you what's in the box so
you know what to expect before you go to
the store to buy this now of course the
most important thing you guys want to
see is what does it look like what is
the UI how does it act how does interact
well this is the first boot and initial
impressions of the device so let's get
right to
okay before we get to first boot we have
to get into the battery compartment and
to do that you flip out this little
piece right here it's a little
rubberized plastic piece you pull that
out it's got a couple metallic contacts
on there which i think is just primarily
for continuity you've got your little
volume buttons and whatnot down here
that you press but the reason you have
to do this is you've got to remove this
little piece right here now that covers
up the battery contacts so that it
doesn't discharge the battery in transit
and whatnot so kind of interesting
there's not a true backplate like you'd
see on most phones just that little
thing so of course here's your battery
and while we're here let's go ahead and
take a look this is a 1230 milliamp hour
battery so a little bit smaller than
we're accustomed to the g2 is 1300 if
memory serves we'll just pop that
battery back in there and we will try
and slide that back in place and of
course this being as close to a live TV
as we can get it's nice to see me fumble
around with it the first time so if you
want to make fun of me comments down
below leave them right now anyway so it
snaps back together just like that works
really well now you might be thinking
where do I put other stuff like my sim
card or my micro SD card well that's
down here on the bottom which is equally
as frustrating to get off the more
frustrating it is to get off that means
the tighter fit it is usually so it's
not really a bad thing micro SD is right
there and this comes with a samsung
branded class to eight gig which i
believe is the same one that comes with
the g2 while we're here let me go ahead
and pop in my sim card from my g2 so we
can see exactly what it's going to look
like at first boot so here's my sim
we're just going to take that line up
our little tab see how that goes in and
it just slides right in place and we'll
take this bottom panel and put it back
in and it just snaps up there nice and
solid okay now that I've got
fingerprints all over the front of this
device let's see
if we can boot it up for the first time
pressing the power button at the top
left we're first met with the HTC logo
and you can see how much of this black
front screen area is occupied by that
screen that's just a huge screen well
just wait for it while it boots up now
of course first boots are longer than
any other boots first boots and of
course here when you flash a rom on it
we just got an HTC quietly brilliant
screen with a nice little HTC sound
still booting up the first time and
while we're waiting on that this does
come with a 1 gigahertz processor it has
1.5 gigabytes of internal storage in 768
megabytes of RAM size and weight if you
want to know that while we're in here it
is a 123 x 68 x just a little bit shy of
12 millimeters and weighs a hundred and
sixty four grams I'll get into more
detail about what that is in non-metric
units in the review that goes along with
this video so make sure you check in for
that it does have that 4.3 inch
touchscreen like we mentioned before
internal GPS and a whole bunch of
networking but we'll come back to that
in just a minute you'll see we're
preparing the SD card and we're met with
the HTC Sense UI just like you are
accustomed to screams lot so we're going
to drag down to unlock just very fluid
and we're back to the HTC screen and
this is most definitely a gsm phone
because i'm hearing that on my speakers
over in the corner
okay so I am at the configuration screen
and asked me to choose my language now
it's got english UK English Ireland I
don't see English us so I'm going to go
ahead and choose UK well say next using
the on-screen keyboard we're going to go
ahead and skip that transfer data we're
going to skip that we're going to go
ahead and skip all the way through this
but it lets you go through and set up
all of the sink devices like you would
expect now to make this process faster
i'm going to go ahead and set up my
Wi-Fi network and i'm going to do that
off screen and I'll be right back so I
went ahead and provided my wpa key and
I've got a little green checkmark next
to my Wi-Fi network will go ahead and
choose next accept the defaults on this
screen and we're just going to go ahead
and skip that process and skip through
all these as well this is where you get
to set up your social networks now the
reason that it puts all this first and
foremost is when you're using the sense
UI there are a lot of widgets and a lot
of things inside this UI this user
interface experience that tie into your
social networks stuffed another default
stock android doesn't have so they ask
for that information right up front now
the first thing that I'm noticing is
I've got these tip bubbles right here
which has a nice drop shadow I don't
know if that's part of sense UI or if
that's just part of this particular
widget but adds a nice level of three
dimensionality to it which I really
really like you notice up here on the
battery came with iconically about half
a battery which is not unusual for the
phone nice animations over here on the
clock by the way this is one of the
things I really like about the sense UI
and we've got just all kinds of cool
stuff so this is the sense UI that we're
used to a little bit updated a little
bit more fluid there's a lot of stuff
that I can show you in here but just for
a first first hand impressions let's
just keep going through the phone one of
the things that I like about the stock
android app drawer here is that it has
kind of a star wars ii 3d effect where
your icons kind of fade off into the
background of fade up down here on the
bottom this just has it flat now that
gets you more speed because you don't
need to have as much of a processor
behind it to display it so your speed is
a little bit quicker in here comes with
everything that you'd expect Adobe
Reader pre-configured camera camcorder
we'll look at those later in the video
even has a flashlight which some of you
call a torch and I'll just flip that
around and it has both of those LEDs
which light up very very bright I'll
just and apparently you can Wow bump up
the intensity so there is off there is
one there's two and there's three so you
can kind of see the intensity they're
really neat to have that even has an SOS
mode auto flash kind of neat anyway so
that's a flashlight app it's HTC branded
comes with the FM radio that has been
coveted by oh so many people you do have
to have your headset plugged in because
that's the antenna so it's not going to
let me go in and do anything but I can
listen to actual real live at FM radio
over the radio I mean it's just amazing
in phone is a radio too and I say that
kind of tongue-in-cheek because it's a
phone I've got internet on it I can
listen to pandora I can listen to
slacker I can listen to stuff that's on
here but anyway there you go it comes
with a whole bunch of stuff Teeter one
of my favorite games Wi-Fi hotspot built
in all kinds of neat stuff but just to
show you the initial impressions initial
setup an initial boot of the HTC Desire
HD there you go of course this is only
one in a series of videos about the HTC
Desire HD so you'll want to make sure
