pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to compare the internet browsing
experience of the zune HD the microsoft
product obviously with that of windows
mobile 6.5 which is also a microsoft
product you're going to see that they're
very very very different although we may
get a glimpse of what's in store for say
windows mobile seven through the zune HD
they've done an awesome job at at
designing this interface to be awesome
for a mobile device so let's take a look
we're in a drill into internet and the
amazing part of the browser on the zune
HD is it so minimal yet it works so for
example i'm going to stop it from
loading right now and I just do that by
hitting the X this is all the controls
you have to work with and yet from this
area you can do everything so I can
enter new URL by tapping on the URL down
here and I get this keyboard and we can
go into list I thought we'd go into
landscape I guess we can't to enter in a
new address we can tap and hold on this
button to delete the address and go to
another site such as you know pocket now
calm and now it's gone into landscape
and by default it brings up the mobile
page of the site you're trying to load
unfortunately I couldn't find a setting
to allow your device to only show the
full site let's go back now let's say
you want to add this to a favorite you'd
press the star down here you press add
and it's added very quick and easy and
let's say you want to call up a favorite
you press this button and here are all
my favorites I can tap and hold on any
of them kind of like windows mobile and
do delete from favorites again this was
achieved without any buttons of course
there is a learning curve to discover
these functions but it's amazing how
they were able to pack so much
functionality and tote into so few
buttons and in such an elegant interface
so let's take a look at sort of how this
compares to the browser experience that
we have coming up in windows mobile 6.5
with ie6 mobile so we are going to go to
Amazon on both of these devices and see
which one is faster they're both on the
same Wi-Fi connection let's do it
zune HD looks like it's going first
although the status bar is a long way to
go and zune HD is done and I think the
windows mobile 6.5 is pretty much done
here of course this is not a final build
of windows mobile 6.5 that you're
witnessing here this is a beta actually
of windows mobile 6.5 point one so that
may explain the slowness I'm going to
stop it there and show you how they kind
of compare in terms of rendering
fidelity so of course the zune HD is
multi-touch so you can kind of pinch
like so like you do on the iPhone or
other devices like the g1 or HTC Hero
double tap to zoom in resizes the column
beautifully you can scroll around you
don't get a checkerboard pattern on the
screen very very nice rendering a very
pleasant browsing experience let's take
a look at it on windows mobile 6.5 also
pretty smooth I'm not as good of course
it doesn't have multitouch and I just
did a Miss press there I was trying to
double tap on a column and it tried to
load it so you get the point there and
also notice how in windows mobile 6.5
microsoft has put the address bar at the
top and if you press this button you get
a bunch of buttons and yet the
functionality of this browser is about
the same as this browser but this
browser does it with much fewer buttons
and a real maximization of screen space
anyway this is a beta so you get the
point with that so a very refreshing
internet browser in in the zune HD let's
kind of click around and see what else
we can do it doesn't have flash support
and let's go to any one of these pages
this one's taking kind of a while to
load here it is so we can zoom in of
course and it's not done rendering there
it is move around on the screen got some
blank spots so it's not perfect but it's
quite good for a multimedia player
especially quite good out of micros
we didn't think that they could build an
amazing mobile browser but here it is on
the zune HD we're really hoping that
we're going to get something like this
or even better with flash support and
some more functionality in windows
mobile seven now what's interesting
about the zune HD is that all of the
settings occur outside of the programs
or as in Windows Mobile a lot of the
settings for a particular program are in
that program so there are calendar
options and the calendar app there are
internet options in the internet app but
what I think is a really good paradigm
and I think hopefully Microsoft welled
up for windows mobile seven is to clean
up the interface make it more
mobile-friendly they put all the
settings out in sort of a system wide
area it's going quite slow right now as
you can see okay and it's over here in
settings now obviously the internet
option has very few settings you can
delete history clear cookies and disable
script but that's pretty much it but a
very interesting idea of putting all of
the settings outside of the program to
really save on screen space and have a
great mobile experience so that's it for
the internet experience on the zune HD
very good not perfect it doesn't have
flash support which is a big problem
it's not the fastest browser but it's
very nice to see something that's quite
usable and even even a little bit
cutting edge out of Microsoft we hope
this is a sign of things to come in
windows mobile and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
