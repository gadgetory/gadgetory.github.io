window support to tablets something
integrates their camera and smartphone
departments to be more aggressive in
Apple's iWatch could be their first
attempt at wireless charging I'm hi mera
neta and if there ever was a beard
flavored coffee I'd be the first one in
line to get that I get that right Jacob
it was your joke this is walking out
daily letters they offered some official
news as skype for android has just
gotten better the company is just
implemented floating window supports of
video chats meaning you can multitask
while you're on your and that's really
the catch while you're on your tablet
this only works for Android tablets
right now but it is a step in the right
direction you can multitask to different
applications different services while
you're on a video chat it is great
because you really want to do that
sometimes on your tablet you've got all
that canvas to do that so let's see what
happens with the iOS since things happen
last on Windows Phone now if you thought
that Google didn't pay attention to your
complaints about the nexus 5 like again
the company has just sent out a new
batch of Nexus 5 hardware you know new
phones and they do bring bigger speaker
holes for those that were complaining
about the speaker quality on the Nexus 5
and they're also fixing the SIM tray as
well but it's sad to see that those
people that actually bought the phone
first won't be getting this revision
because it's a hardware revision but
it's great to see that it's happening at
least the less people will complain
right and even though the merger between
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile did not happen it
seems that there is a new company
interested in this is sprint apparently
they're interested in working on a
merger this is just a rumor right now
nothing specific but it's really sad as
t-mobile has recently been making
changes that have actually disrupted the
smartphone market in the United States
and when we're thinking that they were
headed in the right direction it's sad
to see them go if they do because most
likely Sprint will be the hire company
but we'll see now let's talk about
apolis we're getting more rumors of the
iWatch and apparently Apple is willing
to leave their comfort zone when it
comes to the design of this watch they
don't like wireless charging and still
one of the biggest rumors right now is
that apparently they will be
implementing that with the iWatch which
is interesting since their lightning
cable is really small we were expecting
that to be the same charger for the
iWatch but stay tuned these are just
rumors let's see what happens early next
year
and finally for the hot news of the day
Samson has just decided to merge their
camera imaging department with their
smart phone and mobile department which
is really interesting we've got the
galaxy s4 zoom the galaxy camera the
Galaxy NX so it doesn't make sense for
us to get better camera phones or phones
that are cameras or whatever but we also
want better imaging quality and it's
interesting since Samsung has decided to
ditch the whole optical image
stabilization so 2014 is going to be a
very interesting year but that leads me
to the question of the day what would
you like Samsung to innovate with this
merger because for example in my
particular case what I would love is to
have a smartphone that does not require
expandable lenses but then you can also
attach them like we've seen some clips
for the iphone I'd love to see that
officially come from Samson but leave us
a comment down below and yeah not so
bloated as the sony one and we'll see
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is spill make sure you follow us
