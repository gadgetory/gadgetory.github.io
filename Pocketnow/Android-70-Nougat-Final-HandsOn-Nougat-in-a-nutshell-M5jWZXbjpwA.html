installed it on our Nexus 5x thanks to
public betas Android 7.0 nougat has been
one of the better documented Android
releases now in a proper consumer forum
here's a quick tour around Google's
latest sweet treat
nougat brings a number of UI tweaks to
the table which we've come to appreciate
from manufacturer skins my favorite
addition are these quick toggles in the
notification shade no longer requiring a
double swipe or two finger pull your
first five quick settings are right here
and everything in this notification
shade has gotten a lot smarter quick
settings are accessed directly here
before shuffling you off to the full
settings menu more apps will support
proper replies directly from the
notification and multiple notifications
from the same app are bundled more
efficiently oh and those apps that spam
you can be silenced here too also handy
our new multitasking options quick
switch works like an alt tab on a PC to
juggle between two apps but sometimes
you just need both of them on the screen
at the same time so now we finally get
proper split screen support baked right
into the OS data and battery options
have been polished up data saver
provides better limits and thresholds
for managing background data use and
doze is now called doze on-the-go
allowing the phone to go into a
low-power State even when you're moving
if the phone is in a pocket or a purse
this will hopefully eke out a little
more runtime during the day the update
process has been improved even moving
from the dev preview to the official
release we didn't have to sit through
updating apps which was really nice and
direct boot maintains a secure
environment for your data while
launching apps and services faster in
the background even before you put in
your password fewer worries there as
your info is encrypted at the file level
and because people seem to care about
these things there are a figurative
metric ton of emojis you should be able
to manage all of your interpersonal
communications via hieroglyphics now may
be more practical your keyboard now has
better language support there are also a
number of tweaks under the hood a new
JIT compiler and support for Vulcan
api's should improve in app and gaming
performance built into nougat is better
support for VR but we won't really be
able to test that out directly until we
get daydream compat
hardware lastly we get a few helpful
tweaks for clearing multitasking apps
and notifications and a new emergency
page will let you list info like your
blood type and allergies alongside your
emergency contacts and there you have it
folks nougat in a nutshell now we just
need manufacturers to jump on updates
while we await the next batch of Nexus
phones and the LGV 20 as the first
smartphones to launch with this new
operating system those of you on Nexus
devices what do you think of the updates
