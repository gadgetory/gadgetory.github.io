pocket now calm and this is a look at
the hardware on the samsung omnia pro be
7610 an easy way to think about this
device is like an omnia two but with the
slide out keyboard so those of you that
like the omnia too because of the AMOLED
screen and the interface will especially
like this device because this adds a
slide-out keyboard then positions it
well with the HTC touch pro2 so let's
talk specs for a minute before we
actually look at the hardware the device
is running in the 800 megahertz
processor which is faster than the touch
pro 2 is 528 megahertz processor it has
256 megabytes of ram 512 megabytes of
rom but you can expand that with microsd
it also has an FM radio it ad has divx
certification which is cool Wi-Fi and
bluetooth of course it has a gps FM
radio and some other goodies like TV out
and it has a proximity sensor things
that will cover in the rest of this
video so let's take a look at the
hardware of the device it looks so quite
a bit different than the omnia two but
if you actually look down here these
bottom buttons you you kind of get that
omnia too reminiscent feel the screen is
3.5 inches diagonal which is a little
bit smaller than the touch pro 2 is
actually the same size as the iphone the
resolution is wvga so that's 800 down
and 480 across let's zoom in to the top
a little bit and see what we have up
here this is where you'll find the light
sensor the proximity sensor and the
front-facing video camera if your
country supports it the flush screen the
touch screen is flush and it's resistive
not capacitive but of course the only
capacitive touch when his mobile device
out there right now is the hd2 going
down here we only have two buttons call
end and call starting if you tap and
hold this button it will turn off the
device here is a nice program
programmable hardware key which is very
convenient because you can have an open
email or internet or anything that you
want a lot of newer windows mobile
devices don't have the program will
hardware keys like the older devices did
and we really missed that I should note
that this device is a quad-band GSM
phone and dual band for UMTS
you will not be able to get 3g in the US
although this device is not really
intended for the US it's intended for
Europe but we find it strange that the
omnia two did support us 3g and yet the
omnia pro be 7610 does not very strange
we're wondering if it's coming to the
u.s. in May it may not we're not sure
yet we haven't heard any rumors will let
you know if we do so let's go to the
side and see what we have here let's
zoom in a little bit closer so here's a
volume rocker and we also have a W&amp;amp;L
button which stands for work and life
the idea is that you can switch modes
between a works home screen and a life
home screen not sure the concept really
makes that much sense but perhaps if
you're a professional and you like to
really separate your your work life and
your home life by having email on one
and weather on the other or something
like that then maybe it makes sense
going over to the right we have the
lanyard loop on the bottom we have
nothing but a microphone and also a
little fingernail slit to put your
finger in to open up the back battery
cover on the other side we have a camera
button a dual action camera button for
the 5 megapixel camera over here is a
lock button which will turn on and off
the device from standby and here's a
soft reset hold nicely placed we have a
collapsible stylist although it
collapses a few too many times it's
somewhat flimsy stylists and it's
interesting to see that the omnia be 76
10 includes the stylist or is the omnia
two had no stylus unless you wanted it
to dangle from your phone going up to
the top we have some ports up here we
have over here micro SD for charging and
syncing and to the right of that we've
3.5 millimeter for audio which is good
and let's flip over to the back if you
saw the unboxing you saw this fantastic
back battery covering and it's kind of a
glossy red shiny sort of like a candy
apple red coating actually and if you
kind of move it in the light you can see
these lines appear they're very nice so
up here we have a 5 megapixel camera
with a flash which is nice and down here
is the speaker let's take off the back
battery cover and see what we have
underneath of that solar here we have
the 1500 milliamp hour battery the sim
card
behind that and you put the micro SD
card up here unfortunately it's behind
the battery cover the back battery cover
is completely plastic I've been spoiled
recently by the metal backing of the HTC
hd2 in fact the most of the materials
used on the omnia pro are plastic so it
feels a little bit cheap in hand it has
enough weight to where it feels
substantial and it doesn't feel like
it's going to break if you use it let's
take a look at the slide out keyboard
which is spring assisted so far the
keyboard has been fantastic it's the
same width as the HTC touch pro2 and
because there are fewer keys on on the
keyboard panel all of the keys are a
little bit bigger and so if you look
closely they're raised ever so slightly
there they're close to being flat but
they have just enough depth to them to
where you can feel for them when you're
typing you get no dedicated number row
at the top these are the numbers are
kind of embedded into the letter so if
you want to get to a three f to press
off and three not that big of a deal so
a pretty nice keyword we have the d-pad
down here which is useful if you're
trying to get around without having to
move your thumbs up to touch the screen
like so so that was a look at the
hardware on the omnia pro be 7610 in
hand it feels a lot smaller than the
touch pro 2 probably because it's not as
tall wide and it's a little smaller in
terms of depth that said it feels a
little lower quality because i think the
materials used are mostly plastic versus
other devices which have kind of a
combination of materials some some metal
and some plastic and a little bit of
different kind of textures to make it
feel higher-quality the omnia two really
doesn't have that it's just one big
fingerprint fingerprint magnet all over
the device coming up soon we're going to
take a look at the interface on the
omnia pro be 7610 be sure to follow us
on twitter to know exactly when the next
video hits twitter.com slash pocket now
tweets we'll be back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
