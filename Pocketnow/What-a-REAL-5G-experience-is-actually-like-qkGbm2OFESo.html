crazy so you see that 5ge indicator yeah
that is not real 5g right now if you
want to try the real deal you have to
come to either Chicago or Minneapolis
try out the verizon network and get
yourself a Samsung Galaxy S 10 5g I'm
home it'll be better with pocket now and
we're here we're actually going to test
the real deal and we are really excited
let me tell you more about the
differences between what's real and
what's not
it is 9:45 in the morning we are
currently here in a Verizon store with
our first experience with the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 5g this is my first
experience with this phone actually
aside from the hands-on that we had in
Barcelona I really really like this
color obviously there is a lot more to
go through so let's begin with the
basics we just ran our first test within
the store obviously there is a 5g
antenna over up there at that corner so
we are getting 5g connectivity here you
have to look for the 5g UWB that is how
you know that you have true 5g and not
what other companies are saying that
they have thing about it is we've got
some insane speeds to start but the real
test is to go outside and see what this
phone can do in the real world so let's
go
SAP's first test that you saw here in
Chicago was a brush at Walton definitely
significant differences between the real
5g and 5g he and I do understand why
certain companies are using the moniker
right now 5g depends in part on 4G LTE
to work actually the upload speeds that
you see on Verizon are still on 4G LTE
as the service continues to get deployed
it takes time for example beamforming is
one of those things that's still a work
in progress right now but definitely you
can totally notice the difference
between one and the other what self site
number two between superior and Wallace
and yes speeds here were not as great as
the first test obviously so many
elements in the environment influenced
speeds one of them being line of sight
with 5g it's actually not the best idea
stand directly below a cell tower line
of sight can be achieved further and
let's continue testing see if we get
better results going forward we're
currently here in Franklin and grin
below the l-train quite an iconic area
in Chicago I love the rust in this
contraption that you've got here we ran
a couple of tests right now we got more
than 800 down in the first test second
one was 500 ish you've kind of noticed
that depending on where you go you can
lose the 5g connection very quickly but
then it immediately falls back into it
at some point I've noticed it's very
dynamic and jumping between connections
so far so good I guess an interesting
test for references to see what the
Galaxy S 1050 could do when compared to
the galaxy s 10 plus on Verizon and when
compared to the 1 plus 7 bro which my
unit was actually whitelisted on Verizon
to be able to conduct this test and
obviously 4G LTE speeds are already
crazy above the 200 megabits here but we
were able to get up to 900 sadly that
last test on 900 was not on camera
you've got to only see part of it but
yeah truly upload speeds are comparable
because again we're using four glt for
the upload link but then 5g download
speeds are significantly significantly
faster crazy and it finally happened we
are here between Grand and New Orleans
Street there's a small side tower up
there we've got really good
line-of-sight and we did get above 1
gigabit 1.25 five to be exact
16 uplink this is fantastic
obviously we have to test what the
experience is like downloading content
downloading videos and that's more of
what we're going to do let's continue
you know it's funny growing up I wanted
to come to the tallest building in the
world at the time which was the Sears
Tower which is no longer called that now
it's called the Willis Tower we're here
running another test there are actually
two separate notes here and another gig
we actually got 1.2 1:9 upload speeds
weren't necessarily that great the other
two tests that we conducted work below
the gig but still appear in the street
you get good line-of-sight you get
really crazy speed so far so good
and yes we conduct the testing over
downloading videos on Netflix
downloading movies on prime video
sometimes it really depends you've got a
good 5g connection here but then
probably the offering and speeds for
download from the company is not
necessarily the best which is what I've
noticed for Netflix if you move over to
prime video which uses 8 WS I didn't
notice significantly faster download
speeds same thing if I downloaded an app
from the Google Play Store it wasn't as
fast as if I use the Samsung store which
also uses AWS the results were kind of
crazy I mean I downloaded a three
gigabyte file in less than 45 seconds
why should you care I mean think about
how many times you've been trying to get
on a plane and you're on a rush it
happens to me all the time and you're
gonna lose connectivity you could just
download whatever video you want before
you get on the flight for me that's
awesome if you could do that in 45
seconds
that's insane so yeah testing is quite
positive yes believe it or not we are at
the top of the Willis Tower not exactly
sure if this was in my bucket list or
not but fine let's add it sure there are
no 5g speeds but we did have a chance to
try some photography with the galaxy s
10 5g and the experience has been really
real
I just I just saw the aperture go my
focus video let's see how to fix you up
okay it's actually good so anybody
remember my best friend's wedding
because if you do this is Chicago River
this is where it was filmed not exactly
sure if this is the same ferry but it is
beautiful we had some time for more
photography some video recording the
experience Chicago you know I'm I'm
impressed I never thought that I would
be like wow this is a beautiful city but
it is and definitely the testing on this
phone has been fantastic obviously there
is a little added extra functionality
with the camera we've got a lot a couple
of samples you could check out so far
the experience with the galaxy s 10 5 g
and Verizon's real 5g has been much
better than I expected like
significantly better experience it's
great you should definitely check it out
so that has been it for our experience
testing the Samsung Galaxy S 10 5g on
Verizon in Chicago the experience was
better than I expected there have been
numerous tests by other publications
over the last couple of weeks some of
these at the beginning were not as good
as they are now which proves that it is
a work in progress and they have been
moving quickly there are so many more
destinations so many more cities planned
for 2019 I would really like to know
what you guys think in the comments down
below would you adopt 5g now are you
going to wait it out in my case honestly
the Galaxy S n 5g is for me like it's a
marvel of engineering how they fit those
RF antennas to be able to provide
millimeter wave in addition to sub six I
think that it's a really good phone on
its own and the fact that its future
proof makes it even better but that's my
opinion obviously we would love to know
what you think in the comments and while
you're at it follow us on social media
subscribe to both of our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one and also follow me on my
personal handles in case you want to see
some weird running photos obviously
follow us on instagram as our extended
coverage happens there please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I'm happy that I think so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
