s7 will be second to none Android 61
marshmallow already tipped to have some
important changes for 2016 and some
major deals make it important for you to
visit amazon ASAP I'm high in metairie
vetta and just to ensure that you guys
get a video today I actually decided to
record it a day early this is parking
out daily you know we're going to start
the official news as much as we can with
deals as there are a ton for the holiday
season and we start with the Moto X pier
edition those of you interested in this
phone hey the 32 gig bearing is
currently for 350 bucks on amazon
meaning it's cheaper than the 16 gig
variant in addition to that if you want
the long way watch you also get the
option to get an amazon or best buy for
a very good price as well but it depends
on the Bering you want so links in
description as we get more details there
and now we start with rumors as those of
you that were all stoked about the HTC
One X 9 it seems that the phone will be
gorgeous i mean the design was really
nice up to the point where we've got
more photos showing you exactly what to
expect here and there is a lot this
design clearly is of a premium phone but
I'd call it more of a premium mid-range
as the leaked specifications point it
more to a product that's not going to be
costing much and then we've got some
leaks on the price tag and apparently it
won't be more expensive than three
hundred dollars which is actually not
bad at all and for those of you that are
in the market currently with a Windows
Phone 8.1 device waiting for your
windows 10 mobile update it's not going
to happen in December we've got official
news that it's now going to happen early
in 2016 and this is a big problem with
Microsoft this company rarely ever meets
its deadlines and then the launches are
just not that great as well as you can
learn about our Lumia 950 review when it
comes to windows 10 mobile so it's
probably a good thing that you'll have
to wait it's just sad that you have to
and then moving the spotlight over to
Android 6 thought one it seems that it
will be called marshmallow and it seems
that it will be launched in June which
is rather interesting as this is usually
the time when we've got you know a newer
version of Android already being
announced we even have new
is that Google might be conducting
surveys for what name we want for
Android n as there are many pastries
options as start with an end but then
again it seems that Android six dot one
will bring split-screen multitasking and
display we just don't know exactly what
products will be supported we don't know
if this is a tablet exclusive or it will
also work on phones will keep you posted
and finally the very hot news today
return to the Galaxy s7 we've got some
very credible sources claiming that the
hardware won't change much apparently
Samsung is focusing everything on
TouchWiz the company wants to figure out
a way to make this the most fluid
experience you've ever had on a
smartphone and that is apparently going
to be the selling point we might get
hardware that looks identical to the
current one which is not necessarily a
bad thing but hey it leads me to the
question of the day how do you think
that touch was could differentiate
itself from the fluid experiences they
also already get from you know stock
Android on Android M for example in my
case I feel that if Samsung is able to
pull off the things that it currently
does on TouchWiz just in a better more
efficient way more effective way than I
think they've got a good product there
but leave us a comment down below like
