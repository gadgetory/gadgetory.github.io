garnered ZTE lots of positive reputation
for 2016 but the company is out for more
i'm hi meri better with pocket now he
ready for 2016 with the ZTE axon 7 mini
all of PocketNow Ziva 2016 coverage is
brought to you by XCOM global
it seems that companies really haven't
gotten the memo as to what many accounts
for considering that the Exxon seven
mini is really just 0.3 inches smaller
than the Exxon 7 but there's really more
to the story in fact we should actually
consider that the new Exxon 7 Mini is
more of that premium mid-range err that
we originally believed the Exxon 7 was
instead of following the flagship trend
of the larger sibling the Exxon 7 mini
packs of snapdragon 617 processor 3 gigs
of ram and 32 gigs of expandable storage
dual-sim capabilities are still here the
camera is of 16 megapixels matched by 8
megapixels in the selfie shooter the
battery obviously got smaller at 2705
milliamp hours and we now have a 5.2
inch 1080p display now even though
specifications don't really spell
flagship this phone is just as gorgeous
as the larger variant supporting the
same arc design and one of the best
metallic builds we've seen this year in
addition to a great pair of front firing
speakers
like the Exxon 7 these aren't just any
set of speakers as they follow on the
same theater like Dolby Surround HiFi
sound that we receive with the Exxon 7
up to the point where if you remember
Juan's recent review of it we're talking
about pretty much the loudest sound in
the mobile industry we're also not
surprised to see the ZTS user interfaces
just display it as on the Exxon 7 even
though these devices here on the demo
area are not really final about the only
way you can tell the Exxon 7 Mini apart
from its larger sibling is because
there's this minor texture over the
speakers and the mini is a tad less wide
and tall than the Exxon 7 and everything
else the look and feel comes standard
which is actually stating a lot of
positives here
if you're wondering exactly why there is
a need for an exon 7 mini that 299 gyro
price tag probably says a lot as you're
paying very little money for a lot with
this phone whether this is a worthy
premium mid ranger is still up for grabs
but our full review should follow up
very soon instead of paying horrible
roaming fees when traveling abroad or
the hassle of buying another sim why not
try a smarter solution XCOM global gives
you unlimited internet connectivity

seven dollars and 77 cents a day follow
