pocket now calm today Apple announced
the ipad mini oh and they announced a
new iPad for that we really didn't
expect in this video we're going to
cover some first impressions let's get
to it so first I should start off by
saying that Apple can no longer keep
secrets the ipad mini we saw this device
months and months before its
announcement today even back to the
iphone 5 we saw that months and months
previous to that devices announcement
even the ipad 3 early in the earlier
this year we saw leaked many months
prior to its announcement so the ipad 4
was a little bit of a surprise we
expected potentially a refreshed ipad 3
with a lightning port but we did not
expect it to have an upgraded a much
upgraded a6x cpu and to be honest the
ipad 3 does have some lags and some
glitches that causes it to feel a little
bit slow at times if you have an ipad 3
you know what i'm talking about as
usually great performance but sometimes
when you're playing in a high FPS game
or you're flipping through a very image
heavy website it does get bogged down a
little bit so the inclusion of the a6x
chip whatever that is i'm assuming that
it's an a6 chip but better maybe with
more GPU cores will be fantastic also
with the ipad for which they're not
calling the ipad for it's just again the
new ipad there's faster Wi-Fi which is
always good there's also a higher
resolution front-facing camera if anyone
actually uses FaceTime I know I really
don't and it's also got LTE on more
carriers like sprint here in the US so
the ipad 4 definitely a welcomed
addition it's still going to be think
it's still going to be heavy just like
the original ipad and it comes in at the
same price as the ipad 3 and that will
be pre up for pre-order on Friday on the
twenty-sixth of October and it will be
shipping a week after that and then two
weeks after that the cellular ipad 4
starts shipping and then the ipad mini
was announced and there are some
disappointing parts of the ipad mini but
overall the ipad mini is going to be a
smash hit because literally it takes
everything that's good about the ipad
the awesome apps the fantastic
6p the performance the form factor and
makes it smaller so supposedly you can
hold it with one hand I was very
disappointed that the screen resolution
is only 1024 x 768 the Nexus 7 has a
higher screen resolution at 1280 by 800
so does many other tablets out there
that run Android at the smaller screen
size because at 1024 x 768 you only get
160 to PPI resolution and that's not
really that great but again I think the
fact that the iPad Mini is so thin and
so light it's only seven point two
millimeters thick it's going to make it
an awesome device you're going to be
able to get it in a bag and put it in
the pocket and really experience all of
those cool things that you like about
the ipad just on the go and in a more
compact form also the design of the ipad
mini looks awesome inspired by the
iphone 5 it's got that beveled edge
around the perimeter which hopefully
doesn't scratch as easily as the iphone
5 we've got a aluminum backing just like
the ipad and and the iphone 5 of course
and hopefully again that doesn't scratch
so easily it's available in black and
white and the black one looks just
awesome i should say hopefully it's not
a fingerprint magnet another cool thing
about the ipad mini is that it starts at
just three hundred and twenty nine bucks
of course you can get a nexus 7 4 199
bucks but probably if you're looking at
an ipad mini you're not the kind of
person that also would like an Android
tablet and the reverse is true as well
the ipad mini you know it's going to be
a great tablet but it's going to be
locked in to what Apple wants you to do
you're not going to be able to change it
very much because it runs iOS just like
every single iOS device so if you're
okay with that you'll like the ipad mini
but if you want the freedom and
flexibility that only android can
provide then the nexus 7 is still a
fantastic choice so overall personally i
can't wait for the ipad mini i'm tired
of the thick and heavy weight of the
ipad 3 and the ipad 4 is going to be the
same story Apple did what they needed to
do their opening the market even more
now they're competing with smaller
tablets but of course the Android camp
doesn't sit still and Google knows this
and in 2013 and
said this about 2012 they're going to
get serious on in tablets because this
is a market that they have to compete in
and now with the smaller iPad the
pressure is on even more so what do you
think about the ipad mini and the ipad 4
are you going to get one or are you
going to stick with android or are you
not even convinced that tablets are for
you well i'm a tablet lumber it says so
in my twitter profile so i can't wait
for both of these new to these two new
tablets so if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
