today it's referring to the HTC One
of course the answer could have been
easier or harder depending on whether
HTC would have decided to give us
additional color options but now they
kept it classic conservative black and
white I'm Anton this is PocketNow
and here watching HTC One color options
compared let's check them out now I
decided to start this video by showing
you the back of these phones and by
showing you that right now
the black one has no fingerprints I did
my best to wipe it off and we'll see how
it attracts and how it displays
fingerprints after I handle the film and
the same thing is valid for the silver /
white version of the HTC One it is shiny
new both on the back and on the front
you can see there are no fingerprints
right now so let's lay them down and
start to handle these two and hopefully
you'll get a sense of how they collect
fingerprints now it's a no-brainer we
have a black HTC One on the left and the
white HTC One on the right the black one
is really black it's not like the iPhone
5 we're in different lighting conditions
it might display dark blue and the white
one is not white it's actually silver
aka the natural color of aluminum and
both phones have plastic inserts the
silver one has a white plastic insert
above the camera and below the HTC beats
branding while the black one has black
plastic inserts on the top and right on
the bottom and we're starting to collect
fingerprints now taking a look on the
side we have volume rockers which on the
black one are black and they are silver
on the white one going on to the top the
power buttons are both black and that's
because HTC has managed to hide an IR
blaster behind the button itself
flipping them to the other side will see
the Micro SIM card slot and of course
the color is the same now above the
edges all the way to the top and go
all the way around you'll see some
plastic inserts and it might remind you
of the HTC Droid DNA those phones had
red inserts now this is white on the
white and it's black on the black H tc1
now taking a closer look at the top
let's see if we can try to zoom in and
still maintain focus you'll see that the
speakers which are part of the boom
sound experience so the top speakers are
grilled and the holes are really neat
there's no problem there and the same
applies for for the bottom of the film
you can see them right here they're very
very well executed let's wipe enough and
of course the HTC logo on the middle
which is not a button unfortunately even
though some hacks suggest that it might
actually work as a bikini back and home
buttons on the bottom now flipping them
to the back there's absolutely no
difference we have the cameras on the
top and the Beats Audio branding on the
bottom now I'm handling these phones
right now and I'm touching them and I'm
using them like I would normally use and
let's see how they hold up as you can
see the HTC One on the right which is
the black one starts to exhibit some
nasty fingerprints while the white one
is hiding them concealing them very very
well going on to the front now is
something which I've seen on the HTC One
the HTC One manages to deter finger
prints really really well so if you use
the phone like you would use any other
phone in my experience the HTC One
collects less fingerprints on the front
glass than other phones now due to the
great design of the HTC One both of
these phones are looking good which one
should you get well if you don't mind
the fingerprints on the back which
believe me are quite difficult to get
rid of then by all means go with the
black one it is elegant it looks good
from a distance it looks good in the
hand if you would prefer a light color
one which manages to conceal your
fingerprints it's easier to clean on the
back and it's trendy then you should go
with the silver
now talking a little bit about the
design you will see that both of these
phones while made out of aluminum and
let me put them like this maybe I'll try
to get some focus here
they had this chamfered edge right here
and the glass kind of follows the
contour all the way to the bottom and as
you can see right here it goes round and
round and it's also present on the back
and the black one is not different at
all you can see it right there the the
glass follows the contours and the goes
all the way to the back and the front
and round and round we've seen this on
the iPhone 5 before now there's a
problem with the iPhone 5 the chamfered
edge once you drop it or you scratch it
it will get some nasty dents now whether
this is the question also with the HTC
One it is too early to tell we've been
using these phones for less than a week
and we've been kind of gentle and so far
we've seen no scratches on them either
on the front nor on the back but as
usual with an aluminum which is anodized
and it's getting a color other than its
natural color there are also always
chances of chipping them so the safe
option would be to go with the white one
however if you are like me and you take
good care of your phones maybe you throw
in a case which I hate then you can go
with the black one my iPhone 5 has been
holding up very well I had both the
white and the black just like with the
HTC One and I'm sure if you take good
care of your phone you don't drop it
then it will serve you very well and it
will look exactly like in day one even
after a long period of time and at the
end just a quick design cue let's see if
we can get a real close focus right here
on these buttons I'm not sure my camera
is able to pick that up there's a
texture on this button and it's a
circular texture let me try to do my
best and zoom in and see if we can get
some focus right there we got it for a
second and maybe you can see it here if
looks nice and it's exactly the same on
the black one too so this is nice we
like the overall design and we like what
HTC did with d1 now that we've seen the
differences between the white and the
black HTC one I encourage you to follow
the link in the description you're gonna
land on pocketnow.com an editorial of
mine where I choose my personal favorite
between the black and the white HTC one
but only do that after you follow us on
all the usual channels you know exactly
where to find us
this has been Anton you've been watching
pocket now and I thank you very much for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
