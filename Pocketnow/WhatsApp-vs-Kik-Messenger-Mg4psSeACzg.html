Facebook announced it was buying what's
up for 19 billion dollars we compared
the popular messaging service with
Facebook's in-house messenger but how
does whatsapp compared with say kik
another very popular mobile messenger
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is whatsapp vs. cake right off the
bat both of these messengers have a
serious core difference what's up
requires a phone number that's how your
account is created and your context list
is managed by corresponding phone
numbers in your address book you don't
add friends by user name you don't
search for friends by email or first and
last name you add them to the contacts
list in your phone in other words if you
don't have their personal phone number
you can't talk to them and whatsapp kik
is the complete opposite anonymity is a
feature even though it may scan your
phone for existing contacts who are
already on kik you can also add users by
their username and you never have to
exchange phone numbers cake is sort of
like the new-age AOL Instant Messenger
or aim for smartphones
whereas whatsapp is more like an SMS
replacement but the differences don't
end there neither do the feature sets in
whatsapp you can attach pictures videos
audio location and contacts to messages
nothing terribly mind-blowing there
however you can also have a back and
forth voice chat if text simply isn't
conveying enough emotion you gets in and
read receipts inline media and the
ability to set wallpapers and customize
the font size with kik the customization
options are limited to changing the chat
bubble colors but you get Sint delivered
and Rev recedes and the attachment types
are definitely more open-ended this is
enabled through one of kiks standout
features an integrated browser right
from within kik you can search and
browse the web as cool as that may seem
the actual integrated browser isn't as
nice as it may sound it's fully
functioning but you'd probably be better
off switching to a dedicated browser for
any serious browsing or searching the
true utility of the integrated browser
however comes with third-party plug-in
style functionality through kik
optimized sites you get integrated memes
the ability to send videos without a
time limit YouTube videos Reddit and
even games we're not certain it's as
innovative as cake would have us believe
but it's definitely
worth noting it certainly provides more
unique experience it makes cake feel
more like a digital lounge and strictly
another chat app also worth noting is
that both services come with file size
limits 12 megabytes for whatsapp and 10
megabytes for kick though through some
third-party sites you may be able to
circumvent that limit and kick both also
have group messaging which allows you to
send pictures and other media to
multiple people at once though we like
whatsapp's group messaging a little
better
what about cross device support actually
neither service offers it and neither
can be accessed from the web or desktop
they're both strictly mobile and if you
log in the cake on two different devices
you will only stay signed into the
device you logged into last and your
messages will not be synced across
devices whatsapp is sort of the same way
but at the very least you can export and
email your conversations for safekeeping
finally pricing whatsapp is free for the
first year but each additional year will
cost you 99 cents not too bad kit is
completely free unless you're into
paying a dollar or two for stickers here
and there at the end of the day both of
these apps though quite different will
get the job done just the same
they're both feature packed messaging
services which have a lot to offer and
giant user bases still whatsapp is
definitely the more mature serious
service and depending on your preference
that may be a good or bad thing tick on
the other hand comes with an air of
youthfulness with its extra web-based
plugins stickers and user names instead
of phone numbers on the flip side that
particular feature gives kik a unique
advantage the ability to chat and get to
know someone without sharing your
private mobile number this is helpful
when meeting people online especially if
you don't want to get too personal
