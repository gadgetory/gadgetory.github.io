maybe we can help you we have the hot
Sony Xperia z1 and we have the already
classic HTC one let's take a look how
these to compare in this video right now
if hyper glaze plastic is not your thing
how about we compare an aluminum phone
this time with a device made of glass
regardless of where you stand after
comparing the Xperia z1 to the Samsung
Galaxy s4 we are now looking at the Sony
flagship side-by-side with HTC's one of
course there's no waterproofing and
desperate thing on the one as you'll
find on the Xperia z1 but it is our
belief shared by many others that the
one is a tough phone to be at least in
the design materials and in hand feel
Department yes the HTC One is another
phone that needs no introduction
it was and still is one of androids most
beautifully designed and executed models
and as our after the buzz episode
testifies it is also a phone which has
aged pretty well it is HTC's best phone
yet period
we'll compare these two today and we'll
analyze as usual hardware software and
user experience as well as the camera
aluminium and glass are coming to both
of these devices however the amount used
of each is different while the Sony
Xperia z1 uses a single piece aluminum
frame construction sandwiched between
two layers of tempered glass the HTC one
only has the glass in the front the rest
being aluminum held together by Olli
carbonate frame and its inserts
one of the things we saluted and
applauded HTC 4 was the exceptional feel
in the hand as far as the HTC One was
concerned that was mainly because of the
slightly curved back which filled the
palm of your hand
coupled with the cold to the touch
aluminum and that many phones can offer
such a great sensorial reward
however the Xperia z1 manages to match
that simply but just like the one the
Xperia z1 screens premium from the
second you lay your eyes and hands on it
it might not have a curved back and it
is definitely taller and wider but it is
a pleasure to hold and very difficult to
let go of couple that with its IP 57 and
IP fifty-eight ratings which allows
submersion beyond one and a half meters
of fresh water as well as the sprue
thing and you get one hell of an
irresistible sexy phone the Xperia z1
manages to achieve
that well-being 37 grams heavier than
the one at 170 grams it is also 66
millimetres taller than the one at 144
versus 137 point four millimeters on the
inside these two couldn't be any more
different the Xperia z1 is powered by
two points to do Hertz quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor the
HTC One has a 1.71 Hertz Snapdragon 600
at its core Ram is at i/o two gigabytes
on both devices internal storage wise
the Xperia z1 only has 16 gigabytes
onboard expandable via microSD while the
one has 32 and 64 gigabyte options both
of which are sadly non expandable while
the resolution is full HD on both of
these at 1920 by 1080 resolution Sony
uses a 5-inch panel and HTC opted for a
4.7 inch screen technologies are also
different
there is a TFT display on the Sony phone
with the company's own triluminos
technology from TVs together with x-ray
LT engine there is a Super LCD 3 unit on
HTC's flagship and it also has a higher
ppi rating at 468 versus 441 not that it
would matter anywhere else but on paper
while the screen on the Xperia z1 is an
improvement over the screen of the
Xperia Z it does not manage to equal the
screen of the HTC One HTC Super LCD 3
screen manages to have excellent color
reproduction great brightness vivid
color saturation and almost Super AMOLED
like blacks the screen and the z1 is
good but not that good
it also has a problem just like with
previous Sony phones viewing angles if
you look at the screen that on that
Center you will see a clear crisp image
with colors which are vibrant enough so
that you can be satisfied tilt it to the
sides and you will start losing
sharpness tilted even more and you will
start seeing only whites with washed off
colors sadly the screen on the z1 is
still not that good it is good but not
as good as the one on the HTC one also
on paper the 20.7 megapixel stabilized
camera on the z1 destroys the 4
megapixel ultrapixel camera on the one
if you look at sheer numbers we'll see
how they actually compare later on in
this video
sony needed to fit a larger battery on
the z1 to power every
we're looking at 3000 milliamp hours on
the Xperia z1 versus 2300 milliamp hours
and the one sadly neither of the two are
user removable or accessible and then
there are the HTC one pros it has an
infrared port on top which you can use
as a remote control if you want which is
not present on the Xperia z1 we also
need to mention boomsound HTC's front
firing dual speakers for which the Z
ones bottom mounted unit is really no
match Android 4.2.2 jelly bean operates
on both of these devices and both
platforms have custom user interfaces on
top of them we'd say the playground is
level but still there are many
differences especially when it comes to
sense 5 on the HTC One which we've
really grown to like it is a
minimalistic skin on top of Android
which doesn't bug it down and sure looks
good look feet is there to make the this
authorising topic on whether people like
it or not but those who do have easy
access to most of their social media and
news feeds since 5:00 on the 1 retains
nothing from the stock Android
experience or very little which is
negligible however it does so in an
elegant way Sony's own UI is more
conservative and we have to tell you we
like the app tray on the z1 more than on
the one mainly because of its horizontal
scrolling and lack of clock and weather
at the top needless to say they both
deliver a great Android experience
however the one wins when it comes to
the notification shade you can swipe it
down with one or two fingers depending
on what you want which is more intuitive
than what you'll find on the z1 which
you can only sweat down in a single way
with a single finger the HTC One has
been known for its snappiness
it is still super snappy as we told you
it is ageing well but for those among
you for whom milliseconds matter will
tell you that the z1 is even snappier
the Snapdragon 800 makes a difference
even if not a huge one in day-to-day
test launching applications is most of
the times faster on the z1 not by a lot
but enough so that your Facebook feed is
displayed less than a second faster than
it would on the one if you're a person
that cares about such things the z1 is
the winner here in terms of features we
are on a more level playing on than we
were with the occasion of our z1 vs s
for comparison software-wise the z1
features small app capabilities which
are windowed apps look running and
floating on top or everything else
whether you use
this or not is up to you but it's there
on the z1 and that's another point for
the Sonia device browser calculator
calendar notes recorder and a few others
for an in-depth look at the HTC one's
features make sure to check out our full
dedicated tour of everything present on
this device as far as the z1 is
concerned you can choose a theme among
the existing eight which will not only
change your wallpapers but it also
affect the overall accent of the phone
if your household has several other Sony
products it will be very easy for you to
mirror content from these periods you
want the keyboard is also something you
can customize your own liking
including the layout as well as the
theme the optimum location has Picasa
Flickr Facebook and Sony PlayMemories
integration while the Walkman
application will handle all your
streaming and local music playback needs
if you want to tweak your photos there's
an Autodesk application pre-installed
called Pixlr Express
there are also Sony's own apps to
identify music and videos but sadly the
video bit alongside other applications
are not available in our region talking
about stills let's take a look at the
camera performance will play the samples
for you while we tell you that choosing
between the two is not so tricky this
time they both have their strong and
weak points though if this comparison
would only refer to specs alone the Z
120 point 7 megapixel camera would be
the clear winner against the 4 megapixel
camera on the one however there's more
to the story in bright sunny outdoors
which we consider perfect lighting the
one exhibits more noise than the z1
which makes the z1 the winner in this
category despite the fact that itself
produces noisy images bring them indoors
and kill the light and HTC's ultra pixel
camera has a hard time coping with the
lack of illumination the z1 snaps a
picture without a problem even if the
details are something you can't forget
about and when the flash is turned on it
also produces clearer images with more
detail in terms of video the z1 is
focusing as well as metering much faster
than the one it also adapts faster as
you will see in the upcoming samples
does he want clearly offers a better
video recording output than the one but
that's our opinion look and judge for
yourself
hey everyone is this Tony from pocket
now and this time it's the Sony Xperia
z1 or z2 on compared to the HD
see one-to-ones here and we'll see what
are the 20.7 megapixel shooter on the
Xperia z1 is any good compared to the 4
megapixel ultrapixel camera on the HTC
One the scene is the same conditions are
the same as in with the case of our z1
vs. galaxy s4 comparison and we're gonna
try to do things in that exact same
order come against the Sun and then go
in here for a close-up on these leaves
stay for a couple of seconds just for
autofocus to do its thing on the screen
of the z1 it looks like the z1 is
struggling a bit and then let's move in
for another focus here a close-up on
this flower and we'll stay there for
focus as well as exposure and then
circle back to where we started from the
church thank you very much for watching
this was anthem front pocket now hey
everyone this is Tony from pocket now
and this time it's the Sony Xperia z1 or
z2 on compared to the HTC One 2 ones
here and we'll see what are the 20.7
megapixel shooter on the Xperia z1 is
any good compared to the 4 megapixel
ultrapixel camera on the HTC one the
scene is the same conditions are the
same as in with the case of our c1 vs
galaxy s4 comparison and we're gonna try
to do things in that exact same order
come against the Sun and then go in here
for a close-up on these leaves stay for
a couple of seconds just for autofocus
to do its thing on the screen of the z1
it looks like the z1 is struggling a bit
and then let's move in for another focus
here
a close-up on this flower and will stay
there for focus as well as exposure and
then circle back to where we started
from the church thank you very much for
watching this was anthem from pocket now
to wrap everything up we're looking at a
fresh phone versus a six month old
device even at the flagship there is a
slight difference between the two in
terms of performance but when it comes
to the camera the z1 is better when it
comes to the overall experience
we who like cents tend to give it to HTC
but your tastes can vary in terms of
build quality materials and then hand
feel the z1 is as close as it can ever
get to HTC's one my now famous execution
factoring all of the aforementioned
in we hope we've made it easier for you
to pick your phone and if you also need
it to be water and dust proof it's
really no comparison folks that's it for
today
thank you very much for watching this
was the Sony Xperia z1 vs. HTC one

forget you can follow and you should
