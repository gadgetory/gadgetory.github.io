pocket now calm back in 2010 I like many
others got the original iPad I was
excited about the idea of having a new
way to consume content not a netbook not
a laptop but a slate like device and
slates aren't necessarily new but in
this case a slate like device that could
allow me to access all kinds of great
content movies books email in a whole
new kind of way the problem is that the
original iPad and the ipad 2 and every
other tablet that's out there right now
fails on one important front it fails to
meet the quality that you get when you
look at a printed newspaper or printed
magazine you can see pixels on the
screen it feels digital it doesn't feel
like you've picked up a magazine from
the newsstand in fact I remember back in
2010 I would spend hours using the iPad
to the point of ice train and the ice
train came about because i was looking
at these kind of big pixels actually
very low resolution screen on the
original ipad now with the new ipad and
with tablets coming out in 2012 from
samsung from asus and a lot of other
companies we're going to see high
resolution displays that will finally
replicate successfully print quality in
a great form factor it's really going to
change the way we consume content
finally so we're going to unbox the new
ipad now so let's get to it
so if you're going to buy an iPad a new
iPad you have a lot of decisions to make
and that was the same case with the ipad
2 and even the first generation ipad
this time you can choose between 16 32
and 64 gigabytes you can also go with 4g
on either verizon or AT&amp;amp;T furthermore
you can choose black or white as you can
see over here i chose the verizon 4g 32
gigabyte white version and let me tell
you why number one color I like how
white deters fingerprints so white was
my choice number two capacity 64
gigabytes is a ton of space I don't need
that but 16 gigabytes is not enough
space if you want to be able to watch
several back to back HD movies on a
cross-country flight for example and
also if you're downloading lots of games
the retina display uses a ton of data so
apps are huge movies are huge and really
bumping up in space is a really good
idea and i went with verizon this time
previously i had the Wi-Fi 16 gigabyte
version verizon this time because
verizon's LTE network is very ubiquitous
or more so than 80 the big downside to
choosing verizon is that the fallback
the 3g evdo is far slower than the fall
back for AT&amp;amp;T so it matters whether you
live in an area with AT&amp;amp;T LTE that would
have been my first choice but just
because verizon has about a year head
start on AT&amp;amp;T I went with verizon so I
could get as much l2 is I possibly can
and hopefully I won't come across there
evdo very much because it's it's pretty
slow so let's unbox this and we're not
going to spend much time looking at
what's actually in the box we're gonna
spend some time looking closely at this
screen and comparing it a little bit to
the ipad 2 and then we've got a lot more
coverage coming up so here we go
handy-dandy tab here we're not going to
go into the box because you know what's
in there there's a charger in there and
take this off and you see if I can
notice a difference in terms of weight
it definitely feels a little bit heavier
than the ipad 2 it definitely feels a
little bit thicker here is the ipad 2 on
the left you really can't tell i mean
it's so insignificant it's about the
addition of a a coin
depth about one millimeter so it's not
that big of a deal I really want to
power this thing on and see what the
screen looks like finally so here it
goes turning on all right here we are
I'm gonna set this up and come back in a
few minutes and do some comparisons okay
so right now I'm zoomed zoomed in very
close to the calendar icon this is the
ipad to the previous ipad can you see
pixels let's see if we can get a little
bit closer in and without the camera
going out of focus you can see pixels
and i know you can see it even in this
video in 1080p so let's slide this off
the screen and get the new ipad out here
you cannot see pixels in most cases i
just spent a few minutes trying to
divine pixels and yes i actually was
able to see pixels in some areas but
when you're looking at this from a
normal viewing angle this screen is is
just hot i mean it is it is unbelievable
in terms of how it looks like it's not a
screen and it's it's great that we're
getting to that point in technology
where the technology is going away and
all we have is just as beautiful image
now so let's do a little bit more
comparison here so let's zoom out all
the way we're gonna bring both on the
screen you'll notice that my ipad 2 is
cracked i think it's correct because one
day i was so angry at the low res
display that I threw a rock into it just
kidding I didn't do that so I watched so
far here and let's go to a website
interestingly interestingly the ipad to
launch the browser faster so we're going
to go to pocket now on both and we can
actually just hit that over there
out of the box the brightness is set a
little bit lower than probably most
people would like so let's zoom in here
extremely smooth extremely smooth a
little bit slower to clear up let's get
really close and try to see some pixels
on the ipad 2 you can absolutely see
pixels here with the w on the new ipad
you really can't tell that there are
actual little dots making up this screen
quite amazing let's go back to the home
screen gestures enabled yep so let's go
into the settings both cleared from
memory let's see which opens faster
interestingly again the iPad to beat the
ipad 3 in terms of speed there and it's
possible that it's because it's pulling
in some information setting up
synchronization on this guy here right
away what I'm noticing and by the way
this is a picture of a dog's eye not a
really hairy human what I'm noticing
brighter ways that the screen on the new
iPad is definitely warmer it's a little
bit more yellow screen on the ipad 2 is
cooler and you can't tell from this
video I know you're not going to be able
to tell because from about 3 feet away
it's hard for me to tell but the detail
is just so much greater here on the ipad
3 you can really see each individual
hair here well zoom in a little bit this
was a photo taken with an 8 megapixel
camera so it's perhaps not the best
quality in the world to show off and
here's another shot and again you get to
see the warmer color here on the ipad 3
now not sure if I'm the biggest fan of
that but certainly here with the detail
in the dog's nose you can see far more
detail on the ipad 3 it just looks a
little bit blurry here on the ipad 2
here's one more picture that I think
serves as a good example I've actually
bumped the brightness a little bit on
the ipad 3 so we're to zoom into the
coconut over on the ipad 2 and you can
kind of get a sense for the texture that
you'll see over there ok so we're
looking at the coconut on the ipad 2 you
can see each flake it's a little bit
soft around the edges in fact i'd say a
lot soft around the edges and let's look
at the ipad 3 same exact picture and
gosh you can just see smaller pieces of
the coconut more so than you can on the
ipad 2 so we're going to other
comparisons coming up with the new ipad
and
tablets out there even android tablets
so far I'm really impressed with the
quality of the screen obviously it's
exactly what you would think it is a
screen with a tremendous pixel density
lending to a display that looks like
it's painted on and I can't wait to load
on some apps play some games read a
newspaper and really start integrating
this into my life to see if it's
actually going to make a difference and
and most importantly if I don't get the
eye strain that I got with the ipad 2 in
the ipad 1 because of that low
resolution screen so if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and if
there's something in particular you
would like to see with the new ipad will
be happy to show it to you leave a
comment down below and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
