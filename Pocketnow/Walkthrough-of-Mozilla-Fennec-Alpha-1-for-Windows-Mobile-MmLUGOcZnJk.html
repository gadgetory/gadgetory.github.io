now calm and Mozilla just released the
newest version of the Alpha a fennec for
windows mobile that's their mobile web
browser that's trying to be kind of like
firefox on a mobile device and it's come
a really long way it's still not perfect
but let me go through what's changed and
what's different and I think you'll
actually be quite impressed with how
this is shaping up so let's get closer
in on the screen here we are on
amazon.com and of course you can move
your finger around to go around the page
where you can tap on links now with
fennec what you do to get to multiple
tabs as you swipe your finger to the
right then you get a tab menu here and
right now I have three different tabs
open if I tap on the second tab I will
be taken to Hulu and it doesn't appear
that this version of fennec will support
flash it says who the requires flash
player nine-point-oh or higher and if we
swipe again to the left we can quickly
close one of these tabs by just tapping
on them in the upper left corner or we
can add a new one by tapping the plus
button and typing in a web address now
speaking of typing in a web address when
you tap on the address bar and here we
go what you'll get is your recent
history in addition you'll get this
little bar along the bottom so that you
can search right from google and it's
kind of hard to see it's a little bit
buggy right now but you can go to
answers com if you swipe your finger to
the right you saw ebay down there
Wikipedia so this allows for really
quick access to a Google search our
Wikipedia search right from the address
bar so let's wipe back to the right and
go back to amazon now as we mentioned in
the previous video about fennec you can
actually view the security certificate
information about this brap about this
website just like you would on the
desktop version of Mozilla Firefox if we
want to add this to our favorites
there's a little tiny button over here
and we've already done that and here's
our bookmarks menu I've already am it
added amazon.com to this folder if we
tap on manage we get a more granular
view of our bookmarks we can close out
some
them if we want to delete a new folder
that I made earlier or you can make a
new folder completely put a bunch of
them into the same folder and go from
there now swiping to the right and its
really interesting how Mozilla has made
use of the limited space on a small
screen device swiping to the right will
bring out the forward and back button
although I think this should have been
placed up here somewhere plus the
favorite button and just like Firefox on
the desktop if you tap on the star a
filled-in star means that it's a
favorite but a hollow star means it's
not and down here we have the Settings
button so let's go into that now now by
far one of the coolest features that's
going to be in fennec when it's released
as a full version is the ability to add
on extensions if you're running firefox
you probably have multiple extensions
loaded that will customize the browsing
experience so for example imagine having
x marks which is a program that
synchronizes all your bookmarks and all
your passwords load it on your mobile
device so you could have your facebook
password your banking password anything
that you want to take with you right on
your device right now the plugins are
very limited in fact there are only four
under the recommended tab there's a
Twitter plug-in there's one for
scripting and one for fixing URLs if you
tap on search you get a search bar
though I've tried searching for certain
ones like like x marks for example so i
type x marks and it actually searches as
you type and you're going to see that it
comes up with no matches so i'm not sure
if mozilla has in mind that all of the
extensions on firefox desktop will be
available on the mobile version or only
if certain ones will be certified we'll
have to find out more about that later
so let's continue in the settings here
if we go to the down button or the down
arrow this is a download manager that
lets you sort by date site name and you
can actually search through them and
finally down here there's a little
Settings icon and this lets you change
certain settings let's zoom and I know
it's a really small on the screen you
can have it load images automatically
enable javascript javascript chasing
tracing you can turn on and off plugins
because sometimes it may slow down your
device privacy and security things about
passwords being saved and cookies and
private
data you can clear it from there if your
overall browsing experience is somewhat
clunky it's usable definitely but it's
not as refined as upper mobile 9.5 at
this point because this is an early
alpha release it'll be really
interesting to see with how Mozilla
continues to evolve fennec and we can't
wait for a full release and the ability
to have extensions and really bring that
Firefox like experience to a mobile
device and its really interesting how
they've held leave innovated on a mobile
device it's it's really different stuff
that we're happy to see so that's it for
fennec for more on this and for download
