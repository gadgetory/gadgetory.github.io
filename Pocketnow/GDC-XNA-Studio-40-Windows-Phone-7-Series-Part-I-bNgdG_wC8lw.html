about portability and the ability to
target kind of what we call green
screens yes a framework who is designed
from the ground up to be crossed by our
api's are designed to be compatible as
possible across these devices and really
what this means for you as a developer
is smaller time investment and target
more sockets and really what we're
talking about it what's interesting
about this which is not necessarily
having this name game one across all of
these devices it's allowing you
providing underlining technology then
move seamlessly across these platforms
and let you focus on the game
differences that are going to exist as
well as how all of these devices connect
each other to provide a compelling game
experience we actually also have totally
in place to help you with that so you'll
see there that there's actually a way to
create a copy of a project for a
different platform or within visuals
commune the thing that I mentioned
earlier was next May framework provides
so really what this was designed to do
was to start laying the groundwork to
communicate how we target platforms with
exiting things to do so right now we
have these two concepts breach and I
death and right now this is very graphic
center
talk about this a little more we're
really when you target the reach
platform you're designing for
compatibility across all three devices
windows 17 series xbox 360 and windows
pcs when you go to target something like
I death they're really targeting what we
call platform showcase features so these
may be graphic equalizer functionality
that is only available on the xbox 360
for example we're devices they're
available on xbox 360 for example so
really kind of driving home a little bit
you as a developer to choose do I want
to target the broad raise of devices out
there or do I really have custom
showcase experiences that I work focus
on so with that I will do one more demo
for everybody so this is a very
simplistic game I walk around Kim Young
that was kind of a failure than that I
form the first son but once I can be
exit under the name so that's the aim
running on my windows pc with the
keyboard and mouse but what about
something like the xbox 360 so if i move
over here under my ads box and one game
library i have that same game running so
if I start this up
you'll see that it's the same thing so i
can jump collect the gems and gets the
exit so that's two of our platforms or
what about the better one so on Windows
Phone 7 series we also got that you're
running on there as well so what you'll
see here is the platforming actually
running with the same code base but what
I've done is I've actually gone in and
changed the level layout so on Windows
and xbox 360 I'd lose landscape because
those are landscape devices that we need
the monitor that sort of thing on
Windows Phone 7 series I chose to make
it a portrait experience there's also a
love an xbox 360 controller or keyboard
on this device so I've actually worked
it up to the accelerometer to move
across the screen and when I touched the
screen I actually jump and while I music
while I'm using the same game to
demonstrate this again I'll reinforce
that this is more about having great
technology we can you move across those
platforms not necessarily providing the
same gaming experience across all these
platforms
so really kind of soco little bit of
that up with XP games evo four-point-oh
we have a really powerful platter we
have graven code games working today
across xbox 360 you saw you games
running on Windows well seven series
also a managed code all working and
having great performance today on
Windows Phone 7 seriously brilliant
engineer powerful gaming platform for
everyone to develop on with your death
prophet sorry productivity we really are
providing you focus on being a game
developer not focusing on the plumbing
not focusing on the technology but
really it's about you as a game
developer being a game developer and we
have great fooling with exiting games to
be a 402 may be more productive and then
portable really being able to target
more platforms easily and again focus on
the differences that exist in your game
not be online technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
