Daniel Webster here from padma.com and
about a week ago I actually picked up a
one terabyte hard drive and of course
all sensitive electronic equipment is
encased in these anti-static films which
is just like this and the one thing that
I never noticed is that you can actually
use these anti-static films as a
rudimentary stylus so I discovered this
today while fooling around with my
device so this works with capacitive
touchscreens because the anti-static
film actually creates its own
electricity just like your finger so as
you can see I can use my finger to
scroll up and down but I can also create
a stylus out of this anti-static film
okay so I've rolled my anti-static film
into some sort of cylindrical shape kind
of like a stylus and a couple of months
ago or so Brandon actually showed how
you can get these capacitive stylus is
on eBay for a few bucks but why spend
any money at all we can probably just
create your own for free so as you can
see it does work pretty well as a stylus
I can scroll up and down I can go to my
Start menu here if I want to look at my
photos just click on there and as you
can see I'm not touching it with my
fingers at all but I'm going to show you
how it did multi-touch works okay so
with the image loaded I can actually use
the stylus and my finger to zoom in and
zoom out as you can see it works pretty
well I can also double tap and go back
and it works pretty well as a stylus
surprisingly so if you're ever in a
situation where you need to wear gloves
and also operate your device like if you
were skiing or snowboarding why not just
whip out a piece of anti-static film and
create your own stylus out of pretty
much nothing okay so there you have it
just a quick and cheap way to create a
stylus from a piece of anti-static film
of course maybe in the future someone
create could create a screen protector
that you could actually use a pen on
because I've noticed that you can scroll
sometimes with a pen if you use this
anti-static film so anyways thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
