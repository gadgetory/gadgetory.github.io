some carriers screenshots of a galaxy
gear companion app surface and HTC's new
smartphone accessories make you wonder
if you'll ever need them I'm hi Mary
vera and about the only accessory I need
on a Friday as a bottle opener and you
know what for this is out daily
today is a day full of rumors so let's
begin with a SmartWatch especially the
Samsung Galaxy gear that's slated for
Aoife we're still wondering what exactly
the SWAT watch is going to do this
special and as it turns out we've got
some leaked screenshots of the
smartphone companion app so yes this is
just going to be a companion stay tuned
for events happening next week but the
cipher that Motorola had already taken a
step at a SmartWatch with the Moto
activated wap terribly sadly and now
we've got some leaked photographs of the
new pad where they're gonna be tracking
your eyeballs with their future
SmartWatch so let's see how that one
flops with your eyeballs and speaking of
Aoife in berlin we've seen a lot of
leaked photographs a lot of them blurry
of the Sony Honami smartphone and we
finally get a gallery of the phone you
can finally what it actually looks like
and yes looks in description for the
full gallery I'm not gonna post it here
all because it's big but most
importantly we are getting this 20.7
megapixel staggering camera let's just
hope this time it delivers though now
let's talk about the iphone 5s or
exactly whatever it's gonna be called we
don't really know but we're assuming
this because we had the iphone 3gs and
the iphone 4s and every other year we
get the same phone with an S and a
couple of better specs but as it turns
out Japanese carrier a you buy KDDI has
pretty much confirmed or leaked that the
phone will be called this way apparently
they've already posted some support
documents that have to do with the phone
so iphone 5s it is let's just hope that
it's much better than just some voice
recognition thing like we had with for
us now a very unexpected leak for this
week is the fact that we've seen until
try to do processors for mobile phones
for the longest time and they haven't
really succeeded anywhere so far but
we've got already some leaked documents
of an Intel smartphone and just how
credible is that well it's already in
the FCC it's already being tested we
don't have any details on this phone
specifically no name no specs nothing
just yet but let's just hope that Intel
can figure out the phone better than
just one of its parts though I doubt
that and finally for the news of the day
HTC has just held an event where they
have announced two accessories for your
smartphone be HTC many plus and the HTC
fetch the many plus is pretty much
another mini it's pretty much a dumb
phone that connects through bluetooth to
your smartphone it'll cost you 80 bucks
and the only idea that instead of
pulling out your smartphone you pull out
your dumb phone which we still can't
figure out what for especially for that
price tag and then on the other hand the
fetch will allow you to track your phone
but it's actually a gadget that will
cost you forty dollars to do pretty much
when you can do with an application
currently it'll make your phone ring
like you can with some Google services
now that are completely free so that
leads you to the question of the day do
you see any point in these two
accessories the case of the fetch or the
case of the mini plus you know in my
particular case honestly if you live in
a country that's not safe like where I
live for example then yes the mini plus
makes sense even though trust me they'll
steal a dumb phone and the smartphone at
the same time they won't just take one
of them and in the case of the fetch I
mean it's probably too little too late
in just too expensive but leave us a
comment down below do you see any point
