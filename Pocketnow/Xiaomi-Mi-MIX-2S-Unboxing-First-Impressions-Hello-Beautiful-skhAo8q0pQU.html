successor to the device that popularized
the concept of minimal bezels and the
use of a ceramic back that device we
should all thank for the struggle of an
all display form factor and since day
one without a notch
reporting from shanghai i'm high metal
minute with pocket now and let's unbox
the goods i'm gonna have to say that for
me personally this is a true treat two
years ago i drooled over the original me
mix but given the fact that it was a
concept phone I never really got my
hands on one
lemme mix 2's comes in a very
minimalistic box that just has the word
mix tucked inside we have the phone to
the left and to the right we have a wall
charger a USB C cable all in black which
is great beneath the phone we have a box
of literature a sim ejector tool a USB C
2 3.5 millimeter dongle sadly and
there's a case wrapping everything
around which we'll discuss in a bit
first let's just remove all this plastic
off
oh yeah okay let me start by saying wow
this ceramic blend with 7000 series
aluminum feels fantastic in the hand
it's definitely reflective so much so
that it's really hard to film this phone
in this hotel room but I'm glad that I
picked a black version instead of the
white not to subtract any sort of praise
for the white and silver model but I
really like this gold and black finish
and as for the case I do love how it
blends with the phone making it look
like a solution for whenever you want to
go matte instead of glossy the me mix
2's is the second device today it's a
launched with the new baulkham
snapdragon 845 processor this particular
variant is the most expensive one today
gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigs of storage
the storage is sadly not expandable but
there are dual sim capabilities and we
also finally get another phone that
supports fast 7.5 watt wireless charging
capabilities along with a thirty four
hundred billion power battery this is a
six inch IPS LCD at two by one aspect
ratio 80 1.9% screen to body ratio and
1080p + resolution to assist with the
lack of a notch we have an ultrasonic
sensor tucked in for proximity and a
miniscule speaker at the top probably
the most controversial aspect of the
original me mix makes a return and it's
the selfie camera at the bottom right
with 5 megapixels and f2 and 1.4 microns
which is still just so awkwardly placed
now the main story of this phone is
really the primary cameras we have a
sony IMX 363 sensor at 1.4 microns on
the primary shooter giving the sensor
twice the size of the iphone 10 these
are actually two 12 megapixel cameras
the first being at a 1.8 aperture and
the second of f 2.4 and telephoto
capabilities Xiaomi made a big deal of
its the XO mark score of 101 photography
though the combined score matches that
of the iPhone 10 at 97 the company
claims hardware-based multiframe noise
reduction that's unique to competitors
and the results really prove it I mean
this is not final software and this film
pulls out some
good photos I'm even really impressed
the portrait shots and again all this is
hardware-based yes this is me UI on top
of android 8 which has many elements to
make it unique from other android phones
there's also a huge push to ai here not
just in the camera where Xiaomi claims
an insane 26 scenes being able to be
detected but also in how the phone
interacts back with you sadly I wish I
could dig more into detail but that will
have to wait for our full review as our
unit gets updated to a final version
that's ready for consumers so yeah this
is the gorgeous Xiaomi me mix 2's I've
been using it for the past two days
already around Shanghai and now Shenzhen
and I will tell you that this phone is a
beautiful piece of art I really can't
wait to tell you more about it once a
review comes up in the next few weeks
