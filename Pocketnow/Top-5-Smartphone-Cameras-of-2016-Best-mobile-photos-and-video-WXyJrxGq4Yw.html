cameras that truly kick booty 2016 was a
great year for mobile photography
whittling this list down to a top five
was a Herculean task but we're exactly
the tech channel to get that job done no
cop-outs here these are ranked based on
our experiences producing a year of real
camera reviews the most in-depth series
of phone camera reviews available on the
Internet where you can see these phones
in action with you HD resolution samples
in a variety of real-world shooting
scenarios any phone making this list is
a top tier performer so let's jump in
number five the pixel and pixel XL this
year Google killed the Nexus and
shifting their strategy to a more
consumer focus we're confident this move
will be successful and the pixel camera
demonstrates a fantastic casual user
approach to producing colorful images
this phone is the undisputed champ of
auto mode and HDR photography and in
good light delivers some of the
smoothest video we've ever seen it was a
prime contender and might have topped
this list were it not for a handful of
issues the software processing is
incredible but there are woefully few
settings or options for folks who like
exercising more control over their
content the gyro stabilization is
amazing and good light but can ghosts
severely as conditions get a bit dimmer
plus the crop on video output means you
can't ever really trust the framing on
what the phone screen is showing you the
pixel only captures audio in mono and
lastly Google has acknowledged lens
issues which won't be fixed in this
generation of hardware this is the most
flare prone phone we've ever tested
still for those potential problems the
pixel is a punchy performer which does a
great job in most shooting scenarios
number four the huawei mate 9 moving
from number five on this list to number
four we couldn't possibly find more
polar opposites in terms of features and
design while way in like a team-up again
for a second generation dual camera
system the may 9 is the most
feature-rich camera for producing still
images we've ever seen like as image
processing is even-handed and this
Hardware plays with light and contrast
in ways no other phone can replicate the
combo is capable of producing stunning
images Grasso treated to an adjustable
wide aperture mode delivering almost
DSLR style background blur this is the
absolute best software blur we've ever
seen the mate 9 is a powerhouse but that
power comes with one of the most complex
camera apps of the year requiring users
to brute-force memorize not only where
settings live but also which features
can be used in various modes this is
only the second Huawei to shoot UHD
video and we're happy to see that
increased resolution but it's not the
strongest performer on this list for
moving images image stabilization is
somewhat livelier than we'd like to see
but we are happy to hear some of the
best audio capture on any of the phones
released this year it's not for the
faint of heart but the may 9 is one of
the most formidable camera packages
available on a mobile device today
number three the iPhone 7 plus what if
you could take apples consistent image
processing and add more cutting-edge
hardware
well hypothetical person who asked that
question you would have the iPhone 7
plus dual cameras are all the rage these
days
no surprising is three of the five
phones on this list are sporting
multiple sensors was such a new hardware
idea on phones in the year 2016 we would
have expected Apple to invent dual
cameras in the year 2018 but
surprisingly apples actually on the
pulse here the iPhone solution enables a
nifty hardware zoom and a less flexible
portrait mode to help blur photo
backgrounds alongside the image
processing HDR slow motion video and
video stabilization we've all come to
know and love from iPhones past you
probably won't find a more consistent
performer on any phone though this app
is feeling dated and adding new features
while trying to maintain some notion of
simplicity is an ever increasing
exercise in futility
we also have to continue knocking Apple
for capturing only mono audio while
shooting video someday maybe they'll
learn that most iPhone users have two
ears
it could happen it's a shame the smaller
iPhone doesn't sport this extra sensor
but for folks shopping the larger iPhone
you're in for a photo treat number two
the galaxy s7 and s
an edge Samsung emits a dual sensor
setup will likely get some flavor of
that for next year's galaxy's but the s7
and s7 edge represent the best
all-rounder cameras on this list they
win precious few fights outright the
dual pixel technology for example
borrowed from DSLRs is the fastest and
most accurate focus lock we've seen on a
phone and the launch burst and recycled
times are also incredibly quick
everything else is simply top-notch we
don't have the best manual mode but it's
still excellent we don't have the best
audio capture for video but it's still
very good we don't have the smoothest
image stabilization but it's some of the
smoothest video we can capture from a
phone good optics great low-light
capabilities and excellent out of the
box novice experience and plenty of room
to grow for people who want to learn
more or improve their content creation
image processing can still land into
that hyped up Samsung look of saturation
and sharpening the lens can produce some
colorful flaring though nowhere near as
destructive as the pixel and the super
wide aperture which improves low-light
shots can make lining up macro photos a
little more difficult but there just
aren't any outright deal-breakers here
the galaxy s7 represents the best
balance of pros and cons on this list
though in a year of more daring camera
experiments it just doesn't quite land
our top spot number one the LG v 20 the
top dog the king of the hill our number
one for 2016 you will not find a more
complete platform for content creation
than what LG has delivered on the V 20
another dual camera experiment the
normal and ultra wide lenses are
flexible and fun to use the biggest
criticism of this phone is that it has
one of the weaker auto modes on this
list delivering overly compressed JPEGs
which can look a bit bland but no other
phone out of the box does a better job
of encouraging the user to actually
participate in creating their own images
options and settings are nearly as
comprehensive as what you might find on
a standalone camera but unlike Huawei
this app is laid out in a much more
familiar way and modes are easier to
navigate this phone is the undisputed
champ of providing feedback histograms
are valuable for helping users
in brightness audio meters give you
real-time visual feedback if things get
loud and with no Nokia release this year
LG stepped up to provide the best audio
capture platform of 2016 not only can
you see what's happening you don't need
to trust that the phone is capturing
good audio the v20 will output audio
while recording for users to monitor
over both cabled and Bluetooth
headphones so you can hear in real-time
that you really are getting what you
want feedback elevates this phone to a
true creation platform which encourages
rather than discourage --is empowers
rather than intimidates it's not paying
lip service to these manual modes it
really wants you to get as much out of
this camera as you can once you get used
to that ability to reference it's tough
going back to phones which lack those
visual and audio cues the highest
bitrate video capture of the year the
absolute best audio capture a very good
simple mode for casual shooters which
grows into the most comprehensive
collection of photo and video options
available all wrapped up in one of the
more durable phones of the year for
folks who are apt to really take this
tech out into the field the LG v20 is an
absolute monster plus a few honorable
mentions as stated at the beginning of
this video 2016 was a great year for
phone cameras we saw Motorola in HTC
improves significantly providing some of
the best shooters those companies have
ever produced and an insane collection
of mid-range er phones proved you don't
need to pay top dollar for excellent
output so what was your favorite camera
of the year did your phone make our top
5 drop us a comment down below this
