far we've shown you the unboxing the
hardware walk around of the motorola
droid razr in today's video we are going
to show you the first boot which is a
little bit different than what you've
seen in the past and just a very quick
overview of what comes pre-installed on
your droid razr so you don't have to be
wondering when you go to your verizon
store and pick one up for yourself let's
go ahead and get this thing booted up so
when we fire up the motorola droid razr
for the first time you see it is very
very nice looking boot animation the
intro sequence is just really kind of
cool and then it switches over to the
the standard boot up I which just loops
and loops and loops until the device is
booted up that initial sequence has some
sound with it that you can't really hear
all that well here but even with the
initial boot it boots up very fast comes
up to the touch the android to begin
screen which we're familiar with so we
go ahead and touch the android at that
point I since this is a cdma phone what
it needs to do is synchronize and
activate with the carrier in this case
verizon wireless USA now this process
does take a couple minutes in my
experience usually takes between two and
five minutes depending on how strong
your CDMA signal is it has to do this
over CDMA it cannot do it over LTE to
the best of my knowledge and it cannot
do it over Wi-Fi so you just got to wait
Wow and this isn't your sim this is the
imei of the phone while that's activated
on the 3g cdma network just kind of hang
out with it and wait for it to happen
you only have to do it once well up in
the time barter you can see that a
couple minutes have passed it's been
successfully activated and we can go
ahead and continue the process have a
nice little weight indicator has the I
don't know exactly what that is is that
supposed to be a sawtooth isn't an eye
aperture I don't know let me know in the
comments if you guys know what it is or
if you think it's something different
than that but that then brings us right
back to the touch the android to begin
you go ahead and do that and that this
is very similar to what you've seen in
the past we go ahead and put in our
google account information i'll do that
off screen for you once that's done it's
bringing you up to essentially sign up
for Motorola's backup service it's
really a nice service we'll skip that
for this process and then we're brought
to something that's not a standard
Android interface this is the social
networking and accounts page that that
Motorola's put in their most recent
phones from this one page you can
configure your device to use almost all
of your social networks out there from
facebook flickr linkedin twitter the
whole thing very nice all in one place
if you ever need to add an account you
can come back and do it now or you can
add them all right up front we'll go
ahead and skip this for the time being
because it's just stuff lying
credentials go ahead and continue
through this all right now we're at the
verizon and motorola location sharing
screen this asks you how you want to get
your information regarding geolocation
since i like as precise and geolocation
is possible i'm going to select them all
and accept the disclaimers will then
continue through to the next screen have
you guys take a look at that real fast
then we'll continue through continuing
through the next device this is just
initial setup like you used to but where
things get interesting is once you're
past that now you're brought to kind of
a how to use your device screen this is
your first smartphone let alone your
first Android one two three here's where
you get your stuff notifications on
screen and buttons and then of course we
can close that down somewhat quickly it
ties in with those videos that we saw
before that just kind of teaches you how
to use the device now something
interesting you'll see here this is a
cyanogenmod rom wallpaper and now i'm
not running cyanogenmod on this device
this is stock from from motorola but
it's imported into my wallpaper from
from my previous device which was kind
of neat Devlin that I had set up on my
bionic by the way you can see here just
like the Bionic you have the very smooth
we be like horizontal pagination on the
home screens you have five of them too
to begin with very nice very quick down
at the bottom a little bit different
application of how to get into your app
drawer there's just an app button down
there that guy that button bar looks a
little bit different from what we're
accustomed to it looks like just another
row of icons on the home screen but it's
not a little bit disappointing that you
can't add stuff down there the same way
but you can modify those however you
want relatively easily looking through
the apps this is a horizontal paginator
just like honeycomb just like ice cream
sandwich is going to have when it's
released hopefully in a few days here on
the same network I might add you can see
that we don't have very much
pre-installed apps there's not a lot of
bloatware it comes with a full Google
suite of stuff of course there are the
google apps that you can download and
install but the stuff you need like
market and maps and gmail comfy
installed on top of that we have a few
games and these are level limited games
we also have this really cool of moto
active
I don't know help happen essentially
lets you keep track of your fitness it
does come with netflix pre-installed
which is great because it's LTE and it
has a nice beautiful screen we do have
some NFL apps as well because verizon
that is the official wireless carrier of
the National Football League so we get
to have those on there disappointing
that we can't put those on other devices
on other networks but such as the case
of exclusivity and then of course we
have a few verizon specific apps as well
some of them are redundant some of them
help you get into your account
information of course you've got some
apps that take you back in and let you
watch the tutorials that we skip through
and also lets you set up their device
again you can launch right back into
that setup wizard if you would like the
home screen is 3d like we mentioned it
has kind of 3d apps than 3d widgets they
are scrollable just like we've come to
expect with Motorola it is not a true
Android UI it's not a true Android
launcher not a stock launcher I should
say but it's very very close
so there we saw what was pre-loaded on
the motorola droid razr it's very very
light as far as bloatware goes a few NFL
apps that we could do without a few
verizon apps that are kind of redundant
but we've come to expect that with
verizon phones and in all honesty this
phone has a lot of space on it so it's
not really bloating up your phone and
hampering what you can install and what
you can put on there there's plenty of
room to grow especially with that 16 gig
micro SD card pre-installed that you
could always swap out with a 32 gig if
you needed to overall very nice if you
like seeing videos that tell you what
kind of stuff comes pre-loaded on your
phones before you go in and get it make
sure you give this video a big thumbs up
if you want to see future videos about
the motorola droid razr and other smart
phones Android Windows Phone iOS you
name it make sure you subscribe to our
video channel it'll keep you up to date
and it'll let you know things your
friends don't know unless you get them
to subscribe to and of course head on

news as it happens for pocket now
