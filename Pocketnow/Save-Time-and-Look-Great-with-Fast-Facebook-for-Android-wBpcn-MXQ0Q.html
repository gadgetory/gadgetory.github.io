date with all my news whether that's
news about what's going on in my
friend's life or news that's going on in
the tech world or really the world
around me is through Facebook I know but
it's one of the best ways to do it so
you can imagine how frustrated I am when
I'm using facebook on my android and
it's just so ridiculously slow but with
this new app fast Facebook might not be
quite that slow let's go take a look so
this is my samsung galaxy nexus i am
connected to Wi-Fi so we're not being
slowed down by any kind of wireless data
here icon is kind of simple it's a
tilted back tile with 2 f's on it for
fast facebook let's go ahead and launch
it it opens up relatively quickly one of
the things that you'll notice is this
nice background now you can change that
you can come in here if I can tap
squarely on it and we can change the
background to one of the default
backgrounds that's what I have it set to
right now I can choose a background for
my gallery or I can choose just simple
gray so for the purpose of this video
we'll go ahead and leave it on default
backgrounds the the the default that
comes in the app is simple gray so we'll
go ahead and back out of that and if you
notice it's a very nice very ice cream
sandwich like interface so if we look
you can see how many people have thumbs
up how many people have commented who it
is the post it what they said and then
down here doesn't show up well on this
background but you've got the date and
time of the post it's very quick as you
can see here I'm scrolling just really
nice really fast we do have pictures for
example pocket now as articles all have
pictures associated with them we can
give that one a thumbs-up by coming in
here from what I can tell you do have to
go into this separate view the post view
is what I'm calling that to be able to
give it a thumbs up or to be able to
comment a little bit of a
our description that you can scroll here
and then these are the comments looks
like there are only a couple on this one
otherwise we could scroll it this little
icon down here lets you go out to the
source so in this case it would fire up
that article in the pocket now calm
website this lets me share it and I just
hit my multi task by mistake again
thumbs up and if i wanted to post a
comment I could do that very quickly
very easily you can see how nice and
fluid these animations are has a very
nice ice cream sandwich like interface
so the first downside unlike the regular
facebook app where i can just keep
scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
this has a limit I don't know exactly
what that limit is but it's about
one-tenth of what it should be maybe
even less so not an awful lot now that's
because it's using the Facebook API is
to be able to get all of the data into
the the app itself now let's go ahead
and keep looking this is my little
notification stuff and that you can see
here this Scrolls pretty well and it
actually has quite a bit of
notifications in it so kind of nice how
does that the back button doesn't always
do what I think that it's supposed to do
for you know for that one I expected it
to take me out of the notifications but
it took me out of the app still in beta
still a little bit of quirks to work
around but still overall not bad if i
want to write a message i can do that if
i want to post my location i can do that
you can see my wallpaper just changed
there but i want to upload a picture i
can do that through my gallery i want to
put in a post i can do that just as
easily so here you can see i can't just
touch out of that i actually have to use
the back button to take me out overall
not bad refresh either by clicking the
refresh button or by pulling down to
refresh you can see where it says
refreshing right there and come in and
send new messages to a friend using that
button i can search for things look at
all of my peeps in here all it goes
ilion of them
and of course look at pictures in there
as well so I don't want to embarrass any
of my friends by showing you those so
we'll just go ahead and leave it there
the app again is called fast facebook
it's a beta it's by team too soft it is
free I haven't seen any ads in it at all
so far hopefully there aren't any but
that remains to be seen they might have
to put an ad in there to monetize it
hopefully they don't do anything like
air push or whatnot that would be bad
but very cool much much faster than the
regular facebook app a much nicer
interface from from where I sit but I'm
interested to know what you think do you
like this better than the stock facebook
app why and why not go ahead and let us
know down in the comments so we can we
can know you know what did I miss what
would you like to see done differently
and of course what's not here that you
would like to see in a facebook app let
us know and head on over to
pocketnow.com to read tips tricks news
and articles about not only android
phones but also other tablets and other
smartphones as well for pocket now i'm
