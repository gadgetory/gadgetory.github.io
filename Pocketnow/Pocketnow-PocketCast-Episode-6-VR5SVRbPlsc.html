episode of the pocket now pocket cast
I'm Brandon minimun editor-in-chief of
pocket now also on the line is the
managing editor of pocket now Evan glass
Evan say hi okay Brannon hey guys hello
and so today we are going to talk about
phones because we think about phones
when we sleep when we eat when we're
taking a shower and doing anything in
between and we are obsessed with phones
would you say you're obsessed with
phones Evan um upsets is a pretty strong
word which is I'm sure why you used it
um so so yeah a little bit they're very
good i mean even when i worked at
engadget the phones were always my
favorite part of the job um so yeah I've
always had a special thing for there's
always been a special place in my heart
for the smartphone well said it's it's
the probably the most interesting
segment of consumer technology because
it involves faster than I pick pick your
topic I mean there's there are new
phone's constantly new technologies new
operating system it's like a constant
race among these companies yeah and more
than that the phone is really the I
would say just sort of Swiss Army knife
of gadgets and consumer electronics you
know it does almost everything that that
your other electronics do plus it makes
phone calls no I mean you got your
entertainment so it sort of like a TV /
you know PMP plays music obviously it's
a gps device of course it's a computer
with a browser so so i think the reason
people are so many phones is because
they do so many things yeah and and i
think i think HTC in there there you
campaign characterized that real well by
saying phones the first thing you see in
the morning the last thing you see at
night it helps you remember it helps you
to forget it's it's very true and
they're not even there not even
calculating in those of us who dream
about phones oh yeah it's the it's the
first thing you dream about and the last
thing you dream about exactly very good
all right well let's actually go into
some things we're very proud our podcast
test was featured in the zune
marketplace as a featured podcast for a
few days last week so that was really
really exciting so we're excited people
are listening to this and we're having a
lot of fun doing this so let's jump
right in we're going to talk a little
bit about iOS to start this week we saw
I believe it was on 27 februari a new
kind of notification system for iOS that
works if you've jailbroken your phone
it's called mobile notifier and the way
that it works is is very intuitively and
we should preface this by saying that
the iOS notification system right now is
so last generation I mean you get these
intrusive pop-ups you can't you have to
action on them right away you can't
ignore them for a second like you can of
webos do you find fault in how iOS
notifications are presented Evan mmm I
don't think it's too bad um I mean it's
to me it's it's no worse than than what
you were getting up and some of the
other operating systems it could be
better but um I think what's to me
what's more interesting is what it is
what you can do with the home screen
here right right right before we get
into that let's briefly talk about how
other operating systems do do
notifications just to get some color
here so in Windows Phone 7 you get a
little toaster notification at the top
which you can swipe away with your
finger or you can leave up there or
after a period of time it will go away
so that doesn't interrupt you now
windows on Windows Mobile 65 and below
though they would just have regular
bottom of the screen popup notifications
you know it's been it's been a while
since I used 6.5 was a bottom of the
screen or top of the screens i believe
it was bottom of the screen if you got a
text message it would it would pop up in
a little white box you know that would
take up you know maybe twenty percent of
the bottom of the screen and then like
you said you would have to action on it
either ignore or reply
fair fair and then we've got webos which
of course a lot of people think have one
of the best notification systems where
the screen size will actually shrink and
a notification will appear below the
screen actually they can build up and
kind of like in Windows Phone 7 when you
want to take it away you swipe it off
the screen and then the the display size
sort of effectively increases or the
amount of resolution you get on your
main application a lot of people really
like that and then we've got android
which of course puts everything in the
notification shade up in the top then
you've got to reach your thumb up to the
top pull down the notification shade and
and from there you can either dismiss
all of them or you can action on one
which will cause that particular one to
go away this is I note have you ever
found that the the notification shade on
on samsung device is a little bit
annoying and that it'll it'll bounce off
the bottom of the screen when you don't
want it to so if you pull it down too
fast it'll actually close again is that
what you're saying yeah it's got dumb
it's got some inertia to it and I don't
like it I much prefer how motorola does
it where you know you just pull it down
and it drops down and and you know you
have to you know use some some actual
only call it force but it has to be a
dedicated upward swipe and and when
Samsung I found that you know unless
you're really holding the shade and you
slowly pull it down it'll bounce right
back that's that's annoying it's kind of
like a real shade though right so you
pull it down and then it just Yanks back
up right but this is I think a case
where we don't want our digital world to
mirror the the real world I agree with
you there I think the notification
system and Android having to put your
finger at the top of the screen is a
little bit annoying which is why
launcher pro is so great because you can
map the home button to bring down the
notification shade when you're on the
home screen so you don't even have to
move your thumb past a few inches from
the from the bottom of the screen
nice so yeah so mobile notifier works
pretty awesomely so you'll get a little
pop-up a little strip on the top from
there you can either tap on it dismiss
it or you can open it now if you dismiss
it what will happen is when you open the
multitask menu when you double tap on
the home button you'll actually see a
build up of your notifications so even
if you dismiss every notification you
get you can still come back to them when
you go to multitask an action on them
from that screen so it's it's a it's a
really smart way to do things which begs
the question is Apple finally going to
improve their notification system in iOS
5 do you think that's a good bet Evan I
don't know honestly I mean ha I
certainly think that because you know
thing things are being done in the
jailbroken community that's not going to
push Apple one way or the other I do
think in general that the that the home
screen and the lack of customization is
starting to get stale and and I think
now that Apple finally sees excuse me
Android as a real competitor we're going
to we are going to see some some ability
to do other things with your home screen
other than just a big block of icons I
don't think people want that anymore and
and frankly it's pretty dated you know
people want some some real time
information on their screens like with
this mobile notify or how you get you
know the little drop down with each time
you get a message but but maybe you know
i want that i want to widget with my
text messages in them are you know a
widget with my MLB scores or whatever um
when that's something where where where
Apple and and I'll say I'm Windows Phone
to have really fallen quite behind yeah
the the widget model seems to be very
desirable from a lot of people and we it
seems that every passing generation of
iOS people think that we're finally
going to get widgets on the home
screen no longer will just be icon after
icon after icon but they haven't done it
yet probably because it would require a
developer support it would require a lot
of software optimization to not kill the
battery when your MLB squirrel or
loading oh it's yeah it would be a huge
undertaking for them no doubt also
because they would probably have to you
know toss instance or a landscape
support do why would they have to do
that well I guess they wouldn't have to
but um you know it seems to be something
that would that would give them a leg up
I would say if Apple could finally get
done because no one's been been able to
do that really well yeah um you know
turning turning tortured into landscape
when when there's widgets on the screen
and I think if anyone could could work
it out it would be Apple probably by
restricting what you could do with your
widgets but nonetheless I think the
problem with widgets isn't so much the
landscape orientation because like the
desire Z gets it kind of right you can
get launcher pro and rotate your device
it gets kind of right I think the issue
is making it intuitive the problem with
widgets is that most of the time they're
not updated when you want them to be
they use a lot of battery life that use
cpu cycles it just it's a mess I mean
they give you seven home screens on most
android phones but i tend to use one or
two of them because i'm not going to be
flipping my finger a thousand times to
the left to see widgets that aren't even
going to be updated when I want them to
be so I think there's a real opportunity
here for Apple to use their innovation
to finally do something better with
widgets and real-time information
glanceable stuff hey have you gotten
that cool clock on any of your android
yet the one that was ripped from the
newer LG phones snow gets that sort of
3d clock with um with weather on it I
saw that it wasn't too appealing really
i love it i think i think is totally
cool does it do anything rash so i
compared to like the no sense flip clock
or no duh or a blur like digital clock
you know it's got some 3d too it's got a
lot of information it just looks nice
yeah we're gonna now yeah it's basically
at a a new spin
on the HTC weather clock it has a little
bit of depth to it which is interesting
yeah I'm digging it try it out try it
out very good let us move on so
hopefully the takeaway here is that
hopefully there will be some sort of
improvement to the notification system
in iOS come iOS 5 which we should
presumably be hearing about come June or
so as is typically the case with Apple
releases all right so some more iOS
stuff and never get it on what's that to
never get enough forget enough
especially if you enjoy the iphone yeah
so finally 18t is giving users the
option with with iOS 4.3 which comes out
on Friday on March 11 to tether
wirelessly of course you could do this
if you jailbreak your phone and you get
a program called I think it's my why for
10 bucks or so now is this this is
tethering or is this mobile hotspot
aren't they pretty much the same thing
well tethering is where you're using
either a USB or Bluetooth connection
well mobile hotspot is is over Wi-Fi and
the hotspot is pretty dead easy because
you know you're just connecting like you
would to any other to any other on
access point but you know as anyone
who's tried to to tether with Bluetooth
or USB knows it can be a little bit
trickier anyway as I recall Apple
promised that kind of tethering number
of years ago yeah do you remember that I
was trying to think about which keynote
but Steve Jobs said you know and and
were expected to release this feature
that the tethering later but we're
working with AT&amp;amp;T to get it up him I
believe it was the same one where they
promised um mms wasn't mad yeah that's
right so it was the iphone 3gs and I
mean that came through fine but but as
far as i know the tethering sort of just
kept getting delayed and delayed
and and it's it's actually a little bit
surprising that they're finally doing it
because there are still a lot of
complaints about 18 tease network not
being up to par and you'd think that if
they were going to let people tether
they'd have the infrastructure improved
to know yeah so so the pricing for this
is instead of the the data plan how much
is your data plan Evan for the iphone 25
I believe it's 30 but i have i have a
grandfather into the unlimited all right
so you have the $30 unlimited
grandfather plant so everyone else now
goes with the $25 two gigabyte plan if
you want to use your phone as a hotspot
you have to pay twenty dollars more
which I guess is reasonable if you think
about how much Verizon and Sprint charge
to use the hotspot feature paying 45
dollars a month will get you four
gigabytes of data and if you use an
extra gigabyte your charge ten dollars
per so I mean these I sort of think that
these these tethering plants need to
catch up with the way people are using
the devices I mean I can see you know
two gigabytes being ok 44 stuff you're
doing on your phone because not a lot of
people are streaming video for a long
time or you know and use extremes not
going to take that that much that much
of your allotment up but when you're
talking about using the phone as an
access point and you know then using
your laptop as a sling player to watch
Netflix you know try to watch a full
length movie I mean you're gonna you're
going to kill that those those megabytes
and gigabytes in no time yeah it's a
it's a game changer when you start
tethering have you looked at how much
data you use Evan on a monthly basis I
don't look at that but I think I mean I
think it's less than a gigabyte
generally but that's because you know i
have i have other devices to use to
tether with i think if i tethered using
my phone it would be a lot more yeah
especially if I go on vacation I mean
just watching one Phillies game that'll
that's going to eat you know
giggs you'll you'll easily go over your
your allotment yeah so it's good that
they're giving 4 gigabytes of data would
have been extra cool if they would have
done something unlimited but then people
would obviously take advantage of that
and it would really detrimental to their
network alrighty let us move on let us
sounds like lettuce selenium salad
lettuce mm-hmm that it did this is good
do you like salads I do probably not as
much as as you'd like them but um yeah
in general and more of a a hamburger guy
than a lettuce guy although i do like
lettuce on my hamburgers ah there you go
keep it green mm-hmm except the the
lettuce that they use it you know fast
food restaurants is typically whitish in
color applying that there are no
nutrients I'm surprised that you would
even know what fast food looks like all
right I've been to a fast food
restaurant really I'll have to talk
about this more tape true so let's talk
about on februari 28th kind of a minor
piece of news but sort of symbolic sony
ericsson head developer made a comment
that they're actually in favor of
routing if we do it right of course
routing is the process of granting your
your phone superuser privileges so that
you can install custom roms you can do
things to the software that basically
the OEM doesn't allow you to do out of
the box and of course on development
forums across the internet you can root
pretty much any device and it's a good
thing to do if you know what you're
doing because it gives you a lot of
flexibility and what typically happens
is that it's known that manufacturers
don't want users to root their device
because it's going to cause problems
it's going to cause people to call in
and say hey my phone's broken it's going
to cause people to go back to the stores
return their device and that's a
legitimate concern it is a very
legitimate concern yeah I mean there
there are cases when if you try to root
your phone you'll you'll you'll break it
which means that
you need a lot of expertise to fix a big
problem you might not even brick it I
mean you you just might get stuck
somewhere on a flashing process if your
time to put your own Rahman and you know
people aren't going to go to to XDA
first you know the first thing they're
going to do is call up you know 18t a
verizon or motorola and and they don't
want that that hassle and you know that
there's a question should day you know
should they have to deal with with with
inexperienced users trying to do do i'm
trying to undertake cats that are there
really meant for um for people who have
more experience they should they should
require users to take a test to
determine the level of expertise and
absolutely like a driver's license you
know flash yeah exactly maybe a touch
screen monitor like you're getting your
learner's permit you know what happens
if you see a you know how do you how do
you get your device into flash mode or
whatever if they answer the wrong thing
then denied denied d and denied so I
mean so if is it is it in OEM benefit to
say okay we're fine if you root your
phone I don't know I mean I think that
that in in sort of the little world that
that we live in we're reading a lot
about phones and going on two forms a
lot it's it's a big deal but I think in
the general population you know out of
all the people who buy a given a android
phone it's probably not that big of a
deal in other words I think that it's
it's exaggerated because of the reading
that we do and and the people that we
talk to yeah you're right i mean the
statistics are vastly skewed towards in
other words most people don't hurt their
phone i mean in our in our universe a
lot of people do because people that
read pocket our power users and they
want to explore their phones and tinker
and you know i don't even think it would
matter if om's were to officially
sanctioned routing because it's going to
happen anyway
and they can go and send scouts to the
forums and learn about software
weaknesses and learn about how people
are creative creatively using their
interfaces but I think that's the extent
of it I don't think we're going to see
some more official stance on unrooting
to the point where one day sony ericsson
includes instructions on here's what to
do to root your device just doesn't
that's not going to happen I think it's
possible that they'll make it easier to
do but they're still going to be some
sort of barrier to entry that as you
like to say so that that the average
person is going to have trouble doing it
but but the people who know what they're
doing are going to know where to find
the tools and you know hopefully know
where to find the support if something
goes wrong yeah exactly i mean that's
pretty much the only thing they can do
is make it easier to route but even that
I mean you know some of the motorola
devices were assumed to be unreadable
and then they were routed and you know
it was just a matter of that game came
along and gabe came along and you know
took care of business I think I study
his atrix today oh I he is ah Tegra 2
well that's good that he's getting the
atrix let's talk about the atrix and
motorola likely bringing the laptop dock
to upcoming smartphones this was posted
on februari 28th implying that this
laptop dock thing is sort of a long-term
strategic bet for motorola and they're
going to keep bringing it out and keep
bringing it out and make a standard dock
connector to hopefully make this a thing
and you know we've talked about this on
the on the podcast about whether the
laptop dock makes sense and we kind of
concluded that for some people yes for a
lot of people man I don't know I mean I
feel like for for people who are buying
netbooks and there's a lot of those
people that that this might no be a be a
totally legitimate substitute for that
but for anyone is obviously looking for
a real laptop power and needs you know
any sort of gaming any sort of real
multitasking
is just not going to do it so it could
go either way now the question is are
those people who are buying netbooks
going to want to spend the same price as
a netbook and perhaps more for a device
that doesn't have you know a CPU in it
or any of the guts that you're getting
with a dedicated laptop that I don't
know I'm I've been feeling the price on
these things is going to have to go down
before they really find a widespread
audience yeah I mean it's the price is
so it's so important here I mean it's
got to be it's it's got to make sense it
compared to a netbook and even compared
to a tablet which is sort of taking over
the the netbook sales the world what are
you talking about netbooks tablets are
taking over the world they are taking
over the world sure it's you know
everyone has different use cases and and
for me the only advantage I see to this
dock is that one it's really thin really
lightweight so it's very unsubstantial
and to you don't have to fumble around
with with the internet connection so if
you've got a netbook right or even a
tablet well not not a tablet cut because
that makes it easy let's say a netbook
because you need a keyboard and you want
to turn on the internet tethering well
let's see you turn on the device it
boots up you know about 10 seconds you
go to the ATT 3g wizard or the verizon
connection manager and you start the
connection which usually takes another
10 to 20 seconds I know we're
complaining about 30 seconds here but in
the case of the motorola doc you plug in
your phone turn on the device instantly
in boom within five seconds you're
connected ready to browse the web ready
to use everything with its full
functionality well when you say full
functionality what what what is the the
lapdock bringing to the table you want
you're getting um you know Firefox
browsing but you're basically only
getting a bigger screen other than that
right i mean it's not like you're you're
getting a new OS on there you're still
just going to be able to use your your
regular Android programs yeah so you're
getting a bigger screen and more power
and ever since using a google voice and
being able to manage my text messages
online it's so much more comfortable to
do
than to pick up a phone and to go in
text messaging app so with the with the
doc the motorola doc you know you get a
virtual picture of your not a picture
it's a it's a rendering of your phone
screen and you can actually use your
phone while you browse the web so I
don't know it's almost like I'm talking
myself into the idea right it's cool i
mean if you're you know already sitting
down somewhere but if you're on the go
that you know that's just not really a
practical solution you're still going to
have to be you know thumb typing true
true independent that's sort of the
other thing is that that the whole set
up there with the with the doc it seems
a little bit dumb I won't say fragile
but I don't know it doesn't seem like
the type of thing that you know it it
just seems a little ungainly I guess to
have that sticking out the back like
that I thought that maybe they would
come up with a little bit more elegant
solution yeah maybe some sort of sort of
plugging in like a cartridge at least so
that's there's a lot did you see I'm um
you know I am knock nak our friend yeah
the neck neck design which we talked
about the tablet yeah weird that I think
was called the tube where they have a
smartphone that actually inserts right
inside the tablet I thought that was
kind of an innovative idea yeah yeah
we'll put a link up to that on the
podcast description the HTC to buy neck
and basically lets you insert your phone
and then get sort of a if it's a windows
phone 7 you get like a windows phone 7
tablet interface if it's an android
phone your tablet turns into an android
phone that that is awesome I mean that
would be sort of revolutionary I think
to be able to take your Android phone
plug it into a larger screen and then
you get like a you know two or three
times larger resolution and more power
and that would be awesome you know I was
almost gonna buy a pico projector this
weekend no you were yeah I was uh I had
to go pick up a mouse and I and I had
him there but yeah I don't know I just
thought that there wouldn't it would be
like a fun gadget to have but there
wouldn't actually
use many of you such cases for it what
would you use it with well it's got a
number of inputs including hdmi so you
know you can you could go regular
composite out of your iPhone you can go
hdmi out of your laptop or out of your
droid x I mean it's definitely got it's
definitely got some some possibilities
in terms of Isis you can hook up to it
but but at but you know what am I
actually going to going to be on the go
and I want to watch a movie you know a
whole movie on someone's wall how much
was it and what was the resolution it
was done it's the optima 301 that i was
looking at and it's um it's four hundred
dollars with that wvga resolution and
fifty lumens if you have it plugged into
the wall which is pretty high for for
these sort of things wbj is it's it's
ideal for a smartphone on an unrelated
topic it would be really cool now the
projectors have come down in price
projectors that can do HD resolution to
take a projector and have it act as
almost a fourth monitor if you can
picture this you sit at a desk with a
white wall in front of you and you have
the projector behind you and you can
kind of use your whole wall suddenly
becomes a monitor you can put you know
Twitter up there or something like a
timer or your email inbox that that
seems so cool yeah absolutely i think
that the problem there is is the same
problem people have had trying to hook
their computers up two up two projectors
is that you have to get the the fonts
big enough you know you have to change
the DPI so that you can you can see a
screen that's you know more than a foot
away from your face oh good point but
but wouldn't you know just by the sheer
size of the display let's say you get a
10 foot monitor on your wall I mean
wouldn't that just blow up the fonts all
already yeah but I mean you don't need a
super short throw projector to get a 10
foot throw if the projectors only you
know a foot or two away from the law I
don't even know if it's possible oh well
I was talking about kind of putting it
behind you you know wow I
yeah okay yeah yeah theoretically it's a
it's a very good idea and I'm sure we'll
see something like that and and in fact
they'll probably have it with um you
know with with minority report style
touch displays oh I think they already
have that it's just extremely expensive
a projector that can you can actually
use you can't it's like a touchscreen it
becomes a touchscreen well yeah it
probably uses cameras for you know
motion sensing I mean that's sort of
what surfaces so yeah there's some cool
stuff coming up I definitely don't think
that we've hit the peak of technology at
it happened in 99 with windows XP that
was a good OS it was a good OS in a
superior to fist of course well anyway
let's let's get back on topic now we are
talking or hearing about Sprint's ctia
event which you will be at Evan right on
march twenty second yes correct so
you'll be there and the rumor here
someone tipped and gadget with the
possibility that we'll see a nexus s 4g
and an EVO 3d so let's sort of look at
both of those individually a nexus s 4g
making it the third Nexus S to be on a
US carrier is this a good move for
sprint Evan wait when you say to the
third Nexus S you're talking about
t-mobile and then the rumored 18 t1 yeah
um yeah absolutely i mean you know the
you you use the nexus s you like it
right it's good phone great phone but
had wimax would be pretty pretty dope
pretty dope indeed so that's that's a
good move um definitely having the nexus
s it at this point it's a little bit
stale but i mean you know t-mobile just
released the galaxy s 4g and people seem
to be very excited about that so it you
know just because it was released late
last year doesn't mean that all
excitement has waned for it and then the
evo 3d
for sprint you know all these carriers
have these brands and they're literally
almost franchises so there's the droid
franchise on Verizon there's the evo
franchise on sprint what does AT&amp;amp;T have
18 seas got nothing but t-mobile as my
touch my time they also have like the g1
and g2 they've got the g series ok so
for sprint EVO is huge there's so much
positive energy surrounding the evo
brand anytime I hear somebody talk about
the evo out in public they are very
excited about it and even to this day a
year later after its release the evo 4g
still a phone that sells quite well and
one that lots of people enjoy so they
also yeah that's because I mean HTC
isn't really making phones that are that
much superior to the to the evo 4g even
at this point that's true there's not
much out there that that sort of changes
the equation although the evo 4g to the
desire HD the desire HD had a newer
generation processor had more RAM better
battery life so there has been some
modest bumps and that's on the periphery
though isn't it I mean it the phones i
would think are going to function
essentially the same more or less yeah
there's nothing really that that new to
the tape bringing the table so so they
have the evo shift 4g that was the
second evo and now the evo 3d possibly
sprint being i guess it would be the
first US carrier to do 3d on a
smartphone yeah and 3d is certainly the
the buzzword in 2011 you know LG is
going to be out of the gate first with
the Optimus 3d and the 3d capability
really comes into play when you're
recording video and taking pictures they
there's no 3d interface on it or any
sort of new paradigm of interacting with
your phone it's just basically capturing
media and displaying on the phone so we
got to wonder a few things one is the
evo 3d going to be HTC what do you think
of it yeah definitely do you think that
the evo 3d could be the
first US version of say the pyramid I
don't think that just because something
like a 3d screen I think would have made
it into the rumored specs you know who
ever knew those specs or who out you
know assuming that those specs are
correctly the dual core and the qhd
screen it would seem that that a 3d
display would be big enough to note
that's a good point for those that are
unfamiliar the pyramid is HTC's assumed
high-end phone to be released hopefully
at ctia with a dual-core chip and as I
mentioned qhd display so so HTC Samsung
LG who do you think's making this oh I
think it I think it is going to be HTC
it's it's pretty rare that you see that
you see a brand move manufacturers in
fact the only one that I can think of in
in recent memory is nexus yeah yeah
you're right well actually don't forget
about the droid I mean HTC and motorola
are doing droids on verizon yeah but i
think that the next incredible is
actually dropping the droid the droid
branding so I mean droid is basically a
verizon thing and I bet you if you went
and asked if you ask people who are
doing branding at verizon they'll tell
you it was a mistake to to brand the
droid eris and the droid incredible
because it really confuses people i mean
i'm sure you you've talked to people who
who want a droid and they don't know the
difference between a droid and an
android phone and yeah a lot of that
problem is because is because verizon
let that branding you know cover more
than one manufacturer yeah it is does
verizon of course they do actually I was
gonna ask for does verizon have any
android phones that are called droids
and they have some lower end phones i
believe like the ally is that all
verizon um uh yeah i think it is i'm on
the present site new they definitely
have like or they were supposed to have
the env pro from LG the
going to have the revolution yeah okay
so so the answer is that they do release
non droid phones that run Android as
confusing as that sounds coming out
right but but not really high-end other
than the fascinate right that's a good
point and you know I doubt Adele will
see a droid galaxy s2 or you know yeah
definitely not playing at you playing
jacks over there I just broke something
ok cool so let's move on from Sprint's
announcements and you know we're still
waiting for the Sprint keo sex kyocera
echo which we've seemed to forgotten a
little bit about as is usually the case
between the announcement and the release
as is usually the case with forgettable
devices reefer yeah yeah I you know
hopefully uh hopefully it will be a
great device although you know when we
had hands-on with it it was kind of man
yeah I don't have too high hopes i think
it's a it's a cool form factor but i
just don't think that there's going to
be enough developer support for it and
and so those those two screens are sort
of going to be wasted yep although for
some people i mean just just having that
much space to web browse might be enough
if you know if the only out they had
that was optimized with the rub web
browser them that might be enough for
some people yeah but the problem is that
it's just it's choppy i mean you stretch
a web page to both screens and you
scroll down and it is it's not it's not
pretty well why is it getting stretched
why can't they just why can't they just
use the increased resolution to give you
more of the page oh they are they're
definitely doing that but it still
doesn't perform very well well we'll
have to see when we take it into the
pocket now labs how it performs that is
true all right let's move on here we're
talking about the xperia arc which has
crossed the FCC with AT&amp;amp;T frequencies
this was on march forth just a few days
ago do you think that 18 g is actually
going to sell this or do you think it's
going to be sold unlocked I think
they'll sell it i think i think sony
ericsson is making a big push and
they've said that all four of these um
these devices that we've seen so far
this year which are the let's see the
ark the play the neo and the pro all
four of those are going to be sold in
the US on US carriers plus four more
devices that we haven't even seen yet so
we're supposedly we're looking forward
to on eight total sony ericsson devices
subsidized on US carriers this year hmm
that is a lot of Sony Ericsson and
they're they're really making a push so
so if Sony Ericsson can can get past
being sony ericsson and releasing stuff
late and not updating it whatever then I
think they really have a good shot of
you know they're they're looking at they
want to own twenty-five percent of the
android market they didn't give a date
by what by that point by they didn't
give a date for that target but but they
definitely have have an eye on owning
quite a bit of this of this smartphone
vertical yeah yeah and you can you can
you can tell they're they're very
serious about this i mean the phones
that they announced at at CES where
we're pretty interesting and and
certainly having more presence in the
united states on the carriers will help
so the ark trying to figure out the the
headline with the ark the coolest thing
about the Ark is that it's it's very
high quality and yet it's extremely thin
extremely light so it definitely has it
definitely has a place in the market but
the apparently the galaxy s2 is going to
be even thinner right and it's got
better hardware specs they're so close
that it's just it's it's a draw I mean
dual core versus a single core oh well I
was talking about the thinness of the
bow the thing is yeah but I mean you
know if that's a wash then then you're
going to start looking at
components and that's where you know
that's where the the samsung really has
has the edge a significant edge you
better not have the edge you better have
3g or 4g uh uh uh it's a joke yeah oh
man that's not just informative it's
also hilarious the pocket cast hey I'm
uh I'm thinking about edge because we're
getting a phone in this week that is a
new European phone can't talk about it
yet and I'm going to be running on edge
so you know I'm gonna be saying that
word a lot soon and complaining about it
I'm sure Oh plenty absolutely every
every time I talk to you I'm going to
want to complain about the edge uh cool
so let us move on next we are talking
about a sony ericsson phone that these
shots keep coming out it's a it's a
qwerty device side sliding windows phone
7 device sony ericsson you know already
already said they're they're going to
have a windows phone 7 strategy but this
device looks kind of me me two ish me
too compared to themselves i mean it it
sort of looks like you know maybe like a
little bit like an ex time with a
keyboard maybe but it does look like an
extent the only saving grace here and if
you've got the picture pulled up evan i
think the only really interesting thing
about this phone I mean it's probably
gonna have a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon with
512 megabytes of RAM a wvga screen all
this stuff we know but it quite possibly
could be a very very thin slider and
it's very difficult to get a thin slider
yeah although I mean if you look at
those now i'm looking at if you look at
those keys they look almost totally
flushed with the screen or with the body
don't day there's home doesn't almost no
looks like there's almost no rise above
the you seem i'm talking about yeah yeah
they are they are pretty flat there it's
funny because i think that some OEM is
trying to make the
look better than they function yeah
totally like all these like Chiclets
keywords I'm not a big fan at all they
look cool but who is a fan I mean that
HTC got it right with the touch pro 2
and 7 pro and those keyboards look good
and they function well I don't
understand why they can't do something
like that without actually doing that
without actually getting without getting
sued by HTC for her you know copying a
design so we'll have to see what happens
with the sony ericsson slide out
hopefully it'll it'll be different than
at least the quantum which is the other
slide out qwerty for windows phone 7 how
about don't forget your favorite the DVP
oh yeah the dell venue pro but that's a
different type of slide is a different
type of slide that phone is awesome all
right let's move on so we last week i
think was last week we're talking about
the pre nodo windows phone 7 update this
is the update that does nothing except
prepare devices for the copy and paste
update which is going to happen like
this week or next one and then some
Samsung users reporting that their
phones were stopping midway through
their phones were being bricked
Microsoft came out and said only 100
users had the happy issue and presumably
today is when you believe that 100 I
mean that seems a little out like first
of all could there really be that for
you and then second of all if there are
that few would Microsoft really be able
to count them like that I know right it
seems very suspect and you know this was
a big deal for Microsoft to prove to the
world that they can do updates over the
air and so I I'd been checking seven
times today on on my focus to see if the
updates gonna happen and I just checked
right now it's not there so yeah I know
thank you for your sympathy by the way
wait what do you have a an 18-2 sim in
there I don't but Adam was able to
update one of his devices without a sim
so yeah the atoms out well I'm doing
what Adam did you know I don't know
Adams I mean I don't know
how to set up exchange certain active
sinks on Windows Phone 7 and most people
don't know how to do that what I know
how to do that I'm saying most people
you're not those people but well it it
it has nothing to do with sim as as as
far as I think it's known I think Tony's
chiming in that there's really no
correlation it pulls any Wi-Fi
connection or data connection available
so I'm going to keep checking and if
anything happens I'll uh I'll holler at
you a holler back cool well let's move
on one more story to cover before taking
some questions from Twitter so it was
kind of strange with this mango update
for windows phone 7 which will of course
bring ie9 with better browser
performance it will also bring fast app
switching to windows phone 7 very very
very important update to Windows Phone 7
because it kind of brings it on par with
the functionality of a lot of other
smartphone platforms and paul theroux
from wind supersite said that there may
be no mango update this year because the
schedule is is near nearly impossible to
meet and then Mary Jo Foley reports that
uh that that Microsoft's going to have
the code to OEMs and partners by the
early fall and of course there's a
there's a delay early fall implies let's
see what's early five and kind of
September right yeah more like a forward
september-october even with that time
frame OEMs have to test and deploy
updates and I mean I I think Paul is is
right here although I don't have any
inside information that i can report on
but it sounds like they're going to get
the code ready by fall it's not enough
time to get Windows Phone 7 mango ready
by 2011 yeah I agree um I mean I think
didn't they have the or from what I
heard they had the the node 0 code you
know in the fall it was already
go but there's still a lot of things
that have to do that you need to go on
you know a lot of testing and and more
testing and then you know some testing
after that so so yeah I think it's
unlikely if we're hearing about a fall
deployment I think it's actually going
to happen into thin you know late fall
which which means that there's almost no
chance that so actually have pushed out
to devices this year and it would be a
shame if that bill a were to cause OEMs
to hold back on their their holiday
plans for windows phone 7 devices yeah
we need some new windows phone 7
hardware speaking of I mean it's been
it's been what I guess it's been it's
been about five months now almost six
months since since launch since since
devices actually started trickling out
and we haven't seen anything new yet
right and right now there then the dell
venue pro if you want to call that new
because it got delayed but what we need
is the development community to figure
out how to get Windows Phone 7 on say
the Xperia Arc or something I mean they
got it on the hd2 hopefully other
devices are to follow and then you know
it's a whole different ballgame for
those willing to do a little bit of
hackery yeah I think one of the problems
is that or one of the advantages i
should say the hd2 is it had the exact
same hardware almost as chassis one
requirements well you know you're going
to find that other phones they're going
to differ just a little bit and that
might be enough to make it impossible to
port the build over true true we're at
that gave about that very good well let
us move on to some Twitter questions
next week we're going to try to do
Collins so if you're listening and you
want to call in check out our Twitter
will make an announcement probably an
hour before the next podcast saying you
know call this line and we'll we'll take
your call on your questions so let's see
you've got a bunch of questions here
that have popped up in the last hour or
so
dude okay so a friend here this is from
John I don't know how to say this
john-boy NFL sounds like his name is
John Boy in from Florida a friend is
holding out for the droid bionic do you
have release info any other Android
device you would recommend can I take
the seven uh we don't have any release
info at all on the Bionic um there's a
lot of Android devices i would recommend
i guess if you're on verizon you know
you've got quite a few of these these 4g
phones coming out i'm sure that the
Thunderbolt would make you happy
although it's not a dual-core device
could wait for the LG revolution or the
samsung 4g LTE if you're not know
married to verizon there's quite a few
that are just coming out on eighteen t
like the infuse that's that's one that
I'm actually looking forward to the
infuse 4g yes can be great but right now
you know the Atrix 4G is just rolling
out you've got inspire 4g on sprint
you've got evo shift look II talking
about before even the the evo 4g is
still a solid phone so there's there's
quite a lot of good Android hardware out
there basically any of the top and
Android hardware on most of the carriers
I think you'll be happy with this is the
verizon 4g samsung phone going to be
dual core don't think so i don't think
so either because there's got to be
something that separates that from from
whatever the big galaxy s2 variant is
going to be on verizon and it's the same
thing with AT&amp;amp;T would the infused
usually does not dual core right and of
course the infused as a 4.5 inch screen
which is pretty pretty cool about 4.3
was big and so that begs the question
actually from these twitter follower
named gun sing which is the best android
phone out there right
and if you have to come to one answer if
you were going to buy one android phone
today what would it be I mean I have to
say you know I haven't I haven't even
played with all them so by specs alone
it's got to be tricks for G right now by
motorola but but I haven't used it so I
can't say with any certainty i haven't
tested any of the newest phones you know
and in depth at all pepto yeah i think
they're going to have to wait a couple
weeks if not a month for us to get some
reviews out and to be able to give a
little bit better answer on that yeah
we're on the eve of a lot of phone
releases so it's a it's a tough question
answer i would i would say stay away
from Tegra 2 I know people are going to
probably beat me up over this but I'd
say stay away from tech or two on
smartphones for now i don't i don't
think that the software is optimized i
don't think it's worth it and in fact
the tegra two smartphones i have played
with we're actually slower than you know
say the inspire 4G which has the latest
qualcomm snapdragon so the answer to
that question i would say if you had to
pick one the nexus s probably is is
still my favorite although this is a
kind of a bad time to make that choice
because we're on the as i said the eve
of a lot of foam releases yeah that'll
be that'll be a three carat or phone it
looks like a three carat yeah so you'll
have a high likelihood of it landing on
your or home carrier what would you say
is the best windows phone 7 right now
levin um they're all the same right now
just paying hmm probably the dell venue
pro or a lot of people like the
samsung's you know either the focus or
the omnia 7 yep what hasn't just what
hasn't been knocking people's socks off
it seemed so the htcs you know the
surround and the trophy Mozart hd7 I
guess the atom like the pro somewhat but
you know
it didn't blow it away so yeah I would
say you know dollar samsung is probably
the cops in that space right now I agree
with you and if I were to go either way
I'd say Samsung the the focus and the
omnia 7 seem to have better screen
sensitivity than really any of the other
windows phone 7 devices I think the dell
venue pro has fantastic build quality
great fit and finish but it's heavy and
unless you're someone that that requires
a hardware keyboard the on-screen
keyboard of the focus and the omnia 7 is
just fantastic so do you have a robot no
but I just wanted our listeners to know
that my avast virus says indeed been
updated the virus definitions I have to
hear that I'm sure everyone is the the
more viruses I have the slower that we
get the news oh that's your head cook
alright so one more question from Paris
Malaysia this is sort of a multi-pronged
question and we'll start off with you
Evan so basically best thing you let's
let me rephrase the thing you like most
about Windows Phone 7 iOS and Android
and the thing you dislike the most about
Windows Phone 7 android and iOS all
right well let me take them one at a
time windows phone 7 i would say what i
like most about it is um i like the fact
that they went in a new direction in
terms of the UI but i don't like the
fact that it seems like they pushed out
a product that wasn't ready yet and
there's there's just a ton of little
things that I don't like it like about
it a lot of it has to do with the home
screen and how it's not very
customizable and I'm moving around tiles
it's just an absolute nightmare they
they don't they don't really fly
properly when you move something around
it's it's really just a mess and here i
am i'm looking at done this sony
ericsson's um windows phone 7 is slider
and the screen looks terrible it's
one tile is light blue some of the other
tiles are like this like sort of faded
dark blue and then you've got a tile in
the middle it's multicolored it looks
awful so I'm not a big fan of that at
all um next up android i love the fact
that that android um feels a lot like
Windows Mobile did back in the day where
there's a lot of potential there's a lot
of customizability there's a ton of
software for it I'd say what I don't
like about Android is the sum of the
things that you've said before the
multitasking can be you know sort of a
double-edged sword and and I think we're
finding that that Android isn't
necessarily doing the best job of
managing some of the programs so that
you get a ton of stuff that's that's
running in the background a lot of
processes that don't necessarily need to
be and it slows things down but in
general you know it's a good solid OS
and iOS right now is the best operating
system out there in terms of polish that
it's what in its you know forth or if
you want to count the point lawns and
the point dudes it's much farther along
than that you know and it's six or 7th
generation and it really just does does
everything right now except for the fact
of course that that you're somewhat
locked down into you know apples
ecosystem and and the home screen is
still pretty uncool but but other than
that everything on the iphone basically
just works and that's that's ultimately
what you want is you know I'm gonna have
to be dinging around you know learning
you know how do I do this on my windows
phone 7 where can I where can I long put
long press and hold so so yeah I think
iOS definitely um did you the most
polish and the most features right now
but again I mean I was for a long time I
was a much bigger fan of Windows Mobile
that I was
of iOS so and it can change in a
heartbeat indeed my list isn't that that
different than yours for windows phone 7
and what I like about is actually what
you don't like about it is is the
interface I think the interface is
gorgeous it's fluid it's very smooth I
like the tiles it would be nice to have
more live tiles from the marketplace
there really aren't any I just like when
you click on the music application you
get a beautiful animation when you go
back to the home screen it's just butter
it is butta so I like that about one is
17 what I don't like about it is that
Microsoft knew that they had to change
the game and they sort of did they
brought something new to the table but
they left out some of the most important
things of a mobile operating system and
they'll argue you know the people were
going after don't care as much about
this as you do but I don't think that's
true there's no copy and paste there's
no fast app switching I'm not going to
go through the list because everyone's
heard it many many times before so they
wasted I mean Microsoft lost you know if
the rumors were here are right they lost
years literally they had to you know
they had their their windows mobile
seven and they dropped it and had to
retool it so yeah you know they could
have imagined if they'd had all those
people working all those years on on
what's become windows phone 7 yeah well
you know they made a mistake and they
they've owned up to that and and you
know we have something new and different
in it in its place let's talk about
Android what I like about it is it's its
versatility I find that any app I can
get on iOS I can also get on Android as
usually a similar quality so no longer
is Android lacking those major apps it's
just extremely versatile customizable
sort of in the windows mobile way but
the downside is the same downside that
Windows Mobile had things happen in the
background that you can't track down I
wrote a posts many weeks ago about how
suddenly the battery life on my inspire
4G became horrible and I couldn't track
it down I went through the quote what to
do when your Android battery life gets
bad
checklist over and over again I couldn't
find anything finally I did something
that I don't remember what I did and
it's fixed ok so it's unfortunate that
Android allows that to happen and
finally for iOS what I like about iOS is
the the hardware that it comes on i mean
the the iphone 4 is is gorgeous the
retina display is just unmatched in
terms of text readability I can read
books on my iPhone and have no I strain
because the letters are so crisp and
clear downside to the iphone is that
same same downside as you have and I
mean the software stagnant you still get
you turn on your phone you unlock and
all you see are icons and that is boring
and a waste of space you know that I
don't dumb I don't fill in the bottom
row of icons on my home on my main home
screen why so I think it looks better to
have that that space they're dividing
the the top three rows for me of icons
and then that bottom row along the dock
that never changes so you don't so you
keep the fourth real clear down there
right so I only have 12 plus for what
where most people have 16 plus 4 yeah
that's I actually do that on my android
it's kind of cool to to to get that
visual space and to also be able to see
the wallpaper more clearly yeah exactly
cool so thank you everybody who's
sending your Twitter questions again
next week we're going to attempt Collins
of course we are still relatively new at
podcasting so we're not sure how that's
going to go but I'm sure you know we'll
figure it out so that concludes episode
6 of the pocket now pocket cast and
thank you everyone for for listening
