pocket now calm and this is a tour of
the home screen set up on the samsung
captivate for AT&amp;amp;T Samsung has done some
really cool stuff to make Android
different here so let's get to it okay
so I'm going to turn on the device here
and we can unlock the screen by sliding
down or to the right I'm just going to
slide sort of diagonal there and here is
the home screen home screen number one
now there are a few things that you
should take note of number one is that
we have four docked icons on the bottom
that you unfortunately cannot change
phone email browser and applications
tapping on applications will bring you
to the application tray we'll talk more
about that in another video another cool
thing that Samsung has done is some work
to the notification bar so if we pull
down the notification bar we get these
for permanent buttons along the top that
let you switch on Wi-Fi Bluetooth silent
and vibrate mode very nice touch saves
you a lot of time and also is good for
power consumption so you can leave Wi-Fi
off if you know you're not going to be
using it without having to dig into the
settings menu another cool little touch
of the notification tray is that the but
the bottom of the tray doesn't actually
cover up the entire screen it sort of
just hovers just a nice little touch and
it bounces when you get to the bottom so
pretty cool pretty unique for this
particular Android device now you can
have up to seven home screens in the
coolest part about this is that you can
delete ones that you aren't using you
know an HTC Sense and other stock
Android devices you can't delete home
screens you have seven even if you use
three of them so what you can actually
do is hit the menu button here go to
edit we can actually add home screen so
you move to the place where you want a
new home screen say right here and boom
there's another home screen let's add
one over here there's another home
screen we can also delete the home
screens from here by just tapping on the
little delete button so let's go back
and now we will have four home screens
by the way which you can jump to very
easily with these dots along the top so
if I want to jump to the one on the left
I just quickly go like that I want to go
to the one on the right so really cool
and easy way to navigate through your
various home screens so let's talk about
the widgets that that Samsung
has added to these home screen so you
can customize them as it stands now I
just like to have a variety of programs
shortcuts here to keep the device
running as fast as possible I downloaded
this little clock widget from the market
as well as the battery widget from the
market because I like to have a granular
view of how much battery I have left so
I'm going to swipe to a blank home
screen and I'm going to add some widgets
here so you can tap and hold and by the
way you may have just seen that the
backgrounds actually a little bit
interactive if you tap on the bubbles
they will glow yellow pretty cool so
let's look at the samsung widgets we
have something called the buddies now
widget which is actually pretty cool
acts as a carousel and you can flip
through the people that you correspond
with the most often this is kind of out
of HTC sense I think and what you can do
is you can add new contacts or edit the
ones you have here let's delete this off
the screen and we go back to Samsung
widgets here's a calendar clock which is
just a sort of pocky way to see the
calendar in your next appointment you
can really quickly add a next
appointment by tapping on the plus
button there or you can jump into your
calendar by tapping on the date and
we're back to that home screen so let's
delete this so then we have daily
briefing which actually comes stock on
the device you don't have to actually
add this and what you do is you can see
the daily weather in your city your
stock quotes also the news and on the
bottom is your calendar so really cool
all-in-one widget that lets you see
what's going on in a given day we can do
the accuweather widget by the way
there's some really good on-screen
keyboard options on the samsung
captivate it as several and we'll talk
about that in the next video so it's
going to download the weather for
Philadelphia I could do likewise for
stocks and I could tap to get news from
AP mobile and there it is pretty cool
widget to have on one of your home
screen so let's go back and see the
other Samsung widgets we have days which
is just a calendar application we've
dual clock which lets you see the time
in two different cities good if you're
traveling feeds and updates is the
social networking widget I don't like
this too much because you always have to
update it or you can have an auto update
but then that uses battery but if you do
like having Twitter on your home screen
or Facebook this is a way
to do it so here is my Twitter and go to
settings change the auto refresh turn on
myspace or Twitter or Facebook from here
and let's go back and let's jump back to
that home screen okay we're almost
through the Samsung widgets there's one
more at the bottoms just yahoo finance
clock so this is kind of like the
calendar clock the calendar clock showed
your next appointment within a clock and
now you can see stock quotes within a
clock so if you're tracking stocks
really cool widgets use let's take a
look at the other ones that are here
we've the stock Android widgets you've
seen these before these 3 i've added you
can put facebook on here instant
messaging which it picture frame power
control i added twee droid you can go to
the android market and really download a
whole range of widgets and this is this
is pretty cool the weather channel
widget if you use the weather channel
application so i can move this up here
and drop it and it should be updating
and there it is shows me the weather
very very nice so the home screen setups
are very very nice on the samsung
captivate you get a lot of choices of
widgets of course it's Android you can
add as many as you want you can get more
from the market there's also some cool
live wallpaper that come on the
captivate so i'm going to go to
wallpaper and live wallpaper you just
saw the one blue sea which is just some
bubbles floating around this one's cool
aurora and it's actually also
interactive you can well you'll see in a
sec you can actually tap you get little
stars in the background kind of nice and
let me go to the other ones dandelion
pretty cool also interactive a little
bit more animated and potentially
annoying and uses a lot of battery but
you can tap on a dandy line and have the
seeds sort of fly out beyond that
there's one more live wallpaper that
comes from Samsung it's called
luminescence this is the most busy one
by far looks like you're at a disco but
you can tap off on the background and it
sort of moves the light around so kind
of cool but the sake of conserving
battery I think a good old standard
plain wallpaper like this does uh does
quite well so overall the home screens
on the samsung captivate are quite nice
I like how you can add up to seven but
if you don't want seven you only want
two or one you can delete home screens
very unique to Android I also like the
icon dock down here though I wish it was
customizable and it's pretty cool that
Samsung through in these quick way to
turn off bluetooth Wi-Fi and change the
phone mode because a lot of phones make
you dig through a variety of settings to
get to it Samsung has put it right out
here so if you liked the video please
give it a thumbs up coming up soon we're
going to dig a little bit deeper into
the captivate talk about the web
browsing experience compared to other
devices and also this application tray
