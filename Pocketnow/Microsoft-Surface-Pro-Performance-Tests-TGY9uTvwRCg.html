the fastest tablets out there this is
Adam Lane from pocketnow.com
and in this video I want to take it
through some performance tests things
like Photoshop Premiere Pro a couple
couple games and of course the web
browser so let's check it out
alright we're gonna start by booting up
I'm just gonna turn these two on at the
same time and we're starting so this is
a completely shut off and we'll see how
long it takes
oh and let's put my password in and
there we are so we see our performance
it's going pretty good
let's hey there let's go to the browser
here's the Peacekeeper Universal browser
test and you see I already ran it so the
score is 6 6 3 and that's okay it's not
a awesome score I 10 lost a lot of
points because of some of the codecs
were missing and whatnot so let's go to
a different site have a pocket now see
how quickly that loads and we're pretty
much there and very little no lag at all
how about that we see a load pretty
quickly
I'm gonna play that oops
and I'm zooming while watching video and
we're not missing a beat there so that's
the browser pretty pretty high
performance there if you want more html5
support obviously this is Windows 8 so
you can install whatever browser you
feel like this is the Premiere Pro 5
benchmark you cannot get your own copy
it PP bm5 comm a lot of people use this
to measure their response times for
different computers i've already ran the
test the rendering speed tests and i
wrote down the answers over here so the
h.264 test is about 5 minutes 49 seconds
the disc test is 2.2 minutes 11 seconds
and the mpeg-2 DVD test is 7 minutes and
12 seconds so it's not super fast but I
think it's pretty acceptable so there's
a premiere let's do Photoshop next so
we'll see how quickly that lunches and
we're right there I'm going to open a
file which one was it test image see how
quickly that goes there you go and I
have a speed test this is a Photoshop
speed test I will show you the place
where you can get it Club of 1.com slash
speed test and we're gonna play it but I
need to stop watch
so a little over a minute that's your
speed test for a Photoshop so those are
not excellent results but they're pretty
good especially considering this is such
a small thin little tablet next let's
try game I was told that this game is a
really good one
there we go this is running at 1080p so
say yeah full resolution at the screen
may have seen a little bit of choppiness
there but it's still going pretty
smoothly out you just saw a little
choppiness there too so there we're
moving around see it's doing pretty
nicely I think where's my guy a little
bit of choppiness there alright so I
think that's working pretty nicely now
let's try a regular tablet kind of game
not with this one
we'll see how this performs
all right here we go
okay thanks button all right here we go
looking pretty nice
see some water splash on the screen who
can do that
there you go
lastly let's just see now how many RAW
files we can you know how quickly we can
open a bunch of raw files so let's see
how many should I take about that many
and I'm just going to hit that we're
going to open them and that was pretty
quick so now I can select them all and I
can do all sorts of alterations on all
the pictures at one time and it happens
all very very quickly just for house
let's open up a photo shop and see how
quickly that happens and we got a little
wait cursor there these are all 16
megapixels
I believe the file sizes are around 13
Meg each so this is a quite acceptable
performance
and I can do other stuff while I wait
and we can see what's going on in the
little thumbnail over there while I look
at some webpages you saw it change more
our opening so pretty cool so that whole
video that you just watched it's
actually the first time that I edited an
HD video on the surface pro so all I had
to do is a copy of the videos straight
to the USB port here and now start
editing right away there's a very smooth
and quick so that's it for the
performance tests on the surface pro be
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
that's it for now
