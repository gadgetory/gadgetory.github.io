polycarbonate and glass and they both
have fancy names for the cameras ultra
pixel PureView one runs Android the
other one runs Windows Phone eight so
let's see how they compare if you want
to know every detail on aspect of the
HTC One make sure to check out our full
review in case you missed it this
version right here is the international
flavor of the HTC one just like the
Nokia Lumia 925 which will make its way
to t-mobile in the US hopefully soon we
have also just recently compared the
Lumia 925 with the octa-core Samsung
Galaxy s4 and now it's time to put it
against HTC's 2013 flagship this
comparison will focus on the following
hardware software and user experience as
well as camera the Nokia Lumia 925 is a
breath of fresh air with a design which
is both old and new Nokia windows film
fans will instantly recognize this as a
Lumia device but the company made some
welcome tweaks it is no longer the tank
the Lumia 920 was instead it's more
refined and the combination of aluminum
and soft touch polycarbonate resulting a
great in-hand feel once you get used to
the fairly square shape the HTC One on
the other hand is something completely
new to the untrained eye it might look
somewhat like the iPhone 5 or the
BlackBerry z10 but it feels
exceptionally in the hand the full
aluminum body is cold to the touch at
first and the tapered edges are
complemented nicely by the slight curve
on the back that feels your palm when
you hold it because of the slightly more
curved design on the edges the HTC One
feels really good but the Lumia 925 has
that certain genetic walk which makes
you fall in love with it more and more
every day as you're getting used to the
squared shape looking at the specs
requires us to understand the basic OS
principles and the relationship between
them and the horsepower needed when this
film was built in such a way that it
just like iOS simply needs less specs to
deliver a fluid user experience the
Lumia 925 is powered by a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor clocked at
1.5 gigahertz
helped by 1 gig of ram it has 16
gigabytes of internal storage with no
expansion options Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC
and a non-removable 2000 milliamp hour
battery the entire front part is Gorilla
Glass 2 under which Nakia packed a 4
when five inch peer motion HD + clear
back display with 768 by 1280 resolution
for a PPI rating of 332 the camera is
pure view version 2 at 8.7 megapixels
with carl zeiss lens
coupled with a 1.3 megapixel front
fascia the HTC One is powered by the
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor clocked at one point seven
Hertz there are two gigs of RAM and this
unit is the 32 gigabyte flavor
non-expandable sensors include Bluetooth
Wi-Fi NFC and an IR blaster alongside a
non removable 2300 million power battery
on the front there's a 4.7 inch Super
LCD 3 screen a Full HD resolution and
the PPI rating of 469 the camera is a 4
megapixel air quotes ultra pixel unit
and it has a 2.1 megapixel webcam
correspondent on the front
oh and boomsound offers the best speaker
and loudspeaker experience we have ever
heard on a mobile device ever it is
really difficult to choose the best
display among the two the Lumia 925
being an AMOLED screen has really
popping colors and shoe blacks while the
HTC One has a very natural realistic
color reproduction with somewhat less
pronounced blacks if we factor in
exceptional outdoor visibility for both
of these the choice becomes even more
difficult we'll have to give it to the
HTC One because of its true-to-life
colors better side viewing angles and
higher resolution looking at the
software and user experience of an
Android phone compared to a Windows
Phone is always difficult since each of
the two platforms is everything the
other one is not Sense 5 nicely
complements the user experience on
Android that's not to say that the stock
Android UX is lacking we're not talking
about skinning Android here sense 5 is
so much more the live picture gallery
the ability of snapping Zoe's video
highlights Beats Audio blinkfeed
are all part of the HTC experience of
course there will be a Google Edition
phone but the one is a real one because
of Sense 5 Windows Phone on the Lumia
925 still looks fresh different live
tiles flipping on your homescreen bring
your phone to life and keep you up to
date with what's important the hubs
nicely gather all the information you
need in a single place and on an
exceptional screen like the one on the
Lumia
25 everything seems to float on the
absolute black background similar to HTC
Sense 5 on the one Nakia is both filling
in the OS gaps and offers additional
user experience elements the here shoot
Nakia music the camera and add-on
applications are all great steroids for
Windows Phone on the Lumia 925 but as
always there's the ecosystem question
always a debate will insert the usual
disclaimer here before purchasing any of
these phones make sure to research the
ecosystem and what each has to offer
both in terms of software titles and
services the camera on the Lumia 925 is
a peer review camera no not the stage
one per view on the 808 with version 2
the low-light sensitivity and optical
image stabilization peer review from the
Lumia 920 there's an 8 point 7 megapixel
sensor coupled with carl zeiss lens
nokia threw in a 6 lines in addition to
the camera construction of the 920 to
make pictures look even better the
viewfinder on Windows Phone is so
minimalistic that it is missing any
indicators that you're shooting in a
special mode luckily it reversed the
default upon launching it again so you
don't miss a shot because of previous
settings or modes there is however
support for lenses no not physical
lenses but software lenses add-ons for
the camera that improve functionality
nokia bundled its own Nakia smart cam
which assists you in taking special
shots like best shot
action shot motion blur best face and
the ability to remove unwanted objects
on top of everything there's always the
dedicated shutter release button which
is April requisite on Windows Phones
unfortunately a very rare option on
other devices the HTC one's viewfinder
is packed with options from live effects
to custom modes and you always know
which mode you're in because of the
graphical representation on the screen
just like on the Lumia 925 with the
nokia smart cam HTC can deliver a
cornucopia of shooting modes through
Zoe's shooting consecutive frames allows
the user to do everything that the Lumia
925 user can and more for an in-depth
look at the camera features on the HTC
one make sure to read our full review as
well as watch our HTC One special camera
and gallery video we will compare camera
quality between these two phones and
others in an upcoming dedicated camera
oriented shootout so make sure to
subscribe to our social media channel
so you don't miss it but you came here
for a comparison and what would a
comparison be without sample images so
here they are in bright sunny outdoors
they both deliver exceptional results
the Lumia 925 delivers superior pictures
though
despite the ultra pixel camera that is
supposed to take more light and than any
other shooter the one is no match for
the Lumia 925 in low-light poorly lit
situations exceptional sensitivity and
optical image stabilization result in a
far superior low-light experience the
Lumia 925 simply loves the dark wear
itself starts to shine to wrap
everything up there is no real winner
here aside from the user you can't go
wrong with either of these two phones
they're both exceptionally designed and
built and are a joy to use however
you'll have to consider that the Lumia
925 s camera is slightly superior to the
camera on the HTC One by all means not a
bad camera this one which could have
been better in some aspects that plus
your choice of Windows Phone versus
Android which is a choice only you can
make based on your personal preference
and needs everyone that's gonna do it
for today for HTC One versus Nakia Lumia
925 video a benign sandy nut you can
follow me on Facebook as well as on
Twitter stay tuned to pocket now we have
more coming on the Lumia 925 including
the full review sometime this week so
stay tuned for that if you've liked this
video please give us a thumbs up thank

time
