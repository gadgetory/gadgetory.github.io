my last video I showed you the hardware
of the Samsung Galaxy S series phone
from Sprint called the epic 4G and I
just showed you hardware I did that
specifically for a reason than that so
you wouldn't be dazzled by the software
so that's what we've got in today's
video let's go right to it
okay so this is the home screen of the
Samsung Epic 4G what you're gonna notice
first and foremost is right after you
boot up your phone you're gonna see this
screen you're not gonna go through the
typical Android setup process now that
Android setup process is the one where
you have a little Android guy on the
screen says touch the Android to begin
and it sets up your Google Account some
Google services you don't have that on
this phone instead you have your home
screen if you want to set up your Google
services you tap on one of the google
apps like the market which is right here
on the main home screen or the center
home screen and that will ask you for
your username and password very simple
very elegant and lets you start using
your phone right away I kind of like
this approach and I think that other
other service providers other carriers
you're gonna start doing something like
this let's get right into this this is
the TouchWiz UI it's not the stock
Android interface as you can see there
are a couple things to show you first of
all your app drawer is over on the side
it kind of has this little tabbed
display to show you that you are in your
apps I'm actually in the third page now
you'll notice this is a sidescroller
rather than an up-and-down scroller
and it has these little dots at the top
of the screen to show you which page
you're on it's kind of nice because you
can say okay I'm right here in the
middle I'm over on the side and it's got
this neat little elastic bounce to let
you know this is as far as you can go
back on the home screen you'll notice
those dots across the top again there
are seven screens in this case and
moving between them is fairly easy using
the dots or accidentally tapping on the
Google search box or simply swiping
across now one thing that I've done is I
have replaced the stock wallpaper with
one of my favorites this is beautiful
beautiful live weather wallpaper what it
comes with and let me switch back to it
really fast is this really really pretty
delicate arch wallpaper
now delicate arches in southern Utah I
mean you
so it's kind of homey but this is not a
live wallpaper this is just a static
wallpaper which is kind of unusual
seeing how we ran an article not long
ago on how to get all of these beautiful
samsung live wallpapers from the
captivate and vibrant over onto your
Android powered phone including
dandelion galaxy this luminous ocean
waves they're just really cool they're
they're beautiful why didn't the phone
come with them pre-installed in stock
well it's all about battery life and
I'll show you that in just a minute for
the meantime we'll leave it right where
it is one other thing I'd like to
mention this back button in fact all of
these buttons on the bottom are a bit
finicky you're going to have to tap at
them a couple times especially if they
turn off before you're ready to press
them now I've made some modifications to
keep these on a little bit longer
because when the backlight goes off you
can't see them at all now that's
beautiful when looking at the blank
screen but not Mary user-friendly when
trying to navigate on the device we'll
leave that as it is let's get right into
the apps that come on the phone sprint
zone is the first one and this is kind
of an all-in-one everything I need to
know about my sprint account including
my account how to find a store and this
I need help section which is really cool
you'll notice up at the top there's a
diagnostic ongoing right now
that's testing the voice and data
connections and it gives you all of this
information right there on the phone so
you can give that to whoever the support
technician is let's go back you've got
some Sprint news what can you do with 4G
we'll talk about that in a minute and
some suggested apps including what's
already installed phone tips and tricks
and some more stuff so let's go back and
look at what other apps are installed
first and foremost ESPN and CNN these
you might think our apps but they're not
they're just shortcuts to the mobile
version of the website which isn't a bad
thing but that means that anybody with
an Android can put these shortcuts on
their home screen and get that same
effect over here you've got one of
Samsung's many really cool apps
it's a widget that sits on top of the
TouchWiz UI
kind of like the HTC Sense widgets this
one is a buddy's widget and see if we
can find somebody that we want to put in
here we'll put in Anton case he's a nice
guy and we will put in
let's see another picture down here I've
got way too many contacts in my phone as
you can tell let's put in Brandon now
you'll notice I've got kind of a Rolodex
thing going on it's very nice very fluid
and I can see who this person is just at
a glance I can send them a text I can
call them or using this edit button I
can remove them from this widget now
this only lets you change the person it
doesn't let you change the details of
the person I'd like to be able to go in
and edit that person's details right
from that screen and you can see they're
the back button was being a bit finicky
again but we'll say done on that so
that's one of the cool widgets another
widget let me scroll all the way over to
the other side this is the feeds and
updates widget which ties in with the
Facebook MySpace and Twitter feeds that
you set up on the phone and it's a
scrollable widget which isn't something
you get from stock Android widgets you
only get those in the more advanced
launchers such as a TW launcher launcher
pro sense UI of course and now TouchWiz
but this gives you everything that's
going on in your social circle all at a
glance and you can tell the service that
it's on in this case these are all
twitter and there we passed a Facebook
right there so kind of cool there are a
few others this is a task manager widget
that comes with the phone and I'm kind
of disappointed about that Android does
really good monitoring and managing all
of the running apps here you can see
I've got five things running voice
search market Gmail feeder and browser
and I can end them all so let's go ahead
and do that now
Android takes care of all that memory
management for you and I think it does a
pretty good job I've never needed to
have a task killer if you will on my
Nexus One I don't think it's really
necessary on the Samsung I think it was
just included because
people were asking for it so that having
been said let's look at some other
widgets these are the Samsung widgets
that come with it
and AccuWeather clock we would we've
seen all of these on the other Galaxy S
cell phone so I'm just gonna browse over
them really quickly but it's now which I
showed you the calendar clock feeds and
updates which I showed you program
monitor which I just showed you in the
Yahoo Finance clock so lots of cool ways
to get information that just kind of
really quickly and again that back
button is just a bit finicky for my for
my likes now let's go into Samsung Apps
first and foremost sprint football
because who doesn't like football and
for everyone else in the rest of the
world football for us is an oblong ball
it's not a soccer ball so that's just
what we call it in America sorry about
the confusion this of course is divided
into pro and college and gives you all
kinds of stuff you can stop your
favorite team it gives you scores and
schedules news analytics statistics
standings team pages Twitter lots of
cool stuff including odds so you can
fuel you're betting addiction right
there getting the odds one thing that's
interesting about this app and one of
the other apps is it makes you update
immediately on launch now I don't know
if that was just me or if they put kind
of a shell of the app on the phone and
then force the download the first time
but it was kind of kind of a
disappointing experience that I had to
go through and get an update before I
could even run my app I would have liked
to see an update happen in the
background one other thing you can't see
it because I've already pre-loaded the
data on this that little helmet right in
the middle is the busy indicator it's
not the standard Android busy indicator
and it's kind of distracting and I'd
like things to be more consistent across
the UI and it's not that having been
said it does what it's supposed to do
let's skip sprint navigation for a
minute and go into NASCAR NASCAR does
the same thing as the football app and
it reloads the update to the app and
then it brings you right in very similar
to the football app I've already
selected my favorite driver this is Tony
Stewart and I get all of these things
related to him
point standings of him along with his
other drivers or other drivers in that
the circuit that is and just a bunch of
other data some videos you know we can
go into details on these apps at some
other time
sprint navigation we need to hit on this
is Sprint's version of Google Maps
Navigation and it's kind of interesting
you'll notice again a non-standard busy
indicator but there is a nice progress
bar to let you know that it's logging in
now why does it take that long I don't
know if I'm looking for directions I
want to get them quickly and get on the
road and go I don't want to have to wait
and wait and wait and wait while it's
loading I don't know why they do it I
think they need to improve that here
we've got the basics we can drive to a
location we can search for a location
we've got maps in traffic and share and
more let's go ahead and look at maps and
traffic went through to the wrong one
and in maps and traffic this is where I
am just very basic very simple
it's from TeleNav telling Atlas so it
looks just like the maps that you're
familiar with you'll notice it's a bit
slow in loading now we're gonna go away
from apps for just a minute and talk
about Sprint's 3G and 4G when I was
doing my FCC Broadband Tess sprint 3G
performed at right around 300 sometimes
up to 400 kilobits per second that's not
all that great I mean it's not bad but
it's not great my t-mobile at the same
location is going to get me anywhere
from 6 to 900 kilobits per second but
the thing that kills me is Sprint's
Lattin see the amount of time that it
takes for you to ask for something and
get a response back on the internet is
somewhere around the five to six
hundreds on Sprint where it's usually
below 200 on t-mobile which is really
where it should be I'm kind of
disappointed in that with sprint sprint
advertises having such a fast network
now you'll also notice up at the top
my 4G is grayed out because I don't have
4G at my location when I did get under a
4G umbrella you can see that screen turn
off
I'll talk about that in just a moment
too when you get under a 4G umbrella the
speeds are astoundingly fast we're
talking loading up YouTube videos and
playing them almost instantaneously
we're in the FCC app right around five
megabit per second down about one and a
half megabit per second up the Latin
sees however are still high I don't
understand why they came down a bit but
they were in the mid to high 300s
I think Sprint really has to work on
that but anyway this is the tella Atlas
the sprit navigation let's go back now
again that back button being finicky it
asks us if we want to exit and yes we do
it does that so it doesn't eat up
battery life Sprint TV turn it this way
this could be Sprint's killer app and
you can see I've been using this all
morning and I have drained my battery
down this could be the killer app
unfortunately it's not the reason being
there are several first and foremost if
you're on Wi-Fi because you don't have a
good sprint signal at home say you're
like me and don't have Wi-Fi or excuse
me don't have 4G at your house you want
to use your houses Wi-Fi maybe you don't
even have 3G or good 3G at your house
you have to turn off Wi-Fi to be able to
use this app now I'm sure that Sprint's
way of locking down this app so people
don't rip it out and use it on other non
sprint devices but it's very
disappointing that I can't use my
high-speed Internet to watch my very
bandwidth intensive shows let's go ahead
and dive in we're gonna look at all
channels now the first thing you're
gonna notice is there's not an awful lot
of channels here I mean there are
several but there's not a ton we just
scrolled through the list
what twice that's all you've got let's
go ahead and look at well first of all
there's free stuff and there's not free
stuff the not free stuff becomes just
like cable TV where you can go through
and buy a package in this case for ten
bucks a month plus taxes you can get all
of these channels which is a pretty good
deal this could let you turn off your
cable TV your
satellite TV or whatnot and stream it
all to your phone now where that is
really advantageous is with this phone
you can actually hook it up to your TV
and watch it on your big-screen TV that
becomes a problem and I'll show you here
let's go into the Disney Channel this is
what my nine-year-old daughter found
right away and she loved it because she
had Hannah Montana now in here we've got
Hannah Montana full episodes well that's
to differentiate them from the not full
episodes which are just clips and the
clips are a pain in the neck you get
involved and you think this is the show
I want to watch but it's just a
two-minute clip of the show so it's kind
of painful they've separated that by
annotating full episodes I really wish
you had a top level navigation or a
setting that said look I don't want to
see clips I just want full episodes but
that's just a feature request that I
like let's go ahead and open up this if
we can tap on that will open up this
episode and I'm just gonna show you a
little bit you'll notice it's taking a
little while to load again because I'm
on 3G unfortunate faster now my viewable
screen area is from that corner to that
corner but the TV is only that big to
that big so there's a lot of space
missing you'll also see here that this
is the actual resolution of of the video
that's playing and I'm getting
distracted by the video that's playing
here so we're gonna go ahead and zoom
back out again and then we'll navigate
away from Hannah Montana but it's
nowhere near high-def if you plug this
into your big-screen TV you're not going
to be happy with the quality especially
with it being over a slower 3G
connection so sprint needs to up that
again this could be the killer app but
it's not this isn't organized all that
well it does let you it kind of learns
your favorites and it puts those all
together so that you can go back and
watch them after you've found what you
want several times you know you can go
back in there and see what you're
looking for quickly so that's kind of
cool and that's in the recommended
section up there again this back buttons
acting up there's some other stuff
radios favorites and
more but that's pretty much the app so
all in all the apps on the phone aren't
bad they're not great if you're buying
this phone just for the apps go ahead
and pass get tv.com from the market
which is free it gives you nearly the
same offerings as Sprint TV not quite
then it doesn't give you the premium
channels like sprit TV does but if you
want to get free stuff there you go TV
common folder Schlow sure does also have
the problem with showing clips rather
than full episodes so that's still a
frustration and that recommendation goes
out to them too I mentioned I was going
to tell you about battery and that's the
last thing that we're gonna cover we
come in here and look at settings and
we'll rotate the screen really quick the
display has some interesting things set
up for it let me get down to it
brightness is automatic so there is an
ambient light sensor that adjusts the
brightness of the screen and it does
this perfectly it it's amazing I've not
noticed a problem like I do with the
Nexus One where you can actually see the
screen getting brighter or getting
dimmer it's always nice bright and
visible indoors outdoors anywhere you
want it's gorgeous
you'll also notice they changed the
Android stock user interface here for
this nice blue which is nice it looks
good the fonts are a bit bigger I don't
think they needed to do that but they've
set themselves apart from everybody else
down here is the power saving mode this
is checked by default and it gives you
the option to save power by having
having the OS basically analyze what's
being displayed on the screen and adjust
the LCD brightness not just for the
ambient light but for what's being
displayed on the screen they're really
concerned about power saving on this
phone and with good reason
this display is very large it's very
bright and it chews up a lot of battery
life sorry
off-camera there for a minute but what
you see is I've gone ahead and dug into
the about this phone a battery status
and just as we'd expect the display took
up 74% of everything since we have
unplugged the phone Sprint navigation
the short amount of time that we had an
open and chewed up an enormous 13%
whereas the Android system cell phone
standby the live wallpaper Bluetooth
Android core apps took up just hardly
any in comparison to that display so
they're doing everything they can with
the display to keep the battery life
reasonable in fact the timeout for the
screen is 30 seconds by default and of
course I had to change that to shoot
this video otherwise I'd be constantly
turning it on and off and on and off so
they've done a lot to change it so that
you can have a more battery life so
let's talk about real-world battery life
in the mornings I get up I read my email
I read my feeder feeds I eat breakfast I
do some other reading in that nook or in
Kindle I get in my car I listen to a
couple podcasts on my way to work at
work I'm back to emails answering
several phone calls and doing that you
know surfing a few web pages watching a
few YouTube videos work-related of
course when I do that it's not bad I
have in fact I did that and showing it
off to my friends yesterday I ran to
about two o'clock so that's not bad 7:00
in the morning to two o'clock in the
afternoon before I needed a charge was
actually pretty good
I had to plug it in at that point now if
I hadn't been showing off to all my
friends it would have lasted me through
the whole day and I could have plugged
in on the commute on the way home your
mileage may vary of course and I've just
got to put this out up front the first
two three days that you have this phone
you're going to think that this has the
worst battery in the world even though
it's a 1500 milliamp battery you're
gonna think it's terrible be patient the
reason you're gonna think it's terrible
is because you're going to be installing
lots of apps populating a lot of data
you're going to be using the heck out of
this phone and it's going to be very
data and screen intense it's not your
normal average use so wait till the
novelty wears off and then start judging
the battery and I think you'll be
relatively pleased I'd still recommend a
mid
they charge or charging on the commute
to and from work
but other than that it's great watching
TV even watching that sprint TV my
daughter was able to do it on the couch
for a good two three hours before we got
a low-battery notification so all in all
the phones really great if you don't
like the TouchWiz UI you can actually
install another home launcher and that
will give you this chooser here so you
can go back to the stock Android 2.1
homescreen which is kind of nice I like
launcher pearl and I put that on here
just to test it out and make it look
like mine you can see I've gone into
battery SOS mode where it's dimmed a
whole bunch of stuff turned off 4G so
it's trying to save as much battery
giving me as much extra life as I can if
you don't like TouchWiz this is the way
to get rid of it you will still have the
new notification drop-down that gives
you quick access to turn on and off your
radios which is really nice but again in
summary it's a good phone the software
that comes on it is you know it's sprint
stuff so just kind of live with it or
don't use it or replace it with whatever
you want don't buy the phone because of
the software by the phone because it's
gorgeous because it's fast because it's
got a cool slide-out keyboard because
it's got this neat slide to unlock thing
and that I do like by the phone because
your sprint user and you want a really
fast really nice Android phone because
this is it it's amazing for software
this I'm going to divide my software
review into two parts the first part is
the sprint apps
sorry sprint you're only getting one out
of five for reasons that we mentioned
for the Android stuff and the Samsung
stuff for out of five okay
so there you go this sprint Samsung Epic
4G Galaxy S Android phone very beautiful
hardware especially that screen and the
slide-out keyboard the software Samsung
stuff really really nice the TouchWiz UI
rather than the stock Android launcher
does its job does it well I still kind
of lean towards the stock Android
launcher type apps but TouchWiz UI is a
nice fluid feel especially with some of
those Samsung widgets that you can put
on your home screens the Sprint apps not
so much if you're looking at this phone
and saying I want to get a an Android
phone because of the Sprint apps that
come on it don't do that just for the
apps they've got a lot of room to grow
in fact one thing I didn't tell you
about was a couple of those sprint apps
that I showed you don't even run on
sprint 4G you have to drop down to
sprint 3G to be able to use them and of
course they don't work over your Wi-Fi
network or the local Wi-Fi at Starbucks
or McDonald's or wherever you may be so
