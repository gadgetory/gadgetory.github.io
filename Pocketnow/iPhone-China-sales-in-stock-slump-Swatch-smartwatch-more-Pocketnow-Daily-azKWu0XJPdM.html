claiming that iphone still sell in China
leaks of a huawei nexus shovel isn't in
the same camera and swatches CEO takes a
stab at the Apple watch I'm hi meri
behna and is it just me or does the
swatch CEO seem like if he's doing
another gesture this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
Microsoft and Cortana for Android as up
yeah the public beta is out today you
may get it but yeah it's a public beta
and still work in progress most of the
services are working in it does even
include that cool home button
integration but sadly if you want to go
to try you have to be in the United
States I think perfect other official
news have apple and pretty much every
other companies struggling with their
stock price because well there was a
major slump today it's all over the news
but even more interesting tip just came
on record to confirm that even with the
stock plunge even with the situation
being part speculation from China he
confirmed that Apple still sells like
crazy in China and he foresees even more
growth coming soon so yeah let's see how
that stock slump handles itself tomorrow
now let's begin going through the league
starting with the Huawei Nexus we saw
some renders earlier that looked okay
but this time we've got leaks and photos
of the device with a terrible humongous
camera hump kind of reminds us of the
old droid razr which wasn't necessarily
bad looking weak just trying to
understand what the whole purpose of the
hump is if not because the phone is
extremely thin which is not something
that we see in the leaks so let's just
see what we get in let's hope we get it
to other leaks have an HTC a 9 flagship
device in the works we know that the
company is desperate for a comeback and
yeah the back looks a lot like an iPhone
6 but forget about the design what's
most important are the internals barely
this device will launch with that new
MediaTek Helio x 20 decker core
processor so it's apparently going to be
a powerhouse of a device let's just see
when it launches and let's just hope
that it'll be as hot as it looks in the
leaks
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day we've heard sac warrior
and fossil working on an Android wear a
SmartWatch but we also heard that swatch
wanted to do their own thing something
of their own operating system or
whatever that because last four years or
days or months not really sure but that
it won't require a recharge and we've
seen that with kizito not to gracefully
but anyways the point here is that the
company CEO Nick haic just came on
record he's this the Apple watch saying
that it's an interesting toy that can't
last for more than a day which is true
and that his SmartWatch will bring some
cool features like NFC payments which we
already have but even more interesting
is that it won't include fitness
tracking because that's a major concern
for security according to him which is
extremely interesting it does lead me to
the question of today is fitness
tracking on a SmartWatch important to
you even if they figured out battery
life with this be a deal-breaker for you
because in my case it would be but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
