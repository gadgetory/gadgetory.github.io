IFA 2012 to happen in Berlin our own
Michael and Tony are both going to be
there to cover everything live as it
happens but let's start talking about it
hello everyone I'm Jaime from pocket now
and let's go through our top 5
predictions of what's going to happen in
Berlin for IFA 2012 number 5 is Windows
Phone 8 hardware even though I'm not
going to be holding my breath for this
one the only reason we mention it this
year is because well last year we got
the radar and the Titan from HTC but I'm
not really going to be expecting for
much to happen for Windows Phone and
this event we have a no given that's
happening almost at the same time that's
probably going to release some hardware
but then again we're not sure if
Microsoft and other partners are going
to be doing something at IFA hopefully
that's going to be the case let's see
what happens hey number for you guessed
it Windows RT hardware now that we're
covering tablets upset part about
Microsoft's way to launch stuff is
obviously not having any hardware to see
it on except for the surface and well
we've got the slated launch for the end
of October and we're hoping that IFA is
going to serve some hardware we ms to be
launching their products within the same
timeline as Windows RT happens so that
the surface won't get them as a
competitor hopefully that's going to be
the case though sadly we haven't been
seeing that much adoption of Windows RT
from other OEM so it could be the case
that we get it it could be the case that
we don't so again time will tell number
three is upgraded hardware we have been
seeing rumors of an HTC one x+ hopefully
that'll be the case two gigabytes of RAM
a better processor and hopefully Android
4.1 jelly bean on what we would probably
call sense 4.2 hopefully that's going to
be the case though we're still not sure
about that we could probably be also
getting android 4.1 jelly bean on other
devices that are currently in the market
probably get the announcement at IFA
parallel to these devices being launched
we were thinking about Sony but we
already got the sony xperia SL launched
silently and probably a samsung galaxy
s3 with two gigabytes of ram
internationally just as we see in the LT
variants in the United States that's
probably going to be the case not sure
we're going to be hearing much from any
other manufacturer
gems in the market but it would be cool
if we got more Android 4.1 jelly bean
and not the case that we got with some
devices in mwc where we got gingerbread
when ice cream sandwich was pretty much
the mainstream already now one of our
biggest bets for IFA 2012 is number two
jellybean tablets we were very
disappointed at mwc 2012 and also at CES
where we were expecting more tablets and
sadly we didn't get many honeycomb
wasn't really that good an Ice Cream
Sandwich was there but not variant
jellybean is a whole different story and
the Nexus 7 has taught everybody how you
can ship a really good quad-core tablet
at a very same price there's a new
Kindle Fire coming to the market and the
Nexus 7 is generating a lot of
disruption in the market already so
hopefully this will be the case where we
will be getting a new HTC tablet
hopefully probably more tablets from
Samsung we already got enough but that
probably will be the case and hopefully
we will be getting more tablets from
masseuse or upgrades the jellybean for
some really good tablets in the market
like the transformer lineup hopefully
that's the case again we are hoping not
to be disappointed in tablets but
anything can happen now the number one
spot was taken by two devices and you'll
understand why first of all we've got
these recent leaks and rumors of an lg
optimus G being teased and apparently
this device will have a unique display
never seen in the market LT is very
famous for their displays on the iPad
and also on some generations of the
iphone so hopefully that'll be the case
that they're planning to change
everything with this new super phone
that'll be the case I'll see you that
because this year we've got a lot of LG
devices being launched none of them were
good and sadly a lot of them took a long
time to be launched but the next device
is well we've got an unpacked event from
Samsung happening in Berlin on the 29th
and we know this is going to be the
event for the samsung galaxy note 2 if
that's the way they're going to call it
hopefully samson's going to bring
something different to the table because
phablets are cool but they're getting
too big I mean it really would be cool
if they figured out a way to get rid of
all the bezel around the screen and just
bring this ginormous screen for
everybody to use and make it device
smaller even though it's still a phablet
that'll be the case but again this will
probably be one of the coolest products
being launched we were not really
thinking that the note will be as
popular as it
but everybody's enjoying it so I guess
that's a new market that everybody wants
so hopefully that'll be the number one
thing that will be launched at IFA okay
that's it for today's top five thank you
