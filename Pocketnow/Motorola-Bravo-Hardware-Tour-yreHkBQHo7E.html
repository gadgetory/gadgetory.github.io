pakka calm and this is the hardware tour
of the motorola Bravo mb 520 so let's
get started so the first thing you'll
probably know this is a rather large
screen in proportion to the bezel and
this is a 3.7 inch LCD TFT display with
a glass coated capacitive multi-touch
input so the screen resolution is FWVGA
that's 480 pixels across x 854 pixels in
height the dimensions of the device are
63 millimeters in width 109.5
millimeters in height and 13.3
millimeters in depth so rather small
android 2.1 device here it feels really
great in hand wish you could feel it
yourself we also have this rubber
coating on the back and sides to help
prevent slipping out of your hand so on
the top we have an LED notification that
you can see right here it's green we
also have the light and proximity
sensors we have the speaker and a
motorola emblem on the bottom we have
these three capacitive buttons we're
seeing that a lot of newer devices are
doing away with a search button which I
guess makes sense because I personally
never be used it I don't know about you
we also have a microphone on the bottom
on the top of the device we have these
power on and standby button we have a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack that also
doubles as an antenna when you plug in a
set of headphones on this side of the
device we have the micro USB sync
charging port on the bottom we don't
really have anything except for that
microphone right there on this side we
have our volume rocker and on the back
we have this rubberized coating along
with our speaker it almost looks are sir
i guess i should say speaker phone
speaker or media speaker it almost looks
like a finger nail tab to help get the
battery cover off but the battery cover
slides up Mel show you that in just a
second we also have a 3 megapixel camera
with that's capable of doing CIF
resolution video so that's a very low
resolution video camera and we have this
motoblur emblem on the back and this
device is running motoblur 1.5 so we can
just pop this off
a plastic battery cover by the way on
and the battery is a 1540 milliamp hour
battery it's capable of around 400
minutes of talk time and i think around
280 hours of standby time something
insane that's like six and a half hours
of talk time so big battery you take
this off here we have our SIM card slot
i have a micro sim in there right now
because i was using my iphone 4 with
this sim card and we also have a 2
gigabyte microSD card that comes with it
i like to do is pull this up and slide
it out to change it out it's capable of
up to 32 gigabytes of storage so that's
a great thing to have the processor of
this motorola Bravo he is an 800
megahertz with 2 gigabytes of wrong and
512 megabytes of RAM we also have
assisted GPS a digital compass and all
the other great stuff that android 2.1
devices have become standard in
incorporating into the phone itself so
the radios that are included with the
device is a quad-band gsm chip along
with UMTS 850 and 1900 for Wi-Fi we have
B G and N and also Bluetooth 2.1 this
device does have an FM radio like I
mentioned before and I'll show you that
and the software tour coming up next and
in case you miss it you can check out
this link right about here to go to the
unboxing and if you like everybody let's
make sure you give us a thumbs up and
also leave some comments down below we
like to hear you're saying and thanks
