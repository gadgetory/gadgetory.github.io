calm and so far you've seen us unbox the
xperia x10 from sony ericsson you've
seen us give you a hardware overview as
well as a software overview and now it's
time to complete the software overview
in our part 2 we're going to actually
show you the interface compared next to
a samsung galaxy s we're going to give
you a browser test test the YouTube
application and just take a look at
general navigation so let's go ahead and
get started alright and we are back and
the first thing we're going to take a
look at here is actually the interface
now as you can see we are using custom
interfaces on both these two devices you
have the samsung galaxy s the unlocked
version here on the left in the sony
ericsson xperia x10 here on the right
now Samsung uses the TouchWiz interface
which takes a lot of criticism because
frankly it's not the greatest now the
Sony uses also their own version however
we've gone ahead and overlaid these so
here on the Samsung Galaxy S on the left
we're using launcherpro because this is
actually an android 2.1 device
unfortunately the sony ericsson xperia
x10 on the right here is only android
1.6 which means that launcher pro is not
available to download so we actually had
to use ADW launcher they're both great
versions though the first test we're
going to run is actually a browser
comparison between these two devices now
we're going to use the stock package
browser we're not going to use any kind
of third-party aftermarket browser at
all so let's go ahead and press the two
short cuts down here at the same exact
time and you'll see which one will
actually load first now we're going to
wait and pull a pocket now as always now
right here we can actually just press
the toolbars you see there now with the
sony ericsson we actually have to come
over here press the menu button and then
press the go so it's an extra step there
can be a little annoying at times
alright so now we have both websites
queued up here we're going to press the
both of these same exact time and we'll
see which one loads first now right off
the bat you can see these the samsung
galaxy s pulled right ahead the xperia
x10 is somewhat keeping up but the
galaxy s is practically done and as you
can see it's automatically scaled to fit
the page that is not the case with the
x10 and that's one of the main factors
here it's actually going to hinder the
overall experience the fact that it's
not going to load the site in the full
aspect you have to actually zoom in and
out manually now of course you can
scroll up and down here but you do not
have multitouch support so you can
either use the volume rocker actually on
the left side to zoom in and out this
way accordingly or you have to press the
menu button in order to zoom in and out
galaxy s whereas you can simply zoom up
and down multi-touch in and out very
very smooth transition there so overall
the web browsing experience on the x10
unfortunately isn't the greatest it will
get the job done but it's not going to
be something that you want to be using
primarily as a web browser on your
portable device so you'll likely want to
download a third-party browser of some
kind next up we're actually going to go
ahead and open up tweetcaster so we'll
press the home button on both least you
go right back to the home as you can see
we have tweetcaster on the home page
here right off the bat you can tell the
screen of this of the samsung galaxy s
looks much better now looks like the
galaxy s actually froze and that's one
of the main issues with this device is
it does tend to be laggy and lock up at
times for no apparent reason so because
that the x10 was able to load
tweetcaster much faster once again some
of the colors may appear to be more
vibrant however if we zoom in here on
the Galaxy S because it is a super
amoled screen and now it's time for a
two-part run-through we're going to test
the YouTube application to see how fast
it's able to actually render the video
and pull up the video Lotus that you can
actually watch it we're also going to
show you launcherpro an ADW launcher on
both these devices so on the left here
we have launcher pro now you can
actually customize what they call the
doc here now we only have one doc set up
you can actually scroll through multiple
docs it's going to give you these three
home screens you can see here you can do
up to five if you'd like we only have
two though that are currently working
right now ADW which is on the right on
the xperia x10 by default will give you
the five home screens two on each side
as well as your center as you can see
here one two it will give you kind of
the same idea with the dock you can
actually press the buttons on the side
to basically quick snap and
that have actually having to swipe your
finger now pressing the menu button will
bring up the app drawer which actually
kind of floats in and it Scrolls from
left to right you can see here we have
to go left and right to actually use
that with launcher pro the same idea
it'll actually float right in however
it's going to scroll up and down and it
seems to be a little bit of a smoother
transition between this here which seems
to almost kind of stutter that may be
part of the actual design so now we're
going to go ahead and open up the
YouTube application on both of these and
we're going to search for pocket now now
we haven't used a pocket now video on
these before this is going to be a true
dry run now you can probably see here
the blacks on the Samsung Galaxy S look
much deeper whereas in the x10 they look
a little washed out now the brightness
is up all the way on both these devices
so that's a fair test there so we're go
ahead and type in pocket now now as you
actually see I made a typo on typing
pocket now and that's going to reflect
on the keyboard and the screen quality
for some reason the calibration or the
actual screen quality itself doesn't
seem to be spot-on when typing a lot of
times we have typos now that could be
the device has to be calibrated it could
be the screen itself or it could just be
this one device that we have but there's
been a lot of issues typing on this
on-screen keyboard so we have the pocket
now video able to run on both we're
going to pass the ball at the same time
just real quick is to bring it up bring
up the actual channel for our site and
we will load the Kindle 3 unboxing which
is relatively new and as you see it was
able to load just a tad faster on the
samsung galaxy s know one thing I do
want you to see and I'll actually zoom I
you can get a better aspect of it are
the colors on the samsung galaxy s super
amoled screen they look much more
saturated now you may call that a little
fake because it is so saturated
personally this does look washed out
here this looks more realistic here but
your mileage may vary and it's all in
the eye of the beholder now as you just
saw the sony ericsson xperia x10 is
capable of loading apps extremely
quickly
it was more than able to keep up if not
beat our Samsung Galaxy S loading some
of the applications such as YouTube and
tweetcaster however when it comes to the
browsing we stock Sony browser
definitely leaves more to be desired it
needs to be improved with the overall
navigation hopefully that will happen in
their 2.1 update one issue with the x10
is that when doing some major
multitasking running a few different
applications at once you will notice a
lot of slow down the device will bog
down and that's due to partly available
at Mater 4am it could also be just the
simple memory management of android 1.6
when you're using a few different
applications at once the snappiness goes
away very quickly all right it has been
part 2 of the software overview of the
sony ericsson xperia x10 android
smartphone make sure you stay tuned for
our upcoming final review and final word
on this device right here as always
please give us a thumbs up and leave us
any comments with any feedback or
questions you may have to this video
