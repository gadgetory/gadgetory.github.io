for a day what rumors emerge of
microsoft surface mini and the galaxy s5
goes live everywhere along with the gear
lineup I'm hi Mary meta and the Friday's
were designed for one reason and one
reason only but you know mine so what's
yours this is parking out daily before
we end this week let's go through the
official a Samsung has now made its
Galaxy s5 available everywhere almost
everywhere since there are some delays
in certain countries as usually expected
but it's the galaxy s5 along with the
gear lineup so you can pick either of
these phones and interesting we see
these crazy lines in the UK for the gs5
but it's not really for the phone these
are people that actually pre-order the
phone and they were allowed to be in
line earlier before the launch so they
could take a hand on the phone before
everybody else that was outside really
interesting way to handle the press but
anyways are you getting the phone leave
us a comment down below now this is very
interesting talking about the galaxy s5
there is this leaked document from HTC
that's actually internal that specifies
the different reasons why the HTC One m8
is superior to the gs5 which is
interesting there are definitely some
reasons why the One m8 is better than
the gs5 but the document doesn't say
otherwise why is the gs5 better than the
m8 and there are some reasons there but
which one do you find better leave us a
comment n view the links of the
scripture for details on what HTC
considers to be better now sorry about
Microsoft as a even though the microsoft
surface tablet hasn't really been the
most popular tablet out there the
company has been working on a many
tablets at least the rumors and
apparently the tablet is going to be
ready for launch in the next couple of
months apparently it'll happen this
quarter and interesting it seems that it
will support styluses or styli or
whatever you want to call that thing so
it could be that this is actually a pro
tablet and not a Windows RT tablet which
would make it very compelling let's see
what we get and speaking of compelling
devices the battery life came for 2013
was the LG g2 where I still missed that
phone but we got more rumors that the LG
g3 won't be launched the next couple of
months and we are getting a 2k displayed
on the stone which is really
interesting as this will not be a
samsung ripoff definitely hopefully they
keep the same design I did like the
design of the g2 but the 2k display
would definitely be cool especially at a
time when almost every manufacturer
completely ignored that spec except for
the fine 7 which is coming very soon for
review by the way and finally for the
very interesting news of the day it was
rumored that Google was going to launch
Google glass for sale to the public and
there's an update the company is
actually going to do it but it's only
going to happen for one day and one day
only on April fifteenth the problem is
they're still going to be selling that
thing for fifteen hundred dollars so now
anybody can buy Google glass as long as
you buy it on that specific date if you
want to buy you can definitely get it
but the question is are you really
willing to cough that amount of money so
that leaves you to the question of the
day are you going to try to get google
glass on april fifteenth does that you
is that what you want because in my
particular case I'll admit it I've used
google glass I try to not in mwc
somebody was using it and allowed me to
try it it is awkward you know it'll
probably be cool eventually when it fits
normal glasses but for me honestly I
feel that it's too ahead of its time and
there is some public etiquette issues
with that but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video's filming
