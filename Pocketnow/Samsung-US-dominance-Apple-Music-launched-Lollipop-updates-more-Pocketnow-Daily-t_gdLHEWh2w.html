success chassis and it doesn't look good
samson regains its us smartphone
dominance as new numbers get revealed we
get a bevy of software updates launched
today I'm high Meadow iveta and can
somebody explain to me why ones they
seem to be shorter days this is parking
out daily there are a ton of official
news today and it starts with ample as
the company has just launched iOS 84 +
OS 10 10 for for the mac and the updates
are significant when it comes to iOS 8
dot for particularly because of Apple
music in addition to the fact that I
books now support to audiobooks and we
also get a ton of bug fixes but in the
case of OS 10 we also get support for
apple music and we get a couple of bug
fixes with Wi-Fi as consumers we're
complaining so uh both updates are free
links to the description to get them
other positive software updates include
the Moto X 2014 from verizon it's now
getting Android five dot one which
should mean that the other US carrier
should join the wagon and I'm talking to
you AT&amp;amp;T in addition to that we also
have the droid turbo from verizon
getting lollipop today and the HTC One
m9 for spring should be getting Android
five dot one as well so stay tuned for
that other interesting official news
come from Apple as the company has just
filed a new patent that allows you to
share data through a handshake a high
five or a bow this is interesting coming
from the company that took years to
allow iPhone users to share through
airdrop but it's a feature that will
apparently allow you share something we
just don't know exactly either what will
be shared or if it'll ever happen as we
know how Cupertino behaves when it comes
to patents and even though we've been
covering a ton of rumors of changes with
the iphone success with the chassis that
there will be no ugly marks in the back
in addition to a dual lens camera you
could put all those rumors to rest we've
got some trusted sources showing us the
chassis of the iphone success and sorry
but it looks just like an iphone 6 in
every single way i don't really think
that there will be some major changes
when it comes to hardware design it will
most likely just be a boost in
specifications but we will learn more in
the next coming months and finally for
the very
interesting news of the day analytics
firms are already confirming that
Samsung is back to being the smartphone
king of the United States it currently
owns fifty-five percent of it market
that if you do the Android numbers that
only account to sixty-six percent of the
whole US market then yes Samsung owns
Android by a big chunk and the United
States by a big chunk leaving Apple and
thirty something percent thirty-three
percent i believe it was and yeah it
seems that the galaxy s6 has everything
to do with this even though obviously
Samsung sells more than just the galaxy
s6 in the United States it leads you to
the question of the day what do you
think about Samsung's success do you
believe that the galaxy s6 is a good
product good enough to bring Samson
backed with limelight in my case I like
the phone I just wish the battery was
better but I'm happy for samsung they've
tried I just wish they tried harder with
software update I'm talking about the
Galaxy Note edge leave us a comment down
