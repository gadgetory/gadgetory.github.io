by updating some of its applications we
get more leaks on lg super-premium phone
and photos and boy did amazon just go
crazy with its new tablet lineup I'm hi
Mary Vera enjoying the benefits of this
sort of a tan somehow this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with amazon as the company has just
announced its new lineup of fire tablets
and they are going crazy with the price
tags one of the tablets is just the
fifty-dollar tablet with a full IPS
display and some decent specifications
and then things guess callate up to two
hundred fifty dollars in tablet options
and they're not necessarily bad
particularly because well it seems that
they run some sort of new version of
Android that's not really that bookshelf
type that we saw before let's see what
we get in the end by September 30th I
suppose the spotlight over to Google as
the company has just made it official
that Google glass is now going to be
called project Allah Allah not our Allah
with a you in the middle and this is
interesting as a google glass was
already a product and now it seems that
things are being pushed back to making
it a project again so yeah this is a the
same google team though we now have some
amazon employees being included in the
mix all reporting to Tony Fadell let's
see what we get and speaking of Google
the company has just made some major
changes to its Google applications
you'll notice that on the Google Play
Store everything's getting updated and
it looks a lot like Android M for you
that are using a typical android phone
but if you're already using the Android
and preview you'll notice that now on
tap is also working in addition to the
fact that the Google now launcher in
your case will look like everything will
look in Android marshmallow in the
future so we do see progress we just
can't wait to see when it reaches
everybody else but not everything is
good news for Google as we've got a full
video showing exactly how you can hack
some Android lollipop lock screens it's
actually not the simplest procedure in
the world you actually have to follow
different things to be able to do this
you need a full string but yeah it seems
that Google does need to start working
on its security for android lollipop we
should all just get an upgrade to
android em right and finally for the
very hot leaks of the day we get to the
LG class smartphones shown in a dummy
mock-up and it helps us confront a lot
of things and by the way we call it LG
class because that's part of the teaser
we're not really sure if this is the
final name for the product but one of
the things we learn is that apparently
yes this will be a full metal enclosure
which is something unique for LG at the
moment and the other thing is that yeah
it's a complete departure to everything
we've ever seen from LG when it comes to
bezels and design that's not necessarily
a good thing but it could have a purpose
and we can't wait to learn more when it
gets announced the next few days but it
does lead me to the question of the day
are you looking forward to this probable
LG super premium phone is this something
you're wanting to get in my case I'm
already liking the LG g4 a lot I've been
testing it for the last couple of weeks
but yeah I am looking forward to this
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know what you think friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the Rose earlier before this video
is so make sure you follow what I'm
talking out at common subscription
channel as well and also follow me on
Twitter high-mileage quarterly veteran
instagram at hi mera neta please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am hi Mary better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
