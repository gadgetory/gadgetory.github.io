and they include a curved display and
better cameras according to analyst
Apple sales struggles are finally
passing thanks to cut in my phone prices
and the 1 + 5 g device seems to be a big
leap in mobile gaming platforms I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes this is actually
not the last day of MWC it's a pre
recording because I should take a day
off don't you think this is pocket out
daily the official loose today begin
with product launches that are actually
not deals as SanDisk as a announced it's
one terabyte microSD card that's
actually faster than current SD cards it
falls into a different architecture and
what looks like every micro SD card the
problem is obviously price tags we're
talking $450 at launch which is crazy if
you think about it but well the 512
gigabyte card launched last year it was
costing the same money and now it cost
200 so hold off for it now let's talk
about Samsung as the company continues
launching products now in India we have
the new M 30 being announced this
follows the M line which actually brings
a lot of affordability to a very
beautiful design of you ask me got
ripple cameras a five thousand milliamp
hour battery and if I understood it
correctly it retails for just 210 bucks
you can learn more in the description
now it's not about the 1 plus 7 or 1 + 5
G or whatever the code is going to be as
95 Google is claiming that they saw a
prototype here at MWC we didn't see a
prototype but what we do know is that
there were a ton of devices being shown
to test off 5g and probably the biggest
news is not what was leaked but mainly
what was being done as it seems that
hardcore gaming was being done through
5g on these oneplus devices it's
actually an interesting combination if
you think about the probability of
having steam work on a phone we'll see
now let's talk about iPhones as we've
got analysts already claiming that sales
for iPhones are already back on track
now the thing about it is if you thought
that the devices that were being sold
best for the new
one's actually that's not the case it
seems the cutting prices has actually
stimulated sale of devices like the
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus which people
still want interesting and finally the
hottest missions that I have to do with
the Huawei P 30 and P 30 Pro we continue
getting more leagues on specifications
apparently both devices will bring
triple cameras according to the source
but these cameras are going to be
different sort of what we have with them
a 20 and mate 20 Pro and obviously we
have different resolutions on each
camera but apparently in the case of the
p30 pro one of these cameras is gonna
have 10x optical zoom which I'll see to
believe and then the other sensors are
probably going to be a time of flight
which rather concerns me because I
thought we were getting the wide angle
that we have on the may 20 Pro whatever
the case may be let us know in the
comments down below what do you think
10x optical plus time of flight and no
white angle would you like that because
in my case I want my wide angle but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us on parking our comment subscribe to
both of our channels English and Spanish
for more videos like this one you follow
me on Twitter I have just quarterly that
are on Instagram at home it'll be better
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw i'm high- and i
think so much for watching we'll see you
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
