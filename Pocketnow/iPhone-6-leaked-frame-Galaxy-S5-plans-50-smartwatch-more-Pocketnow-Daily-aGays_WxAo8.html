design and unchanged camera Samsung
comes clear about their plants with the
galaxy s5 in galaxy note 4 and
smartwatches could be getting more
attractive pricing I'm primarily that I
and isn't it odd that the iphone is
getting bigger and the iPads are kind of
getting smaller this is pocket out daily
let's search day off with some official
news as t-mobile CES presentation just
happened then they've just filled the
beans the company is willing to pay you
for your early termination fees on any
of the major carriers to switch the
mobile up to 350 bucks I'll have to do
is turn in your phone but then again
even though this is a very very good
deal makes you wonder how they're gonna
plan to deal with the fact that their
network is still not as good as they'd
want it to be anyway and on to other
official news if you're interested in
getting the Moto G on verizon you can do
so today and it's great because the
phone will just cost you a hundred
dollars prepaid and wait before you
start celebrating there is a catch I
don't know if you've noticed but the
verizon plans are actually the most
expensive ones when it comes to prepaid
it's actually twice as expensive when
compared to t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T so I think
it would be cheaper to actually pay the
hundred eighty bucks for the phone
anywhere else and save some money on the
plan now archos is a company that we
haven't really talked about before but
they do deserve some praise right now
they're CES presentation just finished
and the company is offering us a couple
of smartwatches that look like the
pebble but it'll only cost you 50 bucks
when you think about the fact that's a
hundred dollars off the old pebble two
hundred dollars off the new pebble and
you're getting pretty much the same
functionality hopefully we haven't
really tested it yet it is a very sweet
deal we just hope that they do it very
soon they're promising it for later this
year now let's talk about the iphone 6s
we get the first leaks of the stone or
at least its design and we're thinking
that this is probably just an early
prototype we're seeing a chassis that is
big and we're talking about a 4.7 inch
display type of big which is really
interesting that they're trying to make
the phone bigger for their next revamp
it is due for a full revamp now so let's
see how that goes but even more
interesting is the fact that well the
camera apparently will not change around
the same 8-megapixel camera that we
currently have which is kind of sad
though again this is Apple we don't
really know what to expect so we'll keep
you posted on these rumors they're going
to start now and they're not going to
stop until that phone launches and
finally for the hot news of the day
Samson's executives just sat down with
Bloomberg for an interview and they
spill the beans for their galaxy lineup
this year first of all the galaxy s5 is
getting a dramatic revamp according to
them and was it this appointment of the
galaxy s4 was just a minute of update
and they want to change that but we're
also getting a new galaxy gear along
with this phone so buyers beware this
one will change dramatically and then we
are getting a new galaxy s4 and
apparently it will be more expensive
because they're planning to focus it on
professionals people that are actually
willing to pay for it but anyways that
leaves you see the question of the day
what would be your one wish to change
for the galaxy lineup this year because
in my particular case I want a better
battery galaxy s5 like I do like that is
like the only thing I wouldn't care
about the update the design just a
better battery but leave us a comment
down below what do you want and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
still make sure you follow us on parking
i'll comment subscribe to our youtube
channel as well you can also follow me
on twitter Jaime underscore any better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am high Meadow

see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
