showing us that they could totally blend
lifestyle design and a very affordable
price tag in a very good package and now
it's time to see what they've got for
2019
reporting from CES in Las Vegas I'm
hiding that IV out of a pocket now with
jewels going on camera and let's dive in
let's begin with a blackberry key to le
those of you that want an alternative to
thumb typing on your keyboard on Verizon
it is heading that way we don't have
specific dates or a price tag but we do
know that it is the slight variant
exclusively and it should happen in the
next few weeks when it comes to Alcatel
we were actually briefed on two devices
probably the most important one is this
one their new 2019 One X because the
price tag is going to be around 120
dollars it's got this very interesting
suede like finish in black and blue
we're targeting a 5.5 inch HD plus LCD
made by TCL at 18 by 9 aspect ratio a
quad-core MediaTek processor 1.5
gigahertz 2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of
expandable storage and a 3000 milliamp
hour battery the fingerprint scanner is
optional depending on the carrier and
whatever they choose but they do talk
about their face key technology for
facial recognition which they call great
and we'll have to test dual cameras also
just reach this line up the primary
sensor being of 13 megapixels with a
secondary 2 megapixel depth sensor
there's even a neat trick for a one
handed mode where you can swipe from the
top to reveal easier to reach controls
now let's talk about the Alcatel one see
this little package in blue is only $70
or around that price tag obviously to
keep the price down there is only 3G
connectivity there's a 1.3 gigahertz
spread from processor 1 gigabyte of RAM
8 gigs of storage and a 2 thousand
milliamp hour battery powering the entry
level specifications as Android ogo
specifically designed for these
scenarios cameras are a 5 megapixel rear
and a 2 megapixel front and a display is
a 5-inch 18 by 9 full view LCD DCL also
showed us their future plans for the
Blaz because they are taking this market
seriously we saw two different variants
and sadly they didn't provide details as
to when we should expect them on devices
or anything but I will tell you this
much there is a punch hole in one of
them and the viewing angles are really
really top notch so that has been knit
for TCL here at CES 2019 let us know
