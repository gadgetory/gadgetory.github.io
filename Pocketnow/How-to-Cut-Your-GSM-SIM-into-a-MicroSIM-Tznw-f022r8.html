phones get smaller the stuff that you
plug into them has to get smaller too
now we've seen that with USB we've gone
from USB to mini-usb and now micro USB
we've seen SD cards go to mini SD and
now micro SD and it's already in process
SIM cards what you use in GSM phones are
switching over to micro Sims well did
you know that you can cut down your
full-size SIM into a micro sim
relatively easily it's not too hard in
this video we'll show you how to do it
so here's my GSM Galaxy Nexus and it is
GSM so it takes a sim we can take that
out really easily and take a look at it
it's really just a credit card material
that it's got this little circuit board
on it now in the olden days this circuit
board took up more or less the whole
card and this area that the gold area
was just contacts it was just where you
plugged it in well these days they've
shrunk the circuitry down and now it
fits all entirely underneath that little
contact area and well you can make them
smaller so here we've got the HTC One S
and I'll take the top off and over here
it says it needs a micro SIM now a lot
of the Apple products require that as
well
so what do we do well I don't want to go
out and get a separate sim because I
still want to be able to use my Galaxy
Nexus here so I purchased one of these
this is a micro sim cutter
and essentially it takes your SIM and it
cuts it down to size so we're gonna go
ahead and do that live on camera here
and hopefully we're not gonna break
things it shows you how to put it in
there's your little diagram with the
notch and it says you know just stick it
in just like that so we'll go ahead and
do that and then just very easily
there's another diagram just in case
we're gonna punch it and it does require
some pressure and there we go I have
just cut
a micro-sim out of my full-size SIM and
you can see there's the area now you can
do a couple things you can keep this
little shell if you will and use that to
plug this back into your phone or comes
with these neat little trays this little
tray you just stick this in there and
you should be good you may need to file
down the the backside of your sim to
make this fit because it does add a
little bit of bulk but then you've got a
regular sized sim and a micro sim so
does this work let's find out
look at our little diagram here and see
how it wants to plug in and sure enough
fits perfectly pop that out I'm gonna
put it into our little tray and now
we're gonna take that and slide it down
and it is a bit snug but it still slides
down just fine
into the the Galaxy Nexus here and you
can see that it says that I don't have
any signal and we'll see if that's a
problem I'll let you know that in the
comments on the video but that's how you
can cut down a full sized sim into a
micro sim using a sim punch this punch
by the way cost me about six dollars
including shipping it said it came with
four of these little trays it only came
with three but for 6 bucks I'm not going
to complain if you'd like a link to
where you can get one if you want to cut
down your own sim and that of your
friends go ahead and head over to
pocketnow.com and I'll have a link to
where I bought mine from so really kind
of cool cutting down your Sims I'm Joe
