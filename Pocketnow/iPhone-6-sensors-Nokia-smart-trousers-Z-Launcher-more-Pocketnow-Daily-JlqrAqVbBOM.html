better device accuracy the division that
Microsoft did not buy from Nokia just
launched an Android launcher and believe
it or not nokia wants to get into your
pants but in a very odd way I'm
hematuria better and the only thing I
want getting into my pants is money
aside from the obvious other things that
I can't mention on video this is parking
out daily the official news today are
surprising as Nokia but the division
that Microsoft did not buy has just
launched an Android launcher it's called
the Z launcher there's a full video
hands-on of everything you can expect
from this in the links in description
for Michael Fisher and a way to download
it though this is a limited beta and
it's interesting as a nokia has
rethought the way you should use android
and it's a smarter launcher according to
them because it notice is what you use
most and it'll give you that on your
home screen again give it a try and does
what you think in the comments down
below another official news t-mobile has
just announced uncarrier 5.0 and six
point 0 and this is really interesting
i've been trying to mobile in the last
couple of weeks when i was in here and
their service isn't bad but it's getting
better as the company is going to give
you an iphone 5s for trial for a full
week for you to test their networks and
that's free from everything you can
crash that thing or whatever that's
giving us some ideas uh yeah you can
actually use the phone for whatever you
want and try their services out and when
it comes to uncarrier six point oh well
they rethought music streaming or it
should be limited to you so it makes the
description for the two things that in
carrier 5 point 0 and 6 point over
offering it's really compelling and I
wish other carriers would follow the
same groove now let's talk about Apple
and iOS 8 as it's common for the company
not to give us absolutely everything
that its launching at its event because
it's too short we've got some reports
that iOS 8 will include full manual
controls but there's a catch as
apparently the company plans to continue
having the same camera application that
they have which includes some new things
like a timer but apparently they don't
want to go away from the automatic
controls that it currently has which
actually do a very very good job but
carolee they're giving manual controls
the third party developers to bring new
applications like the nokia camera app
for example with full iso controls
exposure everything shutter speeds you
name it so hopefully that will be the
case in the final build as apparently
this will be part of the sdk i'll talk
about the iphone 6s more code within the
sdk reveals that there is support for a
barometer for the future generation
iphone call it iphone 6 or whatever you
want to call it to and why would you
need a barometer you have it on the
galaxy s4 galaxy s5 and the reason why
is it gives you accurate pressure
altitude of your biker you're a hiker
you're up in a mountain or something you
want to get accurate date especially if
you do not have internet connection this
thing will actually give you accurate
readings and obviously there are
purposes for that maps etc so hopefully
that will be the case as Apple has not
launched new sensors in a long time and
finally for the very hilarious news of
the day nokia has just launched wireless
trousers wireless charging trousers and
I'm talking about pants because
obviously in the US you don't call them
trousers up that charge your phone they
have G wireless charging with a 2400
milliamp hour battery adapted to them
and yeah they charge your phone which is
really odd i mean why isn't there some
sort of like an accessory and there
actually is this bag accessory with
pocket accessory where you just slip
your phone and it'll charge it so i'm
really trying to understand the whole
concept of having a wireless charging
pair of pants where instead you could
probably invest your time on giving us
batteries that will last longer not
leave these are the question of the day
what do you think about these new
innovations and wireless charging in my
particular case it doesn't matter if i
get those things for free i will not
wear them you know especially because
pants or something that hey not
everybody likes it's a style thing leave
us a comment down below i feel that
they're climbing the ladder up the wrong
wall we need better batteries and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is so make sure you follow us on
parking out commons description channel
as well it also follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore iveta let's give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Natalie better thank you
