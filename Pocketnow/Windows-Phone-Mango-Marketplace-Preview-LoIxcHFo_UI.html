and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview okay now let's look at
what's new in the windows phone
marketplace so there that was a really
quick loading sometimes on windows phone
7 you see a loading screen here so I
think that has been approved get it
right away and you see we still have ATT
store Samson story so you still have a
custom stores there but now we have
podcasts this goes to a listing featured
we have the top podcasts and you get
audio or video podcasts they're all in
here we have some new ones it's sort by
genre and there's featured we also have
the search button so let's see if we can
find a good one
there we go and now from here I can just
stream whichever one I want to listen to
I can subscribe or unsubscribe and I
have settings so I can set it to
download three one two or all of them
there's my options and you can set it to
only download over Wi-Fi if you want to
save your here we are there's your
overview so that's a great addition we
can get podcasts straight on the device
right now instead of having to go to the
desktop and sink them from the desktop
software over here you got some apps
listed games it's kind of a slight
redesign there's some music there's a
featured app we also have some new hub
designs this is going to the music and
you see for all these there's a search
button at the bottom because the
hardware search key no longer does
context instead of searching so this is
a new one games no longer goes just a
list you get a big graphic hub design
panoramic
so that's a new edition pretty nice
looking now let's get into one of these
apps so the app page has been redesigned
a bit right here we just have the
description now and you swipe together
reviews screenshots on a separate screen
and you can even use these as your
wallpaper or saved phone it's kind of
cool and we have related school related
lists and course the share button that's
nice and the search has been improved to
now when I search we have a pivot to
choose different types let's try
something else
so now we can search podcasts or apps
and games or music it doesn't jumble
them all together anymore so that's a
good thing be sure to check out Pacquiao
calm for our full windows phone mango
preview with lots more videos and text
and pictures and everything that's it
for now
