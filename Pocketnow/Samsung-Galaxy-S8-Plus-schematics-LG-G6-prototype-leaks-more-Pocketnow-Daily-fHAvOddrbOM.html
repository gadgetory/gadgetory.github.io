that this is actually no concept design
the LG G six prototype emerges the show
is just how far it's gone an apple and
samsung keep getting overshadowed by
Huawei Nobu and growth I'm hi Mary Vera
my last night's sleep begun today at
five a.m. and it wasn't because I was
partying anyway since parking out daily
the official is they begin with weird
event invitations we heard from sources
within Samsung that the galaxy SI was
not going to be announced that mwc
edited has for the past three years but
same thing is still teasing something
for februari 27th they sent out
presentation and obviously we will be in
Buffalo no covering everything let's see
just how much of a tease we get now
let's talk about smartphone growth in
the global scale as we've got analytics
already that proved that Sampson
continues to reign supreme even with the
galaxy Don seven debacle the company
still holds twenty percent of the global
market share trailing behind them that
quarter in sales with Apple at fourteen
percent all great numbers great growth
and everything but the most interesting
members came from Huawei and Oppo these
companies are currently third and fourth
obviously because the good cycle for
Apple and every other case these
companies are over Apple when it comes
to smartphone sales but these companies
have grown a significant amount over the
last couple of quarters it just shows
you the amount of effort of other
companies not necessarily just the fruit
ones or the samsung ones now let's talk
about google voice and project Phi I and
a big customer of both services google
voice pretty much saves me every time
that I have so many review devices that
I can't be giving out too many phone
numbers then project file is probably
your favorite and best companion when
you're traveling abroad the biggest
problem is that these two services don't
talk to each other if you have a project
5 phone number you can't connect with
the google voice and just give out what
number there are some sources that are
claiming that both services are going to
be able to work together without merging
which is something that i love we will
keep you
now let's talk about the LG G six as
we've got the first leaked photographs
of the phone and its prototype phase and
boy was that thing ugly in that stage
but it could just be because of
everything that's attached the photos
what we do see is definitely the metal
trim we're not exactly sure if the back
of the palette we do see that there are
dual cameras here and it just proves the
show that even though this phone is not
necessarily the prettiest thing I've
ever seen it's not the ugliest either we
can not wait to see the final product
and finally the very hot news today have
to do again with the fans and galaxy of
eight I am bored of this being the
hottest news and i know you are too but
i wish companies did a better job at
handling this because believe it or not
this is the hottest phone that we're
waiting for right now we've got some
late schematics of the phone for those
of you that were wondering exactly what
this thing was going to look like if the
flash was going to be at the top to the
bottom fingerprint scanner etc these
kinetics pretty much show that the
reason designs are the final ones and
this is not necessarily a good thing I
don't know about you guys I don't like
that fingerprint scanner being so high
at the top and that's the only thing
that I do like is Mike got that screen
to body ratio is insane leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about these chromatics is this fun
enticing to you for me obviously it is I
can't wait to review it but leave us a
comment down below we look to know your
