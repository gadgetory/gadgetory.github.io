pocketnow.com and this will look at a
new interface for windows mobile called
infinity by a company called AG and
sorry if I'm mispronouncing that this is
an alpha right now so it's not feature
complete and it may be a little bit
buggy but anyone can download it for
free and give it a try you can kind of
get a sense for what the developer has
in mind by using the Alpha so to start
here's the unlock screen it's very
simple right now though the developer
wants to make this customizable so
presumably that means you can add
various pieces of information to the
screen maybe next appointment or who
knows what they have in mind so I'm just
going to unlock here and then we get a
very SPD mobile shell like interface
where we have a panel to the left we can
add additional panels and then a panel
to the right this is actually sort of
like the HTC Sense interface on an
Android device you have these multiple
panels where you can add widgets and
that sort of thing so there's not much
you can do with this at this point you
can tap and hold to add a widget but
right now you can only add a digital
clock and of course we already have a
digital clock but now there are two and
you can also add programs so I'm going
to tap and hold to make that go away and
actually I want to delete the clock so I
switch this icon down here to the trash
can I tap on whatever I want to delete
and it goes away and now I can add
things like a shortcut and there's the
little icon I can drag that around tap
on the icon say I want Excel mobile here
reposition it and then I tap and hold to
confirm you can do that with all these
other panels another thing you can do is
tap this circle button here to bring up
an Android like program launcher but
this is actually customizable doesn't
show you all the programs if you want
all the programs you tap here and if you
want to add a program to your quick
launcher you just press the plus button
check off something pretty quick and
easy and now you have FM radio in this
program launcher which is accessible
from any of your panels a really quick
way to get to programs that you use a
lot something else that this does is
that if you tap here in the notification
area you are able to quickly change the
system profile you can change the volume
of the system or the ringer you can go
to vibrate mode if you'd like you can
also go to this task manager which is
quite convenient to have it so easily
you can close file file explorer or any
other program that you have open that
may be taking up a lot of memory you
also get some things up here about
battery life and your signal strength of
the time and the date and things like
that so again right now infinity doesn't
do too much but it's in the early stages
of development and the developer says
there are a lot of things coming out
like additional widgets a lot more
customization potential and even some
ways to get wallpapers and different
kind of icons downloaded from their
website so i'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get infinity and
you can try it for yourself that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
