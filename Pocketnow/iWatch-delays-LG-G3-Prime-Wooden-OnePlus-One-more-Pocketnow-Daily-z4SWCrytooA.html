delayed we probably won't see it until
the end of the year even with the LG g3
there's apparently an LG g3 Prime in the
works and if you don't have a one plus
one yet apparently there are more
materials in the works I'm high
muttering that I and the what team are
you betting on for Sunday's walk-up
finals in my case it's tough i like both
teams but this is pocket out daily let's
begin today with what's official as
those of you that want the LG g3 on any
other carrier that's not AT&amp;amp;T well those
of you that pre-ordered the device on
t-mobile are probably already seeing it
on your doorstep you could also pick it
up at the store today and the same case
go through sprint sprint is also
offering the phone ask the day at their
stores so it's great to see that they're
there but for those of you that wanted
on verizon this probably the most
compelling deal you get the phone for a
hundred bucks after into your contract
and the palm is you'll have to wait
until july seventeenth stay tuned now
one thing that's really odd is the need
for prime devices this year as we saw
the galaxy s5 prime that we recently
reviewed and compared with the current
galaxy s5 and there were rumors of the
HTC want to make prime that never
happens and reports have it that there
is an LG g3 Prime now the interesting
part is that apparently this vote is
already available for pre-order in Korea
which is completely out of whatever we
were expecting I mean apparently this
phone has it the better LTE chips aside
reverse Snapdragon 805 but other than
that we really don't know the different
stay tuned we'll learn more about it
very soon now another artificial news
the 1+1 is one of those devices that
most of us want but can't really get
because it's got the most ridiculous way
to get it through invitations and crazy
things but hey hold on the company is
teasing something happening on july
twenty second it says knock on wood and
it's a wooden back that we could assume
would be more materials coming to the
oneplus one the problem is some of us
really don't want more materials we just
want the damn phone and for those of you
wondering what was samsung teasing for a
launch yesterday that was the samsung s
nose mod app if not mod ap processor and
reason why this is hot is because in the
past the exit nose chips did not have
LTE capabilities it had to be separate
so that's the main reason why the X and
L ships remained in Europe and then in
the United States we have to use the
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors
apparently this processor is going to be
ready very soon for products to come we
could assume that the Galaxy Note 4 will
probably be one of those first products
though a lot of cores and the bit
architecture wasn't really mentioned so
let's see what we get I really don't
know what the difference is i mean the
snapdragon 800 processors are so cool
it's going to be a tough one and finally
for the interesting news of the day
those of you that are waiting for the
eyewash should probably not wait for it
or at least not for the next couple of
months I mean it's not like if you buy
watches all the time especially not
smart watches but apparently Apple is
running into so many manufacturing
hurdles trying to build this timepiece
that it won't be ready in October where
some people claim nor September
apparently manufacturing will begin
until those months so we probably won't
see this product until the end of the
year or probably early next year which
leads me to the question of the day how
many of you are holding on for the
iWatch now that we have Android wear you
know because in my case I really want
that moto 360 and I'll probably buy it
and since a lot of people buy more than
one watch I will probably wait for the
iWatch but it'll all depends I am
waiting for the iWatch but the Moto 360
will be another product they was a
comment down below what's your king and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get it was earlier before this video
is still mushy follow was on parking out
