anticipated Galaxy Note 3 twice and we
loved it both times but how is its
larger sibling let's find out I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow
and this is our full review of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition
Samsung once again
has managed to trim the physical
footprint of its flagship device but
thankfully not at the expense of
specifications the Note 10.1 2014
edition is quite small in comparison to
its like sized counterparts 240 3.1
millimeters wide 170 1.4 millimeters
tall and 7.9 millimeters thick it also
hits the scales at an impressive 540
grams
there's much to be said for how great
and meticulous Samsung is when it comes
to conserving and making the absolute
most of every last bit of space the
outer shell of the Galaxy Note 10.1 is
nice well as nice as the device made
almost entirely plastic can be like the
smaller galaxy note 3 the Note 10.1 was
the recipient of a refreshed design the
trim is lined as to resemble the pages
of a closed notebook and the backside is
covered in a faux leather plastic which
offers a nice amount of grip but like
the white model note 3 the backside is
less tacky than we'd prefer to no
surprise the face pairs the navigation
button pattern we can't help but feel is
out of place on a 10-inch tablet it
encourages landscape use and makes the
tablet admittedly awkward to use in any
other orientation and that's unfortunate
but the internals are certainly nothing
to scoff at the 2014 edition Galaxy Note
10.1 comes with some of the best
specifications we've ever seen in a
tablet it's powered by Samsung's
in-house Exynos octa-core CPUs which
work together one clocked at 1.9
gigahertz and the other at 1.3 it has
three gigabytes of RAM and the eight
megapixel camera and a 31 watt our 80
220 million power battery we have the 32
gigabyte model on hand though it also
comes in 16 and 64 gigabyte capacities
with the ability to expand via microSD
the display is one of the best-looking
displays we've ever had the pleasure of
using at 10.1 inches and a resolution of
2560 by 1600 pixels it bears an
impressive density of 299 pixels per
inch it's similar to the Nexus 10
display in that it's unbelievably
yet this pedal builds on all the
shortcomings of last year's extra
high-resolution display the Super Clear
LCD on the Note 10.1 provides vibrant
colors wide viewing angles passable
contrast and black levels and it's
incredibly bright in fact we'll venture
to say the display is the absolute best
part of this tablet period the other key
piece of hardware in this tablet is the
s-pen love it or hate it there's no
denying the 2013 S Pen is a market
improvement over older s pins the
rubberized tip provides a more natural
friction wood riding the shape makes it
easier to hold it's easier to sheath
considering you can be inserted in
either orientation and the notch on its
button makes it easier to find without
too much filling around put simply the
Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition is the
best tablet hardware we've seen out of
Samsung's Android tablet lineup the
internals are impressive and the design
has greatly improved unfortunately
there's still a significant gap between
this hardware and the tablet hardware
we've seen out of competing firms such
as a soos or Apple
in many ways the software experience has
been enhanced as well but there's
certainly room for even more improvement
this year's Note 10.1 comes with Android
4.3 out of the box that means it brings
support for Bluetooth low-energy trim
and OpenGL ES 3.0 but Samsung's skin has
once again been slapped atop Google's
firmware and squandered some of Android
4.3
standout features for instance
multi-user support and Android 4.2
feature is completely absent
word has it this particular feature will
be included in a future update but we
wouldn't suggest holding your breath
while TouchWiz nullifies some of
androids stock value adds it brings a
handful of its own most of which are
less useful than Samsung would have us
believe smart stay smart rotate smart
Paul's and smart scroll are all present
as well as many motion controls chat on
Knox s translator s voice s note and
many of Samsung's other applications
come pre-installed - and of course
Samsung's content libraries Samsung hub
and Samsung Apps are available with
their comparatively sparse offerings if
we were to pick the absolute worst part
of the TouchWiz experience on the latest
Note 10.1 however it would have to be a
toss-up between the settings application
a confusing combination of tabs and a
two pane view and the notification shade
for Samsung to have gone the extra mile
to make full use of the 10 inch display
the full screen notification shade is a
major oversight that said there are a
few software features which more than
make up for the unnecessary bloat first
multi window the list of compatible
applications is sparse without some
hackery
but it's growing slowly but surely and
Samsung has added two very useful traits
to the multi window experience saved
pairs of applications and the ability to
drag and drop data between windows the
other is Air Command which is accessed
by long pressing the S Pen button and
hovering it over the display this
reveals action memo scrapbooker screen
right s finder and pen window the last
two being the most compelling and useful
pairing pin window with multi window is
a true testament to the note 10.1
utility over any other Android tablet
this combination allows you to run
upwards of six applications at once if
you so wish this is something no other
Android tablet can do at all so sure the
software has the very same flaws every
recent Android device from Samsung has
had but matters could certainly be worse
for this tablet performance is where
this review diverts a bit
we'd like to say the note 10.1 performs
incredibly well but while it performs
great the majority of the time the lag
and stutters are impossible to overlook
at times the tablet would freeze while
opening an application especially when
using multi window or even more simple
things like having a pin window open and
flicking through home screens eventually
the tablet catches up and things begin
to smooth out where performance issues
like these should not exist on a tablet
that's powerful we can't help but feel
the optimization or lack thereof of the
exodus octa chip is to blame the global
no 3 unit suffered from similar issues
while the Snapdragon 800 bearing No 3
did not it's performance and benchmarks
is passable yet nothing terribly
mind-blowing and it's gaming performance
paired with the gorgeous display is
great one of the best we've ever
experienced the side facing speakers add
to that gaming experience they're
surprisingly loud and while they're not
quite as tinny as we expected there
easily muffled their placement is
admittedly not the best and no they're
not the best speakers but they're
passable battery performance while in
use is impressive we were unable to kill
the battery in a single day even through
rather heavy usage patterns pulling a
handful of social accounts three Gmail
accounts web browsing gaming downloading
apps and even benchmarking we averaged
about two full days per charge but it
can't go without saying that the standby
is not great the tablet dropped between
10 or 20 percent over a single night
this however was less painful with the
power saver mode enabled the camera
performance as with any tablet isn't
worth getting excited over either the 8
megapixel camera on the back side of the
Note 10.1 is mediocre at best images
like proper saturation detail contrast
and air on the cool side it will work in
a pinch for stills and 1080p video but
there's a great chance your smartphone
will take better pictures so where does
that leave us well with a high powered
Android tablet with a ton of value
proposition but it does nothing to fight
the long-lasting stigma of poor
performing Android tablets with project
butter and chipsets which seem to have
very little trouble powering high-end
smartphones and tablets through the
worst abuse you can throw at them even
occasional freezing and lag is
unacceptable on a premium tablet that
retails for 550 dollars put simply if
you can deal with the occasional
performance hiccup in exchange for the
most advanced experience on an Android
to date you can't go wrong with the
Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition else maybe
you should stick to a stock Android
tablet or save up for the Snapdragon 800
powered LTE note 10.1 and for that we
give the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition
and eight point seven out of ten that's
