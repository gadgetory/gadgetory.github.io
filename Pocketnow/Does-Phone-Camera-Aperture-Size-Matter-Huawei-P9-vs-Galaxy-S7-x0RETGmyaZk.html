real camera review on the Huawei p9
where during that review I made the
following statement while we might be
concerned to see the smaller f 2.2
apertures over competing phones on
sensors this small the difference in
depth of field blur between F 1.8 and F
2.2 is fairly minimal we still achieve a
nice shallow blur to background wickets
and is actually prompted a handful of
comments from folks like this one apart
from the ridiculous statement that
aperture size differences are minimal on
phones it was a quite nice review which
got us thinking just how big a
difference should we expect from such
small camera sensors and we have some
great subjects to compare the galaxy s7
has a 1 over 2.5 inch image sensor and
we're assuming the p9 has something
closer to a 1 over 2 point 6 inch sensor
when looking at the pixel sizes between
the two reasonably close for smartphone
cameras the p9 has a 27 millimeter
equivalent lens and the galaxy s7 is
slightly wider a 26 millimeter field of
view again pretty comparable now the
galaxy s7 has an F 1.7 aperture while
the p9 uses F 2.2 apertures in
photography speak F 1.7 to f 2.2 is less
than 1 . difference in terms of aperture
size each stop represents a doubling of
the amount of light a sensor can soak up
through that aperture doing a little
quick math and F 1.7 aperture would let
in twice as much light as an f2 point
for aperture so we're a little closer to
a 2/3 of a stop difference the larger
the aperture the easier it is to get
light onto a sensor and it's easier to
blur the background of your photos so
with less than one stop difference in
hardware we should expect to see less
than one stop difference in background
blur we performed a series of tests
shooting photos of this baseball keeping
a consistent distance between the Huawei
and the galaxy looking at the
backgrounds we do see that the s7 has a
subtle advantage over the p9 in
producing a softer background but how
should we quantify this difference well
we duplicate
these distances and setups with a
Samsung mirrorless camera with an aps-c
sensor and a 24 millimeter equivalent
lens a slightly wider field of view but
still pretty close to these phones for
our purposes now comparing everything
the image is produced by the phone
cameras fall somewhere in between the
f10 and f/13 aperture shots from the
mirrorless camera though it's a little
easier to see a difference between the
mirrorless shots than it is to see
distinct differences between the blur
produced by both of these phones the
difference between f10 and f/13 is about
two thirds of a stop which is almost the
same as the difference between f 1.7 and
f 2.2 it's about two-thirds of a stop
but we don't see quite as much change
from phone to phone there is a
difference to be sure mostly noticeable
when pixel keeping on super macro shots
but it's tough to say that this is
really a significant difference in
performance and by significant we mean
should this change in depth of field
actually motivate someone to make a
different purchasing decision and we
don't think so plus it just reinforces
that for as good as our phone cameras
have gotten recently there are some
situations where you just can't quite
fight the physics of having a larger
camera sensor like that tasty tasty
mirrorless camera bouquet of course
software is starting to catch up there
too as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for more test videos like these
and hit that thumbs up button for a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos back now you
can chat me up on Twitter and Instagram
as some gadget guy and I will catch you
all on the next video
