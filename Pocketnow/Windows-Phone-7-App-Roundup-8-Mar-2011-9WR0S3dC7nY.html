net or com this is another episode of
the windows phone 7 app roundup and
which will review five applications in
30 seconds each so let's get started
accelerometer is a free application
allows you to view the axis of rotation
that your device orientated to so as you
can see I can assign all of them XY and
Z and I can view the exact orientation
of my device I can also upset the
default back to areas and I can change
the parameters of the x y&amp;amp;z just by
going here and changing the Y to Z and
the X X and as you can see I can go back
and I council calibrate and reset it so
if I wanted to find the exact angle that
I'm orientated to all if you do is
position it there and then lock onto
that Windows Phone 7 insiders a free
applications bail on the windows
marketplace they'll actually view the
top picks that Microsoft is chosen for
their top apps you can also go over here
and view the live wallpaper so let's say
you saw a Bing live wallpaper that you
really enjoyed you can just click on one
of these and it will begin to load and
all you do is download needs said that
as your wallpaper do like from the Bing
search page we can you go over here and
be some more we can also be their latest
Twitter and Facebook feeds and we can
also get more information on how to
learn how to use the device tunein radio
is a free application to vote on the
windows marketplace that allows you to
listen to practically any broadcast
radio station and we can also search
using genre name or location so let's
say they don't want to find local radio
off just click on the local radio tab so
now I can listen to any local radio
station so let's choose one of these
let's try this one right here and wait
for that to load so now we can listen to
that radio station we can add it to our
presets and we can also view the lineup
for the upcoming broadcast a schedule I
love katamari is a paid for xbox live
game which costs six dollars and
ninety-nine cents on the windows
marketplace so the author of the game is
to roll over these odds roll over these
various objects and pick them up so you
increase the size of your cut Amar'e and
what you want to do is to make it large
enough that you would be able to pick up
the object that's predetermined by this
guy in the beginning so right now I'm
trying to make it large enough so I can
pick up
act and once I've done that I beat the
level when I can move on to the next
playing field parachute panic is a paid
for Xbox Live game doctors game is to
maneuver your parachuting people onto
their platform down here so what you
want to do is make sure you tap on here
to release the parachute and you can use
wind and other air currents to blow your
guy over here and want to make him land
on that ship the game continues on more
and more increasingly difficult as it
goes on and what you want to do is you
want to avoid these other things and you
also owe it becomes way more challenging
and I just got eaten by a shark so this
has been another episode of the windows
phone 7 app round up if you like our
videos make sure you go as a thumbs up
and I'll sleeve some comments down below
to get the download information for all
these applications just visit the link
of the description to get regular
Pacquiao's website where we stored the
zune links or you can also use the
microsoft tags and just snap a picture
using microsoft tag and it will take you
to the application on the marketplace
