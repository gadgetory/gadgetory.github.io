man one screen just isn't enough if so
LG's fall follow-up flagship might just
be the phone for you i'm michael fisher
with pocket now here with a first look
at the LG v10 it might not be as
straightforward a name as the proline it
replaces but anyone who follows engines
knows of v10 is a pretty big beast and
so is this phone it masses almost 200
grams and its casing is made of a
scratch resistant silicon built atop a
316l stainless steel frame and etched
with a crosshatch pattern for added grip
the material plus the mass make the v10
feel almost like it's designed for a
construction site but at eight point six
millimeters thick it's nowhere near as
chunky as one of those the most LG will
guarantee is that it will hold up to a
four foot drop and the flexibility of
the backplate makes me believe it
underneath is a removable 3000 milliamp
hour battery and a microSD expansion
slot which can take the 64 gigs of
on-board storage up to an additional two
terabytes if you want to get spendy the
most noticeable of the v10 s assets is
its so-called second screen 160 by 1040
extension of the main display at the top
of the phone it's actually part of the
same physical panel which is a big
bright IPS quantum display at quad HD
resolution but the second screen is
controlled by an independent display
driver and back light controller which
allows it to act independently of the
main display in some ways this is really
handy unless you disable it the second
screen stays lit all the time showing
you the date and time and you're waiting
notifications or if you prefer a custom
signature there's also some intelligent
use of the added space here for camera
shortcuts and convenience toggles which
are meant to help you do things like
multitask and control music playback
without needing to power up the rest of
that big 5.7 inch display that's smart
but the second screens location at the
top of the display is puzzling I'd like
to have seen it placed below the screen
to make for easier one hand
use we'll see how it goes when the time
comes for a full review alongside that
second screen is another of the v10
setoffs dual front-facing cameras that
can provide a wide-angle selfie of up to
a hundred and twenty degrees with their
powers combined we've seen wide-angle
selfies like that before
but the use of two sensors instead of a
single wide-angle lens
lets the v10 avoid the fishbowl effect
and it makes for some fun viewfinder
tricks too if you fire up all three
cameras simultaneously the main camera
is the same as on the g4 which means
it's one of the best if not the best
camera currently available on a
mainstream Android smartphone video is
the central focus of this device now you
can specify framerate ISO and aspect
ratio and you can tell it which of the
phone's three microphones you want to
emphasize for audio pickup there's also
a wind filter built into the software to
make outdoor recording a little easier
it's that pro level stuff that really
impresses me LG makes a big deal out of
the phone's ability to auto generate
highlight videos for social sharing and
so on but that's nothing really new as
far as the landscape as a whole is
concerned the v10 goes on sale in Korea
this month and in the US come November
with other markets following thereafter
it will be available in five colors and
we know at least one model will be
coming to Verizon Wireless it'll launch
with Android lollipop overlaid with LG's
custom skin and the company told us to
expect a marshmallow update early next
year yeah it's a little disappointing
but with a snapdragon 808 4 gigs of ram
the top shelf cameras and a fancy
display bringing some fun features this
looks to be a much more exciting phone
than its g pro predecessors ever were
somewhat clunky design aside LG might
just have itself a fall flagship worth
drooling over to find out for sure keep
your eyes on pocket now in the coming
weeks for our full review
be sure to check out our other hands-on
from today also from LG the first
Android wear SmartWatch with a cellular
radio and buttons lots of buttons be
sure to follow pocket now on social
media and follow me at captain 2 phones
until next time this has been michael
fisher from new york city thanks for
watching
we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
