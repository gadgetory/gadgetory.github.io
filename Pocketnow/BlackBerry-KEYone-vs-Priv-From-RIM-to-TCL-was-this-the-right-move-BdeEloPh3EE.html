the top phones requested for a
comparison was unsurprisingly
the Pres less a proper comparison which
phone is more worth it for the money but
more a way to gauge the evolution of
this brand there's something poetic
about examining the last phone made by
BlackBerry's Hardware team and the first
QWERTY phone made by partner TCL so are
we on the right track the BlackBerry
name carries a reputation for business
grade communication gear durable
professional the key one design executes
this idea wonderfully the metal frame
and grippy back is my personal favorite
combination of materials and I haven't
been this happy with the feel of a phone
since the Galaxy Note 4 the printer
Tinley looks the part and this rear
material has a great texture to it but
the BlackBerry built phone manages to
feel a little more fragile the slight
screen shift from the slider or the
easily depressed backplate after some
terrific hardware experiments the
privilege that last little bit of polish
we would have expected from this company
immediately we should look at the
signature feature for both phones the
hardware keyboards and there are many
similarities capacitive sensors allow
for trackpad like scrolling and each key
can be customized for shortcuts in
operation on my to review phones the key
travel on the key one feels more
consistent especially on the border keys
which have a bit more click than on the
Prive the extra engineering on the
spacebar is appreciated to where the
prints pace bar feels downright mushy by
comparison key one is an all-around
improvement and this hardware is used
more consistently throughout the phone's
UI the only criticism it's pretty easy
to accidentally activate the capacitive
controls right above your Hardware keys
especially when scrolling and this is
where the prison philosophy suffers
sliding the keyboard away we wonder how
many people bought this phone and only
occasionally use its signature Hardware
feature like the folks who used to buy
the note for the larger screen and
rarely used the s-pen previous
blackberries were organ Amish champions
but the prints appeal to everyone
execution is somewhat inelegant this is
a really tall gadget to be using on the
go
the Priven icer screen though
higher resolution and a contrast the
AMOLED panel but this might be
contributing to the power and throttling
issues driving more dots on the display
the key ones LCD is no slouch readable
in sunlight and with a respectable pixel
density for its 4.5 inch diagonal my
main gripe for both phones curved glass
on the edges of both displays makes
fitting a glass screen protector more
difficult I know business people like
pretty design accents but a flat front
face would be more practical for the
intended audience
moving to the tech inside blackberry
made their move to Android during one of
the worst years for Qualcomm chipsets
companies with more resources and
experience and optimizing for Android
managed better operation out of the
Qualcomm 808 but blackberries struggled
the privy I often to the point of
inconsistent performance and throttling
by contrast the key one looks less
impressive on paper with a mid tier
processor but TCL makes far better use
of this hardware no one would accuse the
key one of being a speed demon but it's
easy to get a feel and an expectation
for how we'll perform which apps might
take an extra second to load when the
privy is cool it's faster but the swing
in throttled performance is far more
noticeable than the occasional stutter
you might find on key one optimization
is critical and TCL is significantly
better equipped to maximize the use of
this hardware neither phone is a
multimedia champ headphone output is
more than adequate for phone calls but
ranks low for music and movie playback
the Prince Kors a significant victory
for speaker tech simply for pointing the
speaker in the right direction with this
forehead and TCL's expertise we were
hoping for at least a mono front firing
solution on the key one
the camera battle is also nuanced
overall I prefer the still shots from
the key one using a slightly larger
sensor with a lower resolution and a
faster aperture the prim score is a
handy victory for video however while
both phones can shoot UHD footage the
Priven Offit's significantly from
Hardware stabilization
lastly the battery contest is no contest
the key one absolutely demolishes the
Priven benching and in real-world use
again consistency is key I can count on
the newer phone to last at least two
full days of moderate use sometimes the
probe is well-behaved lasting to
dinnertime and other times my pocket
feels like it's about to ignite and the
phone is dead before lunch
each phone's performance is mirrored and
recharging the key one consistently
charges quickly and stays cooler
regardless of what you task it with
while plugged in the probe will
sometimes stop off quickly but often it
will trickle charge especially if
anything is running in the background
see I like to upload my photos to cloud
storage when the phone is plugged in and
connected to Wi-Fi which happens to be a
perfect recipe to kill the probe
routinely after about 20 minutes on a
charger I'd find I'd actually lost a few
battery percentage points and if your
phone starts updating apps you can
forget about topping off the battery so
let's wrap this up how far have we come
in moving from the Prive to the key one
you know blackberry is doing better
quite a bit better the prints failure
might have been in trying to do too much
a bigger screen for multimedia tucking
the keyboard away out of sight and
delivering that during the darkest days
of a terrible chipset generation from
Qualcomm what's exciting here blackberry
and TCL seem to have learned from that
misstep newer Android powered phones
benefit from more specific focus instead
of trying to dump everything into one
handset DTAC offers a more powerful
chipset and a bigger screen while key
one focuses on marathon use and killer
communication features this is the right
way to go key one emits a few of the fun
features I like on other handsets to
deliver an
focus on communication and productivity
this is fantastic progress and it would
seem the BlackBerry brand is in good
hands as always thanks so much for
