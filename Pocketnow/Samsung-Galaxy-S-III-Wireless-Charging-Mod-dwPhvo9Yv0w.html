a wireless charger for its American and
galaxy s3 customers but suppose you're
not the waiting type suppose you want
wireless charging on your Galaxy s3
right now okay I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow will show you how to do it
now because this mod depends on
exploiting the wireless charging
hardware found in the old palm pixi
you're gonna need some specialized
equipment but it's easily come by an
Amazon or Ebay and it shouldn't run you
any more than 30 to 40 bucks tops we
should also mention here that this mod
comes to us via an xda-developers thread
by member Android 9 for 301 and that
pocket now is not liable for any
warranty violations device losses or
explosions that might occur we've thrown
the source link in the description of
this video if you want more detailed
information and some excellent pointers
and tips here's what you're gonna need
copper tape rare earth magnets or small
metal disks a palm pixi inductive
battery door a palm touchstone charger a
palm a USB cable with AC adapter yes it
has to be the palm cable because the
touch tone has a finicky port that only
accepts certain shapes don't cheap out
on this tape and your Galaxy s3 the
first thing we want to do is pull the
tape off the back of the pixi case and
set it aside then we're going to gently
remove and set aside the circuit board
silver metallic tape coil and the metal
disks next to preserve the positions of
the disks in the coils Center we cut a
crude template out of paper and marked
their positions you can do this more
precisely with a drill and some shears
if you prefer but we want our wireless
charging now so we're already cutting
corners this probably won't come back to
bite us in the bud right next we pull
the battery cover off our galaxy s3 and
insert the pixies charging coil upside
down in this orientation we secure the
circuit board to the battery cover with
some tape you can use hot glue or
superglue later on once you've decided
on positioning and then we fold the
connector ribbon back on itself like so
so we have access to the contacts next
we'll drop our paper template over the
coil to give us position information for
our magnets now if you're worried about
messing up the phone's compass with
magnetic fields you should use the metal
discs we pried from the pixi before
we're using magnets in this example so
we'll be sure to check the polarity to
make sure we're putting them down in an
attractive not a repulsive attitude you
can check polarity and positioning on
the touchstone itself now you'll want to
do this repeatedly as you're taping the
magnets in to make sure the alignment is
good and also very important make sure
the magnets aren't too thick otherwise
you'll never get the battery door back
on the phone once the magnets are in
position we'll bring our silver tape
back from the palm pixi pile and retype
it onto the coil thusly then we secure
it with more scotch tape like so at this
point you should consider trimming away
all the excess tapes you don't feel like
a slob and so this mod starts to look
just a little less amateurish if you're
a real pro you can bring the black palm
label back into play here but be mindful
again of the thickness of the battery
door it still needs to attach to the
phone after all speaking of the phone
now's a good time to line up our
components so we can keep an eye on the
big picture we're trying to get the
charging terminals on the phone to
connect to the terminals on our Palm
ribbon to do that we need to use our
copper tape we'll cut the copper tape
into manageable lengths ranging from
about 1/8 to 1/2 inch in width so we can
create two big landing zones on the
phone one for positive one for negative
obviously we'll take care that the two
zones don't touch to get a good contact
on the phone's connectors we'll use a
blunt object to tap the tape firmly down
on them careful though they're fragile
if you have trouble later with
connectivity you might want to try
putting the tape in copper side down the
adhesive side may not be as conductive
we had to try several times before we
get a firm connection a voltmeter is
helpful if you have one at this point
maybe we'll take the battery out of the
phone so we don't blow our kitchen up
maybe do this beforehand folks once we
have our phone side landing pads ready
we'll move to the battery cover and
prepare them similarly using the same
copper tape also making sure to keep
positive and negative separate and
making sure to line them up so that when
the back is replaced everything will
touch like it needs to we doubled up the
tape in the overlapping spots to ensure
contact when all said and done you
should have something that looks
something like
this don't like hopefully prettier
because this is ugly as sin will resist
the urge to judge a book by its cover
though let's snap the battery back in
and slap the battery cover back on you
will notice an unsightly bulge on ours
and that's due to those thick magnets we
used if you go with the metal disks from
the pixie instead of thicker magnets
that shouldn't be an issue well the
phone is powering up we'll plug in our
touchstone and say a quick prayer before
dropping our Galaxy s3 on the touchstone
for its first wireless charging
experience that's gonna do it for
today's tutorial if you tried it on your
Galaxy s3 leave a comment let us know
how it went and leave tips for other
folks who give it a try thanks for
watching follow us in the links in the
description below and we'll see you next
time
