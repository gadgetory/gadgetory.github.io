quite a while since the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus was announced and released and
while the accessories have been
trickling in smoothly finally all of the
accessories are now available and yes
that includes the vehicle dock which I
have in my hand let's go ahead and unbox
it
see if it was worth the wait so we've
got the Samsung Galaxy Nexus a vehicle
dock kit which includes the dock phone
is not included and the power adapter
let's go ahead and open it up and take a
look I've already cut this and make it
easier on camera opening this up we've
got this kind of flimsy plastic stuff
let's look at the power cord will open
up in this little lies Ziploc bag
now this plugs into your 12-volt DC also
known as a cigarette lighter adapter in
your car as the Samsung name brand right
there really slim profile it's even got
this nice little gooseneck in it and
some finger grabs to help you pull it
out when that time comes spring loaded
tip spring loaded ears looks pretty good
and I really like that gooseneck next
you've got a relatively long length of
cord I don't know exactly how long but
it looks like it should easily reach
just about anywhere on your dash so
there you go four times whatever that is
and then on the other end we've got a
kind of a Samsung branded micro USB port
that has the little offset to the cable
helps removing it a little bit easier a
little easier to handhold and next what
we're all waiting for the manual right
there yes there's a manual yes it is
that thick if you need that much of a
manual Wow
why do they think we need that
so let's move right onto the dock first
of all it looks terrible now that's
because it's got all of this protective
film on it which honestly takes forever
to remove it all so there is everything
off the base I've got one off of the USB
or excuse me that the Bluetooth right
and that one takes a little bit of time
to get off these guys if you work them
out from the middle and pull down you're
good and once all of that is off
you're good to go now the dock actually
looks really really nice you've got a
matte finish up here and everything else
is kind of a glossy finish show you the
suction right there that's the the
suction cup I like to add a little bit
of moisture to this I'll take and use a
a nice alcohol wipe to clean not only
this off but also the windshield that
I'm going to attach it to not included
like like they had with the Nexus One
car dock if you remember that next
you've got this little guy and now this
is your suction actuator if I de read
the manual I probably could tell you the
real name but once you have it in place
you hold it firmly against the
windshield and push that down and that
actuates the nice little suction right
there by pulling the middle plunger out
and creating that suction effect you
guys know how a suction cup works and
then of course we've got a nice little
help to pull this off the windshield to
to move it around tab right there over
on the side we've got a an audio port
just takes a regular headphone jack and
you can plug that in to your car stereo
and then your micro USB port now
that hold it up is where you're going to
plug in your power just like that if
it's really well I'm a little bit
confused that they didn't put a right
angle on this because it's gonna attach
to the windshield if the windshields
over here it's going to attach like this
and then this is gonna run down so it
wouldn't make sense if they made that
into a little atleast a 45 or a 90
degree connector rather than a straight
but you know Who am I
so let's go ahead and take a look
somewhere I said that it's gonna mount
to the windshield like this okay so if
you're looking at it there you go look
like that now inside you've got a few
things first you've got a big hole in
the back and that is to accommodate your
camera and your flash we line that up
see works really well you've also got
this hole on the top that's for your
noise cancellation microphone which is
right there so you still get that
advantage down here on the bottom you've
got another hole that is for your
speaker just like that now you'll notice
I've got a little chin here on the the
bottom of the Galaxy Nexus GSM but I
don't have a mating chin on the inside
of the actual dock now what that means
is I can put an extended battery or a
phone with an extended battery into the
documental fit just fine it is very very
very tight I mean ridiculously so but
we'll get to that in just a minute next
down here on the bottom I don't know if
you can see this or not there's actually
another hole that doesn't go all the way
through and that is for your microphone
I don't know where it goes
honestly there's a little indentation
and nothing weird but over on the top we
have a volume up and a volume down
button and all that does is it passes
through to the inside of the dock so
just little actuators there I like that
word today down on the bottom we've got
the power button which again does the
same thing it just passes the press up
through the frame into the the button so
it doesn't do anything special or talk
to be a bluetooth or anything like that
to do your button presses and then what
everybody is waiting for the pogo pins
right there you can see the three little
gold pins and those made up really
nicely with the three little gold
contacts on the phone so let's see how
this thing well before we do that you
can take this and you can rotate it
loosen this guy up and up down around
around whatever just like that right
and tighten it down wherever you want it
so you can do it in landscape and it
looks really nice in landscape if I can
get all the way over there you can't do
it in portrait we'll go ahead and leave
it in portrait for now but make sure you
loosen up that that nut on the back it
makes me a lot easier than trying to
just bend it around so once you've done
that you take your phone put it in pogo
pins first and once that's I like
putting my thumb right here and there's
actually a little bump out that you can
use as a reference and then you just
press once that is done this whole unit
becomes very very uniform it looks like
it is an installed accessory not just a
phone in a dock to get it out you need a
little bit of pressure again a pair I'm
pushing through the backplate through
that hole and you just pop it out the
first several times you do this it is
going to be very very tight now you're
asking Joe how can you know that you
just got this phone either just or you
just got this dock and you just unboxed
it well I cheated a little bit I got to
I got one for me and one for my spouse
we both have the Galaxy Nexus phones so
I put mine in my phone yesterday or my
mine in my car yesterday and then I've
been putting my phone into the dock
yesterday and today so very kind of cool
now you do need to have Android 4.0.4 to
be able to take advantage of all the
docking features especially that
bluetooth pass-through but to get just
the regular charging all you need is
your phone and the dock and a USB to 2
power connection so anyway there it is
it's very nice it's a very very snug but
once its installed
it looks beautiful so if you held out
for this I highly recommend it it's very
nice and it's going to do everything
that you want in a car dock and then
some especially because you won't have
to plug in any external power every time
you dock and undock the other phone from
the adaptor it is
available from expanses but it's also
available from directly from the Google
Play Store as well so you can go ahead
and get it straight from there they
should be rolling out there shouldn't be
any waiting period that you have to go
through so orders should be filled
relatively quickly what do you think let
