iphone 5s up their sleeve specs of the
Samsung Galaxy gear reveal what to
expect and yeah believe it or not
Nokia's building a windows RT tablet I'm
high memory beta and trust me I wouldn't
like Windows RT even if it were friday
and i were drunk which I'm about to but
this is out daily let's start a
up with the official news those of you
interested in the Moto X while it will
be available first on AT&amp;amp;T on august
twenty-third but if you're interested in
customizing your phone the Moto maker
service will be available on the 19th
for you to customize your phone and then
get it four days later on the
twenty-third and if those of you
interested in the HTC One on verizon
which is finally available you can pick
it up on artist 22nd as well now let's
talk about Apple on the official site
iOS 7 beta 6 is now available for
developers only that it this is mostly
just for bug fixes nothing really major
so far even though it's getting closer
to launch date and aside from that even
though we had heard about the rumors of
a golden iphone that we really didn't
believe now we finally get a photograph
of a golden iPhone and fix to wonder
what market this is destined for
specifically if they're actually
planning also to serve three different
colors of phone so stay tuned for that
and remember those sony camera lenses
that we talked about a couple of days
ago well we finally get the user manuals
of this camera and we learned a lot of
things first of all i didn't mention
that right these are cameras stand-alone
cameras that don't need the phone to
operate they've got their own battery
they've got just about everything it's
just interesting though that if you use
the phone it'll actually allow to use
the viewfinder but this lens is actually
heavier than the Xperia Z in its own so
well anyways Lex in the description for
the full manuals and details on what to
expect sadly no dates just yet but Aoife
is being rumored and even though we had
dismissed the rumors of Nokia building a
windows tablet well we finally get the
first league photograph of it and even
aside from the pink color that you see
there we do get some specifications that
include an arm-based processor which is
not necessarily good news because this
would necessarily have to be a Windows
RT tablet and judging by the fact that
when those RT is so hated everywhere
um that's not going to sound good for
nokia and finally for the hot news of
the day we get some leaked
specifications of the samsung galaxy
gear smartwatch and they are actually
good i'm not going to bore you with the
specifics on processor or anything the
hot news here is that this is not going
to be a parasite of your phone this is
going to be a phone yeah the SmartWatch
is actually going to allow you to make
phone calls just like Tracy pretty much
which is kind of interesting I mean I
can't imagine the option of having a
SmartWatch and leaving my smartphone at
home but anyways that leads you to this
question of the day would that be a
feature that you'd be interested in your
watch I mean think about it having a
SmartWatch that can make phone calls
again in my particular case the problem
is that that SmartWatch won't be able to
help me navigate the internet so I would
still have to carry a smartphone and it
begs to wonder if both these products
can coexist unless you leave the
smartphone in home for its habit so
leave us a comment down below would you
like this functionality and of course is
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tell the world miss you
