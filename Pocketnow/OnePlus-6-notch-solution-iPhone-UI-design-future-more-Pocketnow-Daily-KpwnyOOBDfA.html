knotch situation or at least provide an
alternative the iPhone can probably get
curvy and adopt some new gestures and a
few generations and Xiaomi seems to be
working on a gaming phone or some sort
of a gaming brand solution I'm Jaime
Rivera and it's great to be back home in
Studio number two we've got a lot to
cover this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals
that are a little hard to believe but
we're way off April Fool's here
apparently you get half off any pixel to
a pixel to excel phone you get a Google
home Mini in addition to a chromecast
apparently you can also get up to two
months of free YouTube TV and all this
for trading but the funny part about the
post and I would highly suggest you
follow the link in the description we
still don't have the list of what you
can trade in or not from Google so you
can learn more in the description again
as soon as we get the full information
their official news have to do with
deals to a certain degree first of all
well the honour view 10 is now available
on Amazon for $4.99 it's probably one of
the phones that expect our video coming
very soon on this device there's a lot
of good here it's pretty much a huawei
mate 10 Pro which is one of our favorite
phones from last year with another
chassis and a better price tag and then
if you're into more deals there's a
another option in the description where
you can get an honor 7x with a catch for
$1 yeah I know learn more in the
description now let's talk about Xiaomi
and a company called Black Shark which
is pretty much backed by Xiaomi as we
hear that they're working on a gaming
phone to be announced probably on April
13th they're already present bytes for
Beijing the whole idea here is that
we've got a full-blown gaming phone with
a snapdragon 845 and apparently some
sort of a solution for liquid cooling in
addition to the possibility of separate
discreet graphics from Nvidia I can't
wait to see exactly what that's gonna be
I'll keep you posted on that one as well
I've got some sketchy reports from a
trusted source
Bloomberg talking about you know the
future of iPhones and exactly where
things are going
apparently Cupertino is working hard on
R&amp;amp;D with a couple of things that have
become gimmicks in the past for other
companies like Samsung with the whole
interact with their phone without
touching
apparently that's one of the things
we're getting in addition terribly the
display is going to arc in the top of
the bottom in a weird way and get a lot
curvier it seems that you know Apple is
very famous for prototyping different
ideas and eventually just coming out
with the most conservative one and
that's gonna be your next iPhone but it
seems that this is a long term project
that could work for the next three years
probably so we'll see in the end cuz you
know Cupertino they again they do a lot
of stuff in prototypes and then we don't
end up getting all of that and finally
the most interesting news is they have
to do with the one plus six that is
being rumored it seems that it's pretty
much everything that we've seen with the
Opel ar-15 Pro that's going to make a
jump into the one plus six in design
meaning you'd get a notch at the top and
well we had tweets from Karl pay and
everything and then there was some
controversy and that apparently the
tweet was pulled that we had to embrace
the notch apparently there's going to be
a software solution that will pretty
much hide the knotch if you don't want
to see it it'll obviously make you lose
screen real estate according to Peter
Lao but yeah if you don't want to deal
with the notches there's a way to just
make it all dark I kind of think that
while we did that same thing with the
p20 Pro but anyways in today's question
let us know let's assume you do go for
the one plus six are you going to hide
the notch with software or are you going
to embrace more screen real estate in my
case I've I'll deal with the notch
that's just me leave us a comment down
