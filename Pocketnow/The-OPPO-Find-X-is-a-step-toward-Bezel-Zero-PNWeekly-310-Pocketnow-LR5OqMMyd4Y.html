winner of 27 global awards that now
comes with Windows hello among your
huawei mate book X Pro with a touch of
your fingerprint so here fast and no
password to remember for a limited time
you get a 3 $300 gift card with purchase
visit a Microsoft store near you today
and we are live one Australian state is
considering banning students from using
smartphones meanwhile back in China were
staring into the bezel Asst of this and
wondering what it is well just what is
it because the picture sure doesn't
really tell its own story also is Apple
capable of releasing anything that's not
an iPhone iPad or Mac but on time new
cameras really have to be over-engineer
to avoid punching and najin tear faces
and what the heck is HT what no 8 HGTV
know IG TV that's right
and why is PocketNow involved in your
homing gardening needs I guess we'll
have some answers for you as well as a
lot of conversation this week on the
pocket now weekly recorded live on this
June 22nd it's a Friday 5:00 p.m.
Eastern and I'm here I'm Jules long we
are here to discuss all the things that
relate to mobile technology from
smartphones to tablets smart watches and
everything in between the stuff that you
would imagine you'd have as a kid my
name again is tickle Swan and that was
an introduction I am going to introduce
Jaime Rivera or multimedia manager in
hopefully a few minutes as he tries to
get along to his bodega for a little bit
of recording and in the meantime we have
my friend colleague from Android police
Ryan Hagar hello to you in Boston hello
to you Jules
hey what's been up recently and we
haven't talked in a while so I was just
hoping that we could I mean this is kind
of like the pre catch up because we've
actually
schedule a brunch tomorrow cell but I
was just wondering how you've been I've
been good I've been good
I mean news is slowed down we're in June
there's not a whole lot going on but a
lot of speculation for you know upcoming
phones anticipating Samsung's deal is
the melodrama
yeah totally the melodrama has kind of
increased even for like just like a more
you know kind of filler type of stories
just because I mean it's the fact that
we are in doldrum mode here yeah early
stories is the slow season but
nonetheless there's been a couple of
interesting things percolating out few
new phone releases there was the HTC you
12 well lost and whatever that name
really means I mean we had a fan we had
an advocate of that phone actually on
last week's show because how did you
find one well you just have to know a
few friends that's all you must have
asked quite a few people just like I
asked him to be on the sharing and he
just came up with that point to find to
find someone who's willing to add holy
it's like you know I asked about 15,000
people and it specifically invited that
one person the only one to participate
on the show because we are all in the
pockets of HTC not sponsored just
wanting a quick second to promote our
hashtag be and weekly we want to get a
conversation going on whoever later
topics this episode and that is the talk
about Australia specifically New South
Wales the government they're looking
into a study on the how kids use their
phones in school so from kindergarten
all the way up to 12th grade they do and
how should they tailor their policies
for smartphone use on campus so if you
when I talk about that deep snoring
Twitter hash tag PN weekly and in any
other case you can actually just talk
about what we're talking about as we're
doing it live at five o'clock on a
Friday however if you can't make it live
if you really just want to get a
question out there and have an answered
or you just have to eat pots and
you can email them to us we're a podcast
at pocketnow.com I met a target I'll
have to admit apologize for any
background noise from the blended drinks
at the Starbucks around the corner
cleaning she literally and sweet
children bouncing balls like no I
totally get it
I'm pretty much bothering this space too
just by continuously talking for the
next hour so I kind of feel bad myself
but what I'm gonna do I'm here I'm kind
of in this position and I don't really
have any other alternatives at this
point so we're doing this baby all right
let's see what do we talk about first
how about let's talk about something
that's visual um if you want to refer to
your rundown it's linked in the
description of whatever podcasting app
you're doing I just want you to look at
this because this is a it's interesting
okay beauty and I won't be able to share
it on the screen here because it'd be
awkward but in any case so recently we
saw this on Weibo pop-up I believe it
was from that renowned tech analyst ice
universe or something like that it could
be it was ice universe and he posted it
on Twitter actually so this was kind of
a cross-platform promotion kind of thing
and it was just a this picture have an
iPhone 10 like thing or like a Galaxy S
10 thing in the very basically no bezels
there's there's like an edge effect kind
of screen going on and there's the cool
lot of gloss and very few little
business like if uniform goes around the
curves around the corners and people
were amazed
now the beyond word this is that this
may be a design beyond that was the
tagline that he used there the beyond
tagline or the moniker has been
associated with the project code-named
that samsung is using for next year's
galaxy s 10 or whatever it to be called
so about people have been
seeing this with hey this could be
coming in 2019 now I know Ryan that you
spoke to me before today about what your
convictions are about this picture
so haven't what do you think so I looked
at in it's a pretty good detail
I obviously did it was posted to Twitter
so there's it's not the original image
so I wasn't able to like play with the
levels and see if there was anything
nefarious going on it's compressed but
that is without a doubt the body of a
galaxy s 9 the button placement and the
shapes the exposed little bit of metal
on the bottom everything about it
physically excluding the screen is a
galaxy s 9 there's also something weird
going on with the reflections going up
the sides in the top-left corner I'm I'm
fairly convinced that this isn't real
and this is a shot it just looks like
somebody put a big screen on s-sorry top
left corner relative to the original
image read it in the vertical position
yeah yeah there's something weird about
that reflection if there's no it just
stops it doesn't the glass should curve
unless it's like a harsh edge there and
there's there's something weird going on
I mean we don't have any light sources
that we can just turn this and yeah like
what lots of it's left to the
imagination just because it's just one
image and that you don't see any other
aspects to it certainly true but it is
exactly the body of an s9 button
placement it's pixel perfect I mean it
wasn't was it the case for the galaxy is
like the essay in an asinine pretty much
not the same actually to my knowledge
the and as so far as I've been able to
telex I actually haven't played with
either phone um the button placement did
change slightly on the s8 to the s9
there's there's a little bit of tweaking
that after basically the same spot but
it's not pixel perfect like this so
Stanley
if this is an s10 it's the first time
I've known that Samsung has done this
exact consistent placement between
generations interesting well if we want
to be able to incorporate our friend
that just joined the show Jaime Rivera
hello to you salutations and hopefully
traffic wasn't too bad and
it's horrible hello oh but wait a second
I forgot my key - I'll be right back
here we go
here we're gonna have an impromptu
hands-on segment it's gonna be amazing
and the show will go over by like 30
minutes so we're gonna have a fun time
with that I think but in any case yeah I
mean there was this kind of addendum to
it is universe later posted a lot of the
repo stories so everyone every occasion
we didn't get to it until Friday because
we wanted well because we wanted to let
it settle down first but yeah to catch
this yes hey we're pretty good we're
pretty happening at this point just a
norm to that our exposure here
microphones on everything is set we're
all in like hey have you been behaving
chills day out I have your your house or
your apartment with with kindness and
I've also given out somehow out to your
sister's son so that's great - completed
good how does a life in the United
States I'm currently enjoying the
beauties of Latin America we're pretty
happy here we are live just to make sure
that you don't worry too much
information here about and I can go into
like three day tour about what I've been
doing in New York
but yeah I was briefed enough to lend me
his sister's apartment for a few days
and very grateful again good I'm trying
to re rail us and get us back on this
Long Island Rail Road Express train -
fizzled or bezel-less stuff I guess you
could say so I should never walk back
just a little bit it seems like on his
way low page or their way book page and
here's the trail loose translation of
what they said foreign media is arguing
whether this is a real gut cs10 but my
take is that this
and I guess a hand of cards figuratively
speaking is worth raising this device
can be said to have flown out of the
country to the international stage this
device has all sorts of black magic and
cutting-edge equipment in it and may set
an international standard so kind of
embellishing things around it gods
concept it's a concept design it's a
concept design I don't think the
technology is ready for us to get a
phone that has so little bezels like
that thing literally has absolutely no
protection around the borders and like
we know that there is a need for the
connector for the OLED so unless they
figure out a way to flip with which I I
know that Samsung can totally just you
know OLED turn it around and pull what
Apple did with the iPhone 10 but I don't
know man yeah having an extra bit of
that display tucked under it so that the
connector can be hit in holding the
controller with a flexible substrate no
need for to show that controller off
with the chin so I mean that's the hope
then perhaps I mean Samsung if this is
Samsung's they control their displays
and they control very much all most a
lot of aspects including silicon on
their devices so I mean if it's anyone
that may be able to do it could be
Samsung but let's move on from this and
talk about another little hot little
topic what is that that's he said I mean
I'm in target and there's a there's a
there's a parenting thing going on over
there right now and daddy Starbucks and
plunders Starbucks and if you were here
earlier bouncing balls this is the life
man I mean if you want to be on the road
and do things and you know together you
have to make everything happen let's not
delay any further and talk about delays
let's talk about Apple and in its
inability to kind of get things straight
as it
Genda or like maybe an air pod home pod
and then the reality sets in engineers
find trouble here trouble there with the
components are software and just well in
general I mean we've been talking about
iOS 11 and 10 and how they've been
crashy buggy messes and it still doesn't
seem like it means just spread all over
they're still trying to figure that out
so I'm wondering how you guys feel about
reports about air power which is their
multi device wireless charging panel
concept still concept because it hasn't
been released yeah I don't know man the
moment I saw air power one of the first
things that I thought was oh my god I
have this I have to link bracelet on my
Apple watch and I'm like how am I gonna
lay my Apple watch with the link
bracelet on that pad
you just can't it wasn't designed for
that unless you're using their their
loops or their their rub the the
whatever material rubber or whatever it
is the polyurethane I think it is fans
unless you're using that you're not
gonna be able to use that thing so
honestly I mean I guess a lot of people
have been making like a big deal over
the fact that that pad has been delayed
I'm sure that thing is gonna be so
expensive that I would rather buy like
five different wireless chargers that I
could set in just around different parts
of my room anyways so for me it's like
I'm just giving you my personal opinion
I honestly don't care like I feel that
just launching a larger battery chart
battery a battery pad is is yeah I'm
sure that for some people that only have
one iPhone and one Apple watch with the
polyurethane band and and their airports
yeah I'm sure that they're gonna be
happy but yeah you know they delay it
and whatever like I mean ton
there are a ton of really good wireless
chargers out there right now like Sarah
Hart
yeah like speaking for example Diego
give me a second give me a second do
well he's editing in the daily sorry but
I have I have this wireless charger from
spigen which supports the fast wireless
protocol
that we've seen from Samsung it is
really good like there are just so many
options out there right now and I'm sure
that they're not gonna have the Apple
tack so it's like whatever yeah it's
gonna be so expensive you'd bet the
price difference won't be worth the fact
you could pick up three or four generic
ones and have three or four charges
instead
exactly exactly like I've got like to
show me one of the those wireless
charging pucks from Xiaomi I have two of
those and over here in the bedroom I
have one in the desk over there I like
in the apartment in New York I've got
three lined up and you know I am sure
that all those seven wireless chargers
are gonna be cheaper than Apple's
anyways so I think I mean I'm totally
glad that we're kind of dismissing the
hardware at hand I mean so why even
bother with this kind of a show of force
with the air power I mean if it's going
to cause delays if it's going to take up
this much manpower anyways then why even
bother because I know that we've been
talking about or the big deal that has
been made about this improvement or
recently I guess is that you know
Apple's aiming for a buttonless port
this iPhone and that this is the way in
for them this is the way that they can
brand themselves but it's like I don't
buy it's like well sure if that's I
guess has been there always their vision
Johnny I've their head of design has
said no less than that like well where
does this land because this does not
really it doesn't make sense to me well
it makes sense to me from the
perspective that the more connectors you
have on a phone it's more difficult to
make it water resistant so bear in mind
the more the more components in a
product the more difficult it is to
manufacture the more margin of error you
have for it to you know for it to break
in anyway it's it during the
manufacturing process oh it adds more
complexity and also making the water
resistant so for me it makes a lot of
sense for companies to consider the idea
of moving away from ports completely if
they can like I
like if the plan is for four ports to be
removed in order to make the
manufacturing process faster great now I
actually covered the news in the daily
over the rumors that Apple really wanted
to do it through the iPhone 10 for me
because the iPhones in it was such a
breaking product like before and after I
think I would have made a lot of sense
for the company to figure it out but
according to the according to the rumors
it seems that you know just a lot of I
guess the test pilot consumers that they
got the show the product or I don't know
what but according to the rumors its
consumers were gonna have a lot of
issues with you know you're already
killing the headphone jack you're you
know you're also gonna kill this port as
well and you're not gonna you're not
gonna add some air pods into the box and
probably one of the main selling points
of the iPhone ever since generation one
is hey we're including a pair of really
good headphones which you know what are
you gonna connect them to I would the
future be that the iPhone 10 2018 or
next years will bring no ports and a
pack of air pods could be I mean I feel
that that would be great but there are
there were other challenges with that
with that premise the other one is
obviously the fact that wireless
charging is horrendous ly slow
horrendous ly slow and like in the case
of Apple products they don't support the
faster charging that we see on Galaxy
phones which is not significantly faster
but it is faster so and so think about
it I mean it's not like if you've got
this amazing battery life on the iPhone
10 and you're also going to you're gonna
force me to use a wireless charger which
means I can't use my phone while it's
charging unless I look like really
ridiculous while holding it here and
there or like on Apple pencil levels of
charging light and slow but I want to
give one last thought because I do want
to move on to Ryan here because in terms
of what we've seen is it's the only
Didion about Apple is that they're
always they're not always the first but
they're always better at producing a
product and you know piece but in recent
times especially with like the side
projects you could say that about the
air part
it's I don't know if you could say that
about the home
especially because of Siri I mean they
were first to that but it was seriously
I was involved yeah so what do you think
about apples kind of side branches here
and kind of letting it on a wither on
the vine
I don't know cuz it has been ten months
since they announced they were gonna do
it and they still haven't done it I
honestly I can't couldn't even speculate
like I don't know if they're holding
their feet for new products and they
want to make sure that it's really well
integrated in the ecosystem as opposed
to just the three products that
currently support it could be in the
future we still haven't seen a Macbook
revision we're late for that now that
was expected at the event that just
happened that wasn't there so it could
be we're gonna see this on proprietary
wireless charging tech integrated into a
wider variety of devices and they're
they're holding this back specifically
so that it hits everything at once I I
don't know on the subject of losing
ports though our managing editor David
Roddick actually wrote a very very long
very interesting op-ed on that subject
just this morning that I would highly
recommend you give a read I love David's
writing by the way so yes definitely go
to read yeah definitely it's you know we
love what you guys do at Android police
because well I hate to make you talk
about you know Happel stuff but again
like you guys today
yeah totally like you guys do pretty
good on the cross-platform and kind of
opinionated writing because you know
David Rykken Reddick has lived with iOS
for a month yeah did not touch Android
during that time to my knowledge very
interesting stuff again
well I'll update this as we push live on
the audio post for this podcast episode
in the meantime I do want to get your
first initial take Ryan on because we
haven't heard from you on this podcast
about the key to just like a quick few
thoughts about of it I think the price
is a joke it's got a snapdragon 616 and
they want how much money for its $600 no
no no it's not even it's 1080p
equivalent it's a weird ass
the DPI is what like something 320 340 I
do not really feel the keyboard I mean
if I was into the keyboard or if not if
not that's that's that's a matter of
personal preference I'm not
but looking just purely at the rest of
the specs I don't think that the
keyboards weren't that premium you can
pick up at 1 +6 with way better specs
for less money well I'm gonna give Jaime
exactly 5 minutes to talk about his past
several days holding the key to in hand
and just going with it and I'm gonna
stop you : at 5 minutes oh that's good
ok so I've been using the key to for a
bit I actually was able to see the
product very early and you know I I
guess I when I was shown the key one
originally I wanted that phone to be
everything that it promised to be buried
mine I come from the days of the
blackberry pearl the blackberry curve I
actually used these products not as a
fan enthusiast but because I needed them
for work I used I worked in ups airlines
and this was the way we would
communicate and so there were a couple
of key elements that were important to
blackberries they weren't necessarily
the most powerful you but this is not
the reason why you bought a blackberry
you bought a blackberry because there's
software back in the day was incredibly
snappy it was power it was very
practical and designed to be a
communicator it wasn't designed to be a
multimedia phone it wasn't designed for
anything but to help you communicate and
so you need a couple of important things
to achieve you know or a communicator to
be a communicator but for example for me
the concept of it doesn't have a
snapdragon 845 or whatever you know I
didn't understand it when they launched
the previous one and then I started
using it for the review period and I
guess I entered the review period being
like it's got like really and then
obviously when I started using it and I
got like two days of battery life after
like an intensive hall of email and just
the typical things that we do because
think about it like we literally most of
us work from home or work from a remote
office most of us are not in the same
spot so
the concept of chatting the concept of
voice communication and the concept of
responding to emails is pretty much work
for us that's really what our work
entails and so it is horribly
frustrating to have this amazing power
on a galaxy s 9 + or many phones out
there and as a result have terrible
battery life be be it at 5:00 p.m. and
you already need a charger and so for me
it was one of those things where it was
like shoot if I could have a phone that
could be really cuz I always carry two
phones and by the way I've been carrying
two phones ever since I started using a
blackberry because I thought that the
BlackBerry Perls keyboard which is too
cramped and so I was like alright I'll
have this one
and then my Windows Phone is gonna be
like my primary for content consumption
in gaming and so I that was like heaven
that was perfect for me because one of
these phones was like perfect I knew
that I could trust it to be like my
workhorse and then I could trust the
other one for whenever I wanted to watch
a video and the key to sorry the key one
was that
but the keyboard was too much he just I
feel that the software just wasn't ready
for what they wanted to do and my
experience with the key to is a lot of
that has been solved I feel that you
need a good three generations for a
product to - I mean we've seen it like
the oneplus one wasn't the best of
one-plus - wasn't the best but then the
oneplus 3 was like oh my god this is
really cool same thing the Galaxy S one
in the two were not the best phones but
then the three was like great same thing
with the iPhones like the 3GS was like
this is such a great phone it's the same
thing I mean the key to is not fair in a
couple of things obviously our review
will go live soon and we'll go into
detail over what those things are but I
feel that would I pay six hundred and
fifty dollars I feel that the price tag
is too high I feel that the price tag of
the key one at five fifty was still
steep the blackberries were never really
expensive phones if you remember like if
you bought a bold 9900 back then it was
like four hundred fifty four hundred and
eighty dollars except the making this
jump into five into six fifty for me the
only problem for me the problem of this
phone is mainly that the price
everything else like I feel that
blackberry has that so third-party apps
do a better job in adapting to this form
factor than to adapting to the knotch
on devices like the p20 pro for example
I feel like like Instagram and other
apps like those apps adapts perfectly
for this phone but they don't for knotch
displays in most cases on Android so I
don't know man like for me I have no
complaints about Android we've got the
RAM that we didn't have on the q1 so a
lot of the things that I didn't like
about the q1 like how clunky the camera
was or how sent luggage should be came
thank you those things are solved here
and oh my god like I love the keyboard
just because it feels like a bold 9900
like it's so sweet to type and there's
less travel and I love that it corrects
when you type not like in the past yeah
so I'm gonna cut you off there overall
they did a whole bunch of research on
the bold 9900 and what you should feel
like so they definitely tune in for that
I find it interesting to see that there
is still that gap between the offering
and perceived what should be the price
points for this device because you see
it in the raw specs right and then also
I mean I big case of it but it's like
but it's still that not that price
especially I'm I guess history has a lot
to do with that because of that
historically low price but I don't know
do you think yeah well I'm gonna go back
to Ryan on this do you think that is it
2018 standards that this is pretty much
the least that they can demand without
looking like it's cheap or what do you
think it is um you know honestly I don't
know what justifies the price it could
be the hardware keyword but that doesn't
really make sense to me it's definitely
not the specs um I don't think it's the
software either because if it's anything
like last year's key one it's not gonna
get a whole lot of updates which is kind
of weird for something you is this being
sold to people who are mindful of
security business people after the way
they handled updates on the key one
I really wouldn't pick up one of these
assuming it's gonna be this you know
high-security device it's quite the
opposite based on previous model so I
don't I really don't know where
the price is coming from your guess is
as good as mine but I'm gonna stop you
right there I mean we've got devices
like the Galaxy S 9 Plus which just got
like they boast about not so much and
yet that phone has received zero
security updates has it not it hasn't
like zero like it's it's the worse like
the state of Android and updates in
general is just really bad really really
I mean only people that are doing even
like Android one participation is upset
at me and I'm grateful for that but also
just Nokia in general because they've
whether or not they've been on Android
when they made the promise of fast quick
updates and you know they've delivered
even with meticulous inspection on that
and this but yeah it's not not the same
story right Ryan definitely has a point
I mean seriously if you're gonna tell me
that this is a secure phone and you're
not gonna do your job when it comes to
security updates that is a big deal
definitely I I guess I didn't use the
key one enough there are things about
this phone that are really cool I am
shocked at how much applications will
use your camera or your microphone
without you knowing just because you
gave it a permission and because you can
set the D Tech application to tell you
that the camera is being used for me
every time I get a notification that's
an option on the notification by the way
oh my god I've been like so conscience
of what phones do now and this is the
only phone that provides that by the way
actually be providing it with Android P
win the great piece starting in and
repeat I mean like you know BlackBerry's
taking the first step so I guess you
could give it a little kudos for that
let's just I mean the focus on you know
foreground background operations you
know and everything that I'll stop the D
technique covers is you know that those
are a little like bonus point for case
use studies you know into the microphone
into the camera and whatnot and they're
just a whole bunch of like little other
things that you know they hope they
combine into this one package that is
worth your value your time your money so
I mean there's a lot to look forward to
and
that Android police doing some coverage

up his video review and hopefully the
bargains come down real soon

that you tune in for those I want to

and we are back with more of a program
here on the body non weekly and the just
a couple of more interesting little
tidbits here in terms of social media
well originally I scheduled this block
to go first but I guess we'll just start
off with Instagram because they've made
news this week that they're trying to
make vertical long-form content more of
a thing I have kind of my I think we're
taking it too much at face value we're
kind of being disingenuous with it but I
mean you've had hands-on with IG TV
Jaime Rivera you've actually posted one
bit of content so I want to let you
explain it from someone that has
actually used it so we're actually we
were we actually I actually teased that
we're that I was going to be in the
podcast on IG TV before we went live so
everybody that joins thank you so much I
oh my god so I we've gotten some really
strong response on IG TV a lot higher
than I expected
we so we're still trying to figure out
what exactly to cover so IG TV is
literally Instagram you know it's the
ground has been copying a ton of things
from other platforms and I guess it's
been doing it
very well like it's the gram stories are
playing copy of snapchat but they've
done a really good job at it
they provide the discovery that snapchat
doesn't provide we've got a lot we've
got a lot of benefits on IG TV the
perfect I guess the problem is they want
it to be vertical video and they want it
to be vertical video you know it's funny
because even Instagram stories now
supports horizontal you can fit a
horizontal video into a vertical screen
you get the pillarboxing and everything
but but at least it works but no they
want it to be vertical and so you've got
we've got so many products where we're
like oh my god how are we gonna make
this vertical if we didn't even bring
this to be vertical we framed it to be
horizontal you know camera sensors are
designed to be four by three and you
know the whole thing about and I still
have this debate where it's like yes we
use our phones vertically but I see
people on the subway all day just using
their phones horizontally as well just
watching video so it's not like if it's
an unnatural thing to flip your phone a
lot of the comments that I saw yesterday
on our Instagram TV pose were like you
know this is kind of weird because we
flip our phones all the time there's
nothing wrong with that and so we'll see
I feel that regardless I feel that it's
awesome that Instagram is coming up with
something unique I feel that YouTube
does deserve some competition I'm
actually kind of worried that other
platforms have died out and then others
are focusing on other things and then
just YouTube is being left alone and so
I love that we have something new but we
are definitely gonna approach ittv
differently we're gonna provide
different content on IG TV because again
of the whole form factor thing but yeah
I like that it's easy it's very
practical to create content for it
everybody can create content and the
earlier you get on it the better so yeah
that's been a perfect it's what this
graphic definitely one of those
ground-floor things that we
to get into I mean especially as media
companies I want to wonder if you have
any well first of all personal stake and
also if Android Police has been sort of
trying to work out what it might be able
to you because you you're also kind of
burgeoning in terms of the YouTube
aspect as well well to be honest I'm not
really qualified to speak on the subject
of Instagram because I'm a terrible
millennial I can count the number of
times I've used it on one hand and I
have no interest in it whatsoever
um so I don't personally use it or have
too much experience with it I know that
we've we've probably we've been looking
into other means for pushing video
content and I assume that the people who
do that are are looking at that but I I
really don't know the first thing I have
no interest in Instagram i underst I got
met quite a few friends that are just
trying to figure what the heck is doing
so but I pushing it to YouTube because
I'm kind of we were actually just
talking about this on our podcast last
night like we're I'm really tired of the
way YouTube Andals doing everything it
does because they do a terrible job of
it and Google does just stop like yeah
it's just stop giving them as much
freedom it's just one hole it's like one
short-sighted move after another and I
feel like as we go into the growing
pains about GTD it's gonna be like that
but I just want to fill out just a few
more details on this so talking about
any content or get vertical but it it
lasted as long as 15 seconds up to an
hour now that our let me interrupt you
there it tells you just one minutes it
at least initially your limit is 10
minutes so maybe yeah for more like
official public you know contact RIA
news like now or automatically for that
but 10 minutes is still quite a long
time I feel like we're gonna see that
bell curve kind of more arranged towards
the three four minute mark just to be
fair and yeah this it's gonna be
interesting to see what happens
especially as YouTube feels with the
pressure because they have announced
just today monetization measures more of
those
it's such as you know paid access to
certain videos turn turns so it'll be
interested again to see if we can get
all get a bump in this I want to just
hit on Oppo find X I'm not sure how much
we want to talk about this because I
don't know it feels kind of passe at
this point that's Wednesday what are you
talking about fastings movement what are
you talking about probably the coolest
products I've seen in a while
oh it was cool days ago but now it's old
hat just tell me what is cooler than
that phone right now
give me one pretty cool it's pretty cool
it is pretty cool I mean for everybody
yes I know servo head freakin camera
it's like moving Art's are awesome it
doesn't matter if they're useful I don't
care all right well you spend time can
you know I'm happy it has the AMOLED
display because that's pretty much the
best that you can get around 99 euros
and that's totally fine for this kind of
thing I get it I get it
you don't like experiment I think it's
cool Jules
let me let me stop you right there more
happy about it
the United States for the first time I
think yes can I please talk now thank
you
notches now you're gonna complain about
a solution for them I haven't complained
about notches come on dude we all have
personal thing is that I'm fine dodging
it that's the thing I mean smartphones
need to evolve we've we've come into
this complacency where
one company does one thing and everybody
follows and then here we have a company
that comes up with a completely
different approach of how to build a
product whether it's a good idea or not
do that I mean there's only one way to
find out we've got series called reviews
we've got comparisons we've got after
the buzz videos where we get to test
products over time and see how they
perform we will see if this idea works
or not is it worth 1000 euro oh my god
I'd ask you the same question about the
iPhone 10 I don't know if I could tell
you that I think it's totally worth 1000
here for what it is it's just for the
spec but Oppo has always been like that
I mean they come up with these like and
for me I'm actually glad that oboes back
we had the N series from Oppo and then
they stopped doing it completely
we had the fine series from Oppo then
they stopped doing completely and they
stopped and they started pulling a ton
of iPhone clothes and sure they realize
they're Britain but that was like money
that they could make in you know send
them to be like the second best in a
second most of shipping in China I mean
I totally get their strategy that's what
works in China and you know it's as
sustenance than this I feel like they
aren't going in this at the right time
because you know what Xiaomi has been
making a big mass about their global
expansion and how they want to get all
the money to them and oh the Chinese
government is like planning because they
don't have Chinese money he's doing
whatever but also is just taking its own
initiative and I should be happy for
them because like we're gonna see
something new for the first time it's
great
i I and for me it's just I just made me
it's just that server thing I don't know
what what's going on with me and like
moving parts but I don't know if you saw
this move on it's worth the experience
but the point wasn't defined in five I
think there's the fine fire that was
like introducing it to us because it had
one camera but he was on this heaviness
and it just flipped around said that
like that was amazing and this you know
with the like 3d facial recognition
and you know and like great cameras like
those things in themselves are amazing
of it does it really have to be like
doesn't have to pop up every single time
of the group yeah like why can't I just
like pop it up myself and have that
option at least because that's not it's
not an option it automatically detects
it you know when you're doing the facial
recognition thing or you're opening the
hair no I want to you know the physical
redundancy in case an fails I don't know
I think I don't know where you start
praising the camera too much keep in
mind that camera performance isn't much
about software's it is about hardware
and there is no indication whatsoever
that hope knows what they're doing when
it comes to that it's interesting to see
I've been using a ton of opal phones in
the past they weren't necessarily the
best cameras but they you know we have
to understand that they focus a lot on
the Chinese market the Chinese market as
a very interesting reference when
compared to us the Chinese market cares
a lot more about selfies in general and
they have catered their selfie
technology very well like they have
really big give me a second they were
they were one of the first companies to
actually boost the amount of megapixels
on the selfie camera notice I mean I
think we you've been having like 20
megapixel sensors from them for a bit
their whole beautifying those things
like that like they've been investing
hard on that and my experience with the
primary shooters is of course they're
not great low-light performers but don't
do a decent job so with a thousand
thousand euro job the how that's a good
question so this is one of those things
where it's like we have to remember that
the fine series has been their flagship
series for years before they killed it
out so honestly I'm gonna give them the
benefit of the doubt
I'm waiting for my review unit and I
will assess it you know I saw her
reviews already went live which I find
as as I know that the timeframe for
shipping was kind of constrained so okay
fine there are reviews already not going
to criticize anybody but this is one of
the things you need to test and
particularly I understand your concern
Jules particularly with that mechanism
is it able to deliver all the time
that's gonna be a very interesting
question can it do it or not because you
know vivo will give you that selfie
camera popping up every now then but
only when you eat it
whereas this phone has to do it every
single time so it's gonna be interesting
to see if it can deliver or not
yeah it's it is um I just want to also
just mention the one other thing that
really pissed me off about this was the
fact that they labeled their freakin
facial recognition like sweets oh and oh
face this is their official push into
European and North American markets I
mean I'll just leave it there oh oh
thanks you have the title for your
review now oppa find X : this is my o
face emoji because of course 2018 is
gonna be the year of crazy branding
starting with the LG Thank You brand oh
god where did you guys get that
marketing team because I have yet to
meet one consumer that likes to say the
thread the word thank you it's because
all the good employees and left the
sinking ship man this is gonna be the
last year of LG man no it's not it's not
it's not sinking its thank you
yeah no they'll probably stick around
from the longer but I really I don't
think they're long for this world them
an HTC both I mean well I mean LG is
means I thought about LG I mean LG both
companies I mean both yeah consumer
choice is good yeah
and then come on these these companies
made some really great phones like there
was a time where LG was LG HTC was HTC
and now everything is everything Samsung
everybody else is making stuff at loss I
think they're still around because they
have that reason they have you know
their table so they have a whole bunch
of pool that they play in and they might
as well have the smartphone division
there that's their excuse because they
want to play around but the technology
and do it anyways because you don't have
to make money in that division
they got others like laundry machines
and whatnot that that make enough money
for them it's just you know I don't know
how to feel about that if you're not
really gonna take it seriously than
going take it at all
don't take the approach don't take this
really approach just no more splat on
the wall no more one we're talking but
one more talk talk talking topic thing
I'm trying to find words here but I just
wanted to mention that finally the New
South Wales government again is a
connecting us a study to see how
kindergarten to year 12 students use
their smartphones in schools and based
on whatever they find they might suggest
new policies that will either ban the
use of smartphones in school or limit
them perhaps even just limited to dumb
phones just carry those ruling should
yeah yeah so I will we'll have to see
about that because the study is only
just starting I just want to you know
start off with you know wondering Oh
what your involvement with phones was
back maybe middle school high school I
mean I am gleny also Jules I'm not that
yeah Ryan please by all means before I
mean in college I got a know I think
senior year of high school I got a
blackberry pearl and I didn't pull it
out in class or anything like that but I
had one I used it I think I actually
would have gotten in trouble if I had
used it in class but yeah I I can't say
I disagree with the idea of going
without smartphones in schools
like they've got other things to focus
on there's no there's no real reason to
have one a laptops one thing you knew
what we're gonna laptop maybe a tablet
if you believe Apple but I I really feel
good well yeah well here's the thing
here that can provide as the 23 year old
in this group I first saw the first
smartphone cellphone just plain old sofa
back when I was in third grade Oh Mike
silver and years old and lucky yeah I
wish I mean that kid was lucky in but it
was quite amazing to me how quickly it
spread because it wasn't you know it was
like over the next couple of years it
was probably like maybe thirty forty
percent of our students
my classmates just getting that phone in
and you know eventually that turned into
blackberry eventually that turned into
you just iPhone or Android mostly on
iPhone because you know that's the case
that happens to be with teens but as the
father of three kids I'll tell you this
much I there's a there's a phenomenon
happening and we're noticing it with
Android P and we're noticing it with iOS
12 where companies are becoming
conscience of the fact that we can't
consider the fact that things like your
if you remember when I was when when the
App Store was originally launched many
years ago for the iPhone they were like
this is gonna be an amazing gold rush
for developers and we've you know these
companies have allowed developers this
insane amount of Liberty and creating
content that is really good at keeping
people locked into their phones and this
is the way they make money the problem
is we're really hurting society we're
really hurting society because like it's
it's very for me it's very funny to get
on a New York City Subway and notice
that people are all on their phones like
it doesn't really matter what age group
you're in and everybody is on their
phones and it just makes it makes
society a lot less friendly to a certain
degree and so I find that if you're an
adult you have more of you I guess you
have a Maura
- palate in that phase of your life for
you to make the conscious decision if
you want to be stuck using your phone or
not but as a kid you know kids don't
have enough judgement to define if
they've spent too much time on their
phone or not they just don't and these
apps are really cool they're designed to
lock them in so I as a father of three
would be extremely happy if we could go
back to cuz it's funny how a lot of
parents these days like I used to go to
pee sometimes go to parent-teacher
conferences and they're like they're
like yes but what happens if I have an
emergency and I need to talk to my kid
and I'm like how do we do that thirty
years ago like 20 years ago there was
one phone in the school and if there was
an emergency you call the damn school
pull the kid from school and you make
him talk or a dumb phone is also a good
solution yeah so to be fully honest with
you oh my god I would love that to be a
general rule and I would I would even
love it for society's to have like some
sort of a restriction where like we as
parents are forced like for example the
fact that you know children can't buy
alcohol or or they can't buy cigarettes
until they can show an ID I would love
for there to be like a forced parent
parental control for how much kids are
using digital devices in their spare
time I get it when they need them for
work but I mean like seriously
yes but I'm talking to my friend like
God and play ball man like you know go
out there it's rap with other kids you
know that's my perspective I feel that
it's it's a step in the right direction
and I like that it's only one country so
it allows you to test the ground and see
how the reaction of society is going to
be yeah I want to get to Ryan's point
here if he has one on this particular
issue because I am trying to I'm gonna
mount a rigorous defense against this
here so I don't see how you could I
gotta say I agree like when I was when I
was in school when I was a kid and we
did have dumb phones at the time you
were forbidden from using those during
class like that was already a rule you
can't you can't can't have it you could
have it on your person if you wanted to
but it had to be set to silent and
functionally you may as well not have
had one you weren't looking at it you
were getting notifications on
wasn't having an effect on you and I I
think I just think it disrupts the
learning process they're there to learn
they're not there to talk to their
friends they're not there to look things
up online they need to be paying
attention to things teachers are saying
I don't think that I don't think there's
any real reason for students to need a
phone during class all right well I
guess I have to be the one that actually
has to just make sure that we get the
other side here so you're lucky we're
not in the same room Jules I would go
ahead go ahead
all right but here here the phone
represents a medium of communication a
medium of wait just the mobile phone is
the medium of communication that no that
is just represents freedom for kids to
be able to actually talk and also just
not just when you're meeting up with one
person or a medium for the net person
but just be able to let people know that
you're this you're that
you're happy to your side and that
you're free to express and you know in
some cases without having the you know
parents know about what exactly you're
doing because sometimes you have things
that you keep from your parents because
you're not exactly sure if they're
afraid or if you should be afraid of
them reacting to whatever you're doing
the end where you know personal personal
a diet personal identities excuse me I'm
talking here
personal identities and you know or
whatnot yeah so and there is a valid use
for them in school because during class
during class because I was able to text
my answers to certain questions you know
they learned implementing digital
lessons with a thing with a projection
boards and a little in class social
slides
yeah but but again some schools a lot of
schools actually don't have budgets or
can't really a you know afford to keep
and maintain a whole fleet of iPads or
or you know they have I t's to deal with
with support that infrastructure costs a
ton of money and well it may be the
future I mean a lot of them will stick
to using
computers that are well tried and
through and that are older and you know
this is something that they don't they
have less to deal with with personal
cell phones they have less to deal wit
with in terms of just getting kids to
use their own phones and you know a
sense of privacy a sense of being able
to like be secure and you like typing
whatever they want and also just being
able to educate effectively and you know
quickly I'm sorry that's not dude it's a
bit of a stretch it's a bit of a stretch
it's a you're entitled to your opinion
buddy you're entitled to your buddy
I've made a ton of friends on the
internet on mobile internet that I don't
think I would have because you know I
identify one way or another and I'm
afraid about what my parents think about
you know certainly but do you need to be
talking with those people during the
middle class I mean if shits going down
in the middle of class then yes but
you'd probably just about communication
about about education it is about
education of social interactivity and
how people treat each other in southern
services holy snapchat Instagram
Facebook those things exacerbate and I
mean we've talked about in this piece
here so now you used your phone during
class when you were in high school is
what you're telling me oh yeah like
while you were studying you were
supposed to be paying attention to what
the teacher was saying you were instead
ignoring that to do your own thing do
you want to encourage you are you
chatting with somebody else right now as
we're doing this podcast or do you need
to be doing you don't understand where
I'm coming from here I love I grew up
with like a very conventional very you
know straightforward thing but like
we're in evolving society here and
insidious is when the immediacy is
important when you're trying to you know
deal with services like you know how to
de-escalate a very hostile situation but
you know about Becky just broke up with
her boy
friend during math well not even well I
mean when especially in some cases when
people can't handle their management
their their manage their anger properly
then you know the you find that there
are tech services nowadays that rely on
certain kinds of data policies but it's
like you know it's there's a person
right next to you or there's the person
that you're able to access immediately
that's like hey let's talk things down
that's you know go do like okay so when
you're just like everyone's supposed to
be doing something else I suggest that
you listen I'll suggest that you listen
to marketplaces make me smart podcasts
because there is an episode that does
mention this and yeah that talks about
the service so using a phone during
school well you're supposed to being
paying attention to the lessons yeah no
no seriously if because sometimes it's
the lessons that you know these
happenings that these events occur so I
mean trying to really I don't know about
you I don't know what I've seen I have
gone through you know I've seen stuff in
my life that really hasn't been you know
trust me I come from I come from a
generation and I come from a society
where being on doing something else
while you're supposed to be paying
attention is called disrespect yeah
that's just the way it is you know and
one of the major things it's just the
basic principle in life the principles
are internal it doesn't really matter
what generation you're on it doesn't
really matter what you do
principles are basic like respecting
other people like giving people that's
just the way it is don't do to others
what you wouldn't like to be done to you
you wouldn't like for you to be talking
to a person and that person having a
chat conversation with somebody else on
the phone it's this is just basic human
interaction basic human behavior where I
understand it's not that I don't
understand your point Jules it's just I
feel that there I've had so many bad
experiences interviewing people for jobs
in the previous job that I had because
particularly of how introverted most of
our society has become because people
are stuck on their phones
they don't have that ability to
socialize with other people they like I
totally get the like I come from the
generation where tanning is quality and
I made a ton of friends and I did it a
lot of girls that way you know though
but but we you know eventually we
learned that those kinds of
communications aren't really
communications like it's not the same
for you to learn to actually address a
person directly in a meaning and so it's
it's not the same for you to learn those
social skills like this phone is not
going to teach you that this phone is
designed through yes how do you
communicate that's the principle but
there are a lot of applications in this
phone that weren't designed to help you
communicate they're designed to help you
consume what they sell in many other
ways and the biggest problem is I mean
that's totally it's not so talking about
you know what the ants the the meaning
of cynical is I told you and I said the
meaning of cynical is that I am Telling
You have to subprime okay so it's like I
knew that the word this doesn't apply
right here I am Telling You that this
product is designed to sell me something
in most cases like if I don't download
for tonight is that how can you
guarantee that a kid is not going to be
playing for tonight while the class is
going on exact actually doing the things
that you're saying right now you can't
enforce there could be using the phone
feed that is cynical that is cynical
free to use for you to say that you have
something and that you're using it for
one purpose but then you're doing
something else entirely and that's the
reason why I'm telling you children
cannot they don't understand children
don't have enough judgment they don't
have the maturity to learn that it's bad
to be playing candy crush while the
teacher is trying to tell them teach
them something believe notification
isn't something you get at that age you
know that my friend is being cynical mmm
I don't think I don't think you trust
they're not children officially if you
really give it all of your old an iPad
and tell them not to look at it while
you're doing something else and it's not
gonna happen you're gonna give me a
lecture over the concept of raising kids
that's kind of a hard one buddy but you
know what I listen this that's the
beauty of this podcast
it's about opinion man this is yours and
you're giving it as a millennial and
that's awesome man I'm just telling you
the things that I deal with as a parent
we're for you obviously it's convenient
because
it's your rights the ones that you're
defending but then as a parent I'm the
one that has to teach them how to live
and I will tell you this much the best
way to teach them how to live is to
teach them how to survive in the world
not how to survive on their phones
teachers have not done a good job of
that where else did you turn to I'll
just say I'll just say that because
again there are millions of children
that feel the same right now so and
that's what you have these you know
memes and tumblr and whatnot I mean if
you're into the sociology of it you
don't have class man it's enough time
for it go at home lunch break whatever
but not while you're supposed to be
paying attention to what's on what's in
front when people were saying if we were
in a meeting like if we were in a
meeting right now and when somebody
would pull out a phone and and I noticed
that they're playing candy crush what
well I'm the boss and I'm telling them
what to do and they're not paying
attention to me they're fire yeah see
here's the thing that's what school is
for we teach schools or to teach
children how to survive in the world
