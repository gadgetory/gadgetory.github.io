it's also a pain in the butt so if
you're sick of swiping patterns and
selecting security codes and you're into
temporary body modification
Viva Link and Motorola have just the
thing for you I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is how to unlock your
Moto X with a tattoo of course the
beaver linked tattoos are the temporary
sort and that's a good thing they're
stylish shipping envelope is covered in
the kinds of medical warnings you
usually see on aspirin bottles letting
you know that if you have sensitivities
to nickel chromium or Tegaderm you need
to stay away from them the digital
tattoos come in packs of 10 and
installing one is as simple as plucking
it from its protective sheet and
sticking it wherever it's most
convenient the 3m glue sets pretty
quickly if your skin is clean apply
pressure for 20 seconds and it's on
there good it doesn't come off in the
shower and it doesn't matter how many
shirts you put on or take off though it
does get pretty dirty over time just
like you'd expect from a sticker you
slap on your skin and it really sticks
on there even after five days removing
ours was a task then it left some
accrued dirt we needed to wash off once
it's applied pairing the digital tattoo
to the Moto X is as simple as tapping
the phone to the target and following
the on-screen instructions it's just an
NFC tag so setup takes less than a
minute and you do need to select a PIN
code as a backup if for some reason you
become separated from your tattoo
hopefully not due to dismemberment by
the way there's no law saying you have
to wear the things you can put them
anywhere you want as long as you've
paired phone and tattoo first we found
unlocking is simple and reliable even
through fabric is it really more
convenient than a passcode we're not
sure it's a simpler action to unlock yes
but it is a little awkward it's also
important to remember to destroy or
unpair old tattoos if you're really
security conscious because a phone thief
dumpster diver could easily ruin your
whole day and the look of course is not
for everyone but for Moto X owners it is
a cool way to sidestep that cumbersome
passcode process and for everyone else
it's a nice reminder that the term
wearable is not confined to smartwatches
if you're a Moto X owner get your own
digital tattoo at the link in the
description below and check out our
additional moto X and wearable
technology coverage here at pocket now
till next time this has been michael
fisher with pocket now captain to phones
on twitter thanks for watching and we'll
see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
