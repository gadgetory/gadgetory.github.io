today I'd like to show you another soft
keyboard this time it's called thumb
keyboard and it just came out of beta
and it's really got something cool
tucked up its sleeve let's go take a
look okay so I've opened up a new
document in Google Docs and you can see
down here I've got my soft input panel
or my input method editor or my soft
keyboard whatever term you want to use
hey that's fine with me if you look at
this it looks pretty much like every
other soft keyboard it does have these
little directional arrows on the bottom
that's so if you don't have a trackpad
or a roll ball like a lot of the earlier
Android devices do but a lot of the
newer ones don't well you can still
position your cursor around using those
kind of nice it's a good thing to have I
like to be able to turn them off and I
haven't figured out how to do that yet
cuz I don't need am I going to trackpad
but it looks just like anything right so
we can come in here and type and I
learned the little trick guys I'm going
to turn my phone so I can type a little
more accurately so I'm gonna do the
traditional a little world okay so just
like that and of course I had to spell
it wrong so we're gonna use those arrows
and come back and change it to hello
world now of course we can do the same
thing over here on a new line will say
h-e-l-l-o and I've got a big fat finger
so I'm getting the eye instead and we do
have autocomplete just like others so
we'll go ahead and complete that so all
in all pretty cool right
it's just a keyboard nothing new nothing
novel until you do this
so let's tip it on edge and once we do
that and come back in here check that
out so what we've got now is a split
keyboard that we can type in a lot
faster with our thumbs because it's all
right there split
separated kind of like an ergonomic
keyboard for our thumbs while we're
typing so we can get in here and type in
and I practice this I promise but it's a
little bit more difficult on camera
because the phone's it a little bit of
an angle so hello world how are you
wrong press to get the alternate key
very neat so that's about it or is it so
let's go in here and let's come back
turn that off long press in our text box
and select the input method now you can
see I've got two input methods available
here and I'm gonna turn this back into
portrait I've got some keyboard and I've
got Android keyboard so in thumb
keyboard let's go into some settings and
you can see what really makes this stand
out to get there long press on your
speech button it's got that little
Settings icon up there so we'll go ahead
and tap and hold on that I think I got
it let's try that again so now let's go
into select layout now notice all these
layouts that we've got first of all
we've got phone standard that's what you
saw in this traditional portrait display
we then also have phone split large
phone split compact so what that means
is instead of having a finger keyboard
which is how I like to use it in
portrait mode versus a thumb keyboard
which is how I like to use it in
landscape mode this phone split will
actually split the two halves of the
keyboard up and down make the keys
bigger so that then you can thumb like
that so let's go ahead and take a look
at that at the the large version okay so
now we need to come back out of that and
we'll go back in you know I need to
switch things around a little bit so let
me do that and I'll be right back
alright so here's a little bit better
look at how we've got that split
keyboard we've got numbers we've got
symbols we've even got those direction
keys and we've got the letter split out
so you can thumb down here and thumb up
here and your keys are a little bit
bigger not significantly bigger but big
enough to make a difference now this
brings me to my first issue with with
this keyboard with this app so let me go
ahead and show you we're going to go
back into settings and we're going to go
into general keyboard settings not
select layout and I'll show you why and
we're actually already in there so if we
come in here here's our settings and
we've got all kinds of cool stuff and
you know sound on our key press haptic
feedback which was turned off by default
that's the vibration you feel when you
press the buttons so I turned that off I
turn that on
that's just preference vibration
strength you can set to whatever you
want I left it the same theme you've got
all kinds of theming really kind of cool
there I'll show you a couple of those in
a little bit international keyboards so
we have QWERTY twice or excuse me QWERTY
and chords e azerty still no Dvorak I
don't know why people don't like Dvorak
and then keyboard dimensions now that's
kind of interesting and it gets us into
what makes is cool and that's this can
also be a tablet keyboard so you can
actually make the keyboard larger
smaller change the layout if you're a
tablet that's why we had phone and
tablet broken up but that's what I was
saying about what I don't particularly
like I think it's kind of buggy if you
go into keyboard layout or layout
keyboard rather you can define a custom
layout combination okay
or you can come in here to some
predefined stuff which doesn't want to
be answering me right now so we'll turn
that one back on so if we come into the
portrait layout this is the layout that
you see when it's in portrait mode just
like that so I've just changed this from
standard which you saw first to large
which I just showed you you've also got
this split compact layout and then
tablet layout one tablet layout to four
7-inch tablets and then the tablet ten
inch layout okay when you rotate it into
landscape you can have it set as a
different layout now there
some apps out there we've talked about
before that let you define what keyboard
you want to use in portrait versus
landscape and it swaps them out on the
fly which is really kind of slow because
every time you rotate your phone in
addition to changing the orientation and
moving all of the all the bitmaps all
the text all that other stuff around
now it's also got to unload your
existing soft keyboard and load in a new
one and so it takes a bit more time well
with this it's the same keyboard it's
already loaded in so I can define what I
want in portrait and what I want in
landscape it doesn't come like this by
default so you have to go in and set it
up so we can come in here and say hey I
want phone standard split yada yada yada
for my landscape layout as well so let's
go ahead and play with this a little bit
let's say we've got a 7 inch tablet okay
and then we'll test the layout well up
here you can see what we had to begin
with and when we rotate this now you can
see where that tablet keyboard is a
little bit more present so we've got the
buttons over here we've got the the
special characters arrow keys and
numbers right there split really kind of
nice so that's great but it's too small
for me to type well that's the point
this is for a tablet so this can be your
one keyboard that you used to on both
your phone and your tablet so really
kind of neat if you've got one of those
larger phones you know like an Evo or
whatnot you might be able to get away
with say a 5 inch tablet type display
for your keyboard here try it out see
what you like let's go into themes and
see what they've got there this comes
stock it with the honeycomb style let's
go ahead and try the iPad style and
before you guys say hey why why do you
and what do you want to do that that's
that's not all that cool you're an
Android guy well I know but flattery
it's the best form of that whatever so
there we go
it looks very I phone like it's got kind
of these nice squares the thing that I
like about this that I don't like about
the stock iPhone stuff is it
I've seen an iPhone or iPad and I could
be wrong with i io s for point whatever
you guys are up to now the keys are
always uppercase so when you start
typing they're always uppercase and I
don't know if I'm typing an uppercase or
lowercase until I've actually typed
something in this actually does the
Android method where what you see is
what you get so if you want something
uppercase no problem there's uppercase
but then it switches to lowercase makes
typing passwords a ton easier so there's
the iPad theme let's go ahead and look
at another one look at wood and the best
way to go in and test this is right
there so there's what it's got kind of a
wood grain in here kind of translucent
almost transparent keys with kind of a
nice museum type glow across the top
alright you done with that one quick
let's go back and see what we've got
next and we'll just kind of buzz through
these glass that sounds kind of
self-explanatory but we'll make sure it
is what we think it is so there it is
you've got some nice reflection lines
going through it a little bit more
three-dimensional looking keys
gingerbread
so very basic what you'd expect nuance
and a couple of these when we get down
to the bottom are really kind of cool
but I'll wait and show you there so this
is a little bit more basic a little bit
more flat with a blue kind of gradient
blue outline around the buttons kind of
nice there around the main buttons so
they stand out from the others honeycomb
city this is one of the ones that gets a
little bit cooler than the others so
right there it's got that honeycomb
wallpaper that looks kind of Tron Legacy
like in the background a little bit more
of that indigo type purple or midnight
purple in there so a little bit more
dimension looks a little more stylish
when you're on a honeycomb tablet or
even a not honeycomb tablet that you're
trying to make look like honeycomb that
can really help you out digital red so
just very basic very droid like with the
kind of hinted at keys that aren't
really there the the main keys have the
red underline underneath the other keys
have the gray over line goes up over the
top I don't know if that shows up very
well on camera but that's what we've got
there go back in and look at Galaxy Tab
very popular tablet in case you guys
aren't up on tablet news very simple
very clean I thought I hit a little more
button there black now that sounds
pretty self-explanatory and that it is a
little bit more 3d a little bit more
rounded look to the buttons then some of
the others that we've seen which have
looked relatively flat this is where it
gets kind of cool we've got a couple
more Windows Phone 7 look at that test
that layout so just very very flat let
me show you over here in this mode as
well so you
see they're just really flat simple
lines between the other keys and then of
course it's not a nice gradient
background very similar to to Windows
Phone 7 and what it looks like and last
but certainly not least dark and light
gray we'll test that out
and there you go now the keyboard like I
said is very intuitive it's very easy to
use it's nothing radically different
than what you've used before until you
start getting into this split keyboard
and especially when you start getting
into this back let me go back and show
you because it's been you know a little
while since I showed you that because we
had to show you all the themes let's go
back to the landscape layout and I want
to change this to the phone split large
layout let's go back in and test that so
when you come back in here and look at
it like this you can see how those keys
become very very easy to type easy to
use very friendly and honestly really
really fast it's it's something that
I've enjoyed using so let me tell you
how long I've been using this this I got
as a beta as I I don't remember if it
was a private or a public beta actually
I tell you the truth it goes public and
I've been using it off and on distance
with px for the last few weeks I really
have enjoyed using both of them but I
really seem to be going to this one just
because the keys are bigger I don't
necessarily need that fancy predictive
type like I get with the with the Swift
px app that we reviewed yesterday day
before so there's the Droid theme
applied to this but it's just it's just
faster for me to type now one of our
viewers a very astute viewer said ok do
you see the irony here here we are
reviewing these on-screen keyboards on
the t-mobile g2 which is the u.s.
variant of the HTC Desire Z which they
have in Europe and and so far so good in
all that's true and accurate he says why
are you doing that because
it's got one of the best hardware
keyboards available on the market today
and that it does I have to agree with
them one of the main reasons I got this
phone one of the main reasons I'm
sticking with this phone for as long as
I have been is because of this keyboard
it's very nice it's big enough for me to
use it's small enough to be compact the
keys are very responsive it's a great
keyboard I like it a lot you come in
here and say hello world and I get
exactly what I want hello world no
problems no futzin no anything like that
in fact the only times I've had any
problems with this is when I've been
using SwiftKey X and it's tried to
autocorrect something for me by
inserting extra words that I really
didn't want but that's not a fault of
the keyboard so he says you realize
that's kind of ironic that you're
showing us these soft keyboards on a
device that's specifically built to have
one of the best hard keyboards available
and yes I do realize the irony I didn't
when I was originally filming these but
the point behind it is sometimes you
don't want to flip out the keyboard and
you just want to hurry and tap something
out especially if you are in portrait
mode in fact I find I do the majority of
my typing in portrait mode versus
landscape mode which is what the
keyboard is unless I'm typing out a very
very long email or I'm trying to craft a
tweet that is like 150 characters long
but I'm trying to squeeze down into a
hundred and forty somehow I need that
extra level of precision that that
keyboard gives me other than that I mean
my most of my tweets are in this layout
most of my facebook stuff is in this
layout pretty much everything I do you
user names passwords is in this layout
just because I don't have to rotate it's
just faster for me to do it that way
so that's why I'm showing it to you also
once you start getting into stuff like
this
I grabbed my shade to pull it out once
you get this that's big enough I really
don't need a physical keyboard it's nice
to have but in all honesty I'm gonna try
using this for a while and I'm probably
going to stick with this theme because I
kind of dig it the keys are big enough
and
with the haptic feedback that vibration
when I push the keys there's enough
response that it's easy for me to know
what I've pushed when I've pushed it and
the accuracy has just been phenomenal
other than a few little glitches that
you've seen here shooting on camera
where I'm kind of looking at it and off
at an odd angle but when when it's right
in front of me it's been great so that's
why thank you for the comment it made me
laugh a lot of your comments make me
think this one actually made me laugh so
I appreciate that so to that viewer you
know who you are thank you for your
feedback we do invite feedback so please
leave messages down underneath the
YouTube video or over at pocketnow.com
in the comments section we love hearing
your opinions on them if you've got a
different theme that you like or a
different layout let us know why you
like it why you don't like it if you've
got suggestions or recommendations for
the developer usually the developers
will come out and they'll read our
articles and watch our videos on their
own product so it's a good way to get
some very vocal feedback to them we've
we've done that recently with the see if
I can remember the name that the sign
app I've actually been in a dialogue
with the developer ever since then
really nice guy but it's a good way for
us as users and enthusiasts to get a
more vocal feedback to to the developers
so really nice so if you like seeing
this kind of stuff
irony aside make sure you give the video
a big thumbs up of course subscribe to
our video channel if you haven't done so
already and head on over to
pocketnow.com the website because we do
have articles over there that we don't
cover in videos over here on the YouTube
channel so for pocketnow.com showing off
all kinds of cool soft keyboards this
one the thumb keyboard I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
