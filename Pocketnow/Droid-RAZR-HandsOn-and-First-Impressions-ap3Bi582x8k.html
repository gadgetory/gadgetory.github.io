is the side you mentioned seven
yes so I can tell you a few things about
this phone basically combines the power
Troy sign it weighs five t aspects the
phone will walk you through from the
design design perspective I mentioned
before ultra thin right and possibly
additionally we took took the time the
care to add into the design of most
serve these beveled corners here the
sculpted glass you can see on the edges
we've got the diamond-cut spun aluminum
accents on the front and on the sides
but even though this is a really thin
foam we made sure that this turned on
right now
yeah it's really good viewing angle you
can say it all the way over here it
looks like that's part of yeah it looks
like a post different are these super
amoled being super a very very wide
angle display yeah really good contrast
on them so I do mention some of the
things in terms of the how this phone is
strong inside stainless steel core
because that structural integrity two of
them then on the back here this is the
the Kevlar back you add the Templar back
to really give us the strength we needed
but at really minimal thickness
help achieve that within so that is that
metal calculus so Kevlar is a fiber yeah
can I know it's not a study it off
so those batteries effects their giving
or with the internal battery or is that
an external internal map is there way
for the external battery on this or that
so we have the P 89 893 that you can
connect to is okay so the Kevlar back is
such that that doesn't really come off
then route the battery the battery does
not come out okay so if I want to if I
want to get Excel power I have to buy
the next kernel battery pack all right
anything that one can be power or
suspect what we've done is we see your
right so get that p89 three power back
we've also got the Smart Actions app D
shows that yeah no plugin take that sure
you guys that so let's scroll over here
to smart actions so sort of runs in the
background and certain triggers turn on
to manages so there are a number of
examples here so we can put them few
samples there's different examples you
can do to charity reminder a morning
routine kept away below close those
before all these simple things right and
then do as you set the policy there are
some set policies there and some
templates are there you can use those
you get modified or so here I'm gonna
start from scratch it's basically set up
in terms of triggers and actions
triggers are what set off the actions so
that have all post of triggers which
could be your location could be our ear
headphones into miss the calls from a
certainty
person is calling all if you put
location is it always pulling the GPS to
see where you are now it's based off
Wi-Fi and then so you pick your
different triggers to be one could be
multiple you could have more than one
you could have more than one wife
situations in the office at work yeah at
all for example yeah and you get more
than one trigger so it could be only in
the morning when I'm at home do these
sort of things and these are certain
things you can do you can send a
notification you can change your ringer
volume you can turn on turn off GPS
cellular data we name it you've gotta
there's a very really smart application
that's one of our what version of
Android is is Charlie it's run 2.3.5 235
is it upgradeable die scripts and
announcements about Ice Cream Sandwich
the talk me about the dock so the dock
of the Atrix I presume won't work right
correct so we've had announced that dock
100 and the laptop which you can
actually see all those in the room right
over there demoing those what's nice
about those docks those are the docks
horrible all future wood rolling webtop
enable phones and they were already
hooked up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
