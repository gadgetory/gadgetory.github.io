thought impossible it popularized the
concept of the smartphone tablet hybrid
with the original Galaxy Note one year
later it built on that success by
consumer izing the concept with the
sleeker more powerful galaxy note 2 this
fall the company looks to up the ante
again with an even heavier feature set
made it to some of the biggest baddest
hardware available but in a world of
steadily ballooning smartphone
dimensions does the note 3 have what it
takes to stand out let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of the samsung
galaxy note 3
before we get started we'll remind you
as we did in our other Galaxy Note 3
videos that our review unit comes to us
by way of Negri electronics be sure to
visit them if you're looking for a note
3 of your own and be sure to follow
PocketNow on social media so you don't
miss future coverage on high-end
smartphones and tablets as we noted in
our video comparing the note 3 with its
immediate predecessor Samsung promised
that its latest phablet would come in
slimmer faster lighter longer and larger
than the note 2 and this being Samsung
those apparently contradictory terms
actually can coexist in the same device
since 60% of that adjectives dump deals
with physical dimensions let's start
this review by taking a look at the note
3's hardware after a flirtation with
wide radius corners and gentle curves
Samsung has returned it to a more
straightforward design aesthetic with
the note 3 recalling the days of the
original note and the Galaxy S 2 squared
off corners join with the usual foam
metal trim elements and a subtly
patterned surface to deliver a familiar
look on the front but turning the note 3
over reveals a welcome surprise
gone as the glossy tacky hyper glaze
coating of old replaced by a special
battery cover made to resemble leather
it's a bit rigid and slippery on our
white unit here but the black version
has a more rubbery texture that's easier
to hold on to in either case you get the
same custom stitching on the border the
same fine stripes on the sides meant to
represent the pages of a notebook
the motif may be a little on the nose
for some people but we like it it helps
set the note line apart from the galaxy
s devices making it stand out as
something entirely different which it
really is also playing a role in that
set off the massive 5.7 inch AMOLED
display which at 1080p resolution kicks
out a pixel density of 386 PPI for a
screen this big that's a pretty hefty
pixel count and it combines with
excellent color reproduction and
customizable saturation settings to make
this one of the finest panels around
it's squeezed so tightly into the note
3's casing that the housing itself
actually comes in smaller in nearly
every dimension than the note 2 and it's
lighter as well a remarkable achievement
to be sure but make no mistake it's
still a huge smartphone one-handed use
is possible but to make the most of the
phone you probably want to keep both
hands-free especially if you're using
the new and improved s-pen which we'll
come back to in a sec Samsung has always
used the note line as an opportunity to
bring the highest end specs possible and
the note 3 is no exception our unit the
SMN 900 packs the so-called Exynos
octa-core unwelcome Snapdragon 800 at
2.3 gigahertz either way these are
top-of-the-line systems backed up by
three gigs of RAM and either 32 or 64
gigs of storage powered by a battery
rated at 12 point 16 watt hours as usual
for Samsung that battery is removable
and user replaceable array as is the
optional micro SD card which can
accommodate up to 64 gigs of additional
storage array again rounding out the
class-leading feature set is support for
Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and AC USB 3.0 for faster
charging and data transfers an IR port
for controlling your home media system
and a sensor suite that includes
thermometer hygrometer and barometer
finally the Wacom digitizer returns on
the note 3 giving the display the
pressure sensitivity that makes the S
Pen work and Samsung's special stylus
works better than ever before here the
magic wand has gotten a slight aesthetic
overhaul and now fits into its silo
to orientations and also the nub at its
tip has been reworked to deliver a
softer firmer touch which feels nice and
the pen now triggers the capacitive back
and menu keys but the real story is in
software where Samsung has instituted a
new interface element called air command
the circular jump menu is
straightforward and clean and it packs
equal parts useful features and a little
bit of chrome applications like the
system-wide search and s finder and the
scrapbook crop collector are quite handy
other functions like action memo seemed
better suited to showroom stunts than
daily time saver and the pen window
action that lets you open apps and
custom sized windows is definitely cool
but it's less useful than Samsung's
other multitasking feature
fortunately multi window is still here
and it's been improved further you can
still run apps side by side on the big
screen and you can now copy and paste
text from one screen to another using
the more streamlined interface which
also now supports custom window presets
so if you always find yourself opening
Twitter and YouTube together you can now
set a shortcut to open them both which
is a big time-saver the rest of
Samsung's heavy UI layer is still here
and it's loaded with more features than
ever
whiz-bang stuff like air gesture smart
scroll and smart paws have been ported
from the galaxy s4 yes but more
interesting is the addition of Samsung's
Flipboard powered by magazine which
lives under the home screen it's
performance is quite slow it takes more
than a second to launch in several
seconds to update and out of the box it
appears every time you hit the home
button more than once which is pretty
annoying but it's essentially an
omnipresent Flipboard app and as such
it's a pretty cool addition elsewhere on
the note three more of the same Samsung
goes out of its way to bring some value
adds here and some are really cool we're
happy to see the fitness monitor
s-health make the cut and sketchbook for
galaxy is an incredibly powerful and fun
app for use with the S Pen other areas
like the me to Samsung hub content store
and the various over done memo apps
could use some refinement or retiring
in any case here the good overrides the
bad the software add-ons are enough to
cement the note threes position as the
most useful phablet out there testing
the Galaxy Note 3 over the course of 6
days in the Greater Boston area was a
near total pleasure in terms of overall
performance of course with the Exynos
octa-core and 900 had zero problems with
even the most strenuous of games modern
combat 4 and asphalt 8 ran without a
hitch
with graphics rendered so beautifully
that tearing ourselves away from the
action to write this review was honestly
tougher than usual benchmark results
were similarly outstanding and
day-to-day responsiveness barring the
occasional jump or stutter was usually
Swift and speedy but the phone did hang
on us twice during the test period
freezing on the home screen for no
apparent reason and requiring a forced
restart we haven't seen that behavior
mirrored on other devices in the
blogosphere but it was too ominous not
to mention we'll test other variants of
the note 3 as we get them and report on
the problem if it recurs a phone call
quality is solid on both ends on a TTS
3G network a big improvement over recent
Samsung phones with the earpiece
producing crisp sound and the volume
boost feature coming in handy for
speaker phone calls which are otherwise
too quiet
even with maxed out volume the note 3's
small speakerphone isn't as loud or as
bassy as we'd prefer for media it
fortunately sound through the earbuds is
considerably better and Samsung is built
in its special adapt sound feature here
to dynamically ultra levels based on the
ambient environment on the camera front
the 13 megapixel shooter bolted to the
phone's backside is a significant
upgrade to last year's model Samsung's
versatile viewfinder software makes
finding the right shooting mode very
easy most of the time and the result is
photos that are nothing short of
brilliant in the right lighting we
especially enjoyed the sports mode with
its faster shutter speed allowing for
fast motion capture and HDR and
animated photo are always a welcome
sight as well despite the narrow field
of view that forced us to back away from
our subject to catch photos we enjoyed
shooting with the note 3
in broad daylight and well-lit indoor
scenarios but were flabbergasted that
the company has opted to remove it's
nighttime shooting mode from the menu
replacing it with a confusing smart
stabilization option buried in the
settings menu if you don't have this
turned on be prepared for some really
low quality night shots once you throw
the switch though things get much better
video performance renders very sharp
footage in 1080p mode our and 900 unit
here doesn't feature the 4k recording
mode on other models and the software
stabilization is actually quite good
though indoor shots tend toward the
noisy side while it takes longer than
we'd like to launch the camera software
it's worth the wait
thanks to the various shooting modes and
the relatively easy to use interface
taken as a whole the note 3 shooter
isn't the best camera we've used on a
smartphone but it's also far from the
worst also far from the worst battery
life even with hardcore high-end gaming
and heavy browsing we were able to get
more than a day's use out of the note 3
and that's saying a lot for a phone with
a 1080p display this large altogether
the note 3 lives up to its legacy in a
big way
it improves on the note 2 in almost
every meaningful sense and it even
manages to stand apart from its fellow
Samsung devices functionally and
aesthetically something not easily done
in the company's watered down world
where nearly every smartphone bears the
galaxy moniker while we'd like to have
seen a stronger focus on quality over
quantity in the feature set and a
streamlining of the S Pen functionality
these are minor quibbles if you're
buying a large screened android device
you want utility to go along with the
added scale and right now the Galaxy
Note 3 is absolutely the most capable
most powerful smartphone tablet hybrid
on the market accordingly pocket now
scores it a 9 out of 10 pocket now's
