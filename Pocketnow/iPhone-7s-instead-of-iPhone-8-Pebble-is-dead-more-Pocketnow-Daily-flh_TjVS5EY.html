iPhone 7s says there might be no 10
years of iPhone the acquisition is final
Fitbit takes over pebble or at least
some part of that will and Google starts
making a few interesting changes to the
Google now feed I'm high metal Iveta and
let this t-shirt commemorate just how
close we are to Super Mario run this is
Parkin out daily the official loose
today begin with the fact that we are
very close to CES and we are already
packing getting ready for the event and
while you're at it set your calendars
for January 4th as a Seuss's just tease
as innovation to happen at CES and
probably the most interesting part of
this teaser is the fact that we hear
snapdragon 835 proble in the feed so
stay tuned we cannot wait to see what we
get another interesting news today have
to do with the Google now which is now
called Google feed but it used to be
Google now Google is making a couple of
changes that are now live on certain
devices on Android you should be getting
it on iOS as well very soon the whole
idea is that now you're gonna be getting
two tabs one of these is just going to
show you what's happening now and
another is going to show you what's up
next one up next for example if you've
got an appointment happening you have to
be there soon it'll tell you how soon
you have to leave and all this
functionality already existed in Google
now Google feed sorry the only
difference is it's now going to be
separate let's test it out now let's
move over to the hilarious news is Apple
has chimed in over the reasons why the
iPhone success is not powering on for
certain users that actually happened to
me and all I did was swap the phone that
was it but according to Apple because of
controlled ambient air in the rooms were
tested the iPhone 6s batteries
apparently wasn't able to determine if
this was going to be an issue and this
makes so little common sense that it's
even pointless to talk about this just
go swap your phone or swap your battery
it's completely free and speaking of
iPhone other very interesting and
ridiculous news have to do with the
possibility that there isn't an iPhone 8
happening next year since this year's
iPhone 7 apparently next year is going
to be iPhone 7s you know what the S
stands for
we're pretty much getting the same
product only with a new color option and
new specs and guts apparently we're
getting the a 11 ship we don't have
details over what that brings it
apparently we're getting a new product
red iPhone that is actually rather sad
than Apple if you're gonna pull that off
why not just also launch a jet to white
iPhone in the process and finally the
very disappointing news they have to do
with the death of pebble Fitbit is
acquiring the company partially so get
this hardware operations ceased today
warranty ceased a day if you ordered a
pebble apparently you're getting your
money back by March or your be getting a
full refund at some point if you're
still in the window where you can return
a product you can return it to the
retailer and that's actually a good idea
sure you can buy a pebble time steel
today and it cost like 130 bucks on
Amazon the problem is that product will
cease to receive support and we don't
know exactly when what we do know is the
fit that is using a pebble software in
the future and that's great because
fitbit's software wasn't really that
great at least on the mobile perspective
on the app on the phones it was great so
it leads me to the question of the day
how do you feel about what's happening
to pebble in the future of Fitbit etc in
my case I would save this I miss pebble
it's a great company it had a great
products and I'm just really sad that
fitbit's acquiring it mainly because of
its closed ecosystem if at least Fitbit
would use pebbles mentality of being
open that would be great but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion Frenchy the way goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video was filmed but was I'm fucking out
art come and hit that subscribe button
down below for more videos like this one
it also follow me on twitter heinie
underscore to be better on Instagram
attainment leave it out please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
