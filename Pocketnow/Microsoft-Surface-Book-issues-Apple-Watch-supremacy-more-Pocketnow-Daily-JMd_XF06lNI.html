supremacy in the SmartWatch market the
Microsoft Surface book even though cool
seems to be plaque with a major bug and
a new infographic reveals just how often
people keep using a phone after they've
shattered the display I'm hi Mary venom
tgif and just make sure you don't
chatter that drinking glass as well this
is pocket out daily the official news
today begin with wearables those of you
that are wondering exactly which company
reigns supreme right now it continues to
be the Apple watch and this is just
crazy apple sold apparently within three
months 4.5 million units because well
Cupertino does not provide any figures
but then when you compare it to Samsung
which is the company that follows we're
just talking about 600,000 units and
then everything is buried under the
other category that's not even worth
mentioning this is just to give you an
idea where wearable stand sad news for
the rest but the Android wear is getting
rather better and even though the
Microsoft Surface book is probably one
of the coolest products that the company
announced a few days ago it's sadly a
little problematic as well starting with
two things number one people are
complaining about the hinge whenever you
close the product that seems that it
gets dirty very easily inside because it
doesn't close completely and then the
other complaint is of screen flicker
which is a terrible problem in a tablet
that you're supposed to be using as a
tablet as well so Microsoft let's just
claim that there is a fixed coming soon
stay tuned another cool product that
just blew itself out of proportion when
it came to the price tag is that
Microsoft display dock that enables
continuum surely a lot of people are
still debating if they need continuum
you know having a Windows Phone and then
connecting it to a desktop monitor and a
keyboard but in emerging markets when
that's your only you know computer it
makes a lot of sense and well Microsoft
has just figure that out that at least
in the UK and in Germany people are not
willing to pay an extra hundred dollars
or 75 euros for this product in addition
to the phone so if you buy the Lumia 950
XL you'll actually be getting it for
free just make sure you run because
we're not sure if that's going to be a
limited time deal
with everything Microsoft and for those
of you that joined us in this
appointment for that droid turbo to
being indestructible only for verizon
well the company just picked up the memo
we now have the moto x force which is
pretty much the same exact phone with
two differences number one that doesn't
have that horrible checkmark at the
bottom and number two it doesn't have
the evdo bands for verizon but then
again you get a ton of LTE bands for
every other GSM carrier in the world
which is great news we do not have a
price tag we do assume that it'll get
some motomaker treatment as well and
it's just great news that will get it we
just can't wait to know when and finally
the very hot news today have to do with
motorola again and a very interesting
infographic that they've published
regarding the reasons why they invest in
this whole shattered shield technology
for the droid turbo 2 or moto x force
according to motorola in their studies
they found out that fifty percent of
people continue using their smartphones
with a shattered display particularly
because forty-six percent of them find
that it's just crazy expensive to fix
the phone which makes a lot of sense you
end up paying more than two hundred
dollars in some cases and some of these
people twenty six percent apparently
continue using the phone even after
cutting their finger because the glass
ended up doing so which makes is so
uncomfortable that it does make sense
for people to want a shattered shield
display but it does lead me to the
question of the day does an
indestructible display compel you to
want to buy a smartphone in my case yes
it does it makes a very big difference
for me to want to buy a phone and with
the nano coating and everything else it
just makes it a really cool phone but
then again its availability determines
everything else because a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get those earlier before
