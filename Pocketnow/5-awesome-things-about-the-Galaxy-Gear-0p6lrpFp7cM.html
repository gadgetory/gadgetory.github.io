you don't believe it turn on your TV to
see Samsung's near constant barrage of
nostalgic ads pushing its new Galaxy
gear we've been using the gear for about
a week and we found a lot to like about
Samsung's take on the future of wearable
computing this is Michael Fisher with
pocket now and here's five awesome
things about the Samsung Galaxy gear the
list of things
Samsung gets right with the gear starts
with the unboxing the packaging is
finished in the now-familiar faux wood
grain but the cube shape evokes the
sense of an expensive wristwatch which
of course the gear is and the good first
impression continues as you dive deeper
into the box the presentation of the
watch front and center is excellent with
the tightly packed accessories flanking
it speaking of those accessories Samsung
seems to be fully aware that it's weird
charging cable is well weird but rather
than hide from it the company's embraced
it highlighting the cradle with the same
stitched leather analog as found on the
new Galaxy Notes whether this
presentation suits your particular
tastes depends on you but the company
has definitely made an effort to make
you feel like you're getting your $300
worth that goes for the gears build
quality as well
Samsung isn't necessarily known for
pushing out premium feeling hardware but
if it keeps building devices like this
that reputation is going to start
turning around pretty quickly the gear
might be a little on the large side but
it's steel and sapphire construction
makes a great impression right off the
bat the main body of the watch feels
solid and reliable as does the latch
mechanism containing the speakerphone
the adjustable band retains its soft
curve whether it's being worn or not and
the watch feels great on the wrist our
black and silver model here is a watch
that doesn't scream out for attention
that once people do notice it it
definitely makes an impression and
usually it's a good one an impression
that persists with the gears software
you can get a lot wrong trying to run
Android on the small form-factor of a
wristwatch of course but Samsung has
come out on top here with an inner
face that's clean responsive and
generally intuitive using the top-down
swipe as a persistent back gesture is
very easy to pick up and the gears
single button can be programmed to
launch custom apps with a double click
the two-finger tap for status indicators
and to finger tap and hold for
multitasking might not be intuitive at
first but these gestures are handy once
you get used to them and the shortcuts
on the watch face for quick access to
the dialer and the camera are real time
savers if you want to avoid that app
ribbon speaking of which there's a
dialer and a camera here now look taking
phone calls on your wrist might get you
the atomic wedgie treatment if you let
the Cretans on the playground catch you
doing it but if you watched any of the
classic shows Samsung calls out and it's
gear commercials as a kid doing the old
Dick Tracy is bound to put a smile on
your face what's more it doesn't
actually sound half-bad especially on
the other end where some people couldn't
even tell we weren't using a phone on
the other side of the device then the
optical end of the spectrum putting a
camera on a SmartWatch may not seem the
best use of space or resources at first
but it has applications other than being
a creep in public as we demonstrated in
our gear versus pebble comparison the
app cam dictionary uses the gears camera
to translate text on the fly while
keeping your phone in your pocket which
could be huge for Globetrotters then
even if you're just looking to snap a
few photos when you're out and about the
gears 2 megapixel camera does a passable
job at capturing stills about 10 years
ago when the first camera phones came
out people used to say not a bad photo
for a phone now we can say not a bad
picture for a watch and that goes for
video as well the gear shoots in 720p
and the output ain't bad and yes both
formats can be transferred wirelessly to
the phone to be shared via the social
media app of your choice
speaking of apps Samsung has really done
a solid job of kick-starting the
ecosystem for the gear firing up the
Samsung App Store reveals a pretty hefty
helping of titles ready to load onto the
watch the miniaturized versions of
everything from big names like Evernote
and snapchat to lesser-known titles like
the after mentioned kam dictionary these
pared-down apps don't all give you the
kind of functionality you're used to but
for now they serve their purpose of
extending their parent titles experience
to your wrist and the net effect of all
these apps sitting there waiting for you
after you unbox the gear is twofold one
it multiplies the fun of your new toy
exponentially knowing you can augment it
with a lot of new features and two it
reassures you that you've bought into a
product with the future something whose
functionality will grow rather than
stagnate over time and even with rumors
of the galaxy gear 2 already starting to
simmer in this crazy accelerated tech
world of ours we believe this first
Samsung product of its class will enjoy
a fairly long usable life especially
once its price drops to a level that
will attract more than just early
adopters and gadget lovers like us if
you're looking for a different
perspective on this device hop on over
to our companion video 5 awful things
about the Samsung Galaxy gear and if you
have a gear of your own feel free to let
us know what your experience has been
like drop a comment down below head on
over to our comparison video to see the
Galaxy gear compared against the pebble
smartwatch that is also available for
you but before you go anywhere please
toss us a like if you enjoy the video
and stick around for much more from

you don't miss any of that but until
next time this has been michael fisher
