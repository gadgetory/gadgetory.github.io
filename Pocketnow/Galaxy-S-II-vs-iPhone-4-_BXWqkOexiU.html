pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to compare the iPhone 4 with the
brand new Samsung Galaxy S 2 let's get
to it
okay so what's to talk about here let's
start off with pricing the iPhone 4 is
available in two configurations the 16
gigabyte model is 200 bucks and 32
gigabyte model is 300 bucks now the
galaxy s2 is much more expensive because
it's sold unlocked right now it's not
tied to carriers around the world and
when it is tied
it'll be offered at a lower price it
also has two capacities the 16 gigabyte
version is about 700 bucks right now
very expensive obviously the 32 gigabyte
version is not yet shipping that's going
to be even more expensive although with
the galaxy s 2 you get expandable memory
you don't get that on the iPhone 4 so
you probably don't want to opt for the
higher capacity version because the
price difference is probably more than
buying a micro SD card to expand that
the capacity of the samsung galaxy s 2
so in terms of pricing the iPhone 4 is
definitely lower right now but we'll
have to see how the galaxy s2 gets
priced once it's available on different
carriers now let's talk about build
quality and hardware both devices have a
home button right in the front of real
Hardware home button which is nice to
have in terms of screen size we've got a
3.5 inch Retina display which means is
960 by 640 the PPI of that is 326 and
we'll come back to PPI in a sec the
samsung galaxy s2 has a 4.3 inch screen
much larger the resolution is lower
though WVGA 800 down by 480 across the
ppi here is 217 what PPI means is that
if you take a square inch on both
screens and you count all the pixels
inside the PPI will tell you how many
pixels you will count 326 on the iPhone
4 217 on the samsung galaxy s 2 meaning
that there are more pixels in a given
area on the iPhone 4 text will be
sharper images will be crisper
although the galaxy s 2 is no slouch
when it comes to image fidelity it's got
the Super AMOLED plus panel which has
incredible contrast
color naturalness if that's a word is a
little bit less on the on the Galaxy s2
as we're going to see we'll compare some
photos side by side and viewing angle is
also not as good as it is on the iPhone
4 but both of these have tremendously
high quality screens so that's not
really something that you have to worry
about they fo got both got front facing
cameras 1.3 megapixels on the iPhone 4
and 2 megapixels on the samsung galaxy s
2 so so you have the video chat option
on both with high quality imaging in
terms of build quality and materials use
the iPhone 4 is glass and metal that's
really a glass on the front glass on the
back metal on the sides the Galaxy s2
has a lot of plastic but in hand it
feels very high quality
we've got glass on the front plastic on
the back but again that really doesn't
impact build quality it's very rigid it
feels good in the hand you can't twist
it even though there's a lot of plastic
used and it's a lot lighter than the
iPhone 4 - which is nice but it's also
as you can see here bigger so it's going
to be bigger in the pocket if that's a
consideration for you turning over to
the back we've got cameras here so we've
got a 5 megapixel camera with a flash on
the iPhone 4 and an 8 megapixel camera
on the back of the galaxy s2 with a
flash as well 720p video capture here
1080p video capture on the Galaxy S 2
both of these devices take awesome
photos and video the iPhone 4 used to
have the best imaging when it came to a
smartphone the galaxy s really rivals
that you can see the sample images we
posted in the pocketnow.com review we'll
put up a link in the description if you
want to jump back to that and obviously
no removable backing here on the iPhone
4 but you can remove the back on the
Galaxy S 2 you can access the battery
you can put in your SIM card you can add
a micro SD card if that's what you want
to do we've got a single speaker here
we've got a single speaker here both of
these have about the same volume when it
comes to speaker phone and external
sounds they both have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack as you can see there
we'll turn back onto the front now in
terms of other specs we've got the a4
chip inside of the iPhone 4 which clocks
in at about one gigahertz with 512
megabytes of RAM Samsung's latest and
greatest has much higher specs than that
it's got a 1.2 gigahertz dual core
Exynos processor probably similar to
what we're going to see in the iPhone 5
maybe clocking in a little bit lower
we've got a full gigabyte of RAM here on
the samsung galaxy s2 and it really
shows in terms of browsing performance
and day to day usability and we're going
to compare definitely some speed aspects
of both of these devices to see which
one is faster so both of these devices
have incredibly now both of these
devices obviously have different
interfaces they both need you to slide
to unlock and and we're talking about
the difference between Android and iOS
and the differences are huge and you
know a lot of them in Android of course
you can have multiple panels we've got
only one set up with configurable
resizable widgets and so here's an
example of just one panel I have I can
take this widget I can resize it so
you're getting a lot more versatility on
the Galaxy s2 or in Android in general
the iPhone 4 of course is just icon
after icon there's no app tray although
interestingly the app tray on the Galaxy
s2 is kind of modeled off of the iPhones
home screens here so if you move an icon
you can't arrange it anywhere if we
actually go back we'll go back here and
we'll hit the edit button so when you
move around the icons they kind of all
migrate towards the upper left corner
like you get on the iPhone 4 so we can't
put an icon down here it's going to jump
back over there that's the same
situation here on the samsung galaxy s2
it just jumps right back into its own
configuration just like on the iPhone 4
we can have folders in the samsung
galaxy s2 this is thanks to the TouchWiz
interface we can drop a variety of icons
down here we can take a folder put it up
there add a folder name so this is kind
of Android turned a little bit iOS e on
the samsung galaxy s2 we can hit the
Save button and now we've got a folder
and then if we go over to
folder here we get a sort of pop down
we've got to pop up here on the Samsung
Galaxy s2 looking at the folders inside
of the inside of the program list in
terms of data speeds on the iPhone 4
you'll get speeds of well let's actually
look at some results that we've had over
cellular data so we have to look for
this icon on average you're going to get
about 2 megabits per second down of
course depending on where you live and
sort of the speeds that you can
experience 2 megabits per second down
and sometimes you get as high as 4 and
about 1.5 megabits per second up over
HSDPA although these results aren't
complete I've got the speeds of up to 6
megabits per second down on the galaxy
s2 because it's HSPA+ compatible on AT&amp;amp;T
now the iPhone 5 is likely to have HSPA+
so you can reach those higher data
speeds but right now the Samsung Galaxy
s2 is the phone to get if you want the
fastest data speeds possible okay let's
talk about the all-important web browser
speed comparison test so we're going to
open up Google on both and we've got it
over there so we'll go to Google and
we'll load it here now right away you
can tell the difference between these
two screens we're going to take a look
at an image in a second so let's look at
just this white screen the white is
whiter here on the Samsung Galaxy s2
it's got kind of a almost a milky
covering to it on the iPhone 4 let's
take a look at screen viewing angles and
so we're on automatic screen brightness
here you might see it change so we're
going to turn to the side and you can
kind of get a sense for how that looks
so now it's starting to disappear but
that's pretty good on the iPhone 4 it's
even better you can still see it you can
still see it and we're almost all the
way at 90 degrees it's pretty amazing
the viewing angle of the IPS display on
the iPhone 4 but definitely the galaxy
s2 is no slouch when it comes to screen
visibility so we're going to jump to
images we are going to hey we've got the
same pictures here we'll pick click on
this guy right here and I don't know who
this guy is but take a look at how his
face looks we'll click view full size on
both
and you can kind of get a sense colors
look a little bit more natural on the
iPhone for other the contrast is
incredible on the galaxy s2 we've got
both again turn to automatic screen
brightness just to keep it fair but in
terms of image quality it depends on who
you ask
I think the galaxy s2 looks better but
some people would come in here and say
that the colors are more natural on the
iPhone 4 let's look at another picture
let's type rainforest in here and see
what we can get click rainforest click
the X okay okay and here we go we're
going to just tap on the first image
that we come across and again the colors
look different and the contrast is
definitely noticeably different as well
so we've got very sharp harsh greens
here on the left and they're a little
bit more natural with the iPhone but
then again if you look at the blacks the
rocks they are just really sharply black
so again whether you like color accuracy
or contrast that's a matter of personal
opinion but the iPhone 4 and the galaxy
s ii certainly excel in different ways
let's go into another website let's go
to pocketnow.com see which loads faster
we're actually just going to go straight
to my cat now calm ok so we've loaded
the mobile sites here let's go to the
bottom or click desktop version see
which comes up quicker both over the
same Wi-Fi network and as it's loading I
want to scroll down we got a little bit
of a hesitation there the galaxy has to
finished and while it was loading it
could actually scroll down the page
still going here on the iPhone 4 and
it's going to finish up momentarily now
it's interesting to note and what's kind
of nice to notice that the galaxy s2 has
no bottom bar so you get really the
fullscreen web experience if you ignore
the notification bar at the top on the
iPhone 4 you're going to see the address
bar will disappear let's force it to go
away once you scroll down but you don't
get that really full screen maximum view
we can double tap to zoom in certainly
or sort of pinch to zoom and both will
reach
the column let's actually check out text
we're going to have to find the same
place so we okay so we've got the text
about the same size and if I bring this
phone and close on the screen you're
going to see how crisp and clear it is
on the iPhone because we've got a higher
ppi it looks like print on a paper on
the galaxy s2 it's still really darn
clear but if you look very very closely
you'll see pixels and it's not that bad
it's not that noticeable
we're only comparing these phones
side-to-side and that's probably why
we're being ultra picky about PPI now
let's swipe to the right and see which
page loads faster when we try to get
these headlines in
all right the galaxy s2 is finished and
the iPhone 4 is still loading let's talk
about tab management on the iPhone 4 you
press this button in the right bottom
right corner tab management is something
that phones haven't really gotten right
yet they haven't been able to recreate
the desktop experience thankfully
third-party browsers exist like Dolphin
HD that put the tabs on the top here on
the galaxy s 2 it's kind of a difficult
gesture to get but you pinch like this
and you brought out into the tab view
and click new page or new window and
boom you have a new window to work with
then you can zoom out again that takes a
little bit of practice you can swipe
side by side they look almost the same
right they've got the dots on the bottom
they've got the previews going side by
side and it will show you a little
preview of what is inside the window
it's a pretty good tab management for
both so let's jump into another more
complex website will go to engadget.com
it's got the really long page you go
they're both going to load the mobile
version the galaxy s2 is first with that
we can scroll down take a look at the
various elements and go all the way down
to the bottom the galaxy s2 is is faster
scrolling than the iPhone but that may
or may not be good for you you might
want to take your time with scrolling a
little bit and this is the mobile site
so you can't actually pinch to zoom
let's try to get these at the same time
perfect and they're loading the mobile
versions I'm going to move around on the
page while they load it big difference
here that the galaxy s2 already finished
end of the day the galaxy s2 really has
fantastic web browsing performance that
beats even the King the iPhone 4 in
terms of web browsing speed the iPhone 5
will probably come in and destroy
everyone once again but right now the
Galaxy S 2 Trump's the iPhone 4 in terms
of rendering speed and smoothness of
scrolling and even things like scrolling
down the page when pages are loading and
not getting checkerboards so very
impressive Samsung Galaxy s2 definitely
wins when it comes to web browsing speed
and capability so your choice between
the galaxy s2 and the iPhone 4 is really
going to come down to personal
preference if you are in the market for
the first time for a smartphone and you
want to figure out which operating
system you want to spend time with
because let's face it once you've used
Android for a while or iOS or Windows
Phone 7 you've bought the apps you've
spent the time to customize it's really
a big time commitment depending on on
where you are in the buying process the
Galaxy S 2 is not only a great starter
smartphone but it's a great smartphone
that you know is going to be high-end
for for a couple of years to come yeah
it doesn't have the higher screen
resolution the build quality isn't as
high as the iPhone 4 but it is fast it
is thin it's just a little bit too
expensive right now so if you can wait a
little bit wait until the Galaxy S 2 is
available on other carriers but to be
honest if you wait to that point the
iPhone 5 might be out and that might
blow the galaxy s 2 out of the water so
it really comes down to personal
preference how long you want to wait how
long you want to spend both of these
devices are awesome but it's especially
impressive what Samsung has been able to
do with a galaxy s2 and making a true
contender to the best smartphones that
are out there because this is probably
the best smartphone that is out there
right now at least in our opinion if you
liked this video please give us a thumbs
up and again if you want to see the full
review we've already posted on pocket
now it's got a lot of information about
the Galaxy s2
be sure to check that out if you're
interested thanks for watching and
that's it for now
