Episode two six nine of the pocket now
weekly recorded November 7th at noon
pacific this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and you wished all this stuff existed
because you were a kid that's the best I
could come up with for a joke this week
I'm Juan Carlos magno senior editor
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong out on
the east coast how's it going buddy boy
good afternoon
and yeah you just use your imagination
you're a kid you can do anything you
want please well and use your
imagination for a better joke than I can
right in the moment
apologies for going a little late on the
live broadcast I'm sorting out a few
technical gremlins try and get this live
feed brought to you in as clean a way as
possible not like any other week you
know exactly the the the weekly what's
going wrong with hangouts today exercise
that we play with whenever we try and to
look at what going on with hangouts

for the kitchen novices or experienced
cooks who might be short on time
sourcing the freshest ting
radians measured to the exact quantities
needed this helps reduce food waste and

podcast at pocketnow.com hashtag pn
weekly hashtag pn weekly yeah i'm just
gonna repeat that it's gonna be great
it's all the media we already have some
great comments and and some great
questions coming in on that PN weekly
hashtag which we'll be getting to later
in the show as they do pertain to some
of the news topics pulled from
pocketnow.com some of the top stories of
the week of August 14 2017 this is all
the news that is fit to podcast if you
have a family account on t-mobile you
may be eligible to procure free Netflix
Netflix there we go
from September 12 you have got to have
at least two lines with t-mobile one but
unlimited data thing and the best you'll
get is a to screen plan so take that
into account but if you already have
Netflix
yeah $9.99 bill credits towards that so
if you can take advantage may be
co-opted it's getting into that
back-to-school season University you
might want to co-op with your roommates
to get something on that friend the
iPhone 8 may cost more than $1,000 and
part of that goes to the OLED screen
from the leader of all such things
Samsung KGI securities estimates that
the cost of each display will range
between 125 and 135 dollars per unit and
that is versus a $50 LCD and that's
expected to go on to the 7s or 7s plus
or whatever they're called when they
launched on September 12 prices will
stay up through 2019 as competitors
start producing OLED screens for the big
time and that includes LG LTE is
something that ZTE is rumored to be
bringing are not misread first phone -
LT 88 ent there are way too many letters
story man yeah
backside multi which is you know I think
it's the T sound that has something to
do with it has two screens as told by
Evan blasts and the body folds out and
basically we're talking about something
like the key of Sahara echo supposedly
we are dealing with the less of that
Center bezel and more just but we shall
see 6.8 inches I believe is the figure
there we may see it in the middle of
next month for $650 LG masked the
aperture reading of its main camera for
the V 30 to prevent nosy fans and the
competition from peeking it announced
the F 1.6 aperture for the 16 megapixel
sensor on August 9th after the aperture
did end up leaking on August 1st
pre-release units continue the list
aperture as a 1.7 through the start of
this month though sometimes you just get
it clean things up a little faster and
save that for next time there finally
Google is reporting reportedly closing
in on an investment or an acquisition on
HTC's smartphone operation the word
comes on top of a 13-month excuse me
13-year low in monthly revenues HCC made
the pixel for last year it will do so
again for just the main model model this
year and Google owned Motorola between
2012 and 2014 but has been exerting more
control over its ideals of Android
phones as of late so it makes sense the
cards just happened to be aligned for
this little deal to go through
the question is Oh Google be able to
take advantage in you know it will other
OEMs do the same thing as they have
during the Motorola years and start of
shirk away and maybe I think that's
definitely one of the big questions but
what do you think Jules do you think
Google is apt to operate HTC as a
secondary brand or do you think that
this will they will transition over into
a
being more because we didn't we had this
problem with Motorola where the Nexus
was not really intended to be a consumer
facing phone so Motorola operated as a
separate division the Nexus was sort of
Google's in-house brand for developers
and that way they didn't step on the
toes of any of their other manufacturers
I feel with Google positioning the pixel
as a consumer facing phone they're less
afraid of turning off their other
partners and that they could be looking
at an in-house division which could
scrap the HTC brand as we know it and
even with such a high repute I mean you
know they've done is excellent we've
never been able to fault them for
building a nice phone I mean it just
just doesn't have the sales cloud to
support it and I mean maybe you know
that might be to google's credit to
actually do whatever it wants to it and
maybe the comfort that you might not
care that much I mean we're still
talking about even though it's ideal
Google's really made the point they want
you know it's been pushing designs and
it basically scrapped Nexus in the
middle of its development cycle just to
start the pixel to you know have this
new narrative going on here so ways your
grand we already have a comment on this
from Andrew Wallace at fat produce
hashtag p-n weekly with the talk of
Google buying HTC I wonder if we will
even see a sequel to the U 11 especially
with sales or lack of and I don't want
to poopoo what HTC has been able to
accomplish over the last two years from
the HTC 10 to the U 11 but there's a
part of me that kind of hopes that if
Google really does front the cash for
this that they opted not to operate HTC
a second I would love to see HTC's
designs for lower-cost phones rolled
into Android one and I would and and
then we can have a Google that is just
hard focused on delivering their vision
for what a flagship Android phone could
be as opposed to splitting their
resources in their talent between two
different divisions yeah I mean we're
also talk to speaking of divisions we're
talking about 5vr which is also a pretty
you know good standing in the VR
community right now and there's some
talk that Google is doing a little
combination with motion tracking to do
an hour VR device with HTC now of course
Google daydream HTC vive is also making
is supposedly making a headset for that
Android platform but I have a feeling
that's now you know what's funny is it
because like I don't want to put all my
tech eggs in one basket you know there's
some of those rumors from last month
where people were talking about HTC
potentially spinning off the vibe into
its own company I would actually prefer
that I mean I would love to see what
Google and HTC could do together for
daydream that's very compelling that's
very interesting but it's also like I
don't want to lose too much competition
in such a new consumer space and so I
would really like to see HTC phones just
go just go to Google just just vaya con
Google and then we have this separate
thing where maybe a steam like entity
picks up five because they've already
been a partner and that's where we see
them able to do battle against you know
oculus and Microsoft and all the other
new players and hopefully that's a shot
in the arm where Google starts taking VR
and AR even more seriously as consumer
facing not just these like fun add-ons
like we've got this daydream headset you
can kind of use your phone but really
getting after that standalone VR or AR
experience so that people could really
experience what Google plans for that
and then we again we have more
competition hopefully building up a
healthier VR environment for consumers I
mean I've always found valve as a
software visionary and you know its main
period but it was not hey there was John
Freeman I can't even think of the name
because I don't game as much as anyone
else does here on YouTube but yeah you
know it's not new steam machines are not
led by the hardware is not theirs and
you know I'm wondering if you know in
case software visionaries Johnny I agree
but it's because we've seen steam trying
to get after some kind of hardware
portfolio you know it's the same thing
like steam hasn't been able to
Pete in exactly the same way that Nvidia
or Razer have had like living room
solutions controllers different types of
tablets branded PCs and they tried that
whole steam box right you know they had
specs for manufacturers to build steam
compatible hardware a way to try and
compete against consoles didn't really
flesh out I think they were just a
little too early for this living room
game streaming experience that now
Microsoft and stone and Sony are really
trying to get after but this could be
their entry instead of just competing
against consoles instead of just trying
to replicate the console experience with
a PC game why not lead the way on what
the future of consumer VR could be you
know they're already at the forefront
oculus and vive are way ahead of the
curve in terms of just the raw tech but
really polishing the edges really making
this friendly and accessible for all
comers especially it's slightly more
premium price points that could be
steams way of really becoming a hardware
broker which is benefited by their
software licensing and their software
distribution platform all the time we
have you know
hardware and software entities being
separate and we've seen you know some of
the combine and you know just like you
know Google Emoto and I mean perhaps
even Sega to a certain extent with many
good because because what you know their
Hardware never really I mean a computer
up until you know satiny I would say CD
Saturn and then like a hardware competed
really well until I realized what a
monstrosity my Genesis had become with
the Sega CD in the 32x okay that's right
that's right apt out that's where I had
the big note button and I became I mean
I had a Sega in a Nintendo but that's
where I just kept going with Nintendo's
after that they couldn't keep up the
counter and so that all they had left
was softly at that point you know was
just Fred franchises and I pinions you
know like you know he it's like once you
put all the wheels together and then
you start losing them again it's you
know it doesn't end well you know ends
up with you know a merger or acquisition
or just the disbursements
in the case of Motorola as we've talked
about before right so we'd have a couple
more comments just on this story again
this is I mean this was literally
breaking news for us we were putting
together the show while I was trying to
figure out camera problems and writing
the script for this narrative from from
at legendary scoop but the u11 was so
good this year and I agree it was a
great phone but a big problem with HTC
and it's a it's a problem we've listed
with a number of other companies trying
to really crack North America is how do
you resonate with consumers and right
now I think Google would have more
momentum in reaching out directly doing
their own advertising their own ad buys
where HTC has been a little reluctant to
jump into that space from Ed maudlin
maybe we'd see a g11 and again that's
potential but I think if Google were to
buy out HTC they wouldn't want to play
with branding exercises they would be
buying this division for their expertise
not to co-brand and I think that was why
Huawei and Nexus fell apart was Huawei
didn't want to build a phone that their
label wasn't gonna be on and so I think
Google isn't looking to share the
limelight anymore with with a
manufacturer especially I mean they've
you can hear that in the rumors about
the whole sense of pressure-sensitive
frame with the edge that's becoming
active edge like you know just it's
taking these features and it's making it
their own you know what I don't know I
don't know how successful it will be in
terms of the integration process and
then you know just making you know
obviously they have they don't have much
to lose so I mean they really don't and
and for me it's can you just focus on
making a killer phone I mean if we lose
the you 11 to get an amazing pixel I
think we'll all be sad for a bit because
I mean I came up with HTC is an OEM and
ODM making under like the Audiovox label
and the Sanyo label and all these weird
sort of cell phone labels way back in
the day with Windows
mobile and I will be sad to see those
letters go HTC but if this is the
Phoenix of rebirth for both Google and
HTC getting us back to what we loved
about necks I and what we like about the
pixel but hopefully will be refined for
a future phone and it we know that that
HT division lives on under Google's
umbrella I think we'll be okay but to
that same point
Edie maudlin on Twitter I tweeted just
don't bring back ultrapixels and so I
think maybe tell you yeah right III
don't I don't think the problem was the
ultra pixel I think the problem was the
number of ultrapixels and where we had
that for ultra pixel camera like on the
what was on the on the m77 yeah yeah and
now they made too but you know I mean
see they called the HTC 10 you know what
they had ultrapixels into like they did
call it an ultra pixel camera and no
there wasn't a half-bad solution for
selfie camera so I mean I mean I again I
mean if we're talking about TC 10 to you
11 I really wish that HTC 10 selfie
camera had made the man a man you know
just reminiscing about Frick you know
little steel sheaves of or aluminum
sheet it was just a sham for engines and
right like I had the red HTC well I
still have it somewhere in the back over
there it's like man those were the times
so I just want to couple minutes to this
story just cuz I think it was such an
interesting way that information was
disseminated online and how people were
pitchforks at the recce excuse me I'm
still working off this dry cough for the
LGV 30 this this story about the
aperture on the V 30 was at
xda-developers or was it ours
who went to press with the the
announcement that LG had misrepresented
the I was sourced to back to a Russian
outlet named Ted not or something like
that and basically they went through the
posts going
you know talking about oh hey here are
some early camera samples and they went
through the exit data so I mean just you
know you know it wasn't kind of
international thing going on there and
you know if there is a so it reported
back in F 1.69 on those exif data pieces
and those were the camera samples that
were released after the August 31
embargo right and you know we had our
units you know week before then and they
were still reporting at 4.7 they
announced the F 1.9 excuse me at four
point six aperture on August 9th they
have plenty of time to revise their
software even on these pre-release units
so that no confusion whatsoever could
you know take place and that's you know
transparency and consistency RFI two big
pigs and you know if you don't have that
I mean LG from what I've heard from you
guys you and Hyman leave done a great
job of getting the narrative on each
little aspect of the V 30 from camera
and you know input optics and the audio
too so yeah
you know I find it you know odd lapse if
you will yeah it's it's a tricky
situation because again when we're
looking at how LG has been putting out
information on this phone and the weird
sort of there was a strange split I mean
if we want the behind the scenes here
there was a strange split in the embargo
where day one announcements were were
focused more on aesthetics and just a
general overview on the phone and then
they had a secondary embargo on specific
features and so that's why you saw this
sort of two day explosion of videos for
the V 30 was because there were some
things that LG really wanted to save
post announcement in Berlin and and I
think this is why the V 30 became the
hottest talking point of Aoife this year
there weren't a lot of phones to compete
against it I was really taken by the
sony xperia x z1 compact even though
that's a miserable name to say every
time you want to talk about the little
phone but that that's why we saw this
this breakdown and so when we talk about
transparent
see the fact that it took LG this long
to reply to this issue is definitely
problematic as part of their narrative
but I think it's interesting they kind
of engaged in some sort of not
industrial espionage but like media
espionage in trying to obfuscate
specific aspects of the phone until they
were ready to talk about it and I wonder
you know do you think that that's a
sound strategy they didn't want someone
to spoil their reveal until they were
ready to make it but in doing so they
created a small problem for the
narrative that they were trying to
create yeah I mean LG it you know it
they make it sound like a boutique phone
but they're trying to hit a massive
audience you know following on from 97
yeah it's obviously 30 is their pivot
you know so the v10 and the V 20 were
enthusiast devices there is all these
things are coming up together you know
it's like oh this is this is this year's
flagship model from LG so it's like
these storylines don't really the you
know you have to really make a crescendo
out of it and I don't think but I don't
think it's fair for you to you know go
the whole you know go all out on the
pre-press treatment but then when you go
into the post process it's like alright
that's that's it and there is no
confusion whatsoever and like the first
time around like I caught a whiff of
Android Central and true excuse me
Android Central's Andrew Montmartre onok
who received just the simple
confirmation from LG yes this is the F
one point six is the app sure that's it
and we never really got an explanation
okay why is the f1 points at it do you
guys know and it took in like a few days
afterwards until you know a multi press
you know statement was sent out from LG
explain the corporate espionage and nosy
fans - well and from ed maudlin on
Twitter
LG trolling people who don't know what
prototype
because I mean all of the coverages have
been put out on the v30 so far and this
is why we've been a little coverage
light for this phone even though I think
it's pretty clear that we've been
enjoying our time with these units I
mean it came in a plain brown cardboard
box
there's no badging or I know there's no
piano label there's no carrier label
this is prototype hardware and so we
didn't want to start going into exacting
charts and graphs for our audio and
camera reviews we've been a little a
little light on coverage for things like
screen quality just because we don't
want to misrepresent what this phone is
capable of before we have a proper
consumer release and so that's just our
last little disclosure on V 30 for you
guys but it looks like we've got someone
joining the live chat let me get my
window back up here because I always fly
blind but I heard someone in the
background and fahadh from Frank how's
it going thank you of course thank you
for joining the PocketNow weekly we've
got a lot to talk about with your phone
in your crowdfunding campaign and Jules
if you wouldn't mind getting us kicked
off while I pull up my show notes yeah
indeed so Frank
this whole crowdfunding project was
actually started up by a person that we
hope to be what technical difficulties
that never happens
Oh ever never happened no yeah not yeah
so that that's gonna happen but his name
is Moe Omer and he's right there
Mohammad welcome onto the show thank you
all right we've got to house now and
I've got my notes up here and so really
quickly if you guys could help us just
explain for the audience what is Frank
and how did you come up with such a
killer ad campaign to discuss Frank with
potential enthusiasts so pretty much
what Frank is is a essentially a
movement or a push towards sort of
a sort of different idea when it comes
to phones in the mobile market and
pretty much what we're trying to do is
create this sort of well take this idea
that the big guys aren't your only
option so you're samsung's your apples
they're not sure only options and we
want to provide an option to consumers
looking for a lower and a lower price
but also don't want to pay a lot of
money and don't want to get a bad phone
we just want to be able to find
something that's good for the everyday
person we're not trying to beat
Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 or anything like
that we're just trying to find an option
for people who aren't looking for the
best of the best but they're looking for
something that will work for them there
but I want to get into the specific
context of what you've uh started
because you're only 17 and this this all
came about last year when have you
realized oh I'm paying a thousand
Canadian dollars this so we have to
unicorn it's here
this isn't you know Canadian company and
a teenage you know see our CTO
technically he but he found it company
CEO is that God and we you've been
noticed by many VCS fit metric apples
let's send them tell tell me the process
was like and after you realized I'm not
gonna be paying a thousand dollars for
an iPhone honestly I think it's it's
something that most techniques go
through at least once when you realize
you just dropped another thousand
dollars or another seven hundred dollars
if you're in the US for the new galaxy
s7 and he realized one year later you
crack the screen and you put a warranty
on it and you're like I have to go buy a
new phone and your only other options at
that point are going to a two-year or
three-year contract which everyone hates
and at that point for me it was just
like we have to do something about that
because I'm a I'm a consumer I I watch
this show every week so I'm really in
the tech space and I feel like there
aren't enough options for people we just
want something that's good enough and
even though I'm a techie most most
phones I've used that in 2017 have been
more than good enough for me to use but
they all cost a lot of money or they're
just
not available for us and I think that's
something that needed to change and at
that point I decided as a designer as a
entrepreneur there had to be some way we
could come up with almost almost a phone
that you would not find in North America
and you see this big shift in the Asian
African markets where you can buy a
really good phone for $20 the Shiomi is
the Mays use and all these guys but we
have nothing like that in here in the US
and Canada and I think that that needed
to change so I worked I worked on it
from a would by myself for a while and
then I found Fahad who's a lot been a
lot better than me when it comes to
business and entrepreneurship and
marketing and I learned a lot from him
so we work together to be able to find
this company and find a good medium for
what we want to create yes for that
context on there because you know we've
been talking about this as it pertains
to the United States market quite a bit
would you say that the Canadian market
is is fairly similar in how consumers
are sort of programmed into a 2 or 3
year cycle we've been we've been trying
to stress that that conversation you
know there are options for unlocked
devices it's just it's a lot harder for
those phones to gain any kind of
visibility with consumers here because
of how we've been programmed to buy
phones we totally agree with you and
that that's exactly how consumers
mindsets have been programmed and it has
a lot to do with the amazing marketing
of Samsung and Apple and and so on so
forth they they eat up the Airways and
so actually in development as we said no
matter what we develop we need to have
an amazing kick-ass very unique
marketing strategy to allow us to you
know open up those Airways to to you
know be edgy enough and cringe-worthy
enough at times
that people are looking and saying this
is interesting just to get a little bit
of buzz you know eat the slide right in
there that's that's what we're trying to
do
and how we're tackling on our marketing
and how we want to shift people's
thinking and you hit it you know rather
than head
these are husband's consumers have been
trained to be okay with two three-year
contracts in the US and Canada to $5,000
phones but the Frank movement which we
keep referring to is so much more than
this one device that we're putting out
there right now the kind of fund it's
the idea that we should be as consumers
helping other consumers shift their
thinking in how they're holding these
big guys accountable to what they're
selling them and to what is being
provided to them and so we like to think
of it as so much more than just a phone
this is where we're starting at you know
we have a product and we need to crowd
fund it but we want to be so much more
as a company in our mission and the
values that we want to hold and in the
consumer behavior that we want to engage
indeed indeed so I guess there are a few
points because you know when you come
into the arena of the tech enthusiast
then you're gonna have more critical
Minds pointing at you and we've had
media coverage that has been read brash
about this campaign so I want to try and
dissect mmm now you you you basically I
I saw your interview with tech Opia the
other day and you went to do this a
little bit but if you want to delve into
more about how you and I came up with
the design that are the spec set that
you want the achieve and then the
procurement process because I think
realistically if you're you know it
would take it would take hundreds of
thousands or even millions of dollars to
bootstrap an own designed a bar and an
own you know manufacturing a contract
with a group and you know just even the
labor to find that all so these
audiences for for the tech enthusiasts
there's this like bloodhound like nose
for any kind of controversy or
misrepresentation of what a company
might be trying to deliver and I feel
that that's become woven into part of
this narrative but I was really hoping
that we could get your take on what is
it
you guys are actually trying to
represent and actually trying to deliver
yeah no we appreciate your sentiment and
you know what we're we're a little taken
back by this this this you know
phenomenon that you're kinda you know
speaking to this this you know the the
almost attack at some point you know
that we were trauma that we were gonna
surprise that with with our launch of I
think I'll start off here kind of
explaining how we went about the design
MO had actually approached me you know a
few years back now and he said hey pod
we work together I was running an
entrepreneurship Center out of Carleton
University has a lot of different
students who are starting their startups
and business well that no came to me and
said I got this great idea I want to
design a phone and my response was
that's crazy you design a phone
scratching Wow
that's millions of dollars and as you
put it but labor to keep this said you
know is this something you really want
to know he said well you know look at my
sketches let's look at it and we sat
down and we you know designed what we
thought would be this is perfect balance
of the phone price and honest pricing
you know and how can we balance this
this to enter the middle market of
phones we're having a high spec phone
with you know at low cost and fair fair
pricing and so we actually spent quite a
bit of time designing what we would do
if we could designer and then took that
and actually went to several different
manufacturers through the Alibaba
platform to allow us to you know procure
is there any manufacturer out there that
you know can help us build this with
these existing specs that we're looking
for and these existing things and many
of the manufacturers came back to us
saying oh we don't we know you're doing
a custom mold for this would be too
difficult but we have this kind of
matches what you have or we can we can
kind of fleet this and build this this
way and so we actually went back and
forth with several different prototypes
but four different prototypes with
different manufacturers
negotiating back and forth till we
landed on what we thought
best mold and the best specs that
compared to what we wanted if we could
design it from the bottom up okay that's
a fair assessment and you know you
you're pretty honest in saying that okay
we've always had a a real target you
know per unit production target of $150
now there's also this other you know
kind of spar in terms of the pricing
because you know you promoted the $180
price point which is the earliest bird
tier and that's gone now and then you're
suddenly starting to creep up to 210 and
I think there was like another like a to
39 or something and then ultimately if
you were to go on you know reap the full
retail that would be 280 and we looking
at in terms of the competition many
different options so what was them that
process about what was that what we're
trying to find that in that process so I
think the beauty of crowdfunding
campaigns is that the entire and we're
gonna hear today
priority of it is a market test and the
entirety of a crowdfunding campaign is a
test to market test your consumers and
try and see what works and what doesn't
right and you know we work with you know
we did a lot of different market surveys
before we ever really start pricing and
we figured the 180 early bird works
really well it's actually still
available so there's still a little bit
200 units left at the 180 so if anyone's
watching this wants to check it out
please do check out our IndieGoGo
basically yeah
afterwards it creeps up to 210 and then
we have a 230 price point the 279 price
point was a retail price point if we
were going to go into stores now I don't
think we're gonna go into stores I think
it's gonna be purely an e-commerce play
in the long run and we'll never actually
have to go to 279 because we agree with
you it's too much and that's actually
why a lot of phones and exist cost that
much because as soon as you go into
retail you're having a layer of margin
that the holder needs needs to actually
make right so you go over manufacturer
to retail to consumer and every time
you're adding a bit of margins on this
so if we can go directly manufacturer to
consumer we cut the middleman as we've
been saying and we're able to keep our
pricing fairly low and so the pricing
right now we're testing it you know can
we do 180 can we do 200 what can we work
with you know people are looking at some
of the Alibaba stuff and saying oh well
you can get the phone in at 1:21 you
gotta buy 3,000 right you know so
holding inventory you know marketing and
getting it out there there's the cost of
running a start-up that I think you know
some of the the audience that we see out
there on reddit and so on so forth might
not be aware of and the reality is when
we look at some of LG's phone through
Google's phones the cost of build is
probably you know just a bit higher but
it's the cost of everything else that
adds on that makes them $800 because
they've got to take them from
manufacturer to wholesale to carrier to
them consumer and so everyone wants
their cut a long way and so our hope is
to you know be able to take that away
just look directly to consumers and
again that a lot of that polls to our
marketing and can we capture enough of
an audience with our marketing to be
able to produce a high quality phone and
ensure that it's it's its quality and
that's the big part here too is that
we've spent over six to eight months now
doing Quality Assurance on this one unit
you know only my stuff from China we're
not really sure right that's that's the
big question is it gonna be good is it
gonna work is it work with an about
screen production yield rates for the
one another IndieGoGo project which is a
Eva V and they've had a nightmare for
time trying to deal with that I want to
go back to mo for a second here because
and this is sort of a personal gate
question relating to you know the whole
you know that kind of a discussion with
the price too and you because like you
talked to like-minded people or you know
people yet your friends and family and
even strangers out there and you've you
know kind of made this assessment hey
this is not right let's do something
about it how deep you know where are you
going with these conversations what did
you find it
just a personal litmus test out there
well I found that a lot of people didn't
even realize how much that how much
they've been affected by this sort of
issue and obviously I'm very very
involved in the tech space and tech
community online so I've asked people
online on on forums and people I know
that are very very into this this
industry versus what people average
everyday people are talking about and
what I found is that people as a whole
just don't like what they're getting but
they find that there's just no other
options for them available and even
though there are they're just there like
for example there are public phone the
blue phones which actually own one
myself but no one knows about them and
that's the problem you need to the
reason why our marketing tactics are the
way they are is part of the reason is
that it captures it captures an audience
and whether it's for good or for bad you
take notice because companies don't a
lot of companies don't do that you don't
see Samsung advertising like that or
Apple and as a whole people need to meet
the gap sure people's attentions for
them to be able to realize hey this is
something that is available and that's
something that people just haven't
realized what we have a tweet to that to
that topic to from from Peter hatin
using the P n weekly hashtag he wonders
if cringe-worthy buzz is really the
right sort of buzz that will attract and
he says remembering what happens to the
early one-plus campaigns question I
think that marketing agencies and
creative people ask on a daily basis I
say it's a million dollar question right
is this kind of cringe-worthy funny
approach you know when you take comedy
approach some people find funny and some
people find it crazy with it where you
get this you know extremes and when you
get extremes conversations happen right
you know we've got an article on the
verge because of some of the extremes
that are happening people are starting
to talk about it if we kind of went out
with lengha hey check it out this is a
cool
who would actually be talking about it
right we want to get the conversation
going and so you know that I'd say
that's always a good question but I
would say you know if we look at 1 1
pluses early days where they are now
it clearly worked for them in some cases
that's not exactly something you would
hate to emulate that kind of know so I I
definitely had to ask this because you
know I come from a background in
marketing and advertising well actually
more casting but we will save that for
another podcast did you guys work with a
marketing team or PR team to craft this
because the first thing I thought of
when I saw the Frank spot on IndieGoGo
was like this was starting to feel
really reminiscent of something like
Dollar Shave Club we work closely with a
creative agency called creative vision
who actually worked on the Dollar Shave
Club campaign we very much said you know
when we went in that's the approach we
want which was you don't need six razors
to shave you know just like you don't
need that 16 gigabytes of RAM in your
phone or you know you know a Snapdragon
processor that makes Google searches a
millisecond faster right we want to give
you something solid at a solid price so
we're happy that you just said that you
know that means that we're on message
and we've done we've done a good job and
we were very very close to the creative
agency creative vision they're actually
a good friend of mine that personal
connection so we were very lucky to have
that support indeed indeed I do want to
go back into the whole crowdfunding ass
by now lots of arguments as to whether
you know going into VC or going into
crowdfunding would be the right path but
I was curious about the actual crowd
front of funding platform that you chose
you know for the run-up to and you know
you've been turning the kicks started
you know the traditional platform but
then you go and you know a couple days
out from the
launch you decide to go with the
IndieGoGo which you know it has the
option for project leaders to run with
the money that they have if they do not
meet their goals and you know that has
led to some sort of some controversies
in the past
you mentioned though in that tech obeah
interview that they offered a pretty
good promotional package for you
so like what was the what was weighing
that out like between Kickstarter and
IndieGoGo IndieGoGo yeah thanks for that
question I guess first and foremost we
did we did use a fixed model so in our
campaign is just like a starter campaign
you have to raise the full amount or
everyone gets refunded
so while IndieGoGo does offer the
flexible option we did not choose that
because we're not able to you know meet
our demands we want to be able to be
very honest and frank with our
supporters right if we hit our goal
we're able to make it don't and that's
it but into the specification is about
why IndieGoGo and and you know the point
that you brought up I got a call from
one there you know lead strategist
almost a week out from our campaign
because we had been obviously promoting
in our pre-launch and gaining the
support there and without a call from
them and they said hey we'd love for you
to use the Google platform kickstart and
I you know I remember saying I'm a week
out you're gonna have to convince me I
think there's no way why would I do that
you know like it's gonna keep you know I
may be shooting myself in the foot they
said no no no make it worth your while I
said okay well let's talk and they
guarantee does a couple of newsletter
promotions guaranteed ones would have
eight million subscribers on those
newsletters they guarantee does feature
on the front page on the front of the
IndieGoGo page when we want the
guarantees from social media and then in
addition the guaranteed a consultant
weekly calls with their one of their
strategic consultants to help us develop
our our campaign page to help us go
through the different phases of launch
mid-end and they
to work their PR team to work with us
and ensuring that we get some good PR
and the kind of looking at all that
looking at you know the possible return
on the newsletters that they're offering
and a possible return on the
consultation call that we said this is
more than King star ever offered us and
and so we went to the team we sat down
we researched a lot between the two
platforms and you know we didn't see
that big of an advantage to going to
Kickstarter because of what was being
offered now to us with IndieGoGo and
honestly it was a tough decision we sat
there and every are we gonna kick
ourselves in the foot for doing this and
honestly sometimes you still question
that because now everyone's questioning
us but you know we've been really happy
with IndieGoGo support they've been on
calls with them to make sure that
everything is going well how we
developed our perks there's a lot
strategy that goes into optimizing
crowdfunding campaigns that personally
as someone who's done a lot of business
and never had to really think about it
so having an expert go through our page
with us and say you know you should have
video you should have pictures here you
should you know adjust your perk so that
that's this way that'll create you know
better conversion rates that has been
huge and so you know we're very thankful
for IndieGoGo and we're also working
last part they offered was to be able to
work with their arrow certification so
arrows as a program that they run with a
partner with that helps individuals who
are manufacturing to work and do all the
assurance with them and so we're in the
process of getting certified to get our
arrow checkmark and it'll be a badge on
our campaign page but we think that
would be a big part in ensuring that you
know when we are successful with our
IndieGoGo campaign that we can actually
deliver and deliver on time because we
know how important that is and we know
how many people have been burned our
funding campaigns now this because this
might be a bit deep in the weeds a
little bit wonky or maybe something that
you can't really speak to but I was just
curious as to whether or not indiegogo
any of the reps that you had spoken to
there had experienced anything like the
backlash that you guys had for changing
that over if this was something that
they were prepared for in the discussion
that they were having with you
that's a great question in all honesty I
don't know I asked I said hey I've been
you know never giving this we've been
promoting this am i get is this gonna be
a problem
and they said no we don't think it
should be a problem this is kind of what
it was at first but we have been in
communication with them and I and I have
expressed kind of our concern now that
the backlash is happened I said hey guys
this is some feedback there's clearly
there are individuals out there at the
tech community who do not trust
IndieGoGo as a brand and so I you know I
said it conservatively like I hope you
can forward this on to your leadership
team that's something that that's
important for you guys to work on your
on your brand and your trust with your
consumers because there clearly is a
segment of people that I am now missing
out on because because of the brand that
we've attached herself to but in terms
of support and in terms of everything
else you know when they've been there
and they I think you know I'm really
happy with how our campaign is doing
right now and how it looks and all that
and that has a lot to do with the
consultations in Gales so we also have
another one on here oh go ahead Jules go
please go ahead because we have a
question here from from Twitter that I
hope you guys can expand on just a
little too because there's so many
moving parts when it comes to a phone
launch this is from Andrew Wallace how
do you propose to make a move into the
United States smartphone market with so
much competition from bigger players and
the the the sort of inception of this
brand is coming from a very Canadian
perspective there's obviously a lot of
Venn diagram overlap between Canadian
consumers and United States consumers
but then moving beyond that to what what
kind of conversations have you guys
faced in terms of smartphones across the
world market there are obviously a lot
of differences moving from region to
region maybe a number of areas like I
keep thinking about some of my relatives
in Latin America who might not be quite
so in touch with a Dollar Shave Club
kind of conversation for something
that's become such a mission-critical
communications device so we would
definitely love to expand later on to
Latin America Asia markets that sort of
thing but if you're looking at we did a
lot of market research and when you're
looking at the amount of competition
in Asia compared to the US for example
it's it's night and day honestly and you
see this sort of allegiance to some of
the bigger brands in the US and that's
something that a lot of people a lot of
people are okay with but even though
there are there is a lot of there are a
lot of phones available in the US the
tech geek market like us like people
like us will know about it the vast
majority of people won't and that's
reason why this phone is targeted
towards the everyday person the person
kind of just grown to Facebook and they
see a frank ad there and be like oh
what's that and honestly we just want to
be able to provide something that is
good for everyone and honestly having a
phone with four gigabytes of RAM it's
the core gigabytes of storage at $180
$200 it's gonna entice a lot of people
just because it's really isn't available
for the vast majority of people and
people who it is available for it just
don't know about it and so even though
there are options available we would
love to provide another option just
because compared to the other other
markets like in Asia we just don't have
enough competition rather than too much
there really isn't
fiat indeed I want to get to the support
infrastructure that you might want to
build because once you start if you do
end up funding your goal then you have
to consider you you start after and then
it becomes a game of software it becomes
a game of hardware too because you'll
you know they break their price or
something you'll actually have to you
know I think you guys offer a $50 kind
of extended warranty but I mean how is
that gonna go I mean is that a concern
you guys have faced especially because
part of the infrastructure you're paying
so much for with some of these other
devices is the ability to kind of just
traipse your way into a carrier store
and plop down something and hope to
receive some kind of timely service
based on on that relationship we have
our extended warranty which is you know
$50 no questions asked
place your device and you know it's most
effective for us to replace their device
outright and then see what we can do
with the customer service model doing
that you know taking the time to try and
fix some of these small things with
these devices that are already low cost
it's probably the opportunity cost and
physical costs that go into it are
bigger than just replacing the device
but in terms of software which is a big
one here there is a software server
infrastructure with our manufacturers
right now that will allow us to provide
software updates and so we're working
closely with their team to ensure that
we can you know provide one Android 7.0
right out of the box which is which is
what we promised which is what we get
rid of to deliver but then timely
updates for that as security patches we
also have a lead engineer on our team I
worked for seven years at blackberries
of Quality Assurance engineer and has
been actually you know a big leader in
helping us with that and in addition
what's been actually really supportive
and awesome to hear is that a lot of
people that reached out to us in the
last week in two weeks
some VP past bp's from blackberry and
software that have said we love what
we're do what you're doing let me know
if I can help you let me know please
or two to do software at least whatever
it is we can I'd love to be a part of
your team and so I think if we hit our
goal or our team's gonna expand and you
know we have the room for that we have
people who are passionate here in Canada
that wanna you know revive and you read
and so in partnership with our
manufacturers the infrastructure is
there and then our team is growing we're
really able to already set to be able to
continue to do updates and security
updates and you know the for the first
home and in how much we're producing and
all that we're barely breaking even and
there isn't much profits to be made but
that's the goal of the first time around
is to build a brand instead to gain that
customer trust to build that retention
and build product but as we grow we'll
be able to develop more devices which
will increase our margins it's a it's a
low margin high volume business
especially
budget devices especially when you're
entering what's considered the long tail
of the market you know we're not tak
taking on the big guys directly you know
you know we joke about it we're taking
on those those smaller pieces at the end
the consumers the moms and the dads who
don't want thousand-dollar hyphens with
the mom to death that want to buy their
phone for their child 13 years old but
so that is where we're going with so we
were great with the infrastructure and
we know we can deliver the software in
terms of the actual software itself now
you guys are dealing with the
manufacturer for that but you bring up
um oh you brought up the heck you owned
a blue smartphone and that itself has
been very controversial eight ups for
running the firmware and you know in
China these tend to be insidious things
where you know vendor firmware vendors
you know so I'm wondering like how much
homework do you have on this stuff and
you know what are your like do you have
any contingency plans if something
happens like you know what's up
well so we've been working very very
closely with the manufacturer and
obviously there's never a 100% guarantee
that everything everything will go right
and we're not expecting it we are
expecting it to but you never know what
could happen and that's why we've set up
our entire contract with the
manufacturer set up so we can put them
accountable for any issues that may come
up whether it's software or hardware
issues we can hold them accountable for
anything that happens and that's why
we're if we if and hopefully when we get
funded we will be visiting China
ourselves to oversee the production of
the phones of software and everything in
between in addition in addition I think
you know right now we're working with
the manufacturer to allow for software
updates but obviously we would like to
bring them home and I think that's Duke
basketball right the goal is to be able
to find enough phones and get started
and get the ball rolling and maybe then
you know look at VC funding later on
that helps us grow and bring it to you
know our team at home do the servers and
do dogs
I think that's definitely the trajectory
of our growth but you gotta start
somewhere
I think that's you know we're we're
saying is that we're starting here this
is our help us get started and this
might be one phone it might not be the
best but trust us now and what we build
in the future is stellar spectacular and
we'll continue to work within the
movement and philosophy that we believe
in which is the Frank movement of honest
technology that is for the everyday
consumer yeah so how can expect next
year that you're gonna release like a
$2,000 premium on that right now I can
screenshot that you know I mean
everything can happen just as you know
what you've said about the soccer you
know so like a couple more I think these
should be good to wrap up on although
you know I just forgot them because my
mind is all in a tizzy from that I was
on your mind because my jet jet lagged
mind wasn't gonna help us with in that
case I'm gonna try it because you were
you had a great train of thought in
terms of revolving around the user and
you know this soul putting faith in a
company and it's concepts and then you
have the product itself which you know
isn't really spectacular what do you
think what would you like people to pay
more into if they're going to put in
their hard-earned cash into this do do
you want them to think more about as the
canadian company that was led that is
led by 70 year old motto ins or the
phone which itself is you know fits
their needs and fits their image of what
they do in their daily lives you know
I'd say the unibrow but yes sorry I
didn't catch you there okay it's always
gonna be a bit of both but you know I
mean you would hope you know they have
you in the back of their minds they have
Frank as a brand name that represents
something you know why the crowdfunding
can be you know first to be successful
we need people to actually want the
product right we need people to believe
in us for the future and the longevity
and take a chance on that and believe in
the movement and believe in what we're
doing
we need them to want the product we need
that to you know look at the phone and
say you know what this does everything I
wanted to do this was built you know
with me in mind and a little extra this
is a device that can do everything I
wanted to do email text called tweet
snapchat Instagram but he can do
everything I wanted to do and work but
at the same time it is you know made by
a 17 year old one who had a dream and is
you know looking to fulfill it and I
think that's a fun part of the story to
be able to buy into and to saying that
they were here to build consumer
technology that is made by other
consumers and you know is honest yeah
obviously been one of the one of the
issues that we've been talking about
with other brands and is this something
because I know this is early days yet
for your IndieGoGo campaign but is
trying to find that kind of resonance
you know we can talk about specs and we
can talk about bang for buck and you
know the the sort of Internet fixation
with worth it or not
thumbs-up thumbs-down when we're talking
about different tech reviewers but have
you noticed any traction on the Frank
brand resonating sort of more
emotionally with potential consumers
significant yeah and we've seen a lot of
people with new marketing tactics and
we've gone through the past two months
you see a lot of people who really
really loved it and thought it was
hilarious and that thought it was
something that they could relate to just
because it was a very human
sort of thing and the person a lot of
times you're talking to on Twitter or
Instagram Facebook is the founder of the
company right we're not hiring some sort
of PR company so we we like to make that
very very personal and with that you see
a lot of people appreciate that and if
you email Frank you always get a
response very quickly people people have
really really appreciated all the little
things that we put into making sure
Frank is a very very consumer first
brand and its consumers making things
for consumers and I think that's very
very important because that's why I
started this in the first place and why
that's why the hodge started in the
first place you don't want to talk about
me talking to some bots on the phone
saying please press one foot you know
and I think that's why a lot of people
we found has really enjoyed what we've
been doing so far and it's resonated
with quite a few people and you see that
and you know just just to quickly add to
that you know we're very much aware of
the fact that you know whenever a new
phone comes out the first thing people
do is take it and say what does it
compare to every other and you start
comparing specs right you got this
thumbs-up thumbs-down and we we know
that's gonna happen we knew that was
going to happen what we wanted to shift
the story blunt control store we wanted
to say you know we thought our to
ourselves what's the worst thing that
anyone can say about our phone and it's
that it's just another phone so how can
we own that and that's part of our
marketing but at the same time allow
them to to review these facts review the
balance but give them a story to believe
in give them a brand to to buy into
because it is you know normally with
more options and we have these days
where as consumers to buy from we look
at the philosophy of companies and who
we want to support who we want to give
our honey to and you know a lot more
Millennials who were targeting are
socially conscious consumers and they're
socially conscious about whether they're
giving their money to and who they're
supporting and they're doing that and
there's been a bit you know big movement
a lot of people that have come on
support to Google said you know we're
really proud that you're Canadian really
proud that you're young guys trying to
make it I need a new phone anyway so
I'll buy it from you right so it was I
needed a new phone and I like with your
messages so it gives us an extra extra
liver uh I think that that definitely
does give you an extra liver and you
know I mean when you're so transparent
you know when you have so transparently
very young members of your crew
obviously I think that kind of breeds
some sort of them there's always going
to be that generational gap where the oh
if it's not the Millennials it's going
to be the next generation down so many
restaurants by only ordering avocado
toast like steak and lobsters all over
the place and now I can't because you
Millennials aren't buying premium
talking to a Southern California I mean
I mean the one final question I have emo
is you know to those you know to
anything that's you know like
Millennials are killing this and you're
a millennial starting up this this whole
operation here
what's your clap back to people of a
different generation who think now we've
already gotten a couple tweets saying
like why don't you just go back to your
dorm room and study somewhere instead of
trying you know what I'd like to say
that we're like a phoenix right you kill
it once it comes back and I think it'll
come back a lot stronger and that's
that's pretty much what we're trying to
do you can kill a current business model
you can kill whatever it is but as long
as we're bringing it back or making it
better I think that's that's even better
for the industry spread America and I
think what I'm trying to do even though
people are gonna be like oh go study I'm
like thank you very much that's how I
got here but I mean a lot of people
gonna be saying that and credit I don't
find it to be a bad thing that I am
young I think that's all the better so
by the time I'm their age hopefully I'll
be doing something even even bigger and
better with Frank and I think what we
can do is just take this to a whole
other level and what at the very least
what we're trying to do is get
these big companies even if people don't
want to buy our phone at the very least
if this generates enough traction we can
get them to notice and you'll have your
Samsung's in your apples all them you
have to take notice because people
people know that this is this isn't just
it's not right and you can do so much
more and so much better for so much less
well it does seem that you've got half
your wits about you and that's certainly
to be appreciated in this kind of
climate so moe Omer and fadh al-khattab

project on the phone I'm sure there are
