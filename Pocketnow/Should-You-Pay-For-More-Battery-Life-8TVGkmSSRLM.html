pocketnow.com the motorola droid razr
maxx has a battery that is far larger
than any other smartphone out there that
means that you get a ton of battery life
but you pay for it it's a hundred
dollars more on verizon wireless and
also it makes the phone a little bit
thicker but not by much does a lot more
battery life really matter well at first
I thought not really most people charge
their phone every night and it's really
not that big of a deal most smartphones
can go through the day without needing a
charge you plug it in at night you don't
think about it you pick it up in the
morning and that's it why do you need a
bigger battery why should you pay for a
bigger battery why should you have to
deal with a slightly larger thicker
phone with a bigger battery well after
using the droid razr maxx for a couple
of days got a really good answer let's
get to it so what I realized in the last
two days is that I've become so
accustomed to thinking about battery
life that it's changed my usage of a
phone on the droid razr maxx with a 3300
million power battery I no longer have
to think about battery battery life
which has changed several different
things number one live wallpaper android
gives you this ability to load live
wallpaper it's always had that ability
and it really is a cool feature that
brings some life to your home screen one
of my favorite live wallpapers is called
crazy colors as you can see it's just
kind of an explosion of colors in the
background and it absolutely destroys
mutilates battery life in fact you can
watch the battery settings and see that
the live wallpaper crazy colors will
bring down your battery life more than
anything else with such a large battery
and great battery life on the droid razr
maxx i don't have to think about live
wallpaper I just run it all the time and
I can benefit from it's a nice effect on
the home screen another thing that I've
done differently now with the larger
battery is I've changed sync settings
usually when I set up an android phone i
turn off facebook sync and Twitter sync
because i know it has an impact on
battery life and certainly data usage
although i'm near Wi-Fi a lot of the
time on the droid razr maxx facebook and
twitter are always in sync when i launch
the app everything there is ready to go
I don't have to think about battery life
I
keep sync settings as I would normally
want them other places were a lot of
battery life really impacts your usage
is with videos and games I used to play
GTA 3 on another android phone like the
Galaxy Nexus and battery life would go
down ten percent for playing just 15
minutes of the game on the droid razr
maxx with a huge battery I can play for
a couple of hours and battery life is
certainly affected ten or twenty percent
but not nearly to the extent that I
would find on another device so videos
games live wallpaper sinking and another
two areas that you really don't think
about because most people are
pre-programmed to worry about battery
life and to cut down on phone usage is
the charger I always know where my phone
chargers are because I get a little bit
of anxiety thinking of what happens if I
run out of juice on my phone what if
it's the end of the day I need to go out
i'm at zero percent how will i make a
call how will I check my email with so
much battery life I don't think about
being your charger anymore I could go
away for a couple of days and not even
bring the charger I can leave it at home
and stop thinking about having to keep
my device plugged in all the time so
there are a lot of ways that having a
bigger battery really matters and you
don't think about it that much because
we're so used to charging our phones all
the time but you can use a phone as you
wish you don't have to make compromises
and sacrifices and the cool thing about
the droid razr maxx is that the
trade-off isn't that big it's a hundred
bucks yeah that's a lot and it also adds
two millimeters of depth but you still
get a really cool android phone that's
very fast that is still quite slender in
fact thinner than most phones out there
plus it has amazing battery life so
should you pay a hundred dollars more
for a bigger battery and I say
absolutely it's worth it it changes the
way that you use your phone anyhow just
a little rant on battery life if you
like this editorial give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
