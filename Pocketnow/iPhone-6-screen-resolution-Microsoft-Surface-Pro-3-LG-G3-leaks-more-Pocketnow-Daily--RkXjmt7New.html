along with some screen specifics
additional reports claim that Microsoft
might launch a surface pro 3 next week
and according to the oneplus CEO its one
smartphone as being so that cost I'm hi
Natalie that I and I asked for motion I
mean shouldn't every company sell their
phones close to cost you know just to
grow the smartphone market this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
the official news is the 1 + co was
recently interviewed and he was asked
exactly how is it the company is
planning to make the 1+1 an affordable
phone how is it that they're doing in
according to him first reason is because
they're selling the phone at cost which
is really interesting apparently they
have this new structure that will allow
for the low cost to be in benefit of the
user but even more interesting the
company is not investing in marketing at
all it's investing only in online
marketing which we've seen in youtube
and at the same time they're only
selling this product online as well so
you actually said that that's the reason
why Samsung and Apple can't match the
price let's see about that and speaking
of flagship phones aside from the fact
that LG has begun teasing the g3 and
videos and everything in YouTube one
more interesting point is that there are
new press renders of the g3 and the
design is hot the phone looks gorgeous
seriously gorgeous and if LG did figure
out a way to make this phone a lot of
fingerprint back to like we had with the
g2 then this would definitely be a great
device obviously there's time to wait
may 27th will be the event and you bet
we'll be covering it live now another
product that might see a launch very
soon we're talking may 20th is the
Microsoft Surface many but actually the
news are not about that there is the
support document for Microsoft that the
company released and within that
document they're saying that whatever it
is that this compatible is compatible
with the surface pro 3 so the new rumor
is that probably we will be getting the
surface pro 3 at the event aside from
the service mini which makes sense if
you think about the fact that they could
revamp the surface pro 2 to the 3 and
then the surface mini would be the lower
end RT model to replace the RT surface
never sold could be a good idea let's
see how it goes now let's talk about the
iphone 6 though this product will not be
launched soon according to new rumors
the company is not allowing vacations
for employees during the month of
September's so it could be that the
iphone 6 will be launched that month
Apple does this every year they cancel
vacations on the specific launch date of
the iphone so yes that could be the case
but aside from that there are other
rumors that apparently we know what the
screen resolution will be for both
devices the 5.5 inches of 4.7 inch
models apparently this will be a 10 74 x
960 display which still doesn't invite
to any standard but does allow for the
retina display resolution to be retained
yes developers will have to update
applications but apparently this is what
we're getting probably these models are
already being tested interesting and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day those of you wondering if it's
worth it to wait for the galaxy s5 Prime
that's being rumoured apparently it is
rumors have it that the phone will be
launched next month and that it will be
worth it because it will only cost you
fifty dollars more the current galaxy s5
and you are getting better processor
better RAM and apparently other goodies
though we're still not sure if this is
actually the galaxy s5 active that's
also being rumored but that leads to the
question of the day would this make you
wait for the galaxy s5 Prime that should
be launched next month apparently
because in my particular case i don't
know if i would get either of them but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
