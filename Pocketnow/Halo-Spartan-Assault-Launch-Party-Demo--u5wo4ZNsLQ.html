we're here with a demo of the new Halo
game for Windows Phone 8
alright so hi everybody i'm kevin grace
franchise manager for 343 industries and
i will jump right in and try not to get
killed while i'm talking so this is halo
Spartan assault this is a cool new look
at the Halo universe that we've got
coming out for Windows 8 devices phones
and surfaces and PCs coming out a little
bit later this year a little little more
news on that soon but basic setup here
is anybody who's familiar with the
shooters you know that your left stick
makes you move and your right stick
helps you look around this was a little
bit different your lipstick is still
movement so around here that makes me
spin a duels cart and dance on the right
thumb the very traditional twin stick
shooter I drag this over towards the bad
guys and the bad guys go boom so grunts
go boom and I'm doing okay so far so you
know this is capitalizes on a lot of the
Jemez pick of that gun you pick up that
gun this little icon filler right here
get over that I'm gonna go ahead and not
connect to Wi-Fi right now so being able
to pick up weapons on the battlefield
weapons and grenades is a big part of
the halo combat experience that has been
a push in the shooters for literally
over a decade now and so we wanted to
make sure that we could recreate that
appropriately in a mobile form so we do
have lots of ability to grab weapons off
the battlefield and put those to work
against the Covenant you can jump in and
out of vehicles you can jump out of
there
turell's there is some ammo crates that
we're out there I'm gonna just keep
shooting while I'm going so these guys
don't blow me up so a little ammo crate
going on right there this is one of the
few kind of not really a vehicle you can
hop into but that turret there as you
saw the camera shifted out to kind of
bigger that's what happens when you are
talking too much and you let a suicide
grunt get up next to you on the turret
so we'll go ahead and jump back in here
will I keep going it's like I said you
can get in turrets you can get in
vehicles over the course of the game a
lot of things that Halo fans will be
familiar with and along with that you'll
have some very familiar sounds the
assault rifle sounds like the assault
rifle the mad
like the Magnum you know all those
things will really bring back all the
other Halo games you've played but in a
much faster much kind of higher paced
arcade style version that you can fit in
your pocket as opposed to putting an
Xbox in your pocket so it's a really
cool new take on the universe we've got
a lot of fun putting it together and
tying it into the story with Halo 4
there's some interesting unlockables in
there so if you have a Spartan in Halo 4
you'll be able to unlock some bits and
pieces for your Spartan here and well
the achievements in this game will
actually let you unlock things in Halo 4
hours yeah this is going to come also
with a full suite of achievements so you
can keep working on your gamer score
which is a good thing thank you hundred
points thanks for some more guys
I believe it's 400 but it's not like I'm
on video and you're gonna quote me about
that oh wait I guess I am so let me
double check but it's a G just got a
full ride yeah switch weapons tapping
the weapons up here lets you switch
weapons you can also just if we're
getting into controls and we find some
guys or some guys double tap on the
screen lets you throw grenades so you
can check grenades over that direction
that's in the direction that you're it's
in the variants in the direction you're
facing yeah so that one another left is
that map of open left over here is yeah
the motion tracker that's gonna just
look familiar to anybody who's played
any of the other Halo games is that way
you can know where the bad guys are
coming from so let's go back to a salt
rifle over here this is kind of trying
to make a little hand round I'm thinking
feeling better about my chances this
time we'll just call that first one a
practice round I'm sure nobody will
judge me harshly which levels having
gotten blown up
this is level C where we b1 there's
actually 25 missions in the game they're
kind of divided among five five smaller
campaigns as you're going back and forth
and playing as Sarah Palmer who like I
said was a brand new Spartan she's not a
commander at this point she's a brand
new Spartan here and her partner Spartan
Davis so look at that okay redemption
Thanks so yeah so halo Spartan assault a
little bit later this year on all
Windows 8 devices and a really cool new
look at the Halo universe excellent
they're gonna desert that's awful
scoring I'm judging myself so you guys
don't have to what kind of options and
achievements can we look at a little
cheat Mentalist the achievement list
should be out shortly
I don't know the day off that I often
top my head not in this version of the
game not in this version this is just
this one level for the demo for this
game right here yeah because our guys
back home are working furiously they get
the full game finished and out the door
so one of the other things too that I
can't show you in this version we could
take a look at under the surface is the
ability to customize your loadout as you
go into missions you can pick your
favorite weapon and use those weapons
and their armor abilities as well which
actually I should have played with here
and I did it there you can tap on the
little Spartan icon over here and it
activates the the armor ability and then
the phone gets sleepy and then will come
back and you can also set skulls which
halo fans have always like to be able to
change the way combat works to challenge
themselves and get higher scores all
those skulls in there as well alright
thank you very much my pleasure thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
