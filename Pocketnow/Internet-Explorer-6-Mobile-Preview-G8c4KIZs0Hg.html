pocketnow.com and this is a preview of
Internet Explorer 6 mobile and now you
can't get this right now but in 2009
when new Windows Mobile devices come out
they're gonna be shipping with ie6
mobile and ie6 Mobile is basically
Microsoft's answer to the question why
is Pocket Internet Explorer still so bad
so if we take a look at how pocket
Internet Explorer works right now here
is YouTube and this is what it looks
like it's completely unusable even if we
zoom out we still can't really do much
with the page and so the new version
Internet Explorer 6 has Ajax support has
support for flash so you get that
desktop like experience now right now of
course we have a lot of different
browsers that we can use with Windows
Mobile devices like Opera Mobile Skyfire
Opera Mini they give you the desktop
like browsing experience but Microsoft
ones want to say hey we've got something
too and this is what YouTube looks like
in Internet Explorer 6 pretty good right
so you can you know you can zoom out
just like you can with with other
browsers and it takes a little bit of
time the performance on this particular
version is a little slow but I expect
that when it ships it'll be faster and
if you want to get into a certain part
of the screen you have the little
selection box like you do in the current
pocket Internet Explorer and you just
kind of tap on an area on the screen it
will zoom in and like I said it supports
Flash content so if we go up to this
video and we press the play button we
should get the video
so there it is it's a little bit choppy
it's not it's not quite big
like I said when this starts to shift on
all the devices next year it'll probably
much be much better optimized for for
the device and be much smoother so let's
take a look at some web pages and how
they render in ie6 so let's do let's do
cnet.com and also in Internet Explorer 6
we get this autosuggest box at the top
which saves you a little bit of time not
having to type comm and that sort of
thing alright and here is seen it and
that took quite a bit of time and like I
said it looks like your your desktop for
some reason some Flash content doesn't
load but again I think that's just
because this is an early version and not
exactly what it's going to be shipping
and basically the rest of the program is
reminiscent of the original pocket
internet explorer so you go into menu
you get the you know a simple interface
if you go to view you can choose whether
you see the mobile or the desktop
version so it's convenient to have that
right there we can go into full screen
and it takes a second and here we are
and we get out of full screen so
basically it's like Pocket Internet
Explorer but with the engine of Internet
Explorer 6 so that is it for the preview
of ie6 Mobile will reserve full judgment
until the final version comes out on
devices next year because this version
is kind of buggy and slow and I think
it's not representative of what we will
see in in the next year and for now we
can stick to Skyfire and opera mobile
which are really really great browsers
so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
