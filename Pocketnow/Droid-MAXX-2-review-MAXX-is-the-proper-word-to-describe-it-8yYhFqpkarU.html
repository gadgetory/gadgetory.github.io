was making waves motorola came up with a
similar phone that could be sold outside
the Verizon ecosystem they called it the
Moto Maxx this year Verizon picked up
the Droid turbo - but to make sure those
without deep pockets still had a
respectable droid branded phone to
choose from
Verizon's offering a second one how does
it stack up to the other phones and is
it worthy of the droid name I'm Joe
Levite with Verizon's Droid Maxx - this
is PocketNow when asked about the naming
of the Droid Maxx - motorola CEO said it
stands for max battery max megapixels
and max value we'll see about that
the silver ring around the phone isn't
really metal it's just painted
polycarbonate but it still looks pretty
snazzy the backplate is removable though
the battery beneath it isn't that means
you'll be able to change out your back
cover to suit your whimsy but there's
nothing you can get to underneath it
even the nano SIM and the micro SD card
are in a tray at the top of the phone
not under the cover the SD slot is
something we really like it can take
your 16 gig on-board storage and
supplement it with cards up to 128 gig
sold separately of course the Droid Maxx
- is basically a rebranded Moto X pure
edition in terms of size it curves from
about 6 millimeters thick on the edges
to 10 millimeters around back that
curved as with other Moto's before it
fits nicely in the hand though with a
removable back panel feels a little
flimsy at times it's solid and
substantial all without being heavy
just like other Moto's in the family the
center line dimple is a comfortable
anchor point for your fingertip alas
that solid is there's no fingerprint
scanner hiding beneath it unlike the
droid turbo 2
there's no ugly carrier logo polluting
the front you'll find that around back
but that's a much more acceptable
location the screen is LCD not AMOLED
it's topped with Gorilla Glass 3
not the shattered shields screen that
the turbo 2 gets don't try stepping on
this phone with a horse or anything
crazy like that bezels are minimal and
the screen looks nice the power button
is on the left side and is ridged to
help you find it easily with the volume
rocker just beneath it the max2 has a
microUSB port on the bottom capable of
turbo charging which is a good thing but
it includes wireless charging as well
while we'd have loved to see a
Snapdragon 810 under the hood the 1.7
gigahertz octa-core 615 will suffice and
it's a bit nicer when it comes to
battery life the software is a Motorola
5 version of android 5.1.1 lollipop it
comes with most but not all of the added
features Moto's are famous for the
camera on the Droid Maxx too is pretty
decent with 21 megapixels and an F 2.0
aperture phase detector focused dual LED
flash and very capable HDR modes for
both Stills and video yeah we were
impressed with how well pictures turned
out and know the camera itself isn't all
that great but for a mid-range phone
it's not half bad overall performance
with the max2 was perfectly acceptable
and on par with what we experienced with
similarly SPECT phones like the Nexus 5
the Snapdragon 615 processor can get
bogged down at times but only very
occasionally in our experience we
weren't able to try out the advanced
calling features like HD voice and video
calling that the phone and the verizon
network offer but traditional phone
calls were great LTE speeds around the
pocket now you two offices were pretty
decent it's got a 3630 milliamp hour
battery that verizon claims will keep
you powered up for 48 hours in our
experience with moderate to heavy use
the battery will get you through at
least a day and a half after more than
24 hours on our current charge we're
still at 30% battery remaining an
estimated 18 hours and 10% of that has
been with the screen on
the Droid Maxx too isn't a flagship and
it's not going to win any competitions
against them however it is a very viable
mid-range phone that performs right
where we'd expect it to it feels nice
that performs well and it lasts at least
all day and all night
if you're a Verizon customer and the
droid turbo just isn't for you for the
retail price of three hundred eighty
four dollars or sixteen bucks a month
the Droid Maxx too is the next in line
