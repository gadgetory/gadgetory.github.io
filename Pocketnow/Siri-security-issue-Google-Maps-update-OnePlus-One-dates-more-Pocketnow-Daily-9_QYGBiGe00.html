allow anyone to access your contacts
through Siri Google's new update to map
springs you laying suggestions and other
services and the oneplus one keeps
failing in its scheduled promise but
this time for a good reason I'm high
netting that I and if this green screen
could talk which is blue for you guys
it'll tell you how much I need coffee
right now this is out daily
let's begin today with the official news
as Google has just brought us a new
update to maps and it's really cool
aside from some integration with other
services link to this refer for a full
list of everything you get probably the
cool is what is the fact that now Google
will tell you which is the best lay you
should take in order to avoid traffic as
we know that there are lanes that are
less crowded than others so it's really
cool the update is free it'll be
available to everybody soon as we know
how Google rolls updates and let us know
what you think of the comments down
below another official news the 1 + 1 64
gigabyte variant will not be launched in
June which is when the company promised
but this time for a good reason the
company has just noticed that everybody
wants the 64 gig variant and nobody
wants the 16 gig so what the company is
doing is actually switching things
they're making the 64 gig variant
available in may and the 16 gig variant
available in june but obviously the
biggest problem here is it's still
invitation-only sadly so stay tuned for
that let's go through some rumors
specifically HTC as we heard a couple of
days ago that the company was working on
an HTC One m8 prime paint these names my
god but anyways apparently the company
was gonna bring us a much better version
of the HTC One and we've got a lot of
rumors like a Snapdragon 805 we've got a
rumor of a 2k display on this phone and
apparently the launch will be September
now the biggest problem is that the only
thing that was not rumoured here is
changes to the camera we are hoping that
the company brings as an eighth
ultrapixel camera that would be the
perfect thing but you don't know what to
make of it let's see what we get now
let's talk about Apple specifically iOS
7.1 point one as there is this very
interesting security bug that was
detected by sharp resin which is famous
for jailbreaking phones from years ago
from you know the whole dev team and
everything and the guy
notice that there is a walk around for
you to actually be able to access your
contacts and pretty much interact with
everything you want with them it just
using Siri and I'm talking about the
times when your phone has a password
lock so watch out for this if you want
to keep your address book a secret we
don't know of Apple will update iOS 7.1
point 1 since we know that iOS 8 is
scheduled for is rumored for WWDC in the
next couple of weeks so let's see how
that goes and finally for the dramatic
news of the day get this we know that
Apple has been using this bogus company
to register the iWatch trademark in a
lot of countries and I don't know if you
knew this because it's extremely
horrible but swatch had this watch
that's called the ice watch and it's not
a SmartWatch but because of its name
swatches just decided that it will start
registering the trademark i watch and
all the countries where it sells the ice
watch because they want to avoid
confusion from people and these are two
very different products I mean the ice
watch is probably one of the ugliest
things I've seen in my life and I just
watches things but anyways that link you
to the question of the day if Apple
didn't use the name iWatch what other
name do you think the company could use
for this I mean give us a suggestion as
to what other name do you think Apple
could use for the iWatch in my
particular case let's just call the
thing I clock I don't care just give us
a wearable that's actually worth it but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think in front you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
