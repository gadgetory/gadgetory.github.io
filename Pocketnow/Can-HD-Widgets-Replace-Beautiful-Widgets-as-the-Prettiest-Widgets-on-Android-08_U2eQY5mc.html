to give you more information on your
Android display whether that's your
smartphone or your tablet I've got just
the thing let's go take a look we've
shown off beautiful widgets in the past
and it's well just like its name implies
it's quite beautiful has a lot of themes
that you can get for door skins that are
made by all kinds of people you can even
submit them if you want to build your
own and even have ways to donate money
however isn't there something else well
yes there is it's called HD widgets and
really it's saving grace is the fact
that it's so high definition it's very
very pretty there are lots of different
settings that you can use although not
necessarily skins like you may be
familiar with with some of the other
widget packs so what we've got here this
is my galaxy nexus running jellybean
this this widget is really optimized for
ice cream sandwich based systems in fact
the recommendations are that you're
running a 1.2 dual core system a really
high-end specs however I've had it run
just fine on other phones as well so
let's go ahead and take a look at it
this is what I call the the main icon
this is what you want to have on your
screen it's a widget that has well the
kitchen sink it's got your clock it's
got your current weather got the current
temperature the expected high and low
and what the the weather is expected to
be like in my case sunny 97 degrees if
it only gets up to 97 today i will be
happy it was quite a bit hotter than
that yesterday it's got the the day of
the date and of course the city so that
you make sure that something didn't
happen to your gps that thinks that
you're someplace that you're not which
does occasionally happen and then you
get you know forecast for a different
area over here you can see the forecast
widget does exactly what you'd expect it
to do this is the three-day forecast
they do have a five day as well and then
over here are some examples of the
toggles and the to buy ones so i can
turn my Wi-Fi on and off you can look at
my battery status right there don't know
why it has an
an off feature on that because I really
don't want to turn my battery off just
curious about that a very small widget
to tell you the essentially what the
weather's like if you want to have a
smaller more compact one lots of
different clock styles that you can
choose from so how do you get this to
work if you're using ice cream sandwich
you want to open your app drawer and go
over to widgets from there you've got a
whole bunch of widgets to choose from
with the caveat the first time you
install this it may take a little bit of
time for the widgets to show up if you
want to speed that up just restart your
phone work just fine this took about
eight minutes before it updated on my
phone some people in the market have
complained that there aren't any widgets
to choose from well you got to run in
the app first and then the widget show
up in a little while just a little tip
for you there so you'll notice there
aren't a lot of widgets to choose from
there's only five at least on this phone
because it's got this display on tablets
which I'll get to in just a minute there
a couple others and they're really kind
of neat so let's say you want to do to
buy one because I had a whole bunch of
those on there we could you know what
let's choose a four by four cuz i
already showed you that one we tap and
hold obviously i can't drop it there so
let's try and find a screen that i have
room on to drop it i dont have space
anywhere so we're just going to put it
right there next to my facebook the
first thing that it goes into now is
your selector what kind of widget do you
want this to be well i can either do a
full screen four by four like this or I
can do weather like that whichever one I
want one with see if I can tap one with
the the time and one without let's go
ahead and do it without the next thing
that I get to choose from is my
background and they've got all these
different types right here with a live
preview of what it's going to look like
I kind of like really transparent stuff
so I've been choosing this one down here
of course if I want to I can just hit
something random and it'll pick
something at random let's go ahead and
come back and select what I want once
you've got it selected you've got what
you want picked
hit the check mark and that will drop it
right onto the screen and have your
widget added successfully very very nice
now if you're running Ice Cream Sandwich
and you've got extra stuff on the screen
it will scooch it up and resize it so
that it will make room and fit so you
can go back in and and make changes you
can also change this up obviously that
doesn't look very good but you can
resize this to your heart's content
really kind of nice go ahead and say ok
on that we're good lots of different
things you can do lots of styles the
stuff you can do with it is almost
endless let's see what it looks like on
a tablet now remember I told you that it
wanted ice cream sandwich or above well
that's the case however it will run on
Android at 2.2 and above this is
honeycomb this is my samsung galaxy tab
77 and you can kind of see here what
I've done there are some other widget
options that you can choose from on
honeycomb and below to add a widget
press and hold choose widgets same thing
goes here you'll want to make sure that
you watch the app and wait for a little
while before these widgets tiles show up
on a tablet you've got some other
options in addition to the four-by-four
a full screen that I showed you on the
phone you've got a four by seven half
page which is really optimized for
10-inch tablets eight by one small
header and an eight by two large header
let's go ahead and select that one again
it takes you in here to the chooser and
let's see if we can find that same
really transparent when there we go we
can change our clocks tile let's try
that one you know what let's try this is
honeycomb let's do the honeycomb clock
there we go we can change the clock
background we don't like that we can
choose something else however we want it
to look feel like Bob Ross a little
pretty little tree right there there you
go can change the clock color let's make
it something weird the clock color too
because this has two different
dimensions to it go ahead and do that
that looks good and then a sidebar
whatever we want over here we can either
have our
or we can have our weather let's go
ahead and do toggles and that brings up
some options here where we can pick our
switches let's just pick one at random
pick that one and then we can change our
switch color because that green doesn't
really match with our color scheme here
so there we go let's choose that one hit
the check mark says save and now right
there not at the top so let's put it at
the top we've got our widget edit looks
beautiful nice high definition when we
rotate it things are going to get a
little bit more compact western auto
rotation on it compacts things up quite
a bit but even still it looks really
really nice just docked to the top of
the screen so that's HD widgets a little
bit more detail than you'd normally
expect just to show off widgets but
there's a lot more things that you can
see and do with this then well what we
could cover in a very short video let us
know what you think is this going to
unseat beautiful widgets as the reigning
king of the the widgets on Android or
does it still need room to grow as far
as skins go this has only got one this
is the HD tablet skins but there are
going to be more coming soon that you
can get right from the app itself if you
like this video might seeing this in
this level of detail make sure you give
the video a big thumbs up you've got
questions or comments head over to
pocketnow.com and leave those down at
the bottom of the article where we will
be standing by to help out along with
everybody else who's watching and has
recommendations and suggestions for you
for pocket now thrown off cool widgets
