pocket now for those of you that don't
know me I'm going to be making videos
for pocket now on a regular basis now
and those for those of you that do know
me from doing videos in the past hello
again I'm I'm back and I'm going to be
doing videos and hopefully you like them
there's a bunch of things I want to talk
about on video going forward for example
a lot of people are talking about the
notch on phones and how we're trying to
get to this future where we have a high
screen to body ratio with no notch it's
the dream there's no there's no blocking
of the screen it's just a large screen
in your hands with minimum bezels well I
want to talk about the notch and why I
think it's one of the most important
smartphone design elements to come
around in a very long time and why we
should actually embrace the knotch and
why there are some problems with the
bezel this displays like you get on the
vivo necks or the Oppo find X another
thing I want to talk about in the future
video is how to have a new phone almost
all the time at minimum cost by buying
and selling at the exact right time
there's kind of an ebb and flow to smart
to phone cycles and the values have
flown the phones fluctuate so frequently
and there's a method that you can use to
be able to buy and sell phones on a
regular basis and basically have one of
the newest phones at all times at a very
minimum cost of course I'm going to be
doing unboxings and reviews because
those are all those are always really
fun and another thing is I have phones
that are 5 10 15 years old and I think
they're kind of interesting because they
let us see kind of how we got to where
we are today so I'm gonna go down memory
lane talk about the Palm Pre and the
Motorola q9 age and the HTC Titan and a
lot of those old-school devices that
many of us have forgotten about but
there's actually a lot to be learned
from these devices from the past so I'm
going to be doing videos for pocket now
again I'm super excited and I hope you
guys are too and I hope you like the
videos that I make that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
