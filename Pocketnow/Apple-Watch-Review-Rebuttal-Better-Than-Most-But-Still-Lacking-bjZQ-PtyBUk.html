sales figures but you and I know that
sales aren't everything
the biggest question is if this really
is the best product in its category and
worth the extra Apple tax I'm Jaime
meadow with PocketNow and join us for
our second look at the Apple watch
here at pocket now we are fond of
reviewer bundles mainly because the
needs of one editor very different to
the needs of others Michels review has
been live for the last few weeks but he
likes to wear plaid and shorts and I'm
still the oddball that wears a polo and
tucks it inside his jeans I'm
particularly very picky about watches
mainly because I have to actually like
one in order to be willing to use it or
let alone buy it so it's only fair that
I clarify that when deciding what Smart
Watch to buy a few months ago I jumped
the gun for a stainless steel moto 360
not the Apple watch part of my decision
have to do with the price versus looks
of the Apple watch don't get me wrong
but the 7000 series aluminum match with
the poly astron on the watch band do
feel top-notch and the flexible OLED
display looks far better than most of
its competitors but the design around
that doesn't really stand out and that's
really what jewelry is all about in my
opinion you really have to like a watch
in order to be willing to pay twice the
amount of competing products and that's
not the case here this 42 millimeter
variant feels small in my very large
wrist and it's round corner design only
reminds me of a Casio watch from the 90s
the only cool part of its design is that
swapping bands for it is very practical
so long as you don't pay the Apple tax
for them thankfully Amazon is full of
third-party options and while not Apple
approved as of yet they do change things
dramatically for around $30 once you've
got the looks figured out then things
start to ease in and that's very
important since using the Apple watch is
actually where you notice where the
price different is see there is a
substantial difference in using the
Apple watch to any other SmartWatch the
UI is clearly an example giving users
different selections of watch phases
that you can customize with your
particular needs
high-value Fitness activity weather
information and battery life and this
chronograph phase is the one that most
appeals to me when it comes to visuals
though you can do this with every other
watch phase yes you don't get any
options for third
watch phases but I'll take it for the
added functionality glances at the
bottom are also useful for controlling
things that actually matter to you and
the cool thing is you can actually
remove them if you want to and
notifications sliding from the top are
also gestures that you're used to the
company's emphases on third-party
applications is also noticeable with the
hidden app tray and installing these
compatible applications is very simple
and straight forward through the iOS
application the software also has some
cool little tricks up its sleeve taking
off the watch locks it immediately and
very consistently as an added security
bonus and you also get activation lock
features with watch OS 2 so you don't
have to worry about somebody stealing
your watch you'll also notice that it
it's extremely reliable at detecting
when you raise your wrist and when
that's done as well the taptic engine
Milton also does a reliable job at
keeping you alerted in the very subtle
way and the Bell tones used on the watch
are also something pleasant overall
there's no denying that the Apple watch
does far more than its competitors but
everything more isn't necessarily a good
thing
see I joined Michael and his thoughts
that using the Apple watch can tend to
feel convoluted due to its user
interface for starters the digital crown
is nice to have but confusing at its
operation strolling around things is
nice but not being able to press the
button to select something as awkward
you have to press the screen you think
that Apple would be smart enough to use
the other button to go home but no it's
misused through contacts or such
technology is also very cool to have but
you either never know when the options
available or you're probably not
pressing the display hard enough this is
more of a learning curve though that's
worth getting used to because there are
things that this watch does right
Fitness is a major example I find myself
going back to the Apple watch all the
time mainly because it does Fitness
better than any other modern wearable
built by a smartphone OEM instead of
being an extension of your phone you can
actually go for a run or for a bike ride
with the Apple watch or you can even use
it for internal workouts without needing
to bring the iPhone which is a major
benefit particularly if you use an
iPhone six-plus the heart rate sensor is
fully active during the time that you
confirm that your training and its
results are rather accurate not
necessarily because you care about your
heart rate but really because you want
an accurate calculation of your calories
and that's something that's an added
benefit of the Apple watch the watch
also does a good job at calculating your
calories while you move every 10 minutes
and it reminds you to stand every hour
which is great surely this is no Garmin
for those professionals out there that
want something extremely accurate with
GPS functionality and everything but if
you're getting started in the fitness
world I would highly recommend this
watch if you're concerned about battery
life with all this fitness activity well
I'd say it depends if you trained for
more than an hour or two then you'll
probably finish the day with one charge
but if you don't train at all you'll
notice the Apple watch will last for
more than a day if you train for more
than that and yeah they'll probably only
get half a day then there are the other
things that the Apple watch does almost
right like for example phone calls I
hate the fact that an Android where you
get notifications of a call but you
can't really take it in the Apple watch
you actually can take the call the
problem is the speaker is terrible so
again it's cool to have the option here
I also wish Siri would use the speaker
to respond to me whenever I call on it
but I guess nothing's perfect then there
are the gimmicks like sending taps to a
friend or the current state of Apple
watch applications which are slower to
launch on the watch than on the phone
making you not really use these things
they are things that are nice to have
but things that you would rarely call
upon until Apple figures these things
out and hopefully that happens with
watch OS 2 most of these gimmicks are
really good ideas but they do lack the
maturity needed for users to want to go
back to them and I guess that's the best
way to describe my last couple of weeks
with the Apple watch this is a very very
good idea that could benefit from a less
convoluted UI
and more mature design options I
personally find it very hard to stop
using it because it really does Fitness
better than any other SmartWatch but
your priority should determine if this
alone is enough to warrant the big price
tag for all it can do I do see myself
stretching my pocket for a sports bottle
like this one and having it out for a
nap but I wouldn't spend the dime until
the Apple watch 2 comes out and figures
the rest of the things out and if you're
still on the ropes trying to consider if
the Apple watch is right for you I would
probably use this same mentality as well
folks again this is our second look at
the Apple watch so be sure to watch
