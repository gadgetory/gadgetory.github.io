launching Android wear on iOS we get
significant leaks of the new Moto 360
and even the Moto 360 sport it could it
be that the blackberry Venice will
actually happen and look this hot I'm hi
meri beta and this seemed like if it's
time for me to place this old moto 360
on ebay bids anybody this is parking out
daily the official news today are going
to have to wait we're pretty much stuck
with rumors right now is we're just a
couple of hours away from Aoife to begin
so sony make the big splash today we had
a link to video the video is pulled
where we saw three devices coming the
Xperia z5 premium with an
ultra-high-resolution 4k display and
then we have a your typical z5 and z5
compact with the regular specs that we
had already talked about we had talked
about the possibility of a 4k display on
a sony smartphone we just didn't think
it was going to happen so early stay
tuned we'll probably learn more in the
next couple of hours other rumors that
we are expecting to happen in the next
few hours is the new Moto 360 but we
have learned that there were two
variants a smaller and a larger one
which we actually have renders for today
and yes it looks gorgeous but even more
interesting is that we also have leaked
renders of a moto 360 sport so yeah
apparently there are three models coming
very soon and you bet some of us can't
really wait and even though we thought
were done with the round of
announcements for motorola smartphones
we've got some leaked renders of the
motorola bounce from a very trusted
source and well as it turns out this
phone actually has better specifications
than the Moto X in certain areas like
for example in the processor so even
though we don't think that this product
will be announced at Aoife we will be
looking forward to something new coming
soon now the vice we thought we would
not see it all and we were recently
surprised is the blackberry Venice I
mean yeah a blackberry phone running
android is a great idea but once you see
the phone leaked in photos you get to
see that this thing is gorgeous it is a
very thin device with a slide-out
keyboard a keyboard
that keeps the whole blackberry
perspective on stock Android this could
just be a prototype in so many ways and
we know companies that give these things
a try but my god if this phone does
launch later this year it might be a hit
and finally the hot news of the day are
actually the only official ones google
has just launched Android wear for iOS
means you can actually connect your
Android wear SmartWatch to your iPhone
but there's a catch Google is only
announcing this for devices like watch
urbane the new huawei watch and the
suzanne watch to which are the newer
ones seems that the older ones can't
connect but users have claimed that they
have part we said that they're smart
watch and then eventually it works so
that could be an option just stay tuned
as we learn more but obviously it does
lead me to the question of the day if
you're currently running an iphone would
you want to buy an android wear
SmartWatch after this or vice versa if
you have an Android wear SmartWatch what
you want to buy an iphone now because in
my case you can bet i'm going to give
this a try but leave us a comment down
below what are you planning to do
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get the nose earlier before
this video was filmed be sure you follow
us on parking our comment subscribe to
our youtube channel as well it followed

better on instagram at hi natalie better
