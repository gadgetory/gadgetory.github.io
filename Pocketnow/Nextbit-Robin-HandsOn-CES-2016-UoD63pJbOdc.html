of design prowess with automated cloud
computing and an unlocked friendly
mindset you get the next bit Robin I'm
hi Otto Hugh's been reporting for Pocket
now at CES 2016 let's take a look I know
we already saw the Robin last year but
the version we saw today was a much more
finished product than what we had demo
before in fact it's the version that
will ship out to next bits Kickstarter
backers on February 16th next Fitz whole
philosophy in creating the Robin is to
eliminate the need to ever manage your
storage when it notices that you're
running out of space it does an online
archive of your least use apps and
leaves only shadow icons in their place
when the orange hits you to give that
app another shot just touch its icon and
the Robin starts redownload it and it
even applies your credentials store
locally of course so you don't have to
sign back in you can even pin certain
apps to make sure they never get
offloaded to the cloud though you can't
manually archive apps in the same manner
it'll take a little while for most users
to fill it up too it's got 32 gigabytes
of internal storage and next fit offers
a hundred gigabytes in the cloud for
your apps and photos we've been told
video support is following closely
behind one of the Robins biggest
bragging rights is in its open nature
the phone is unlocked right out of the
box and next bit promise is an
unlockable bootloader that won't void
your warranty you can flash CyanogenMod
to your heart's content though be
mindful in doing so you're losing all
the Robins best features the cloud
operations are built deeply into the
core OS and even installing a new
launcher like the Google now launcher
will lead to some loss of finesse like
losing the progress bar when restoring
archived apps glancing for even a split
second at the Robin it's easy to come to
the conclusion that this is no
run-of-the-mill smartphone design next
bits design team wanted to break away
from the rounded corners and derivative
aesthetics that cast all of their
smartphones into monotony the circle
motif found throughout most of the
accents on the phone and the square off
corners care to the Preferences of the
designers themselves and stand as a
testament to the phones
interesting physique
once the Robin reaches its official
launch you'll be able to pick one up for
399 in either mint or midnight finishes
or if you're one of the 3600 who
pre-ordered a unit you can even snag the
Kickstarter exclusive electric variant a
personal favorite of ours will
undoubtedly have much more coverage on
the next bit Robin once a review unit
hits our doors pocket now CES 2016
