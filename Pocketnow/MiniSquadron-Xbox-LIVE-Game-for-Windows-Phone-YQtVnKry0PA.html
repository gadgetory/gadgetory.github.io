and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out okay this week we've
got minisquadron for xbox live on
Windows Phone and this is a
two-dimensional flying game we have a
little airplane that we choose and you
can unlock off those are airplanes so
here we are turn down a little bit and
let's do my squadron has a noon airplane
that I just unlocked I have all sorts of
choices so let's see i'm going to try
that one it's barney and let's play
classic mode is you shoot down other
airplanes and you unlock all the levels
and progress the level survival mode
will just keep going until you die so
let's do this one choose my airplane and
here there's going to be a joystick
right here so i can change my direction
there's my gun and we fly around and we
shoot the other planes oh and they have
all sorts of different weapons right i
get this guy up
so we gotta and I'm stalling so I gotta
catch my oh there we go where's the
other guy there's one plane left there
we go i think we've got them oh now one
thing you got to watch out for is when
it's got big messages on screen about a
new level you're still flying so you
might crash even when it's in between
levels and you know there's little level
power-ups there you can get that one and
sometimes a hard will be flying around
you can get a little life and I'm going
to crash soon I think there we go
go some more of these airplanes and I
really like the music there's some nice
classical music in the background okay I
can't stop playing so much fun all right
of course you got the achievements the
leaderboards and some options nothing
big they're just music and lots of the
achievements to get so a really fun game
I like it a lot if you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up and that's it
for now
