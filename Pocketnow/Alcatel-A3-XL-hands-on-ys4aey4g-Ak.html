new blackberry CC Elkins it used to give
its primary brand to Alcatel new
products to reach broader markets I'm
having to be better with pocket now here
with high auto Houston on the edits and
this is the Alcatel a3 XL rocket I'll be
idle is all about the premium mid-range
and now the a3 Excel shows us a very
interesting approach to the entry level
market for starters specifications like
a six inch 720p display one gigabyte of
RAM yeah just one a gigabytes of storage
eight and five megapixel cameras in the
back and front an immediate sec
processor are nothing to be excited
about what makes this phone sort of
special is that the design language is
not entirely forgettable thanks to its
textured back and the fact that the
phone actually doesn't feel bad in the
hand there's also a 3000 milliamp hour
battery included and yeah there's also a
fingerprint scanner in tow at the back
something that's really hard to find for
this price range and something that's
rather interesting as the companies
approach to remove the SIM card trays
just by pushing into the hardware
Android 7.0 nougat is powering the show
on a very light skin provided by Alcatel
though obviously don't expect this to
win any benchmarks something fair given
the fact that this phone is really not
targeted to any other than the
entry-level market pricing and
availability is still not available but
we do hear that the a3 XL will be priced
aggressively we'll report back as we
learn more about markets as it won't be
available in the United States initially
