episode three three one of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now oh and xD
developers recorded on Friday the 9th of
November 2018 beating peak Apple to the
departure of the neck sigh you've got
plenty to unfold this week so let's get
right to it
joshan the crew are on assignment this
week so i'm here i'm jules wong i'm glad
to have an old friend back on its TK Bay
Good Friday to you Good Friday to you to
my friend nice to see you again and yeah
you know I love hanging out with you you
know nice Friday afternoon sunny windy
where I am but you know it's nice it's
nice to see your face again trying to
avoid the fires up in Ventura County so
no luckily no we're about 30 minutes or
so away from them but we can definitely
see the plume of smoke and the air the
quality of the air it does get affected
so they pretty much recommend us staying
home today yeah we're doing well doing
fine at least keep a thought out for
those people up there and joining us for
the first time to spin her gears is geek
spin zone Elena stone it's been this has
been overdue Elena come on welcome it I
mean it's what took so long
come on I don't know I don't know what
happens I'm glad that we were able to
have you on this week and for further
weeks as we go on I hope to have you on
a our big CES show because we're all
going to be there
we're just gonna have like a room full
of people and then just one camera and
we're just gonna pack you in and it's
just gonna be great it's actually not
going to be great because we know what
happens that's a yes we're gonna get
sick just like a couple of us are right
now and then we're going to have to like
work through it and try and get as many
60-second hands-on videos done with our
voices all kind of and you're trying
your best and you have to keep recording
three times over because you flubbed
this line or that line it's great
nothing like the nerves Lou theraflu
robitussin mind drinks of choice over
there yeah in any case we have lots to
get through we do want to get your
feedback on it you at listener or you
viewer in any case so be sure to tweet
at us
hashtag P and weekly so that we are able
to track down what you're saying in
real-time as I try and reach for my
phone that could be on this side or
could be on my right side it could be
here yes that's right all right I'll
keep track of that as we go along and
talk about our first story here so what
is the measure of success for Apple at
this point because we are going into a
holiday season where Apple has decided
that it will no longer give out unit
sales numbers in its quarterly earnings
and this is on top of a kind of mediocre
forecast for revenues where the street
has been expecting what 93 billions and
some numbers that we can't even
comprehend because we're just mere
mortals and then apples like well we're
aiming for like 91 billion dish so what
does the picture look like going forward
what does does it mean more sales in a
market where iPhones have saturated the
US and maybe have reached as far as
they're going to go in most of the
developed markets or is the price game
going to be next is the what's next
Helena well I think in general this
strategy was really smart on our part
know that there's it's most likely
impossible for them to beat their
previous numbers right and if they don't
show gross right they'll grow some
numbers that looks bad when all these
other Chinese players are beating them
um but ultimately I don't think that
it's a bad sign for the company because
they are still making lots of money
right and there's they seem to be
compensating by making their handsets
more expensive they're compensating in
so many different ways but I get why
they don't want to really move on to
release those numbers and makes absolute
sense yeah I mean well it's I don't
really I mean everything market is kind
of started to react a little bit to this
whole alright we're seeing four digits
now and I'm a little bit scared I'm not
looking forward to paying $40 a month on
my cellular bill in addition to the
cellular service that I'm going to have
I think we're getting there I want to be
surprised if they end up being that
those numbers at the end of placing
their numbers so I feel oh this is like
a safe way for them to play it hey we're
not gonna release the numbers and if
somehow they feed the numbers they I bet
they'll sure that perhaps perhaps maybe
beat last year's number they just don't
have to be specific yeah exactly yeah
yeah and well it was considering that
Samsung and Huawei which are still kind
of building their reputations on those
numbers world's most most popular
smartphone brand by shipments like about
that kind of thing I'm wondering what
the picture is for you at DK um for me
you know Apple has been I mean we
they're in them they're in the media for
other things as well I mean we'll get a
chance to talk a little bit more about
them in that aspect but as far as the
numbers like Elena said I think
realistically not having to share the
numbers just gives them the ability to
just not have to worry about have any
answer those questions every time the
you know quarterly reports come out but
the short answer is they're going to
still be measured by how many shipments
how many how many stores are sold out
how much the wait times and people will
still talk about them and I think that
will help their stock kind of survive
that in the long run in the near term
this is just a like a minimal dip most
people are reacting to the white
you don't you want to share and then
something will take over but the reality
at the end of the day when you look at
the actual product sales and the
innovative well not innovation you know
numbers new laptops do you know the mini
the new air the new iPhones all of those
things taking the price out of it I
think makes them just trying to you know
feed into that high life you know ticket
people are buying into the brand no
longer worrying about the number that I
think that's really what it is and
hopefully that could translate into more
sales for them and just not having to
worry about competing with themselves
now since they're so far had some other
people they don't have to actually
compete so we're going to the world of
theory here what if they decide to
reinstate those reports perhaps just
because of a turning point like maybe
it's oh this iPhone 10s s ra p GES is
I'm very sorry what if that has like
though for some reason done 20% better
than ever or something like that like do
you think it's a move that Apple will
kind of do or what oh I'm I'm pretty
sure it will be like the first slide
they put up when they on the next
keynote for the next iPhone though
they'll boost the numbers they'll refer
to percentages I think it's just not
having to give up specifics I think
that's really what they're shooting for
they just want to be able to just say
look we we are doing good we're still
producing the same amount of you know
new devices were selling them I think
they just you don't want to take out the
the question of numbers just from the
reporting it doesn't mean that you know
you still can't see how they're
performing and it just it's in the long
run better for them not to have to say
you know this is how much we made on the
iPhone 10 and this is how much we made
on the iPhone 10s it's just a number
anything right because at the end of the
day people are still buying the iPhone
tennis XR / - all that good stuff yeah
yeah and Hellena what do you think about
u-turn if there is any down the road
what was that I didn't hear that so what
do you think about u-turn if there are
any u-turns to be had down the road in
terms of reporting at these numbers oh
yeah I mean I I said it before I
wouldn't be surprised that if they do be
there the numbers that they'll go
ahead and and and share those numbers I
feel like that's very Apple like as I'm
in general just like a little line quote
in the press release or something like
that exactly yeah yeah well we'll see
about that it's gonna be interesting to
see how Apple judges itself and in
reflection how we investors and
customers judge Apple as we move forward
here but in the meantime we have plenty
to talk about related to Apple sort of
relate to Apple and this is talking
about Qualcomm to which it continues on
the legal sparring continues on it all
starting with Qualcomm being accused of
a very anti-competitive hate behavior in
terms of working its own clients to not
use any other chipsets from their
competitors and it's blown up to this
massive war between Apple and Qualcomm
and for the longest time we've heard
Qualcomm sand give all these platitudes
and saying that Apple is still a valued
customer is still a valued partner and
we look forward to continuing this
relationship with them and between all
the sales injunction requests for
iPhones and other things that perhaps we
haven't seen yet Apple a source to
Reuters from the Apple side has said
that they are not negotiating with
Qualcomm at any level quote there is
absolutely no meaningful discussion
between us and Qualcomm and there is no
settlement insane and when you think
about how much of an impact how much
presence Qualcomm has in our industry
and what you know to titans Apple being
one of the most profitable companies in
the world and being able to perhaps ask
for damages that might be worth more
than Qualcomm is as a company what do
you think abouts this hold this
stalemate at this point TK what do you
think about what happens here does Apple
have more of a chance of winning than
Qualcomm or what
I think this the seriousness of the way
Apple is playing it right now is it's
very big like I'm the Big Kahuna in the
room right now and you need to pay
attention to me and they do obviously
command a very large presence in the
market Qualcomm can't really just shun
them and say well you know we're not
gonna talk to you guys but again if we
keep in mind historically performances
as far as radio performance on you know
on iPhones and stuff and such devices
have never been at the same level as
some of the other devices that we've
seen on the market I think this is
pretty much just for the better for
worse I think this is just a negotiation
ploy they need to basically try to make
their presents town and Qualcomm come to
the table as the understanding of you
understood the big guys and you really
need to give us what we need because at
the end of the day of course apple also
has historically done this where they've
gone with their own chipset I mean they
have their own main chip sat in the SOC
so reliant on Qualcomm could potentially
not be an issue for them if they decide
to venture into you know dumping into
that if they do want to do that I think
it's really something that Qualcomm
needs to pay attention for it and should
not you know they shouldn't basically go
in there thinking well you know they
need to answer to us I think it's the
other way around
Apple has has a really good presence
here well in terms of making their own
components I think it's kind of
interesting to think about how what
Qualcomm is accusations against apples
that it helped Intel one of the
competing and chip the modem makers with
copying consumer Qualcomm proprietary
code and helping them out in that aspect
so that's interesting
Hellena what's your take on this whole
conflict well I definitely can't follow
who's wrong or who's right in all this
it's super confusing but I get why
apples kind of being very steadfast they
don't need to follow them right now
they're making great chips so they
certainly don't need them and I
certainly have the the lawyer power to
keep fighting Qualcomm hoff so the I
fired them I just keep doing what doing
when saying no settlement and none of
that yeah it is kind of we're left in a
position here because a lot of us in the
PocketNow community are more inclined
towards and
you know Qualcomm has a great
relationship with those Android OEM so
whatever happens here might have ripple
effects down the road and mmm
whether or not it will have a net
benefit or net drag on whatever progress
gets done over on that side so I know
this is kind of a tough tackling issue
that we want to get into but at least in
terms of that it's worth it to be aware
of things as we go along here I mean
they when we look at Android and iOS we
have to keep in mind obviously you know
Qualcomm is a big player I mean Huawei
and the care and chipset we haven't
really seen that much presence on there
and so pretty much you know if Qualcomm
gets a big hit Android as an ecosystem
gets a hit so it's a big issue but I
don't think it's beneficial to either
one of the companies to basically
destroy the other I think realistically
this is a negotiation point of reference
I think Qualcomm realistically either a
fesses up to it but I mean we've seen
them have long battles like Yelena said
they have that lower power to stretch
things for years and we'll remember
Samsung and Apple and that took forever
I can't remember no no I think it did
end like it was tossed back down as like
the article of something about an
article of manufacture what could be
considered that and whether or not the
Samsung would owe this much a little bit
or this much Allah so exactly just how
badly that was like seven years so
[Laughter]
mentoring the other there's mobile
wearables you know always connected PCs
so we're starting to see the Qualcomm
chipset in more markets than just mobile
mobile smartphones it needs to stay
relevant needs to stay relevant in the
5g era that many have argued it has
pioneered and
you know a lot of catch up especially
you know with the new standard Intel and
mediatek are kind of one of the backups
that Apple is considering for in that
2020 I phone so I'm will have to see
where that goes and how the rest of my
kid plays itself out let's go to the
rest of the market for a little bit
shall we let's talk about LG I know this
was announced that alpha why does it
exist so we have the LG G seven fits
which I have a called 2018 Snapdragon
820 one phone and it was just announced
for wide availability in most of the
world I'm not sure about North America
but the rest of the world will get it
and I'm wondering what is what's going
on here because back in 2017 the LD g6
launched with a Snapdragon 820 one and
that was already kind of six months out
of it and I don't know like what the
deal was between Cal common LG how many
cuz like they were I think there were
several more models that had the 821 in
it from LG like how many how many parts
did Qualcomm give to LG in order for
this did they have happened cuz this is
kind of weird this is kind of insane so
it has a lot of the healthy g7 think you
specs you're talking about the 6.1 inch
display that's super bright and whatnot
3000 milliamp hour battery is kind of
okay single cameras on the back of
language alright it's fine but remind me
of the year that the LG G 7 one edition
so yeah yeah didn't that go with this
one of the six hundreds yeah no so that
was a little bit less powered but with
the what they did is a similar a similar
form factor where they took some stuff
from the g7 and they kind of write it
down a little bit and I think it's
mostly maybe just a pricing kind of an
approach to how to sell this phone uh
what do you think about this this whole
thing Halina at the moment well I have
two separate thoughts once the name is
horrible because
here I think it's gonna be like a
wearable that matches up with the LGD
seven um so there's just like confusion
right away there for me this is LG's
foldable phone and you can wrap it
around your wrist and it becomes your
would be a great name for it but the
other part like to me it seems like
they're trying to come out with another
one answer to the oneplus and they don't
really have it yet but this is like that
kind of there either but it's similar to
the other one to the LG G 7 1 edition
it's just like hey we have another more
affordable handset or maybe this is
their answer to the iPhone XR because
the v40 think you just on a peer price
competition point yeah yeah that's what
it seems like especially if it doesn't
come out in North America and those
other markets where there's high demand
for more affordable devices it makes
sense for them will it be successful I
yeah well you know exactly it's where
those go ahead TJ I was gonna to echo
Elena's point of reference if you yeah
when you start looking at the
specifications what they have they've
given it enough kind of unique features
but not enough for it to compete with
the US market so it doesn't really make
sense for us to get it as competition to
the g7 thank you but you know other
markets that would have wanted an IP 68
phone this is not a bad deal I mean it's
water resistant it does come out with
Oreo which is a little bit interesting
but again they probably will at some
point next year push it up and it still
has a pretty good display it's not that
bad actually it's a good contender ad
821 is a still a powerful you know SOC
it's just it's a few years behind quite
a few years I would be kind of concerned
about it going into the end and its
support life from Qualcomm I'm not sure
how long these chips are patched for on
there and in the dish sure if it matters
that much anyways since LG when being
climbed as much to patch up their older
phones or is whether minor phones you
could say for that I I'm not sure where
the guarantee kicks in because Android
recently introduced a requirement I
think it was with PI though it was with
time and this is with Oreo that you had
that all Android phones must be a
two-year
for soccer updates but yeah you have any
more thoughts
Halina I was just saying maybe they had
like a whole load of 820 ones lying
around that they had like all of the 820
ones it was like late in what what was
it 2016 and by that time everyone a lot
of om had passed them over and it was
like well what are we going to do with
all these 820 ones ship and there have
been and toss it over to LG and that's
in and like I hate I would hate to think
that those chipsets have been lying
around for like a year and a half in
some dusty bin before it was like okay
let's bring them out for it still could
do pretty well depends on the market
that it's gonna go into like I said it's
it's still a powerful CPU we're looking
at I mean the reality is if we're
looking at LG's performance the update
cycle of the procedure that they go
through with their updates we're
probably not gonna get that many updates
on this phone anyways so for the most
part it really will will serve the life
cycle of what their general you know
update cycle that we get for their phone
so depends on the market and if the
price is right it's still better than
having a 600 you know 600 leveled septet
you know the 820 one is pretty powerful
and I'm just kind of that does that
value proposition does it work in my
head I'm sorry it just don't know where
the run demographic to keep that in mind
right now just it's like come on come on
you could even like take the 630 you
take the 6 6 36 or whatever come on just
trade them in recycle the the materials
please alright
since my blood pressures already at a
little bit higher than it should be
let's some talk about the Asus zenfone 6
which I will put on screen right now so
listeners I'm sorry you can go to
pocketnow.com slash podcast and click on
the latest episode for the rundown and
you'll be able to see the pleasure that
is this this is apparently a leak from
HD blog Italy or ITB
that's the two-letter code for the
country in any case this is supposedly
the Asus zenfone 6 it's got a little
tiny speaker it's got minimal bezels
that's that's alright and then um and
there's nothing else wrong here right
does anyone want to just spell the guts
spill the beans on this I kind of like
it
it doesn't bother me I actually think
this is where all these not just started
with pushing it to the right side the
top right of the display um I think it's
fine I think it's kind of like efficient
it kinda reminds you like like when you
the X part of your your window on a
desktop you know like it's kind of there
in the corner you don't really think
about it till you need it I like it
I don't know I would feel more yeah how
Android works yeah so yes I'm with you I
think it's very minimal I think the
teardrop effect the thing is gonna be
we're gonna see a lot of that I mean we
already see it with a lot of the new
devices even with Huawei with their 20x
teardrop is the next thing you know
oneplus did that as well offsetting it
though I I I feel less okay with it
because it's next to you the like for
the most stupid reason it's next to the
bat it's like cramping the battery
information where I guess I would have
actually felt more okay with it
if it were next to the time is where it
separated the time because most of the
time when you're looking up and your
smartphone for a second it was like oh
you checked the time and perhaps if this
were like an AMOLED display like that
that would be great because it's you're
laying up so few pixels and be right
there in a delineating kind of way and I
would have liked that but instead it's
on the right side next to the battery
information and then sorry cuz I was
just saying it for me it's more of a
symmetry thing it's just purely that's
what it is I'm not I don't have a
problem with the fact that it's a
teardrop effect it's just the symmetry
of where it's positioned for me I I
think the center portion would make
sense as most notifications kind of pop
up from the right and from the left on
the device
and having an offset either to the right
it just kind of throws off for me to
look and it looks like they're not
allowing it to I mean we have to still
see how they treat the UI with it
androids more configured to run with the
knobs in the center with all of their
configuration so did they change that or
how are they routing all the
notifications in the notification panel
on this yeah Hellena yeah no I I agree
what TK said I think it comes down to
the UI and this probably isn't the final
look right so they can just tweak it to
make it look more finessed I don't think
it'll bother us as much so I've had
literally 0.4 femtoseconds to think
about the other side of this and if
you're in a language with left to rights
you could actually pull off a
notification decently just by having in
the standard length instead of having to
adjust for the notch because that's
mostly where your text is going to be on
the top level and then the bottom level
you would have a full line of text that
you could insert if you needed it so I
don't know I mean there there is some
thought to it maybe if you know if we
went to Arab speaking countries our
right to right-to-left languages then
perhaps this would feel much more wrong
but who knows and so I'm all for smaller
bezels and trying to figure out creative
ways to put the camera module in there
we mean the reality is we're starting to
see full display phones right we're
starting to see these things with
mechanism I don't know the best way to
describe it would be basically hiding it
behind the entire display oh you're
showing off that what was it mean magic
to not to me make the magic - okay the
other guy that came out of the market at
the same time I think that solutions
more digging let's just saying I know I
know but so the kid part of me loves
playing with this homepage I know I'm
gonna break it but the reality is I
think it all comes down to the UI and
the experience placing the placing in
the middle or on the right or the left
as long as you make the rest of the UI
cohesive and it looks right and when
you're playing movies and stuff it
doesn't just sit there and kind of looks
odd for you I think realistically they
don't nobody
you should worry about it but what
they're doing right now is they're the
first people to do it if this is true
and I think it'll catch a lot of press
by that that's I think that's movements
what they're trying to go for it's it's
a mighty Kay do me a favor and just
click that few times right next to your
microphone no no phone the phone oh yeah
do it so will good will be going into
pocket now ASMR in the near future and
that was just a preview of what you can
look forward to so in the meantime we'll
be moving on and say goodbye to lots of
hands-on coverage that we've been being
able to pull off with a TK joining or a
video crew every once in awhile so much
appreciate and not for it in the
meantime we shall say goodbye to a
couple of old friends here the nexuses
have received their last updates their
last guaranteed a taste at the very
least they've reached the point
st. where it's been 18 months since
they've left the Google store and now
the Nexus 5x made by LG and the Nexus 6p
from Huawei are now officially out of
service it's a sad day for a lot of
people who kind of cherished the last
bastions of what it meant for Google to
have its name behind a phone well it may
be targeted towards developers or was it
just maybe turning the corner around
towards that consumer appeal because
obviously the next year after we had the
pixel phones that's all made by Google
and was like all these consumer friendly
features any you know eulogies that's
the word I'm trying to think of eulogies
for me I'll start with Hellena on this
one oh they were great phones right now
I'm imagining them on an island Clippy
yeah yeah no I mean they really were
iconic Android handsets and I think that
a lot of people hung onto them for a
long time but it's what kind of sad is
that they're not that old but yet they
feel sold cuz so much has changed in a
few years it's it's kind of crazy to
think how far we've come and just since
what 2015 I think we've grown older than
the phones have to be honest it's been
crazy
TK from you so I will basically spill
the proverbial drink for our fallen
heroes and but I will always be so
as you know obviously with XDA
everything never really dies dies really
it's a more of a reincarnation so wasn't
one of the benefits of having Nexus
devices and one of the main reasons why
a lot of developers fell in love with
them and even enthusiasts was the fact
that they were easily unlockable easily
test beds for many many different
versions of software and I think if
there's anything to learn from this is
that you know yes official support has
gone down obviously as we're reaching
that timeline but your devices would
hopefully live on and XDA definitely has
a big community that love their Nexus
the next side devices myself included I
don't have the 6p I have the 6 and the
5x so for me the definitely they will
live on and I love the designs I always
really wish that the Nexus line carried
but I do appreciate what the pixel line
is bringing into the table that was a
beautiful eulogy
very well done very well done and I
guess my foray into this was with the
Nexus 5 I got on with the last little
bit of it the last little tail end of
that train Nexus 5x which introduced me
to product I actually so and I've been
enjoying it ever since so thank you
google for that I guess and also just
thank you for having the developer in
mind in terms of both software and
hardware for the time that has been and
right now I don't know what's that's
happening I think I've heard about a
pixel 3 that's not being fixed so too
bad for that I think it was the one that
was um
that got shipped to the customer all
smashed up and they say I don't believe
there it's that's yeah something for the
red it's the that you can look at
unfortunately in the meantime we'll be
transitioning over to Samsung in just a
couple of minutes but not before we take
our first break we'll be right back
the PocketNow weekly is brought to you
by the National Security Agency almost
every day we hear something on the news
about a cyber attack sometimes it's just
a bunch of pranksters but more often
it's a foreign country with vast cyber
resources trying to hack our power grid
our baking systems or our military's
information networks the National
Security Agency plays a big part in
protecting our country from cyberattacks
and you can help the NSA is hiring
technical professionals to serve on the
front lines of information security if
you work in consider if you work in
computer science networking programming
or electrical engineering you can help
keep our country safe design new
hardware systems and networks right
faster smarter programs protect
America's critical infrastructure or
help uncover what our adversaries are

supported by one plus if you want one of
the fastest phones this year look no
further than the one plus 60 with a huge

information whoo all right let me
recover a little bit with a little
trinket I'll get back to you
all right and we are back and here to
just unwind a little bit because I do
want to continue one of Joshua's
favorites habits and check in with both
of you and how your weeks been doing
I'll say that my week has been going
just swimmingly I've been exploring in
New England who I've been working online
so it's life aound one of my favorite
sandwich places now it's it's right down
near the border of Massachusetts and
Rhode Island called the beef barn it's
very cute and I love the roast beef
sandwiches it's great
TK what do you think what's been your
week my week is it's been an interesting
week up and down I've been you know a
lot of good news coming out as far as
mobile tech and just overall I would
have to say knee-deep in Huawei and
honor land for the most part this week
for me a lot of new tech a lot of new
phones new you know form factor so
keeping myself busy and probably be
doing another live stream coming after
this for an unboxing of the new palm Hey
look at the opposite of what I did $350
add-on from Verizon that you have to
have a line for and it's cute I want to
check it out I want to see how it works
does it really makes sense to have a
secondary phone as a I don't know the
concept is a little bit confusing for me
you know I have a watch but apparently I
need a phone you should perhaps TK
what's your a YouTube channel by the way
just so we youtube.com for /tka t ka ba
y great Gradius a XD err TK XD a that
comes up yeah yeah so you can keep track
of left and make sure that you tune in
for that unboxing of the palm phone
Halina
I want to ask you how your week has been
it has been pretty good what's been nice
about this week is that there hasn't
been any really big like constant
launches every day or five a day but
I've actually started so I'm gonna be
able to play with this product which
finally got to unbox even though it's
that's the new a Lenovo yoga 9-3 oh yes
I can't get behind the whole letters and
numbers thing it's just like it's the
yoga book to it it it's much much
improved over the first generation
they're using an ink display
I'm instead of that like your keyboard
it's much much better for typing there's
a better better processor now a much
better display overall much much nicer
it still needs a few just little room
for improvement but it's it's it's
actually quite an enjoyable
none of that paper on pet and thing
going on anymore that's a it's a welcome
sight to see so I look forward to
reading more about that on geek spin dot
Co Co that's a little plug for you right
there looking forward to that one too I
I was excited when I got a chance to see
that with Jaime Eddie fun yeah that is a
just yeah well the reviews live on the
site since you plugged it just say there
we go there you go well if they're mean
if I'm gonna be beautiful in my whole
plugging attitude than beef barn calm I
think I'm not sure if that's the right
address I might have to look it up later
and not a sponsor
hashtag no sponsor alright shall we take
another crack at this and talk about
things that should be unfolding in front
of us mmm but that's a question that you
should say yes or no to I I want I want
an unfolding story yeah okay I'm trying
to fill up time between coming up tabs a
little story a little little little
thing going on I guess is this week we
saw the first prototype of or at least
the first public prototype of the galaxy
what we've been thinking of as the
Galaxy F F stand for foldable and this
is it this is a thing that we see here
it's very blocky but that's because and
not not just the picture quality but
just the actual phone but that's because
it is obscured for trade-secret purposes
I guess but what I really wanted to
catch and I being the very weird person
I am I want to like get the screen
capture tool up for the video the live
stream because that's where they were
showing it off and I've tried so hard
like to get this exact frame like down
because like I was seeing it is like
well you can show the phone that either
in its flat mode or it has that exterior
screen if I wanted to make sure I wanted
to get the the folding like the creasing
going on in there because that's the
important thing that's being shown off
here is that creasing screen with the
Infinity flex display and they have a
new UI to go with it one year why
they're talking about which is uh
introduces a new paradigm and that's the
action area there's like an action area
at the bottom of the screen because of
course you can't really you deal with
all the controls
you can't just be pressing buttons all
over the screen because that's really
not that convenient at all as screens go
taller and then you have them I forget
what the top half is called I think it's
like an action and not bad action area
but like a viewing area for some of the
items that you want to see on top you
know you don't have to interact with
them you just see it and that's great so
I look forward to that paradigm we're
talking about the display it's a Super
AMOLED display I think it's like 1600 PE
and a 3x2 aspect I believe on that unit
it looks like oh yeah more of a boxy
yeah yeah yeah and there were also kind
of suggestions of notches potential
notches and holes in the display so that
you can fit in cameras because that's
something that you might want to
consider Samsung um so hey that's
something if you want to think about and
then Android decided hey we have a
Developers Conference too let's announce
port officially for foldable displays so
there you go I want to get your first
impressions on what you were able to
look at Hellena in terms of like did
this meet your expectations of what you
want to see from a foldable Samsung
phone so no it didn't
I'm granted that what they showed off
was you know dark and in they said it's
a prototype but I have lots of problems
with us okay number one the bezels on
that thing look gigantic that freaks me
out
number two it looks so thick like it
looks thick and heavy and I don't want
that as of everyday phone the yoga book
I just showed off was thinner than that
um that's not futuristic to me and again
this was a prototype so who knows what
the final device will look like but it
makes me think of the ZTE axon M which
was you know it's great concept but at
the end of the day it wasn't something
that you'd want to carry around every
day but Haas it was too thick and heavy
and it's almost like we're going
backwards in time to fold of all PDAs
and pop it just to me it doesn't work
what I really want and what I thought
we'd be seeing by now is a flexible roll
mobile display that's what um where are
those like I felt like there was talked
about it a couple years ago and now it's
just are we 10 years out from that like
that disappoints me so much um I won't
jump into the other you I thought that
you you you touched on just yet because
I feel like you probably want to fit to
keep I was telling to say about the
foldable oh yeah and I also have some
follow-on thoughts from your
observations too because I feel like
there's a lot that might be going on and
said with this picture here but TK what
are your first impressions I I could not
have I cannot agree more well so I'm
with you on as far as the design ah now
as far as the fold there was I know a
lot of people focused on when he was
holding the phone and when he was
folding it and the whole mechanism
obviously there is a case around that
but actually in some of the materials
when they were during the the keynote
they show you basically that it actually
never folds all the way they showed you
almost kind of like a teardrop with look
on it where it kind of opened and there
was an opening in the center and that
just tells me that Doria like the
surface book right yeah it has that a
little bit a little bit of an opening at
the bottom which tells me that this is
not a hundred percent foldable very
early like they are not sure how to
actually because it doesn't really fold
right if it doesn't actually close it's
not really folding and if yeah the way I
saw it
it looks like basically a device that
will have a little bit of a thicker gap
at the bottom and where the display kind
of gets at the when it's curving and
like you said Leena is probably gonna
have you know bezels all over the place
I think it's a more Bulow fact I would
prefer kind of like what we saw it Etha
with the Nubia SmartWatch if you I don't
know if you had a chance to check that
out but that we can display that works
on as a you know a SmartWatch more form
factors like that wearables I think that
works better for us as opposed to having
a phone you know it's just it's just
yeah we're going backwards we're making
thicker wider phones - hey that's kind
of that's kind of interesting that you
point that out I didn't actually notice
that the first go-around in which case
it would have like I guess discounting
that in terms of my original follow-on
thoughts from Hellena is that well I
like there's there's there's that case
we aren't sure what's going on here but
I would love to see the hinge on this
and just think about well how much of a
exposure does that leave the screen in
terms of any potential impacts or
there's just a lot of things and all
right so there's a very frustrated about
this because it's like so why if that if
we're at this state and we're at this
kind of crosshair crossroads was it
really it was this really the time do
you win like could this have waited
another six months another year or is
this coming to a point where it's
do-or-die and we are going to have to
see this technology sink or float be
written off as one of those fads
you know perhaps changes the way or the
way that we use mobile phones like I'm
not sure about the timing of this 3d
televisions remember when it was like so
hot and everybody was doing it even
though it was complete listen it wasn't
well implemented this is like the same
thing all over those and we we have to
keep in mind that in reality they never
actually said that this is the phone
that's coming out this could be just a a
very high really good prototype that
they're able to show off the technology
as far as the folding technology and
they may implement this as more of a
wearable or maybe flexible display not
necessarily something because if you see
that that gap in the image and the fact
that there is that big of a gap nobody
will ever put that phone in their pocket
I mean can you imagine sitting on the
pocket when you fall in line sitting
like there I'm like you can't it's just
it's really I really it's a proof of
concept I hope and I really hope that
they use this technology to bring more
better to better displays flexible
showing us that they can do the flexible
OLED with the with their new mechanism
and the kalua the adhesive they talked
about as far as you know how this is so
new so good but again what happened to
that flexible display we saw a few years
back like Elena was talking about we've
seen this before this is not brand new
it just now looks like a phone and yeah
yeah I don't know better we do want
better and we want it sooner honestly
but I'm just kind of concerned about
this because you know it consumer
reactions will lay out how much more
investment gets put into what whatever
this vertical might become or if it
doesn't become anything at all so and I
do want to see it come I do want to see
it arrive but you know in terms of like
the little things that we can't think of
I like how you know durable is like for
hundreds of thousands of folds which
many people think of as maybe lasting
several years at the very least two
years and Brad even like creasing like
what does that do to the subpixels like
what what happens there
so because technically we're not at the
point of foldables as much as bendables
and if you were to fold it well like how
well what's the efficacy of it unfolding
it and you know reason like you said
this is more of a full well foldable
bendable not foldable it's the opposite
I feel like it was more of a bending
display not necessarily don't call it
foldable as soon as we're able to like
show like a little art piece I'm like an
origami display with a swan and you know
like it'd be like the first major art
piece that could rival things like like
the Metropolitan Museum or something
like I don't know let's quickly head on
one UI for a little bit and talk about
is this a much-needed change in terms of
what we've dealt with beforehand in
terms of mobile you eyes because again
those displays are getting taller and
taller so TK what's your thought I think
it's a it's a good movement in a sense
of how the touch UI or TouchWiz UI or
even Samsung's UI is gonna have you know
going through its evolutions it looks
nicer it's capitalizing on darker UI
saving battery it's definitely I want to
say it's the move in the right direction
for them I'm hoping the adoption that
they're trying to bring in will carry
over multiple generations of phones
because at least from the announcement
that we saw at least it looks great it
works great with long form factor
devices which they have for the last
couple years and I think the reality the
matter is it's probably gonna be
something we need to get used to it's
different and it's no longer them trying
to be like others they're trying to come
up with their own design which I really
think it's a good idea I think it looks
good and I just hope that you know at
least the last few generations of
devices will get this UI is their
historic implementation of their new UI
so you really don't carry back that far
so I'm hoping at least for this year and
last year yeah this year's phones are
going to have this updated I think in
January it's remained to be seen for the
s8 and no
eight or wasn't it no way then that's a
generation yeah the sa generation there
was a question on that and then there's
also the betas as you probably may have
heard it as well they're pushing out
some betas for some of their devices for
this year's carrier the s9 and the s9 +
so it's a wait-and-see kind of thing
going on
hi I'm Elena
your first impressions on what UI and it
looks really swanky I'll tell you that
it looks clean and an intuitive I make
sense why they're doing it I mean Huawei
with a May 20 Pro and Mui a 9 they made
an emphasis about they put an emphasis
on the fact that it's new designed for
one-handed use so that seems to be the
direction that all these companies need
to go in because phones are getting
bigger and longer right so you got a
adapt to that
I feel like always not making it any
easier than point two inch display is
massive that is scary
that is weird and yeah so I guess
there's that and finally is it time for
a pink and a green phone I think that's
well hey Mari hasn't haven't phone's
been going out in like green and pink
and blue for for a while now remember
there was a green phone and there are so
there Galaxy s8 or the s7 that there was
a green version but it didn't come to
the Emerald yeah there was like an
emerald green yeah yeah you're right uh
and then there's there's a there was the
what pink is kind of like more often
these days because there's it's always
been masked and like orchid or violet or
whatever but like the thing we're
talking about is that there was like the
one color oh yeah oh yeah go ahead a
later
yeah no the going back to the wall we
made 20 Pro I mean they have a green and
they're calling it Emeril maybe but it's
beautiful like they've done a really
good job with their green and I think
it's the most attractive choice from the
different of mate 20 Pro options so I in
green might be the new rose gold next
year I don't know well so because
obviously it's just one slide of this
Samsung developer conference a
presentation but it suggested that well
one UI does actually take a color
scheming off of the devices physical
color and it was showing off with a
green and pink and whatnot so I mean
that's always interesting to think about
it but I've always yeah ya know I've
always mourned moto maker because like
we lost moto maker and it's just like I
still want that freaking orange phone
the orange silica on you know red
backing and like maybe like a few other
citrus colors and like that would have
been my jam I would have been happy with
that said why is it no I forgot all
about moto maker and now that you
mention it like that's actually really
missed that those customization options
they were amazing so maybe from now on
on every every podcast we should have
like a something that died that we we
need to pay our respects to that should
just be a little bit of a like something
that you for Ontario just get out the
Nexus the Moto maker do you have
anything that we want to pad out with we
got a couple more minutes TK what's one
thing that has recently died that you
want to say goodbye to you you know
actually I want to say probably the the
small form-factor phone not not the
palm-sized phone I'm talking like the
small 5-inch 4-inch phone the fact that
I matter is even with a smaller smaller
pixel we're still getting above 5 inches
in there is still and not to try to give
it to Apple that you know that the last
Apple you know the SE is basically the
end of a line of devices that we no
longer have a the ability of looking for
what's right mean what we have now is
the XR and that's the smallest that
they'll carry
and so if if there's any if there's ever
been a demand for a form factor that is
still small that answers the same
powerhouse requirements of the new
phones I feel like we're losing that war
a lot of our phones are opposite just so
big now that the small phone looks weird
so I wish that would come back we'll see
we'll see pompona Bachchan youtube.com
slash TK Bay Elena as I hardly tried to
think of something that might I might
want a more do you have any ideas okay
so I definitely would need more time to
think this one through especially since
the other ones we brought up we're so
strong but I am gonna mention something
that I was recently thinking about not
exactly mobility related but the
connected the connected a skill like
when you went for weighing yourself I
feel like that was really hot a couple
of years ago and now I don't know if
anyone's doing it um and it's kind of
and it's kind of something that I would
like to have again Radim er yeah yeah
it's cuz I know here just did away with
its a health division and I'm not sure
it cuz Withings the original company it
did go back to its original ownership
and I'm not sure if they're still really
as focused on that digital scale as much
as anything else so well about that I I
don't know for me perhaps it's Windows
10 mobile like I've always wanted to try
out a third OS that and I've never
really gotten to you I did own what was
it it was one of the later phones that
had two snapdragon 212 on it and i
didn't really use it much and i ended up
selling it off and like a couple of
months but how ever really looking into
it so yeah that's like good but like the
tiles the metro was a pretty appealing
to be Metro UI it's just there weren't
really any apps sorry to say I'm pretty
sure we'll see some new things and bring
some nostalgia back you
foldable tiny computers Microsoft maybe
you could do that surface surface uh
phone sure let's bring that back let's
talk about that again because that
hasn't fruited anything in this uh in
this world in this time line in any case
