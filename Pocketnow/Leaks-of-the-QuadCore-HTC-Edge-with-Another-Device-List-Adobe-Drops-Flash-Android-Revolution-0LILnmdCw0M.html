which plans to be their first quad-core
smartphone we then sit back and leak
another big list of HTC devices and well
all hell freezes over as Adobe drops
flash player for mobile devices all to
send more coming up right now
hello we r 1 i'm high memory better with
talking out common welcome to android
revolution the show we go through what's
hot and what's not inside the world of
google's android project let start this
week off what's hot let's start this
week off with linksys we know you hate
all of them are mad evan blasted a great
job in unveiling and expect that HTC
edge device which plants to be their
first quad-core smartphone it brings a
massive 4.7 inch display with 720p
resolution and some sort of invisible
glass technology which plans to blow all
of us away with some sort of
mind-blowing technology change the
design seems to be quite different to
what we know from HTC so we could expect
something compelling though we don't
really know who's going to manufacture
that quad core processor it could be the
Tegra kal-el processor but we still
don't know aside from that Evan that
another great job in unveiling a full
list of HTC devices with a lot of weird
names now it's a really big roadmap so
make sure you follow the link in the
description for the full names and hey
they even have an HTC grande or like
everybody likes to say it grand in
Spanish and well it just seems like HTC
needs to figure out how to use numbers
instead of names imagine hey showing
your phone yeah i'm bringing my CC
grande anyways and since we started the
week off with leaks let's go through
some more first of all have a look at
this image that evan unvieled recently
of an LG device sporting ice cream
sandwich now interesting enough it does
seem like it brings a mophie juice pack
and well no fees not going to build the
juice pack for an underdog smartphone
most likely this could be the next LG's
flagship so let's wait and see what
happens and speaking of LG remember that
ignite and majestic devices that we
leaked recently well it seems that it
could be the variant of the optimus
black that we already know so nothing
really big here just carrier variants
though we don't know what the carriers
are yet and behold we caught images of
an HTC sensation XE in white and while
it was only a matter of time it seems
that white is the new black we also
recently caught images of an HTC bill
which is planning to Bhd's first Ice
Cream Sandwich smartphone though we
don't really know what to expect because
the image looks like some really poor
job in Photoshop so don't hold your
breath there because doesn't really look
compelling
hardware and image specs were also
leaked of a Samson illusion though hold
your breath there because it's not
really any illusion device to think of
because specs are really mid-ranged and
welcoming across sony ericsson it does
seem that we found some other images of
the Xperia Arc HD though again it does
seem that the device will bring some
compelling specs but sadly not really
sure who's getting it and went out of
the smartphone releases for the week
Samson just did be inevitable they
brought their own samsung galaxy s2 in
pink if you could actually call that pig
because it looks more like red or orange
peach mixed with pink or something like
that we know you guys love pink so make
sure you hit the device soon not sure
when it's coming but I'm not on the list
of people that are waiting for it
definitely and will speed of software
Firefox 8 just left beta so make sure
you download the update because it looks
really good and PayPal also brought NFC
technology for Android so make sure you
download the update because it looks
really good for those devices that do
support NFC I think it's only a couple
out of this week's coverage make sure
you catch the end Webster's recent
unboxing and the Vice videos of the
Titanic Samsung Galaxy S note which is
big in every way because hey the stylus
performance that seemed quite good it
does seem compelling so make sure you
catch the videos which are up here and
well aside from that Joe leave I also
brought as an article a really
interesting one with a device list of
all the devices that can get ice cream
sandwich already with the port so make
sure you hit the link in the description
with all the details because there are a
lot of Samsung devices out there really
interesting and that same Joe just got
his hands on a motorola razr from
verizon which looks really really good i
mean the droid razr looks compelling in
both performance and design so make sure
you catch the links for the videos
upstairs because the device is really
good and well since we begun the week
talking about quad-core processors
nvidia has just announced a new Tegra 3
SOC processor that plans to bring pc
like performance to mobile devices now
this is a Penta core processor that
actually is based on the kal-el
quad-core processor that nobody's using
it and well apparently it brings an
additional additional core that's
based on even more chords that bring you
graphics performance that's highly
superior now it says to be mind-blowing
though we still don't know when we're
getting it it could be that we could
probably see it next year on CES so stay
tuned for our coverage because
definitely this could be the processor
that's going to be powering the new HTC
edge device that we were talking about
let's see that does it for what's hot
let's continue on with what's not in
well what do you know it seems that the
adobe flash battle has finally come to
an end adobe has sat down and accepted
that html5 is superior then flash
performance and they're apparently
working on porting their Adobe Flash
content to html5 and they also have
offered tools in the past to be able to
do that now even though a lot of you may
the further Adobe Flash this play well
on Android browsers some of us may defer
because it does work but it doesn't work
well all the time and it definitely
seems to be a battery hog on devices so
we're glad to see that adobe has finally
bit the bullet about this and begun
working on the feature which is 80 ml 5
now let's see what adobe comes up with
with the current flash applications that
are out there and let's see what they
come up with to be able to make
developers happy with everything that's
coming up and changes so not really sure
what to expect for the future but sadly
only certain manufacturers are planning
to work on the flash players for the
future but don't expect any updates from
adobe on their flash player from here on
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching i'm high memory
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
