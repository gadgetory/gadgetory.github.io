boring giving consumers very little
elements of surprise lately this main
argument is what inspire the company to
reinvent its approach to smartphones and
the first piece of that puzzle comes in
a very unfamiliar form i'm hi natalie
that i with PocketNow reporting from MWC
in barcelona and this is our hands-on of
the LG g5 brought to you by deep brand
at a time when most competitors were
reiterating what they did last year this
LG g5 is a dramatic evolution to the
smartphone we knew we say evolution
instead of change because most of the
elements of what made LG's G lineup are
still here they're just packed in a
different package the plastic and
leather touches of the g4 have taken a
few leaps forward with this g5 as this
is not just your average metallic
smartphone notice the lack of antenna
lines all around that's because the
company has come up with a new treatment
that allows for antennas to work below
it oddly that blend doesn't really feel
cool to the touch we as with most
metallic phones but that doesn't really
change the fact that this phone is
gorgeous at a glance from the inner
champers at the back to the gentle
curves all around and the curved details
at the top this phone looks a lot better
in the hand at what you've seen in leaks
in the previous days that's not the only
change though LG did a good job at the
emphasising the specs in the
presentation yes the Snapdragon 820 is
here along with 4 gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of expandable storage via an
extended SIM tray and also making the
cut a small comes quick charge 3.0 via
USB type-c the 5.3 inch quad HD display
is still IPS but now allows for an
always-on mode that LG claims to be
superior to AMOLED and this display can
go as bright as 900 nits for when you're
out in direct sunlight that being said
most of these specifications weren't
really mentioned in the presentation as
the company instead spent more time
focusing on how different this phone is
they calls it modular because of the
cool slot down below which still doesn't
have a name by the way
press the button on the side and you're
quickly taken to the replaceable battery
and this slot can later be extended by
other features like the campus camera
grip which will
talk about in a separate video yes the
phone will turn off when you do this but
so that every previous lg phone whenever
you remove the battery anyways and
speaking of cameras there are two
primary ones here both with separate
sensors one is a standard 16 megapixel
shooter with at 1.8 aperture and 75
degrees of field of view which is what
you'll see in an average camera while
the other is an ultra wide-angle 8
megapixel shooter with 135 degrees of
field of view the company explained how
the human eyes field of view is only of
128 degrees making this feature awesome
since you can't really zoom out of
subjects and instead have to step back
so this can really come in handy in
areas where you really cannot step back
because you'll just lose the purpose of
a shot both cameras can work together to
stitch a photo that blends both elements
or gives you the option of two different
shots that give you two different
perspectives of the same area aside from
that the software is android 6.0.1
marshmallow running under LG's new UI
which still lacks cohesion here and
there and where the app tray is now gone
as LG claims that it will help in
avoiding confusion that we do know this
will be a controversial change still
folks there is so much to talk about
this LG g5 seriously this is a very
different animal to what we've seen
before so much so that there are
different videos that we are preparing
just to talk about the different
features and LG's new friends as they're
calling the accessories that also
complement the g5 so stay tuned for
these videos coming very soon ok now is
