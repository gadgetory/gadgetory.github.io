commitments and the fact that Apple
wants more graphics those will be
wanting to try Bigsby on non Galaxy S
eight devices actually have an
alternative and some sketchy new rumors
of the HTC Ocean have just emerged I'm
Jaime Rivera and when I found that there
was a shirt just like this that had
Deadpool saying red-hot chimichangas and
I didn't buy it I was really upset
this is pocket out daily official news
today begin with deals one of our
favorite smartphones last year was the
LGB 20 up to the point where I still use
it for a lot of video recording it is a
very capable device it is even good
enough to record audio and it's
currently for $450 at Newegg and this is
with the device being unlocked you can
learn one link in the description how
about if we talk about non deals as
amazon has just opened pre-orders for
the sony xperia x zs i hate the name i
hate the name and I hate the price tag
because this device is going to be
costing $700 and it's not even the
flexor I can't even imagine what'll
happen whenever the x/z premium comes to
town specifications aren't bad but again
it's just overpriced and sony is not
really doing a great job with
smartphones lately but we'll keep you
posted as we learn more there's well a
spotlight over to the HTC ocean as a
couple of interesting developments have
been merged we've got some leaked images
of the phone in theory these are renders
but if you look closely and I love them
my pal Nick gray points it out from HTC
source where he's like wait a second
this looks pretty much like the HTC you
play they just changed a couple of
elements on the screen so it could just
be that the images are really just fixed
renders we should learn more very soon
we hear this product that might emerge
around the day how about if we talk
about Samsung's Bigsby we are still
skeptical of this thing is going to take
off or not but if you want to give it a
try right now with limited functionality
there is a link in the description that
gives you the full tutorial from
xda-developers
bear in mind obviously you will need to
do some tweaking to your smart phone for
this to be able to work but yeah it's
kind of available for the s7 s7 edge so
long as you're running
and finally the very hot nurses they
have to do with the iPhone X and pretty
much every other iPhone variant as we
hear two very interesting things number
one is that Apple has ordered 70 million
OLED displays and if you do the math
this could pretty much mean that every
single iPhone launched in 2017 will
include an OLED display that's great the
second thing is that apparently Apple
wants to take graphics more seriously by
building its own GPU some analysts
predict that this has to do with the
company not wanting to depend on
imagination technologies that's great
but others believe that it could be that
Apple might just want to compete at a
higher tier which makes a lot of sense
but it leads me to the question of the
day do you think that Apple might want
to compete at a higher tier and we're
talking Nintendo switch for example
could it be that the company wants to
bring mobile gaming to another level
given what Nintendo's doing in my case I
actually think it does especially after
playing with the switch but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way
goes if you want to get the news earlier
