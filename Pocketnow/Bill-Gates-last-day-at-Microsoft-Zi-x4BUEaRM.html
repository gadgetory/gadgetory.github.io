pretty strange coincidence that this
transition date is right in the middle
of the 2008 presidential campaign would
be you're the best running mate I'm not
sure politics is really for you hey
of course we'll miss him in the daily
brainstorming meetings he's always been
an innovator really inspiring all of us
to think creatively about the future and
we'll be the first to give credit where
credit is due

like I said
but he's still bill and we'll miss
seeing him in the hallway every day
and all tech markets remain steady as
Bill Gates completed its historic last
full day at Microsoft personal note all
of us here at NBC News will miss
reporting every night about this
