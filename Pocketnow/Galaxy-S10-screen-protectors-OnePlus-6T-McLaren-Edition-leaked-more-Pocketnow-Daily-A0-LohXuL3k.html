Samsung Galaxy S 10 inthose show the
cutouts for the dual cameras that were
leaked other leaks have the expected
McClaren edition of the one plus sixty
showing up and if you're having bootloop
issues with the LG G seven it seems the
company is already working on a fix I'm
Jaime Mehta Rivera and you know it's sad
to leave Hawaii without a tan and with
huge allergies but it is what it is this
is PocketNow Daly sponsored by one plus
the official news today begin with a
Nokia actually hmd should we call it the
company is celebrating two years in the
market and even though I was one of the
people that was doubtful over the future
of what they were gonna do my god they
just provided numbers 70 million units
sold in two years and they want to
continue betting on the 300 to 400 euro
price range focusing more on teenagers
and just creating brand loyalty there
they've got great phones I mean I've
already got that note get 7.1 I promise
your review very soon it is a fantastic
device now for those of you that want to
use Isom ZUP on iphones in the united
states meeting that dual sim capability
verizon is the first carrier that's
providing support as of today apparently
you will be able to activate the service
in addition to I'm not exactly sure
Verizon is just activating this the isom
or if they're allowing dual-sim
capabilities that's gonna be an
interesting one but yeah Verizon is the
first one on whichever iPhone supports
it which would be the 10r 10s and 10's
max now let's talk about the LG g 7i you
know it's funny every time i make a
review of any LG phone and i get
comments about boot loops and boot loops
i've never had issues I've never met
anyone that has issues but it seems that
it is a thing now on the g7 again
because it's been a problem since the g4
so the g7 is having bootloop issues
particularly for people in t-mobile in
Europe so apparently a fix is coming
then it's funny when LG is like you can
call on us to tell to report the problem
like if your phone is working for you to
be able to do that
now let's talk about the oneplus sixty
McLaren edition we've been following the
leaks today we get probably the clearest
ones where we see the device with a very
interesting color in the back full
limited edition rumors of a faster way
to charge rumors of more ram we'll see
exactly what we get very soon and
finally the most interesting new suit
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 we saw the leaks of that
interesting cutout for the cameras now
we've got screen protectors and you know
the way these suppliers work once
they've got something they can bid on
they start creating products for it and
so it seems that the separation of the
cameras is bigger than what we saw in
the leaks so we're not exactly sure for
what variant it is or what functionality
Samsung is thinking of providing with
these dual cameras but I'm really loving
that wide-angle on the pixel 3xl
honestly if it's the only reason why
that not serves a purpose for me so stay
tuned this we figure out more and let us
know in the comments down below what do
you think do you like this design or not
cuz I honestly like it a lot leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion and folks before we end
this video we would love to thank our
sponsor oneplus for making this content
possible today we're really loving the
oneplus 60 especially now that there's a
third color option thunder purple which
is so beautiful and unique the oneplus
60 gives you flexibility without a
flagship price and now it's also
