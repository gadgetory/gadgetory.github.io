you'll get some treatment for that was
the person who asked you if you were 22
blind or stupid or both thanks brother
IMATS after 12am here why'd you make me
stay up so late waiting well you could
always just move over here but that's
right it's that time of the week I am
high memory that up this is pocket now
and this is the pocket out daily recap
for last week last week the conversation
began with the Galaxy s7 and the galaxy
s7 plus we had some tips that the device
will probably be available in February
and I asked you if you had to pick
between either of them which one would
you decide on we had 796 comments why do
we meet an s7 plus when we have the note
line and I totally agree with you but
then again I don't know it's always good
to have variety and Samsung is just huge
on that I would choose the s7 plus
because I would be more productive with
a screen that large and also consuming
media would be better I do agree I am
becoming fond of phablets they are just
more convenient for the things that we
usually do on smartphones lately then
again a lot of people don't agree at
seven plus the moment i got a 5.5 inch
phone i could not go back the large
screen is amazing for watching movies
and videos agreed a lot of people again
prefer it but then again other people
need to be productive in a way that they
use their phones as a tool and therefore
I do agree that large displays are not
necessarily convenient for people on the
move but on Tuesday we merge the
conversation to the iphone particularly
because we hear that iphone sales are
down and I ask you exactly what do you
think is happening to the market we had
a crazy 1200 and for comments thanks a
lot guys we start with G bones are
getting good good phones are getting
cheap yes the premium midranges the
cheekbones are getting good and then
good phones like the one plus two are
just getting cheaper and cheaper we are
getting very good products this is a
great time for the market and I do agree
that the iphone needs to figure that
price tag out google + 1 + are actually
releasing decent phones with less
gimmicks that don't cost an arm a leg
and uh yeah you read that that is what i
would i think and yeah i do agree we
aren't getting more variety and it is
just amazing these phones are getting
better
necessarily for the media consumption as
apps are just getting more complex true
but then again for the basics that's
really all you need I think it's that
phones are getting so good that people
aren't needing to upgrade them every
year I well I don't agree with that
companies have something that's called
planned obsolescence I feel that right
now that i'm using the iphone 6 every
now and then it's a one year old phone
and it behaves like it's an old foe
because apple is already making it
clunky or intentionally just to get you
to buy the new iphone which I hate
unless a the topic was the iphone 7
rumors have it that Apple is working on
some new materials to get rid of the
antenna lines and I asked you if you
would care about an iphone with new
materials or that wasn't made of
aluminum we had 788 comments we start
with I wouldn't mind as long as it
wasn't made of plastic and you know this
is rather interesting I do prefer
aluminum phones but then again plastic
bones are actually more resilient than
most cases though with the 7000 series
aluminum that would be the exception to
the rule internal lines on the iphone
don't bother me LOL and it's funny but
most of the comments were actually
focused on that they didn't mind the
antenna lines and well hey that's cool
for you Apple should have just stayed
with the iphone 5s design a lot of
people also made this comment and yeah I
do like the fact that Apple played with
aluminum and glass I feel that would be
a very you know elegant alternative
let's just see if Apple follows that or
figures out something else but on
Thursday the topic was again the iphone
we heard that samsung and LG were very
close to signing a deal with Apple
regarding OLED displays and I asked you
what was your favorite display
technology and the funny part is that
most of the comments weren't really
about that but anyways we had 983 of
them we start with IPS natural colors
and this was actually the only comment
that was focused on IPS everybody else
preferred OLED but yeah true IPS does a
better job when it comes to color
reproduction in almost every case I will
be like we are having to announce a
revolutionary new feature in the iphone
retina LED is here and you know you're
making fun of this you got a lot of
likes because you're actually right
that's the way Apple does it question is
why wouldn't you want OLED displays and
that's a very interesting point but then
again a lot of people again prefer the
color reproduction of IPs and then other
people
from my day where oled displays were
pentile and then again we wouldn't have
the quality of color and contrast that
we had with IPS obviously Samsung
doesn't has done an amazing job with
that we just would like to see how Apple
would implement it on an iPhone and then
finally Friday the topic was the LG g5
we heard that some of the specifications
that we see it on the b10 will come to
the g5 but then again some of the specs
will actually drop like battery capacity
in addition to other things and I asked
you are you excited for the g5 rumors or
not we had 916 comments we start with LG
needs to change its ugly you I first and
yes high-five I do agree with that I
can't wait for the g5i oh the g4 right
now and it's awesome really hope that it
comes with more clean you want and a
fingerprint scanner and I will be sold
and I do agree I do love the LG g4 but
then again Mia the UI needs to change I
would have wished for fingerprint
scanner and I don't know battery life I
hope they improve the battery life on
the g5 it's only gotten worse since the
g2 and you have a very solid point there
the g2 has been one of the best phablets
out there that wasn't intentionally of
phablets with a great battery life I am
not sure what LG has done to not improve
on that legacy that had brought with the
g2 but then a lot of people complained
about the battery not being removable
back then so i wouldn't mind of LG went
back to a non-removable battery but were
that good that's it for the pocket out
