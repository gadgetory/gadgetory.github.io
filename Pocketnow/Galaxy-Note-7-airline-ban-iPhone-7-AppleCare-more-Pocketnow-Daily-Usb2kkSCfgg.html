Airlines want to take sides Apple makes
some interesting changes to its
applecare+ policy and the lgb 20 starts
prepping for a United States launched
I'm hi Mary vera and with the whole
announcement of Mario reaching iOS I
felt it was only appropriate to wear the
adequate shirt this is parking out daily
official news today begin with deals if
you want to call it that way amazon has
just announced its new Fire HD eight and
even though we don't really care much
about Amazon tablets it's really hard
not to recommend them because this one
is starting at just ninety dollars you
get 16 gigs of storage 1.5 gigs of ram
in all the crazy Amazon ecosystem that's
out there even better Alexa will be
supporting this tablet very soon so for
90 bucks and if you want the 32 gig
variance it 120 that's definitely a
steal other official news come from LG
or should we say US carriers as pretty
much all the major ones have already
announced that they will be carrying the
lgb 20 interesting though is that we
don't really have official dates or
price points we do know that the LG v10
was launched late October for six
hundred dollars on most of these
carriers so I guess this is when we
should expect that and bear in mind we
actually look forward to this phone a
lot it's everything we actually wanted
from LG with the g5 so can't wait now
for those of you that have been waiting
for Android 70 nuga to reach your google
nexus 6p with the irony right well
Huawei has been working on it the
company has pretty much laid flat that
it's been having issues I actually had
to register my phone in the developer
portal to get nougat and I'm not even
sure if I'm running a developer variant
or if I'm running the official one but
I'm running knew it I used it a lot
right now in Berlin given project flies
benefits and it works just fine so
you've got that alternative or you wait
it out from Huawei now Apple has been
making interesting changes to its
applecare+ policy since last year with
the iphone 6s and the past you pay at a
hundred dollars and there was fifty
dollars for changes or repairs in the
case of the iphone success it grew 229
and then $75 / repairs and you get to in
the case of the iphone 7 and going
forward it seems that now you're only
going to pay twenty nine dollars if
either of these two repairs that you're
entitled to our of the display but if
you've got that thing wet or whatever
else it's a hundred dollars instead of
75 it's still a lot better than having
to pay for a swap at Apple for those of
you that didn't know if you're going for
the lower tier iphone it usually
oscillates around 250 to 280 dollars so
you pay a hundred dollars up front and
if something happens you get two years
of warranty to repairs 29 if it's a
display 99 if it's anything else I don't
think it's bad but then again it depends
on the user and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
airlines in Australia and the galaxy
note 7 cuantas along with other airlines
have already issued a statement where
they're asking galaxy note 7 customers
to please turn their phone off while on
flight or not charge it during flight as
well why well my previous job actually
had to do with that before I started
working here in Airlines and the way it
works is that the companies have been
working hard for years over lithium
battery rulings because there have been
a ton of accidents that have been
derived by lilian batteries for those of
you that didn't know lilium is actually
a dangerous good that's dangerous when
wet so yeah it's definitely not the
safest thing obviously in smartphones
what you have is lithium ion it's two
completely different to the ruling that
have existed for airlines in the past
obviously the note 7 for some new things
to worry about hopefully Samsung fixes
this there is the recall I highly
suggest to take advantage of it but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you believe that the measure is overly
dramatic or not from Airlines at least
right now only on Australia but do you
think that it should go forward or do
you think that the company should just
not take it too seriously in my case
after working there so many years I
would tell you this much in the air you
have to be as safe as you can and in the
past you had to turn off your phones
anyways so I don't think it's gonna
pretty much make anybody's lives
miserable leave us a comment down below
