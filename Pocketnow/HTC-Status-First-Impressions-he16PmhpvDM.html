now calm the HTC chacha also known as
the facebook phone or one of the
Facebook phones and there's also the
salsa for the u.s. is called the HTC
status and it's on AT&amp;amp;T in this video
we're going to cover first impressions
of this new interesting device let's get
to it so right from the front of the box
you get to get a sense for how AT&amp;amp;T is
positioning this device kind of these
fun colors this device is made for
younger people social network friendly
people in fact they even left specs off
so 18 th DC are not advertising that
this is a fast phone at this as
cutting-edge graphics and amazing screen
this is all about the social networking
the picture messaging and you know all
the other fun stuff that is associated
with a facebook phone but that's not a
bad thing HTC is building this phone and
HTC doesn't make bad devices so this is
going to be an interesting phone
definitely we've already started
covering the HTC chacha the european
version on pocket now so i'll put a link
up on the video towards the end of this
video so you can jump back and kind of
get an accelerated look at this phone if
it's of interest to you so let's open
this up and here we go here the device
is presented will pop that out and
there's nothing inside the box we're not
going to go in there just the charger
and you don't want to see a charger do
you so let's slide that off first
impression of this device after taking
it out of the boxes wow this keyboard
reminds me a lot of the HTC snap the HTC
snap was a similar device is about two
years ago it came out it ran windows
mobile and it didn't have a touchscreen
unlike these sucks the status and it had
this killer keyboard although this is a
little bit different the keyboard on the
snap was actually staggered whereas this
keyboard is arranged in a grid but it's
also arg anomic lee curved slightly and
these keys are really really nice there
are spaced apart just just the right
amount they have good tactile feedback
they're clicky but not too clicky to
where they're difficult to press really
a key killer keyboard from HTC we've
also got a good layout of buttons here
we've got the shift button the alt
button to get to the numbers facebook
button what
about that later we've got a nice a
d-pad down here in the bottom right
corner which is always a really good
spot and then we've got a call start and
call end key just kind of rare to have
on a phone this whole form factor is
very rare we often do not see a
touchscreen with a front facing QWERTY
so for people that really like the hard
work court to keyboard but still want a
touchscreen this is a good mix we've got
an h vga screen here which is 480 x 320
so kind of low resolution but it's a
small screen you really don't need that
much resolution we've got a front facing
camera here and of course a camera on
the back with a flash really cool
backing here with white on the top and
the bottom of this nice little metal
strip in the center we've got two holes
here they don't look to be for noise
cancellation they're probably part of
the microphone or the extra the antenna
system sliding off the backing here we
get a twelve hundred and thirty million
power battery an on hot swappable two
gigabyte microSD card that comes with it
and of course your SIM card there this
is not a 4g phone or at least it's not
right now it's possible it might be a 4g
phone in terms of hspa+ wants AT&amp;amp;T
upwards of software but it's not being
advertised as such right now it's got
this nice little curve to it which not
only serves a purpose to bring the
screen closer to the user when typing
but when you're on a phone call it feels
really good against your face with this
nice natural curve here and over here
we've got the micro USB port we've got
the volume rocker nicely placed on the
left side 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
power standby button and that is pretty
much it inside we've got an 800
megahertz processor 512 megabytes of RAM
again this is not a device for for power
users necessarily it's for people that
want to be social and have a really good
keyboard and text message a whole lot
you know it's going to be really
interesting is when the developer
community gets ahold of this and brutes
in and we're allowed to or were able to
install stock android on it maybe
overclock the processor a little bit
have a feeling this is going to have
really good battery life so it's going
to have some room to overclock because
of that good battery life so a lot of
cool stuff for for HTC status owners
beyond the basics or the default built
in software speak
the software there's a lot to talk about
HTC has done a lot of really cool
enhancements to make the status a really
cool way to to connect with facebook and
to also do all of the other android
stuff it's running android 2.3 and it's
a pretty fast device actually even
though it has you know an 800 megahertz
processor so we've got a lot more coming
up on the HTC status let us know what
you think of this keyboard and if you've
been really holding out for a device
with a good qwerty keyboard because you
don't find that many of them out there
everything's really on screen these days
and let us know what you think about the
status if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up two thumbs up if you
couldn't know youtube doesn't let you do
that just one thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now
