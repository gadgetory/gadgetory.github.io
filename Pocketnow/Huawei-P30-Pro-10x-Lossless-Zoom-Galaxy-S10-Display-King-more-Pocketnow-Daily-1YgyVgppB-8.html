periscopic camera for the huawei P 30
Pro the Samsung Galaxy S 10 has just
been crowned by display mat as the best
screen for obvious reasons and the elbow
F 11 Pro with a 48 megapixel camera is
now official it looks a lot like the
rumored 1 plus 7 I'm Jaime Rivera and I
was gonna make a joke about snow but
there's actually nothing funny about it
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with a product launches
that I would actually consider deals as
we saw the sony xperia 10 + 10 + /
demlov ec we had a lot of coverage about
it I was actually really impressed with
the phones but I didn't have a price tag
pre-orders have just begun on B&amp;amp;H and
other retailers and we're talking $350
or 430 depending on the configuration
that you look for I know that's crazy
those phones actually we're really good
you can learn more in the description
now start about another sort of deal I
guess we could say as Samsung is
prepping its mid-range err line up to be
just as good or comparable to even it's
flexible lineup you hear about the a 60
which apparently will bring a 32
megapixel camera primary and then a 32
megapixels selfie camera I hope I got
that right
welcome snapdragon 678 gigs of ram like
the specifications are powerful the
device looks really good according to
what we see and we're just waiting to
see when it's gonna launch because we
hear it's gonna be priced very
aggressively now let's talk about the
Oppo F 11 Pro which just got announced
we actually have a reviewed and here let
us know if you want coverage on it
interesting specifications 48 megapixel
camera in addition to other features
it's actually really good looking I like
what I see here but probably the most
important part is that according to the
source this could look a lot like the 1
+ 7 that we've seen in the league so
again let us know if you want some
coverage let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 as we've got official
information that display mate is
grounded as the best display and well
write it shit I'm looking at the
specification that Samsung actually
didn't provide where we hear that it can
go up to 1200 and 15 it's I believe
that's a first
other Galaxy devices has been capable of
so much brightness and we've heard of
everything that Samsung provided and how
the screen adapts to its environment etc
I've been really enjoying it so far I do
feel that it deserves the crown and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with Huawei and the p30 Pro according
to some sources this device was shown
off behind closed doors to certain
people at MWC sadly no I wasn't one of
them and I'm not gonna surprise you
later I haven't seen it but it seems
that the periscopic camera has been
confirmed that we will have variable
optical zoom on this phone just like
what we've seen from Oppo at MWC that's
all great we also hear that
specifications are gonna be powerful and
if the renders and the images we've seen
of this phone are true my god this phone
is gonna be a true looker but let us
know the comments down below I mean what
do you think p30 Pro with all this power
and this versatility and the camera in
this design I mean I think this is gonna
be a hit leave us a comment down below
we love to know your opinion friends
again if you want to get the news early
or follow us I'm talking out our
comments structure both our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one you'd follow me on twitter hina
underscore b that aren't into the ground
at high medley data please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw i'm hind letter than i think so what
you're watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
