accuracy bar down here so hopefully
we're able to shoot this across the
water and it looks as though I did
pretty good on that one so now can
continue with my putter and try to get
it into the hole and it looks as though
there's a little bit of wind so I want
to move my little guy over tiny bit and
now I want to get to twenty-five percent
or so and we'll shoot this ball nebula

our own music to the sound cloud server
and play it over a Wi-Fi or 3G
connection whether duck is a free
application of ill in the windows

move this one down I can block him and
if I'm able to successfully block him
without allowing him to score any points
