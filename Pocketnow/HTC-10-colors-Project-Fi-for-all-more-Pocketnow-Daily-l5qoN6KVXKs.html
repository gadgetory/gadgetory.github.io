available for all and with a sweeter
deal more HTC 10 renders show us some
color options galore and Samsung pay is
now proven to not be as hot as Samsung
wants I'm hi Mary Vera I started today
in a very different continent I am
jet-lagged and it's just smarter to work
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with Oppo those of you
waiting for the r9 or are 9 + that have
been teased the company has made it
official we can expect an event to
happen on March 17 in Beijing and the
Esper specifications were still fumbling
but we do here Snapdragon 820 and at
least one of the variants even though we
also hear contradicting rumors talking
about media tick as well we will keep
you posted as we learn more other
official news move to Samsung those of
you who wonder if Samsung pay is as cool
as the company towns well it is but it
doesn't really sell well as we now hear
that the company has been operating at a
very significant loss 16.8 million to be
exact that it just begs to wonder do any
of you actually use either Samsung pay
or any alternative now a company that's
being extremely smart about getting
bones on your hands right now is one
plus those of you that haven't noticed
there is a new installment plan now
available meaning you could pretty much
pick a 1 + 2 for around twenty two bucks
a month for 18 months which is a really
sweet deal links in the description for
more details on what's available and
speaking of sweet deals google has just
decided to unwrap project 5 for everyone
technically at least meaning you don't
no longer need an invite but the problem
is it is still geographically limited to
certain cities now the cool part is that
if you do choose to get a new phone with
project Phi the Nexus 5x will be
discounted at one hundred and fifty
dollars regardless of the variant which
is a really really good deal if you
think of it and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with the HTC
10 notice I did not say 1m 10 as a we've
got a ton of leaks that have been
working all through the weekend over the
fact that it's not called the 1m 10 over
the fact that it will be just called HTC
10 and that we even get
renders over color options and the color
options look really cool we still debate
if we like the design but hey we'd love
to know your opinion in the comments
down below let us know first of all do
you like the color options to do you
like the design in three what do you
think about that name HTC 10 in my case
I'll wait for it when I see it leave us
