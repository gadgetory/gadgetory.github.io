familiar design Microsoft lays the
ground for the final requirements of
Windows 10 for insiders and privacy
keeps giving Facebook a hard time it
seems I'm high Meadow iveta and if
you're not a fan of Friday's shame on
you this is poking out daily the
official news today start with Microsoft
as we are just a few weeks away from the
windows 10 final release and it just
sent out a memo to the insider program
over the procedures that have to be
followed as first of all the update will
come as every other update for those
using insider program but this will be
completely different for people that
want to buy a computer now and upgrade
to Windows 10 so link to the description
for the full process that you have to
follow in your case of your insider well
you will have to connect your Microsoft
account for this to work but again it'll
come as every other upgrade which is
great you won't have to wipe your
computer and for those of you interested
in a budget iPad which actually those
words don't really match but there was
always the first generation iPad Mini
for those interested in the entry-level
I've had with terrible screen resolution
and for those of you that still wanted
that product for your kids or whatever
welp the product is no longer available
and Apple stores are online Apple has
silently killed it and you know the
other generation iPad you're still there
there are some multitasking features
that are not compatible with these
products with iOS 9 so if you're in the
market for a new iPad I suggest you wait
other official news have sprint sending
one of the biggest ironies like for
example having LTE data and have that be
throttled because of they consider that
you are having high demand of it it is
extremely bad as a practice and after a
TNT got fine for this a few weeks ago
well Sprint has just confirmed that it
will stop doing this which is great
spring is one of the few carriers that
still gives you unlimited data and that
makes sense for you to actually get what
you're paid for they offer LTE you
should get LTE speeds even if you
consume as much as you want now another
company that's facing issues with
governments is Facebook you know the
company's new Facebook moments
application that allows you to
streamline using face detection in a way
to help you share photos
a different way it's a really cool
service that's available in the United
States fryer was an Android but well the
European Union has just stated that they
will not allow the app to work until
facebook gives users the option to opt
in or opt out as a facial recognition
while cool is obviously a privacy
concern something that Facebook deals
with a lot what do you feel about this
service I don't really care about it
anyways and finally for the very
interesting leaks of the day if you
don't want your Galaxy s6 to be set on a
charger half the day because it is
terrible when it comes to battery life
the galaxy s6 edge+ is your option we've
been covering these leagues for the
longest time and we now get some renders
of the device and well it looks exactly
like the galaxy s6 edge and everything
but the microphone hole which is at the
other opposite end of the phone but
that's pretty much the only difference
than everything else yep it is a larger
phone you do hit a larger battery which
is great so again this could be a great
option for those of you wanting a
phablet with this design that does lead
me to the question of the day you have
to choose between the regular size
galaxy s6 are the larger one which one
would you pick in my case battery life
I'd go for the larger one but leave us a
comment down below what is your case and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the Rose earlier before this
video is still make sure you follow us
on fire now calm subscribe try youtube
channel as well you also follow me on
Twitter hi managers quarterly better
