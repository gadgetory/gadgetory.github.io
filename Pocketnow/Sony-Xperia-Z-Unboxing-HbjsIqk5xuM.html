I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and we're about to unbox the Sony Xperia
Z so I rushed home to make sure that I
got home in time so I could be here for
the DHL guy and I'm glad I did
he came shortly after I got home and
this device arrived just moments ago the
Sony Xperia Z which was part of a duo
that was announced by Sony at CES the ZL
and the Z this one has waterproofing and
dust proofing which makes it a little
more durable than its brother however
this one does have a glass back and the
other one doesn't so there is that it's
kind of a trade-off I'd also like to
give a shout out to our friends over at
clove Kota UK who is providing us with
this unit for a review so without
further ado let's get into the unboxing
and see what this device is about so
first you will notice that the box is
nothing special it's just a simple box
no special branding or anything
nothing's particularly awesome about
this box it's just a standard box
nothing too wowing about it but who
cares about the box it's nice but we're
all going to just discard that anyway
we're gonna toss it aside and the good
thing about it is that it opens very
easily
unlike many boxes nowadays this one is
extremely easy to open once you get the
top off the device sits right there at
the top ready to be opened or turned on
whatever but we're gonna wait that comes
later inside the box right beneath the
device is a pack of screen protectors
you get two of them count them to a
microfiber cloth and an applicator with
that so that's neat nice little add-on
there little touch and this insert comes
right out you also have some some
getting started guides quick startup
guides important information and FCC
statement and other information about
device so a little reading material if
that's your thing you also have the
International this is an international
version of the device you have the your
you have a UK plug this does not work
for me I'm in North North Carolina so I
will not be able to use this at all this
is useless to me oh well I've got a
million chargers it's okay
you also get some headphones which is
nice not many devices are coming with
headphones anymore
so it's nice to see these they look nice
there uh probably won't stay in my ears
but they're actually pretty cool-looking
so hopefully those are or decent no hat
I know many of you will be happy with at
least some headphones in the box it's
nice to get a little add-on every now
and then and your standard microUSB
cable that's it
nothing special fancy here so that's
what you get inside the box you get some
headphones a UK charger which is hopeful
if you're in the UK I think that's UK
charger I've never been overseas so I
don't know you get your standard reading
material some screen protectors and the
device so let's sit this stuff aside for
time and take a look at the device
itself because that's why we're all here
so once you get the device out of the
box you'll notice it comes in this
plastic sleeve we're gonna discard that
we don't need that it's not the plastic
so don't get mad at me the plastic is
still on here so we'll get to that in a
minute but once you get the device out
of the box you will get you will see
that it has a 5-inch display on the
front that is a 1080p display so you can
expect a high quality picture it also
has a two point two megapixel
front-facing camera that will record at
1080p this at the bottom is your
microphone and this up at the top is the
earpiece speaker so that's really all
for the front there are no capacitive
our physical buttons the buttons are
actually on-screen buttons so they're
software so the 5-inch display is
actually going to feel more like four
point eight maybe four point seven
because they those are going to take up
screen space so that's something to keep
in mind when you're looking at 5-inch
phones this one's actually gonna
probably feel a little bit smaller than
five inches after you get the power
after you get it powered on because
there are no physical or capacitive
buttons on the top edge here is a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it is under a
cover because this device is waterproof
so it's got gaskets that keep water out
when it is covered that is your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the top on
the side here we have the micro USB port
under a cover as well so that one's
covered up this is your micro SD card
slot also covered up and you have prongs
for apparently what would be a dock for
this device the bottom there isn't
anything except for this hole for a
lanyard
and if you come around to the side you
also have a speaker volume rocker on the
right side and a power button and just
above the power button is another hole
this is a cover for your SIM card slot
there's a SIM tray right in here there
it is put your SIM card in there and
activate the device so that's all for
the edges you have your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack micro USB micro SD
speaker volume power so there is that
for that and once you get to the back
you have a 13.1 megapixel camera with an
LED flash this is your NFC branding
Xperia T and that's about it it is a
glass back and we'll get to that once we
tear the plastic off but let's start
with the front of the device let's get
this close to the microphone and start
peeling that slowly oh there's no sound
very little sound of that at all that's
disappointing there's no sound from the
plastic I've peeled it slow and there's
no sound hopefully there's some on the
back nothing no sound no Michael Fischer
will be upset there's no sound from this
plastic it's more of a flimsy like
laminate than anything it's not really
plastic plastic so no sound sorry
Michael but this is a very actually
beautiful device it's very edgy there's
not a lot of rounded corners it's very
squared and it feels like that in the
hand it feels bigger than it actually is
a lot of devices have a tapered back or
tapered edge that make it feel small
this does not it feels comfortable it
doesn't feel too big but it also feels
bigger than it actually is it feels more
like holding a note then maybe say the
DNA because the DNA had a taper back and
it felt smaller but it was about the
same physical size as this one but on
the back here you have a glass panel so
it is very fragile I guess that's a
downside to some people it is glass I
don't know if this is grille glass and
actually it's not Gorilla Glass it is
strengthened glass it's scratch
resistant and crack resistant glass but
the branding does not say anything about
Gorilla Glass so I think it's something
similar to but not actually Gorilla
Glass so we'll have to see how it stands
the test of time if it stands with
stands drops or anything
we'll see I don't know yet but it is a
glass on the back and glass on the front
and again there is that NFC logo if you
want to see that little closer up I
don't know if we can focus on that try
no focusing I don't know I can't get
that happen just yet
sorry about that we'll see that I'll
take a closer look at that in a review
which will come early next week I
imagine so stay tuned for that but let's
see if this thing will power on I don't
know I haven't used it so I don't know
if it has any power it just vibrated but
nothing happened so there we go it's
gonna power on and we'll compare this to
a couple devices I have laying around
just to see and while I'm at it I might
as well pop in my own SIM card and my
own SD card so I got this thing booted
up with my information on here and let's
take a look at the actual software the
first thing that's really cool about
this is the lockscreen you get all
blinds effect when you run your finger
up and down the lockscreen which is kind
of cool kind of fun to play with a
little bit I did play with a software
just for a few minutes just to see what
everything was about get accustomed to
the software and get a little feel for
how everything works on here first
you'll notice that the icons are totally
customized they're very Sony esque if
you used a Sony television or maybe even
a ps3 you'll notice that these are very
much like other icons you see from Sony
if you tap the applications icon you
open the app drawer and it's very
similar but different to or from
different from the stock Android app
drawer you can uninstall I guess that's
for a mass uninstall share and customize
and if you tap here you get different
orders you can organize your
applications based on different orders
if you pull down the notification shade
you get quick settings at the top here
it's really unobtrusive and kind of blue
as well
I like how it looks you have sound
profiles Bluetooth Wi-Fi mobile data and
a settings shortcut you'll also notice
here that I got this notification after
the phone rebooted it's just blank SD
card that means the micro SDXC card that
I have in here the 64 gigabyte card does
not work it is not compatible with this
device which is upsetting it means that
you cannot use a 64 gigabyte card in
this device and that said you have to
stick to a typical 32 gigabyte card or
smaller so that's a little upsetting but
it's okay another thing about this
device is the colors are extremely
vibrant I don't know if the camera does
it justice at all or even comes close
let's turn this brightness up a little
bit and take a look you can see that
these colors here in the background are
very very crisp and vibrant and one of
the things about this display that was I
guess a little controversy or upsetting
more so at CES was how it's not very it
doesn't have a high contrast ratio the
blacks are not really that black they're
more an inky gray than anything they're
not as dark as you would see on even
like the 1x I have the 1x here and the
blacks as you can see in the
notification shade are just not as black
I don't know how to show you on camera
here but it's just they're they're more
of a light gray than black side-by-side
with even like the Nexus 4 which and you
turn the brightness up on this thing you
can see that the colors just just pop a
lot more on the Xperia C so the the
contrast may not be that great as you
can see here this is a better better
example maybe the navigational buttons
the background on this is more of a gray
and this is just inky black it blends in
with the bezel this one you can
definitely see where the buttons end or
where the display ends and where the
bezel begins this has been a look at the
Sony Xperia Z keep it locked on pocket
now to see more coverage on this device
there'll be a couple comparisons this
week a little more coverage on this
device particularly and a review next
week early next week so keep it locked
on pocket now stay tuned for more
experiencie coverage I'm Taylor Martin
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
