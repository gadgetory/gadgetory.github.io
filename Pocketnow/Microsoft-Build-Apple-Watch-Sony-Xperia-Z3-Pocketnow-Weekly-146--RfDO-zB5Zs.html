entertainment tastes you'll know what
I'm talking about you go to the theater
the usher to your seats you open your
play bill and you find a hastily
enclosed slip of paper saying the part
of Michael Fisher tonight will be played
by understudy Adam doubt you go through
a range of emotions anger confusion
curiosity and then quickly back to anger
Michael will return next week but seeing
as how this is the first in a hundred
and forty five weeks that he was not
able to host the show he wanted to leave
it in the most reliable and experienced
hands he knew they unfortunately did not
answer the phone so he called me all
jokes aside let's get this puppy rolling
LG has a new phone microsoft is building
it build and we're all having a good
time here on the pocket now weekly that
is not the script that I was supposed to
be reading I have lost the script that I
was supposed to be reading and that is
what you get when Ricky macaques make
rookie mistakes so I'm just going to go
ahead and toss it over to Steven Steven
how are you doing today I am all behind
is going off the rails motif we have
going on so far for the podcast you're
also doing this thing for three years
Jesus a hundred not six weeks since
obviously I guess never thought to think
about it this is episode 146 of the
pocket no weekly if you can believe that
and it only took a hundred and forty
five episodes for me to knock off Fisher
and take his spot hi Otto from Indiana
and the only pocket no member that I've
actually ever met in person are you
doing this evening I'm doing good have
been rushing around the city but I am
finally here and able to relax I'm doing
pretty good rushing around the city
shooting footage for reviewers that must
mean that you are a pocket now reviewer
so this this is all good things we're
having we're having some good times here
so let's just go ahead and Stephen if
you could could tell her tell our
viewing audience which is undoubtedly
rapidly plummeting
how they can interact with us on the
show well so the theory anyway is that
we would like you to come and watch us
will we do this live on google hangouts
and you can submit questions in the Q&amp;amp;A
other viewers will upload the ones they
like the best and then we will you know
address those on the air and if we don't
get to yours we always have email you
can write us in and ask questions that
we will try to address on future shows
of course since we're all kind of you
know not having Michael behind the helm
here we're kind of flying by the seat of
our pants here we'll try to remember to
check the Q&amp;amp;A throughout the show I have
a feeling it might slip through the
cracks as we get caught up with
everything I want to talk about but
we're gonna do our best so if you got
something interesting please ask it if
we don't address it send us an email
will do it in a later show but one way
or another we want to hear from you guys
so please participate and just watch us
live I mean the high quality version
later is great but you should be tuning
in now although if you're not already
the sort of call to participate really
isn't helping so hmm well well done
Stephen we got more medium somehow I
don't know you know considering
everything that has happened last Oh two
and a half minutes I'm going to go ahead
and call that well done so now Before we
jump into the news I do have one little
piece of business that we need to
discuss for the past 18 months at my job
I've been encouraged to broaden my
horizons and learn new things and so I
am going to extend the same challenge to
all of our listeners and to challenge
yourself to learn something new with a
free 10-day trial of Linda calm that's
right this podcast is brought to you by
Linda calm and it is used by millions of
people around the world it has over
3,000 courses on topics like web
development photography visual design
and business as well as software
training like Excel WordPress and
photoshop all of their courses are
taught by experts and new courses are
added to the site every week whether you
want to invest in a new hobby ask your
boss for a raise find a new job or
improve upon your current skills in 2015
lynda.com has something for everyone so
give them a look at Linda calm / pocket
now once again that's ly and DA calm /
pocketnow do we have like I know linda
has sponsored us in the past do we have
like a contractual obligation with LD
West that only Michael I mean king of
the suspender holster only Michael can
promote the LD West holster and we're
not allowed to make sure that if he's
not the one behind it well I mean I
would not be surprised much done every
show so I mean that would be a pretty
easy cut contract to fulfill but no
Ashley as it turns out it's just Linda's
turn so we appreciate Linda as much as
we appreciate our friends from Canada
god bless so um so I guess there was
some news happening this week huh now I
just want to give her so this week
nothing actually happened I know it was
crazy it was dead I mean I don't even
know what we're gonna talk about for the
next next time he minutes
what I do know is that Michael and
friends spent about an hour on the high
seas just a couple of days ago
discussing the LG g4 everything you
could possibly want to know about that
phone is in episode number 145 of the
pocket now weekly we're going to talk
just real briefly I just want to ping
the other folks here on the podcast and
see if they have any impressions of the
LG g4 but we're just going that's going
to be a little like a little on the
light side today so let's start with you
hi Otto what did you think about the LG
g4 I really like it so far it's the
camera looks fantastic which i think is
one of the biggest things that most
manufacturers need to start you know
working on more and more with their
phones so camera looks really good
screen from what i hear is fantastic
Steven you got a hands-on with it so I'm
sure you know that better than either of
us but looks really nice yeah I was
happy with what I saw I only got to play
with it briefly as we we shot some pics
for the hands-on video but the camera
interface was fantastic the the manual
mode lots of on-screen adjustments
really easy to reach I don't know about
how the imaging performance is going to
hold up at least we did some early tests
and we push this thing hard in all
fairness we were checking out the raw
mode in the the full resolution and
zooming in all the way on that we could
see some color noise here and there but
again this was you know an early test
and we really did not know what we were
doing just sort of diving right in so I
think this needs some more in-depth
analysis but it felt great I don't mind
the shape that's a little more angular
than the the g3 was only have to briefly
look at the leatherbacks but they were
definitely very attractive I don't know
if I want to feel that seam down the
middle the whole time and I am still not
quite used to the the rear control thing
but that I'm sure is super easy to get
used to but it's an attractive offering
i'll give LG that and i like how they're
slowly moving this uh the the g series
launch event earlier and earlier in the
year and next year i wonder if it's
finally going to be you know because the
week after week we're gonna get the one
m10 galaxy s7 and the g5 one after
another that will be interesting that
would be something but i think there's
one thing that
that we haven't mentioned yet that our
listeners will probably particularly
enjoy and that's the removable battery
and the micro SD storage which both of
the other flagships that we've seen this
year droplet at all so I mean that that
could that could be a big thing for LG
that in and of itself but I'm not really
convinced about the whole zipper up the
back thing maybe that's just me it seems
it seems very 2010 dallin but I don't
know one thing about the battery that I
didn't get to mention in the hands-on
and I not sure if LG mentioned at the
actual launch event the company said how
it was going to make a big push towards
but you know the idea of removable
battery sounds great if a man who
actually has a second battery they're
carrying around ready to swap in when
the first one dies it's very you like
know the options there but I question
how many people actually do this but LG
said it's really going to encourage
people to be buying these second
batteries and it might have some
promotional deals or something where it
makes them available but it really wants
people to get behind this idea of you
can you know in just a matter of seconds
swap the phone out with a full fully
charged battery ready to go and with
wireless not i mean the supports there
but wireless charging isn't built in the
same way it is with like the galaxy s6
that that could be a big deal towards
making this thing a you have phones will
last you through day and night topic of
a weekend debate just a couple of
weekends ago actually um so let's uh
let's move on from LG because like i
said they they talk the they talk back
home to get those days ago man right I
know let's that's crazy so let's let's
just go ahead and dive into the rundown
Microsoft has had a little bit of news
this week Steven you want us to want to
walk us through that yeah build kicked
off the two three days ago now it's a
few day conference and they have lots of
individual seminars a pair of keynote
addresses on two different days but the
main event was but is yesterday a multi
losing track of these things yeah I
think yesterday yesterday Microsoft
shared a bunch of stuff that started off
kind of Deb heavy and I mean this is a
deaf event that's what we expected but
they said wait into some of the more
commercially accessible things it showed
off some new features for
Windows 10 from this is again for the
dev side but it's very relevant to us
because it could mean a lot broader app
availability what Microsoft is going to
do is make it super easy for developers
of Android and iOS apps to port their
existing software over to windows 10
cell in the Windows Store so users on
PCs tablets and phones can i'll buy
these and use them on their Microsoft
devices this isn't quite the the sort of
Android emulations as we've seen like
blackberry play with where its unique a
side load existing apks it's a little
more hands-on than that but Microsoft is
making it very easy for devs to take
their code load it into Microsoft's
tools and with just some you know
tweaking on the edges here and there
develop software that can be sold in the
windows store without having to start
from scratch so there's going to be like
an Android backbone underneath the
windows tens shiny Microsoft exterior
that's going to let these apps to work
with very little customization and I
know you know considering the high or
the high effort to develop for Windows
Phone apps in the first place and the
low number of users that sort of
discouraging developers in the past
reporting so this in making the bar of
entry as low as possible is a really big
deal are these promises in theory but I
mean you know they they always say you
could pour it over your apps with
minimal effort and I just wonder how you
know minimal actually is cuz I mean I'm
not a developer I don't even play one on
TV but it seems to me there's nothing in
development that's minimal I mean I work
for a software developer and and and you
know the minimal things that we try to
roll out into an upper a usually take
you know weeks so I'm not sure hi an
idea you don't have any real coding
experience but do you have an opinion on
the the minimality of the effort in
porting Joel on here yeah we should get
jail this is a joe topic no I yeah I
have no coding background but uh well
yeah fair enough okay like what you hear
it it sounds really great and it sounds
it sounds like Microsoft
really expending the effort to get more
apps into their platform by whatever
means necessary and that's going to be a
win for for windows man and v2 the
mobile things are just half of the
equation here Microsoft is also making
it easy to bring existing win32 NetApp's
to Windows 10 I mean of course you have
to have background support there but
also it's going to allow developers who
do web-based stuff to package their apps
and sell it through the windows store
they can in app purchases and things
that you normally wouldn't always get
from a web app platform so there's a lot
of different ways they're making easy to
bring content to the platform right and
and like I said that's that's going to
spell a win for the users at the end of
the day at least we hope so let's just
let's just hope for the best and let's
hope Microsoft knows what they're doing
as far as that's concerned I didn't get
to it today in the news but they
released a new video about showing how
easy it is to port this so really we
should have watched that before doing
this but well well check out a check out
yeah well maybe there's an editorial in
there somewhere so but in the meantime
I'm going to call upon my fellow
Spartans and we're going to talk about
the death of the Spartan and long live
the long live the edge browser so
Stephen what's going on let's go on with
his edge thing yeah I mean a project
sparking is Microsoft's new browser
effort for Windows 10 going to be
replacing the long-standing Internet
Explorer you can explore will still be
there for you know apps that are
services that really require this and
this has been a thorn and I east side
for the longest time you know companies
holding on to ie seven eight all these
deprecated versions because they have
these internal services that absolutely
rely on ie support so i use not going
away but it's being replaced whereas the
primary browser at least by spartan
we've already gotten to play with it
with a pc preview of a few weeks back it
arrived in the latest Windows Phone
Windows 10 preview and now it has a
formal launch name it's going to be the
Microsoft edge browser which I kind of
suspect Microsoft just really likes the
idea of having a Big E as the icon for
its browser and it had Jepsen really
this from a PR perspective alone it's
got to have that e because that's what
people click on the big blue
be yeah when grandma goes to check her
email she gets the e on the desktop
that's what she knows seriously so I'm
not a bi how my mom actually checks her
email she only knows to look recognize
the the browser icon on the desktop
there yeah well you're you're probably
talking about thirty percent of Windows
users in the world here so I mean I
definitely do not agree with or I don't
disagree i should say with the
rebranding of the web browser i did like
the name spartan i thought that was a
pretty cool name but at the end of the
day if it's gonna be Microsoft edge then
then as Microsoft realized it was going
halo with everything I mean Cortana and
then Spartan it's fun but I I'm a
concerned that might have made the
companies seem like I mean Microsoft it
makes all its money on it working with
business client server stuff Azure and
it needs to seem I mean it tries to
reject the stodgy image once in a while
but maybe it felt like it was going too
far into this gaming thing and wanted to
do in class things up yeah I mean from a
from a tech support background I'm i
have i'm going to have nightmares about
trying to explain to people yeah
openedge no no not the edge of the
screen the edge browser the you know
you're just gonna end up calling it the
big blue e so i think at the end of the
day it really doesn't matter what the
name is but i guess i can't think of a
better name at this point so i guess
we're just going to kind of run with
that for now moving on what's uh what's
next in the list we have Microsoft
continuum which sounds a lot like
continuity but is it continuity it's
continuum and it has to use which is
always fun so what is continuum either
one of you can jump in on this one good
I know it is my baby alright Steven
continuum go didn't you above this is
okay continuum something that
Microsoft's been talking about since
Windows Windows 10 first was announced
last fall it's a technically summer but
the big news here is about continuum for
phones and what this means for users who
want to take their smartphones and try a
transitioning to a more desktop
experience when it suits their needs
it's an idea that
it's been in the smartphone world for a
while here that you could take your
phone I mean it's essentially a computer
it has all of the has tons of RAM these
days lots of storage speedy processors
by all analyses this should be as
powerful as a at least powerful is like
those little Intel HDMI sticks that can
plug into a TV and turn it into a
computer so why not plug your phone into
the TV the idea is you hook your
smartphone up to a monitor attached some
peripherals keyboard mouse over
Bluetooth and then you have a full
desktop experience but it's being
powered by your smartphone now this is
going to exist with Windows 10 devices
you're not going to be able to use it
with existing Lumia models that upgrade
to Windows 10 this is something that's
going to require specific hardware to
pull off but that will be coming in time
and it looks really really promising um
it's not quite because its hardware
isn't available yet Microsoft had to do
a simulated demo but it looks really
polished you attach the phone to the
monitor it pops up with the app too
thanks to the universal app second part
of Windows 10 you get a desktop looking
at the UI isn't just a smartphone screen
stretched out it looks like it would on
a proper PC and you can also kinda have
screen doubling you can have Stubing
stuff on your phone with the phone UI at
the same time you're working with this
desktop UI on the monitor hugely
ambitious I haven't seen anyone pull
this off in a way that's streamlined
that users want to use it doesn't
require a lot of expensive new hardware
and it's very well might happen we're
going to be paying attention next couple
months to see if Microsoft really makes
this work as well as it promises to well
that's pretty cool and you know on the
one hand a lot of what this sounds like
is the the the break between Windows 7
and Windows 8 when when when Windows 8
Phone started coming out microsoft said
basically the same thing that the
hardware in the old phones wasn't going
to be compatible with you know the the
new windows 8 stuff that was coming out
so that's why they pushed out windows
seven point eight which left off like a
lot of the NFC
stuff and now i'm going to say the same
thing here that I said that back then is
how can how dare they not ship out NFC
coils to you know manually solder into
the back of our windows seven phones
we're going to be doing that right and
you know the same thing here is you know
how dare you not not ship out updated
processors so that we can connect our
window or my lumia 920 do I keep
thinking about are there any windows
phone models that currently have
hardware hdmi out I don't I know like I
don't know of any of us on my hand so
tell or something but at the same time I
love this idea I love the idea of taking
your phone and setting it down and
connecting a of a keyboard and a mouse
and a monitor and just let the phone be
the box I mean that's really all you
have to do you have all your local
storage right in fact I think this was
the subject of another I don't know if
it's a weekend debate but it was an
editorial that I wrote about a
windows-based padfone which is not
dissimilar to what we're talking about
here where you take the phone you plug
it into a tablet and it becomes a tablet
you take the tablet you plug into a
keyboard it comes a laptop I because
it's it's not dissimilar here so I'm
going to go ahead and take credit for
this so hi Otto do you have a whole lot
of windows experience in and building
upon that would you ever use your phone
as a as a netbook if you will well I
don't I don't have much experience with
windows on the desktop i have used
Windows Phone quite a bit in the past
and I really like the interface really
the big thing that's kept me from
switching from Android to Windows Phone
is pretty much the same thing I feel
like the same reason for most people is
just the the apps are just not quite
there in comparison but no I love the
idea I feel like this is what I feel
like this is what Microsoft has been
sort of wanting to do with Windows Phone
for the very beginning is you know make
it as similar to the desktop as possible
so that way once you introduce a feature
like this you know it's it's hopefully
pretty seamless pretty easy and
everything should hopefully just you
know blend right in together I just
wonder how many people are going to get
the hardware
in their homes really take advantage of
this I mean I guess it makes sense if
you're connecting to a TV but if you
need the keyboard the mouse like a
desktop sighs computer monitor it's
gonna seem a little weird sitting around
with Lily nothing attached to it most
time sure you come home you can drop
your your phone in I guess we'll see
cradles and things to make the the
process super easy but it's gonna be
weird like unused hardware that most of
the time has nothing two to drive it do
you think people will really set stuff
like that up I think it's got a lot like
like the ramen community on Android
where it's really not something that
most people are gonna buy an android for
just the way that most people are not
going to buy I windows fell for this
feature but you know the power users
that want it it's gonna be cool to have
I heard that as ramen feature when you
first set it and got really hungry and
excited all at the same time oh let's
not talk about food i'm still remember
at indian cuisine from earlier today uh
so in general yeah i think is that
definitely the type of thing i don't
think people are going to seek out
windows phones just so they could say
yeah i can take it to a hotel and use a
laptop at the same time it's one of
those have it but not need it type
things which is which is pretty cool and
speaking of having it but not needing it
but before we move on though I can see
that right possibly being big for
businesses I mean I'm certainly people
who have if they take their laptops
around at work they'll have a monitor
keyboard stuff you put it in the docking
station exact same thing where you just
carry your primary device with you and
plug it in or ever there's no station
where you need it so in certain use
cases this could be big and I think it's
definitely an evolving technology and
it's an evolving culture as well so
there's going to be it's gonna be a lot
of work a lot of a lot of effort a lot
of a lot of nose to the grindstone and
I'm out of analogy so we're just going
to go ahead and move on to the Giant the
giant hallo helmet as i like to call it
or the microsoft the return of the
hollow lens so hi Otto I'm gonna throw
this one over to you did you do your
homework do you know what's going on
with this I really have not had much
time that's kind of why I'm quiet right
now is I've been trying to read all this
stuff I've been busy with a couple
videos
watching this whole presentation was not
a lot of blood I mean I I got out of at
the end but there was so much Azure
cloud coding at the beginning yeah
you're excused for not back evening up
with this well to be fair I didn't know
much about it until i got the rundown so
but anyway so all right so Stephen you
can pin apps to the wall from what I
understand is that is that what's going
on here yeah Microsoft brought out
hollow lens again we saw this a couple
months back at the was a late January
event when we first were introduced to
the hardware but it was still pretty
rough around the edges this time it was
a lot closer to I think the final
experience we're going to get we had
users out on stage wearing the thing
completely untethered they're walking
around that's it's the device it's
scanning the environment it's getting
its building an augmented reality map of
the room and then it allows them to take
these regular windows 10 apps you're not
going to need anything special for
hollow lens and they can view it in a
window I mean it's called windows after
all you it in a window that can sort of
be pinned up to walls and he sort of
stays there like a a real poster or
something would on a wall on your house
you could walk around come back to it
you can just take a command and the
hollow lens will then have the app the
window pop off the wall and follow
behind you so it's an interesting merger
of the the window desktop environment
we're familiar with and something closer
to actual physical windows and it's all
very interesting and compelling and we
went to play with this for ourselves and
that's also one of the big things here
is a Microsoft brought along hololens
units for these steps to try out of
bills we're going to be getting a lot of
first-hand reports probably in the ages
and weeks to come also showed off some
cool ways you can interact with Internet
of Things devices had a little robot on
stage but the key bit there was how I
doesn't you don't need to have every
device in your house having a full
spatial awareness because it comes to
piggyback off the hololens the hollow
lens develops this 3d sense of where
everything is and then you can relay
that information to other devices so
they can cut down on their complexity
and that raises for debility and all
sorts of good things that will make
Internet
things as exciting as it promises to be
yeah that didn't seem really cool they I
think they specifically mentioned if i
remember correctly they were talking
about you could have a like a robot that
would use the data collected by the
hollow lens and they would actually be
able to navigate the room without having
me its own onboard sensors so that's
that seems pretty that seems pretty
sweet and I just III don't think I'm
alone here when I say I want r2d2 to
serve me drinks and so I follow lens can
get me closer to that I'm on board are
you what I was causing trouble you what
c-3po he's a good a bedient droid now
that's true but he is whiny hmm so when
I was at CES earlier this year just my
last day I was just kind of wandering
around and I saw this little booth with
a robot that was kind of fenced-in to
the to the display area and the the
entire purpose of the robot was this you
can you can add different different
modules to him to make him do different
things of course you buy those and uh
yes sir assuming we're that's where
they're gonna get most of their money
but the one that they were demonstrating
the feature they were demonstrating was
that the little robot can go to a mini
fridge you can add an attachment to your
fridge to where he can he can grab a
soda can bring it straight to you he
hands it to you does a little spin and
he you know goes about on his way didn't
they have that exact same I swear to God
there was a drink serving of robot and
revenge the Nerds does anybody remember
that yeah yeah we've been waiting for
this for a while thank god it's finally
happening thank you thank you my future
Oh 25 years so then the next thing in
our rundown it's our it's actually our
last piece of Microsoft news um I'm not
excited about this at all oh I don't
know I don't know if you guys are
excited about that I mean Stephen do you
wanna give us like 30 seconds on this
office add-ins thing because I honestly
didn't even know office had Adams I
never use them do you use Microsoft
Office a lot are you a microsoft office
like a ton but what uber I don't know I
was not I'm an open office guy i did not
even aware of this functionality but yes
you can apparently add-in
it's like they're plugins to office that
can either be for like industrial
purposes and be a company has a good way
it likes its forms prepared it has a
plug-in that makes it super easy maybe
it's something that helps you search
through all your documents you organize
them better but third parties can add
this functionality office in the past
that's been for the the pc desktop
version of office but as office grows to
be in the cloud on tablets and things
doesn't make much sense for these atoms
to only work with one version so when
Windows 10 and office 2016 the add-ins I
keep on calling the plugins or add-ons a
dinner function across all these
platform lines what works in the PC work
on the iPad vice versa yadda yadda if
you use them before they're going to get
better if you didn't care them up before
you're still not gonna care about them
that's about it I think this is
fantastic news for people that are not
on this podcast so let's go ahead and
move on uh so the Apple watch might not
be so nice on the iphone's battery so
there was a lot of I'm just gonna go
ahead run with this one because why not
because the apple the Apple watch has
taken some criticism that its battery
life wasn't all that great well now it
turns out that it might that might be a
transmittable disease over to the iPhone
itself because it seems that the eye of
the I the Apple watch I keep lying to
call the i watch the Apple watch app
seems to not be so kind to the iphones
to the iphone's battery there were some
reports saying that the iphone was
performing great because they never had
to look at the screen it was all on the
watch but then there are other users
that were complaining about battery life
on the iphone and it would seems to
possibly be due to this iphone companion
app that makes the watch go so i think
that's I that sounds bad it sounds bad I
think it's a little bit too early to
tell I think the software you can always
try to improve management in the future
I don't think it says a deal-breaker
necessarily right now i know i know we
none of us here really have experience
with the Apple watch except for me who
stayed up til 230 warm the other day
which is the fur
style i can say that in the wild nice
mom but i mean i know i know at least hi
Otto and I have experience with
wearables in general now I haven't
noticed any type of drop off when it
comes to performance at least with
either Android wear or with pebble hi
Otto have you seen any type of have you
noticed any performance issues like that
with your with your own phones batteries
with a wearable connected I have a
little bit it's nothing terribly
noticeable but you know typically if I
have my moto 360 connected to a phone it
usually ends up being like a five or ten
percent decrease overall which is it up
and sort of what you'd expect I'm
curious though do you guys normally keep
Bluetooth enabled on your phones because
okay yeah when I don't even when I don't
have all that I'm using it yeah even
when I don't have a watch I keep
bluetooth on I don't know why I probably
shouldn't actually but I mean my car's
bluetooth and I've got a lot of like
portable Bluetooth speakers that I use
so it kind of makes sense for me to
leave it on all the time so it kind of
depends on your your own individual use
case but um but yeah I mean in general I
would think that that the loss of
battery life would probably made up for
in the fact that you don't look at your
phone as often um I mean I go hours and
hours at a time which granted sounds
really bad but I mean I go hours at a
time without actually looking at my
phone because you know I've got all the
notifications coming to my watch I don't
you sound really bad not down sounds it
sounds bad in a social way like you know
I don't know it just yeah it's just done
yeah but anyway um so as it turns out
it's it's really too early to tell I
think so the Apple you know will
definitely keep an eye on the story and
see what what the Apple watch does with
iphone batteries in the long term
especially with our own unit and I'm
sure that's a detail that Michael will
be paying particular attention to
another detail that he'll be paying
attention to is this taptic engine that
is included with the watch but it seems
that that's um that's not exactly a
blowing up a lot of skirts recently
isn't that right Steven I have no idea
what that's supposed to mean
well it's that it's a the taptic engine
is uh is I guess is faulty on some some
Apple watches that were being produced
so we've heard the taptic engine is the
the tap haptic feedback component of the
Apple watch that makes it vibrate it
makes it you know the touch force touch
for stocks that you can tap on the phone
you know transmitted app to your friend
the taptic engine is the receiver part
that generates the motion that they end
up feeling and rather than a little
weight on the end of a motor that spins
around and like a vibrator in the phone
this thing has a little weight that
slides back and forth so it can create a
linear motion and reportedly there were
problems with this that it wasn't
functioning as intended but supposedly
none of these faulty ones ever ended up
reaching distribution channels it may
have impacted availability to an extent
which may be why you're having trouble
finding an Apple watch or your shipments
taking a little bit longer to get to you
then you would have liked but it doesn't
seem like it's something that us and
users should be too worried about okay
alright well that's that's that's that's
that's a relief because there's another
they're actually getting the taptic
engine from two different distributors
if I if I remember correctly so what
they did was they kind of kick the kick
the one to the curb and told the other
one you're gonna have to double your
production hope that's not a problem
good job it's very that's what they call
a diversified portfolio of equipment may
I don't actually I don't know if that's
what they call it or not but that's what
they should call let's go with that yeah
so we're going to go with their
diversified portfolio nidek it looks
like is the is the company that's
ramping up production to make up for the
for the failures that of the other
taptic engines and we just had one
little last piece of apple news i'll go
ahead and grab onto this one because
this is probably about as interesting as
the office add-ins one but it seems that
siri is is getting a bit of a makeover
so that's nice it's interesting because
Syria was probably the the first
the first voice assistant you know the
one that really you know put voice
assistance on the map I guess would be
would be fair to say and since then it's
like Apple puts took Syria out of the
box said hey everybody here's Siri put
her down and then completely forgot that
she existed because there hasn't been a
whole lot of advancement in the in the
in serie since she debuted what for 34
years ago something like that and so now
it seems that they are updating they are
updating Siri they're giving her a whole
new back-end component which is a it's
it's it's this system called me so
switch is used by Twitter and ebay and
you know if you can tweet about it and
you can buy it used it's gotta be good
makeover is the right word for this
because it doesn't sound like anything
on the the user facing side is going to
change this is like you said all backend
stuff that will improve series
responsiveness and ability to scale with
users but you won't notice anything it's
not going to start responding to your
queries differently we did see some news
about that or least rumors with Apple
supposedly patenting this feature that
would make Siri a little more
conversational in its tone I think it
was about driving directions how it
would give you more contextual stuff
like instead of turn left in 500 feet
because who can picture how far Python
defeat is to any accuracy it's like look
for the orange building up on your right
and you know look out for that and make
your turn Ben so that was there could be
some changes to how you interact with
Siri but separate from this upgrade now
in all fairness I am a geocacher so i
can actually asked to make 500 feet
pretty well but anyway I mean that
proves the rule yeah so uh but in
general I think they're trying to make
Siri better you know which is a good
thing their house will bless their
little hearts because you know Google
now and Cortana are pretty much wiping
the floor with Siri at least as as far
as I'm concerned so and we Amazon's
working on with Amazon if somebody's
working on their own sort of Siri knock
off and nobody have one of these guys
they've got that uh that Emma's
the pedestal thing that yeah thnkx Oh
Prosecco that's what it is I take it
where yeah you can find something else I
don't know but is it sits like a thing
it's like a Serie it actually looks a
lot like this and you sits on a table
and you ask it you know how many cups
are in the court and it says usually
goes our song but anyway so that's
pretty much does it for does it for
Apple and we do have some non LG g4
stuff to talk about starting with Sony
uh Steven what's going on with Sony
sales there it looks maybe like it's not
so good well they haven't been selling a
lot more phones that have in the past in
the mobile industry as in pretty much
every industry growth is the word and if
you're not out doing yourself on a
yearly basis you are failing and that's
pretty much what Sony did this past year
is it sold just about as many phones as
it did the year before now we see you
know quarterly changes have more phones
and the holiday time and all and sort of
this dry spell in the late winter early
spring but year-round it really didn't
make much of a dent the problem though
is what Sony sees happening in this
coming year in that rather than things
staying the same or even getting better
it only expects them to go down now this
isn't necessarily a capital B bad thing
because Sony seems like it wants this to
happen it's going to stop trying to sell
as many phones as they had in the past
but it wants to have the phones and it
does sell bringing more money for the
company so that's going to see it move
away from not that it already had a huge
lineup of budget phones with very slim
margins to begin with but supposedly
it's going to sell fewer of those
concentrating more on the more
profitable models like flagship Xperia
z4 but it's still tough forecasting a
drop of like twenty three percent which
is not insubstantial I think it added up
to 89 million fewer phones over the
course of the year so it I don't know if
somebody's may be considering backing
away from phones entirely a few years
from now whether this trend continues
it's not it doesn't give me a lot of
hope
I'll say that right right but but I mean
there is a there is some news that that
comes off of that about the z4 in the z3
plus is it that's kind of uh that's yeah
yeah yeah well it's a plus so plus means
better right doesn't even it should or
bigger you never know with smartphones
its max mean more memories max mean
phablet size with this plus mean bigger
battery yeah yeah yeah so buck adopt but
so we heard that the that the Sun easy
for was coming to Japan only if I
remember correctly but now there seems
to be rumors that there's going to be a
z3 plus which may or may not be the same
thing as the z4 but for a world market
weird that so many good things this way
I mean obviously it has to release a
flagship for international markets and
with it I'll be the z4 or something or
the z4 under a different name or
something very similar same internals
maybe Sully different aesthetics we
don't know and the latest idea is that
it would be the z3 plus and I know the
specifics on this rumor here and unless
we heard they talked about maybe a
launched in May so hopefully we'll get
the truth about this soon but I don't
like the idea of I mean I know that
these the z2 z3 another z4 haven't been
the the you just differences between
them they're very iterative steps and so
many upgrading components here and there
but I like idea of branding this thing
in the same family as the z3 is going to
be confusing to shoppers yeah absolutely
uh but at the same time you know if
they're now it was there an announcement
about the z4 maybe hi Otto can speak to
this as well because I honest the cz for
stuff went completely by me because you
know I work for a lot in Japan exactly
now was there an announcement from about
the z4 that said specifically it's it's
Japan or bust or I mean did they leave
that open or how did that how did that
go down exactly why why would we be
looking at a z3 plus worldwide with a z4
in Japan only does does that make sense
to either one of you
I was running announcements about when I
saw the best release for the z4 I didn't
see anything specifically saying
specifically saying it would only be
going to Japan yeah but at the same time
that's the only place they have said
that it's coming so we really don't know
what's going on that's right so so it
just falls into the general weird
category i think is what we're what
we're all pretty much in agreement on
there and then but it turns out that
despite declining sales for sony
smartphones or at least mart phones
thats a sony on them what about the
smart phones that have sony in them this
is the great thing about being a big
conglomerate being a samsung and LG or a
Sony your smartphones aren't selling
that good maybe your dishwashers are and
your bottom line is still nice Sony its
phones may not be flying off the shelves
but the parts that it makes sure go into
a lot of other popular phones and
specifically we're talking about the
imaging modules the camera sensors that
appear in all sorts of phones from if
there's a smartphone from a manufacturer
and they're specifically naming who's
making the camera sensor in it nine
times out of ten if you're calling it
out it's because it's a sony sensor and
sometimes apparently making cash in this
hand over foot so even if it's not you
know succeeding in the whole phone arena
as well as it would might like to it can
still do okay helping other people and
it's like samsung making screens for
devices or fabricating chips for apple
it's you make money off other or
microsoft and its patents and getting
money from eunice android phones its
everyone makes a little money from
somebody else it's a little less sexy
but you know it it fills up the bank
accounts so i guess no problems with
exactly and and if as long as we're
keeping the coffers full i think that's
really what's important especially if
we're it happened to work for Sony so
let's see moving on we've got some new
names for some Samsung devices I'm not
sure why this is really exciting but
let's do so many news stories a day some
exciting as other
is but they're interesting God darn it
all right well let's you know let we've
got actually a couple of different a
couple of different Samsung rumors here
so why don't we just go ahead and talk
about them and see what's going on
what's up with this new code name for
the note 5 well obviously we'll be
getting a note 5 sometime later this
year presumably around IFA in early
September we haven't heard much about
the devices hardware so far besides the
fact that Mike had this stupid I res not
quite I guess it's for K class but 38
something by 20 something ultra HD
screen stupid in a good way I take it is
there any other kind well not according
to my wife um but they don't covered
some mmm I feel like I was cutting
someone off there no continue uh we
found some model numbers that look like
they're going to be for the in the note
5 is sort of follow in the same scheme
and building off with a note for was and
tied them we've also come up with a code
name project no bowl of course this is
not how the phone will launch you'll be
the galaxy note 5 unless something
radical happens inside Samsung and
everyone goes crazy but will probably be
hearing this name a little over the next
few months as leaks mention it we start
learning more about the actual hardware
capabilities uh and also we heard some
of pick up some news about model numbers
and look like they could be something
galaxy s6 see they are the SMG 928
series devices they had the suffixes
that show these are coming to multiple
carriers both US International and 928
we haven't seen before but the 920 is
the galaxy s6 the 925 is the galaxy s6
edge so it's not a huge stretch of
imagination that the 928 will be
something like that what it is though no
one really seems to know and I guess my
instinct went to this could be another
active especially with the galaxy s6 not
formally waterproof and we had heard a
little bit about possible plans for an
active including some really exciting
rumors that could bring back microSD
expansion but I believe we had a model
number tied to that already it wasn't
yes so I left with those strong guess of
what this could be I would love to see
an galaxy s6 active personally I mean I
was really excited when the s5 came out
being waterproof kind of a yeah the SI
the South being waterproof was qui
efforts active wasn't that exciting not
like ps4 it was yeah and I was I was
disappointed to find out that the Essex
was not waterproof cuz you know I'm an
outdoorsy kind of person I you know I'm
outside during the summer and you know
cuz i live in chicago so during the
winter I'm never outside if at all
possible e um but you know during the
summer spring fall i'm outside as much
as I'm inside you know when I I'm not
sleeping i should say so I mean I love
the fact i love the idea of a rugged
phone that could stand up to you know
being stuck out in the rain or being
dropped into a puddle or something like
that so I would be excited to see a
galaxy galaxy s6 active I believe we've
seen some promising results from
informal like it's not informal but
non-official waterproofing test me
people have submitted the galaxy s6 to
torture beyond what it should be able to
survive and it sounds like it's doing
okay even without capital w
waterproofing so you very okay getting
the rain on it but oak Oh none let's not
let's not go too far they're all right
so what do we got next in our in our
rundown oh the the s6 and the RAM
Stephen tell us about the s6 and what
it's doing with its Ram s6 galathea 6
has quite a bit of RAM 3 gigabytes which
is about as much as you can expect from
your average flagship at the mind we are
seeing four but none of the big
manufacturers have gotten behind that
with their their hero devices so with a
3g Quebec device you would think that
the phone could kind of let apps go
crazy they can stay in the background
doesn't have to kill them because you're
not going to you know run though on RAM
when you start multitasking while that's
the way you assume this might work
apparently that hasn't exactly been the
case for the galaxy s6 and you just have
seen the phone aggressively managing
available ram to the point that is
removing apps from ram when there's it
doesn't appear to be a reason why it
should like it's trying to keep more
space free than actually needs to uh it
sounds
annoying but not at all like something
that Samsung couldn't fix if this is a
bug if this is an intended operation
this seems like exactly sort of thing
we'll see addressed in the future
firmware upgrade so I wouldn't lose too
much sleep over this hi Otto your uh you
know you're you're a device reviewer so
you're you're no stranger to putting
phones and other devices through their
numerous stress tests does samsung have
a point here is there it does samsung or
is it is this a good thing that they
might be you know kind of hovering over
the diner just waiting to grab their
plate just as soon as I that last bit a
bit of fish I don't think so something I
always tell people at my day job selling
phones is to uh yeah everybody always
asks do i need to use these task killers
and you know all those different apps
that are all generally doing the same
essential purpose of just wiping
everything off your phone and I usually
tell people to just not use those
because they end up closing too many
apps that don't need closing and then
the system has to reopen them it just it
yeah but flip side to that I find myself
manually closing apps all the time not
because I'm worried about available RAM
or performance but because every once in
a while I'll go to pick up my phone at
the end of the day and I'm a relatively
light user I'm here like Adams that I'm
not checking my phone constantly
especially when I'm at my office and get
my emails and everything my desktop but
yeah I'm used to having like you know
eighty seventy percent battery life at
left at the end of the day every once in
a while though it'll be down at like 30
cuz there's one app that I went away
from and it kept running in the
background and it ate like eighty
percent of my battery so I'm always
aggressively killing them just so they
don't run in and run down the battery
now say I do it just because I'm OCD I
don't like heavy and you know what this
is I'm like the anti palm user
considered and I grew up loving webos
and the cards and everything like that I
never kept cards that I wasn't using I
always dismissed it when people are like
your best see my boy and I'm just like I
know but why I'm not using them so let's
just get rid of it so I guess I maybe
I'm a little bit on samsung side in this
particular case you know you're not
using it
out of here we don't need you we don't
want you here we don't we don't serve
your kind here especially when they say
in a really stupid voice like this yeah
what accent is that supposed to be I
don't even know but it's it's it's it's
a it's a it's a punk accent is what it
is it's a pizza yeah we we don't need
you here anyway maybe it's at it could
be a Chicago accent for all I know but
anyway so yeah I guess I'm kind of on
samsung side and and hi Otto is not and
I can get I we don't even know this is
what it's supposed to be doing this
could very well be glitchy operation and
doesn't seem to be affecting everyone so
this might be like an edge case no pun
intended that will be addressed right
right but I mean moving on to to
brighter things the one app that I do
love to have running all the time as
Google now and it looks like Google now
is uh is expanding its functionality
even more than how awesome it already is
so what do we got here we got some we
got some new stuff that it's deal with
these days is that right yeah you're
going to start seeing new cards from a
lot of third-party apps that integrate
with now and allow you to pull up
information from them right through nows
interface google started making
available an API earlier this year and
now i think in fact 7d apps that can
take advantage of this all sorts of
things from like a reservation hotel
making stuff to restaurant reviews to
music it's just gonna make the now
experienced a lot richer and we're going
to see this list of supported apps keep
growing in the months to come so and in
the meantime google is sucking your
privacy right out the window so cuz now
is going to know what I music i'm
listening to and i can't deal with that
so anyway I'm just came so but yeah so
that there's actually a whole list of
there's actually a whole list of new
apps if you go to the source link of
this particular we're not going to get
into all of them they're Spotify I think
there's ober open tables in their mom
but I know Stephen we're coming up on a
hard stop for you so we're just gonna
get to our one last present you that
you're looking at the clock because I
wasn't huh yeah so speaking of time
how's that for a segue we got a high
and high-end Android wear device coming
now let's uh let's hear all about this
steven and we'll let you go after that
yeah we heard was like a month or so ago
tag heuer luxury watch manufacturer was
rumored to be developing a SmartWatch
and we got the announcement than a
couple the next day after the rumor
landed but it was super light on details
it's a tag heuer Google and Intel are
creating this SmartWatch and just didn't
say anything after that so it was I mean
it's exciting because it's going to be a
luxury brand and especially with the
Apple watch out now that's a market
that's pretty much untapped in the the
Android wear field so we got the big
news back then was confirmation that yes
this is an Android wear device and not
some exotic Samsung ties anything and
now we got the new detail that
supposedly this thing is going to sell
for about fourteen hundred dollars which
is clearly more expensive than all the
Android wear devices out there it's not
nearly a sky high though as the apple
watch edition 5,000 with 10,000 starting
for that yeah 10,000 starting price you
could you could buy 10 you could buy 10
of those and still not say looking
stuffers just give them what looks
expensive Apple watch but still it's
pretty pricey for for an Android wear
device so I'm sorry oh by all means
probably comparable to instead of the
apple watch edition may be getting the
normal Apple watch the steel one with a
real fancy a link strap on there because
what you're going to get this is the the
shell that exists for it I already about
their tag heuer model regular watch and
they're just gonna like take the frame
of that rip out all them nice little
gears and in the jeweled operation thing
they're put in an LCD screen put in an
Intel processor and this is going to be
it's gonna look like a regular watch
that's what it is on the outside but
have a you know LCD screen and it's
going to operate with Android devices we
had I think you have some log info
they're talking about this fall october
or november so it's still quite a ways
out but this could be one of the more
attractive Android wear devices to come
around this
holiday season especially when you
consider that it'll be working with your
android device but it'll be working for
quite a long time with your Android
device 40 hours of battery life that I'm
gonna do that especially based on an
existing walks design it's going i mean
regular watches by and large are a lot
slimmer than smartwatches so i don't
know where they're shoving that battery
but right i mean 40 hours that's that's
that's pretty crazy i mean i think i
think hi Otto and I have both
experienced the oh my god my phone my
watch is down to ten percent I need to
hurry home type of situation the train
can't move fast enough in those
particular cases but but 40 hours I mean
and I think it also opens up the the
floor for a general discussion about you
know the the battery life of
smartwatches I don't want to get too
deep into it but I know since hi Otto
and I have both had the the Moto 360 and
a couple of other wearables hi Anna
where are you when it comes to like
battery life of a watch are you a
multi-day person or I suggest are you
okay with a one day with a one-day
performance my battery my watch never
lasts me pass today um I don't
necessarily mind that but I would
definitely like to not have to worry
about charging it every single night
which is why I'm looking forward to
getting the pebble time steel once that
comes out oh it's gonna be very nice
Steven did have you you haven't had any
wearables as far as I know uh Martian
which just has a little less mana
regular water right last for quite a
while but you're not getting anywhere
it's just like a notification watch
you're not getting any apps or proper
Android wear stuff so that lasts a while
but that's because it's not so much ok I
did you just pull out like it like a
Casio me a Casio watch Mickey Mouse or
at least a Mickey Mouse watch or
something so alright Steven I'm not
going to keep you any longer because I
know you need to you need to scurry so
before you go why don't you tell
everybody where they can hear from you
on twitter which helped by the way
happened twice last week you've tweeted
two times in a single day i was
impressed so where can we find you on
the on the on the on the internets
stephen shank at twitter.com those go at
Stephen shank on the on the twitter i do
i do Twitter's you are a social media
maven Stephen well I thank you for for
coming on and walking us through the
through the news because we we couldn't
have done it without you so sorry I
can't stick around longer but I'm sure
you guys are going to knock out these
reader emails so yeah we're gonna we're
gonna have some good time talking to the
readers so that'll be that'll be fun I
will let you go do your do your stuff so
thank you thank you very much Steven
take it easy fellas please zoom in
alright hi Otto so we are going to now
ordinarily at this point in the show we
would look over at the Q&amp;amp;A section and
see what's going on over there but hang
else has abandoned us and we don't have
a Q&amp;amp;A section maybe users are posting to
it and probably most of those cues are
who is this guy and where is Michael but
we don't see it I don't know why I'm
very sorry listeners with it's awesome
that you're tuning in and watching us
but we can't we can't see any of your
any of your questions and comments so
we're just going to go straight into
listener mail we have three pieces that
we chose hi Otto I'm going to go ahead
and grab the first one I want you to be
ready to get the the second one so the
first piece of email we have comes from
Tim I'm gonna go with kuja k uja tea and
it says dear pocket now to enjoy the
podcast love all the input down to the
point of the email I love this brevity
it's it's wonderful me and my friends
also all got the HTC one m7 when it came
out phone still grade but they have
lollipop update and I don't my friends
are on sprint and that have terrible
service but they have timely updates I'm
on Verizon I have great service but my
updates are insanely slow so which would
you rather have great service and a
terrible update times or terrible
service and quick updates hi Otto I
throw it to you I would honestly i would
i would take the former i'd much rather
have better service and and stick with
the software that's already give
to me I've always I've always gone of
the assumption you should never really
expect updates on your phone just
because no matter how much they carry or
manufacturer will promise the update
it's not necessarily gonna happen and
even if it does it's probably projected
time schedule so I I would always go
with service over over the software on
my phone absolutely true and I'm
definitely on the same page I mean it
doesn't matter if I have lollipop if I
can't make a freaking phone call sorry
or if I can't surf the internet or
whatever and not to mention I learned
back in my days with palm never buy a
phone based on what they promise it will
do buy it for what it does right now so
I think it's actually a pretty a pretty
quick answer for us a you know
definitely get you know get the
reliability of the service first if you
get the software update that's a bonus
so at least that's where we that's where
we stand Tim thanks for writing in and
Hyatt oh I'm gonna throw it to you yeah
this next one comes from Greg vote who
was nice enough to let us know how you
pronounce his last name since it's
spelled a little bit differently than i
would have thought vote would be it says
in the next month or so i'll be
purchasing my first android phone and
have decided on the galaxy alpha which
i'll be buying used and using on AT&amp;amp;T
next next work next week i'm assuming
the question i have is which version
should i buy should i get the AT&amp;amp;T
version that's designed to work on att's
next network next work net work I'm
thinking network I'm thinking about
supposed to be network and that's just
really bad autocorrect yes so he's
wanting to know if he should get the
AT&amp;amp;T model or get the international
version which has no carrier bloat and
other features like download Booster as
well as an unlocked bootloader so that
he can deal with custom roms in the
future thank you in advance for your
input on this decision Greg vote set
from my blackberry 10 smartphone I think
that's the actually most important part
I'm period of the email there that he's
coming from a blackberry and these
enemies moving over to the galaxy alpha
so where do you
you stand on this particular issue hi
Otto I think the galaxy elf is a good
phone I don't know that it's exactly the
number one phone i'd recommend right now
especially on a TNT's network where they
have a lot of good phones to choose from
but it's still a it's a great phone it's
really nice size and I'm assuming that's
probably one of the reasons why Greg is
wanting to get the alpha versus
something like the bigger s6 or the note
series arm so especially if you're
coming from a blackberry 10 I feel like
and and this being your first Android
you're probably not going to notice any
of the huge differences between
something like say the galaxy alpha and
again one of the newer and faster phones
like the s6 I think it should you know
be a good choice what about
international vs 18t that one really i
would say at the i would say the biggest
buying decision with that since he
mentioned custom roms and the unlock
bootloader on the international version
um if he thinks that routing and
throwing roms on there is gonna be
something important to him then
obviously the international version is
gonna be the only way to go unless the
unless somebody's unlocked the
bootloader in the ett model and i just
don't know about it um if you I if you
don't care about routing I would
definitely say just to get the one
that's made for your carrier you're
gonna have the best service and the best
compatibility that way yeah and also I
also wonder how how willing AT&amp;amp;T would
be to service a device that is you know
meant for international like if anything
should happen to it if it starts to
malfunction or whatever are you gonna
have to go with Samsung's tech support
on that one or it can you take at your
local AT&amp;amp;T store um and I personally
think that I've never custom robbed so
you know I'm definitely not an authority
on this particular subject but I get the
feeling that custom roms are are very
much one of those things that really
sounds like a cool thing to try until
you actually try to do it and then you
realize well this is a major pain and I
never want to do this again um and that
could just be me I don't know there's
probably Android people that are
screaming at their screens right now
saying I'm a moron and I'm not gonna
argue with you but yeah personally I
think I'm i would probably if it were me
if I'm making this buying decision
myself I'm gonna go with the ATT variant
just because like you said it's it's
it's made for the network and I think at
the end of the day I'm not worried about
that much bloatware although it is a
samsung device so uh you know maybe we
want to keep as much of that off as
possible but I I gotta go with the AT&amp;amp;T
version yeah does the nice thing to keep
in mind is that if the if the bloatware
bothers you that badly you can always
you know either hide it or disable it or
sometimes even uninstall it so it's not
the other world if it has a couple of
extra apps on there right right so yeah
so I'm thinking our consensus is let's
go with let's go with AT&amp;amp;T mr. vote and
you can get off that blackberry unless
of course you enjoy it in which case man
you just keep on keeping on all right so
this next piece of of mail comes from
Paul Stevenson it says hi Michael and
Steven neither which are actually on the
podcast right now sorry about that every
phone is a compromise as we know and
every podcast is a compromise as well
what feature is at the top of your
shopping list an absolute must for your
next personal phone and why tough ain't
it me Qi charging baby I put in the baby
part but hoping I'm predicting a new
feature for the 2015 Moto X great job
guys kind regards so hi Otto what is at
the top of your list and actually we had
a poll um about this very question not
too long ago but but what's at the
what's at the top of your smartphone
shopping list for me probably the
biggest thing is just good battery life
I was inclined to say speakers and I
just wrote piece on that a couple of
days ago I really like having great
speakers on my phone because yes you can
always use headphones or external
speakers but at the end of the day you
know you're not always gonna be using
those and I like to watch youtube videos
friends and co-workers and that's it's
nice to have good speakers for that but
the even even though the speakers on my
on my m9 are really nice the bad
life is not as good as some other phones
and speakers don't really do much good
if your bet if your phone dies while
you're trying to use it so if this is
very true so um okay good I was gonna
say the alcatel idol 3 um actually kind
of gives me both of those it's got
really good battery life and actually
very good speakers but and I see like
five plus hours of screen on time for
that pump yeah yeah five and a half is
the best I've gotten so far wow that's
pretty that's pretty nice i actually
tweeted to one of the one of the guys at
alcatel i said you missed an opportunity
with the idol because i actually
designed a logo that that says i do L
but it was it said the same thing upside
down so if you like turn the logo upside
down about such an idol I just like such
a missed opportunity but actually I'm I
would actually love to get my hands on
that alcatel phone one of these days but
um the the one the one question I
actually had about the alcatel idol
which actually segways nice way into my
answer this question is how's the camera
on that on that phone it's you know it
given the price tag it's not terrible
you have you have to keep in mind it's a
two hundred fifty dollar phone sure so
it's not terrible but it's also not that
it's definitely the weakest point of the
phone okay all right well that's that's
that's good to know because in my
particular case the camera is one of the
first things that I'm gonna look at now
I don't really know why this is just a
little you know Adam doubt insider I'm
not much of a photographer um you know I
I I don't have a very good I when it
comes to photographs and I always seem
to miss the moment but I just I I want
to have a great camera experience if at
all possible because I want it to make
up for my flaws and so I take a ton of
pictures of my kids and I take a bunch
of pictures of like stuff that I find
that's funny and I posted on Instagram
all the time and I just I want a camera
that makes up for the fact that I kind
of suck at it I mean I don't think
that's too much to ask so for me a
camera is is number one on my list I'll
plug in a phone if I have to
you know in regards to the Qi charging
although I I think I'm very well
documented when I say I love cheat
charging but yeah when it comes to
everything at the end of the day I'm
looking for a solid camera experience
and everything else is secondary to me
so I guess following that you'd have to
give it to like performance you know
maybe is like a close second would be
performance you know there's no point in
having a great camera if you can't use
the phone because it's a laggy piece but
I guess yeah that's just kind of how I
that's just kind of how I look at it so
what's my curiosity hi Anna what's
what's number two on your list after you
after you get good battery life no
number two after the battery life is
definitely the speakers um definitely
speakers I really like to have a nice
camera but at the same time for the past
three years now I've carried HTC one's
and moto X's and I've dealt with really
terrible cameras lowers the bar a little
bit doesn't it okay I'm pretty used to
do you know trading that away for in
exchange for good speakers so okay well
and I know that you're a bit of an audio
file and you know you you're into the
music scene so I could definitely see
how that would be that would be
important to you so you know we actually
blasted through all three of those
emails really quickly and so as it turns
out I did actually grab a fourth one
just in case perfect I just need to find
it here it would have come from the sea
in keeping with your love of brevity is
this the one no that's not the one oh
gosh where did I put this last one I
emailed it to you too high you know so
you check your email two three no I
emailed you one not there it is oh here
we go here we go project pride well
we're talking about project fee right
yeah so okay so project I think it's I
think it's Phi not fee yes yeah this
email comes from Andrew kuntz who was
also nice enough to provide a this is an
inside joke listeners so but he was nice
enough to provide the pronunciation of
his last name I personally wouldn't have
gone there but man that'd be awkward
wait so this email says
hey pocket down team longtime listener
first-time writing in so one of the main
selling points of project Phi is the
ability of your Nexus 6 to seamlessly
transition from wireless towers to Wi-Fi
connections depending on which
connection is better my question is does
better mean stronger connection or
faster connection love everything you
guys are doing keep it up yada yada yada
that's literally what the email says
yada yada yada you guys are great Andrew
Andrew Coons just like the author um now
if I had I I don't know specifically and
I actually there's very little details
about project Phi out there now so I
don't think that we could really speak
with any authority on here but what i
can do is as a customer experience
designer because that's kind of look at
what i do on my day job how I interpret
better would mean a stronger more
reliable connection it doesn't matter to
me if you have a super fast connection
is going to be dropping out all the time
and I think that actually kind of
defeats the purpose of project Phi if
you have a super fast connection that's
dropping out what's the point of
seamlessly switching back and forth so
if it were me and if I were making that
decision I would make it with the
stronger more reliable connection what
about you hiya so for my understanding
it's actually not related to your your
internet access is so your internet
access at all it's um it's actually
switching between your your wireless
network and the Wi-Fi for phone calls if
I oh okay that looks great so it's it's
all just Wi-Fi calling basically and and
a problem with Wi-Fi calling on t-mobile
and on sprint is that if you make a
Wi-Fi call and then you leave that Wi-Fi
network the call will drop instead of
switching to your cellular network so
project 5 will not do exactly so it's
basically just supposed to make sure you
don't drop your signal you don't have
any you don't have any kind of reduced
signal or quality or anything so I would
say also stronger connection is the the
end goal here okay yeah so I mean at the
end of the day it probably doesn't take
a super fast connection to make it well
actually maybe it does too
make a Wi-Fi call but yes you definitely
want to be stronger because otherwise
you're going to be bouncing back and
forth that's going to be a bad
experience overall so i'll tell you what
andrew we will keep our eye on this and
as more details emerge we will be
certain to report them to you but for
the moment I think we're going to go
with I'm sorry I just glanced again in
the signature for the moment we're going
to know with the with the stronger
connection not the faster connection and
maybe we'll get to the the signature and
b-roll but I certainly hope not uh but
anyway I think we got we got all the
news of the week we got we got the LG g4
we've got microsoft build we've got
apple we covered the whole spectrum here
we got four pieces of listener mail
that's right kind of what's coming for
right there and so I think that is going
to start to wrap up the show did you
have any final thoughts for us I ought
to or no I did not okay well then I'm
going to go ahead and say that's going
to do it for this episode of the pocket
not wheelie weekly produced by Jules
