pocket now
and in this video we're going to cover
the hardware of the HTC Touch pro one of
the most highly anticipated devices of
this year in the Windows Mobile space I
first want to talk about the size of the
device now when it was first announced
with the touch diamond earlier this year
a lot of people were disgruntled about
how thick this was going to be and
indeed it is thick but I'll tell you
what guys this device does not feel
thick it's thin in the hand because it's
not very wide and it's not very tall
compared to its Big Brother the Titan 2
or the Kaiser in the pocket it doesn't
feel big in the hand it doesn't feel big
the only time when you've got kind of
sense that it's actually very thick is
when it's sitting on a table top like so
or it's sitting out in front of you and
you look at a profile shot of it but
beyond that it doesn't feel that big
okay so let's open up the keyboard and
of course the screen is going to turn on
and we'll talk more about the software
later and what we have here is a five
row QWERTY keypad and it's really great
that HTC has included a full number pad
at the top here because usually what you
have to do on these sort of devices to
get you know five six five you would
have to do function this number function
that number kind of like you would do on
the you know Kizer so a really great
keyboard and even though these keys are
smaller than they are on the Titan Tour
the Kaiser they feel really feel really
nice and I think this keyboard may
actually be better than that on the
motorola q9h which is considered to have
the best keyboard of any windows mobile
device so let's close the slider over
here on the side we have a volume up and
down button and here it says HTC
innovation going to the bottom we have
HTC's proprietary Jack and there's a
soft reset hole and if you remember on
the diamond the software set hole was
behind the stylus so this is a much
better place for it we have a microphone
there going over to the other side
there's nothing here except for this
except for the stylus which as you
remember from the diamond is has a
magnet at the end so if I kind of put it
slightly in it'll pull itself all the
way in and when you remove the stylus it
turns on the screen and takes it out of
standby mode and of course it's stuck in
landscape because I just had it in
landscape and what's interesting and I
don't know if the touch diamond also
exhibits this the entire backing of this
phone is magnetic look at this I don't
know what the purpose of that is or if
it was done on purpose but it's kind of
interesting okay so let's flip over to
the top we have a power and standby
button now one of the differences
between this device and the touch
diamond is that it has a microSD slot so
if we remove the back cover and before I
do I want to mention that this coating
is kind of the rubbery soft coating that
you find on the xcalibur or a lot of
other devices I know on the touch
diamond it was a shiny plastic which you
know didn't make it feel as good in hand
but they replaced it on the touch pro so
to open the back you kind of slide it up
it's very easy and on the back here we
have the micro SD slot and this is hot
swappable so you don't have to turn off
the device to take out the card and you
can take it out and put it back in while
the device is on and flip it back around
to the other side and access music or
movies or anything like that here we
have the camera sensor and the the flash
and of course the slot for your SIM card
turning back to the other side and of
course the phone went on we have let me
get a little bit closer so you can see
these buttons on the front and as you
can see the device is an absolute
fingerprint magnet hold on one second
I'm going to clean it off for you okay
that's a bit better and I recommend that
you use the included screen protector so
that you avoid getting so many smudges
on this thing so here we have some
buttons we have a home button which will
take you back to the the touchflo 3d
screen we have a back button which also
doubles as an OK button in many screens
there's a call and a call start button
and all of these aren't touch sensitive
except for some things about the d-pad
I'll talk about that in a second you
actually have to press them down and you
get a little bit of tactile feedback
which is good look at the fingerprint it
just left its pretty amazing in the
center we have a d-pad but it doesn't
few interesting things in some
applications like the photo browser
to opera mobile if you run your finger
along the outside it will zoom in an app
which is a nice feature also if you're
in a text message or if you're in an
email doing this motion will make the
text bigger or smaller which is good
this button in the center actually has
some touch sensitivity if you are in the
camera application to focus the lens you
tap it with your finger but don't press
it down all the way and then to take the
picture you press inward just as if it
were a standard d-pad moving along to
the top we have a front-facing video
camera for those that can use it and we
have a speaker and a status light here I
should also mention that there are many
different kind of status light
configurations that go on down here when
you're charging it it looks like it's
filling up when you have a new call it
blinks when it's on standby
you can probably see it if I hold it for
a second it when it's on standby it
blinks like it does there so that's a
really interesting innovation that you
don't see on too many windows mobile
devices so in summary the hardware on
the touch pro is well done there's one
issue that I found and you're not going
to be able to perceive this over the
video but there's a little bit of play
in the keyboard when you push it up and
down I can actually feel it move
slightly up and down maybe you can see
it in the video but I mean for a device
that's this expensive I don't want any
sort of keyboard play that that implies
bad quality because h DC makes good
devices and that's really not acceptable
so that's pretty much it for the
hardware on the HTC touch pro in the
next video we're going to turn this on
and talk about all the interesting
features and how the integration with
the keyboard works and everything like
that so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
