pocket now pocket cast we are now on not
only itunes but also zune so you can
download the pocket casts in many
different ways that we're really excited
about that so on our call today we've
got my permanent copilot here Evan glass
Evan say hi hey guys hey Brandon hey hey
and we've also got Tony who just came in
from Spain after being out at Mobile
World Congress which were going to talk
a lot about say hi Tony hey guys hey
Brandon hey Evan and let's let's start
there Tony general thoughts on mobile
world congress what did you think about
it well it was a first for me and I can
compare it only to the coverages which
we had in the past and saying that I
might say that it was quite a successful
MVC I've got plenty of thoughts on
surprises on let downs on success
stories but generally speaking it was it
was a good show get here so let's let's
jump right into that what was the
biggest surprise of Mobile World
Congress Evan um I thought the biggest
surprise well first of all I should say
unfortunately that there weren't that
many surprises in and you know where we
as as bloggers and journalists were part
of that because you know we'd basically
sort of leaked everything beforehand so
there weren't all that many I can't
think of almost any products that that
we didn't know about ahead of time
except maybe the the name of the Xperia
Pro so so I would say the biggest
surprise was the fact that we didn't see
anything really high-end from HTC I can
talk about that a little bit more later
but we were really expecting to see them
the the pyramid or the hd2 or whatever
it's going to be called you know they're
they're dual-core device that they have
in the pipeline and the fact that we
didn't see it that was pretty surprising
to me yeah we're going to talk more
about that indeed Tony biggest surprise
of Mobile World Congress well it's not
the biggest surprise as Evan said we
knew everything before the MVC but let's
not talk about devices for the neck
10 seconds for me the biggest surprise
was Stephen Ballmer's keynote and the
announcements which where he said that
features which will come to Windows
Phone 7 will be pretty pretty good so
for me the biggest surprise was
microsoft keynote I gotta go with you on
that Tony I was not expecting there to
be so much information coming out of
Microsoft in fact we were talking on the
site about how you know where's
Microsoft this year with with their with
their hardware or any sort of
announcements but you know he talked
about the mango update with the ie9
integration and the new way of of
multitasking with the you know the press
and hold of the back button to bring up
like a card like view so I concur there
wasn't expecting that I don't think
anyone was expecting so much information
out of Microsoft what else was part of
that announcement for Mango so we have
fan of apps Twitter integration with
winter integration People Hub ie9 I 9
gaming improvements uh-huh and that was
pretty much it yeah there's going to be
a time with Kinect apparently that looks
like it's gonna be kind of cool hmm yep
the time of connect for me though I
would love to go back to Windows Phone 7
right now I'm on Android but I can't do
it because it still feels like an iPhone
first generation having to go back to
the home screen to change apps it's just
ridiculous and the back button is so
limited in its functionality to take you
to a previous app it's just it's messy
all right so that next let's talk about
the biggest winner of Mobile World
Congress whether it was a device or
company Tony what do you think was the
biggest winner I think it was a company
and its cold LG we heard about the
optimus 2x and the optimus black with
the occasion of CES so it was really
down to the optimus 3d and having a 3d a
glasses-free 3d smartphone on display
was was great and on the same note i
should say that there was also another
3d smartphone which was the links 3d
which nobody seemed to mention but
taking that putting that aside I think
the biggest surprise the
winner surprise was was LG let me ask
you a question about LG Tony how is
their build quality it's been a while
since I played with an LG device well
i'm using the optima 7 as my daily
driver and I've got some serious hands
on with all the LG devices on display at
MVC and I think they are they're coming
up right on par with HTC really well
yeah that's a that's pretty impressive I
didn't I wasn't under that impression I
thought that they were sort of just
accelerating these products to market
for getting out of the water quality not
at all they're so solid there's no
squeaking sounds the materials used are
top-notch so bill qualities good to hear
kadir and i have an biggest winner
before Congress um I think that the
biggest well I don't know if you would
you would say this with this was
necessarily at Mobile World Congress but
in the same time frame I thought
Microsoft getting nokia on board for
them is just huge and so so if you
consider that Mobile World Congress then
then microsoft and windows 17 were
definitely the big where's very good
yeah that's a huge win for both sides
there for the biggest winner I would
have to say sony ericsson came forth
with a portfolio of android phones and
it wasn't it wasn't that long ago when
we were writing sony ericsson off as a
player in android when they had the
xperia x10 which was running old
software he was slow it took a long time
to come to the u.s. and it finally seems
that they're kicking up the the gears
and releasing new hardware hopefully
it'll actually land on carriers around
here but the play is coming to verizon
relatively soon is March the time frame
of enters it may I think it's April
April so right in between there very
good okay next thing about Mobile World
Congress biggest disappointment Evan
start with you um well as usual I
thought not as usual but you know
the CES and now Mobile World Congress is
two shows in a row that that HTC really
hasn't come through with any exciting
hardware all we had in this show was two
phones that you know we were really
expecting which was the desire s and the
incredible ass and you know nothing
really exciting there and then also the
Wildfire s which you know another
mid-range handset and then to other
phones which which did give something
different but but not different in a way
that that I think most of our readers
are interested in which is these these
Facebook buttons which you know for for
a segment of the population and and for
the market I think that that they will
they will have some you know that they
will have some popularity but but for
for people who want high-end phones HTC
really didn't just didn't come through
yet and like I said before there there
was no pyramid there was nothing to a
poor nothing bigger than you know
foreign screams or wvga and it just
wasn't really that exciting yeah I've
got I've got a side with you on that and
I was looking more into the salsa and
the chacha which is of course HTC's
Facebook phones they kind of had a
really interesting function with the
Facebook button that's more than just
taking you to the facebook app when you
are in a screen where you can share
something some sort of content whether
it's a song or a website or a picture
the facebook button actually glows so
then you know that this is something
that you can share it's kind of an
interesting idea I think it's kind of a
going to be a novelty for a lot of
people and I agree with you have an HTC
disappointed we we were expecting every
year we expect from them something
amazing last year we have the desire HD
and the legend which are the first sort
of unibody phones with a new version of
sense that was truly different and then
they brought forth these you no point in
one upgrade phones with a slightly new
version of sense and
it was just it was underwhelming Tony
what do you think biggest disappointment
well I think I have to agree with you
and I think I'll have to agree with
everybody saying that HTC was the
biggest letdown and not only because
we've had the remakes the S series for
the incredible and wildfire which are
pretty much the same internals in
another box taker leave the 8 megapixel
camera and the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera on the incredible s
but the biggest let down inside HTC was
that they were not allowing us to have
any hands-on action with with the
Facebook phones they've had it on
display but they were closed in a glass
box it was like a HTC got word that I &amp;amp;
Q is releasing the facebook phone and
they had to do something with it but I
get the feeling that it was unfinished
hardware unfinished software and it's
it's the same with the flyer tablet
which they had so as far as I'm
concerned with no hands on possibility
no pricing no availability these devices
are still a rumor for me yeah that a
capital R rumor a location yeah capital
R capital are definitely well they're
they're coming to the US the salsa and
the cha-cha I guess HTC and eighty
thinks that Americans are more Facebook
obsessed than people in other countries
but ok let's move on finally about
Mobile World Congress what phone do you
guys want to buy that came out of Mobile
World Congress let's start with Evan oh
I'm think I'm most looking forward to
the optimus 3d not only because it's
supposed to be you know smoking
benchmarks so far but just the fact that
that you can both record and playback 3d
content on the same device i think is
pretty intriguing so so just for the
novelty alone I'm excited about that but
you know even if that wasn't there it's
supposed to be a pretty a pretty smokin
device yeah Tony tell us more about
before you answer the question tell us
about how realistic the 3d
well on a penis it really is they had
some demo videos which were playing on
on the screen like I think I captured
the one with the occasion of the
hands-on with the parachuters jumping
out of the airplane it's it's really
really great I mean you have that
cinematic 3d feeling when you look at
the content it's not the same when you
record your own 3d video I mean you can
see that it's recorded with a smartphone
camera you have free d all right but
it's not that standing out jumping out
of the screen 3d but if you have content
which was professionally recorded and
sync to your device it's fantastic it
just blows out so so when you record the
3d from the phone with the dual lenses
it's not as captivating as the
pre-existing content is somewhat right
yeah it's it it's somehow washed out
like like you're used to recordings with
your smartphone interesting and it's so
hard to imagine 3d on a smartphone is
there anything else you can tell us
about it that would make us understand
what it's like well it's like when you
sit in with the with the your glasses at
the cinema at imax and you see let's
take a video no let's take a game
because they had also some games on
display you have that depth of field you
can see you can see your enemies coming
out from from around the corner even if
they're far away which which you cannot
really see on a 2d to the display let me
ask you this I saw a glasses-free TV at
CES and it was it was ok it was the
technology is not there yet for a bigger
display you have to stand exactly one
spot the resolution was very low did you
have any of that sort of problem with
the optimus 3d where he is so you have
to look at it to regulate on you have to
be directly in front of it with a
certain viewing angle take or leave a
few degrees in an angle but I've got
something I don't know if it's if it's
the display or if it's my eyes because
about five or ten minutes after watching
the 3d content on the optimus 3d my eyes
hurt so maybe it's the free
see or maybe it's my eyes I don't know
but it was the same with the with the
links 3d too so I guess it's my eyes men
that really just proves that these these
phones with 3d aren't ready for
primetime yet I mean when you shoot a 3d
video or you're watching a 3d movie
you're going to want to share it with
people and if you can only have one or
two people directly in the line of sight
I mean it's it's kind of silly yeah well
LG will tell you that you can hook it up
via HDMI to your big screen 3d TV and
you can share it that way so they have
an answer for that too as far as I'm
concerned 3d on a smartphone is more
like a gimmick we're not there yet so I
don't think if there will be a demand on
the markets except those typical excuse
me fanboys who will buy something just
for the sake of it just for the novelty
so you're saying that LG thinks that if
you buy an lg tv as an accessory to
their smartphone they'll work in tandem
just right yep it's it's the same with
your tablet i mean the tablet also
records 3d content but it cannot
playback 3d content on its own screen
and while you can play it back on the
optimus 3d you have another feeling when
you played back hoots to your 3d TV very
good very good so so Tony which which
phone would you want to buy obviously
the optimus 3d so yeah it rocks both
display wise because the display is also
when you get out of the 3d content and
you get into the typical Android
interface which is 2d of course it's
it's vibrant it has contrast and of
course it's it's kicking some real
competition but with the quadrant score
right right right I'm gonna have to
stray from the pack here I'm not
impressed with really any of the phones
I'm looking at my little cheat sheet
here and I'd have to go with the galaxy
s2 because AMOLED Super AMOLED at 4
inches is awesome on the Nexus S on the
Galaxy S 4.3 inches super amoled plus
this thing might have the awesomest
screen ever it's going to be fast it's
going to be probably as thin as the
xperia arc from sony ericsson
even thinner yeah thinner thinner yeah
so that's the phone that I'm not rude it
take off touchwiz put on stalked Android
and you've got yourself a pretty good
thing he Brandon Kenny lived with a
device which is feather-light weight
because the galaxy s2 is you can barely
feel it in your hands it's so thin and
it's so lightweight that you're holding
like two pieces of papers in your hand
does it feel cheap though um no it feels
I don't know how to explain this like
like you're holding something which
should be heavier unsubstantial right
that's the word unsubstantial hmm yeah
that's an interesting point because you
would think that people would tend to
want light phones but truth is that when
you have a heavier phone it feels more
significant more substantial Evan wasn't
the LG expo extremely heavy yeah I've
had a couple phones that were real that
were like that the xperia x1 was the
same way now that thing was a little
tank yeah so I personally know Monta you
know a phone that that weighs a little
bit more you know especially if they're
going to have some some metal in it and
some you know higher-end components and
materials yeah definitely I mean heavier
to me means more complexity and maybe
that's just in my head like the the
inspire 4G which I'm still using as a
daily driver it is it is heavy but it's
it's also made out of metal and glass
and it's got a big screen and I'm
thinking how complex it must be inside
to run all these components and I don't
know I guess it's just a matter of
perception so let's let's move on from
Mobile World Congress over overall we
were we were relatively underwhelmed
CTIA is around the corner Evans going to
be there and hopefully we'll see
something higher end from everyone
especially HTC with the with the pyramid
that we've been we've been hearing about
and talking about and maybe we'll get
some hands-on with the Facebook phones
maybe we'll finally get some hands-on
with cha-cha and salsa
so let's move on so this week it
happened several times it even happened
yesterday android 3.0 honeycomb or at
least the emulator sdk version the
pre-release was ported to the droid
incredible the desire HD the evo 4g and
now the nexus one and the question here
is you know once honeycomb is released
and it's all the source code is out
there it's going to be able to be ported
to every android phone that you can
think of as long as it's rooted so
people out there that have a rooted
phone will have the opportunity to run
the tablet version of android on their
phone and a question then I'm proposing
is is honeycomb for tablets a good
option for for phones I think it has
certain elements that are definitely
conducive to to to any size device
really and i also i'm not sure that that
the question is quite right the people
who are putting this on our are you know
the people who want the latest and
greatest you know the the stuff that's
that's unreleased just coming out the
same way that I used to flash my my
windows mobile devices you know every
couple days it's just fun I don't think
that that people who are on the cutting
edge necessarily are looking for their
phones to have the same functionality as
as stock builds or more more mature and
more polished roms so so people aren't
necessarily using these to have the most
functional version of honeycomb but they
you know they want to try out some of
the features and and for that I think
it's great good point good point yeah
that's it the question is what should we
be asking about honeycomb on on a
smartphone 20 what are you what are your
thoughts well I'll start with a little
bit of off-topic introduction off topic
because we obviously don't cover tablets
but
geek in me wanted to had a hands-on with
all the tablets running honeycomb at MVC
so I met the zoom I am at the galaxy tab
10.1 and the optimist bed and of course
they all run honeycomb and I don't see
how anyone could use it successfully on
a smartphone I mean it's so well
designed for the tablet and everybody
was was unhappy to to find out that
google said okay 3.0 is tablet only
believe me it is just to give you short
a quick example the browser they have
implemented these tabs in the browser
with a small X button for closing a
single tab you can tap it with your hand
on a 10 inch tablet but you will not be
able to do that on a smartphone and of
course the home screen which is designed
to landscape portrait which I'm sure it
will look let's say uncool on a
smartphone running portraits in the
instead of landscape so my thoughts are
that honeycomb is for tablets and should
remain on tablets only yeah I think you
hit the nail on the head Tony I just an
hour ago got honeycomb to run on my
nexus one and it's fun and interesting
and kind of has that wow you know fun
effect that Evan alluded to but the
truth is that the buttons are so small
that I cannot use this without paying
attention to where my my finger is and
you know even if you put this on a
device like the desire HD with a 4.3
inch display it's still not going to be
a good experience right and I'm just I'm
imagining myself walking down the street
trying to use this web browser on this
tiny little screen with the small X
buttons that the point is that honeycomb
is made for for bigger screens and
unless you have a 5-inch phone like the
dell streak or even maybe the samsung
infuse with a 4.5 inch display you're
just not going to be able to use it as a
phone because it's just not made for
small screens period absolutely that
said it is cool the widgets are fun I
really haven't spent much time with it
we're going to put a video up of this
we before people get to listen to the
pocket cast so that will be that'd be
good so alright so moving on last week
there were a lot of rumors about the
next iPhone and one of the rumors which
is still a valid rumor if there was that
Apple is going to be bumping the screen
size of the iphone from 3.5 to 4 inches
now if you do the math and I'm going to
do the math again just to double check
I've got this little Excel spreadsheet
that lets me see the PPI setting or the
PPI because over what's the value 640
over 300 PPI you get to a pixel density
where the human eye cannot distinguish
between pixels that's why I Apple called
it the retina display now now that's
that's what Apple's saying there's
there's some controversial quite a bit
of controversy over that over that
either ok that's fair but I mean unless
you have like like the vision of a ego
booze genic eagle vision you're not
going to be I mean can you see pixels on
your screen Evan you have the iphone 4
no but i'm saying you know it could be
even lower than that you know that that
number was sort of something that was
just thrown out there by Apple and and
and different people different experts
will tell you different things yeah yeah
fair enough fair enough so if they bump
the screen size 24 inches their ppi
drops from 332 288 thus rendering it
according to app will not a Retina
display and so I have trouble
understanding how Apple could bump the
size of their of the iphone 4 24 inches
I don't think it's really really a
problem of seeing the pixels I mean if
you obviously can't see according to
Apple's logic 301 ppi pixels you could
obviously not see 299 so the thing is
that i think the retina display and all
the fuss around it
just a good marketing catch from apple
and if they bump the screen size and
resolution or the resolution will stay
the same and the ppi will go down they
will come up with something like I don't
know iris display or whatever I should
make the product sales spike that's
funny that's a good one it's like retina
two point oh it's called the Irish
display right yeah I think it's good to
note that itachi just started sampling
these um diese at 1280 by 720 screens
that are that are just four inches or
maybe a little bigger 4.3 so there are
definitely you know higher resolution
they're higher pixel density screens
than the retina display you know just on
the horizon and and if anyone is going
to be first in line for something like
that it's definitely the Apple okay guys
on a side note a quick question what do
you think is the maximum resolution
manufacturers would or should go up to
on smartphones they're going to go to
1080i think so so people can watch the
blu-ray content I have 1080 on my 23
inch monitor can you imagine that on a
4.3 inch display that'd be insane that
would be reducing what would be the
sweet spot I I disagree with them going
to a full 1920 x 1080 because there's
just it's just it seems that I mean
eventually okay in the future one costs
become super low but I don't think
people will have the same experience
watching a movie in high definition
unlike a display capable of near 720p
let alone 1080p I mean my dad will tell
you that he can't tell the difference
between 0 for 8 and 7 20 so there's
always going to be that that contingent
but but you know equally there there's
always going to be people that wanna
that want to max out their you know
their their resolutions and their pixel
densities and and they won't even if it
if it visually doesn't make much of it
just much of a difference you know just
because you know they have the content
at
1080 they wanted to be able to display
it like that this reminds me of when I
was younger and my brother Jared was the
editor-in-chief of pocket now he would
sometimes hand-me-down devices and he
would always hand me these devices they
like the compaq ipaq that had these qbj
displays and I I hated those screens
they were so fuzzy and blurry and for
the longest time we had qvga smartphones
and then we hit like a wall and then
everything became wvga we kind of
skipped vga like the dell axim i forget
what the model was that had vga and then
i also the HTC diamond i think that vga
yeah agency diamond but the touch pro
they so they had like a generation of
vga and then everything for the last
like two or three years has been wvga
and we're finally getting out of that
and we're going to get qhd so it's just
funny how screen resolutions kind of
kind of trend and there's a tipping
point where you see another jump to
higher so the same thing with processors
to you have a couple generations of you
know the one gigahertz Snapdragon and
then before that we had that that awful
lot that 524 28mm I was watching an
unboxing that we did a long time ago of
via touch HD and it was billed as a
potential iphone killer and it had that
processor you just talked about the 528
megahertz processor and then it had like
two hundred and eighty eight megabytes
of RAM just fun fun to look back okay so
moving on another piece of news coming
out of the Apple side of things is that
there isn't going to be an iphone nano
it's just going to get less expensive
and you know Apple does a lot of
interesting things with price they try
to make things accessible yet they put
the the ceiling pretty high for people
that want the top of the line so the
question I want to propose to you too is
what is the sweet spot of pricing for
the
phone 5 remembering that you know the
original iphone came out of the gate at
like five hundred bucks and you had to
buy it at that price it wasn't
subsidized and then I think with the the
3g the second generation iphone they
started to subsidize the price i think
it was 299 not exactly sure and then the
3gs and the four came in at 199 so
what's what's a sweet spot for the
iphone 5 I feel like inspired as really
started to push things down at just
ninety nine dollars so i think i think
we might see the iphone 5 coming in at
150 and 250 for for whatever the to
capacity configurations are 150 and 250
so still stay above that $100 magical
number yeah like you said you know Apple
still wants to to be a premium product
and they can certainly afford to be but
you know they also want to get their
their products into the hands of as many
people as possible and so you know you
have to compete on price to do that and
so it totally makes sense to have
another iphone you know and they're sort
of doing that now by by keeping the last
generation around and just making it
cheaper you know it's not entirely clear
what what they're going to be doing
differently if they're they're going to
have something that is a dedicated
product that comes out you know the
iphone 5 mini or you know iphone 5 nano
or whatever it's going to be so if they
do the iphone 5 at 150 / 250 you know
they're going to keep the iphone 4
around for like forty nine bucks and
people are going to go wild over that
yeah it's a great phone they should it
is great fun Tony what do you think
they're sweet spot is in Christ well I
agree with Evan with the with his sweet
spot on the pricing I'd say that
somewhere in time maybe Apple will be
forced to bring the price as low as 99
because let's remember one of the main
principles of the Nokia microsoft
strategic alliance is to bring lower
costs lower budget phones windows phones
too
the market and once nokia start shipping
out these cheap windows phone 7 s with
great great build quality and hopefully
Microsoft will be able to add features
to to the operating system by then I
think that competition will somehow
force Apple to to lower the price even
more I think that my personnel are going
to be a couple years out though I mean
Microsoft has is quite a bit of catching
up to do on the software side of things
absolutely do you guys think we're going
to a future where at least in the US
where phones are heavily subsidized
we'll we'll have hot new phones free on
contract well I mean we do now in some
cases through three no third party Beach
retailers like click water fly and ad
hoc and whatever yeah I think it that'll
eventually be the case through the
carriers but i think you know data plans
are also going to get more expensive too
yeah that out well i'll keep tacking on
additional fees for the 4g now wearing
the 5g network and it'll just yeah i
mean it's in the end you're probably
paying around the same your cost is just
spread out different installments yep
and installments and you know people in
America seem to really like the idea of
paying something monthly for a lower fee
than having a larger upfront cost which
is why the subsidy model is so prevalent
in the US and it's not in Europe I
that's why we spend so much on credit
cards too yeah that's right okay all
right so let's move on from the iphone
we are talking now about LTE voice
technology which they're calling vo LTE
I don't know if you're supposed to save
all T or volt voltage with us I think
it's volte faulty it's interesting that
we're finally in 2011 talking about
voice quality because I remember when I
got my first cell phone and I was 16 I
was appalled at the voice quality the
voice quality was far inferior to a
landline and you know naive me didn't
understand
why that was the case but it's possible
or very likely that in a year or two
we're going to have phones that use this
faulty service that allow us to have so
much more higher fidelity audio and you
know AT&amp;amp;T is is talking about a 2013
launch further for their phones with
faulty whereas verizon's going to do it
as early as this year and into next year
and you know a year is kind of a long
time in the smartphone industry so is it
too late for AT&amp;amp;T to launch it in 2013
should they try to accelerate their roll
out of this well I don't think it will
be too late because it's a new
technology and the sometimes being a bit
late to to the show can be to your
advantage I mean if if AT&amp;amp;T will be
bringing in balti and 2013 they will see
at least one year of feedback from the
market from the verizon point of view
and if if the product the service is not
selling that well and it's not the big
part of the market share then they might
even cancel it wait again um yeah I have
to agree with Tony here I don't think
it's necessarily going to be going to be
you know killer for them you know 18t
has it Bella put a stockpile of
customers but through their iphone
exclusivity over the last couple years
so and and as we've seen you know
they'll they'll do what it takes in
marketing to to close that gap in
technology you know bye bye following
t-mobile with their whole you know for
geez that's not really 4G but it is and
so so I think that they don't probably
you know play down the voice body on
horizon and start you know playing up
their own voice quality as well you know
even though we don't have volte yet or
whatever it's called I haven't actually
ever heard of pronounced that allowed
either even though we don't have this
yet you know nine out of ten customers
say we have the best voice quality and
they'll they'll roll out all sorts of
you know funded surveys that say that so
yeah I'm someone's got to be first and
in this industry you know sprint had a
had a year or so head start with wimax
and you know they're not they're not
eating everyone else's lunch so I don't
think it's going to be a huge it's gonna
be a big negative for 18 it's it's so
funny that you mentioned about a
Sprint's launch of 4G first and Verizon
is here now in 2011 advertising that
their network is the the most advanced
4G network I was reading a billboard as
I was driving through Philadelphia and I
saw that billboard a night I thought why
would people care if the network was
advanced doesn't that mean complexity
means difficult to understand means
unreliable I just was curious by the the
choice of words but this this volte
thing is a really big deal a few months
ago some site posted a sample of what
they called HD Voice in the UK / orange
the quality was comparable to the bump
in quality you get from a landline phone
call to skype when you skype somebody
the quality is so much better you can
hear the crispness in their voice the
boom eNOS and everything in between and
and it's going to be the same way with
with volte it's it's going to be it's
going to be a game absolutely and it's
funny you should mention that because i
was just playing with my thoughts and
with vote see there will come an
increase of coal quality I think
manufacturers will have to follow with
hardware I mean you have to have some
high quality microphones and speakers
built into volte compatible devices
because i don't think that speakers and
microphones and current devices have
evolved that much over the past
five six years I mean everybody goes
with the default I don't know what's the
frequency range of those microphones but
having high-quality voice on a new
network implies new hardware components
and that will be a bump in price tags
that's a really good point something
that I never really thought about with
with volte will see a bump in finally
speakerphone quality these tinny
stupidly distorting speakers perhaps
will become a thing of the past and
hopefully as you imply the costs won't
increase that much for handsets so
that'll be something to keep an eye on
all right let's move on here we are
talking about now ice cream sandwich
which is the next version of android for
phones will combine honeycomb and
gingerbread and you know I feel like
we've been talking about the next
version of android for phones since they
talked about honeycomb and we haven't
gotten any more clarity on what the heck
it's going to be it's going to bring
some features of honeycomb okay yeah
which it's going to be kind of like
gingerbread ok so what changes feel like
it's going to be you know mostly
gingerbread features with with a few
added things for for multi-core
processors and and probably a UI
overhaul but so that's what I'm getting
out of it maybe the they're calling the
what's the name of the interface in
honeycomb it's called mmm how is in the
holographic or how something like that
something like that well I think I think
they will bring some interesting things
from from honeycomb to to Gingerbread
and not vice versa I mean the stacks
they look great regardless if you're
talking about your stacks of photos your
stacks of YouTube videos your stacks of
digital documents also I think a good
addition to Gingerbread will be the new
mail application which has a fantastic
way of displaying your emails both in
portrait and landscape I don't think
they will bring the
the browser I mean they might bring the
browser and it's that version but they
will do some modifications to adapt it
to smaller screens but I think I think
with the speed of gingerbread and some
of the features from honeycomb maybe
even the media player they might pull
this one off good point about the the
mail application especially it's kind of
ridiculous that in stock Android when
you are in the mail application the only
way you can make a new message is by
hitting the menu button and then compose
HTC got it right in the sense version of
Android where there's a big fat compose
button at the top of your email screen
and I think what Google has been very
clear on is that the next version of
android for phones is going to bring
forth these functions more which begs
the question how are they going to fit
it on a small screen you know just just
like the browser where they can if they
want to have tabs along the top but
there's really no space for that on a on
a on a small screen unless you're using
in landscape so well on a tablet if you
are using the mail application in
landscape mode you had this split view
of your list of messages on the left and
the actual message preview on the right
if you swipe to the left you can take
the message list out of the screen and
only have the email body itself maybe
they might bring this one to gingerbread
like you have you're presented with your
message list on the while entering the
application swipe to the left you have
the preview of the of the email itself
and then swipe back to to your message
list again so there are possibilities
but I feel like that the preview
scenario only works when you can see
your message list at all times yeah
right hmm that will be interesting to
say indeed either way ice cream this
summer be there will be there we will
definitely consider yeah all right let's
move on Adele roadmap leaked that looks
very accurate or believable for
wpcentral and what we have here is or
yeah three devices now dell is
relatively new to smartphones of course
they had the streak which was the 5-inch
kind of tablet pseudo smartphone then
they had the arrow which is a low-end
mid-range smartphone that no one really
cared about and then they did the venue
pro which I know Tony's a huge fan of
and I am too and then they did the venue
without the pro which is an android
phone I had the opportunity to review
both the venue pro in the venue and I
was mega impressed I mean Dell's build
quality I think rivals or even exceeds
HTC the phones just had tremendous
quality to detail everything from the
texture on the back to the curved
curvature of the glass on the front to
the speed of the operating system to the
touch sensitivity it was just it was
right on and so we've got these three
devices we've got the wrigley which is a
windows phone 7 device with a single
core 1 gigahertz processor it basically
is a refresh of the venue pro perhaps
coming around in time for mango and the
road map has it pip pointed at July
August time frame and then there's the
Hancock we start getting into some
interesting form factors slide down
keyboard running android ice cream
dual-core processor 4 inch qhd display
this thing's going to be a tank I mean
what what slide down keyboard phone do
you know of that has a bigger screen
than four inches I mean most of them
come in at about 3.6 3.7 this thing's
gonna be huge what's the epic 4g that is
ok that is forges that's the that's the
only other one I can think of to and so
you know it's going to be a substantial
phone and then we've got perhaps a twist
on the Hancock you take the Hancock and
you add a bigger screen so 4.3 inches
stores the dual core processor still
runs ice cream so it's its base
CLE a they're kind of the same device
just one is a bigger screen so my
question to you guys is is dell on the
right track to be able to compete with
Samsung and HTC now excuse me for being
a jerk because I will be a jerk in the
upcoming minutes I'm a huge fan of the
dell venue pro and here we are four
months after windows phone 7 was
launched and there are no venue pros in
Europe I mean you've got some venue bros
in the USA but you've been following the
news and I hope our listeners have been
following the news that the dell venue
pro is delayed and delayed and delayed
again in Europe I mean how on earth
would they'll pull this off when they
are not able to launch a device a single
device in four months time frame so
excuse me well and and jerk mode so ed
jerkwad well there was a flaw I believe
there were the venue pros were crashing
or something do you remember that well
there's a couple flaws wasn't just one
they had that sound a Wi-Fi way more
yeah it was the Wi-Fi then then it was
some unnamed reason than it was some
microsoft mms settings and then again
something else that wasn't named i think
it got delayed four or five times now
and the fact is that it's four months
past the windows phone 7 launch date and
they're still no dell venue pro in
Europe I mean you can't buy it it's
ridiculous well Tony I can tell you it's
a good phone thank you very much uh-huh
I mean I mean I adam has one too mm-hmm
and we all do you getting oh yeah we
have all got three of them actually you
want life I'm just kidding uh no it's a
if you get a good one it's a really
really good phone and it's unfortunate
that they're being delayed in Europe and
it probably is going to impact the
excitement for these future devices from
Europeans because if they can't deliver
on a device that should have been out
four or five months ago you know these
next wave of devices may not be that
time and I really think the the winner
here is HTC I mean HTC 7 bro started
selling 11 and a half weeks ago and the
people who were actually waiting for
dell venue pro are starting to buy the
seven pro everybody says
waiting anymore I've been waiting for
four months so I think they should get
this thing straight first get all the
pieces together they'll make the big
picture the image and then go on and
make some new phones yeah i agree
speaking of the seven pro we will have a
full review coming up early this week so
look out for that it's not really out
yet it's coming to sprint it's available
in limited capacity in Europe but we got
one and we're going to have the four of
you coming up soon or coming up soon as
I like to tell Evan alright so it's got
a couple more things to talk about
quickly here as we approach the
60-minute market we try to keep these
pocket casts to this week we've got two
big phone releases to highly anticipated
phone releases we've got the Atrix 4G on
the date keeps changing but i think it's
the 22nd or now which is actually
tuesday and then we've got the
Thunderbolt tomorrow or actually today's
Monday well I thought it was sunday
today in a at least for the pre-order I
believe or they take are they sending
them out today I think it's only the
pre-orders yeah i think the 28th is when
they're actually shipping and going on
sale yeah so you know which one of these
phones do you think is the going to be
the biggest topic of conversation in the
geeky corners of the world or at least
the united states since that's where
they're shipping well i think definitely
atrix I mean besides the fact that that
you've got faster data on I'm
Thunderbolt you know there's there's
nothing really new there in terms of the
hardware while atrix has got a ton of
stuff that we haven't seen before so
yeah I mean it to me it's a no brainer
you know moto all the way yeah i agree
with evan a verizon was at the Mobile
World Congress and so was motorola
had hands-on with both the atrix and the
Thunderbolt and the Thunderbolt is
really just your typical HTC device with
some added on radio for higher speeds
but what will really sell the atrix is
the performance and that fantastic idea
they've got with with the dock I mean
you take the device in your pocket your
mobile you go to your office you hook it
up to your netbook like that on dock and
there you can continue working then you
go home you hook it up to your
multimedia dock and then you can enjoy
your pictures and content now regardless
of what else AT&amp;amp;T will be lets say
demanding for for extra internet I think
the Atrix 4G will generate a lot of buzz
all right I'm going to go against the
grain here I'm excited about the the
Thunderbolt because you take the inspire
4G you add a much larger battery
Thunderbolt has a nineteen hundred
million power battery that is huge you
add a front-facing camera you add 4G LTE
you know the the Atrix 4G and the
inspire 4G both have hspa+ support but
they don't have they don't have hsupa as
we found out recently there's an article
on Android Central which means that if
you're not in an area with AT&amp;amp;T hspa+
and we don't know where that it's it's
not around here because i'm not getting
hspa+ you're going to have speeds that
are slower than what you would get over
it with a standard 3g phone so either
your speeds are crappy or they're great
and it's impossible to know when they
will be great because AT&amp;amp;T isn't
mentioning anything about when this 4G
network is going to be really out there
and you can hear it in my voice I'm very
bitter about it stone because you know
you've got this you've got the 4g
capability on these phones and you just
don't get 4G speeds it's really a really
shame yeah but that's an issue the
operator has to to sell themselves it's
not the issue with the device
fair but I think what I'm trying how I'm
trying to frame this is you know if I if
I were looking for a new smartphone when
I was thinking go on verizon with a
thunderbolt going 18t with the atrix i
would probably side with the Thunderbolt
really yeah so the date is that
important to you that you would give up
the screen resolution and the dual core
and the laptop done a huge REM yeah I
don't think that stuff matters the the
dual core and the huge ram in the
laboratory here first folks no seriously
the another con of the Atrix 4G is that
it's running motoblur since the new
version of sense is far superior to the
previous versions of sense which was
slow full of eye candy and just a
headache to use you know the last sense
phone I used I was I was really trying
to find a way to turn off sense and you
couldn't but on the inspire 4G I leave
it on because it's such a powerful
device it's so well tuned that the sense
enhancements all work the way they were
intended everything is instantaneous on
this phone and the Thunder boat is
pretty much the same phone just a little
bit better
you can but you it's not so easy to root
it and then put on this it's already
routed by the way I think the Atrix 4G
got routed right right but but I mean
there's no roms for that I've seen that
have a sense so that's that's still
still not quite here yet so you guys
have fun with your HR sees gente and
Allah I'll be loading web pages faster
with the thunderbolt and we have Wi-Fi
in our houses so we'll be at all I'm
going to disconnect the router that's
not nice alright so I think that's
pretty much all we wanted to talk about
this week a lot of news out of Mobile
World Congress a lot of stuff with the
iphones and the new new dell roadmap and
we've got two big phone releases this
week that was really that was really
what we had to talk about today so
thanks everyone for listening again we
are on itunes and zune now but if you're
listening to this you must have figured
that out already so thanks again for
listening thanks Tony and Evan at once
again you Thank You Willa we'll see
everyone next time that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
