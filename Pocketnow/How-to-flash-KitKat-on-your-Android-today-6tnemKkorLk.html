available but only if you've got a nexus
5 if you want to get it on say a nexus
or you're going to have to wait or
you're going to have to know what to do
to flash it yourself I'm Joe Levi for
PocketNow these are the steps that you
need to take to flash android 4.4 kitkat
onto your nexus 4 or other Android so
before we get started this video assumes
a few things number one you're assuming
the risk any time you root or do
anything with roms you run the risk of
potentially breaking your device follow
the instructions and you shouldn't but
if you do that's the risk you're taking
next you need to be unlocked and you
need to have a custom recovery rum
available either to flash or to put on
your device we're going to assume that
you've already done both unlocked it and
have a custom recovery ROM on your
device in fact a note about custom
recovery roms for KitKat at least right
now if you're using T WRP it's not going
to work next you need two packages
first is the KitKat version for your
device I'm going to show you for the
Nexus 4 with the version that was
compiled from AOSP by the Paranoid
Android team thank you big thumbs up for
those guys next if you want to use any
of the Google apps you're going to need
the Google Apps or gaps or G apps
package right now there's only one that
I know of
also from paranoid android guys so go
ahead and gather all of those there are
links to where you can get those for a
select number of devices over at the
article on pocketnow.com so enough
talking let's go ahead and get this
thing booted into recovery mode and
start flashing some files on the nexus 4
to boot up into recovery mode the device
right now is turned off you hold down
the volume down button and you push the
power button at the same time doing so
is going to make a vibrate let go and
there you go we're now at our our
fastboot menu we want to go into
recovery mode so just up and down
and then power button to select it's
going to reboot now into recovery this
is going to take just a second at this
point what you're going to want to do is
wipe everything wipe all user data that
doesn't take as long as you might think
that it should but once it's done it's
done you will want to do this you are
going from one version of Android to
another that's going to erase all of
your data by the way if you wanted to
have a backup you should have done that
before but hopefully you're watching
this video before you're doing the steps
by yourself next we're going to install
a zip this is the touch version of the
ROM by the way this is a six point oh
point 4.3 of clock word recovery lower
versions of that do not work you will
want to make sure you have the latest
version or experience pain and suffering
like I did anyway so we want to install
zip from sdcard we're going to choose a
zip in my case I downloaded it so I'm
going to go into user 0 that is me and
you may or may not have that depending
on where you downloaded it so just go to
wherever you did it download it in this
case I am going to flash the Paranoid
Android AOSP for Meiko download or
rather flash that doesn't take very long
to do as you can see down here we're
installing the update your version is
going to be named a little bit
differently just keep that in mind but
the nice thing is the steps are exactly
the same once you've got your device
rooted and unlocked and recovery ROM
installed all you got to do is flash it
you're good to go next up is going to be
the G apps package so we're going to
choose zip from sd again going to 0 I
put it in download from here
this is the Paranoid Android G apps mini
go ahead and install that doesn't take
very long a little bit of ASCII art
there copying files and I'm going to go
one step further after this is done I'm
going to install the super su stuff so
I'll still have root after I'm all done
with this process this takes just a
minute installation is now complete
let's choose a another zip we are going
to go back here back to down
odhh and back to supersu grab that
install it very quick very easy we're
done go back and we are going to restart
once it does this this boot is going to
take a little bit of time so do not
worry about it being caught in a boot
lube or anything just yet it is going to
take sometimes two three four maybe even
five minutes so just be patient with it
this of course is the very very
old-style boot animation it's not
paranoid Android it's not CyanogenMod
it's not even the version that you get
on the Nexus 5 it's the old AOSP boot
animation if you see that don't worry
that's the right thing that you want to
see from here I'm not going to have you
sit through here for the next five
minutes while at boots I'm just going to
let you know it's going to take a little
bit of time and through the magic that
is video we're going to jump ahead in
the process once that's all done were
met with the welcome and it's selected
at United States English for me I'll
choose that to continue I don't have my
sim card in here so we're just going to
go ahead and skip over that I do however
have a Wi-Fi network in range which I'm
going to need if I don't have a sim I'll
choose that and then put my password in
off-camera Google location will set it
in there we'll go ahead and put in here
Joe Levi just like that you know next
Google services and at that point we are
now set up and we are ready to go let's
choose the launcher launcher and always
launcher always and from here this is
now the Kit Kat experience so okay okay
if you've seen any of the the Nexus 5
videos you'll know this is exactly what
you're going to get come in here and
let's throw just something on the other
page movie studio for example so you can
see now I've got another page just like
that now swiping over here to the side
I'm not pulling up my Google now so got
to figure out why it's doing that but
let's find out see what we can do okay
Google how tall is the Empire State
Building
the Empire State Building is 1,454 feet
tall that's it we now have KitKat if we
want to come in and look at settings we
can view all the way down here it is in
fact Android 4.4 it is AOSP on Mako
there you go
and there you have it if you've done
everything properly you now have a
working copy of Android 4.4 KitKat
running on your Android powered device
and you didn't even have to buy a new
phone or wait for official roms or
anything like that thanks for watching
