take a look at the 3mm pro pico
projector which is a small pocket-sized
projector we have just unboxed the AE
AXA technologies p1 pico projector
earlier and in this video we're going to
take a look at the 3m model this model
can connect two different audio vision
audio-visual sources like the p1 it is
rated for 30 or 20 thousand hour of lamp
life on its LED bulb and also is rated
for 12 ansi lumens of brightness which
is comparable to the p1 let's go ahead
and unbox the 3 mm pro 120 and see
what's included inside this box so in
this packaging after you open it the
device go ahead and remove it so this is
the 3 mm pro 120 we're going to set
aside the projector and we're gonna go
back to it in just a moment you also
have a product warranty and safety guide
essentially a user manual and unlike the
p1 from AXA technologies it looks like
the EM Pro 120 does come with a VGA
cable and can connect to a VGA port and
it also has what looks to be a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio out
cable so you can have audio onto the
half watt each stereo speakers on the
device it also comes with its own
composite cable with its own proprietary
adapter and then it looks like here we
have the power supply with different
tips for charging when you're traveling
internationally so you do have four tips
there and then this little white box
looks like we have the tripod which is
one of those flexible ones that you can
bend and adjust that way and it goes on
the tripod mount
looks like on the bottom of the device
and you just twist it on and here we
have couplers which I'm assuming goes on
to the composite cables as such and this
way you can connect the HTC tv-out cable
to the composite cable which then
connects to the device let's go ahead
and take a hardware tour of the pico
projector first at the front here you
have the bulb which is rated at 12 ansi
lumens it looks like here you have the
manual focus knob the bulb is not
covered there is nothing going on on the
side at the back of the device you have
a port for the power it looks like
here's the proprietary port for the VGA
and AV composite cable and on the top of
the device you have the 0.5 watt each
stereo speakers so the speakers are
located here and you have some control
switches at the top for power the
brightness control the volume up and
down and here's the battery indicator so
let's go ahead and we're going to set up
the device with the HTC Touch pro2 and
we're going to come back and show you
how it looks like on screen
so this is the startup screen on the 3
mm Pro we're going to go ahead and plug
it into the touch pro2 and we're gonna
get a nice video out screen and it looks
like this is plenty brighter than the p1
pico projector that we looked at earlier
from AXA Technologies we're going to go
ahead and play the same new PocketNow
video introduction and the choppiness of
the video is due to the video not being
scaled properly for the touch pro2
however here we are noticing that the
screen is a lot brighter and also the
speakers are a lot louder than the p1
from aax technologies if you want you
can actually connect an external speaker
to the m pro 120 so you can even have
louder sound so this is a quick look at
the M pro 120 from 3m thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
