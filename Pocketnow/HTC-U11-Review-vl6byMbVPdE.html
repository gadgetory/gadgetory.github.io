flagships we have companies
experimenting with taller displays and
new aspect ratios and/or one digital
assistance shorts I'm forming a
basketball team all of this is cool I
mean we need Fleck ships to continue
pushing the bar of innovation but it's
clear that some of these features are
still solutions in search of a problem
if you're looking for a more
conventional approach there's pretty
much just one new flagship in 2017 that
addresses real-world problems and stick
to the basics I'm hi Mary that was
pocket now and this is our HTC u 11
review so I've decided to ditch the
typical introduction where I tell you
just how much CTC has fumbled over the
years the company that was always late
to bring essential features to its
flagship sustain and whatever the
purpose of the u ultra was is just not
even worth comparing the U 11 is
actually a very different animal or the
result of a company that has matured in
many ways over the years for one setting
this phone on a table is an immediate
call for admiration this 3d form glass
finish that HTC is dubbing it's liquid
design is a very different approach to
curving glass instead of making it about
adding new features the whole purpose of
curving the glass is just to make this
rather large phone feel pleasant in the
hand and that definitely is a curves
extend to the glass front leading to
this pebble like shape that's easily
noticeable and the choice of a black
finish at the front helps to make this
phone more immersive for content
consumption the company decided to wait
on the whole 18 by 9 aspect ratio thing
and you know what I am NOT going to
complain as it stands pillarboxing is
what I hate the most about competing
devices and there's still a good list of
applications that is simply not ready to
support the new aspect ratio and then
there's the fact that whatever more
pixels you were gaining are compensated
by the dedicated capacitive buttons on
the U 11
this is a quad HD Super LCD 5 with
punchy color and decent blacks it does
get very bright up to the point of
offering good visibility in direct
sunlight though launching the camera
while wearing a pair of polarized lenses
is oddly hit-or-miss my only complaint
is the size of the bezels leading to a
71 percent screen to body ratio at a
time when competitors are pushing 80 our
precautions that I would recommend with
this phone is not setting it on its
front on a table as the curve seem to be
notorious for minor scratches from the
dirt and use the chamois that was in the
box as this reflective coating loves
fingerprints and then tucked inside we
have almost everything a flagship needs
meaning a snapdragon 835 4 gigs of ram
and 64 gigs of expandable storage and my
review unit includes the bonus of
dual-sim capabilities if you ditch the
microSD and we also get ip67 water in
those resistance another crucial need
for any flagship in 2017 HTC Sense makes
a return to power all the hardware on
the u11 there's a combination of HTC
design and the commitment with Google to
avoid bloat as a result there is just
one calendar one calculator Google
photos who precedes the gallery and so
on and so forth
pretty much the mentality that began
with the HTC 10 the result is a phone
that manages ran better than its
competitors all leading to zippy
performance all around graphics
intensive gains launched quickly and
work like a charm and even this
proprietary launcher and services like
blink feed work without a stutter HTC
Sense companion finally started working
for me but the whole implementation
sometimes feels hit or miss like for
example one day it did notice that I had
an early appointment and suggested that
I set an alarm in the morning something
that I honestly did appreciate the only
problem is that every other time it just
tells me that I use my phone too much I
mean like really and then there's the
company's edgesense one of those new
features that I've come to both love and
hate I mean I seriously love the
simplicity of just squeezing lightly to
get the Google feed as om c-can't in you
to ignore it or long squeeze to launch
the flashlight
I mean honestly I still consider this
hidden button to be genius the only
problem is that if it's too sensitive
you'll find the phone activating
features when you don't want it to and
then if you require more force it just
makes squeezing this phone more awkward
to your fingers I've been using the U 11
for nearly two weeks between New York
City and on Buddha's don't has proven to
be a champion retaining Wi-Fi and to
leave error signal even when compared to
other 2017 flagships only I feel that
the quality over the earpiece has gotten
slightly thinner when compared to
devices like the ten even if the
speakers have gotten a lot louder but
more on that on Kwan's Real Audio review
my biggest problem with the audio is the
death of the headphone jack
yes HTC all 2017 black ships have one
except the U 11 you know this feels like
the time when this company was insisting
that for ultrapixels were enough for a
smartphone camera I mean minimalism and
design makes sense but not in features
yes I do get the point of HTC you Sonic
and yes I do love this acoustic noise
cancellation that can pretty much only
work if the headphones draw power from
the phone and use the microphones
built-in I mean it's not as great as my
Sennheiser's but far better than pretty
much every other headphones that I've
tested that come bundled in the box the
problems really are the fact that number
one they only work with these headphones
to you pretty much have to be carrying
dongles for everything else and three
the fact that when you're in a long
flight you're going to need to charge
this phone at some point
and sadly charging your phone is
something you will be doing often I had
very high hopes for the optimizations of
Android 7.1.1 on this phone but as it
stands the 3000 milliamp hour power pack
on this u 11 is just average scratching
to the end of the day of moderate use
not heavy
now it's not average at all as this
camera the Excel Mart claims this to be
the best camera of 2017 and even if I
won't go as far as to call it my
favorite it does do a great job I love
the color saturation and detail provided
during the day and at night it pretty
much compares to every other flagship as
a solid performer even with the ultra
pixels being reduced to 1.4 microns the
bumpin aperture does compensate but
Quantrill camera review should shed some
more light on our final verdict on how
this camera competes
I love features like the three audio
recording for video making the
experience more immersive as the camera
captures audio from the directions of
its source my only complaints are the
depth of stabilization of the
front-facing shooter and how it also
stepped back in the ultra pixel Hardware
approach that we saw with the u ultra
there's absolutely everything else you
will really love what this camera can do
to conclude there is a lot to love about
the HTC u 11 this is gorgeous Hardware
matched up by up to date specifications
and with a set of unique features like
you Sonic and Ed sense that help this
phone stand apart from the standard set
of competitors out there I'd even say
that my experience using the you livin
has been delightful enough for me not to
miss devices like the Galaxy S 8 or the
LG G 6 I just wish the companies would
stop copying Apple and stupid things
like dropping the headphone jack and
calling it necessary proprietary
solutions are not what I'd call
solutions there are only exercises and
frustration that only work for companies
that have eco systems and that's not the
case with HTC now even with its minor
list of shortcomings I have no problem
in recommending the HTC u 11 this is a
great phone that's worthy of its price
tag but the question is if you'd be
willing to give this company another
chance make sure you let us know your
