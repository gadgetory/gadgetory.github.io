even sapphire issues Facebook pets a
smartphone design that's both
interesting and not at the same time and
more rumors of a motorola Nexus phablet
emerged I'm hi Mary vetta and if I sit
down at some point of this video that's
because yesterday was leg day at the gym
and if you know about that you'll
understand this is out daily
today is yet another rumor day and the
closest to official news that we have
today is of a new patented Facebook cast
for a smartphone design and Facebook
doesn't build smartphones it's try doing
that with HTC in the past then it
crashed and burned terribly even though
the smartphone wasn't actually bad
Facebook just didn't back it up for
enough time but we do have this new
patent we do have this new design it's
really odd it's hard to predict exactly
what we can expect from it but the fact
that Facebook is working with smartphone
designs to say something and for those
of you that we're really interested in
the HTC One m8 variant running Windows
Phone well we've got to rumors that are
really interesting number one apparently
it will be a verizon exclusive when it
launches which is not necessarily good
news but in the positive news that are
also on at the same time apparently this
phone is going to be called the HTC One
m8 for Windows for Windows that's going
to be the name it's not going to be
called the 8x like it was previously
called or any odd name that's different
the HTC One m8 for Windows why don't
they just make that thing dual boot that
would be perfect and speaking of Windows
Phone apparently Microsoft is gearing up
to launch two new windows phones in the
next coming days finally these new
devices will run Windows Phone 8.1 but
apparently the code names Superman
device will be Microsoft's selfie phone
you'll have a five megapixel camera at
the front that's pretty much what you're
getting and then the other code named
Tesla is apparently the successor to
Lumia 720 meaning it's not really a
flagship phone but it's not really a
mid-tier phone it will have PureView
optics etc but it won't have a great
display and stuff like that which has
been the case for windows phone it's
pretty much just keeping the existing
Lumia 925 for another year and adding
more storage to see what we get
and speaking of interesting rumors we
get more details on the motorola Nexus
phablet first of all it's going to be
codenamed Shamu so yeah they use the
name of a whale they're trying to build
a big phone and apparently rumors dew
point that we are getting a phablet
number one and that the reason why Nexus
6 does make sense as a name but even
more interesting apparently this stone
has been ready for a while and the
reason why Google did not launch it
previously was because they wanted to
sell the company to Lenovo first or to
any company for that matter but yeah
apparently we are getting all the
features of the Moto X only now this
thing is going to be built by Lenovo
Motorola which is great let's just hope
we get this phone by the end of the year
hopefully earlier and finally for the
disappointing and interesting news of
the day let's talk about the iphone 6
first of all we got two interesting
sources from China claiming that number
one apparently the 4.7 inch iphone will
not have a sapphire display because
apparently Apple is not ready they
didn't order supplies with enough time
which is odds as the mess Arizona plan
has been working for months already so
we really can't believe in that one that
much but it could be but even more
interesting rumors are that apparently
the 5.5 inch iphone and the iWatch are
giving for launch in december but since
apples never had an event in december we
assume is that Apple will announce these
devices in October probably with the
ipad event and then they're going to
launch him in december and that really
leads me to the question of the day have
you ever held back to buy anything until
december we really don't see the point
in this because in my particular case of
yeah i do but that really depends on how
your country operates here in my country
there's a bonus in december and
therefore it does make sense to hold
things until december but i don't know
how that's gonna work leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends you

news earlier before this video is phil
