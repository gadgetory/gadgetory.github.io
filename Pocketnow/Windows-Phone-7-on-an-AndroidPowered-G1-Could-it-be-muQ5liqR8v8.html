me as the android guy from pocket now
well that's really cool but as i've
mentioned before i used to be a windows
mobile guy now i'm an android guy but
you know windows phone seven it's
looking kind of neat so you think we can
put Windows Phone 7 on I don't know a g1
let's go take a look all right first and
foremost this is an actual t-mobile g1
it is running cyanogenmod but that
shouldn't be necessary to to run this
now before you get too excited no this
is not windows phone 7 running on the g
one it is however a fairly convincing
user interface that kind of looks like
Windows Phone 7 and might be enough to
fool some of your friends and after all
if you can't fool your friends what kind
of a geek are you so let's see how we do
this first and foremost you're going to
need an android-powered phone second
you're going to need something like
launcher pro which I've shown you in the
past that's an alternate launcher
program it's available free in the
marketplace but there's a trick and I'm
going to have to come back to that in
just a minute the next thing you're
going to need also from the marketplace
is something called a desktop visualizer
now that's what lets you put in these
cool shaped custom icons and that's
really all these tiles are is just a
custom widget sitting on the screen and
the last thing that you're going to need
is this icon pack now that's available
from XDA developers and i'll give you
the link in the article that accompanies
this video so you can go out and grab
that putting everything on here's a
little bit tricky so let me show you
what you need to do now first this is
just an empty screen and you'll notice
you can't scroll up and these aren't
live tiles like Windows Phone 7 but you
know we've got to give some wiggle room
there so how do we get this set up let's
go ahead and tap and hold anywhere on
the screen and we're going to add a
widget and this is where desktop
visualizer again free in the marketplace
comes into play you scroll down and i
usually do desktop visualizer large just
because i can do anything
want with that this screen likes to have
the three by one and the one by two but
if you don't know which one you're going
to plop just go ahead and choose large
and you'll be fine we'll come in here
we're going to select an icon this is
the desktop visualizer interface will
select an icon from a file and this is
going to fire up the gallery so we can
pick that icon it's a g1 so the gallery
is going to take just a little bit
longer than normal and I've got my icons
right there on my SD card I'll open that
up and let's i don't know let's do let's
do photo since we're in the gallery
right now so we tap on the photos icon
and we're going to select an action to
launch the application and in this case
it's going to be the gallery app itself
wait for the application list to load
scroll down here to gallery well select
that here's the first trick hey see this
label we don't want it so just select it
and backspace it out the reason we don't
want that is it's already included in
the graphic itself and having them both
there is just kind of redundant but what
that should do here in just a moment is
show there's our photos tile now it
looks just right on the screen but it's
not we chose that large format and that
was not entirely right you can see here
it's actually a what's that at three by
three so it's a little too big now
that's where the trick came in if you
want to be able to resize these which
you really want to be able to do you're
going to have to unlock watch your port
out or launcherpro you're going to need
to pay him I mean I know it's ironic
that you have to pay developers for
their apps but when you do that it
unlocks the capability for you not only
to add more widgets but also to resize
existing widgets which is really really
cool okay so you can see here I've been
resizing this widget a little bit i'm
going to go ahead and resize it to its
final size if I can grab this little
grippy and that's going to be this three
by one to select it you hit the back
button and there you've got your
finished tile when we tap that it opens
up into photo gallery just like you'd
expect
and it's a g1 so we have to be a little
bit patient with the loading time of the
gallery now let's put that on the page
where we want it to go we're just going
to tap and hold and if I don't
accidentally drop it we can scroll
between screens that one's all full so
we're going to drop it right there now
you can see I've got another one over
here that I need to populate but before
we do that let's take a look if you
notice I've got a 1 by 4 widget I've got
two 1 by 3 widgets a blank one space and
then another space up here and this is
the standard Google search bar and all I
did was the same thing that you saw me
do with that in fact let me show you
here I don't have enough room on this
screen so I'm gonna have to go to
another screen and drop it on but I've
got a three by one space so let's add
that widget on and i know this is
diverging a little bit from windows
phone 7 but you know we want to keep
some of our android functionality in
there too so i'm going to select google
search and that's the four by one search
widget will search all four way one it's
not going to fit so again launcherpro we
tap and hold if i do that right we tap
and hold and then we get our little
grippy and we can simply resize it to
three by one and then grab it and move
it over to where we want it to go so
we'll just drop it right up there at the
top now again we've got that other one
space so let me show you the other way
to do it then you might be able to do
this without the launcher pro paid
version so we know that's a three by one
widget so let's go ahead and try a three
by one so we'll choose a desktop
visualizer three by one widget and the
process is the same select icon from
image file and we're going to go right
back this time let's do i don't know
let's do email and it's got kind of a
picture of rustic mailboxes which is
kind of cool so there's our rustic
mailboxes we select that next we're
going to come down select the action to
watch our application it populates the
list and we're simply going to want to
come down here now
I use gmail you might use email or some
other app we're going to remove the
label say okay and then it'll take just
a moment to populate that onto the
screen now this works a lot faster on
faster phones as you might expect let's
move that over I didn't wait long enough
there we there we go and we'll just drop
that right there now I've got a fully
functional screen where I can tap to
launch tasks tab to launch mail maps
music photos I've even got my news
ticker down at the bottom got my
beautiful widgets home screen smaller or
whatever the name of that app is and
then mail calendar Tex browser photos
and phone all right there so it's not
quite windows phone 7 on an
android-powered phone but it sure does
look like it and it's a really unique
interface it's a nice way to organize
your home screens into something that's
a little unusual or uncommon and it's
definitely going to spark some interest
when you have people looking at it a
little bit more more polished and
refined in my opinion than the zune
interface that I showed you before you
can click right here to see that video
so tell me what do you think leave a
comment down below let me know II think
and of course if you like doing stuff
like this fooling your friends or
customizing your interface with unique
and novel ways I'd like to know about
that too give me a thumbs up so that I
know you want to keep watching these
kind of videos and learning this kind of
stuff on your android phone even your
now your relics your g1 here give me a
thumbs up subscribe to our video channel
and head on over to pocketnow.com to see
all the latest articles that we've got
on android and even on Windows Phone 7
so for pocket now showing off the really
cool not quite windows phone 7 interface
