issues for the iphone 7 plus google
finally confirms that we can expect an X
patch of Android wear devices soon the
amount of deals only intensifies for the
holidays I'm hi Mary vetta and thank you
for all your feedback yesterday guys
fine I will dye my hair and purple I
guess this is walking out daily the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a Samsung
Galaxy smartphone I highly suggest you
go to tmobile as the company has got
this buy one get one free deal for a
limited time where doesn't matter what
galaxy you choose you can take another
one that costs the same amount or less
so obviously if you go for the higher
galaxy you can pick whichever one you
want you can learn more on the link of
the description and speaking of buy one
get one free deals another company
that's offering these is AT&amp;amp;T through
best buy those of you in the market for
the iphone 7 or iphone 7 plus there is
another option here the cool part is you
actually also get a gift card the iphone
7 iphone 7 plus continue to be some of
our favorite phones this year so that is
another deal i would highly suggest you
consider if you're in the market for
smartwatches another brand that we
actually recommend this fossil they've
done an amazing job with their key
wonder q marshall and other q fossil
lineup of smartwatches in addition to
the hybrids those of you that want to
get yourself one right now they're
twenty-five percent off but again that
is also a little bit of time off or that
we highly recommend i want the spotlight
over to apple and send the shoes that
users have been reporting on reddit with
the iphone 7 plus particularly i'm not
exactly sure if this has to do with the
recent software update i believe tend to
just came out but users are complaining
about for example issues like purple or
green or simply no camera launched
whenever it's getting launched so
clearly this is not a hardware problem
or at least we assume it apparently is a
software issue but we will keep you
posted we're not having that problem
with our review unit by the way and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with google and android where the
company has really neglected its mobile
platform for the last couple of months
we haven't seen any products we haven't
seen any software updates they were
promising version 20 of android where it
is
out there yet the company's VP just came
on record to confirm one that we are
getting Android wear to ATO on pretty
much almost all the top of the line
android wear smart watches that are
currently in the market early next year
in addition to that we are getting too
smart watches but we're not exactly sure
these are too smart watches from google
it would be awesome to see smart watches
from google that company has done an
amazing job with hardware at least for
what we've seen with the pixel see in
the google pixel but hey it leads me to
the question of the day if you had to
pick a SmartWatch right now and i don't
really care if you don't really like
smartwatches now but hey if somebody
were to give you one today which one
would you pick in my case i will admit i
prefer notifications on android wear but
the apple watch continues to be my
favorite for a couple of particular
reasons with the exception of the polar
m600 leave us a comment down below we
