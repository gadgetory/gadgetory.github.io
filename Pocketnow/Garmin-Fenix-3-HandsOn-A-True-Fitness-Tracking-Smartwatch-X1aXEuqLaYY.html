what gps-based fitness trackers on their
top of mind the answer you'll most
likely get as Garmin but that you know
that they also make smart watches I'm
high memory that I would pocket now here
at MWC 2015 in Barcelona and let's talk
about the Garmin Fenix 3 Garmin has
spent the last two years perfecting
their SmartWatch offerings and the
latest iteration is the new Garmin Fenix
3 which was originally announced at CES
2015 a few weeks ago now off the bat
let's be clear in the fact that Garmin
is famous for making gps watches that
serve users and fitness and outdoor
scenarios and that's really what this
watch is primarily for as gps functions
provide users with accurate running
swimming cycling and hiking functions
and the device is fully compatible with
garments bevy of fitness oriented
accessories based on nt+ connectivity so
you can connect your separate pedometer
speedometer or heartrate monitor with
the Fenix 3 as well the device includes
GPS and GLONASS antennas for accurate
tracking a barometric altimeter for
accurate pressure altitude information
and you also have a barometer a 3d
compass and other features that help
users even planning running routes on
the go what makes this device a
SmartWatch is that it sports a 1.2 inch
color chroma display that's visible in
direct sunlight and also supports Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth connectivity this allows
the watch to interact with either iOS or
Android devices and provide users with
notifications from text messages email
phone calls etc it features a live track
technology that allows family members to
track you if needed and it also syncs
your Fitness data with Carmen's connect
application so you really don't need to
carry your smartphone on a run or
training there's also a connect IQ
service available which is more like an
app store for users to get custom watch
faces applications and widgets as well
though obviously all created for
garments proprietary operating system
surely this is no Android wear a
SmartWatch but one of the high points of
the watch is that all this functionality
is provided to you with one to two
months of battery life on one charge
depending on the watch settings now
probably the most striking part of the
Garmin Fenix 3 is that it's a very
elegant watch it certainly doesn't look
like a rugged running watch and it
doesn't look like a geeky Android wear
SmartWatch this devices marketed as a
non compromise solution for the most
demanding of users and well the price
tag also reflects that the basic mineral
glass and rubber watch band models
retail for $429 and the higher end
sapphire glass and stainless steel band
models retail for $600 or more this is
definitely expensive if you compare it
to some of the smart watches out there
but honestly it really doesn't have a
room for comparison and hopefully we can
prove that in a future review when it
reaches retail stores in April once
again I'm Jaime better with pocket now
