you know there are over 700,000 apps in
the Google Play Store we're all familiar
with the more popular ones but what
about those apps that you may never have
heard of that are just beautiful or
wonderful or do exactly what you want it
to do but you've never heard of them we
went searching this is what we found
so we decided to break this up into a
few different categories the first one
that we want to talk about is travel and
the first travel app is called hotel
tonight
this app comes highly recommended from
michael fisher who says he goes into the
city new york city that is and finds
just amazing deals on really high-end
hotels at the last minute there is its
catch you have to wait till the last
minute another app for travelers is
called traveler by flight stats this is
a kind of an all-in-one app that lets
you check on flights your airports
Airlines whether at your destination a
whole bunch of cool stuff and it looks
gorgeous in the process if you're going
somewhere especially by air this is the
app that you want to have on your phone
before you head out a relatively new app
from google or Niantic labs at google is
field trip this was previously called
scout but what it does is once you're at
your location this lets you use the geo
coordinates that you're sending in your
phone your GPS to be able to find all
kinds of really cool points of interest
that are around you that you may not
have known about otherwise now these
points of interest range from anything
architecture games lifestyle museums
works of art all kinds of neat stuff and
if you're into the game ingress you've
even got a little portal detector
included in here as well moving out of
travel tools let's go into general tools
and i want to start with an app called
naked browser know this isn't something
that you can search for stuff that you
probably sudden shouldn't be searching
for this is a browser that's very fast
very responsive and well doesn't have a
a lot of chrome around it what do I mean
by Chrome I'm not talking chrome the
browser I'm talking look there aren't
any buttons aren't any tabs aren't
anything they're all kind of hidden down
here behind the menu button that's how
you get to do whatever you need to do in
there
by doing that it saves your screen real
estate and it helps the browser be
significantly faster than a lot of other
browsers that you might otherwise use
let's move into entertainment and games
the first thing to show you is called
Google Currents this has been out
forever it essentially is a news
aggregator an RSS reader that makes your
stories look gorgeous it's very very
much like like a magazine great big
glossy pictures kind of offloaded for
for offline use so you don't have to be
connected except to pre-populate the
story's very nice you've got your stuff
right with you not an RSS aggregator in
the traditional sense but very very
pretty wise of glory is a world war one
fight combat simulator it's fun it's
simple it's pretty and it runs on a wide
variety of hardware this is something
that if you need to while away some time
this is the app that you're going to
want to do it with last is ingress
ingress we mentioned back when we were
talking about field trip this is a game
that's kind of like a well a geocaching
scavenger hunt team capture the flag
defend the fortress I really don't know
how to describe it but it's ridiculously
addictive what you're trying to do is
find these points of interest that
Google calls portals in game you have to
capture them upgrade them protect them
link them all kinds of cool stuff but
you've got to go back to them again and
again and again by doing that Google
through the Niantic lamps project is
collecting travel and transit
information to get to those points of
interest so that they can make their
points of interest database that much
bigger and that much more useful we've
got even more that we didn't include in
the video over at the article on
pocketnow.com if you're watching this
video on YouTube I'll have a link to
that article right down at the bottom if
you liked what you saw in this video
please give it a thumbs up if you want
to stay up to date you'll want to follow
us on Twitter our official user account
over
there's at Puckett now it's I'm at Joe
Levi if you'd like to follow me for
pocket now showing up apps that you
never knew were out there but you
probably always wanted to have thanks
