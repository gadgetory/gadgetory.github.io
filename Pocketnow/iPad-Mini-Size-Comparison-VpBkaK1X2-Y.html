pocketnow.com the iPad Mini is out and
unless you powder one in your own ends
it's really difficult to get a sense for
how thick it is and how big it is it's a
lot smaller than you think and the
pictures just don't do it justice so in
this video we're going to compare the
iPad Mini with a whole host of items to
help you get a better sense for how big
it actually is let's go okay so the
first size comparison here is my head
here's my hand and here's the screen I
can pretty much fit my entire hand on
the screen without a palm-sized screen
let's move this over to the right here
is the Nexus 7 we did a nexus 7 vs. iPad
Mini comparison recently so we'll put a
link up on the video right there and
next to that will put the Kindle Fire HD
so three seven ish inch tablets the
Nexus 7 is the most narrow of all of
them as you can see if I line it up
there you get a little extra width there
and in terms of footprint the iPad Mini
is about the same footprint has the same
footprint as the Kindle Fire HD because
the Kindle Fire HD has thicker bezels in
terms of thickness it is absolutely no
contest the iPad Mini is so incredibly
thin it will blow your mind how thin it
is and some people say it's too thin
which is kind of strange isn't it
so that is some 7-inch tablets that
spring in the iPad here next to the iPad
kind of line it up you can get a sense
for how big it is next to the iPhone 5
doing the Apple thing I guess right so
we've got a bunch of a family portrait I
guess and what else can we get out here
we can get the the Galaxy Note this is
kind of funny the Galaxy Notes screen
it's much smaller than the iPad Mini but
it's just such a big screen so here they
are compared and we'll put them up
against each other in terms of thickness
so the Galaxy Note 2 is definitely
thicker than the iPad Mini nothing that
I have in terms of gadgets here is
thinner than the iPad Mini it's the LG
Optimus G kind of a similar device to
the Nexus 4 that's on its way out
can get a sense they're the adoptive
she's so thin but again the iPad Mini is
just thinner let's see next to a compact
disc remember those yeah I don't either
well they still have those so about the
size of a compact disc in terms of width
definitely not in terms of height oh
look the compact disc is thinner than
the iPad Mini we have a winner and let's
see anything else we've got a pencil
right so apparently the iPad Mini is the
same width as a pencil and yeah I'd say
that is accurate
super thin pencil like got a good old
Ticonderoga they're still the best
pencil in the world and how about a
yo-yo I don't know why I brought the
yo-yo out there's the iPad Mini next to
a yo-yo and that should give you a
pretty good idea to the size of the iPad
Mini it's smaller than you think guys it
really is and it's much thinner than you
think as well you just got to get to an
Apple store and feel on see if it's the
right kind of tablet for you maybe you
like the thicker more sort of meaty feel
of the Nexus 7 with the rubberized
backing maybe you like the thicker bezel
if the Kindle Fire HD which gives you
sort of the Nexus 7 like screen
resolution but it adds a thicker bezel
more places to hold it and so forth so
hopefully this video was helpful and
helping you size up the iPad Mini that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
