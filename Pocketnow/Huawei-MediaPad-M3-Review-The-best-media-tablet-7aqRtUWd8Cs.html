anything but exciting it is always a
breath of fresh air when a company gets
one right IMed even I would pocket now
and this is our review of the huawei
media pad m3 last time I went crazy over
an Android tablet was the second
generation Nexus 7 and that was years
ago
still of the rumors of its successor
continued to point to a Huawei 7p the
simple idea of this media pad m3 being
the inspiration is actually a great idea
Media pad was the perfect choice for its
name I spent the last few weeks using it
to consume content and the experience
has been delightful
it starts with its 8.4 inch 2k display
that Dwarfs the iPad Mini and pixel
density saturation and viewing angles it
then continues with the dual 1 watt
hi-fi speakers and the AKM hi-fi chip
that's powering them under Harman Kardon
branding sure this is not the first
tablet being backed by a famous audio
brand but these speakers are not playing
around so far this is the loudest and
deepest audio experience that I've ever
had with an Android tablet even with the
speaker's not being front firing hours
powering media consumption is the 60
nano meter octa-core Kirin 950 chip
match with 4 gigs of ram and a 5100
milliamp hour battery that's rated for
11 hours of video playback the result a
very powerful tablet that's perfectly
sized for graphics intensive games and
watching a movie on the fly the feel in
the hand also plays a major role
Huawei's choice of mimicking the Nexus
6p s design with the aluminum finish
doesn't only seem futuristic but feels
great in the hand then there are the
cool features like the eye protection
mode that warms the display for all of
us night owls and also the fingerprint
scanner that includes gestures from the
glory webos days for quick navigation
there are either 32 or 64 gigs of
expandable storage for your choice of
media and our review unit not only
includes LT capability but it also mimic
- smartphone thanks to a dialer
application included and you'll notice
that apps like whatsapp will work on it
which were really only blocked for
smartphones about the only thing to
complain about here is emui
where it continues to be Huawei's choice
of approach for Android 6.0 marshmallow
the experience is an acquired taste that
I mainly enjoy for its notification
shade but which quickly made me switch
to the Google now launcher after the
second day and then there are the
cameras then won't go beyond being
useful for a document scanning or video
but then again that's not necessarily
bad as you shouldn't be that guy that
takes photos with a tablet right about
everything else this is a great Android
tablet Huawei has outdone itself with an
amazing build quality great performance
one of the best displays I've seen on a
tablet and so far the best speakers on
an Android device period the price tag
is probably a little too steep starting
at 399 in certain markets where iPad
minis can be found for Less still if
you're invested in the Android ecosystem
this is an experience that I highly
recommend and when I wish would extend
to the Nexus tablet future or Google
pixel future whatever it's going to be
