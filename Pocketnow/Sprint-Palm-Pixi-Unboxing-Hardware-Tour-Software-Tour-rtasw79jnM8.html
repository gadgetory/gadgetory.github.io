calm and today we're going to do an
unboxing Hardware tour and a software
preview of the webOS and synergy engine
on the sprint palm pixi the palm pixi is
available right now on the sprint now
network for ninety-nine dollars let's go
ahead and start with the unboxing and
see what's inside so here's the
relatively attractive packaging for the
palm pixi go ahead and open up the box
which is housed inside a hard plastic
enclosure and here is the palm pixi
we're going to go ahead and set this
aside it sits on top of this molded
plastic tray on the bottom you have
manuals which are available in both
English and Spanish so they're bilingual
and it looks like sprint also included a
recycling pouch to recycle your old
phone once you've upgraded to this nice
smart phone also inside the box you have
a wall charger with nice pop out prompts
for charging and it attaches via a USB
cable you also have the USB cable and it
attaches to the device via a microUSB
connector and it can charge or stand
think either through the wall charger or
through the computer so you can connect
it to your computer as well I'm going to
go ahead and power on the device and
then we're going to do a hardware tour
so the device has a 2.63 inch 320 x 400
it's a capacitive touchscreen that
supports multi-touch and unlike the palm
pre which has a slightly taller screen
this one is shorter by 80 megapixels in
the vertical Department on the screen on
the palm pixi supports 18 bits of color
which shows nice color rendering on a
very crisp screen on the front you have
the earpiece speaker at the top and on
the bottom here you have the keyboard
with raised keys and it offers a very
nice clicky feeling and in my experience
with the device I offers very accurate
on typing so unlike the palm pre which
has a slightly wider keyboard but the
keys aren't as pronounced
and raised and the keys feel a little
bit mushy er the Pixies keyboard feels a
lot better for a less expensive
smartphone than the pre is set out to be
the pre retails for 149 whereas the pixi
is ninety-nine dollars the side of the
device the left side on is very clean
there's nothing going on here and it
shows off a very nice and slim profile
and you'll definitely feel that in your
hands once you're holding it at the top
left corner you have the power button
moving over to the side you have a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack on the right hand side of the
device you have the volume up in the
volume up and down and a ringer toggle
switch right on tops to quickly silenced
the phone and put it in to vibrate at
the bottom on the right here you have
the a flap that opens up to review a
micro USB charging port the flap
attaches to the phone itself and keeps
itself secure via a magnet which is a
nice touch on the back of the device you
have a 2 megapixel camera with LED flash
and what looks to be a stereo speaker
actually is only a mono speaker once you
open the back battery cover which wraps
all the way around to the front of the
device and offers a very sturdy feeling
the battery cover that ships with the
phone is a matte black finish you can
also get an artist series cover with art
on it or this business class classy
perforated battery cover and this one is
specifically compatible with the
touchstone are charging dock so with the
touchstone doc go ahead and reattach
this one if you place the device on the
dock itself it attaches via a magnet and
the dock is intelligent enough to know
that once you answer your phone when it
is thought calls will be routed
automatically through the on speaker
phone rather than through the earpiece
which is a nice touch and the phone it
looks like is now in airplane mode so
we're going to go ahead and turn off
airplane mode on the bottom here you
have a touch sensitive area and the
center home or launch button on
the palm pre which used to be a hardware
button is now built into this this touch
sensitive area when the first explore
synergy by launching the contacts card
and I'm going to go ahead and search for
my contact information on here the nice
part about synergy is that it integrates
your different accounts that you have
that you use to contact a person with so
here there's a google account a linkedin
profile and AOL instant messaging and
also a facebook profile you can also
link in an exchange account and also a
yahoo account if you use those to manage
your contacts the nice part about it
also is that with addresses this one's
actually mapped through the palm
headquarters in sunnyvale california if
you tap on an address it will open up
the address in google maps and google
maps will also use the built-in GPS on
the device which is a very nice touch
and adds to the simplicity of it if you
tap on a phone it will automatically
pull it up if you're in the home screen
right here and you type in a word you
can go ahead and search for it and it
will actually pull up the the contact
information or if it's not on on your
contacts it will pull it up in google
and search it that way so there is
universal search on the device the other
important thing that i wanted to show
you is the messaging app which pulls
nicely with this energy engine as well
here you can see a threaded conversation
that I started with myself I'm using a
different account on a computer if I
were online on the computer right now
would show a green dot next to my name
but since I'm offline on the
conversation as you can see started in
AOL instant messaging but since I'm
offline it moves to text messaging so
it's a nice touch to have all your short
messaging like IM and SMS integrated
into a threaded conversation view with
the center button in the touch sensitive
area if you tap on it it launches you
into car view where you can pan around
and see which card you want to go to and
and if you tap on it it will open the
card however if you drag the card up and
off the screen it will close the card so
you can manage your multitasking that
way as well which is a very nice touch
the device also has a proximity sensor
and a light sensor as well as Bluetooth
and GPS but it does not have Wi-Fi
built-in we're going to go ahead and
launch the mail application and palm if
you have multiple email addresses set up
palm also gives you a unified inbox and
pinch and zoom and multi-touch are
supported in the email application as
well the really nice part about the
email is not what it supports but how
you can set up email accounts in your
looks like I tapped on something on your
email accounts if you have if you just
know your email account and the password
that's all you need to set up an email
account with the synergy engine you
don't need to know any of the settings
which is a nice touch above and beyond
what is offered in Windows Mobile and
even Android where you actually need to
know some of the elementary settings
there's also a notification area here we
got a new address we can tap on it too
or a new email if you can tap on it to
see what it is and it shows you a quick
preview if you tap on it it will launch
the email application so notifications
are discreetly handled through the
bottom notification area and also the
device has support for 3d graphics so
opengl 2.0 is supported it has a 600
megahertz processor which is similar to
the clock speed on the palm pre but the
pre feels a little bit more responsive
for some reason than the Qualcomm chip
that's used here again this is an
entry-level smartphone so you can expect
the high-end performance but overall if
you don't open too many cards it is a
very responsive device we're going to
open up the web browser here which
supports visual
bookmarks you can type in a URL or if
you type in a search term that's tie
pins cookie since cookie isn't stored on
the phone it offers you suggestions if
you want to search for it in Google or
Wikipedia we go ahead and cancel out of
that and just open the pocket now home
page and use the accelerometer to switch
it into landscape mode and here's the
progress and although the page hasn't
finished loading the basic contents um
are there so you can go ahead and just
look at the content that you want double
tap to zoom in pinch and zoom to zoom in
further or zoom out as you need to so
this has been a quick look at the palm
pixi which runs on palms web OS
operating system and uses the synergy
engine for contact on integration and
management on the sprint now network the
device again is available for ninety
nine dollars on a two-year contract and
it uses the CDMA radio and network and
also has the evdo rev a support for fast
mobile broadband data on the device
doesn't have Wi-Fi like the older
brother the pixi but with evdo rev a I
didn't find that the device on struggled
at all with download speeds I'm Chung
win for pacquiao calm and thanks for
