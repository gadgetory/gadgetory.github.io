believe it or not it's actually better
than we expected Apple may be merging
iOS and Mac OS after all but not
necessarily this year and we already
have certification documents for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 I'm Jaime Rivera
and early certifications in addition to
an early video I'm spaced out because
it's been a crazy day but let's get to
the news this is PocketNow daily
official news today begin with
well Facebook's recent event that looked
pretty much like if it was a full-blown
product announcement and it was to a
certain degree mainly because of the
company's pretty much launch of the
oculus go and mainly not necessarily
just the hardware for 199 that's not the
biggest news it's really the platform
they want to make this something really
big where you can even if you saw the
event you can even walk into like your
old home with your family and look at
photos that you took at specific areas
there are a ton of things that are
coming with this platform I'm not
necessarily gonna call this cool or not
but it is definitely unique
now let's talk about the LG V 30s thank
you I don't even know why we're talking
about this phone right now with the g7
but the g7 has left for the end to worry
v 30s thank you is now available on B
and H for nine hundred and thirty bucks
and obviously it's a V it's got a couple
of extra things you can learn more about
but nine hundred and thirty bucks and
now ya know now I don't know why we're
covering this so early but according to
sources there is already a certification
for the Samsung Galaxy Note nine in
China pretty much everything that we
have in the specifications of the Galaxy
S nine is what we're getting on this
note nine and certification documents
are official now there are no photos of
the phone there is nothing that we can
provide in addition to just the fact
that it got announced but yeah
certification is in let's see how early
we get the phone hopefully we get it
earlier than always now for those of you
that we're thinking that Apple might
never merge iOS with Mac OS apparently
the project is being jump-started again
it was a project marzipan and we don't
exactly know what that means but
apparently the company is still going to
get this done when is it going to happen
it's not going to happen this year
apparently it will happen next year
we're not exactly sure if it's going to
be the future of iPads given all the
decline of tablets but I think that it's
the smartest thing that Apple can do
given exactly that but hey tablets have
declined globally so anyways and finally
the hottest news today have to do with
the LG
vii in queue that was announced today I
actually had to pre-record this video to
be able to go to the event our hands on
had already happened we had some time
with the phone
my initial impression says you will see
in the hands-on are that actually this
phone is not bad some people are calling
it a me to phone I am NOT because LG
focuses a lot more on content
consumption that other companies and I
feel that LG does it better I also
prefer the wide-angle camera on the LG
t7 over pretty much almost every other
approach out there I'm not saying the
camera is better I'm just saying that
it's more useful in many scenarios but
obviously you've seen the hands-on let
us know in the comments what do you
think about the LG G 7 thank you again I
like it but let us know in the comments
what you think friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow was on
