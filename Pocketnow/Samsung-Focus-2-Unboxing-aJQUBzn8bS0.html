pocket now the samsung focus is one of
the first Windows Phone 7 devices and it
represented the platform very well it
was thin it was light it had a speedy
CPU it had a beautiful super amoled
display it was based off of the galaxy s
at the time and overall it really
provided a fantastically fluid and
smooth experience that help people fall
in love with Windows Phone and so it's
no wonder that Samsung is doing a
successor to the focus the focus too but
this time the focus has LTE a faster cpu
and a new design in this video we're
going to unbox the samsung focus to on
windows phone 7.5 so let's get to it all
right and here's the box and it comes in
white and we're going to take a look at
the specs as mentioned it as LTE the
original Samsung Focus did not have LTE
right now you'll be hard-pressed to find
an area with AT&amp;amp;T LTE they're building
out the network but fortunately they
have that really fast hspa+ fallback
speed so you're always getting pretty
fast download and upload speeds with
this phone the processor is a single
core snapdragon 1.4 gigahertz so
technically 400 megahertz faster than
what you get on the original focus this
is actually the same ship used in the
Lumia 900 so performance should be quite
good at 512 megabytes of RAM eight gigs
of storage space for inch Super AMOLED
screen as wvga resolution so the pixel
density will be better than the Lumia
900 because it's a smaller screen but
it's still not going to be sharp and as
Chris pets as some of those higher
android phones out there like the One X
so let's open up the box and see what we
have and of course texting and driving
can wait we know that don't text and
drive and see if we have any interesting
accessories white headphones to match
the white color of the phone and nice
little tiny samsung charger let's move
them out of the way and take a look at
the new focus too feels very plastic in
hand just like the original but that's
okay plastic texture kind of usually
means that
going to be a lightweight phone in fact
this actually feels a little heavier
than the original focus curious to how
it looks next to the original focus it
looks sharper and cleaner definitely
definitely more grown up there about the
same size they have the same size screen
a some might argue that the black looks
a little bit more slick but white is is
the the color of the day here in the in
the smartphone industry we've got that
silver strip going all the way around
kind of a design cue from the original
but interestingly it appears on the back
which is a nice touch it really is I
both have five megapixel cameras and of
course Windows Phone as that dedicated
camera key which makes it quick and easy
to take pictures ok let's start off
we'll do a quick web browsing tour to
see if there's much of a difference
between going from 1 gigahertz to 1.4
gigahertz on a similar kind of
configuration all right here we go we've
got both devices turned on the focus to
and the focus on the right both are
clean of any user data they're both on
the same Wi-Fi network and they're
actually running different software
versions we've got windows phone mango
on the focus to Windows Phone 7.5 and
we're running with Windows Phone 7 not
7.5 on the focus the reason we're doing
that in this test because we want to see
how far the hardware and the software
has come since about two years ago when
the original focus was released will do
future videos where we compared the
focus to with another mango device like
the Lumia 900 so keep an eye out for
that so let's kind of move around in the
operating system and take a look at the
hardware the screens look pretty much
identical that's because they are
identical both sumer Super AMOLED panels
wvga resolution and things just pretty
much look the same I can't tell a
difference between the contrast they're
both saw set on default brightness right
now let's go over to Internet Explorer
and launch that okay so definitely the
focus to was faster and getting to the
web so we're going to go to
pocketnow.com okay the address is in
let's press the button will probably be
asked to choose between the mobile site
or the desktop site we're just going to
go full throttle here on the desktop
site to see which of these guys goes
faster ready set go
it looks like the focus to is getting
their first
and the focus is a little far behind
we're going to let it load in the word
move around the page and see if there's
a perceptible difference in the
performance because we've got the faster
processor on the focus too so while the
focus is is rounding what's going to
pinch around windows phone always is
very buttery smooth in the browser
especially with the latest and greatest
single core Snapdragon very smooth flip
down the page it's quite good we got a
little blank out there for a sec zooming
and panning is good let's go to another
page a little delay there a lot smoother
here on the focus to naturally and
that's the way it should be two years
later and let's see if we can get this
to kick out the next page and they're
off it's actually pretty amazing how
much of a delay there is between these
two devices definitely much better
performance on the focus to which we
want to see with a faster processor and
the latest software so we've got a lot
more coming up on the Samsung Focus to
its an LTE phone and it's pretty cheap
too it only fifty dollars pretty amazing
how inexpensive the latest and greatest
smart phones have become first
impressions it feels very slippery very
slippery in hand it also feels very kind
of shared looks very shiny which is nice
and it's white so it's not going to pick
up fingerprints too much but definitely
a plasticky phone which also means it's
a light phone it's a quite thin but
definitely doesn't feel as thin as the
original focus so if you're upgrading
don't expect this to be a thinner phone
if anything it's a little bit thicker
it's got that lovely LTE radio in there
if you're lucky enough to have LTE in
your area otherwise you've got the hspa+
fall back so if you liked this video
give us a thumbs up and if you want to
know something specific about the
samsung focus to drop a comment and
we'll do our best to answer your
question that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
