morning's blackberry ten announcement
but if blackberry wants to take on the
big players iOS and Android it has a
third place contender to deal with first
in the form of Microsoft's Windows Phone
so let's see how it does that I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is blackberry 10 versus Windows
Phone 8 ok so just like our blackberry
versus Android comparison from just a
couple hours ago the BlackBerry versus
Windows Phone comparison starts at the
lockscreen and the differences also
start there but there are a lot more
similarities in this example they both
slide effectively from the bottom you
really can't slide Windows Phone from
the top to well and there are lots of
cool similarities here we've got big
time we've got in Windows Phone we've
got big date and somewhat big daytime
blackberry also got a preview of your
events and a preview of your
notifications in the peek over here and
in the little notifications down here a
big difference here is that Windows
Phone just like any other operating
system besides blackberry almost makes
you unlock by pressing a physical button
you can't press the home button you
can't do anything and do anything fancy
you just have to press that button and
then unlock the screen with blackberry
if you watched our Android video or our
first hands-on you'll be familiar with
this you can just drag a finger up from
the bezel and you have unlocked your
device which we think is pretty awesome
next huge difference is going to be in
notifications now this is a big sore
spot on Windows Phone because there is
no real Notification Center as we at
pocket now and many other people have
commented on in days weeks months and
years past
Microsoft is rumored to be working on
one but it's just not there it's
probably gonna live to the left of the
home screen here you'll notice wiping
and nothing is happening
it's just begging for a Notification
Center there but it is not there so for
right now you have live tiles here with
notification counts on each specific
live tile you can arrange these tiles as
you like but it's not a unified
Notification Center it means always
having to return to the home screen to
check your note
vacations the situation on blackberry
really couldn't be any more different in
addition to the peak functionality which
lets you see your message counts from
any app even if you're on the home
screen i'm screen is one thing but if
you're inside say the settings
application you can just slide up and
peek see if any of those are worth it -
you know I don't really want to check
any of those I'll go back to the app but
if something does piqued your interest
you can have peak I didn't mean to do
that you can continue the movement just
by dragging over to the right here and
you have the BlackBerry hub now this is
currently set to Twitter but I'm going
to go ahead and hop into the hub itself
and now this is a unified list of
everything that I've built into the hub
which includes email accounts Twitter
account Facebook account etc etc and
this is accessible from any point in the
OS and then if you want you can filter
those by say you know you can take them
out of there out of it of its unified
state but I like to keep it all together
and BlackBerry has been very good at the
unified inbox for a while also we would
be negligent if we didn't point out
BlackBerry's iconic flashing red
notification indicator which lets you
know when you have messages waiting when
you've missed system events missed calls
or something like that
Windows Phone this particular Windows
Phone the achieve Odyssey does not
support a notification LED but more than
that even windows phones with LEDs do
not typically use them for notifications
they're only for charging indicators so
all that's taken together we usually
don't choose winners or losers in these
early comparisons but we have to say
blackberry really has notifications in
the bag in this particular comparison so
what about local search well on Windows
Phone 8 there is no local search you
noticed there is dedicated search button
which takes you to bing which is a
really nice shortcut there and you can
search the internet for say something
like pocket now for all your smartphone
and tablet news needs but it only
searches the web and if we look we can
do we can get local results and that's
nice we get media and photos of our logo
and stuff and you buy shopping I guess I
guess we have something to do with
women's lacrosse I don't know but there
is no local results at all you cannot
search the device if you want to search
the device for a con
to go into the people hub if you want to
search for something in Foursquare you
have to jump into Foursquare jump into
Facebook you have to go and you have
this very siloed experience on Windows
Phone if you're searching for something
you have to make sure you're in the
right place before you start your search
that is not at all the case on
BlackBerry 10 if you'll notice if you
unlock the device you have a search
option here front and center very
similar to the Bing shortcut there and
that persists whether you're in the app
drawer or in the homescreen it does go
away if you hop into an app but that is
always accessible via the hub
functionality and actually we started a
search there but there it is down down
below you can do a search and we'll go
ahead and do pocket now once again let's
see what kind of results we get now if
we spell it right we get much better
results now boom and there we have all
of our mail all of our contacts with
pocket now in the name any mention of
pocket now on the device there's just a
bevy of results there which is very very
handy and then of course you can filter
your search as you see fit we're having
all kinds of complicated conversations
about device features here let's just do
something simple and launch an app so on
Windows Phone you'll notice the home
screen ribbon here you these live tiles
are not just indicators for
notifications but they're also shortcuts
to apps let's just hop into Foursquare
because that's what we did last time
there's a splash screen and the app goes
ahead and starts now we since we have no
system search we can't search for an app
and just jump right into it but that's a
very simple way of doing it come back to
the home screen and there and that is to
do the same thing on blackberry 10 of
course we have a couple different
choices we can just hop into the app
drawer and tap on the app and launch it
and that's just fine but you'll notice
it is also right there because it's one
of our recently used apps on the home
screen here so if it's an app you use
all the time like say Foursquare you
jump it around and check it in places
and it's always there because you're
want people to know where you are you
just go ahead and tap it right from
there and you can launch it from there
or if for some reason that's not there
you can't find it you don't want to you
really like typing things you just go
ahead and type Foursquare and there it
finds it in the application it finds a
contact about Foursquare it finds
messages relating to Foursquare and you
expand that search if you want to but
really I just want to open the app boom
just like that now we covered a little
bit about multitasking on the Windows
Phone side of things this is your ribbon
of recently run apps and if you want to
cancel them you can go ahead and press
the X and that will disappear and
rearrange that and we jumped back into
there and we can go ahead and cancel a
phone app and then if you want to hop
into one you just tap on it and that's
nice
Windows Phone offers a similar
arrangement requires you to press and
hold on the back button and then you get
this card like ribbon of recently used
apps however it doesn't give you the
functionality to close them and if you
want to close apps instead of just
tombstoning them in memory you actually
have to kind of spam the back key until
you you can do this one at a time or you
can just spam it until you can't go any
further you're back home key and that
means nothing the home screen I mean
nothing is running in the background
with blackberry you can just manage it
right here because the task switcher is
a core component of the OS which is
pretty cool and it's something we really
haven't seen since the webOS days so
these are philosophically different
platforms Windows Phone 8 emphasizes
simplicity and minimalistic design
whereas blackberry 10 places a much
higher priority on functionality at the
expense of intuitive Ness
so there is a higher learning curve on
the BlackBerry device which one will
ultimately come out on top as anyone's
guess and we're gonna be doing a whole
lot more in the way of comparisons and
editorial content on these two platforms
and all the others going forward but in
the meantime on this first day of actual
public exposure to blackberry 10 it is
very nice to see two contenders for the
number three spot in smartphones that
are so very different in very good ways
lots more to come on blackberry 10 folks
