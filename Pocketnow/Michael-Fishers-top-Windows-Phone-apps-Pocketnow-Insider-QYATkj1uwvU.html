personal use or for review there's a
handful of apps I always download right
away because I can't live without them
so here they are I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow insider and these are my
top 5 apps for Windows Phone now
obviously we're skipping the usual
suspects here everyone already knows how
much I use Instagram Facebook and
Twitter and if you don't already know
what a tweeting fool I am
you should follow me at captain two
phones and follow PocketNow too while
you're at it so you don't miss future
features so besides those big names one
of the very first apps I download when I
move into a new Windows Phone is
connectivity shortcuts on iPhones and
Android devices you've got constant
access to quick toggles for features you
turn on and off a lot like Bluetooth
Wi-Fi the airplane mode and so on now
Windows Phone doesn't have that
convenience out of the box so
connectivity shortcuts provides it you
can either use the app itself as a hub
for your toggles or you can pin the
toggles you use most often directly to
your Start screen for easy access the
icons aren't the prettiest but you can
change the colors of the various toggles
to suit your tastes and it performs
flawlessly on every Windows Phone we can
find all for free that's an awesome
price to pay for such a no-brainer
convenience that frankly should be
included in the OS so once you've used
connectivity shortcuts to switch off
your Wi-Fi and toggle GPS on you can
strike out into the wilderness with your
Windows Phone but you'd better have an
app that lets you make the most of your
phone out in the wild and that's where
Jack of tools Pro comes in now I've been
using this one since cross-country
roadtrip about two years ago when Jack
of tools helped me determine why I was
having such a difficult time breathing
and it turns out it's because I was
about 8,000 feet above the ground when
driving through the mountains sure you
can find tons of altimeter 's and
compasses and levels and flashlight apps
in the Windows Store separately but Jack
of tools bundles all these together
under one roof
it also includes more specialized tools
like a caliper and a sound meter and you
can pin all of these directly to the
Start screen as well it's neither the
prettiest nor the most stable app but
its convenience outweighs its occasional
instability if you're a Windows Phone
toting outdoorsman the two bucks you'll
spend on this app will probably be well
worth it and if you take a lot of
pictures whether indoors or out you're
gonna want to invest in fotor with over
500 five-star ratings and a free price
tag this is a real no-brainer for anyone
who likes manipulating pictures yes
there's all the usual newsworthy stuff
like cropping rotating and yeah yeah but
where the real fun starts is in the
effects folder where so many layers and
filters await that I can't even count
them you can lay anything from an
explosive lens flare to a mould effect
over your photograph drop a whole slew
of frames atop it and then you can add
tilt-shift effects on top of that there
are so many options it can seem a bit
overwhelming at times but the interface
is straightforward enough and the end
results are cool enough that a little
option overload is a really small price
to pay for so much versatility I'm very
glad this app is free but I have no idea
why it is for the feature set you get
the developer could easily charge 2 to 3
bucks a pop and speaking of highly rated
apps well you knew this one was coming
Microsoft's fight with Google has left
Windows Phone without a feature filled
YouTube application but Metro tube has
been there as our faithful gap-filler
for long enough to rack up over 10,000
reviews and a nearly perfect rating
Metro tube doesn't just let you watch
YouTube videos it lets you filter
searches by time relevance or category
you can pin videos directly to the Start
screen and you can preload videos for
later viewing which is really handy if
you ride a train and don't have coverage
the whole way add in a reliable comment
system and integration with your
personal Google account and you've got
real-world proof that sometimes
third-party apps are just as good as
if not better than the originals and
finally if you're the gaming sort you've
got a tribe rise of glory
this flight combat sim might not be as
well developed as its counterparts on
other platforms and it certainly doesn't
have the sophisticated multiplayer
options of its Android sibling air
supremacy instead it's a simple flight
simulator with rich environments smooth
gameplay great sound effects and a fun
storyline and it runs well on pretty
much every Windows Phone we can find
sure we like Sparkle - and asphalt 8
also but you can find those on other
platforms as this particular version of
rise of glory can only be found on
Windows Phone then since I've been
playing it for years it takes spot 505
in today's app roundup but that's just
me folks you Windows Phone users out
there have your own selections for top 5
Windows Phone apps
top three top one whatever it is drop
them down in the comments below so we
can all learn something from each other
and if I OS or Android or more your bag
and you want to know about the top apps
on those platforms our own Taylor Martin
made his own video about that very thing
check it out here at pocket now and stay
tuned for much more in the weeks ahead
in the meantime thank you very much for
watching once again this has been
michael fisher with pocket now and we'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
