pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna unbox the AT&amp;amp;T captivate this is a
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone now Samsung
is achieving something that only HTC has
been able to do which is release a
common device across all carriers in the
US
and also overseas HTC did this with the
touch pro2 which was a very popular
device now there are a few reasons why
we are very excited about the captivate
or or more generally the Galaxy S series
of smartphones and we've covered the
Galaxy S on pocketnow.com but this is a
specific version for AT&amp;amp;T number one the
hummingbird platform which has been
known to be significantly faster than
the Snapdragon platform that we find on
the Google Nexus One and the HTC EVO 4G
people say that the Galaxy S smartphones
are best we're looking forward to that
number two the Super AMOLED screen
brings really good outdoor screen
visibility to the richness of the AMOLED
display AMOLED displays are awesome for
showing colors and contrast and saving
on power they're kind of bad on outdoor
screen visibility the Galaxy S
smartphones claim to help with this
problem and number three we get a whole
new suite of software Samsung's vision
of how Android 2.1 should look on the
mobile device really excited let's get
to the unboxing of the AT&amp;amp;T captivate
let's do it
okay let's do this and by the way don't
forget that this device in different
forums is coming to t-mobile is the
vibrant to Verizon as the fascinate and
on to sprint as the epic 4G which I
think is probably going to be the best
because it also has a slide-out keyboard
so let's just dump this out here there
is Samsung Captivate a Galaxy S
smartphone they're really pushing this
galaxy s branding so that when you go to
buy your phone on any carrier you say oh
I want a galaxy s phone let's see what
we have around the box so we get the
battery stereo headset that's good that
they're including a headset but no case
and let's look at the back here so we've
got the Super AMOLED display Android 2.1
though it's upgradable to 2.2 probably
later this year 1 gigahertz processor
although it runs at the same clock speed
as the snapdragon again technologically
it's faster can compute a lot a lot more
calculations in a second then can the
snapdragon a gps 5 megapixel camera you
can record 720p video DLNA support so
you can play back your multimedia on
variety of devices one of the first
phones to have the 3.0 Bluetooth
standard built in a six axis
accelerometer TV app capable and so
forth let's let's break the seal here
okay socio broken and let's get this
open here all right I've got a little
information packet cool don't text and
drive one of the great things about the
Galaxy S smartphones this is the screen
size four inches which is not too much
bigger than the Nexus One but it makes a
big difference when you're trying to
type on the on-screen keyboard let's dig
into the box see if there's anything fun
the headphones charger I'm gonna go
ahead and say nothing is really fun in
here some software well anyway let's
take a look at the captivate okay so
here it is a very thin sleek device
definitely larger than a lot of other
devices out there I'm going to try to
peel off this screen protector here
there should be a little tab pretty cool
design here on the back sort of a
checkerboard design Wow looks like
carbon fiber actually it's obviously not
carbon fiber but it looks like that very
thin it feels like a sliver it's
actually kind of curved around the edges
has a nice feel to it let's get this
protector off okay and there we got it
so just a flush front we've got some
capacitive Android buttons here a very
nice looking device very large screen
can't wait to turn this on for the first
time let's look at it next to some other
devices like the Google Nexus One of
course this is the AT&amp;amp;T Edition and you
can't really tell but the screen is
pretty much bigger than the Google Nexus
One they seem to be about the same
thickness
very nice let's take a look at it next
to the iPhone 4 a significant difference
in screen size the iPhone 4 has just a
3.5 inch display the captivate is at 4
inches the resolution on the captivate
is 800 down and 480 across like the
Nexus 1 and like the HTC hd2 speaking of
which here is the HD 2 with the massive
4.3 inch display and also next to the
Verizon Droid Incredible which also has
a 4.3 inch display and the captivate
feels thinner than the Droid Incredible
but it's not
and let's turn it on for the very first
time I'm curious to see what the screen
looks like I haven't seen a Super AMOLED
screen in person that many times and let
me zoom in a little bit and see the
startup sequence here
well it's booting up let's take a little
tour around the device volume up and
down rocker it said it had TV outs
through what I'm not sure perhaps I'm
missing one of the ports we've got the
USB up here from micro USB alright here
it comes and the screen looks awesome
from right here and nothing's really
happened yet so we've got to pop in an
SD card start using this we'll be back
very soon with more videos on the
Samsung Captivate on AT&amp;amp;T please thumbs
up the video and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
