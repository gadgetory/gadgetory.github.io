pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to unbox the Amazon Kindle 3 this
is the newest version with the 3G
wireless connectivity let's get to it so
this is going to be a Youtube only video
because obviously the Kindle 3 is not a
smartphone but it has smartphone ties if
you buy a Kindle book you can look at it
on your Kindle device your Apple iPhone
or Apple iOS device your Android phone
your PC or your Mac it's a very
cross-platform technology and Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble's doing the same thing with the
Nook but the Kindle was first and I
actually had a Kindle got the first
generation Kindle remember when we saw
pictures of this and everyone said
really hope that's a prototype device
because it's so ugly well since then the
Kindle has evolved tremendously to the
point where it's lighter thinner than
ever the contrast on the screen is much
better and the battery life is just
insane so without further ado let's
unbox the Amazon Kindle 3 now I also
have an iPad and we're going to compare
the size of the Kindle 3 with the iPad
but a lot of people including myself
find the iPad to be a very poor reading
device for many reasons number one the
glare is horrible when you're reading
outdoors number two of the pixel
densities not high enough to where the
text is very sharp
reading on the iPad for a long period of
time can cause eye strain and number
three of course the iPad is heavy
relative to the Kindle so holding in
your hand for an hour makes your hands
really tired of course you could set it
up in a case or prop it up on something
but you really want to be able to hold a
book in your hands
and the Kindle is extremely lightweight
especially this latest generation okay
let's unbox this we're also going to be
testing out these certified
frustration-free packaging from Amazon
hopefully that is true and it looks kind
of frustration for a treeless rip this
apart very beautiful display we'll
compare this to the first Kindle
extremely lightweight can tell you that
right now it is thin razor thin let's
see what else they include these days
Quick Start Guide with all of the
letters
talking about how to turn on I'm really
curious how this switches between 3G and
Wi-Fi if you can actually choose that of
course the first generation Kindle had a
switch on the back to turn on and off
the wireless radios and of course we
have a charger either for your wall
directly into the wall this is really
cool really slim you can unplug it and
plug it into your computer to charge
let's see what it's using micro USB
that's good the original Kindle used
mini USB nothing else in the box let's
put this aside and look at the Kindle
and turn it on for the first time okay
so here it is has some instructions plug
in your Kindle this apparently has one
month of battery life if you keep the
wireless connectivity off that is
incredible so let's take off these this
is the graphite it also comes in white
kind of has a soft touch rubber on the
back or plastic which makes it good to
feel in the hand we've got some speakers
back here let's see what else we have
around the device these are the new page
turn buttons placed a little better much
better than the original Kindle which of
course had the problem of when you
picked up the device you may have
accidentally turned the page because
these buttons were so close to the edge
I'm not seeing a button to turn on and
off the wireless connectivity
maybe that's done through the software
now I never had the original or the
Kindle 2 so we've got volume here and a
power button see what happens when we
flip the hit on such a lightweight small
device before we turn it on let's
compare it to the original Kindle the
Kindle one much different let's get a
bird's-eye view
okay we're higher up now and as you can
see that the difference is huge
especially in the thickness Department
the original Kindle was shaped like a
wedge so it was really thick on the left
and then very thin on the right but the
new Kindle the Kindle 2 and then the
Kindle 3 were very thin all the way
across it's about the same length here
in terms of width they are also about
the same but the new Kindle is a little
bit smaller let's compare it to the iPad
just for good measure here so here's the
iPad heavy bulky device next to the
original or the Kindle 3 you can see
that you could probably fit to Kindle
threes on the screen of the iPad
definitely a
much more portable device and that's
really what the kindle is intended to be
the ultimate reading device one function
although can go on the internet so let's
turn it on I think that's how you turn
it on you should probably read the
instructions plug in your Kindle slide
in there is power switch below and your
screen will refresh for a few moments
okay
something's happening well wait for it
to turn up and there it goes
the Kindle three also boasts much faster
page turns compared to the Kindle two
and compared to the original Kindle the
Kindle one the difference is going to be
night and day with the speed of page
turns the original Kindle was about one
second for every page turn which still
wasn't that bad
the Kindle three should be about a half
a second or even a quarter of a second
should mention that the Kindle one is
broken this dropped on the ground and
the screen just doesn't work anymore so
it's another reason I wanted to replace
the Kindle one with the new Kindle three
so let's let it boot up and the improved
contrast is really apparent that's
another advantage job between all the
generations the different generations of
Kindle devices they've increased the
contrast making the blacks blacker so it
looks even more like a printed page
while it's booting up just gonna plug it
in it's always good to charge an
electronic right out of the box give it
a full charge there okay let's see if
it's registered to my accounts my Kindle
account which already has well over a
dozen books downloaded okay so welcome
to Kindle I'm not going to read that and
a lot has changed since the first
generation Kindle so I'm a little bit
disoriented here let's go to whom of
course in the first generation Kindle
there was a home button here but now it
just says the word home and definitely
faster page page turns
although that really wasn't that good of
a test so let's try to sync this up with
my account I'm going to go into the
settings assuming the menu button will
do that
shopping kindle store settings looks
like it's got a new selection tool
okay good it's registered to me it's on
3G right now this is using 18 T's 3G
the original Kindle used Sprint's 3G and
we should be able to download some books
there goes archived items this is what I
want this d-pad is a little strange and
I feel like I'm gonna hit the button
below it accidentally hopefully that I
get used to that and here are all my
books so I can go to any one click on it
and it's downloading let's see how long
that takes and since I'm using the
Kindle application on multiple phones
and my laptop and my desktop I've
reached the number of license limits so
I'm gonna have to deregister one of the
devices in order to get this to work and
and once I do that and get a little bit
of custom to it I'll come back on and
talk more about the Kindle 3 and the
experience with it again just a quick
look and unboxing at the new Kindle 3
it's not a smartphone but it has
smartphone ties because the application
is available for pretty much every
mobile device right now so please thumbs
up this video and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
