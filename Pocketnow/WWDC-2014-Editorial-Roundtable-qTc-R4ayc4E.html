to some of you I wish mr. Anton dinajpur
with us today because uh he's the one
who's always at evening time at these
events i am hi meri behna from pocketnow
great to talk to everybody and we have
our editorial round table for everything
that was discussed at WWDC 2014 um
interesting as we were kind of expecting
more than what we actually got but that
doesn't necessarily mean that we didn't
get a lot the event was kind of
extensive and I felt that it was too
short for everything they announced
mainly in the features between OS 10 and
iOS and these are the things we're gonna
do this discuss today but let's go
through a rundown of the team that's
with us today let's start with our
senior editor mr. Joe Levi who just
dropped out right perfect timing well
we're off to it right though that's a
google hangout he got worked for he's
around somewhere we use some there but
ok mr. Michael Fisher are creative I
forget your title sorry you know
creative director actually I might like
a little better editorial director is my
real daddy I think reviewer in chief
would be more more apps I gotta be
honest I could tell you more about the
asuste padfone X and the LG g3 that I
could tell you about anything they
haven't the apple event today but that's
just where my brain is that so that's
okay I could to be well you are our
reviewer you're definitely going to be
reviewing a lot of the stuff that was
talked about today and there is jail
again hello mr. Joe Levi senior editor
how are you I've been better I'm at the
auto shop right now but glad to be with
everybody talking about stuff I love I
don't go ahead I see that you are I'm
not the only one on the team to rock a
sporty pair of LG tones I see they're
saving your butt on the street as they
saved mine last week yeah yeah i unlike
you think they're awesome all the time
though okay I think they're awesome most
of the time so I've gone through a lot
of changes little tree is our secret
editorial roundtable sponsor okay
obviously by Chanel creature and mr. are
our chief news editor mr. Stephen shank
how are you dude hey hey I'm well I'm
surprised you were able to come
dence everything that was announced for
iOS happen there was so much of it I
mean you're just saying a minute ago
about how much or how quickly they
seemed to go through everything there
was a ton of stuff it was one beat after
another feature feature feature picture
but we'll get to all that in a second if
there's a lot to hear about well why
don't you run us down initially through
a little bit of what we saw today first
of all the fact that if you were
expecting hardware everybody there was
no hardware it was just a software win
just like it's been for the last two
years I believe right um I think down
we're getting down to the wire rumors
started zeroing in this idea was not
getting any new hardware there was some
reports out I think from the New York
Times earlier today so civically about
the health book stuff that we got so you
know everyone was wondering if this
would be where we saw the iWatch debut
and rumor this morning was known as not
going to the iWatch but there's going to
be this sensor packed health book and
then i'll come a look around a little
later on in the year and that's pretty
much what we got a health book is going
to plug in to these existing wearables
is going to attach to third-party apps
it gathered that data it's just going to
sort of store together give health care
provider is a place where they can pull
on it so way more than health apps in
the past have been focused mainly on the
user interpreting their own data a
health book is really focused on making
this a legitimate medical application so
even if we can get the hardware that's
big there a salad we can get in the OSX
hardware either if you know I had to bet
on and I would have said that was the
more likely thing to arrive today in a
new macbook or something but the wait
for another day for that I guess so and
pretty much it you know health kit would
that be the final name is accurately
healthcare sorry oh you know it is
really like Game Center yeah it's really
a place where applications can integrate
services can integrate but they're not
obliged uh obviously nike be you know
Tim Cook is part of the board nike will
be one of the big players in healthcare
definitely um but you know they don't
have any hardware anymore so I you know
I guess the biggest question right now
is you know fine there are going to be
services and where
that are going to integrate but it's
interesting that Apple is not really
wanting to an iOS wearable don't you
guys think I was sorry I was juggling I
was juggling Joe muting a little bit
because he was we were getting a little
too much of his of your breeze sorry Joe
I've left them muting up to you now yeah
no I think that's interesting I i think
i'll pick you back on stevens comments
that once the event got to a certain
point once we realized how much Apple
was focusing on software at this thing
and as they typically do it a
developer's conference I've became
pretty clear I think relatively quickly
we're not going to see any any new
hardware and certainly not not i watch
hardware but I mean you're saying that
you're surprised that Apple is going to
open this up to to third-party hardware
not not built by them on the health
front is that what your question is well
usually Apple is the company that likes
to do everything Apple they don't really
like to add other people and you know
not necessarily because they want the
full piece of the pie but mainly because
you know not everybody does it right
right now the health the health of you
know the whole fitness thing is mainly
based on different types of fitness
trackers 111 fitness tracker can do
better things than the other none of
these are they are reliable to some
extent but not fully um so I'm just
surprised that Apple didn't come up and
say okay fine here's the perfect fitness
fitness tracker or health tracker and
this is what health book is going to be
based on usually Apple does things like
that you know they're not like oh we're
gonna integrate iTunes with your mp3
players know they built the mp3 player
and then they created iTunes yeah no
that's that says that's a solid point I
guess that is a little on the surprising
side I want health stuff pops up I leave
that to two experts like you because
they start talking health and stuff and
I'm just kind of like okay I've just
wake me up on move back into the stuff
that I you yeah there are cool things
like oh okay so we have the version of
iOS and those of you that were expecting
for an iPad pro and 40 expensive able to
webos 10 Yosemite like I think I got
that right it is mainly just a revamped
you didn't need not OS 10 B we could
reduce
some light yossi might not about to say
that ochsner was cool though um and but
you know OS 10 is really just a revamp
in design those of you that were
expecting for there to be an arm-based
based OS 10 that will work on a tablet
that's not happening there's no 12 inch
tablet nothing and then it's really more
of how OS 10 is going to integrate to
iOS we have a question for example here
on our Q&amp;amp;A that s when is Apple going to
bring the file system probably iOS 9
they're not going to just forget about
that not even Android is giving you they
are but you have to use third-party
applications to yeah I was surprised
that Microsoft ami made with the Windows
Phone 8.1 file manager because some
smartphones in general have been really
shying away from that'll aspects of it
that's a rising an apples not do exactly
and it's not happening but what we are
getting is iCloud Drive yeah and you
know okay so this is cool because I
cloud files on the Mac are terribly
handled it's a separate you I from the
finder and you always had this like
juggle all around and I would never use
iCloud because of that but now it's one
you I that's within the finder and then
on iOS you get to access this file
system from the cloud that's really what
you have access to and whatever you're
editing on iOS you can you know continue
doing on on the mac and and and you know
that's part that's actually the one of
the cool updates that's the exciting
thing for me hi Mia it's called
continuity as readily that that's a
separate one actually but tell us more
about it Michael you know i'm sorry i
thought that i was looking at my notes
while you were I thought you were you in
love jumped into it already but like no
continuity is really exciting because I
am as I say I'm in the middle of
reviewing the PadFone one of the cooler
things about that is you can do take
what you're doing on your phone and if
you're like I need a bigger screen for
this you don't have to go to a different
device you can just plug it into the
tablet and it's like oh it's bigger now
with this is nice because you can be
doing something on your iPhone and
decide you want a bigger canvas and the
process of opening on opening it on the
ipad is just simplicity itself you go to
the lower left corner of the screen you
flick up and oh wow this is exactly what
i was doing before and that translates
also to the desktop as well as your
honor no s10 machine running west and
we'd you can go up
little corner there and not only can you
can use tossed tasks back and forth you
can also do fun things like activate a
mobile hotspot without touching that's
neat looking isn't it isn't it yeah and
yeah and also like tiny little things
like your iPhone throws details about
its reception status and stuff right
into your status bar so like all this
stuff the way this stuff works together
is very cool in a macro perspective it's
like wow this would make my life easier
but it's also a it speaks to the larger
message of today which is Apple sitting
there saying we need to make it more
compelling for people to jump in
headfirst into the apple ecosystem and
just and just live inside Apple again
because I think it's been a couple years
since um since that's really been a
compelling prospect you know I like me i
have a macbook that i adore for desktop
work but i don't really want to get near
any of apples stuff on the mobile side
tablet or smartphone it's not very
compelling to me today's announcements
make it more compelling and I think they
will make more compelling for a lot of
people it's interesting I saw this as
making the mac side of things more
compelling for existing iOS users
piercer seeing if on the other side and
this is sort of drawing if you have a
Mac anyway from back into the mobile
Apple fold yeah I think it's doing both
and I you know I think that's that's the
intention because really I think there
was starting to be this sense that that
a lot of people were doing like I like I
I don't want to replace my macbook air
with anything however on the smartphone
side I'm like I don't really want an
iphone this sort suits my needs better
but this is making a strong case for
just dumping good jumping headfirst into
the whole Apple things and saying if you
don't have all Apple devices there's
something concrete you're going to be
missing out on and that's convenience to
over and over again every day you know
I'm kind of surprised I'm still trying
to understand how exactly what are they
going to use for me to receive a phone
call with my phone that's charging in my
bedroom and have the call fall on the
Mac how are they going to handle all
that that's probably you know one of the
biggest questions of how they're going
to pull it off because probably one of
the things I like the most about
continuity is that you know the fact
that why do I like my SmartWatch because
I don't have to look at my phone to get
my notifications and in the same way you
can get your notifications and your
phone calls in your Mac with
out the need of going to your phone I
love that you know you can just focus on
work and you don't have to be pulling
your phone to be responding to things i
like that i agree with you i mean that's
it's awesome and i put it about this
earlier it means it's something we've
been doing it's like the one reason you
can still be happy to have google
voice's that you've been able to do this
kind of crap for you literally years but
of course you in order to have google
voice you have to put up with a bunch of
stuff that that is the result of using a
service that really hasn't been updated
in four years so this is a very cool you
know extrapolation about that but once
again you have to have apple products
for the stuff and what we made a phone
call on stage today didn't way they
actually demo doesn't yeah hey dr. grey
it's just so fun I've been listening to
the first album the first the chronic
album for the past couple of days just
because dr. great yo I used to be a
victim's it's bumping is it good reason
of money nothing but a G thang dude I'll
tell you this it's put dre back on the
radar I mean even beats was had become
something more of just beast that beats
the no longer the word dre it you would
never hear beats by dre anywhere was
just beats beats music and it's like
putting the guy back into the spotlight
and yeah it was it was cool to see the
phone call and everything sounded fine
for beta obviously we are going to have
iOS 8 beta we are going to have a couple
of hands-on videos very soon of
everything obviously we really have to
test it i don't want to make a video
that just shows you oh this is it you
already saw it at the keynote you can
see it at the keynote of you are we
actually want to try to interact with it
and play with it a little and we also
are going to get OS than you sympathy
that's it right yeah yeah yeah sorry
guys sorry uh and people butchered my
name all the time and you know just see
how this all works how seamless it is
because you know Apple has tried to make
this whole just works mentality for the
longest time and some things have come
out really good like I club but then
mobile be was terrible so obviously we
will have contested people recommended
and there's there's so much other stuff
packed into iOS 8 though like III I
understood the reason for the version
bump in this one
in terms of features because we're with
iOS 6 X 2 27 we had a big UI overhaul
and when I saw that iOS 8 was being
rumored for today I was like I don't
really make any sense they just
overhauled the whole UI but so this is a
point jump based on feature is not based
on aesthetics and the the features are
are numerous and I'm like some our
favorite ones here keyboard friggin what
they not only just one keyboard
enhancement you have right right where
is the hard stuff and predictability
that's exploding my mind right there I
mean how long have we been waiting for
that when the notification screen yeah
some are putting little little custom
wickets in there I mean we mentioned
earlier the new API is allowing apps to
talk to each other that's huge Bassam
see what else other a can now be used by
third-party apps we can start using that
for like banking stuff to your
authentication with your fingerprint
yeah the new messaging features where
you can just really hit stuff and all
valued oh yeah yeah yeah yeah the voice
messages in video right so I mean
there's that kind of stuff and yeah you
can mute yourself you can take yourself
out of M&amp;amp;MS conversations that are that
are that get too long and like a lot of
the stuff is stuff that we've seen
another platform so you have all that
predictable feedback from the from the
community of logos forever but who have
iphones haven't been doing this forever
and people who don't want to leave the
iphone for another platform now have one
less reason to do so so that's why this
is so significant now let me let me ask
you this how big like for example in my
country SMS is not big how big is it in
your country Oh Gino oh here here what
we use is whatsapp and that's it you
know and all the features that were
announced for you know messaging are in
what's after the longest time I mean SMS
is is crucial here in the states i mean
whatsapp is like when facebook but
what's happened i don't not a lot of
people outside the tech circles knew
what the hell what's app even was you
know I if people want to talk here yeah
they'll use iMessage and stuff like that
but SMS is still the backbone of
communication and SMS has been pervasive
in the US for well over a decade by this
point I'm even though these other these
things do offer
are better features compatibility with I
mean um they can deal directly with the
big operating systems and then whatsapp
sort of avoided that whole thing but I
think most people I know still rely
heavily on SMS this is the new big news
to them hi May uh can I ask do we have
time to throw Joey well Joe just wrap
talking you through involved the
conversation uh changed it God you know
never I would talk to Joe because we
have a Q&amp;amp;A asking how Google will react
to uh to google i/o I know we mentioned
how google voice hasn't been updated in
awhile and there's sort of been this
this lingering talk about some big
changes to voice coming up with
integration with hangouts I wonder if
this might force Google's hand I mean
it's probably too late by this point to
make any big changes but if they were
planning some news at i/o about this I
think this just will EE enforced how
important that's going to be so they're
seen as you know staying one step ahead
of Apple now yeah Google and Apple are
probably at the same development point
on this kind of stuff i really expect
similar announcements at i/o because
we've been hearing about that google
voice renovation for a long time and
it's got to be coming at you and and so
i think we're gonna this conversation
that time a you asked about like about
you know what SMS versus third-party
messaging service how important is it i
think this is a conversation we can't
fully have until we see what google has
in store and i think it's gonna be I
think it's gonna be big now one of the
things that's interesting i don't know
if you guys noticed this like for
example the oh and one of the features
that's coming to iOS the whole app
integration from we in a one IP I from
one application to the other is like for
example pinterest can build their
application and they can use the sharing
module from Safari and allow me to share
something seamlessly without it the
necessity of going from app to app
that's what they're doing which you've
been able to do with Android for the
longest time true but this is new to iOS
and it is obviously optional to
applications but probably one of the
most interesting parts is like for
example if you want to translate a web
page there is no option for Google
Translate you can only use big and then
everything that was mentioned today was
big bay no Google you know every you
know they showed good
they showed maps it was Iowa's maps
which by the way we were expecting major
enhancements to maps and none of them
happened at this event unless you live
in China unless you live in China
definitely because I don't know why uh
but you know that's that's not happening
but then no Google prescence I wish Joe
is here but do you guys think about that
no Google what ya know Google pressings
whatsoever everyone was nothing that's
like with Bing search with Bing
everything they only mentioned mentioned
Google search once in the whole
presentation yeah well I mean I think
that's just further evidence of the of
the giant divide between Apple and
Google that's just going to keep getting
bigger I mean they're their direct
competitors in mobile and you know Tim
Tim Cook was thrown out some some digs
at Android like yeah they when they were
doing the OS 10 talk they talked about
Windows a little bit through a few jobs
but like the fragmentation talk with
Android and stuff like there you know I
mean this is Apple setting itself apart
from a competitor and do I feel like the
enemy of my enemy is my friend you know
we move was was pretty big here it's
like yeah Bing is not Microsoft is not
somebody we really have to worry about
too much in the mobile space right now
so we're going to go ahead and opted to
pimp their search service rather than
our more immediate indifferent the
subtle jab in a way isn't it I don't
know how to put it but I did quite a jab
yeah now the funniest chart was when
they were compelling the install base of
OS 10 yeah absolutely no it's 10
Mavericks to Windows 8 i'm like well
yeah it's fourteen percent of Windows
PCs but multiply that by the amount of
Windows species in the market compared
to the amount of Max in the market I
mean that chart was just completely off
clearly off but you know go ahead go
ahead well no no no no you your point
there i mean i was gonna I was gonna
move to another question from the Q&amp;amp;A no
far away far away well I don't want to
wait for Joe to get back on this one but
you know this is a question that I had
that I was talking to you about right
before we came on the air I'm areas
there is oh just just hold time all
right so Joe can you hear us cuz we got
a question tailor-made for you I could
hear you yet yes that is awesome news we
have a question from
Mike enamorado in the chat asking how do
you think iOS 8 will compared to android
personally I believe Apple has been
digging their grave with iOS 7 and many
other things so that the second part you
can kind of discard but I like this
question how will I OS 8 compared to
android I mean I Apple seems to have
installed a lot of feature colleagues we
do that last part again the only thing
you have to focus on dro is how do you
think iOS 8 will compared to android and
if you want you can ditch your video
feed so that your bandwidth is a little
less bandwidth e narrower and thinking
about it yeah bad Joe respected widget
live how about all this well it's still
a great time to be alive Joe ten years
ago in the pain can you hear me Blake
are you so yeah we can hear you but
we're time traveling in order to talk to
you we're talking into the past I think
we have a latency probably what's
written there's that yeah let's uh okay
yeah go Joe we gave it the old college
try we did indeed Joe I'm sorry we're
gonna have to dump you man this this is
a the cellular network that you're on is
not able to keep up with with what's
happening where we're not getting
anything from me I thought you said the
t-mobile network was good yeah probably
probably one of the biggest questions
that I want meant to ask Joe was this
whole new swift programming language um
I am not at the developer I am a
registered developer but I happy to
build my first application I'm everybody
we got to answer this first question
first oh sorry about that sorry because
I wanted to ask Joe that other question
but yeah how does it stack to Android it
looks a lot like Android I mean yeah I
was kind of sort of compiling a list I
mean we've we've talked about a lot of
it already but like you know the swapo
keyboards the widgets the
the enhancements to various parts the UI
that I mean it with the exception of the
grid as the starting point the UI you
know visual differences there's there's
precious little separating it from
Android at this point from a sort of
day-to-day usability I guess the
question is is this just catching up to
Andruw it or is this you know catching
up and improving upon I think it is
improving upon I mean if you are really
into I mean this just gave you a good
reason to buy a mac for example because
you know your phone in your tablet will
actually talk to the Mac much better
than ever and you know if you're within
that ecosystem you have less of an
excuse to leave uh and I don't know I
guess Android I wonder how well can
android offer something like this
outside of chrome that's a good point we
don't really talk a lot about the
android pc connection i mean in years
past there used to be all this reliance
on the pc side of softer for sinking but
in recent years everything's going to
the cloud and we don't really have so
many users connecting their phones to
their pcs for administrative tasks so
much anymore maybe backing up files but
that's about it so maybe apples really
on to something here with really wanting
all of their devices to be aware of each
other and you know constantly talking to
each other so that it allows for these
things that we've seen with
transitioning the apps from you know
laptop to tablet seamlessly so maybe get
right there it does have a vantage over
android yeah and Joe are you there dude
if you can hear me now I think I'm here
now oh we can here you dude what do you
think about iOS vs android now they're
getting a lot closer to one another
which tells me that we're moving towards
more perfection in in the overall
offering obviously Android now has some
catch-up to do which means we're in a
really great place because we have the
opportunity to see some new stuff coming
out coming to market hopefully sooner
than later but we're also seeing that
some of these features that Android has
had four years now are being validated
by the fact that their biggest
competitors offering them and not only
that but improving upon them giving kind
of a more seamless interaction that
Android it's been a little bit of rust
on the
now we have kind of a direction that we
can law you can go in a way we can
improve I agree Joe and we're starting
to see some some Android style
implementations of features here or
maybe that's not the right way to phrase
it maybe it's that Apple is returning to
its roots as sort of a trailblazer in
some of these UI things little things
like the improved mail app how you yeah
you could always swipe to the side for
more options but now if you swipe the
other way you can mark it as unread
something that I do all the time stuff
that like when you're drafting an email
if you need to hide it real quick to
look at something you can throw it to
the bottom of the screen do what you
need to do come back to it like it more
and more OS iOS is implementing features
in a very smart way to make it more
useful but also without compromising its
its visual sense of cleanliness you know
is something that reminds me of when
you're just saying there about what it's
doing you're visually differentiated
from Android we saw this um the
introduction of people into that
multitasking view I think that's
incredible and you would really be
who've Android to you know do something
similar it's great you know it's not
just the apps that you're using
regularly it's the people you're talking
to regularly and that's actually cool
because you don't have to look for the
phone application to call these people
or to interact with them and you know
you just simply do it from wherever you
are no matter what application I think
it's a cool way to use the canvas I
guess think my only disappointment and
we've got another question regarding
widgets yeah I osa it does handle
widgets but the problem is you can only
handle them if there is a widget
available and only from Notification
Center yeah you've got this endless
scroll of things they're gonna have
their you can stack them up in whatever
order you want but then again these
aren't you know I still am disappointed
with the fact that Apple wants to retain
the whole UI the whole grid and not do
something smarter with the endless seam
of application worried it's going to get
cluttered it's the problem yeah I feel
the targeted art is yes it already is
Joe before you before you go again
probably the other question that we have
here is what do you think of this new
swift programming language which plants
to get rid of the sea and you know just
make
objective is what they said at the event
I'm not a developer but you are well
when you talk about programming language
Objective C and Java the East program in
android aren't terribly dissimilar the
way you write the code that languages
themselves are very similar and if you
can read one chances are you can read
the other now that doesn't mean that you
can program in one and then
automatically program in the other
because they're different libraries in
my god Google is trying to do something
with their new development environment
to help simplify that helped raise it
higher to the surface I think that Apple
is not trying to do the same and I worry
a little bit i'll be the pessimists hear
that by so doing they're going to slow
down people who are already developing
things in objective-c and it will have
to convert over we'll have to rewrite or
at least slow down the developer so they
have to get up to speed in this new
environment telling you a joke go ahead
go ahead see how effective see can live
in the same app alongside Swift i
believe so that might help ease the
transition period yeah yeah and apples
doing some very smart things don't get
me wrong about that there are lots of
things they're doing to mitigate that
but it's still going to be a learning
curve still going to be something that
it's going to slow people down a little
bit training is over that hump you yeah
yeah once we get past that hump then
things will be a lot smoother a lot
faster I just hope that the people who
are coding in both and who are used to
both aren't going to be kind of given a
disservice here by now having to do
something completely different now I
didn't have the streaming video
available on my computer but those of
you who did see it what did you think of
that demo they showed with the
butterflies and stuff I mean rude I was
impressive I didn't say I was impressed
the guy pretty much built an application
in what what took him like five minutes
less than five minutes he both a full
pretty like a full game uh yeah it was
something like that I'm not sure I kind
of hopped off at that point is to start
preparing for this hangout but it's uh
you know I don't know I mean I I would
like a buttoned-up very succinct
explanation of what advantages
swift the swift programming language
brings to the table because I start to
sort of tune out after like 15 seconds
on that and I think a lot of people do
and I don't know I mean I what do we
think what implications does this have
for the future of vaio s versus the
other platforms well it's art because
the end result it says something like as
far as games are concerned we're going
to see a better access to the hardware
for lower latency of 10 times the detail
was thrown around so that's something
that is very real world that users can
cruciate sure yeah that was the other
thing that they talked about the whole
metal instead of a panel opposite open
jia instead of using opengl what they're
using is a new rebranded version of it
called metal and the whole idea is that
you know your games will now be able to
use more of the processor and less of
OpenGL and the whole idea with that is
like for example they showed us the PIPA
the desktop I don't know if that's the
desktop or the console version of plants
vs zombies play it on the ipad over the
a7 so i guess the whole concept is to
try to bring more constant quality to
mobile gaming i don't i don't know if
you're still there Joey can probably
give us a whole little idea on that well
yeah so OpenGL and affect any graphics
markup libraries there they're a
middleman there a library they let you
call things from code without having to
rewrite everything so you don't have to
reinvent the wheel that's one of the
things that makes those environments
those libraries strong is once you know
that library you know it you can employ
it wherever but there is overhead that
goes along with that you can do things
faster with your higher resolution so
with Apple doing this they've
essentially taken the industry standard
if you will and they've reinvented it on
their own to make improvements and to
kind of cut out some of the overhead
that's slowing things down from from an
end-user perspective you're just going
to see beautiful things from a developer
perspective you've got to learn how to
do with the new way to take advantage of
it I've got a I've got a question if we
can move away from from that for a
second I've got a question about asking
us to explain okay Siri
which or hey Siri actually which is a
pretty cool because when I saw this in
the in the slide I was momentarily
excited because you know the touchless
control on the Moto X has got a bunch of
us on the team pretty excited about the
possibilities for controlling your
device without even touching it but the
handicapped here is that Siri the iphone
needs to be plugged in and the use case
that Apple cited is in a car if you ever
plugged into a car charger you can just
say hey Siri and the iphone will wake up
and see you can interact with Syria just
like okay Google now on the Moto X the
thing is if this device needs to be
plugged in and that is a hardware
limitation as I understand it and guys
tell me from right or wrong here that's
just because there's no oh there there
is our limitation the the a7 processor
is I'll tell you this once it's
efficient on certain things it's
powerful on others but it's really
power-hungry when it comes to battery
life so it's not so much a harder
limitation it's a usage limitation
because you don't microphone dining on
you exactly exactly so I guess what
they're trying to do is just they're
giving you the option and you know
that's actually kind of cool then I mean
how how often do you want to actually
like for example have you had that
problem Michael where you're in a room
where somebody else has a Moto X and you
say ok Google and both phones respond
yeah because nobody has a Moto X in the
world noman but the thing is like I want
to use it all the time in until you've
used it regularly it's tough to explain
the utility of it it's sort of like
something like smartwatches of wireless
charging but any time I'm using a phone
that's not the Moto X oh that doesn't
have a similar capability it's it's like
irritating because it is so incredibly
useful and I was I was momentarily very
stoked about it and then I was like oh
wait we're we're confined by the door
constrained by the chip so it has to be
plugged in no just yeah for now and and
uh it was you know that that was a
missed opportunity of the very smallest
kind I'm not criticizing here I'm just
saying wouldn't it have been cool if
they had said yeah and you can use a
Syria and your current things and and
also by the way here's this new hardware
that you can say hey Siri anytime and
also by the way hey iPhone 6 anyway
football
I think that it's I think that it's
something that'll be that'll happen on I
on the iphone 6 up like for example
there are things i like about the a7 the
phone charges in a in a blast it's like
extremely fast charging um I mean I
could drive from here to the gym which
is like I think it's like not even more
than a 10 minute drive and I could get
easily fifteen to twenty percent battery
charge in that little portion of a drive
so there are cool things that I'm sure
that what they're doing is just
preparing the grounds for this to be a
feature on the iphone 6 most likely yeah
it sounds like just some a housekeeping
question guys's might have I been frozen
for like 15 minutes you're invisible
right 24like really terrific well that's
great news and also Joe I've had a mute
you remotely just joggled a toggle your
mute back and forth if you would cuz you
got some background noise going on there
but otherwise it's still good to have
you I'm glad you've lasted this looks
like a record right now Joe well I'm
just audio now I'm not video either so
that helped a lot yeah seriously but um
okay rulers don't be what else are we
mini what else are we missing uh really
good question Stephen taking a look here
my coverage here see what else was
mentioned taking I grabbed as well here
there was spotlight improvements though
elcome K the new a home connectivity
stuff yeah yeah that up i was hoping i
didn't miss that yeah go go I don't know
home kit again is the same thing as
health kit if there are people
interested it out there that are going
to want to build applications or
services that will integrate with iOS
than it'll happen the problem is again
this is not so iOS is not the only
platform in the market it's not the only
smart phone company so I don't know
exactly how big of an adoption there
will be for this because obviously this
won't work for Android at least not
initially I have a feeling that Apple's
got the ear of the I didn't know exactly
what companies are on the sly when I put
them up there it's got a the year of
some of these premium brands out there
so the companies that are making the
sort of things already then bring a very
expensive own door locks I had a keypad
or you can unlock them it was already
dedicated app those new the companies
that start building support for the
health kit health get home kit API so I
think apple will get a good share of
partners interested in building the
hardware for this I just don't know if
there's the demand there from users
right now I could like this whole
connected home stuff is hanging around I
mean it's been technically possible for
a very long while now there's hasn't
been a combination of interest in people
outfitting their home with all these
devices and the interest from the the
phone companies to make a really
comprehensive control way system from
this like apples doing here it might
take a couple more years before it takes
off I'm feeling it's going to be at what
smart watches are now but few years from
now there you've got the point there I
mean Joe try to remind me how far back
the google announced this at Google i/o
like three years ago yeah it's been a
while and we haven't seen anything there
but what we have seen is we've seen nest
come online and release two very good
product we have seen Google acquire nest
so they're already moving towards that
when I think we're going to see a lot of
this stuff you know we talked about
end-users we're talking about you and I
and power users and the people who are
watching this bringing in all of these
very expensive devices into their home
and we just don't see that the
plausibility of it but the other hand we
have these home security systems that
are building in automation that are
already building in you've got window
and door sensors you've got door lock
you've got cameras and whatnot they're
there they're taking that part of the
market that niche and that's something
that now we're going to start seeing
those features those those security
systems and whatnot is aren't going to
offer support for apple and hopefully
eventually for Android so look at it
from that perspective we've already got
people of security systems as they
upgrade they're going to be looking for
this Apple certification let's see we'll
see i don't know if that's gonna I don't
like for example carplay name one
vehicle that is driving right now with
carplay and car play was announced three
months ago
it takes a while to come up with new
cars on me no obviously you know even
pioneer has has been trying to build
this has been trying to build this into
their current dashboards and they're
having trouble with it I guess again the
further to be user adoption for there to
be om adoption manufacturer adoption you
kind of like for example what did what
did Apple do when they launched WebKit
on safari initially in 2007 they had to
open source said if not nobody was going
to develop and WebKit that was the
problem and that's the wheel that's the
only way they could solve it and unless
they figure out a way to create an open
source platform that will allow you know
these companies to build for both iOS
and Android I don't see it taken off but
that's my that's my opinion it's cool I
just don't see it taking off it needs to
be an open API so that we can do that
but we've seen how api's are all of
apple's chats and whatnot are not open
you can't talk from Android to apple and
do that very well let's hope that they
do better with help and with you know
one with this home fit to exactly i
overall overall you know i think we are
we've been on this on this hangout for a
bit and we're kind of running out of
time I don't know if we're missing
anything to talk about because overall
you know there's no hardware it's all
software and if we were expecting any
hardware it's going to happen in the
fall design services we haven't hit yet
the new photo stuff family sharing and
we danced on those I found this
hilarious tweet from sac uh you know he
was a frequent to the pocket now live
and he's like I don't want to share my
stuff with my family i'm appealing here
I'm like dude you've got it in that
that's it's cool these are cool services
but I don't you know I like that photo
editing feature that's coming um it's
it's cool you know it's non-destructive
editing and you know it syncs all across
your devices and you get the full
sharing and all its cool what else did
what else did well if they give it a
teaser of that new OS 10 photos app
that's not what you're talking about
right
oh yes true that that's that iOS and
then the OS 10 editor is going to launch
this next year but you can get it on
Iowa they betta awesome ya know so the
editor is one thing I'm sorry I was
thinking to the OS 10 the desktop level
stuff which just seems really cool
because you yeah you've got like the
week or whatever you can pinch down to
the month and then to the year and it
like arrange them in blocks and stuff is
it's nothing groundbreaking but it does
look really clean and I'm sad we have to
wait almost a year for it i think it's
it's going to be pretty cool when it
when it finally rolls out but that
editing stuff it was very cool to see i
think the most code a most important
point that was made there was like yeah
we'll give you the controls that you
need if you want to do manual tweaking
yourself but we're also making it much
easier so if you don't want to drill
down to that if you just want to like
play with this slider here you can see
what all the individual level controls
are doing some are going down some are
going up but ultimately really all you
need to do is do this and hey look the
pictures 40 times better and it's not
just some cranky later then it is not an
awful lot like Google+ photos right and
then their auto often so awesome exact
look but I thought I found it hilarious
that the guy was like you know this
photo looks a little done I'm like man
you're actually saying that an iphone
photo is dull that's great well yeah I
know but awesome like badly it was shot
with backlighting and stuff like that
and i like that it wasn't intentionally
done but no some of that stuff looks
looks really good what else is included
in the on the it looks good i guess the
only i'm surprised that this is not
going to be part of iPhoto that they're
actually launching a separate
application to get this done um yeah
well I mean I guess I guess that is a
little surprising the right because it's
going to introduce a little bit more
clutter because I photos going to stick
around right dude it's part of why it's
part of ilife so I unless they plan to
separated I don't know I don't know what
they're they're planning but what other
feature are we missing Stephen um I
think we hit most of the big stuff here
yeah it says if someone was asking us to
compare this one got a little bit of
traction I kind of like this question we
talked about it a little bit in the
coding but better graphics and games you
know I think some people seem to be
interested in whether iOS devices really
need that level of gaming support and it
would be my argument that you
I think I os's yeah iOS is also like the
forerunner in in offerings on in terms
of mobile gaming you know yes Android
has I don't know what the title
disparity is but Android certainly has a
lot of games but iOS has always been the
platform where if you want to do mobile
gaming and if you want your if you're
interested in the titles that come out
first like iOS is where to be so I don't
think there's anywhere else you could
put great gaming resources but on iOS
yeah this is like cementing apples
position even if they had no waiver in
recent years with Android getting you
know more titles has been less excusive
things this could help out all you know
get back some of that they gaming
gravitas as it were it could be kids I
guess my biggest question is how will I
os8 and i can't wait for the beta to be
available to download it how will it
affect battery life that's like the
biggest question that I have because
it's pointless for for you to be able to
do so many things with your phone and
have so much graphics integration if the
a7 chip is anything but it's anything
but efficient it just it's anything but
efficient so obviously this will have to
narrow down to yes you have all this
extra capability but what's the point of
your battery is going to die in three
hours I think yeah and my girlfriend's
telling with a similar issue right now
with her old iphone it seems like that's
always the case like I always see this
this obsolescence rear its head and in
the older generations seemingly more
severely than I see it elsewhere I mean
crappy android phones sure but I don't
know it's just maybe it's because I
phones are more prevalent but I am
always seeing I phones that are not that
old and performing really really poorly
particularly in terms of battery life
and I really like to see that change at
some point speaking of obsolescence any
thoughts on the lack of support for the
iphone for this time around its feelings
anyone i use an iphone 4 in my car music
and i'm just happy that it's not you
know it performs terribly with iOS 7 if
we have time guys for for just a couple
more really quick ones like 11 liner
answers i think this is a cool one
finally interactive notifications
android doesn't have it integrated with
the OS your thoughts please i don't
really know what that means
but the notifications that come down
from the screen and from the top of the
screen and iOS 8 where it's like oh I
can act on this notification right here
if it's a fly straight away yeah even if
it's just a like if it's a Facebook
comment on your wall and you can just
tap like and then you can throw it away
like I think that is really cool stuff
and it's significant and we should
recognize it because Notification Center
hasn't really been an all-star feature
of iOS for a long time it's just kind of
been this cluttered mess you know like
it's being used more intelligently now
you can do it a certain extent with
Android you know after jellybean you can
you know extend the notification and
reply to something but you're still
takin to the app right cool the cool
thing is here you won't have to go to
the app you know I think that that's
probably like one of the biggest things
that we've wanted I OS to fix for the
longest time not having to jump through
apps and apps and apps and I guess
somebody else tweeted there you know
it's it's it's hilarious how Apple is no
longer using the whole motto of there's
an app for that because now the
operating system the operating system
kind of does things without the need of
you jumping to the application because
by the way the way Notification Center
work is it's not really the application
is not really notifying you it's the
server so this is all working on the
server without the need of waking the
application up which is cool I think is
also noteworthy to talk about this in
the sense of innovation because you can
argue that notification center has
always been something that's been a big
catch up game for Apple it was extremely
late to the game with this and now it's
doing things that's going to make
Android users a little jealous to see
this smooth really tight ability to to
interact with these and like to say even
not even get replying is hitting a quick
like and it's it saves you maybe a
second or two each time you do it but
over the course of a day how many
indications do you get this is going to
mean no actual benefits to users either
I'm just checking out the the the other
kind of the QA here I was looking for my
final question here and I was
momentarily distracted by by the
question about what potato you're using
for your webcam stiva just telling me I
was this close to buying
make this decade webcam maybe next time
pronounce nugget a quarter vga I want to
say in in the in general and this will
be my last my last comment about the QA
some we have some great questions that
we have been able to get to it some of
them are more general not to worry the
pocket out live will be back at some
point and we'll be able to talk about
anything you want to talk about soon at
some point i think i may do you want to
do you want to take us home here yeah i
think we should we should start wrapping
up I you know there is a lot that's
coming with iOS 8 I again Stephen I'm
surprised we were able to cram
everything into one post and make sure
you visit parking now rather than that
because it's the full rundown of
everything that was announced I am
surprised that for the first time you
know iOS is you know they tell you in
every previous event they would be like
we have 200 new features but then they
only went through five today they didn't
have enough event to cover everything in
to the extent I feel that these are good
changes these are positive changes I'm
disappointed that there was no hardware
I'm disappointed personally you know
with the certain of the announcements
but you know before I go through my
final thoughts why don't we start with
Joe before we lose you do unmute you
want me to unmute now if you can hear me
yeah yeah yeah we can even what so what
are your final thoughts specially from
an Android perspective do you think that
Google needs a big hand with google i/o
in the next coming weeks no absolutely
you know we've seen and it's gonna sound
a little bit redundant but we've seen
very good improvement on the androids
notification shade we've seen some of
the stuff that you can do with the new
you know the new iOS 8 stuff but man
they leap from this big time and it's
awesome and it's great and now Google's
got to play catch-up I don't think we're
going to do SDKs and stuff at Google i/o
we'll see but that Apple guys we got
some catching up to do interesting
interesting how about you mr. Fisher
what do you think you know I wasn't
necessarily expecting new hardware so I
wasn't overly disappointed there's
plenty of 2014 left I think we will see
the the iWatch before the end of the
year and I think there'll be a time for
that but this needed this was here to
lay the foundation for that
and for where iOS is going in the future
and I really think this has I think this
has done a lot for the iOS versus
Android relationship but i also am I
can't help but think about what what the
hell windows phone is going to do
because we know Microsoft and i don't
mean overall like I'm not say I'm not
being gloom and doom about the future of
Windows Phones existence on saying is we
know microphone Microsoft is not the
fastest company to innovate on their
mobile platform and Windows Phone 8.1 is
great but now it's it's behind in a
number of way in a number of additional
ways it's not even out in your
availability yet right this is this is a
concern I mean legitimately this is
something something I'm worried about
and I think it's um I think there are
probably a bunch of meetings going to be
held and I really hope that in that camp
we see some faster development because
all this does is remind me of the things
I don't have on on what is otherwise my
frankly my preferred platform which I
like a lot so I think this I just hope
this serves as kind of a kick in the
pants to Microsoft and a you know get up
and and get get back to work kind of
thing you know it and it's sad to see
Joe jump off obviously most likely
because he didn't want to oh but you
know my final question to you Michael
because there was this big banner at
WWDC at the moscone center saying
Samsung prepare your photocopier was it
Korea or so I think whoa whoa really i
didn't see that repair your photocopier
so you know you you're pretty much like
out of the people that are in this
hangout i haven't used the gs5 i only
had it had some time with you know hands
on and everything but what do you think
you know from your perspective using the
gs5 using the the one m8 um will this
finally make you want to pull out the
iphone 5c and use it for a couple of
weeks no no not me personally just
because of that one aesthetic change
that was not made that we talked about
before the you know the the launchpad
for all your activities on iOS is still
you know the unremarkable grid of stuff
and sorry that's too bright another
overexposed but you know what i mean
it's it and it's still
I'm still confined to a 4-inch display
and it's going to be a great new
keyboard but it's still it's just too
small still so I'm going to wait it's
going to take some new hardware and
maybe a iOS 8 dot one to get me to to
maybe jump over for a daily driver but
that's just me and I'm just
answering a personal question so right
take that as my thoughts for how
everyone should behave thank you for
that man what's your what about you
Stephen from an industry perspective how
do you see iOS 8 yeah I was really
pleased what we saw today um a lot of
the changes had been revealed through
leaks but way more than that was new
stuff to us and I think the most
important thing about this everything
seemed genuinely useful and really
there's nothing controversial about this
with ios7 you had this new look to
convince people that they needed at this
you know flattening of the OS was a
change that they would learn to love
nothing iOS 8 I don't think it's going
to cause anyone to think well I'm not
sure Apple needs this it's actually the
right way to go they're just gonna you
know swoop this up and embrace it and I
mean really it's all Apple needed right
now which helps them to keep their lead
in the u.s. to try to make some inroads
on Android abroad um I don't really care
that we didn't get any new hardware
it'll come eventually but really great
stuff out of the WWDC today very pleased
with what we saw cool cool you know i'm
i'm mixed i am said that there is no
hardware but I guess my final thoughts
are you know ever since the launch of
iOS 7 even though there are bugs in the
operating system that we never saw
before there is this level of
functionality that keeps being added to
iOS that didn't exist before and I guess
that this this you know extra features
like being able to respond to a message
without having to jump into an
application have a smarter way to
multitask have a smarter way to contact
to reach your contacts you know for
those of you that haven't used airdrop
please stop you know comparing the whole
bluetooth file sharing you know compared
to iOS you know airdrop just blows
anything out of the water once you give
it a try so
Apple keeps adding functionalities that
Android had been adding they've just
been doing it in the smarter fashion and
certain things and in a not smarter
fashion and others so yeah just like
Steven I am I'm impressed by certain of
the things that are coming with iOS um I
will definitely have a hands-on coming
very soon again just give us some time
to be able to actually try these things
you know just to tell you yeah these
things are cooler these things you're
not because it's pointless for us to
just show you we just what you just saw
it the events will definitely have a
hands-on very sumos once we dig into
this very well yeah and to that point I
may there there's there's there's
already a flood of coverage out there
you are welcome to to partake in it and
some of it is really really excellent as
usual we are we are not first to the
table with everything so I've been
dealing with a tweeter to look what's
with pocket those coverage or it's like
well we're busy doing this and then we
have to do our hands-on zand stuff so
don't worry it's coming but you know
tell me it but we again we we don't
everybody can just show you what's come
on anybody could just flip up a camera
and tell you what you already saw at the
keynote we want to really attach these
things and tell you what things are
useful what things are not and you can
expect that coming very soon so overall
