absent services for Android I'm Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and these are
some google made applications that you
may not know about when you think of all
the applications Google is made for
Android your mind probably races with
all the apps that regularly make
headlines when they're updated gmail
hangouts YouTube calendar wallet and
most importantly Google search the app
that now envelops Google now but google
has been hard at work developing and
sometimes acquiring applications and
services that make the google experience
more complete especially for android and
there are quite a few applications in
Google Play that you may not know exist
all the important applications listed
above come pre-installed on most Android
devices but there are a few applications
Google developed that some of us at
pocket now install immediately upon
setting up a new device such as Google
keep translate or sometimes even goggles
but these apps just scratch the surface
if you open Google Play navigate to a
Google made appt like Gmail scroll down
and click more by Google incorporated
you will see every Google application
that is compatible with your device some
of you may already know about currents
especially if you are a user of Google
Reader and scrambled to find an
alternative Curren is sort of like
Google's own version of Flipboard and
magazine-style newsfeed for offline
reading if you follow a ton of sites
there are a few better ways to slice
through a backlog of reading than
currents if you're into fitness and
tracking applications my tracks is a
nice alternative to runkeeper it records
your jog and bike rides by way of GPS
tracking your path speed distance and
elevation for those online shoppers out
there Google Shopper aggregates prices
and products for many online stores to
help you compare prices and get the best
deals and speaking of deals Google offer
shows you all the local deals being
offered by the businesses around you get
a discount on your next car repair or
get a free trial at the local gym both
of these are great at helping you become
a more frugal shopper
gesture search is a shortcut application
which allows you to search contacts
browser bookmarks applications and music
it can be activated from within any
application with what is called the
double flip motion and to search you
simply draw the first letter of what
you're looking for with your finger this
can be very useful if you have a ton of
content on your phone but the double
flip motion does take some getting used
to if you're looking for some harmless
casual fun try Android if I choose
between hair styles colors outfits
accessories and shape and size to create
the Android ified you we've spent more
hours goofing off in this app that we
care to admit lastly if you are bored at
home on a Friday night you might want to
check out schemer when you log in for
the first time you get to choose all the
different categories that interest you
then you get the scheming essentially
this is a way to crowdsource your
activities to see what your online
friends are doing or have done and
likewise share what you've done to help
others come up with fun things to do
locally at home or otherwise
when you're bored and out of ideas open
schemer and some of the things you've
shown interest in doing will be
suggested I have no plans this evening
so i may check out Valhalla and
Charlotte that's going to do it if you
enjoyed the video be sure to click the
thumbs up button and subscribe and give
us a follow on google+ twitter or
facebook and pocket now I'm Taylor
Martin and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
