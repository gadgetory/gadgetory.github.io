style / Moto X pure / Moto X 2015 in a
separate video now it's time to see just
what's changed and what hasn't between
last year's Moto and this year's I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is a quick hands-on comparison Moto X
old-timey versus Moto X new hotness ok
let's get it out there the new Moto X is
bigger substantially bigger by 1/2 inch
in diagonal screen size and 24% more
mass that makes it look almost as big
next to the old Moto X as the Nexus 6
does and while the new Moto X doesn't
feel as big as it is it's definitely
gonna be an adjustment coming from last
year's offering which itself took some
time to get used to after the first Moto
X petite flagship lovers motorola has
moved on so let's all try to get over it
oh and the new display is a much higher
resolution quad HD versus Full HD and
it's IPS LCD instead of AMOLED if you
ask me the latter is a downgrade and the
former and unnecessary upgrade but we'll
have to wait for the full review to see
how all that shakes out on the brighter
side a bigger phone also means a bigger
battery 3000 milliamp hours versus 2300
and the older device the processor gets
a bump - from a quad-core Snapdragon 801
to a hexa core Snapdragon 808 a ram gets
a boost from 2 gigs to 3 and the new
Moto X offers an optional microSD card
slot which wasn't available on last
year's model the camera gets some love -
from 13 megapixels to 21 and the front
firing selfie cam also sees an upgrade
from 2 megapixels to 5 and it gets a new
wide-angle lens and a front firing flash
rounding out the relevant media upgrades
the new Moto X finally makes good on its
dual face grilles
it features stereo front firing speakers
instead of last year's mono
the Moto maker suite helped make last
year's Moto X one of my favorites for
its sheer customized ability and that's
been expanded with the new Moto X style
to the traditional wooden options and
Motorola has added textured silicone
rubber and Saffiano leather it's still
from whore wean but it's made using a
new stamping method that makes it more
durable and scratch resistant given how
quickly my older Moto X started to show
wear that's great news other changes are
minor to non-existent
there's improved LTE banding in the new
Moto X to support its out of box
compatibility with any US national
carrier and bluetooth gets a bump from
402 4.1 le more importantly for Wii
tactile people the trademark dimple
around back is smaller but still
pronounced enough to find it without
looking and on the software mothers
almost no change at all motorola seems
to think it brought enough innovation
last year to see it through another
whole cycle and while it's voice
commands and touchless controls are
certainly still very useful I've seen
how poorly some of them aged over time
and I'm concerned about the same thing
happening this year the biggest
difference of all taking everything into
account might be price whereas last
year's Moto X started off at for $99.99
the Moto X style will drop a hundred
bucks cheaper when it goes on sale this
September for a starting price of $399
that's a big reduction in the initial
asking price one year later and you're
getting much more phone for your money
this time around more importantly
motorola isn't just making a pure
edition available this year it's
emphasizing that unlocked carrier free
phone above all others which is a
significant shift in strategy we'll see
if it pays off and if the new Moto X is
worth buying when we review it later
this year for more from Motorola's event
