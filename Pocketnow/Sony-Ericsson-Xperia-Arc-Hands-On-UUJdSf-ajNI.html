take a look at the sony ericsson xperia
arc the cool thing about this phone is
that it's so thin and light it's
ridiculously like it's got this nice
part on the back it's got what they call
a reality display which means it uses
the Bravia Engine to sort of make the
screen look better although looking at
it right now it does look quite clear
and crisp it's not blowing my mind so
what's kind of bounced around here and
take a look it's interesting that they
put the almost like
mirror image of these buttons up here on
the screen but I'm sure they do
different things and they do that's kind
of cool animation allows you to move
around icons let's dive into the browser
and see what we've got here this device
is just so fin in life we're not going
to get any service on this it also comes
in this darker color
it's kind of slick let's see what
version
they still have remnants of the
timescape media scape interface but it's
a lot lighter than it used to be
finding it there may be a gopher
here that's progress
settings about phone android 2.3 so this
is running Gingerbread as you can tell
by the top battery bar here its overall
pretty cool device by the big story
here's how thin and light it is the
screen and
credible as they make you think and
there's some of those 3d really fancy
animations that Sony Ericsson brought
the table with the x10
remember that
2-inch to zoom
actually it is quite crisp and clear
there should be a setting
or the Bravia Engine see if we can get
to it here we
lay here it is Robbie engine okay so it
was turned on now it's off now it's on
maybe I need to learn a little bit more
sony ericsson xperia arc superb light
and very very very very fit android
smartphone
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
