expect the google nexus smartphone
launched more details on the blackberry
proof show was a very powerful camera in
tow and no I'm not kidding it seems that
Pepsi wants to build a phone I'm hi Mel
Rivera and should I be excited about a
possible Heineken phone this is pocket
out daily the official news today begin
with a Windows Phone that's actually not
made by microsoft acer has a pretty much
made more information official on the
acer liquid Jade primo and even though I
hate that name what's cool about this
phone is two things one the
specifications 5.5 inch 1080p display
three gigs of ram snapdragon 808 but the
coolest part is the fact that acer is
willing to bundle the microsoft display
port for you to be able to get continuum
without having to play for the port
which will add you an extra hundred
dollars up so that's good news let's
just see what it launches and those of
you that are saving up to the gear of
the arts launch to consumers happening
later in november well it seems that it
will not only be about games the gear VR
definitely did surprises as we tested it
out at mwc but it seems that the company
is actually working on different
partnerships and one of these
partnership is actually going to be hulu
so yeah if you want to be completely
obtrusive and not see anybody else and
just watch seinfeld on hulu i don't
think any of you watch seinfeld do you
but yeah that's actually going to be
available to you upon watch and for
those of you that joined us in being
stoked about the blackberry prove we get
more details on the product today and
the list of those for you'll find full
specifications on the phone but two
things were rather important number one
the price tag apparently it'll retail
for six hundred and thirty dollars or
its equivalent in string countries and
in addition to that it seems that the 18
megapixel primary camera is actually not
bad which resembles the past if you
remember devices like the blackberry
bold had very good cameras for their
time but obviously we will have to test
this out in our review and believe it or
not we are not providing any one with
April Fool's jokes right now we are
actually talking about the Pepsi phone
and yeah these rumors are actually not
new they've been in weibo over in China
for a while now but we kind of just list
them until now that we find a banner
with a Pepsi logo and impossible
announcement on October twentieth of a
very affordable phone around two hundred
and five dollars for decent
specifications but this is probably the
worst photoshop job that I have received
when it comes to that Pepsi text beside
the logo but hey set your calendars
rocked over 20 and finally the hot news
of the day have to do with google's
nexus smartphones particularly the Nexus
5x those of you that wonder exactly when
you'll be getting the product it seems
that that October date is actually
october twenty second now it says
october twenty second ready to ship so
it could be that ready to ship or in
your doorstep not really sure about that
but yeah and we can't wait to hear more
about the nexus 6p we can only assume
that the company will actually launch
both phones at the same time but it does
lead me to the question of the day
number one thing you choose either of
these Nexus products which one that you
choose and why in my case I am still
about ready to order the Nexus 6p I
think that I'm willing to do that but
leave us a comment down below I'd love
to know your opinion probably helped me
make up my mind friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video is still
wishing follow us on talking out our
comment subscribe trace each channel as
well and follow me on Twitter hi mauja
shkodra better on instagram at high
never data please give this video thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I am a
medley better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
