and it seems that the company's going a
whole glass as well yes the BlackBerry
key 2 was announced and buoyed there was
a lot involved and Sony may be up to
something really interesting with their
necks Xperia I'm Jaime Rivera and
yesterday's event was so crazy and
everything that happened just pretty
much made it so difficult to get you a
daily so I'm gonna compensate on
Saturday
this is bogging out daily the official
news today begin with deals as a well
the LGV 35 thank you
just barely launched on ATT and the
phone already launched on sale and great
because it was starting at 900 bucks
so you can get a second one by one get
one free but it depends on the
installment plan so you go for you can
learn more in the description definitely
it's a good phone it's just it was very
pricey at least until now now it's all
about Motorola as the company recently
announced it's the z3 play we have a
full hands on but in text you can see it
in the description
definitely the premium mid-range that
we've been expecting from Motorola which
is all great and everything
specifications are not bad the only
problem is when it's priced pretty much
close to the 1 plus 6 makes you wonder
why you would buy that over the 1 plus 6
you can learn Morgan in the description
I was talking about the BlackBerry key
to the event was awesome we were part of
it our hands on video is live you can
see it in the description I had a lot of
questions in the comments over my
impressions of what it's like to move
back to a blackberry and hey in my case
I will tell you this much the key one
was a good phone there were a ton of
things that weren't going for it and it
wasn't because of the processor or
anything I feel that it was the design
so I loved the blackberry fix the design
on this launch I'm really looking
forward to this review period because
this is a good candidate for a phone
that will always be with me now let's
talk about Sony and the company's xperia
x z3 we're not sure if this is going to
be the XZ 2 premium which we were
thinking was going to be but
specifications are high on the roof
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 along with 6
good bytes of RAM probably the most
important part is that Sony is pitch
to make this phone a lot slimmer I have
the xz2
I don't know what it is about that xz2
that I actually like because it's not
the best design phone and still it's a
very pretty phone even if it doesn't
follow a lot of the trends lately so I'm
looking forward to the next xperia and
let me know in the comments who's
looking forward to that review we
thought we weren't gonna get a unit but
we did and sure we could definitely do a
really find that interesting and finally
the most interesting news today I have
to do with the Google pixel 3xl I
believe as we've got some leaked renders
of the phone that share two important
things the first one is the notches up
there apparently there's no way around
it unless you go for the smaller pixel 3
which apparently will not bring a notch
but the most interesting part is the
fact that the back even though looks
like the pixel 2 apparently is not it
seems that there is a matte finish and
mixed with a glossy finish and the matte
finish being like what we see on the 1
plus 6 but it's still a full glass back
would it be for wireless charging or
whatever the case in today's question
let us know what do you think would you
like for the pixel 3 to go all glass or
will you prefer it to stick to the
current design which is part of lumen 'm
in my case honestly i don't care about
wireless charging so for me I would
prefer the aluminum build I actually
find it to be a lot lighter than a ton
of the phones in that size but that's
just me and my opinion leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
