pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a look at the hardware on the lg
optimus 3d the smartphone is coming to
AT&amp;amp;T as the thrill 4g and it's not
pretty sure why a TNC chose to market
the 4g capability instead of the 3d one
but hey it's their choice and we're
going to take a look at LG's first
glasses-free 3d smartphone which was
launched in Barcelona this year the LG
optimus 3d stay tuned for the hardware
tour
okay so let's take a look at what we
have here we have a battery which is one
of 15 hundred million powers that's
right and right behind the battery cover
you will have a sim card slot and a
micro SD card slot the LG optimus 3d
does not come with a micro SD card
instead it comes with 8 gigabytes of
internal memory this is what you see
behind the battery cover ok let's
continue with what you cannot see the LG
optimus 3d has a dual core texas
instruments omap for processor which is
helped by a power vr sgx540 GPU in
addition to those we've got eight
gigabytes of internal memory which is
the reason for why LG didn't ship the
Optimus 3d with a microSD card but from
the eight gigabytes you will have
available free approximately four four
and a half depending on what games you
have pre-installed on the phone and
let's take a look at the device right
from the front you have a speaker grill
right above the LG branding with a 1.3
megapixel camera for video calling and
I'm not sure you can see yeah that's
right there you have the proximity and
the light sensor at the bottom you have
the four capacitive buttons which are
typical for Android one for the menu 14
home 14 back and one for search and we
let the display behind because this is
the unique feature of the LG optimus 3d
it's got an LCD wvga 480 x 800 pixels
resolution glasses free auto
stereoscopic display it will not play
back in portrait mode because of the way
the technology works by interpolating
the left and the right channels of the
video but it displays glasses-free 3d
content ok let's get to the top of the
phone it's got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and a power / standby
button in addition to a secondary
microphone for noise cancelling
on the bottom you got your main
microphone which records your voice and
this is the place where you can pop off
the back the right side sports a rocker
for volume up and volume down plus a to
d / 3d button unfortunately this doesn't
act as a shutter release button it only
switches between 2d and 3d modes on the
left side you have a micro USB port for
syncing and charging which is covered by
a plastic latch right there and right
below that you got your micro HDMI or
mini HDMI port this way you can connect
the lg optimus 3d to an external display
and if that display is a 3d enable
display it will playback content
recorded with the lg optimus 3d in 3d on
the external display getting at the back
you have your dual 5 megapixel
stereoscopic cameras two lenses for
recording 3d content this camera records
1080p video if recorded in two
dimensions and 720p video if recorded in
three dimensions right there you will
have your LED flash which works pretty
good and right below the 3d stereoscopic
text you had the speaker grill for
speakerphone or listening to music so
this was it for the LG optimus 3d
hardware tour the supporter is coming up
shortly if you've enjoyed this video or
if you like the LG optimus 3d please
give us a thumbs up this wasn't on the
United Front pocketnow.com with the lg
optimus 3d hardware tour thank you very
much for watching
