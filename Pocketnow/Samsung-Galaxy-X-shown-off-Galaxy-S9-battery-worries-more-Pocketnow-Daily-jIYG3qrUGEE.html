its foldable smartphone designed to
people at CES other reports show that
Samsung's Galaxy S 9 might not grow much
when it comes to battery power and as
crazy as it may sound it seems that
we're not getting an LG G 7 at all I'm
high metal II that I have reporting from
my last day in New Orleans little time
off after CES which was crazy
this is parking out daily the official
dish today still don't begin with deals
were actually waiting for those still
but let's talk about the new HTC u 11 I
which just got announced those of you
that were waiting for the plus again as
we discussed last year and that's still
not happening we've got pretty much a
premium mid-range er here to a certain
degree we've got well a 6 inch 1080p +
display because it's wide we have two
5-megapixel selfie shooters which are
supposed to provide bouquet effects and
a different variety of ways and
specification z' don't look terrible but
they don't look great either it's a $500
smartphone so that's not necessarily
that bad you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about 2019
because now it's closer than it's ever
been
2019 is apparently going to bring us 5g
as we currently transition into gigabit
LTE and then 5g and apparently the first
company to bring us a smartphone that's
capable of Phi G is one of the companies
that provides the spectrum ZTE we hear
that the company is gearing up for
something really hot at early 2019
stay tuned for 5g now for those of you
that have been waiting for the
next-generation G from LG meaning the g7
which was rumored to be the g10 well the
company's CEO has pretty much put
production on a halt or at least plans
on halt for the g7 according to a very
trusted source we heard last week that
the company was going to rethink its
smartphone strategy apparently it starts
with not launching a smartphone at MWC
and this is going to be a major deal as
it would be a first for LG to not
participate we're hoping that that's not
the case but my guy you never know the
company is not really doing much right
now a company that continues doing a lot
is Samsung with its Galaxy S lineup
galaxy s 9 is coming up we've heard
specification z' but for those of you
that wanted this great battery life that
we've always dreamed about in Galaxy
phones and don't necessarily get well
the source claims that were only getting
the same batteries on the galaxy s night
and that's 9 plus 3,000 and 3,500
milliamp hours and we were expecting I
don't know something new mainly because
the architecture is apparently not
changing its remains at 10 nanometers
second generation according to sources
at Qualcomm but yeah don't expect that
to change anytime soon
we'll see and finally the very hot news
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
X that foldable smartphone concept that
should see the light of day someday
hopefully mainly because the company has
apparently already shown it off to
people at CES 2018 for its opinions and
obviously these are VIPs carrier
partners etc etc not exactly sure what
we're getting here but it leads me to
the question today if you were Samsung
when would you launch the galaxy x what
do you think the time frame should be
for this smartphone in my case I would
launch it with the Galaxy Note later
this year not early as the best
smartphone was usually get launched by
end of the year but that's just my
opinion leave us a comment down below
