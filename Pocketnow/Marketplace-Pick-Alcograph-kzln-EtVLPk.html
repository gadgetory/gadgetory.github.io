paki medicom and today I'm su alco graph
2.0 and what this actually does is can
calculate the alcohol inside of your
bloodstream if you've been out drinking
or whatnot so when first thing we're
going to select our sex so I have mail
here and we'll also need our weight it
is in kilograms and actually everything
on here is in metric so you will need to
calculate our kilograms just take your
weight and divide it by two point two if
you're calculating in pounds and that
will give your estimate kilograms so I
have it set to 80 right now okay so the
first thing you want to do is select the
time you start drinking so let's say
that you start at six o'clock in the
evening six to seven and it goes by an
hour increments of six to seven and then
you want to calculate the quantity let's
say you have five ounces of lets see
spirits or hard alcohol forty five
percent or so calculate that and let's
say from seven to eight you had let's
say 12 ounces of beer and calculate that
and then eight to nine eight to nine
okay there we go let's say you have a
five ounces of wine after let's see then
let's say from 10 to 11 or nine to ten I
guess it should be let's say you have a
meal so we'll just skip that will
calculate a meal here and then 10 to 11
let's say it's time to go out and party
so you have a let's say three ounces
about about a shot and a half or so of
hard alcohol again and as you can see on
this graph up here will actually
calculate how long it will take in order
for you to become sober now this is the
course is just a rough estimate you
shouldn't rely on this if you're going
to be driving or anything but it does
say that the maximum alcohol
concentration is 1.5 grams per liters so
that equates to point one five zero on
the alcohol and in the United States is
actually point zero eight or in most
states actually point zero eight is over
the legal limit to drive now we can also
go to more
and this allows you to save your history
so over the amount of time that we had
been drinking we consumed 120 grams of
pure alcohol so we can say that to our
history if you want so 120 grams added
to history in January and it also shows
you how many chalo calories are actually
inside of 120 grams so it's about 900
kilocalories so i'll just go back and we
can go to menu and this is also where
you can reset you can change your
options so if want to have it in french
i can also do that i can delete my
history or i can increase the amount of
that can increase the beer of eleven
percent so most alcoholic beverages most
beers i should say in the united states
around five percent or so so harder
alcohol so harder beers of other
countries you can change it on here can
also use ounces as volume units so
instead of using grams which or
milliliters in most other countries you
can actually use ounces the United
States you can also change it to the
legal limit so right now I have a point
zero eight because that's what it is in
the United States Canada Ireland the UK
whatnot and in other countries of course
it's point zero five and then in very
strict countries it's point zero two so
just go back so this is alko graph 2.0
and application does cost a dollar
ninety-nine cents on windows mobile
marketplace so this is another
marketplace bakeware you pick some
useful and interesting applications on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
