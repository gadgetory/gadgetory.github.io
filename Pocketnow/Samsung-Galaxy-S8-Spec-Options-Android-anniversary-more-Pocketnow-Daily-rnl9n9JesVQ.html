processor and improvements were slammed
that Apple is ready to compete with the
Amazon echo and as Android turns eight
years old prepare for some gifts I'm
high metal iveta ready to celebrate my
brother's birthday even though we're
actually celebrating early happy
birthday buddy this is parking out daily
brought to you by Autodesk graphic
official loose today start with Google
as the company has begun teasing the
fact that it turns eight years old
tomorrow and that it will be offering
some gifts now these gifts are not
really specified yet you should
definitely set up the check what Google
is about to offer its amazing Android is
eight years old it's been a crazy time
but it's an amazing time it's well it's
great to see how Android has evolved
from what it was with the g one to one
of this today a lot has happened to date
as will the spotlight over to Apple as
the company is apparently already
getting ready to compete with Amazon and
something we know that the Amazon echo
speaker is more than just a speaker it's
pretty much a home automation system if
you wanted to it could even help you buy
stuff yada yada yada and apparently
Apple wants to take its home kit project
to the next level rumors claim that
there is already a prototype to compete
with the Amazon echo though keep in mind
Apple does a lot of prototyping now
let's put the spotlight over to Samsung
and then continue on with Samsung pretty
much for the rest of the day because
there are a ton of new starting with the
Galaxy Note seven so replacement units
already out and in Korea there are some
complaints no phone has really exploded
but what we have here are apparently
phones that don't charge whenever they
go below ten percent apparently others
loser charged very quickly and son have
overheated so we cannot wait to see what
happens with these US units I cannot
wait to replace mine and tell you more
about it now speaking of the galaxy note
7 and moving the spotlight to the galaxy
s7 for those of you that like grace UX I
am one of those that really really like
samsung's new approach to software
apparently we will be getting this new
user interface on the nougat update now
the problem is that Samsung doesn't
really do a good job with software
updates particularly with their s
lahaina sometimes making you wait up to
a year plus all the carrier hurdles and
everything but yeah you'll apparently
get it someday
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the samsung galaxy s 8 we
already got rumors on specification
starting with the Exynos 88-90 5
processor and if you're asking how are
we going to move from the awesome 88-90
to the 895 apparently we're getting a
new Molly g71 GPU that's supposed to be
amazing obviously we're gonna have to
test that out but apparently also the
rumors claim that there might not be a
snapdragon 830 processor on the
smartphone it makes a lot of sense ever
since that 88 90 people have been
complaining that the snapdragon 820
doesn't really perform as well so it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that it's a good move for
samsung to remain on X and O's
processors for the s8 or would you
recommend variety with the Snapdragon in
my case I would love to see the day when
we get things inverted the United States
gets the 88 90 and then the snapdragons
go elsewhere but hey it was a comment
