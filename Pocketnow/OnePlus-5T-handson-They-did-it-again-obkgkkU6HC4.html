that's taken much of the spotlight when
it comes to rumors these last few weeks
and also the best smartphone you can buy
if you match the overall package per
dollar reporting from New York City I'm
home it'll be better with pocket now and
let's go hands-on now you know me I love
unboxings in the care package the
company has sent us includes a fancy new
box included we have the retail box that
you'll be getting in addition to a batch
of oneplus covers and definitely
sandstone is my way to go the device
packaging includes the standard new
smartphone a case stucked into the
literature packaging and the company's
famous - Arjun plug in the USB C cable
now the 1 + 5 T is definitely a refresh
to the oneplus 5 but not in the way of
the 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 T that was mostly a
spec bump where this is mostly about
looks and features the display now
adapts to the current trends of an 18 by
9 aspect ratio with a 6 inch OLED at
1080p and the 90.5 screen to body ratio
this has required the full adoption of
software navigation buttons that you can
fully customize and the placement of the
ceramic made fingerprint scanner at the
back oneplus is also launching its own
face on lock feature that it claims is
faster than any service out there using
over a hundred identifiers x' on your
face it also won't work of your eyes or
close though if you're looking for a
more secure option oneplus is claiming
that you should stick to the fingerprint
scanner you have the same snapdragon 835
processor with options of 6 or 8
gigabytes of RAM and options of 64 or
128 gigabytes of storage with dual-sim
capabilities and a 3300 milliamp hour
battery there is still no I'd be rating
sadly for water and dust resistance but
according to the company the phone is
designed to survive your standard
accidential splash of water without a
problem
powering the show we have oxygen OS
version 4.7 that is a snappy fluid and
customizable as ever it includes a few
new features with my favorite being
parallel apps that allows the
duplication of certain social media
services to help you log on with more
than one account and one plus is also
enhanced services like whatsapp for
their voice messaging feature to sound a
lot more crisp now probably the most
interesting update is to the camera
instead of the usual telephoto
monochrome or wide-angle secondary
sensor both cameras are RGB with the
same focal length of 27 millimeters one
would 16 megapixels @f 1.7 aperture and
1.1 2 microns the other would 20
megapixels @f 1.7 aperture and with
standard microns so yeah we do have
different sensors here oneplus claims
that this will provide more fluid zoom
through software in addition to a better
portrait mode and all without being
affected by low light which is the usual
problem with other competitors and then
yes the selfie cameras of 16 megapixels
that have two aperture the pricetag has
also received a minor bump at 499 and
559 depending on the model you pick and
I'm gonna have to agree on the word
minor given all you're getting with this
upgrade but obviously these are just our
first impressions all of this material
will have to prove through our review
