continue Android 4.3 spotted and not 5.0
as we thought and Google now reaches iOS
wait what I'm primarily vana and yeah
you bet I just pulled out the iPhone
from the drawer
this is pocket out daily but with the
launch of the galaxy s4 shortages were
expected and they did happen I mean
t-mobile had to push their launch and
sprint pretty much run out of stock
immediately so apparently you've sprint
is fixing the problem we still have no
word on t-mobile but we will keep you
posted on the news now on an interesting
note and kind of- if you could call it
that way people didn't really care about
the textiles and the whole NFC
functionality of the galaxy s3 in
previous devices but now sadly the tech
tiles one don't work on the galaxy s4
because there's a new chip on board so
Samsung what am I supposed to do with
these things I mean what sell them
apparently have to buy the text house 2
now anyways and let's continue talking
about Samsung we've now got some rumors
of the Galaxy Note 3 yes the galaxy mega
let downs were not the Galaxy Note 3 and
well now apparently we will have a 6
inch device that will be rocking the
Exynos 5 octa along with three gigabytes
of RAM and for those of you that are
wondering just how good would it be for
us to have that Exynos 5 octa well
Michael Fisher has just got his hands on
the Exynos 5 octa version of the galaxy
s4 snow hit the links in the description
for his video now let's talk about Sony
and I'm actually dreading this because
this company has the weirdest code names
for their products that you could ever
think of
first of all we've got the Sony 2
Garrido gotti or whatever you want to
call that thing which apparently is a
new phablet that Sony's building with a
6 point 4 inch display 1080p and
apparently this will look a lot like the
Xperia Z only it'll be much bigger and
then we've got the Sony onami or Honami
or whatever you want to call that thing
which would be more of a mid tier device
but apparently what's cool about these
new phones is that there will be a new
trial ooh meais display coming to these
new phones hopefully because the current
experience has terrible terrible
displays but I wouldn't wait for these
phones just now most likely an IFA Aoife
in Berlin
let's talk about Android for those of
you that were waiting for Android 5.0 to
be released at Google i/o next month
which is just next the next couple of
weeks
well apparently we've got some server
logs of Android 4.3 jelly bean not
Android 5.0 key lime pie effects to
wonder what Google is planning for their
event as most of us that feel that iOS
has already stale and dated also feel
the same about another version of
jellybean for the pretty much third
event in a row a third year it's only
been less than a year since jellybean
was launched and still we do want to see
something new coming out from Google but
sadly that probably won't be the case so
stay tuned for the news and finally for
the hilarious news of the day Google has
just launched Google now for iOS no I
didn't say that wrong I didn't say Ice
Cream Sandwich I didn't say gingerbread
and I didn't say Froyo I said I Oh s
it's been rumored for the longest time
that Google was working on a version of
Google now for iOS but we didn't think
that they'd launch it for iOS and not
launch it for their legacy hardware I
mean think about it if you have an
iPhone 3GS that was launched four years
ago you could run Google now on that
thing and you can't do that with the
nexus one that was launched at the same
time it's kind of ironic and sort of
stupid but anyways that leads me to the
question of the day how do you feel
about Google's move I mean the crown
jewel of jelly bean the crown jewel of
Android what made me love Android was
really Google now on jellybean and as it
turns out now I can have an iPhone and
pretty much have the well typical
functionality not necessarily the same
one but I could have these services come
to iOS and not have to buy another
Android phone since I know a lot of
you're still stuck on Ice Cream Sandwich
a lot of you're still stuck on
Gingerbread so leave us a comment down
below how do you feel about Google's
move I honestly am frustrated of course
it's always for an earlier Skoob of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and cell growth machine
