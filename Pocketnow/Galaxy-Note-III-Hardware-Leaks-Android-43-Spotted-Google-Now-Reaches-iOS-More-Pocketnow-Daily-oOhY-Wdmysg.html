continue Android 4.3 spotted and not
five point 0 as we thought and Google
now reaches iOS wait what I'm hi Mary
Vanna and yeah you bet I just pulled out
the iphone from the drawer this is
pocket now daily but with the launch of
the galaxy s4 shortages were expected
and they did happen I mean t-mobile had
to push their launch and sprint pretty
much run out of stock immediately so
apparently you sprint is fixing the
problem we still have no word on
t-mobile but we will keep you posted on
the news now an interesting note and
kind of negative if you could call it
that way people didn't really care about
the tech tiles and the whole NFC
functionality of the galaxy s3 in
previous devices but now sadly the tech
tiles one don't work on the galaxy s4
because there's a new chip on board so
Samsung what am I supposed to do with
these things I mean what sell them
apparently have to buy the textiles to
now anyways and let's continue talking
about Samson we've now got some rumors
of the galaxy note 3 yes the galaxy mega
let downs were not the Galaxy Note 3 and
well now apparently we will have a six
inch device that will be rocking the
exodus 5 octa along with 3 gigabytes of
ram and for those of you that are
wondering just how good would it be for
us to have that Exynos 5 octa well
michael fisher has just got his hands on
the Exynos 5 octa version of the galaxy
s4 snow hit the links in the description
for his video now let's talk about sony
and i'm actually dreading this because
this company has the weirdest code names
for their products that you could ever
think of first of all we've got the Sony
to garrido Gotti or whatever you want to
call that thing which apparently is a
new phablet that Sony's building with a
six point four inch display 1080p and
apparently this will look a lot like the
Xperia Z only it'll be much bigger and
then we've got the Sony Honami or honami
or whatever you want to call that thing
which would be more of a mid-tier device
but apparently what's cool about these
new phones is that there will be a new
trial looniest display coming to these
new phones hopefully because the current
Xperia lineup has terrible terrible
displays but I would wait for these
phones just now most likely an IFA Aoife
in Berlin now let's talk about Android
for those of you that we're waiting for
android 5.0 be released at Google i/o
next month which is just next the next
couple of weeks well apparently we've
got some server logs of Android 4.3
jellybean not android 5.0 key lime pie
effects to wonder what google's planning
for their event as most of us that feel
that iOS has already stale and dated
also feel the same about another version
of jelly bean for the pretty much third
event in a row a third year it's only
been less than a year since jelly bean
was launched and still we do want to see
something new coming out from google but
sadly that probably won't be the case so
stay tuned for the news and finally for
the hilarious news of the day google has
just launched google now for iOS no I
didn't say that wrong i didn't say ice
cream sandwich I didn't say gingerbread
and I didn't say froyo I set iOS it's
been rumored for the longest time that
Google was working on a version of
Google now for iOS but we didn't think
that they launched it for iOS and not
launched it for their legacy hardware I
mean think about it if you have an
iphone 3gs that was launched four years
ago you could run Google now on that
thing you can't do that with the nexus
one that was launched at the same time
it's kind of ironic and sort of stupid
but anyways that leads me to the
question of the day how do you feel
about Google's move i mean the crown
jewel of jelly bean the crown jewel of
android what made me love android was
really google now on jelly bean and as
it turns out now i can have an iphone
and pretty much have the well typical
functionality not necessarily the same
one but I could have these services come
to iOS and not have to buy another
Android phone since I know a lot of
you're still stuck on Ice Cream Sandwich
a lot of you're still stuck on
gingerbread so leave us a comment down
below how do you feel about Google's
move I honestly am frustrated of course
it's always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in Zelda Roma she follow us

YouTube channel you can also follow me
