fourth-generation ipad we go hands on
the samsung galaxy note 2 for t-mobile
and the HTC j butterfly is now being
dubbed the droid DNA I'm hi meri behna
still debating whether it's an ipad 4 or
an ipad mini and this is parking out
daily that's right t-mobile has just
launched their samsung galaxy note 2 my
review is already live it's great to
finally find the smartphone that doesn't
compromise in any way when compared to
its international variants the note 2
brings the same quad-core processor and
everything but sadly LaRue wasn't
perfect so make sure you wash it and see
how tmobile blends with the galaxy note
2 I don't think the match is really
perfect now speaking of the note 2 we've
already got leaked images of the verizon
Varian coming soon but i'm trying to
understand what's all that Verizon logo
on the home button talk about bad taste
now we still don't have confirmation
sword a test to when this device will be
available but as always Black Friday is
the day and for those of you that we're
waiting for the verizon variant of the
LG optimus G we've just got some leaked
images of the LG spectrum too but wait a
second the reason why I'm saying this is
because this is not the variant of the
optimus G coming to verizon this is
actually just the dual core smartphone
that has some good specs it's got a 4.7
inch display with 720p resolution though
sadly since the spectrum one
disappointed I can't expect much from
the spectrum too so we'll keep you
posted now the HTC J variant that's been
rumored for verizon was first called the
HTC DLX then it was called the HTC di X
and now it's being called the droid DNA
now I have no idea what the DNA stands
for but I honestly don't care the cool
thing here is that we've already got a
release date being planned for
thanksgiving apparently for 300 bucks
after a two-year contract if you ask me
with all the specs on this device the
first 1080p display and everything I'd
pay 300 bucks for that and finally for
the hot news of the day Apple has
finally announced their ipad mini which
matches every one of the rumors that we
saw recently now this device brings a
beautiful design though sadly the specs
are a little bit more into the budget
side though that was expected but sadly
the price tag at 329
budget at all now something that was
totally unexpected was a
fourth-generation iPad sporting an a6x
processor and also better specs when
compared to the current generation ipad
3 and that leads me to the question of
the day I've had many or iPad for what
are you getting this holiday season the
pre-orders start on the twenty-sixth and
honestly I still can't make up my mind
so leave us a comment down below now if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
Parker now calm please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi many better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
