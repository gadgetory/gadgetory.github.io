smartphone tablet Hybrid is growing no
longer confined to super high-end
devices with ultra-modern specs the
phablet category now includes handhelds
for a brand new type of buyer the one
who wants a huge screen but doesn't need
a crazy feature set whether this new
subtype ultimately succeeds or
evaporates as anyone's guess but it's a
market Samsung has put a stake in with
its Galaxy mega 6.3 and one which HTC
now looks to join with the brand-new One
Maxx how does the One Maxx fare in this
unproven new category let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is our video review of the HTC
One Maxx if you're looking for direct
comparisons of the One Maxx to the
competition stay tuned to pocket now
this week for our usual round of
head-to-head videos and be sure to
follow pocket now at all the usual
social media haunts and subscribe here
on YouTube so you don't miss them to
kick off this review let's jump right
into the most obvious and in-your-face
of this devices assets the hardware it's
impossible to overstate how large this
device really is it's bigger than the
massive galaxy note 3 and oversized LG
g2 and it positively Dwarfs more
conventionally sized smartphones like
the HTC One to say nothing of even
smaller phones like the iPhone and the
Moto X the Maxx is profoundly
ridiculously huge the kind of huge that
requires two hands the kind of huge that
will have everyone asking about the
phone when you bring it out in public
and at 217 grams it's also one of the
heaviest handhelds on the market that's
due in part to its aluminum construction
it which looks about as premium here as
it does on the one aesthetically though
the Maxx more closely resembles the one
Mini without the edge to edge metal and
chamfered edges that gave the flagship
phone much of its appeal now part of
that sacrifice is justified the redesign
allows for a removable back cover under
which sits a micro SD card slot an
overdue addition for those who
crave expandable storage the battery is
still embedded but it's also oversized
at 3300 milliamp hours and between it
and the camera lens sits HTC's new
fingerprint sensor which we'll talk more
about in a minute on the flip side sits
the max's gigantic 5.9 inch 1080p
display which uses the same SL cd3
technology found in the one and creates
a picture that's just as beautiful these
benefits do a lot to offset the Max's
few aesthetic compromises and while we'd
still like to have seen less of the
minis design influence this is still the
most premium feeling phablet out there
we just wish it was lighter and narrower
because using it one-handed is a near
impossibility the one max is also going
to take some grief from spec fanatics
due to its internals the Snapdragon 600
powering the phone isn't a low-end
system by any means but those expecting
the higher power Snapdragon 800 or a
larger helping of RAM on this massive
device will come away disappointed
fortunately on a well-made device specs
don't have as much to do with
performance as you might think and
insofar as software goes the max is a
well-made device HTC has bumped the OS
version to Android 4.3 here and overlaid
it with a new version of its third-party
UI since 5.5 now in terms of performance
the enhancements here are limited sense
5 was as smooth an android skin as we'd
ever seen with little room for
improvement so HTC has brought upgraded
features instead enhancing its blinkfeed
social browser with Instagram and
Google+ functionality along with RSS
support and tighter smarter integration
with Facebook as well as the ability to
remove blinkfeed from the home screen if
you so choose
HTC's gallery has also been given an
overhaul making an excellent but
convoluted feature of the one somewhat
less convoluted on the max it still
takes a while to learn how to properly
build a highlight reel from photos
videos and zoe's but the end result is
more fun because the user has more
control than ever before there's even
the capacity to create animated gifs
it's not as simple as it could be but
the new version of the gallery is a rich
full experience that outclasses
everything else out there and it looks
incredible on the max's giant screen the
picture isn't so rosy in terms of
security the fingerprint scanner and the
one max is nothing like the one found on
the iphone 5s which performs very well
and results in a positive ID nearly
every time on our review iphone the
max's scanner requires a more precise
swipe gesture that's nowhere near as
reliable in the scanning windows
position beneath the camera ensures
you'll be constantly smudging your lens
that also makes unlocking the phone
while it's sitting on a table tricky yes
you can opt to enter your password
instead but that's as cumbersome as
another max feature using different
fingers to unlock directly into an app
in fact cumbersome is a good way to
describe the entire experience of using
a finger to unlock such a massive phone
as this we're really not sure why it's
here and its implementation is weak
enough that we sort of wish it wasn't
thankfully you don't have to use it
sadly HTC has also made no effort to
include multitasking enhancements to
take advantage of the larger screen the
recent apps view has been given larger
tiles which makes it easier to eyeball
information within them but there's none
of the side-by-side multi window
functionality of samsung phones nor even
the less functional windowed approach
found on LG devices and while the
scribble note-taking app is actually
more polished and attractive than many
of samsung's titles there's no
integrated stylus on the macs meaning
you're forced to doodle with your finger
which is as unfulfilled here as it is on
any other capacitive screen so in terms
of software the one max really is just a
super-sized HTC one and despite our
genuine appreciation for that phone
that's disappointing
especially considering many of these
enhancements will make it to the one
eventually via a software update
one of the things we enjoyed on the one
was its camera well it's four megapixel
sensor may have produced somewhat noisy
relatively low res photos it earned
major points for including optical image
stabilization with the one max we
thought we might see a higher resolution
version of the ultra pixel camera but
instead we got the same four megapixel
shooter with the optical image
stabilization removed that might sound
like a deal-breaker and listen it is a
genuine disappointment but it's not as
bad as it seems
HTC has worked a bit of magic in the new
phone's low-light performance making the
max capable of delivering fairly
respectable night shots despite the lack
of OIS on average they're still not as
sharp as the ones but they did surpass
our expectations photos taken in normal
lighting we're also fairly good though
it was difficult to keep the massive one
max steady in the hand while shooting so
expect some blurry photos HTC is also
included it's fun filters for on-the-fly
jazzing up of pictures and dual capture
is also here for all ten of you who were
asking for it video performance is quite
good with rich color and sharp focus but
only average exposure correction and
sound capture especially in loud
environments 60fps recording is possible
resulting in smooth slow mo and played
back at 30fps and HDR is here as well
for those seeking more balanced videos
overall the camera is passable but not
as good as it could or should be
elsewhere
HTC's feature pruning has struck at the
Max's acoustics as well there's no Beats
Audio branding on the max and no beats
software within the phone but to be
honest we don't really miss it
boom sound is still here in all its
front-facing glory and though the
speakers are the same components used on
the one there increased casing size
means the max generates sound that's
much much louder the original one set
the bar for the new generation of
smartphone acoustics and the max leaps
right over it
that performance shines equally well in
terms of voice quality during our seven
days of testing between London New York
and Boston the max delivered rich clear
sound on both ends of the conversation
with excellent noise cancellation and no
matter how hard we tried we couldn't
trip up the max with even the most
demanding games or heavy websites those
concerned about the lack of a Snapdragon
800 should rest easy because unless you
really need that top-tier SOC this phone
will handle your every need and thanks
to its altered construction it won't get
as hot in the hand as its predecessors
which is nice we'll have more in-depth
impressions on battery life in our full
review ad pocket now but the 3300
milliamp hour power pack got us through
more than a full day of use on HSPA
networks at home and abroad and we're
talking heavy use ultimately the HTC One
Maxx is something between a super-sized
HTC One and an ultra sized One mini but
we can't help but wonder who was asking
for that if you're one of the few people
who looked at the original one and said
this needs to be bigger
well the max will suit you fine but for
the vast majority of folks this phone is
likely to come across as just too big
and too heavy to justify its marginal
improvements especially considering the
compromise as it makes along the way so
while we give the One Maxx the same
score as the Samsung Galaxy mega we're
still left wondering just who exactly
this phone is for
is it for you yes no let us know down in
the comments below and toss us a like if
you did enjoy this video review the full
written review of the HTC One Maxx will
be available at pocketnow.com very
shortly we'll drop a link down in the
description when that goes live and we
will also have a full set of comparison
videos published here on YouTube just as
soon as we can film them until next time
