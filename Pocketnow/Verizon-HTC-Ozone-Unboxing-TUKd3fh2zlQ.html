pocketnow.com and today just received
one of the latest phones that Verizon
Wireless is selling so let's go ahead
and open it up the big box or what I'm
sure is a little box inside we can't
pull that out of the way and what do we
have here we've got the verizon wireless
HTC ozone which is what's being marketed
as a global smartphone it's a variant of
the HTC snap but it has cdma ev-do as
well as gsm support and this is what
makes it a global smartphone so let's go
hook and crack up this box it's these
boxes seem all similar this is the
verizon format now and take the phone
now this is a demo version from verizon
so it looks like its previously been
used put that aside see what kind of
accessories we have with this unit we've
got the dreaded dongle for the
headphones soon to be remedied by HTC it
looks like we've got your this is a
global phone european plug AC plug looks
like we've got a british UK plug and I
think we have a plug from Down Under
yeah I believe that's what that is and
the familiar a familiar American plug
here
on this side we've got the USB cable and
the power supply the power supply which
obviously you put the type of plug you
one on the front so for the US flag we
should be able just slide this in and
then use the USB cable and this is
essentially just a USB charger plug
directly into the unit then we've got
our manuals here this is the overall
Quick Start Guide looks fairly detailed
steps to take to get your smartphone
going we've got the companion CD we've
got the verizon access manager to allow
you to set tether the the phone to a
laptop and various tips and instructions
and so on that verizon provides you so
you basically have your basic setup with
the phone so let's take a look at the
phone see I guess the battery was
already inserted this is a 1500 milliamp
battery what I was most interested in
seeing was the sim card and it looks
like a verizon vodafone sim card yeah so
it's all set to go to access the global
gsm network and then maybe we'll try
with an AT&amp;amp;T card just to see what
happens this phone is actually quite a
deal currently at 49 99 with a two-year
contract so anyway I will get this phone
charged up and we'll see what it can do
I'll be back with the hardware tour
shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
