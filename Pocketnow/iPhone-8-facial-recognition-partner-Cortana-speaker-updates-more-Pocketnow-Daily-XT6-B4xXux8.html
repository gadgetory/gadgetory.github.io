supplier for the next generation iPhone
Microsoft has already begun in listing
more OEMs for the Cortana speakers and
we'll hear some new enhancements that
will come soon to the next generation
Apple watch
I'm high metally then I and even though
it's not Friday it's only fair free to
celebrate early if you have to this is
talking out daily the official news
today begin with deals from a company
that is rare for them Fitbit is not
having a great time in its quarter
results up to the point where we finally
see up to $40 off and a ton of fitbit's
on Amazon but the deal is actually for a
little time like in the description I'll
talk about LG and Netflix says that
Netflix has just rolled out HDR content
that's now compatible with Dolby vision
and hdr+ or HDR 10 I think it was for
the case of the LG G 6 and the reason
why this is important is because even
though you do get this so long as you
have an LG G 6 the parlance it doesn't
work on every plan you actually have to
get the four screen package from Netflix
that will cost you like 12 dollars and
even though devices like the iPhone 7 in
addition to the Samsung Galaxy s8 are
compatible with the wider color gamut
you'll have to wait for those for some
reason I'll probably Microsoft those of
you that thought that Harman was the
only company that was going to build
smart speakers that is not going to be
the case
Microsoft has just proved them that just
like it did with the piece sealed it
with speakers now in the case of having
HP and Intel sign contracts which will
enable both companies to collaborate in
the future and bring Cortana speakers
it's just hard to tell exactly when that
will happen but we can't wait for about
Apple the Apple watch series to in my
opinion is probably one of the most
complete smartwatches out there I hated
Series 1 but there is one particular
thing that watch doesn't do in that
sleep tracking sure you can use
third-party applications but the watch
natively does not sleep track and now
that Apple has acquired bedded which is
a company that design accessories for
people to track their sleep all points
to one of the next features of the Apple
watch to be to be able to track your
sleep can't wait to see how that's going
to work
just hope it doesn't require more
hardware as devices like Samsung gear
said - and the gear s3 could traffic
just fine and clarity is very hot
because they have to do with the next
generation iPhone and LG both companies
have collaborated for years when it
comes to IPS displays the peel LEDs on
the Apple watch but it seems that now
it's going to go further LG is actually
investing in a new factory at facility
just to build the facial recognition
modules for the next generation iPhone
and for those of you that thought of the
Galaxy s8 does good facial recognition
it does but you can actually fake it
really easily with a photo for example
and one of the things that apparently
this iPhone will fix is that ability to
not fake facial recognition through a
photo whatever the case may be time will
tell but it leads me to the question of
the day do you think that Apple will
figure this out just like the company
has figured out a ton of things over
time or do you still feel that facial
recognition is a gimmick in my case I
love our scanning I will admit it but
