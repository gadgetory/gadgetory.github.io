usual with the reviews of certain
products given the holiday season but
there are certain feel that just cannot
go and notice for a proper treatment I'm
hanging out any better with pocket now
when this is our review of the lii Kohli
Pro 3 the Eco has done an amazing job
lately with a smartphone offerings but
one of the main reasons we decided to
review the lis pro 3 even weeks after
its release is because of our different
this phone is to your standard Android
phone Sealy eco is better remembered as
lis TV more of a content consumption
company in China so think of this phone
more geared towards that approach when
it comes to its visuals it does look
like your typical Android phone we've
got to brush the aluminum finish at the
backside while spinning at a distance is
quite prone to smudges when seen closely
internally it also resembles your
typical Android device we've got the
usual specifications like a Snapdragon
801 processor 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs
of non-expandable storage the device is
different in a few other areas number of
content consumption is the focus here so
the bezels on the 5.5 inch 1080p LCD
don't seem to exist though they're
actually there it's actually just a
paint trick but the cool thing is that
they do lead to an immersive experience
when consuming content mainly because of
this and the fact that the dual speakers
provided do an amazing job though these
come from the earpiece and the bottom
firing speaker there's also an insanely
large battery at 40 70 million powers
how can you consume up to five and a
half hours of screen on time and yes
what you see there is an IR blaster
believe it or not even in 2016 we
finally get another phone with this and
man really if it wasn't for the lack of
a headphone jack this would be the
perfect content consumption phone at
least for many of us
the problem is when you start using the
device EUI is not my favorite cup of tea
mainly because of how it moves away from
how a standard android phone works and
it's actually very confusing for
starters slide down from the top and
you'll get notifications and if you want
to look for settings note they're
actually not here these are in the
recent apps button along with quick
settings and controls you guess that
there is no app tray as well and the
button in the middle is actually leading
to the company's Lee Life services the
Lee life services are good considering
if you want to consume content the
problem is some of these are repetitive
mainly most of us will just go to the
YouTube application to consume our
videos and then the other live services
are from channels that are really not
common in our areas or at least from my
experience testing apps I will commend
Lee ego for how snappy the user
interfaces but there was really no need
to reinvent the wheel here when you
consider the camera you're talking about
a 16 megapixel primary shooter with f/2
aperture and 8 megapixels in the selfie
shooter photos during the day are
actually very good I would even say that
the screen doesn't do enough justice to
the saturation of these photos once you
pull them out
obviously at night is when you really
test things and the lack of optical
image stabilization makes this film
humble and being able to capture steady
shot and that lack of stability is very
notorious on video we're walking around
is definitely not going to look good
something that's rather said given how
many phones out there don't have optical
image stabilization and still perform
admirably now to conclude let's be fair
if you consider the price tag of this
device you're talking about a very
compelling product we're talking about
top tier specifications and design for
just 399 and if you're lucky you can
find this phone for $2.99 at Lee mall
this is definitely a great way to make
this phone turn heads considering the
Lee pro 3 is a good device the only
problem is once you match it in both
price tag and specifications to devices
like the 1 + 3 P where you'll get better
specifications similar if great looks
and
build and more important a cooler
probably one of our favorite Android
skins as I listened to the convoluted
approach the software in the lack of
features the lis pro three would be a
great phone and obviously if you find
this phone for $2.99 then Hank go for it
so this is not me saying that the lis
pro 3 is a bad phone it's actually a
very good phone again I just feel that a
lot of things then need to be reinvented
