the air and you're right it's also the
ipad 3 event that's always scheduled so
let's talk about
hello everyone this is hi Mary better
with pocketnow.com and let's talk about
the top five killer features that we
expect the ipad 3 or whatever it's going
to be called to get the top five killer
feature pretty much has to do with
things that won't really change which is
not really a feature but still things
that are actually good first of all
Apple will most likely keep the same
iPad to design which is really good it's
kind of tough for all competitors to
figure out it can be with that so that's
probably not going to change another
thing is most probably they won't change
the storage I'm really fond as a 16
gigabyte storage model but with all the
problems out there with storage
companies having problems keeping the
same prices most likely Apple will stick
with the same business model another
thing that most probably won't change is
the battery life hopefully the same 10
hours unless we get more and then again
the other thing we don't expect to
change is the price Apple change the
price between the iphone first
generation and the iphone 3g
dramatically for reasons we don't
understand but we don't see that same
thing happening with the ipad and the
ipad 2 unless Apple comes with the same
design and they feel that they need to
drop the price in order to compete which
is not really the case right now Apple
will most likely keep the price not sure
we're going to keep the same models
considering 4G 3G or Wi-Fi but most
likely Apple will figure out a way to
provide some sort of enhancements for
the same price the number four killer
feature that we're expecting has to do
with the a6 quad-core processor and
everything that surrounds it see it's
not only quad core enhanced graphics and
speed and just about everything but
apples going into the 1080p number
market they're currently stuck at 720p
em they've been stuck there for a while
so most likely the itunes store will now
support 1080p for movies videos and
everything and also we will get 1080p
video recording on the ipad 3 and also
1080p video reproduction on the ipad 3
and probably even a new Apple TV some
people are speculating out there they
will probably get an Apple TV you know a
real TV I'm pretty sure that's going to
happen the apple TV is currently stuck
at the 8th floor processor and it's
currently not being found that Apple
stores or a retailer so most probably
Apple is pulling that back shipping it
in with the new a6 processor quad-core
processor for the Apple TV so 1080p is
going to be that number probably we are
going to get
better cameras on the ipad 3 but most
likely that's just going to be to
support 1080p we're not expecting
something better than what we currently
have in cameras because apple doesn't
believe that you should use an ipad as a
camera so again 1080p is the magic
number the quad core processor with the
enhancements you never know what could
happen now the a6 quad-core processor
also gives in to the number three killer
feature that we expect and it's for
apples of finally support LTE
connectivity in the United States and
just about everywhere where it could be
found almost probably see that the ipad
3 will include probably hspa+ for those
countries that don't support it because
the iphone 4s pretty much already has it
and we also can expect LTE connectivity
now not sure how Apple will plan to
bring those LTE speeds and also those
same 10 hours of battery life most
likely that has to do with the fact that
a lot of people are speculating that
Apple will make the ipad 3 a little bit
thicker in order to support that LTE
connectivity probably in the United
States we know that the ipad 2 currently
is a little bit heavier than the Wi-Fi
model and 3g in order for it to provide
that same battery life that it needs for
the 10 hours so probably that's one of
the things that we'll see we'll probably
see a lighter model that will be the
Wi-Fi only version but it'll still be
just this thick in a much heavier model
that provides a much larger brat battery
in order to support LTE so it's probably
going to be the time now rumors have it
that well since sprint doesn't have LTE
most probably it won't be supported timo
is just getting on the wagon not really
sure when so most probably that LT will
only be provided to AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and
then we can expect something like
whatever is provided by sprint in just
about every other carrier let's see what
happens with that now the number two
killer feature is actually kind of weird
because I could probably say right now
iOS 5.1 with a version of Siri but iOS
5.1 has been in beta four months and
Apple hasn't pushed it so most likely a
lot of us are expecting that Apple will
finally bring some sort of a version of
iOS 6 to be launched with the next
generation ipad 3 now I could probably
be wishful thinking because obviously
WWDC is just a couple of months away and
most likely we will get iOS 6 as a
software being announced the WWDC but if
it's not that then why is Apple chosen
to stay
waiting for its iOS 5.1 to be launched
most probably because there aren't
things that should be proud of now
probably there are two things that we
are expecting in this whatever software
released we're going to get number one
is a version of Siri that is available
for the iPad but probably that has some
enhanced features probably we could
expect that Siri works differently on a
tablet that it works on a phone you
can't tell Siri to call someone on
tablets obviously there are things that
won't be supported and you can there are
things that could be supported like for
example text to speech reading of I
books and some sort of enhanced features
apple needs to figure out a way to work
with Amazon and compete with their
kindles so obviously they have to figure
out how to bring some enhanced features
with Siri and another thing that we are
expecting with iOS 6 if it will ever
happen is that Apple will finally
somehow bring some sort of update to the
UI probably you widgets it could
probably be wishful thinking but we are
expecting for Apple to bring some sort
of new enhancements I mean windows 8
customer previews out android ICS is
getting on a lot of tablets and eschews
is figuring out a way to make that work
really well so Apple really needs to
figure out a way to get into the game
and it's not that they're out of the
game but probably they do need some sort
of freshman to the you are it's
currently more than dated so let's see
if that could happen again a better
version of Siri probably enhance for
tablets it could probably be even a
better assistant to help you use the
tablet and better ways probably I don't
know to dictation to you know we're
documents and stuff like that or I don't
know anything for Siri and obviously a
better version of iOS we'll see now
before we get to the top number one
feature we're expecting Apple to provide
with the next generation iPad don't
expect us to add a 7-inch tablet on this
list we actually scratch that because
well the 7-inch tablet market has been
good but it hasn't been great it hasn't
been providing Apple any sort of
significant competition or for them to
even consider bringing a 7-inch tablet
and we've seen that the Kindle Fire has
struggled in providing that great
experience to users in reading books so
Apple you know some people even thought
of a 16 by 9 aspect ratio for the next
generation iPad we're not considering
that because Apple sees their iPad is
more of a reading the device then and
what movie watching device
the 4 by 3 aspect ratio provides an even
better option for that so most likely
it'll remain with the same design
they'll remain with everything and yes
we could probably see a 7-inch tablet in
the future but that won't be the case
now don't think that we don't wish the
Tim Cook comes on stage and proves me
wrong hopefully that'll be the case we'd
love to see a 7-inch tablet from the
ipad but i really see that step that's
going to happen now the number one
killer feature that everybody wants on
their next generation ipad is pleased of
retina display some sort of display
whatever anything that's better than the
current resolution that we have I needed
it's crazy to have the iphone for us in
the iphone 4 with such great resolution
and then go to the ipad and not have
that same experience now a lot of people
have really proven that well if you're
in a desktop monitor you're not getting
the same amount of ppi that you get on
the iphone obviously you hold your phone
closer to your face then you would a
computer and most likely the ipad was
brought to the market with the same
mentality now we're not sure how apple's
going to really do this first of all we
see two challenges with retina display
the first one is the fact that well
1080p is not really the resolution that
will be provided by a double the pixel
retina display that would be required
for retina to 300 and something ppi most
likely Apple will have to figure out a
smart way to scale 1080p movies to work
well on their new generation display and
well second of all we can obviously see
apples struggle with their option on how
applications will scale to the new
generation now obviously the iPad
applications will most likely scale the
way that the iphone 3gs and the iphone 4
F scale at the beginning they were kind
of pixelated but the problem is remember
that you can also run iPhone
applications on your iPad so how will
Apple handle that is the biggest
question that we have now remember that
Apple has been pushing developers as for
the past couple of months to figure out
how to do it and they actually got a
deadline to move their applications into
the retina business so probably that
could probably being solved with that
reason updating the policy but not
really sure what to make of that now
again the killer feature there we are
expecting as a Retina Display it would
totally defeat the purpose of a new
generation ipad of apple doesn't provide
a better a better user experience for
text
now there have also been rumors of some
more some sort of a text reader the dual
sort of display that could probably come
in the next generation iPad those are
long rumors not sure what to expect but
hopefully that will be the case we will
be getting a better display on the next
generation device that's it for today's
top five thank you very much for
watching if you agree or disagree leave
us a comment down below and well don't
forget to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
