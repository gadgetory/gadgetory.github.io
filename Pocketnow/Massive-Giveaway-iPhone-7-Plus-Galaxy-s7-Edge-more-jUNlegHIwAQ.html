and social media were one portals like
Twitter gave us all a voice in a medium
to express our thoughts and for a while
that was great sadly today there is such
a thing as social media etiquette where
some have chosen to add a filter to
these thoughts based on concerns of what
others will think or to avoid the drama
of hateful comments that precise problem
it's which spun the creation of the new
kid in town I'm hi Natalie that with
pocket now and let's talk about candid
so currently the main reason why social
media took off years ago as its main
deterrent and that's your face on every
post whether it's due to your follower
counter the fact that your family and
friends are following you most people
actually do care about what others will
think so candid really wants to change
that the wake and that is unique is
because you simply create a profile
within the application and even if you
use Facebook to set it up the concept is
that it only tells you how many of your
friends and contacts are within candid
it doesn't really tell you who they are
within the app then you're given the
option to choose specific topics you
want to speak your mind about and yes
some of these are edgy after this all
you have to do is respond to the current
topics that already exist or create your
own kemet creates a weird nickname for
each post and you can simply track these
within your profile but people won't be
able to track you because this nickname
is different for every different topic
you talk about basically this is like a
form with the advantage and disadvantage
that people can't really track who you
are and I say disadvantage because you
really can't track who they are either
it's candid right for you well that's a
tough question that i have a few answers
for i'll give you an example i
specifically avoid talking about
politics and social media to avoid the
backfire but that doesn't mean i don't
have an opinion on it and that's where
it can it really comes in handy
sometimes people want to vent about
their personal thoughts or love problems
or whatever so yes there is a market of
people out there that really want to
just vent and candid is pretty much
perfect for that
now let's cut to the chase can it
believe so much in their product that
they're willing to bet money on it
they've partnered with us to give away
five of the hottest smartphones of the
year I'm talking about the iphone 7 plus
a samsung galaxy s7 edge a 1 plus 3 a
ZTE exon 7 and a huawei honor 8 each of

recommended in our reviews and really to
participate all you have to do is
