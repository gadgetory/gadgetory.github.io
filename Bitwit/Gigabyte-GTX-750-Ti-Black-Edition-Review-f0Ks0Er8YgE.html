a review of the gigabytes gtx 750ti
black edition in case you're wondering
what makes it a black edition card
besides the obvious color scheme these
particular models have undergone
gigabytes extended 7-day durability
tests meaning they've each sustained 168
continuous hours of server level testing
in gigabytes taiwan-based facilities so
apparently the color black is synonymous
with prolonged strain and labor kind of
sounds like a race thing is this a race
thing I think the important thing to
take away here folks is that you're less
likely to receive this card to do a
inside the boxes the video card itself a
molex to 6-pin PCI II adapter Quick
Start Guide and a diploma of sorts
confirming your card has graduated from
gigabyte university after passing its
seven-day final exam you also get a
driver installation disk with gigabytes
OC go to software for tweaking and
tuning the card's parameters now if
you'll excuse me I'm just gonna vomit
some specs really quick the card is PCIe
gen3 and features the GM 107 GPU from
nvidia it comes factory overclocked with
a base clock of 1163 megahertz and a
boost of 1240 - a nice bump over the
stock gtx 750ti at 10 20 megahertz base
and 1080 boost two gigs of gddr5 memory
coffee at 5400 mega Hertz on a 128-bit
bus make this card ideal for light to
moderate 1080 gaming on a single display
it also has 640 cuda cores and supports
DirectX 11.2 and OpenGL 4.2 like the non
black Edition the card can output 4k at
60 Hertz using two HDMI cables which is
nice for media playback but trying to
gain with this card at that resolution
will make you want to scream and vomit
the card supports up to 4 monitors three
of which can be used simultaneously for
gaming with the fourth acting as a
companion display and as with any 700
series card you can take advantage of in
videos exclusive technology like game
stream and gsync provided you have a
g-sync monitor and Nvidia shield but
before you get to it make sure you have
at least a 400 watt power supply to
prevent the Black Edition implements a 2
slot design and features gigabytes
reputable win for cooler the open air
shroud is fully metal and exceptionally
sturdy making it one of the most durable
cards in its class you might even go so
far as to say it's ultra durable the 280
millimeter fans are pleasantly quiet
under load and sit above an aluminum
heatsink permeated by a single 8
millimeter copper heat pipe it would
have been nice to see the heat pipe in
black or even silver but whatever it's a
heat pipe now
reference gtx 750ti wasn't tailored for
raw power but for power efficiency
hence the absence of SLI support and a
single 6-pin pci ii connector sipping
the power baby on the top is a nicely
painted black PCB which is a huge
aesthetic improvement in my opinion over
the off-putting blue PCB on the non
black edition video outputs on the back
include two HDMI ports and two dual link
DVI ports the top one being digital and
the bottom analog now I'm pretty much
sold on the black edition at this point
but this wouldn't be a legit video card
review without some benchmarks so I
popped it in the old test bed and was
pleasantly surprised to see the boos
clock hitting just over 1300 megahertz
in all my stock frequency tests if that
wasn't generous enough the card even had
a good amount of overclocking Headroom
allowing me to add 100 mega Hertz to the
core frequency and 300 to the memory
clock this provided a smooth experience
and all the games I tested except for
Battlefield 4 where the framerate
frequently dipped into the low 20s
bear in mind however this was run on
ultra knock it down to medium settings
and you're good to go
overall the gigabyte gtx 750ti Black
Edition gets many things right
acoustics build quality and outstanding
price to performance make this card a
compelling offer for gamers on a budget
or if you're just looking for a casual
yet comfortable gaming experience thank
