to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or the next Windows 10
update will simply be Vista we're at
Coolermaster now and of course just like
all my other CES 2017 coverage Paul must
be included at some point so there's
Paul but look at all this stuff they
have on the wall this is further
mastercase series their whole lineup
there's just a ton of options here that
you can trick out your system with just
to expand the functionality wherever you
need it I'm not gonna go through
everything here because it would take a
while but you can kind of read the signs
there they've got a bunch of interesting
things one cool addition is the vertical
SS I'm sorry the vertical GPU adapter
that is now is now included and also
these illuminated LED partition panels
um that would actually go the lower
compartment of your case to divide it up
a little bit in much much much bling so
to speak we've also got a new case over
here this is the mastercase pro 6 and
it's got a really cool aesthetic
actually on the outside and the thing
about this chassis is that it's
supposedly tailored for silence you can
see here there are these kind of like
floating panels that are adjustable you
can actually put them down if you push
them down just like that
you can tailor it for extreme silence
just for the utmost silent acoustic
profile and you can easily pop them back
up just based on your needs if you want
to open up a little bit more airflow
looks like you've got plenty of radiator
support there at the front as well as
the top I believe as well yeah okay so
he got radiator radiator options up the
wazoo
look at that this is a perfect example
of that vertical GPU orientation if you
want to show if your graphics card I'm
just a very beautiful elegant design of
course we've got the tempered glass I
really do like that there's a lock on
there you take this to Al and part of
your some you know anyone steel in your
rig or stealing your components inside
very nice and you said this is q2 or
weight when is this getting released q2
or q3 so be sure to look out for that
and the price point was anywhere from
we're still iffy on that so stay tuned
for all of that now you have the cool
thing that I want to show you guys here
at the booth is is this this is actually
we Paul and I walked in here in a rush
and we're like alright show us
like the coolest thing that you have
here and they brought us here to a power
supply I wasn't expecting a power supply
to be one of the cool that one of the
things that the Coolermaster team was
the most excited about here but it's
actually pretty interesting this is a
1200 watt units is they're calling it
the master watch maker 1200 watt mi j mi
J stands for made in Japan as the sign
suggests right there and this is
something that they've been in
development with for like three years
the past three years they've been
working on this and if you just take a
look here it's like just ridiculous over
the top internals there's certain
component tree in here that regular
made-in-china units do not even contain
that just to clean up the power and just
improve the efficiency in fact the
efficiency is so good it actually goes
beyond titanium 80 plus certification so
we're going to think of a new standard
for that I think I overheard Dimond at
one point maybe we can go with like yeah
double black diamonds you know uh-huh
this ain't no bunny slope so this is a
really really fascinating product so of
course it is gonna set you back about
$1,000
I think maybe maybe you're gonna have to
get a really expensive case to even be
worthy of putting it in there but this
was also in collaboration with a very
reputable company in Japan
Murata I don't know if I'm pronouncing
that right but there's there's a is that
is a poner right there
Kenzo he's believe he's the lead
engineer this guy soldered every single
thing by heat on every unit now I'm just
totally joking he did not do that but it
comes in two very nice packaging as well
fully modular system it's got a nice a
nice nice fan right there it is a very
heavy unit which obviously is a good
sign that there are some quality
components in this thing so be sure to
stay tuned for that as well alright guys
that's gonna wrap it up for my coverage
of the cooler master suite here at CES
2017 huge thank you to my sponsors MSI
fractal design and of course cable mod
go ahead and check out their stuff in
the comments know in the description
below and hopefully you guys join me for
more CES coverage coming at you really
soon have a good one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
