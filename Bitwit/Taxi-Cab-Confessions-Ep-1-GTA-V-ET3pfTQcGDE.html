fine way do you mean a dead body in real
life well I mean I'm in the military so
I'm not really you know so what what
branch of the military would usually say
Air Force oh nice I should clarify i

sent to me because one of my friends
unfortunately uh that over there how
close were you to your friend who passed
away we went to basic training together
so we we kind of had that bond yeah for
sure do you do you know how he how he
went um well you know IED the common
thing that happens over there man so you
weren't around when when it happened no
I was not I was in Japan when it
happened to my friend Jesus how how old
was he he was 19 Wow
Wow
found out a really shitty way to I mean
I was I was just eating breakfast in the
dining facility and every day or every i
want to say every week they run a list
of everyone that's unfortunately lost
their life and my friend was on that
list i was like go away it's got to be
another guy with the same name and then
nope wasn't Wow it was like two years
ago so I've I've come to terms with it
it happens unfortunately yeah that's
anyway we're playing grand theft auto
let's have fun you know yes fictional
world absolutely I'm being shot by
somebody don't shoot me
how are you doing this evening okay that
just came in me yeah not too bad nice
I'm this in a really failed heist job
saw house so you seem like a younger
limber fellow I gotta ask you just just
out of curiosity is all anonymous and
stuff how about how many how many times
like like how often do you fap like how
many times a week I'd be honest there
are you ask this is the opentable now
I'm asking you I'm just curious what is
a lot like watching once a week no
different then that all depends on the
week really do you usually find like you
fat more when you've had a hard week or
is it just more of like a blob solutely
yeah I wakeboard oh yeah definitely i'm
actually entertained doing shit i I
don't think oh hey let's look at some
porn right exactly it's always kind of
like well there's nothing left to do
type of thing where are you tonight that
proves that work are you have to go to
bed yeah that's a good way to go to bed
alright so so just switching gears here
what's what's what's the biggest crime
you've ever committed just curious if
you've committed a crime of course but
you know I feel like everyone's
committed a crime at some point whether
it's you know speeding or running a red
light or something like that but you'd
be surprised employed yes I kind of
question I asked my friend what was the
craziest thing you've ever done he goes
I raped the girl yeah well I mean
denotes a fuck a cold cold cold fuckin
and that's that's hair look you should
never rape someone if you have you know
the option of course you would have
saturated so is it that's actually a lot
more common than people want to actually
believe I know I know that's why I'm
always so fascinated when I hear like
everyone thinks rapist like some
back-alley thing so hopefully neither of
you guys have ever raped someone but if
there's is there anything else that
no you'd like to get off your chest til
it drugs at a club once public cuz i
bought it and I thought fuck where they
don't want to actually do this so that i
sold it back to some other guy nice what
what kind of drugs about it i was
ecstasy south ok why didn't you uh why
didn't you go through with doing it oh
fuck cuz i don't matter i didn't want to
do it like like I do it I just didn't
want to do it that night except to just
change then I was just like nah I don't
want a fuck party yeah just weren't
feeling it right what's up I was just
asking him like you know just following
up on like he's asking us to reveal our
dirty dark secret so that he can publish
it in a book ga he's the fashions I I
wish I could do that I'm a terrible
writer so probably wouldn't do a book
maybe maybe a YouTube video or something
so what about you gay what's your story
same old same old any hopes dreams
exactly
you ever been in love dude I'm fucking
40 yes what was her name Rebecca Rebecca
how old were you when you need the
funding Rebecca the funding on that
aspect is uh we broke up me shit seven
years ago I'm now getting a 25 year old
oh they're eight interesting things
going on there you go you know there's a
there's always new things to discover
with each relationship closed again fat
boy it was Rebecca like was she kind of
like the one that got away or did she
need to go all god I know I I assisted I
can hire somebody and get away with it
the killer I would oh yeah yeah we've
got a kid together in the middle of a
custody battle Oh brutal
yeah but it's a tough situation but you
can kind of stew bad you can't just like
keep the kid and ditch the baggage in a
perfect world is she is she like unfit
to to raise the kid or is she just you
know you just prefer to be with him I
wouldn't say that but some of the stuff
her husband who she married six months
after we split up yeah there's a whole
lot of situation there Wow why did you
guys split up um cuz I found her fucking
somebody else oh shit and I'm guessing
this is probably after you guys had the
kid yep Jesus I take it the guy she was
fucking isn't the guy that she married
yep oh it is okay who's a sensitive for
me I'm no longer able to talk to my son
which is just so kind of long but at the
same time just provides me more ammo you
know through my lawyer so when we shit
let's let's fucking fubar man yeah
life is what it is well for what it's
worth man I know we're just two
strangers in a big city called Los
Santos but I hope via the whole custody
thing each kid works out for you hey you
