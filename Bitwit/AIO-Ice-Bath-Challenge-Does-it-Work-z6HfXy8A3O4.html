get yours today on the awesomesauce tool
who those guys welcome back to the
channel today I've got something a
little experimental plan for y'all that
actually comes as an idea from a
follower of mine Keith thank you so much
Keith for sending me this idea when I
read it I knew instantly that I had to
try it I actually haven't seen this done
anywhere in the tech tuber space I'm
sure someone out there has done it and
published it on the interwebs but I
personally haven't seen it so I thought
it was a cool idea
plus I'm very curious myself to see how
this all works out basically what we're
going to be doing today is we're going
to be taking a reading of an AI Oh like
this Corsair H 100 IG TX taking the fans
off and submerging it into a bucket of
ice water as you can see this this is a
cereal container that's empty right now
but I'm going to be going to the store
in a bit picking up some ice dump it and
dumping it in here and then running some
tests on my test bed here 5820k
overclocked at 40 300 megahertz 32 gigs
of g.skill ram x99 gaming G 1 G 1 Wi-Fi
from gigabyte as well as an R 9 285 from
sapphire not going to be focusing too
much on this card it's really just here
so we can run our tests but I'm going to
be running all these tests mainly GTA 5
as well as asus real bench so I've got
some real-world and synthetic
performance tests thrown in there and
then we're just going to compare and
contrast the temperatures that we get
from a standard a IO with the two 120
millimeter fans compared to ice ice
machine mayhem obviously this is a very
impractical situation or method of
cooling I should say I wouldn't
recommend anyone doing it unless you're
just doing it for the walls or for
science but on that note ladies and
gentleman there's not really much else
to this video other than just kind of
the curious the curiosity factor that's
thrown in here but I think on that note
I'm going to run to the store really
quick pick up some ice so we can start
testing although first I should probably
put some pants on just goes
you
you can get your ice pretty much at any
local grocery store I prefer Vons they
have a wide variety of different ice
types anything from a rock-hard ice to
room-temperature ice also known as water
alright
ice has been acquired I got the Refresh
brand let me know if you'd like me to
review this bag of ice in a future video
all right so we are back at home base
now and as you can see I have promptly
filled up our cereal container full of
ice water
we've been running under load for about
half an hour now doing various testing
so you can see the ice is starting to
melt but rest assured the water is still
freezing as hell we also did manage to
get the entire radiator submerged I'd
say 98% submerged as far as the the fin
stack there's a little bit of the the
fin array sticking out but for the most
part we got full coverage there now I
have already run the full gamut of
testing for this video but here's just a
glimpse at the idling temps I guess I'm
not fully at idle because I have some
programs open for the purpose of the
video but I was seeing as low as 8
degrees at one point now that I have a
few things open it's it's we're still
doing pretty well in like the low the
low teens to the mid 20s overall pretty
decent temps there as compared to the
regular AIO when there's no ice involved
is usually in the mid-30s but really we
saw a big big change moving over to low
temperatures especially in prime95 right
here we got all the way up to 72 degrees
Celsius on ice I'm not used to saying
that yeah I'm cooling on ice now when I
did this same test with the regular AIO
with no ice I was actually spiking up to
94 degrees Celsius after about 10
minutes and I had to stop the test
because I was afraid of overheating so
this was really nice I went I was able
to go 15 20 minutes plus with only
capping out at 72 degrees so I was
pretty happy about that
moving on to Asus reel bench really
great synthetic test it's very realistic
we were getting about 84 degrees Celsius
at the very max with our liquid IO and
then moving on to our ice liquid io we
dropped all the way to 60 degrees and
that was the hottest core there you can
see most of the other cores are in the
low to mid 50s range which is actually
pretty good so overall this was a 24
degree Celsius difference going from
regular a IO to ice which is pretty
impressive
even more impressive was the gaming
results for a real world performance I
played a substantial amount of GTA 5 and
maxed out at about 63 degrees Celsius
with the wave with the regular a IO and
then moving over to
ooh ice cooling we got all the way down
to 35 so that was a 28 degrees Celsius
difference which again super impressive
there now a quick disclaimer I do want
you all to bear in mind that cooler CPU
temps does not necessarily translate to
higher overclocks or anything like that
most of the time you're going to be
limited by the silicon in the CPU itself
but what really chilly temps can do for
your system is to prevent any kind of
throttling that may result from
overheating if you plan on aggressively
overclocking your CPU you don't want
your CPU to throttle and get slumped
down to lower clock speeds then you
might need a more substantial system for
cooling but for the most part this was
just more again an experiments not very
practical I mean I don't know maybe
maybe some one of you guys will start
doing this like 24/7 just keep
replenishing ice into the cereal bucket
but for the most part really cool idea
thanks again Keith for it and thank you
guys for watching be sure to stay tuned
for more tech videos come really soon
feel free to hit that like button if you
enjoy weird kind of experimental videos
like this and I might find another one
to do in the future sometime but for the
most part thank y'all for tuning in and
I will see you guys in the next video
you
these tubes these tubes are really cold
I might even say they're ice cold I
think we're gonna start benchmarking now
I should play some music while I do it
I was thinking vanilla ice oh no no no
no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
