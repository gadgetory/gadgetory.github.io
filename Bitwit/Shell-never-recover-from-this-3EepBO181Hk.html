prefer brower's she's a vegetarian
long story doesn't matter drink tickets
acquired
you're the man are you gonna do a cow
hey Kyle this is what I call a
first-person shooter

on you oh my god oh my god the man's
gonna win the bans totally get in with
van and Chuck are gonna win I should put
money on the band right we're gambling
on horses put lots of money on some in
awesome horse your wife
talk to my wife oh my god that's like
the worst nightmare ever we're getting
we're betting on horses we're betting on
horses we're gonna win a lot of money
for betting on horses the really fast
horses you cool that gives me a kiss me
no kiss me
it's all untrue something here a
spaceman it looks like a robotic helmet
holy I should look at the ground more up
start looking down your
where are we going right now what
restaurant are we going there a piace
eat Nazi Mickey is an Italian or the
piace yes alright so it is about two
days after the Oktoberfest festivities
took place we're all fully recovered and
we're mostly me it's Monday morning
everyone's going to work we are going to
the optometrist though her white pea
sauce it's actually her first time going
and the eye doctor in what and since I
was a kid maybe 15 plus years probably
she probably needs new eyes but she
really does also wants a eyeglasses for
some odd reason why why do you want
glasses they're cute obviously so let's
let's all you know let's all cross our
fingers and pray to God that Picasso's
terrible I say
I've never seen your eyes that close up
before honey you got pretty eyes
so blink a little bit if you look
through that mirror you'll see it start
out there you're so close
I'm not giving you any plots that so
what you have something called a state
or the channel so this is perfect fill
material oh yeah big steampunk Harry
Potter
yeah that's how your lives are gonna
look final answer final answer all right
we're back at the office now
wifey sauce is looking stellar in her
fancy new glasses and what are we doing
today boo a box this is not my favorite
one-handed activity Oh a box in a box I
love it when they do that so this bad
boy is gonna go on to this big boy this
is the 43 inch LG IPS display did a
review on recently and I'm gonna try to
get it up on this wall because when I do
build videos from here on out I want it
to be on this nice electric updesk
and yeah there's a really boring white
wall in the background so we're gonna
try to fix that today putting a giant
ass monitor behind me sweet you know we
should really get honey what smaller
level just so cool but it looks even
cooler when I do it no no that's why
that's that starts missing I got to do
the thing at the end
no what do you know you're just jealous
because you can't that was the one
you're so dumb do I sound a stool so you
know I need to be clear that he knows
you don't insult my you're sure woman I
am offended and personally insulted this
is for short people which Kyle is we got
that store for a reason Oh
yeah yeah going deep are you sure that
you hit a stud and not its associ
drywall trust me that was definitely a
stud
takes one to know one after all yeah
zero what come out you can you be
careful with that please all right all
right here we go
I'm mounting in these screws Wow
look you bought that have to eat but
she's serious
yeah it just traveled all the way up to
my pinky Wow all right let's try that
again
yay looks pretty good it's of course not
gonna look super clean once we get it
plugged in because there'll be cables
coming from the bottom or the side or
whatever I don't know if I'm gonna drill
a big-ass hole in the wall and fit all
the cables through I might just get
another white cable channel and just do
it straight down
it'll look clean enough and I'll be
standing in front of it anyway so you
probably won't be able to see much of it
but yeah looks good alright guys well
this seems like a good place to cut off
the vlog so thank you so much for tuning
in we got a lot done this weekend I was
very productive there was also a lot of
unproductive things that happened so
good to maintain a balance I suppose but
thank you so much for tuning in be sure
