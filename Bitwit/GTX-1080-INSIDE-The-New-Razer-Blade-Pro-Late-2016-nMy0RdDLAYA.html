channel so if you caught my recent
Twitter post or my teaser unboxing on
awesome hardware you may have noticed
that I got my hands on the new 2016
razor blade Pro an absolute menace of a
laptop irresponsibly fitted with a quad
core intel core i7 6700 HQ
hyper-threaded skylake processor and a
full GT X 1080 GPU from Nvidia this
thing can easily crush most gaming
desktops out there but as you might
expect cramming all that power and such
a slim package comes at a price with the
specs you see here which includes 32
gigs of DDR 4 and a pair of 256 gig m2
PCIe SSD raid 0 the MSRP of this model
is just a few hundos shy of $4,000 us
and I'll be the first to acknowledge
that much faster desktop PCs can be
built for cheaper this is true but when
you understand the spatial and thermal
challenges of stuffing this and much
more into a slab less than an inch thick
the hefty premium seems a bit more
justified especially when the finished
product performs as well as it does as
we'll see later on the blade pro
measures just 0.9 inches thick and
weighs in at 7.8 pounds which isn't half
bad for a notebook this size the 17.3
inch IGZO touch display sports a 4k
resolution with support for Nvidia
g-sync at 60 Hertz and 100% Adobe RGB
delivering crispy text and vivid imagery
for gamers and content creators alike
too subjective minor gripes here are the
highly reflective gloss screen and the
thick bezels found on other blade
systems the 1920 by 1080 2 megapixel
webcam is a welcome feature for
on-the-go streamers that delivers sharp
images assuming you have ample ambient
lighting Razer also introduces their
ultra low profile mechanical keyboard
with this model the first of its kind
with anti-ghosting capabilities and
individually backlit keys configurable
in their own synapse software while the
keys look great when illuminated
functionally they're not my favorite to
type on the sharp tactile click is on
the stiff side and combining that with
short travel and a 65 gram actuation
force left me with frequently missed
keystrokes on the other hand the way the
keys feel and respond while gaming is
gosh darn sad
trying once I fired up doom for the
first time it was like a light bulb went
off and everything I loathed about the
keys became all the things I loved about
them turns out you just have to be
pumping led into the face of Hell spawn
demons in order to appreciate the stiff
quickness of these switches on a side
note the keys also emit this weird
crispy sizzling sound which will likely
be a lover hate affair now one revision
I hope to find was backlight
illumination for the keys secondary
functions there are plenty of useful
functions assigned to the S key so it's
just a shame that they're secondary
icons still don't light up on the right
side of the device you'll find a handy
volume scroll wheel with lighting strips
dedicated both immediate keys and a
large multi-point touch pad with chroma
trim lighting around the edges the pad
feels smooth but sturdy and tracks quite
well from a functional standpoint I'm
still on the fence about shifting the
touchpad to the right side of the keys
while it does help prevent accidental
cursor movement when typing I do miss
being able to track with my thumb's
without having to lift one of my hands
off the keyboard connectivity options
include an SD card reader Thunderbolt 3
via USB type-c 3 USB 3 ports full size
HDMI 2.0 out a combo 3.5 millimeter jack
rj45 and AC power on the side you'll
also find grills covering the stereo
speakers which sound surprisingly good
for a laptop and there's a Kensington
lock which you should definitely use
because I will try to steal the tribute
powering the unit from the wall is a 250
watt power brick that maintains an
impressive slim profile for easy travel
without the AC adapter battery life
lasted 2 and a half hours with light
tasks and a bit of gaming at 80% screen
brightness it's not the best by any
stretch but considering the display and
hardware we're driving it ain't that bad
either just make sure you don't leave
your brick behind if you plan on gaming
or you'll be Sol speaking of gaming
that's what we're really here to talk
about isn't it and why not this is where
the blade Pro shines best flexing its
hardware muscles in game the CPU turbos
to 3.5 gigahertz while the core clock of
our GT X 1080 hits a max of eighteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz well
above the founders editions rated boost
clock of seventeen hundred and thirty
three megahertz being pressed for time I
only ran too heavy hitting bench
barks but their results give us a
clearer picture of the machines
capabilities in Dumas Ultra settings we
saw 121 FPS on average at 1080p with one
percent lows of 67 and point one percent
lows of 54 scaling up to 4k yielded an
average FPS of 52 with 41 and 39
representing our one percent and point
one percent lows respectively a tight
grouping that hints at visible fluidity
and indeed this was the case favorable
results continued in GTA 5 at 1080p with
an average FPS of 91 a 1% low of 70 and
point 1 percent low of 63 at 4k we turn
out over 60 FPS on average with one
percent lows of 48 and point 1 of 43
resulting in some light choppiness but
an overall enjoyable ride this is a
standout victory as 4k gaming laptops
fitted with Hardware fast enough to push
that many pixels are few and far between
do you think is the cherry on top of all
this with it spare free buttery
smoothness bringing the blade Pro closer
to a premium desktop gaming experience
than any other notebook I personally
tested as you might expect the two
potential trade-offs for such a feat are
acoustics and thermals be warned the
laptop does get loud so you'll want to
plug in your headphones and crank up the
volume to avoid this multi with storm of
fan noise this also means you probably
can't play triple-a games in the
classroom without drawing attention to
the fact that you aren't paying any with
an NBN temperature of 24 degrees C the
GTX 1080 actually stayed cooler than I
anticipated with a max temp of 77 see a
testament to razor's internal fans and
vapor chamber design turns out it was
the CPU that got toasty in our tests
reaching 90 C on the package while this
is still under Intel's critical template
picking up a laptop cooler may not be a
bad idea especially if that leads to a
cooler chassis the aluminum body of the
blade Pro is a wicked heat conductor and
I found the palm rest a bit too warm for
my liking after the half hour mark under
load if this was my personal laptop I
would invest in a slim wrist rest to
shield the heat for lengthy gaming
sessions to sum up the blade pro is a
friggin masterpiece albeit an expensive
one you may think that being able to
tote around a thin slice the 4k gaming
holiness on your back comes with a
laundry list of technical caveats
but the compromises are few and well
worth the payoff
offering a battlefield experience that
isn't just good for a laptop it's
exceptional period if your wallet
supports four-way SLI and you don't mind
the stiffer key switches for typing this
is the ultimate on-the-go battle station
that will satisfy even the highest ranks
of the PC gaming elite but that's gonna
do it for now guys so let me know what
you think of this thing in the comments
below and don't forget to toss me a like
on the video if you enjoyed it you can
also support the channel by checking out
my store and picking up some bonafide
bit with merch as always i'm halibut
