my YouTube gonna say that we are live
now to both platforms mostly uh welcome
everybody this is awesome hardware a
livestream that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware we also stream it to YouTube
if you're watching a slide from there
then you already knew that but we like
to split up into two halves there first
half this week is on my channel
youtube.com slash c / bit wit the old
URL awesomesauce news also work still
phone announce I know that whenever I
whenever I add you is a collaborator in
a video which I do all the time yeah cuz
I'm bro like that I had mostly you do I
always that's how I remember that you
were originally awesomesauce news
because it pops up it's the only way to
do it I don't know how to I know I don't
know if I type in bit with it's a
completely different thing huh I mean
just for that and you know add a
collaborator or you know right now
United or whatever like that is we're
done yeah YouTube needs to update that
it's tired of living in the past
YouTube stopped making me relive it
alright so this is also a fun show where
we talk about tech we drink beer we like
to have some frosty beverages if you
guys are of drinking age feel free to
drink along with us and we also tend to
swear occasionally but only when it's
purposeful and meaningful and
intelligently done every time every time
so you know if you have sense too easy
to just throw out an F right there let's
see we were still selling stuff on our
stores yeah we have things like I have
female shirts now for the Tatas yep they
will fit your your curves your
curvaceous bod just fine
there's also selling it to the ladies so
really selling it white and sauce
already has a couple on the way I think
oh yeah fidget spinners are still in
stock believe it or not we've got hats
regular shirts and glasses and though
it's all good stuff but hoodies to
Paul's got stuff on his website yeah and
so
all right I talked to our John this guy
he does that he does our stores he's
freaking awesome with everything and
just the Ben I talked to him on the
phone yesterday and I realized why don't
people just talk to each other on the
phone anymore yeah awesome and it's
what's way better because it's like
we've have all these emails and like we
had this quick conversation it's all
good
anyway my mugs are on sale we're
clearing these out this last chance to
get into Lebanon smug we're gonna bring
in some some 15 answers so check that
out also doing some pullover hoodies
it's getting towards towards the autumn
now towards the fall winter is coming B
so check out the pullover hoodies and
and see if you're in enjoy those beyond
that all there are some good stuffs
there as well as my glasses and all
those things so my stuff from our stores
it helps support us and allows us to do
more things buy more hardware so that we
can do fun stuff with them on our
channels but for now let's go on to our
first segment let's just dive right in
sink our teeth into this half of the
episode starting with pin my PC have
easy have a PC but no ordinary pin might
be seized I would have decided to do a
special rise in addition so these are
all gonna be design based systems
whether we're talking you know the
mainstream rising lineup of processors
rising 3 5 &amp;amp; 7 or the newer more
high-end desktop thread Ripper is also a
Zen based CPU so we're going to be
taking a look at some AMD based systems
more and more new AMD than old AMD this
is all exciting you know more and more
or less motherboards and parts that have
come out this year
very very latest Jenna you know I did an
AMD system you did an ad system it what
what which one the one I had for Rachel
that we handed off to her yes video
going up I posted that this morning the
build video I thought it went pretty
well it's on my channel and and Weaver
I've already handed it off to Rachel but
I have a follow up video with some
testing come on cool to go ahead and
plug it man
well go ahead and check that out on
Paul's channel if you want to see a
little mini I see a pretty sweet mini
ITX Verizon build I happen to get a peek
at it earlier this week but let's see
what Ross has in store for us Rasta
press the Rasta Nina he's got two
no that's I'm sorry mater you're awesome
Ross Taylor risin 7 1700 o'clock the 3.8
gigahertz respectable overclock there as
rock X 370 gaming k4a pally Paley PAC
pride pallet pallette
Oh pally super jet stream GTX GTX GTX
1070 and SSDs in there in hard times
ok let see what we got here oh you gotta
be quite silent loop from the looks of
it hey looks like there's another in the
wofe and very very cool actually
alright first impression here yep
knocked wha offers more placements
Corner corner pop on things for all
those fans that you got there you have
some nice matching fans in the rubber
mounts I believe they sell them I know
that they had them at CES like two years
ago they must be out they must sell them
yeah ok so get all those in red and your
color scheme will be will be on point
I mean brown and red isn't like awful as
a color scheme but I'm not I'm not
feeling it here yeah it's not true it's
not mission
it's like chocolate-covered strawberries
but not as delicious yeah oh that's a
good I agree here uh I say that I sided
with Paul I'm siding with Paul here even
if there were just black I feel like
just having a little bit of red in there
but with a black and white accents like
on your on your video card would look
really nice the brown does sort of throw
things off if for whatever reason they
aren't selling those knocked to a
corners anywhere you can't find them in
your country or something like that
they're pretty easy to spray-paint I
believe as long as you do it carefully
and you know what you're doing um yeah I
mean I I don't think that would be
terribly hard to spray-paint it I don't
I can't I feel like long term spray
spray painting over flexible little
corner pieces like that might but I mean
I don't know you can't move a much once
you once you're done unless you're done
with them you kind of just sit him in
there and and don't don't mess with them
too much ok a paint won't crack I this
is what I've heard I've heard like some
people in forms to talk about in the
past I've never done it personally
though so might want to double-check
that um
cable management here looks pretty good
for the most part with a couple notes
first off it looks like you've got a
bunch of cables coming from is that a
CPU fan header or a fan header or
something like that that's a triple
adapter and it comes with the be quiet
because no wait no it doesn't that's not
360 but yeah that's a that looks like a
three fan adapter it's for the Noctua
fans for sure yeah three not two or
three or four Nitro fans go into this
one splitter there might be a more
strategic CPU header for you to use as a
fan header sorry more strategic fan
header on the motherboard than that one
because that one's kind of front and
center quite literally and you might
want to go for one of the ones on the
bottom of the motherboard sort of sort
of sort of a tucked away maybe closer to
a rubber grommet in there those aren't
rubber grommets closer to a cutout
because it looks like it's just
stretching a little bit too far across
your motherboard and it's kind of
distracting
also the PCI you cable yeah that's what
was standing out to me the most sort of
like that's just it looks like it's
really windy in your case in the PCI you
can yeah flying like it's got its
handling it's on a rollercoaster ride or
something I'm not sure what's going on
there it's like it had a bad hair dude
so I don't know maybe soon everybody
gets Jay back yeah either straight back
or straight down and down and back maybe
instead of like up and over I don't know
you have to work with it a little bit
but it does look a little bit awkward
with the with the unused pins since
you're using one of those daisy chain
ones not daisy chain but you know what I
mean the multiple plugs on one cable
looks just a little bit strange just
sort of dangling off there in left field
so I take care of that but for the most
part everything else looks pretty good
um a lot of people are gonna freak out
that you put the waterblock of your
arrow sideways but that might be a
limitation with the with the socket the
tubes are probably too long he died
after you know completely upside down
and labor on the side they probably
drooped down so much and possibly
conflicts with the graphics card that I
guess mm-hmm I think yeah I can't be
sure but it might be a I think I checked
I checked in with be quiet on this if
be a limitation of the sake that it it
does not allow because they were
initially these coolers were initially
made for you know before risin came out
so yeah that name for adapter kind of
forces the the waterblock sideways but
what could you do
thank you very much Ross overall pretty
sweet-looking system that I'm sure
you're gonna have a lot of fun with next
that we've got new Andy new and B
weather rise in 1600 and a gtx 1080i in
the corsair crystal 460 x crystal case
this was the first pc he built and he's
pretty happy with how it turned out and
I can see why mr. mr. Andy it looks
pretty nice picture quality could be a
little bit better looks like your ticket
with a potato but we kind of get an idea
of what's like one of those one of those
old Nokia camera phones yeah a little
candy bar a little candy bar so um first
off I will say nice airflow in here you
got three front-facing or for fans at
the front that are pushing some nice air
to your graphics card there I'm a little
I'm a little surprised at your pairing
of choice with CPU and GPU I think a
rise in 1600 and a gtx 1080i isn't
something I commonly see but ain't gonna
knock it because I have it personally
tested those two components together I
don't think there's anything wrong with
it I don't think there's yeah I don't
think so either I just think in in
specific situations yes you could get a
little bit more performance out of that
1080i with you know going with the 7700
K or something like that but um it's
gonna be a good solution for gaming and
streaming of course it's done anything
I'm just saying it's uh you generally
don't see a 700 plus dollar video card
paired with a sub $200 CPU okay
um but if it's working out for you that
is awesome
and the cable management here looks
really good looks like you're taking
advantage of all the right grommets and
the one thing else say is that your
gotta take advantage of those grandma oh
yeah as our good friend and moderator
and chat right now cell processing
though he says every hole is a goal
we've got a cable coming off of the CPU
cooler here that looks a
little bit looks a bit we got a cowboy
here whoopee guys we got a cowboy here
he looks like he's going off the rails
woo could be tucked away yeah it could
be tucked away somehow maybe get a
little zip tie and you know did a little
bend it you know multiple times and pull
it up and crinkle it all nice and stuff
make it a bit more tidy but you know
it's black and sleeved thanks to AMD so
it doesn't look terrible doesn't stand
out too much
again if the picture quality was better
it probably no anymore I will also say
for our first to pit my pcs have been
going over here a shot of the system
with that with the side panels on
everything kind of like an external shot
would be nice to have oh yeah just to
give us just give us an idea when you're
not staring into the side pit and into
the sighted system yeah overall though
Andy very very nice especially for a
first time bill yeah Congrats on the
first one man
it's always the funnest thank you very
much Andy next up we've got the king
sorry I'm good yeah okay so we got a
fatality a be 350 gaining k4 and r5 1600
cpu clocked at 4.0 5 gigahertz Wow how'd
you get that that's pretty good
you got a winner there four point zero
five figure hurts on a 1600 another
pallet card to pay lifts in one day him
how does the broom
unique gtx 1060 this time around though
ejects rain here up six gigabytes I know
right we got so we got that global
audience yo we got 16 gigs of DDR for
Corsair lpx 29 33 megahertz better
timings though
and let's see Wow big ol knock to a
cooler then in HD 15 you brought the D
alright woah okay so I like that cooler
in here I'm a huge fan ah big CPU air
coolers I think they look pretty sweet
especially if you have an ugly
motherboard because they generally cover
them up oh yeah I can't even see ya like
you'll have no idea and you might have
this ugliest motherboard in the world
and it's perfectly fine doesn't bother
anyone
now I will say cable management here
it's probably not the best now it looks
like things are kind of crossing all
over the place things are not really
being
rounded in the appropriate holes again
with the holes a lot of loose a lot of
looseness Gila
yeah looks a little sloppy okay your fan
in the top right here does not match
with the other fans I mean your front
pins don't match with the rear fan
either all right granny you gotten back
to the fans in there anyway so I guess I
mean really really what's the biggest
fan fan force no yeah Neph word that's a
big faux pas that we got going on here
there's several I'm not sure how to
solve that problem for you yeah but it
looks like you could use a pretty decent
dusting though yeah absolutely it looks
like you've kind of done the the
haphazard like you know I feel like
we've had this before like people like
I'm gonna take a picture for Pitt my PC
they take this iPad off that oh it's
pretty dusty at night let me just wipe
off the top of the part my finger you
know they'll never know everything else
was perfect I know yeah look it's been
cleaned
yeah a bit more of a thorough dusting it
could help you out here as well that's
dust it off man dust it off also I will
say my OCD is going a little mad the
fact that you have the first or the left
nock to a fan the cable is facing us
ideally I'd probably have the cable like
flip the fan 180 degrees okay can stand
face it towards the motherboard that way
it's not so visible you just might be
able to do that without taking it off
the mount
you try would have to remove the
graphics card you can get it these
little metal tongs from the side yeah
yeah you can probably even if you gotta
remove the graphics cards on too big of
a deal um and some cable extensions
might be in order to than ketchup and
mustard you doing anyone no good alright
we need to take a short break
short for an attempt my PC yes we do
figure out what beer we're drinking even
do you want the shoe man we've got
Lapine du monde or shimei grand reserve
ale first person in chat to say their
preference is what we're gonna drink in
we haven't decided which
this is goblak how do I make this not
black I don't know I don't like you
looks okay for me
oh the first one was I think the ale
right Hale I am - who oh you mean like
we each get one are we gonna open and
share it oh I don't know why that I like
that okay that's a good idea
okay cool then we'll do that we're going
with the Elven wait this is the ale this
is a Belgian style triple ill and that
is a they're both of them now they're
both ales guys we got lots of ale going
on today see ok so what's an ale some L
said L love Fein left bean but family I
think is the most definitive out scope
it was the most definitive wine
definitive answer that was given first
okay I'm gonna open this do it and we
want to handle no I'm thinking of elf Oh
health have you seen that movie yeah of
course when he's in his dad's office and
he just keeps saying that name over and
over again
it's Francisco though he goes Francisco
Wow
oh my god that legitimately freaked me
out
sorry let's scare the hell I'm sorry a
headphone you usually usually you gotta
coax that a little bit oh my god yes
alright so Fernando has arisin 1600 in
here are five 1600 16 gigs of 32 hundred
megahertz ram at r9 270x and an MS I'd
be 350 tomahawk Arctic motherboard
inside of a 570 X white edition case
that is a beautiful case adding exhaust
SP 120 fan later on okay there's a nice
external shot yeah I like I like your
your motherboard and RAM carrying very
much
I think that looks pretty awesome I
think it's beautiful case your cable
management is actually pretty good
the 570 X I mean this is has been noted
in many reviews of it
it's got this sort of not how is
completes its a has a shroud a basement
yes so it's like what you're supposed to
say I can't I can't mouse over this and
that that thing so yeah from here it's
like okay you're fine yeah and then if
you succumb the Sun then from here yeah
and you know you can see that with a
tempered glass on there too y-yeah a
bunch of cables in here
I wouldn't they just had like a little
wall like they could have just they
didn't have to go all the way across
they want to preserve that look but they
should have at least just put like a
little garage door yeah you know agree I
don't know right beyond that though kale
management this is pretty tight in here
there's not not too much to be said
there you got a big EVGA the velcro
strap here I believe this is it for the
power supply I think I think he's got
two different cables here that have
daisy chains coming out the end maybe
that and that and that's holding them
down that's why they look it looks kind
of thick I've done that myself before it
might look a little bit less cumbersome
with a with a zip tie there instead of
the Big Ben velcro I mean if you wanna
tighten things up a little bit and then
the other thing standing out to me is
gonna be the I mean the stock here the
stock rise and heat sink fan here's it's
not awful I mean that does it's a good
for heat sink fan just the system seems
very like clean and tight looking and I
feel like something more I don't know a
bit more of it like the enter max enter
max has the ETS series yeah coolers and
they have a white version of that every
bike would look pretty nice in here yeah
Tony that's not like a $40.00 cooler
right I don't know if they have that
with a m4 coupe screw close bracket yeah
though I have to ask max about that but
yeah I agree yeah that's all I get yeah
slightly nicer you know maybe an
aftermarket CPU cooler I agree with Paul
there the fan cable on your rear fan
isn't the best it's ketchup and mustard
it looks like and that sticks out to me
so I would somehow I don't know replace
the fan or sleeve the cable okay if you
you know are willing to do that but for
the most part Fernando but uh no nice
it's gonna ask add an exhaust SP 120 fan
later oh yes that'll solve that little
fan there you go
ketchup and mustard bro you pull alright
one last honorable mention here yes this
is from Kyle not sharp not me is this is
a different kind of chef studios I just
thought this was a lovely little system
inside of the define C mini fractal
design beautiful custom loop here this
is actually I believe the a 240g kit
from ek which I we needed a video on
this as well I know I have one I didn't
do a video on it okay so yes it is a
pretty nice all-encompassing kits that
includes everything you need to cool
your CPU and GPU with a custom loop
including you know the pump and stuff so
it looks really nice like there are few
speak ever since hardline came around
speaking of our five 1600 spared with
1080 eyes though hey Wow five have been
that okay now all of a sudden now it's
commonplace and I eat all of my words
this is fantastic though ever since I
feel like hard line tubing became really
popular I have there haven't been many
soft tubing builds that I've liked the
look up this is one of the few that I do
it's actually looks really clean it's
also just look too sad she's just using
water distilled water I imagine it's so
fancy unless you must concern with clogs
or that kind of thing and I like how I
like how much of
the case is utilized yeah I like a full
I used to like it like wound cases just
were vacant I guess it depends on the
build but I've really grown to admire
just using up all the cases space you're
really taking advantage of all the the
mounting here with the radiator and
stuff like that so Bravo to you sir this
is an honorable mention you are
certified pimped in my book there's not
much I would do here to change it up you
could perhaps maybe add some dye in
there later to the liquid to the fluid
if you wanted to make it like a pastel
white like Paul is done and with arctic
panther in the past I think something
like a light like a bluish might oh yeah
might work in there too yep
I mean like the man to build it did but
yeah or or just leave it straight water
and and cuz that doesn't look bad at all
you know yeah okay anyway
all right thanks cow um wait any more
beer any breed around here there you go
give me that beer give it out yeah sure
how much half food how much you put in
right about there what about to where it
is announced but the bottom of where it
bubbles out a little bit weird bubs
where bubs
there we go beautiful thank you let's
pour it all okay I like the way you
think this is why we're friends I'm
ahead of the fiend Aman in a while I'll
get some more yeah all right cheers to
all of you thank you for joining us get
every last side a sturdy glasses every
last suds ease oaky a cheese toast
let's move on to our next segment ear
pull the audience we've done this one
before it yeah we asked if you entered
in I keep changing it well that's a
Scalia that's the audience at least
sounds good yep like it matters don't
get confused oh so so the way this
segment works is that we ask you guys a
series of questions you answer honestly
that's what makes the game more fun is
if you Anna's on answer if you a nest on
sir we everyone has a good time it's
already affecting us and Paul and I have
to guess what your answer will be which
is why it's important that you give us
the truth and then whoever is no lying
no lying allowed whoever answers
incorrectly has to take a large a large
gulp or serving of their drink and this
is nine percent beer healthy sweet so so
even like a large gulp like a really
large gulp is probably if I went to like
two large go is like it's like yeah it's
like two large Gophers in the blender my
regular Peter well set well set um so
this is our first question for you guys
let's blow up the question in chat let
me go ahead and paste it in oh I did
that too oh you did for Utah I did
twitch you got YouTube I'll get you to
keep doing so this is uh what percentage
oh here's a question so on top of it -
thank you so that's what percentage of
our audience titters themselves against
cryptocurrency mining now you have to
you have to and you see that I actually
put it's important that I that you see
that I gave them the option for being
different you feel so how do you feel
about it are you for it are you against
it or are you met
somewhere in the middle so answer answer
that and we have to guess you and I Paul
we have to guess percentage-wise
of how many of our viewers are against
it and we have to use divisible of 5% so
it has to be like you know 70% or 75% we
can't say $6 unison are we gonna follow
up this question with one where we asked
them about cryptocurrency mining
Crito I knew I knew there is a reason
strop hole underlined it in red I
figured they didn't know what crypto
krabi they're they're hip with some
bitch what's going on right now and step
it's a little typo but alright so um
I've been wrong before
all right has no feel so I'm gonna give
this first one to you Paul you can guess
first in a divisible Sanders people are
against it against it
yes our viewers knowing our audience and
and how they are and 16 their
beautifulness 60 60 percent Wow okay I'm
gonna I'm gonna say 60% because gamers
are very frustrated with just the fact
that they can't get all the cards right
now I'm true and anyone who's looking to
has been looking to upgrade anyone who's
like a new like who's just getting into
it right now like it kind of sucks cuz
the the the main prime like 250 bucks is
your is your most my words a failing me
right now 250 bucks is is historically
the price of a GPU that is most popular
there's a lot more people buying $250
GPUs that are 400 or 500 or 600 or
whatever like that yeah train so okay so
right now it's like you can't buy a $250
GPU for return $50 you have to buy the
Turner 50 GB for 350 or whatever like
that you know and I think a lot of
people are frustrated with it you know
of course there's a lot of people are
gonna be like I love cryptocurrency
mining after me at that I just think
that's a smaller number of people right
and I'm sure they're very vocal and
everything and they have the reasons and
hey you're making money yeah more power
to you yeah yeah yeah that's that's
where I'm at
and I'm gonna say cuz I agree with you
for the most part but since I have to
get something differently and I don't
wanna be super cheap about it I'm gonna
say 50% because I feel like I feel like
there are more people who are against it
right now than supporting it but I also
feel like there's a large group of
people who are just sort of have mixed
feelings so I feel like there are gonna
be quite a few people that are
indifferent who don't care either way
it's okay that's legal whatever do what
you want it kind of sucks for everyone
else but you know it is what in this
type of thing so I'm gonna say 50%
because I think it's gonna be like 50
percent against it and like maybe 35
percent in support of it and then the
rest of them being in the middle but
yeah that so you got that that
indifferent crowd yeah you never know
can switch it up we don't know what
they're gonna think with their their
difference difference alright so let's
see what we got oh wow Wow alright we're
way off holy crap you win there's a lot
of you 2% a lot of people who are
differents people don't care yeah so so
what it seems to be is like a loud
minority or a louder minority and it's
not terribly in my note and and the
people who are vocal about it of the
people who are looking to buy GPM course
course in it frustrated yeah but there's
lots of people who have gaming systems
already who maybe are into PC building
but if you're sitting on a you know if
you've got any 900 or they're 10000
10000 series Nvidia graphics card or you
know any of the 500 series if you're a
very I got a graphics card you like I'm
not looking to buy a new one then right
yeah
what would you care yeah it's true
alright very interesting kinda way those
answers guys so I win and and you're
gonna we'll save the the punishment sips
for the end of this second I'd rather
just drink or you can do it now you take
a big gulp though you have to take like
a double shot or a triple shot that is a
really big gold pen tupples shop that
was a big gold
so fluid just go down like yeah quite a
bit all right good job all right so
let's move on to the second question
here the second question is a little bit
more simple
how many drives does the average viewer
have in their PC how many drives does
our average viewer have in their PC go
ahead answer it
embrace it oh I was supposed to be wait
why doesn't it why can't I happy
oh yes already did in YouTube yay Thank
You self Sal you're a lifesaver
you guys got it we're just talking about
SSDs and hard drives here Paul we're
emitting optical drives
okay the drives I'm talking about ours
are you know hard storage and stuff not
not optical media so between SSDs and
hard drives how many drives do you think
the average viewer has in their main
desktop PC ok I'm gonna go first this
time bastard I'm gonna say are you going
here
so obviously not zero you need an
operating system lay down one drive
perhaps oh boy but I feel like most of
our audience members who watch this show
are typically savvy enough to sort of
spread out their workload or spread out
their their workflow across multiple
drives we're all kind of a in tune with
the idea that it's it's a good it's good
to have you know a smaller size SSD for
your boot drive and a larger mechanical
storage for for for media and stuff so
I'm gonna say two drives I'm gonna say
two and I know that there are a lot of
you guys out there who have like eight
dry stacked to the T but I think most of
us especially like the budget oriented
builders we're gonna go with two drives
that's that's my pick
that's how many I would have for like a
mid-range to low-end system okay I'm
gonna go with three yeah because that's
that's the other that's the other most
likely because yeah yeah because raid
you might want to be raiding stuff you
might you might want that third drive
for whatever comes to mind
not even he is you said it
Ted Cruz all right um hashtag Ted Cruz
okay all right are we giving people
enough time here I think so should I
think I should delay this isn't really
like a thinking question yeah like right
I have this many so let's look at matter
how you feel exactly how many I feel
like I'm in charge how many drinks do
you feel like you to but I really feel I
can't force my hard drives I partition
in like 20 different drafts or just feel
like I have all these hardships yeah
phantom friends do it things invisibly
alright a nurse I've ever encountered
someone who does it like you do those
crazy for designations either right
those people are weird I don't think
guys are those people all right let's
see what you guys said oh yeah I totally
all right glammo second with three Wow
two hundred and eighty three votes for
two drives who three and then one Wow
I mean that's it's the configuration to
go for it yeah you know you got your SSD
and then you get a hard drive and then
indeed blah blah indeed well well well
well well well I'm just a live fire
right if people have no drives one five
people yes they probably don't have a
computer either yeah or they're just
full of it
you guys alright they just it means they
boot off of like a puff of a stick
SD card or something cuz I'm feeling dry
I says these solid-state drive even
though it's all state media
oh you're splitting hairs here okay but
you do have to take a large drink once
again of your of your punishment ale mmm
punishment ale drink it up really good I
feel bad I know I I wish I lost more so
whose here's Oh she'll lose the next one
here's the sort of fun question I just
threw in all right it's it's really
meaningless but sort of silly
nonetheless who's the last person who's
the last person on earth you'd wish to
spend the rest of your life alone with
alright it's you and one other person or
thing on planet earth for the rest of
eternity
alright who's it gonna be who or who's
the last person you'd want it you spend
your time with the options here are
Donald Trump and we make no political
comment to touch to that I'm saying here
saying saying Donald Trump doesn't
introduce politics at all it sure does
not know it sure does not Paul neither
does Barney the Dinosaur
but yet he's on the list we've also got
Martin shkreli the the pharma bro I'm
not supposed to say his name but he's
like Voldemort no all he wants his
attention that's all I want
well he capable talking about him he
doesn't care Pete that people hate him
he just wants people to talk about him
so by talking about him he doing what do
you want he can't even get attention
anymore because he was banned on Twitter
can he keep it away from me asshole he
can continue to be a shitty person look
look how shitty this guy is like yeah
that's what he wants he wants to be in
the news again being shitty which is why
he well thank God we're not real tech
that were not real news yeah she and we
got a Kardashian hi a cute puppy that
humps your leg non-stop until you die
even when you're sleeping my god
so those are your options that's not a
person I mean well yeah split hairs here
yeah but you say okay fine let's let's
assume there's my guy dressed up as you
might attribute that to other it's a
three items on this
as well hmm excuse me all right I get to
go first you get to go first
so who not remember it's not who you
think it's it's who you think the
audience would least want to spend the
rest of their life with so who do you
think our audience is I think it's gonna
be Donald Trump you think it's Nam Trump
I don't to go into my reasons I just
think I just think that's what it's
gonna be
it's kind of hard not to not to pick the
most controversial president ever or one
of the most controversial presidents
ever um but since I can't go the same
route you are Paul I'm gonna have to go
with Martin shkreli I think he would be
I think Donald Trump at least would like
would humor me like if it was just me
and him on earth he would have no people
to govern okay it wouldn't be that bad
if anything he'd just be an asshole
idiot
but Martin shkreli would just be like
royally douche-baggy and probably
charged me for like all the coconuts
that we find on the island
somehow we're on an island all of a
sudden Disney castaway disrespected the
wu-tang clan he disrespected whoo he
disrespected the clan they don't go by
movie I probably just I probably and
producer I would strangle him I just
strangle him to death universe right now
I get to spend the rest of my life alone
maybe you'd want to spend it with him
just you kill him and no one else would
you'd never get persecuted for it all
right but I don't I don't want to kill
anyone Kyle that's that's not nice but
if I mean I would I'm not saying I
wouldn't I'm really not nice I don't
want to know what on that list is nice I
have no other option except Barney
Barney's kind of nice but everyone else
sucks all right let's see what you guys
thought let's see who is the last person
on earth you would want to spend the
rest of your life alone with Wow - Ian
beets that's how deep Donald Trump well
you know what this is I still win you
still you still win by a landslide has
shkreli z' down at the bottom look so
that means people would rather spend
most of our audience
the rest of their lives Skrillex Martin
shkreli
that's what that is the logical I think
you take logic with this question I
didn't know you guys had a thing I'm
gonna stop talking on him I thought
I knew you
I mean I thought I knew all of damn
thing about you wow what an upset
what an upset well you definitely won
that one rising go thank you you
definitely won so okay so like you puppy
was holdin her you weren't very specific
a Kardashian does it matter
that's the question I was gonna specify
I thought about this is like I should
specify like no they're all terrible
they're all equally terrible any
Kardashian it does not matter which one
or any one they're associated with okay
which if if we did a poll if we did a
follow-up poll which Kardashian would
you least likely want to spend the rest
of your life with and we list them all
out I couldn't I don't know Kim I know
that's Kim they're not yours
that's why it doesn't matter cuz you
don't even know which ones they are you
just a second well I actively like I
don't click I like it but if there's if
it's if I'm randomly browsing and I see
that like a story and I'm like oh maybe
I'll click on that and I see Kardashian
like no no I don't want people to think
that's engagement you don't want to have
them engage people wanna click on that
right yeah Rob you're somebody said Rob
I dunno
you're right you could get stuck with
Rob that maybe that is what the big
concern was there okay anyway is what it
what a what an eventful segment that was
yeah all right so that's the audience
everyone next okay let's move on to our
third segment here which is a brand new
one this way hey just a minute today's
new lower thirds yep it's not face off
its
kaiza whoo yeah it's a very simple
premise
actually we take a look at two trending
cases in the PCB iy market that are
either a heavy they're just launched or
are in the process of being launched
we're going to launch soon and we take a
look at the specs of each one and
determine
the end of the round which one we would
rather build it it's exciting it's super
exciting it's called case off it's so
fun because it sort of sounds like
face-off but it's with cases I'm excited
it's awesome
all right gigabyte gigabyte has come out
or is coming out with a new case today
is the line up between there horas AC
300 W versus LAN Lee's new Mini ITX
chassis the PC q39
alright so we've got we've got these two
contenders at each other's throats let's
let's take a look first the gigabyte or
si si 300 W let's do that all right this
is from PC Authority calm thanks for the
specs guys this is an ATX not a burp not
an ati expert an ATX mid tower case
pretty pretty open internally they're
very open you can see it's got a fairly
nice PSU shroud okay and it's got an
acrylic side panel window here's the
full specs full specs right there so
side panel window good acrylic bad
everyone read all that IMO okay RGB
lighting as we saw in the the initial
picture there at the top has RGB
lighting both on the front and circle it
has a side panel but it's acrylic yes a
window yeah well it didn't specifically
say acrylic but it's not timber glass so
it's probably some sort of plexi they
would say if it was tempered glass
absolutely yeah
so we've also got you know apart from
RGB we've got a front panel HDMI so if
you want to do some V arts it's a VR
oriented chassis design with VR in mind
okay it's also supporting horizontal or
vertical GPU mounting so ha if you
wanted to show off these tools CCNE er
new GPUs lets you take your graphics
card and show ours just inside of it
let's get more popular which is it's
getting more more popular but also I
mean like the you gotta buy an expansion
you got to buy a PCIe riser for it right
yes Mike it doesn't come with that I
don't doesn't come with it
I don't know cuz I'd should I feel like
they shouldn't advertise that if it
doesn't come up unless it comes with the
riser to actually do because those can
does can range in price yeah and the
shitty ones are shitty right
like like you you get you get very
minimal drop-off in performance with the
nicer ones the the shitty ones actually
the power delivery and you can be what
what's the main problem with those but
those can actually cause the performance
of your graphics card to suffer but I
would also say in a case like this like
it's a it's a solid side panel window
you put your graphics card on the side
there is that gonna be starved for air
at all is it right up yeah it's that and
it's it looks like it would be and it
wouldn't really be in the direct path of
whatever front fans you have installed
so that kind of concerns me as well it
might be one of those aesthetic yes
decisions that really isn't that
intelligent overall yes you or perhaps
if you're building a more about
mid-range machine let's say you have a
tense gtx 1060 or an Oryx 580 and below
it's probably not gonna get very hot
because it's not just not a super fast
card and that should be fine but
anything above that do we have a price
for this we have a hundred dollar price
point hundred dollars hundred dollars
alright look at those LED accents what
I'm disappointed here it with is that
there's no if you look at the side
profile there's no rubber grommets it
looks like they're just regular cutouts
I feel like for a hundred dollar case of
these yeah for 100 our case these days
grommets should come standard I feel
like it's 2017 I agree um but apart from
that it looks like a pretty promising
case from gigabyte let's look at our
next one though
Leanne Lee is also packing in a pretty
nice package with their PC q39 however
this is a very different case than the
one we just looked at this is a mini ITX
chassis with a very boxy design okay
it's not the first time that Liam Lee
has has gone this route with their
chassis we only have one picture of this
no yeah that's unfortunate I know it's
weird because it's the it's it's the
power supply cable management side and
not the beauty side with like the
motherboard and CPU a graphics card but
yeah but maybe you can find some more
pictures there so this case unlike the
Auris one has a tempered glass side
panel in typically only fashions what's
the price for this one $200 - oh so I
get so so that's the conundrum right
you're you're talking as much smaller
form factor limited hardware options
twice as expensive however
but perhaps maybe higher quality
component or materials like the tempered
glass side panel and aluminum
construction fine with liam lee cases
alright Liam has bugged me with this
that I didn't build in there many at no
groomers in this case no grommets Keon
I know for Tudor dollars have these
little plastic panels that mount over
them yeah but let's you cover them up
which which are okay but not a
replacement for the rubber grommets a
few definitely not and it's weird
because they have like the water cooling
tube grommets there yeah but they don't
have ones for like your 24 pen ATX that
you're definitely going to use so yeah
it's a slightly disappointing it's
interesting um again dual chamber design
so you've got sort of a similar layout
does we see with like something like the
air 540 where you've got you know
motherboard CPU and GPU on one side and
your power supply and all your cabling
and perhaps your hard drives on the
other so that's kind of a cool split
orientation there we also have front
panel USB 3.1 types eat gently oh that's
nice that is really nice you don't see
too many cases we're starting to see
more cases with that front panel feature
it's nice that this one has it you get
two three and a half inch in two three
two and a half inch drive mounts it can
fit up to a 240 millimeter rad we do not
know what kind of radiator support the
Auris case has it was not listed fans
were listed fan mounts were listed but
not necessarily radiators and they're
looking me we're looking at an end tech
article right now by the way goes for
the landlady pcq third and then they
have some more pictures yeah so check it
out
and ntek so again this can fit a 240
millimeter rad but let's let's get down
to the to the the wire here which case
paul if you had the chance today to
build in one of them which one would you
go with let's say you had to spend your
own money to purchase this case and
build inside of it what do you think
what do you think even going this is
case off after all we need a definitive
Victor here I already know mine okay
um neither you
you can't why do that I can't do the
hell you can't do it saying neither kid
I can't say neither case no attendees aw
I can't say that they both seem
overpriced to me there are no drawers
there no drawers there it even says it
in the rules right here there are no
drawers right next to where it says case
off Harry and I didn't just type that
right now are people voting on this is
there people aren't people aren't really
voting although I could make them we can
enhance the sexy now this one is
becoming better as we speak and by case
off is evolvers you're watching the
evolution of case off create poll as you
can you can in the future you know I was
there when case off became what it is
now with massive behemoth of online
judgement of cases before they even had
 up which is now obviously global
phenomena phenomena yeah but it's
already kicking storm bet you guys were
here day one old my Stewart day what you
saw it here first so all right so people
are voting night I put the link in there
you guys should be thing to chat why are
they saying don't vote don't vote
because they agreed with me that neither
of these cases are worth buying is that
what it is you have to choose those are
a song you have to pick a case all right
you have to make a case for okay the
lesser of two evils the lesser of two
evils is what we're going for
all right I didn't say that either of
them would be ideal okay the Gigabyte
I'd rather waste $100 into it Wow what
I've go with that's what I'm gonna buck
all right the gigabyte so simply because
you're not a huge fan of either case and
so you just want to spend you want to
waste the least amount of money yeah
that is a perfect valid also it's a new
case you know from gigabyte so there's
like a little gecko gigabyte doesn't
make cases so the resale value might be
there you get almost the actual full
amount for it and they can
actual case has better specs features
for like 80 bucks young for like you
practice air or literally anywhere max
okay yeah it wouldn't have that aura
slogan I I have you say I would miss
that or slow go yeah the front doesn't
look bad it doesn't look bad
I just looks okay yeah it looks fine it
just it doesn't doesn't look like
something I'd pay a hundred bucks
there's nothing inspiring about it
there's nothing like me there's like $60
cases with tempered glass side panel
windows yeah yeah they're definitely
armed anyway yep I don't agree with you
Paul okay that pain two dollars for a
mini ITX Leland case sorry yeah
oh the mini ITX one this is a new low
the only one that's mini ITX miss that
thoughts real I said three times why did
you have to show either the Zetas oh no
you're right it's maybe be over it stop
talking I can't I can't have you for
that alright well that was case off
beautiful segment I love it that's all
that's that's the entire segment I
thought there were two cases no there
wasn't one cases I thought I mean two
case offs yeah that there were two I
thought case off was split in two
uh no I didn't find any other there's
been a dearth of just tech news and like
new hardware coming up I liked it I
liked this segment I think you bring the
segment back and it's very very
successful I think it's fun and I think
what happened to the pole can we forget
it cuz we get an answer in the bowl
let's take a look at the pole here right
did you posted
let's see Oh busted mr. duck right now
I got it all right so let's see what you
guys thought what if it's just zero
no one cares good I win all the whores
wins I will get to what I pick the
whores too I picked it first
okay you're right well well done you
have to drink yes okay I will drink I
will drink MMH I think there is
potential for the segment though for
example if there is more cases that are
just coming out in a given week then we
can do multiple rounds yeah so just this
one and we can also you know amp up the
the punishment is especially good to
pass judgment on the cases when we
haven't physically touched them
absolutely
oh it's like totally just first
impression completely uninformed it's
it's it's quintessential to this show so
let's talk about some tech news I only
have what does hero doing I don't know
he's like nudging the lighting kit and
stuff here's kind of rolling around in
his bed and snorting he's having too
much fun down just up in the light here
he's like doing the worm good boy the
boy he's a good boy big boy okay all
right let's move on to some tech news
this is gonna be really quick because we
are slightly short on time there's only
two little articles here that I picked
out we've got more news to talk about on
paulus half this is really quick just
about the 8700 k at the core i7 copulate
processor from Intel the six core six
core 12 thread behemoths that we've been
hearing so much about this is from video
cards calm the articles they were
following a story after Carl Moore in
the Canadian tech journalist came across
an HP omen desktop PC that actually was
fitted with an 80 700 K CPU AHA since he
was sort of with an HP rep at the time
there was no display attached to the to
the desktop he actually ran in like
quickly borrowed somebody else's monitor
so he could hook it up and run some
benchmarks on it sadly in the middle of
the show for something which is awesome
so props to you Carl for making it
happen so he actually did run some tests
in Cinebench
and cpu-z so for the Cinebench he did
single and multi-threaded tests there
was no mention of whether or not the CPU
is overclocked so take these you know
everything here with a grain of salt
looks like it's running at 3.7 gigahertz
aha
during this appears to be during the oh
yeah oh yes I do not see that slide good
research Paul so this is gonna be
Stockton so we've got twelve hundred and
thirty marks for our multi-threaded test
in Cinebench and if you want to compare
that to the rise in 1600 you can see
right below it is rising sixteen hundred
at eleven hundred and thirty so in
multi-threaded performance at least
instant a bench according to this
article the 8700 K is going to
outperform the 1600 by about I don't
know what is that fifteen percent maybe
I'm not sure put me on those numbers but
the 1600 you can buy for less than two
hundred bucks right now yes usually yes
and 8700 K is gonna be at least a
hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars
more you would expect if they're doing
at all with the pricing scheme or the
top ends um main stream processor so
it's expected to be around three hundred
fifty bucks maybe even as much as four
hundred ooh they've charged for like two
seventy seven hundred K that's 67
hundred K in the past but perhaps the
effect that AMD's got now is competing
now well maybe with that a little bit
more reasonable hopefully for the
consumer we've got single-threaded marks
at 196 there was no rise in sixteen
hundred comparison for that so you guys
can do some research to find out exactly
how that stacks up most likely it's
going to be a bit higher than 1600 as
well he also read the CPUC benchmark
with a multi-threaded score of thirty
six hundred and eighty and a
single-threaded
score of twenty two hundred and forty
three you guys can go ahead and check
that article out if you wanted to
compare them to other scores that you
might have at home or ones that you look
up online the next leg comes from
Geekbench it's pretty much showing the
8700 k 8700 k to be on par with the 7700
k when it comes to single 30 performance
maybe just a slight uptick and higher
multi-core of course as you would expect
with two additional course and four
threats so again 7702 a fork or a thread
part with six core and 12 threads on the
8700 k based on some leaked pictures in
this article we actually get to get a
look at the under the underbelly of the
cpu 700k we can actually see according
to the article that the pin layout is
identical to what we've seen on the 7700
k which begs the question if the pin
layout on coffee lake eighth-generation
cpus is the same as last gen then why is
intel restricting compatibility with
existing 200 series motherboards I think
the simple answer to that is they want
that cash money but no one can be buying
new motherboards you gotta buy a 3
Series motherboard now why would utilize
a nice why would you want a new CPU in
an old motherboard pal
because you would want a new CPU in a
new motherboard no not everyone does
Paul because some people are perfectly
happy with their last gen motherboard
and they want to save money because
they're not mmm they're not fricking
rich and they just they they it's nice
that's what's nice about Rison is it
Rison has an upgrade path a very nice
upgrade path you can start off be 350
chipset get a motherboard for under 100
bucks or so start off with a sub $150
CPU and by the end of 2018 you're
rocking an 8 core monster baby I'm
really bad at it sort of improvisational
Oh outbursts but you get you catch my
drift
whereas you know Intel seems to sort of
lock you in and sort of and make thing
and Andy and his promise the ex the am
for socket and that platform lifespan
will be until 2021 to 20 so it's another
three years give or take from now I
can't wait for that year which which
you'd have to assume that Zen 2 which
has there's been a little bit of buzz
but Zen two here and there lately so
you'd have to assume the Zen 2 will be
compatible with a m4 and
their existing platform I don't know if
they're gonna come out with new
motherboards and a new chipset or
anything like that but yeah we'll see
what happens piano player makes a good
point too for for him it's because he
doesn't want to have to go through the
the work of swapping out the motherboard
right if he's already got an existing
system it's nice to just swap in the CPU
you all have to do is remove the cooler
and instead of like literally
disconnecting every part of your system
so I do I do get what you're saying
there piano player thanks for the input
um but don't move on to our last story
for today which is about I don't know
how to pronounce this Miami is Iommi's
Iommi's me or my meet me me Naomi's
Iommi's I Oh me me no no no confusing
this is article from The Next Web com
this is about these I Oh me me notebook
Pro which is supposed to compete pretty
closely I guess with the MacBook Pro
Windows Windows PC of course this laptop
we've got a 15.6 inch display I would
imagine
IPS but don't call me it doesn't it
doesn't mention here very very narrow
bezel it's a super sleek and sexy a
little laptop here we got a quad core i7
not exactly sure if that's that must be
calculating I would imagine 16 gigs of
ddr3 purpose our ITV or for up to one
terabyte of SSD storage and it's also
featuring in videos new MX 150 the
geforce MX 150 which is basically
supposed to be a more robust alternative
to Intel integrated graphics so Nvidia
is actually telling it to be four times
as capable as Intel's HD graphics 520
which means that it probably can't
handle doom or battlefield one but if
you want to run some lighter
applications like csgo or maybe dota 2
you should be able in theory to run that
no problem on this laptop which is kind
of cool you've also got two USB C ports
that's really nice a card reader full
size HDMI I'm a huge fan of that
fingerprint sensor built right into the
trackpad that's pretty sweet
980 dollars is the MSR
P available only in China for now sucks
so if you were really interested you may
have to hit up a an obscure Chinese
reseller now I gotta go to China or or
just take a day trip to Beijing or
something like that it's a quick flight
across the Pacific yep buy your laptop
and come back you'll spend a lot more on
the plane ticket perhaps but that's
pretty much all you got for today's my
half of the show guys we can go ahead
and dive right into our donation

NB 67 for the $20 donation here's 20
bucks because you're so pro Tata's well
yeah who's not if everyone who is pro
Tata's got 20 bucks we'd all be written
everyone would have 20 bucks we could
all be 20 dollars richer yeah thank you
very much VI communism more than ever
because everyone gets more on communism
on Paul's hot pup Shepard 5 bucks
I was contacted by air MCN on my youtube
channel after passing 140 subs what is
your experience in choosing an MCN do
you still have pup shepherd shirt I
think I still do have a pup shepherd
shirt pup it is somewhere believe it or
not I have like literally over a hundred
shirts now that I feel like you never
get rid of shirts I I don't I haven't
gotten rid of shirts in the wild because
I just haven't made the time to do it
but I should so you have you shirt take
a picture of all the shirts I'd say well
if there's a shirt cuz it's like
sometimes you have a shirt and you wore
that shirt a lot you're like I like that
shirt yeah I would go in my by my drawer
of shirts and be like I'm gonna wear
that shirt that's my like that shouldn't
that eventually faded whatever you put
in a different piyo and then you start I
start wearing a little bit less
eventually you gotta let go yeah
so if it was a shirt that you were fond
of that you had good times in snap a
picture of it you know I'll go there my
shirts and my car and I say I'm gonna
I'm gonna get rid of this this this and
this this I feel bad cuz you know we we
had good times together but it's that so
do you have like a photo album on your
rig that's backed up onto a raid array
that's just titled shirts no that would
have been really happy to know that if
that they just on my cell phone record
okay that's a good idea though I like
that idea
and it has nothing to do with the fact
that I it's hard it's hard for me to
part with
I just really haven't gotten around to
like soaring through it it's a process
like for how many shirts I have it it's
okay I want to keep this I want to keep
that oh yes I should definitely go any
throws pup the other question you had
what's your experience in choosing an
MCN mm it was a pretty easy choice for
me I ate read reviews and watched
YouTube videos about fullscreen which is
who I'm partnered with now as well as
Paul as well as Jay we're all parted
with fullscreen I think line it's 2-2
now okay so I know he's with twitch with
for a while he was but which isn't
really an MCN that's true there's sort
of that yeah anyway but um yeah there's
just you do research you're just big and
yeah exactly yeah if if an M scene is
willing to have you look at their
contract first and and try to reach out
to several MC ends and read all of their
contracts at the same time and find out
which one works for you alright thank
you very much pup
jujubee's for the $10 donation because I
missed a couple weeks hi hi hey
jujubee's thank you very much appreciate
that you should miss a couple weeks more
often we'd be ten dollars richer alright
uh edita Aditi is arrived Aditya yeah
for 100 rupees if you feel like I'm
playing Legend of Zelda should I get
Rison v 1500 X or an i5 7400 any tips
they're gonna be paired with the GTX
1050 Ti hmm wow you know I would say
Rison because you have the upgrade back
that's me yeah just right off the bat
because let's say this was the last
computer you'd ever build didn't I feel
like you can't go wrong either way
they're both good options but if you are
going to continue to be a PC user and
gamer in the future then Rison allows
you to sort of upgrade to higher core
higher frequency processors without
having to swap out your motherboard or
change the chipset and things like that
I concur
short answer Alex McNab books by the
British pounds love both your contents
best rise an upgrade from an FX 95 90
again I go with an 8 core if you like to
kind of make
sure you're not going from an eight-core
to something less than an eighth course
I'd say a 1700 yeah there you go
I concur there are 1700 X I mean if if
if X is a reasonable deal if X is 10 or
20 bucks more than the naught X then I'd
say go for it because xfr does seem to
perform a little bit better with the
excuse but yeah that's that's what I
would say cool
des or e for the $20 thank you very much
sure took Paul's advice last week and
bought the fantex and through elite pays
for my monster thread Ripper 1950 ex
build picks coming we would love to see
them Congrats on that purchase sir that
sounds pretty epic that is no easy
purchase it's not no purchase for the
faint of heart I can't wait to see what
that prints as a labor of love right
they're actually a little tidbit I
actually do have a amenity we'll eat to
built and then through elite build a lot
of perks the stream you're gonna do an
end to leave doing an end to elite build
Bryce cuz you have room now I have to
actually like like seriously this empty
this build was supposed to happen like a
month ago like two months ago and I told
friends eggs I was like no do not send
it to our house yet we're moving into a
new office send it once we're all
settled in there because I literally
have nowhere to put it so
congratulations the Missouri should be
pretty awesome can't wait to see some
pictures the right Jenek for the $20
what oh sorry no you're right you're
right
register $20 my wife is getting PC parts
for Christmas she wants a heaping pile
of unicorn puke is there any issue going
with 4 by 4 gig of ram for RGB
fulfilling us going with a risin 5 1600
gtx 1070 and a b3 50s 340 elite case her
first build by the way there well any
issue no there's no issue with it really
the only issue would be that since you
only have four dimm slots you wouldn't
be able to expand your ram in the future
but 16 gigs which is what you would be
putting in that system is probably
plenty for your wife for a very long
time yeah so I wouldn't think twice
about it I would just go for it
especially if that's like the look
you're trying to go for us and some
people just really like the look of
having all the DIMM slots populated so
the couple empty ones it recommends
either G skills RGB kit Coursera's RGB
kit or I've seen team team team has a
there RGB oh yeah is now out there as
well
right oh very cool yep thank you very
much rich mixer that's a generous
donation Nate penny for the five bucks I
have an AMD FX 8350 hundred X or 1600
and how much performance gain can I
expect
I play all blizzard games so blizzard
games I believe are pretty CPU intensive
no they're not they're not I mean I mean
blizzard games are very well optimized
they're very well optimized you can play
them on just about anything yeah you're
willing to scale some of the settings
and that kind of thing right I'd say
there's definitely a performance uptick
that you would experience that you'd be
able to feel for making that upgrade
8320 is a good chip but it's definitely
dated 1500 X or 1600 it really depends
on your budget can you afford the 1600
reasonably well without like regretting
it later then get it if you can't the
1500 X is going to be a formidable
option yeah either way your your golden
brother
thank you very much mate yep Larry Larry
$5 what does it say shout out loud ah
thanks Larry thanks I hammer slap for
the five bucks since Paul has a series
called probing Paul your segment asked
the audience should be called probing
yellow oh I like it
oh it's very good okay I think we found
a new names better we can finally settle
on it's probing yellow yes I like that I
did yeah study for the hundred rupees
again hey Kyle you didn't read my last
super chat yes we did we did but we read
them at the end reddit of each half you
must be new here at each so we've now
fooled you into donating twice haha Alex
McNabb for the 10 British Council also
the 95 90 question paired at the moment
with two 980 T is still the same answer
same answer thanks Alex Heather Hansen

Thank You Steven oh we know an empty
we're almost ready almost ready for the
next the next one cell processing
stopped itself stop donating so we
should be paying you I push for
automatic match I wanted you to know you
are an important member of the aww
community you will be missed aw maybe
he's a W or H there's a typo or aw aw
like but if you have some secret Club
there in part of that we're not I mean
that's sort of this important but
they're left out I've you know
cells just trying to show some love I
just feel like we've never been invited

cut us to the core of our beings and
make us feel i I just want to make the

Matt El Jefe reviews $5.00 up gents any
special builds coming up I did mention
the enfili build that I have in the
works
Paul you're doing uh yeah I've got to
follow up to the a.m. for mini tix build
it should be up in another day or two
arctic Panthers coming up within the
next week or two and I've also got a way
from I'm gonna build I'm gonna build my
entry level my entry level X 399 system
no I still need to probably buy a 1900 X
and maybe do some hair since for that
because that was the biggest complaint
for that was like people are like 1900 X
makes no sense so I kinda wanna maybe do
some this with that and see yeah see if
there is any practical use for it it
sounds fun but thank you very much El
Jefe hope you're doing well to roman
troop gain for the 300 truckin rubs
tracking are you beat I'm not sure what
that is Ruby's Romanian Ruby's Russian I
like that shoutout from Russia Russia a
Russian your your hope hope X 300 K bit
wit I'm about to build a PC and fantex
shift similar to your HTPC how you think
is it possible to install water-cooled
GPU in that case something like EVGA
hybrid I heard they get rubles rubles ok
I write it's Russian ruble Russian
rubles um I think it is it might be
possible depending on the aftermarket
cooler that you use to mount as long as
it's a 120 millimeter radiator and
nothing more
mounting that to the bottom of the case
might actually work that is the only
radiator mounting point viable radiator
mounting point inside of the shift
unless you go shift X then you've got
more options but if you're just talking
shift that's probably your best bet you
have to go with an air cooler for your
CPU and you might be able to get away
with a 120 read for your GPU mounted at
the bottom of the case as long as your
GPU is not too long
because if it's too long it's gonna
interfere with the rad and the fan
mounted to it because the remember the
the the GP was mounted vertically it's
gonna be pointing straight at the bottom
of your case so bear that in mind but
good luck on that people need to stop
donating because we need to and God hath
my half so we can open the next beer yes
indeed alright so we're gonna cut off
donations right now do not donate any
more your your message will not be read
your messages will not be read we have
to move on but thank you we love you I'm
ninety nine nine five dollars hi guys
low FPS with 4790k at 4.6 gigahertz
forty percent usage and gtx 980ti hybrid
at twenty fifty megahertz fifty percent
usage any suggestions you're not giving
us any information about what you tests
you're running games you're using and
that kind of thing right is this
minecraft or i mean it sounds like from
your specs and everything like you have
a very nice solid system and set up an
overclock and everything so if you're
talking about in one game the 4790k is
it we have forty percent usage but your
1080i should be at a hundred percent in
that case in another game your 1080i is
less usage and CPUs and hundred-percent
those are just games that are bottled
like one way or the other some games are
more CPU intensive so game some more GPU
intensive if it's the same way all
around maybe a software issue I'd maybe
consider something like yeah the
installation of Windows right and
installation of drivers would be that'd
be the way I would go about trying yeah
that make sure that no CPU cores are
parked or anything like that and weird
overclock setting you know run
everything it stopped default go into
your BIOS reset to you know factory
defaults try the test again
yeah also to chula and chat says do you
have a few cores at 100% and then some
or at zero I mean are you looking at all
of your cores right yeah some games are
gonna use more cores than others exactly
missed missed xtube for five Canadian
Linus 20 or 1290 by 1080 video had
