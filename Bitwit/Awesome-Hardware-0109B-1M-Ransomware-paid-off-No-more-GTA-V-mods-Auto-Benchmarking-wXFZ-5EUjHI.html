feel like we're doing I can just say
that generically and feel like yeah that
seems about it that seems yeah okay yeah
sure I mean the fact that there's still
seven people watching us
yeah it just went up like five viewers
so they're they're all good people they
must all be blind and deaf
no they're seven hundred discerning
colors they are discerning people
looking for the next generation of
entertainment which includes information
or or they're designed or they've drunk
to rank as much as we have or they're
inebriated yeah and they're like man my
standards have lowered this is how your
half of the show is starting by the way
yeah okay so are we screaming both to
youtube and twitch now that would that's
what the letters over here say god words
freakin letter okay hi everyone hey
twitch YouTube welcomes you to show
welcome back to awesome hardware this
episode 109 side-b if you guys missed
side a at all you can go ahead and check
it out on Paul's channel I've left the
link in the description below or you can
go to youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware
so check that out if you want to watch
it in chronological order and all that
jazz we today are gonna be talking about
some techniques you've got some
interesting articles as well as and that
goes for just tech and gaming we're
doing games report as well as to my PC
so we're gonna be taking a look at some
of the submissions that you guys have
shown us which is gonna be pretty
interesting as well so um this is a tech
tech show the poly I do every Tuesday in
fact whoa whoa slow down okay go too
fast this what do you what do you I'm
going to talk like Christopher I know
you're giving me your gift I was feeling
like this is this tension like okay fine
all right
ah I'm just saying like welcome the
launch hat later awesome hardware there
we go a tech news show that Paul and I
do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time I like check it out on
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware or our
respective YouTube channels youtube.com
slash Paul's hardware
or youtube.com / c / bit wit
it's a weird URL because i james
recently yeah because I can change you
my my URL my channel name I have I've
been having an identity crisis later
where this is spiraling down route so
quickly oh I like I like the tone I like
them yeah that your your here's
establishing alright you're right I got
this like I got this you're trying to
seduce everyone yeah everyone who's
watching this is that this is a
seduction
we got a seduced like Angelina Jolie all
right hey everyone can Jelena Jolie hey
there so um you know it kyles into on
top of yeah hell yeah on top of tech
news we'll also be giving you guys some
fresh uh but that's it it's just
techniques that's I wish I had some to
followup with that um we are selling
things on our stores in the event that
you would like to support us my store is
bit with tech slash store you can buy
hoodies shirts glasses some of the
things are sold out I'll be the first to
admit but they're they're being
restocked very shortly our t-shirt guy
just got back from his vacation or
wherever he was for a few weeks my
glasses are in stock though the glasses
are in stock they are full 20 ounce they
are much larger than these these are now
sold out but they're more of this
capacity so you'll actually be able to
fit a full pint inside of them a very
good glasses so so check that store out
and then Paul's got his store Paul's
hardware net if you buy something from
his store whether it be a polo or decal
or hoodie I let's get a you'll you'll
get some shipping discount for buying
from both of our stores quick aside here
we usually give shout outs at the end of
each half of the show to the people who
have purchased stuff on the ship on
during that half we didn't do that on my
half but we'll do that at the end of
Kyle's half yeah so sorry Danny of you
guys who we missed Johnson shout out
there were so many donations but we got
Johnson's coming at the end of this half
indeed after all the tech news dude so
uh the other thing yes
building on what Paul was saying you
guys are welcome to donate in chat it's
never required but always appreciated if
you do donate or maybe attach a little
message or a question to it we will be
reading those at the end of this half of
the show rest assured we will get around
is thank you very much in advance for
your donations um all right on that note
we can dive right in to the first
segment here I've got to switch things
up Paul instead of why are you when your
Twitter account I was gonna tweet you
have to show oh you're gonna tweet all
right well thank you very much
so instead of doing what we usually do
on the second half of the show by
starting with tech news I thought I
would kind of break up the news with a
little bit my PC to start things off all
right so we're gonna take a look at some
of your own submissions that you guys
have tweeted at me today by the country
and Paul and I are going to basically
assess and sort of give you guys any
sort of feedback and advice on how you
can maybe up the look or the aesthetic
of your system even even from a
functional standpoint if we feel like
some some hardware is a little bit
mismatched or ever will give our own two
cents no offense to Jay of course so the
first submission comes from ominous
psycho which sounds like a very stable
fellow rockin a 6700 K that's the only
tidbit of information he gave us about
this system it looks like it's in one of
those Corsair c c 400 or c for whatever
it's the included on the motherboard
layout he's got nice hairy legs he's got
some hairy ass Legos I might not like
hairy at like these are about as hairy
as my legs are yeah but your legs are
pretty hairy I've I mean intimate the
reasonable experiences reason ladies
yeah okay that's very true but I mean
he's got sort of a nice little thing
going on here
I feel like this is quintessential RGB
you've got you know some red LED fans
plus like a white LED fan at the back
but you've got green LEDs on your your
your memory cooler and then some blue
LEDs it looks like on the motherboard
perhaps some little accents here and
there so it kind of looks like a sort of
a smorgasbord of LEDs which that might
be your thing you could probably
synchronize that if you wanted to that's
totally up to you I feel like this is a
pretty well-balanced build assuming that
I mean that is a gtx 1070 which paired
with a 6700 K seems right on par for me
um cable management seems very clean as
well I don't see any sort of loose just
wires hanging out I like the end up the
inverter
is this a clear case yeah I believe that
is a corsair case that's probably the
400 seat or did see yeah because I've
got one of those lying around somewhere
that still taking up space collecting
dust but that is exactly what the
internals look like you're right
especially because you can see from the
yeah yeah there it is there's another
shot of it um yeah it's a really nice
system honestly I feel like you know you
can configure your LED strip it more
matchy match Lube first it's there then
it's not um honestly I don't really have
much to critique here I feel yeah I mean
this is a case this is a case thing but
I do like that the optical drive is up
there and in the end the little
protected area with the power supply
which means you can't see the optical
drive crappiness true that's cool
all right so mismatched LEDs other than
that it's pretty great
other than that looks pretty good yeah I
don't know what to tell you I mean like
what go all white I am he swapped these
two fans for white and swapped here your
thing here for wife you'd have kind of
blue and white and that would match a
little bit better yeah I don't know yeah
just maybe maybe stick with something a
little bit more coherence rather than
four different colors narrow it down to
three or maybe even two yeah I think
that would blend in a little bit better
I agree and you got blue on your
motherboard so blues probably gotta be
gotta be one of those colors yeah indeed
thank you very much ominous next step
we've got Patrick Patrick but the week
this is a budget build FX 6300 rx 470
and an Rx 460 no he's using this for
budget mining and tech 302 case three
Nast drives needs help he says okay
alright so honestly I can't it's it's
hard to knock you for aesthetics here at
least with your graphics cards not
matching because you are using it for a
purpose which is Bitcoin mining um but I
could say I could tell you to maybe
tighten up the cable management a little
bit I feel like some of the cables are
loosely flopping around at the bottom of
the case there and obviously you don't
have a chassis that has the best cable
routing options so you are limited in
that sense but I feel like it could be
like a bit the hard drives are perfectly
fine where they are that seems okay the
cooler is nothing special I have this
weird thing where I like my cooler to be
vertically mounted so that it's a lot
more long than it is wide that's just a
personal preference of mine if that
works for you then then so be it
stick around the power supply if we were
really talking aesthetics here could be
removed just to sort of black it out and
make it a little bit less jarring to the
rest of the overall system um but yeah I
mean apart from upgrading the overall
chassis I feel like I don't know what
else I would change yeah I mean an up an
updated case here but definitely give
you a lot more options for cable
management and would look a lot better
and you'd have potentially like a
painted interior and that kind of thing
but again working with what you've got
it doesn't look too bad at all you don't
know you don't have any ketchup and
mustard going on or anything like that
um I would say I agree with Kyle as far
as at least rotating or reconfiguring
your CPU cooler in particular your fan
on the CPU or the cable is going over
across the top that doesn't look too
great but again you have a solid side
panel so nothing you do in here is gonna
visually change all that much so I'd say
you know look into look at the case
options you've got a solid system to
work with here look in the sixty to
eighty eighty dollar range cases because
if a lot of you know like an s3 forty or
something like that
P 400 you can lips you can give yourself
an updated building experience swapping
this system into that and also give
yourself something better to work with
if you decide to upgrade your core
system I agree cool thanks sir Andrus
holidays GB thank you very much sir for
this for this price I began our five
arisin v 1600 X 370 gaming 5 16 gigs of
DDR 4 at 3000 megahertz from Coursera
s340 elite with an EVGA 500 watt and in
r9 380 graphics Cod aesthetic wise
pretty beautiful honestly it's Raymond
for some extensions yes we are looking
at maybe some
black or white extensions would be great
because the ketchup and mustard here is
not doing you any favors in the cosmetic
department is also what the s340 you
have a nice option here to bring your
cables straight up from from the power
supply basement and the daisy chain
thing going on here with your default
power supply is is what stands out most
to me that and of course to catch up on
muster cables from there so a 40-ish 250
dollar investment I think in a sleeved
cable extension for your 24 pin
absolutely 2 PCI es from the from the
graphics card yeah will give you a much
cleaner look everything else looks
beautiful yeah very solid yeah heck yeah
brah um yeah well done thank you onto
this and then next time we've got Evan
Evan and bond Evan prot rate Evan with
at NZXT source 513 azrog z7t z77 extreme
for hey 2707 gots my jam right there
4x4 16 gig sapphire nitro r9 390 dust is
life dust is love okay um well let's see
all right the first thing that stands
out to me as it does with most budget
builds or most systems in general is the
brown PCB on the other board yep I feel
like it looks like someone just pooped
in your system and just spread it all
around your motherboard that's what it
looks like it looks like big big ole
poop that's that great turd emoji right
there
um and then everything else looks fine
you have a really solid power supply
stickers upside down get rid of that
sticker just remove it he cut it off or
something yep um and then beyond that I
think your case is solid too yeah um
you're just I think I think at this
point you're you're kind of biding your
time for your next core system upgrade
because swapping that the motherboard
CPU memory getting yourself up to a ddr4
platform and everything whether it's
arisin or an Intel platform yeah I think
it'd be a great option but the good news
is like your core stuff in here like
your case power supply are looking good
like so you've got a you've got a good
foundation to build on I think yeah even
that car the r9 390 is excellent and and
as good as the 2700 K
is I feel like that's probably the most
dated thing in here so and also furthest
from an aesthetic standpoint that's
probably also the best way that you
could upgrade the look of your system is
get a new motherboard and and obviously
you have to go with a new CPU with that
too
so yeah yeah so that's what I would say
cool that's what I would say take you
heaven thanks Evan
next up we've got uh Adonai Adonai is a
Valletta thank you very much I'm sorry
for mispronouncing it's but you've got
an AMD FX 8350 a gigabyte 990 FX AUD
three hyper X ddr3 kit of 1866 four gigs
by 2n mm MSI Radeon 7850 twin frozer two
gddr5 okay um cable management comes to
mind
I guess further than that looks like
wires are just sort of just going from A
to B the the shortest way they can
without any sort of thought of cable
grommets or routing holes extensions
would do you some favours as well as
we've mentioned in the past ketchup and
mustard is not the most ideal when it
comes to tricking out the look of your
system overall I'm curious if all right
so so you've got an 8 pin like a your
supplemental CPU connector which is
routed here I mean underneath I'll be
honest if you're going to write it this
way this is the way you should do it you
passed it through that very small gap
between the graphics card and the i/o in
the back and the PCIe slot which there's
just barely enough space to fit a cable
through but like Cal said getting cable
extensions and utilizing the cable
management on this on this case because
you do have space behind the motherboard
tray here with this half case from from
Coolermaster you might not have enough
room or enough length on this cable to
get it up and around with an extension
yeah but an extension might allow you to
do that
it would also allow you to do that with
the 24 pin and then beyond that like not
to mention he's got that the shroud by
the power supply that could fit a lot of
that excess cabling yeah where you can
you know your mains F in right
if you
doesn't have much room behind the
motherboard tray yeah a good option
beyond that the cables that are sticking
out or like fan cables that kind of
thing so for that you'd probably have to
either sleeve them or buy new fans or
something like that which may or may not
be worth your while but at least I'd say
excuse me like getting some I don't know
some what's what's a what the Spray
stuff set you know talking about no no I
don't uh stuff's espresso with the spray
stuff spray paint buzz like plastic Oh
plastidip plastic this I guess it's the
word I'm like thank you Placid it might
be away a quick way of tidying up those
cables yeah that's concern for me I
could work um but thank you very much
Adonai for that submission that's gonna
conclude it for pin my PC we can move on
to some tech news here no the first of
which comes from reddit actually this is
a redditer who spotted a product page on
NCIX gum I feel like I always have to
say ncx comment Dimitri's voice NCIX dot
Colm said how he does it I neither a
partner so they yeah yeah they do the a
frequent frequent shoutouts and stuff
but there have been there's actually
been an X 299 board that's been listed
on NC XCOM that's allegedly only
supporting Katie Lake X and this would
be the first of which that we've heard
of this was the MSI X 299 m gaming Pro
carbon AC which is a micro ATX
motherboard and on the product page it
states support and I quote support 7th
gen Intel Kubelik X processors only does
it say that um go up to the top perhaps
right there yep so there's not even a
picture there's not even a picture
attached to it so it makes it a little
bit sketchy but I guess we could just
sort of discuss this in the sense that
does this make sense to have X 299
motherboards only supporting
kay be like X processors I feel like it
makes the whole launch seem a little
less confusing in the sense that if you
were to have KB like ex exclusive
motherboards you would have you you
wouldn't need to have eight DIMM slots
that's for sure you could get away with
four and we need more beer so which were
you about that getting him again white
water life so let me just let me just
let me just continue what Kyle was
saying there I am pissed off I am super
pissed off about whatever it is the cat
was talking about I was paying very
close attention and I'm very familiar
with things he was talking about they're
upsetting to me and I just want to
communicate that with you guys that me
being upset is the thing it's a result
of what Kyle was talking about and
there's there's no there's there's
there's no debate here there's nothing
to argue about
it's it's fucked up it's a fucked up
situation just gonna have to deal with
it healthy comes back with more beer
soon beers myself I had to get the beers
myself because it was already downstairs
cooking dinner
she's completely useless well is she
doing cooking dinner when she's supposed
to be getting a beer I woman hell
they're not even sandwiches okay uh yes
sir thank you all right so what we're
saying we're gonna keep you like ex
exclusive motherboards so in theory so
we're talking about if that were the
case you would have fewer traces and and
fewer PCB layers that would have to be
engineered into the board because QB
like ex you know let's be honest can't
support a lot of things that sky like X
can so it doesn't make sense to have a
single motherboard that has to support a
range of six CPUs ranging from 16 to 44
PCIe lanes I'll say this in that sense
it would be a cheaper board overall for
the end user which micro ATX or mini ITX
I don't I don't know that there's going
to be the possibility of Mini ITX with
this platform it's the same socket size
it uses the same coolers
as x99 and asrock did do a mini ITX x99
motherboard so one one board so that's
possible and it was also kind of it
wasn't there that one went to s Oh dibs
on it my did we talk about that next -
I'll figure it out later
um but point being if they were going to
make a KB Lake X only version of an X
$2.99 motherboard doing it in a smaller
form factor would at least makes some
somewhat more sense because the missing
PCI Express Lanes for connectivity from
the cable effects processor would not be
able to be used anyway because you don't
have the larboard expensive expansion
slots towards bottom I will say in my
video about KB Lake X and the X 299
platform and talking about what happens
with different motherboards when you
plug in that 16-lane processor that's
one thing that always happened that
bottom most PCI Express explained
expansion slot it's pretty much is
always gone I just didn't function
anymore so smaller board you don't need
that slot anyway and then maybe that
makes more sense yeah and the thing I've
been considering is if you wanted to
make right now even with the advent of
thread Ripper the fastest gaming system
possible you'd probably look at you
probably do it on kb like x true so true
and and and and here's the other thing
is like while while a micro ATX version
of a kb like x exclusive x to 99
motherboard would make more sense than
what's currently available I still feel
like overall that still makes less sense
than just having cable x kb like exon z
to 70 because because at the other day
even if you're able to reduce the price
of an x 299 board to the price of a z an
entry-level z 270 board that would
support kb like x you're still losing
out on the eye GPU in a sense so I just
I just don't see why there is a need to
migrate to a completely new platform I
feel like this is a processor KT like X
is a processor family that should be
eligible to just upgrade from a-z 270
platform if you have a 7700 K you should
just be able to take that out and swap
it swap in a KB like X chip there should
be no need to swap out the motherboard
as well it should have been a double
socket it should have been it should
have been at that would have been epic
AF so if you look at like the like
gamers Nexus for example Steve and
friends have a deal itting you have a
deleted you have a deleted 77 40 X I do
so did you look at the PCB the PCB of
the chip yeah it's a double PCB is it
yeah there's the wider PCB that's the
same size as all of the LGA 2066 CPUs
uh-huh and then there's a secondary
substrate that's above it that sits on
top of that you're talking about
underneath the IHS yeah under that HS no
no mine was already sort of melded
together so I didn't want to like take
it apart or anything like that
oh so yours was deleted but you didn't
you never actually separated it correct
it was given to me already deleted and
put back on so I never got to see the
actual die underneath oh it's just you
know well if you if you watch the gamers
Texas video that's one of the things
that they talk about what's the fact
that there's this weird situation where
you have a PCB for the for the LGA 2066
and then you have what looks like a
smaller PCB that's kind of integrated up
on top of that for the KB Lake X CPUs so
obviously this isn't the thing and
everything but what like how crazy would
it be if that if you could just pop that
off you know and it was somehow socketed
in there and it was just a 7700 k yeah
you know and then you can take any 7700
like pop it in that little adapter and
then slot it into 20 66 that'd be fun
that would be so much more practical
yeah and like oh then you have an
upgrade path like you know grab your
7700 KZ 270 system right now and then
you know in a few months when X 299
board prices come down grab one of those
you get the little adapter pop in here
7700 an upgrade path all the way right
Wow Intel could have had such a
different reaction to this entire
platform
if they had homely somehow figured out
how to do that which is probably
entirely impossible yep with the Z
height and everything modulus DP use but
that would be yeah loose exhausting sure
yeah yeah um at any rate finish the end
of the day you know the the feedback on
this launch has been overall very mixed
you guys can let us know what you think
about it in chat I believe we just got
our core i9 samples from Intel yes today
so this is obviously a full 24 hours
plus after the NDA has lifted and I
personally feel about you Paul I feel
like the pressure to you know create
content around the CPU after long after
the NBA has lifted has sort of
diminished to a degree I
I see it as a challenge yeah make
content that's a little bit more
different and perhaps unique yeah than
just a standard review yeah so like for
instance if I gotten the 7900 X a week
ago I would have run benchmarks on it
and I would have done a video that was a
pretty standard benchmark video which we
saw a good amount of with 7900 X and
even people at 7800 X's in 1720 X's
yesterday there were plenty of excellent
reviews from an antic yep I read PC PC
perspective sure gamers Nexus Haggard
had very excellent reviews testing lots
of different softwares in lots of
different situations yeah and like the
avx-512 stuff and all that kind of stuff
but I got quite a few comments on my
video because I I wasn't able to do that
kind of review because of time and when
I got the processor and everything but I
was like I was kind of forced to do so
as I car I need to do something that's a
little different a bit of a different
take on this and I should think it kind
of worked out well because people like
you know a lot of times there's these
embargo lifts a lot of the tech
reviewers I'll post kind of the same
contents mm-hmm whereas now like some of
the stuff's a little bit makhmour mixed
up so um the same reason why I was kind
of excited that I was given a deal ended
chip because I knew it would be
something a little bit different than
what most reviewers would have and I
feel like you know based on like the
feedback
and stuff that people were interested to
see what what keep you like xD lighted
could do especially because you know it
is known for the higher I PC than the
core i9 sky like X area yeah um so that
was kind of cool but yeah I totally know
what you mean and I think I think your
video turned out really well honestly
thank you it was a nice refreshing
launch video so if you guys if any guys
watched my video and here at all
interested in the behind the scenes
stuff my video I was intending cuz like
I did I shot the stuff for that video I
sent it over to my editor Joe on Sunday
morning and then I had some Father's Day
stuff to do Sunday afternoon and evening
and then I came back and he had the edit
done and I took it and then yesterday I
spent like another 8 hours on the video
basically because I was like I need to
make this more accessible for people so
I did a bunch of graphics and like you
know like little arrows that pop up at
things you know just like that kind of
thing like all those little things every
little element like that like takes a
bit of time so I spent a lot of time on
that to try to make it as accessible for
people as possible so if you guys
haven't checked it out please do and
yeah the feedback has been really good
so awesome thanks to all you guys who
have been saying good things about that
and sharing it and everything for sure
alright so I guess on that note we can
move on to our next story which is about
future mark announcing their test driver
benchmark automation software yeah this
is probably more exciting news for
reviewers like me and Paul or perhaps
you know people who are like analysts or
you know hardware companies and things
like that this is basically an article
first off from tech power up so thank
you guys automation software for
reviewers that is going to let users
script and automate your own selection
of benchmark so while there are no
built-in benchmarks that are part of
this suite itself it is a is going to
allow us to script any any sort of
automated benchmarks that we want to run
with this program so that's pretty cool
future mark is offering email support to
customers for integrating benchmarks
with the app though this is this is a
huge thing for potentially for me and
Paul and another review
was like us because benchmarking takes a
lot of time um it's it's I mean at the
like I guess it's a big picture of
things like you could just boil it down
to just clicking some settings you know
tuning some settings and hitting run but
if you could because you could actually
as a if you're reviewing something and
you've run benchmarks before it's like I
know the next five benchmarks I'm going
to run I know the settings I'm going to
set them to right and it's like if I can
have software that automatically
recognizes when one is done and queues
up the next one and records the
information and everything and does that
work of me then I can move on to doing
other stuff like getting footage of the
product I'm talking about or testing
something else because this is the main
problem with benchmarking for me when
you're benchmarking for a big launch or
something like that it's the fact that
you have to keep an eye on it regularly
so you can set something to auto run or
whatever like let's say it's Metro last
light it has a nice built in benchmark
you can set it to run but as soon as
it's done after that 2 or 3 minute phase
you have to set it to go again for the
next resolution that you want to test
that and then you have to switch that to
your next game let's say it's GTA 5 you
constantly have to babysit your your
benchmark system with an automated
software like this if you could just
script all of that it would save a
tremendous amount of time and you could
actually go about filming let's say a 10
15 minute video without any sort of
interruptions and still get all of your
benchmarking done at the same time which
would be a tremendous time savings for
for the average reviewer so something
like this is very something to get
excited about I feel like if you are
here yourself or you just are you know
have a reason to test your PC hardware
this is pretty cool again future mark is
offering email email support to
customers right off the bat
who need help integrating the benchmarks
with the app it's also one of the things
that um so so there's there's lots of
well-known established trusted review
websites out there and there's quite a
few of them that WCF tech it's not who I
was referring to oh but there's quite a
few of them that have
some level of automation that they've
developed kind of home-brewed right into
their testing and that they're very
secretive about which I don't know how
to do that if I if I did I would sure as
hell wouldn't share with you
well I'd save it court it to myself I
mean anytime you can look at a review
and you can see like a just the lists
and lists of benchmarks they have with a
bunch of different processors and a
bunch of different configurations and
everything time goes into to creating
all those numbers and anything that can
be done to reduce the amount of time
that goes into those numbers is
extremely helpful for anyone who's a
full time reviewer indeed so again I
agree next up we've got an article about
the Microsoft Surface laptop which
recently received a zero out of ten
that's a great score for repairability
this is an article from overclocked 3d
net iFixit the very popular sort of a
you know deconstructed a company gave it
a 0 out of 10 for repairability calling
it not a laptop but a glue filled
monstrosity glue filled monstrous which
I would imagine means you cannot really
take it apart it's kind of glued
together um if you were to service or
maintenance it in anyway you probably
have to take it to a Microsoft expert
which seems very Apple ask IMO even
iFixit experts according to the article
we're unable to dissect the device
without inflicting major damage that's
not great and they even claimed the
battery is dangerous to replace
dangerous dangerous to replace because
you could puncture something there might
be some lithium-ion gas that the leaks
out and and and you know impregnates you
or something that's how it works right
so the other thing is that the CPU
memory and on-board storage are all non
replaceable this is not a very Pro
consumer product in terms of servicing
and upgrade ability um
I fix it went on to say that this is not
a fix it yourself device
it forces users well they didn't say
this but the article went on to say that
the sort of forces users to get the
longest warranty possible in case they
ever need the laptop serviced or
replaced so that kind of sucks I mean I
feel like usually like if I go to like a
store or even like buy something on
Amazon like a like a device like this
and ask me do you want the extended
warranty I always say no oh yeah because
I'm like I can just fix it myself I I
have no problem doing it myself I don't
need someone else to tale this for me
but if I were buying this device I feel
like I would be sort of more or less
pressured into buying into the extended
warranty just knowing that I could not
just take a screwdriver to the dome and
crack it open myself without doing some
serious damage to the system so I always
say no to the extended warranty for a
different reason
um because because warranty because you
know you're gonna void it anyway
cuz I used to work at Newegg and I know
how much pure profit is off of
warranties is in those extended
warranties yeah well warranties are
never for because you're likely gonna
use it it's for like the people who are
scared and it's for the small percentage
of people right yeah I need it but they
not gonna apply to you much but the
extended warranties are mostly pure
profit for anyone who sells them of
course you know you know the margins on
them and that makes it makes it a bit
more skeptical to buy into them
absolutely so um I don't know just
beware if you're gonna buy a Microsoft
Surface laptop then and hey if if
Microsoft catches any flack for this for
the fact that they built their surface
laptop essentially like a MacBook with
everything glued together and so many
upgradability and or anything like that
every shred of it then maybe the next
time around they'll take some more
consideration to providing some
expandability or something like that who
knows maybe maybe not or maybe it's just
really challenging to build something
that that's that small and light and
everything without just gluing all the
shit together now you can totally go
ahead yeah they're lazy being late
alright next article is about a web host
that has agreed recently
to pay 1 million dollars after being hit
by a line mix of white x6 Wow but after
I will said Linus
Linus ransomware by olymic targeting
ransomware little Isis targeting
ransomware
would be a the latest way that Linus
meteor group is making tons of money I
believe their Twitter accounts been
hacked before so that was a witness Oh -
a line is targeting resuture soon cuz
reducing so this article comes from Ars
Technica thank you very much folks over
there this is about a South Korean web
host naina
probably some relation to nyan cat they
said that their initial ransom was
nearly 4.5 million dollars but the
company negotiators brought it down and
eventually settled for just over 1
million dollars paid to a ransomware
operation that encrypted the data stored
on 153 Linux servers and 3400 customer
websites so you see you're like you know
let's say you're like GoDaddy or
something and you basically get hacked
or you get stuck with this ransomware
where 3400 of your customers are now
complaining and out of a website and
can't log on or whatever can't service
their own users and so you end up paying
1 million dollars to get all of that
encryption handled that's that's a lot
of money 1 million dollars to some
scumbag attackers is pretty insane the
ransomware itself for those of you
curious to know how you could get a
million dollars in the future is a rebus
Erebus Erebus Erebus paul you're better
at pronouncing things than I am
you nervous e re B us I'm gonna say
Erebus Erebus was previously limited to
attacking windows-based systems but was
recently modified modified to infiltrate
those running Linux as well so it's
possible that the attackers also
exploited a back door or a vulnerability
into the web hosting services loosely
patched software so apparently the South
Korean web host wasn't all that solid to
begin with in terms of its you know
backdoor prevention things like that the
quest
here is I I was thinking about this
earlier like after reading this article
would you pay off a ransomware attacker
or an operation if they hijacked some
sort of digital property that was deemed
important to you such as maybe your
YouTube channel they were holding it
hostage
you know people couldn't view your
content or whatever and they were
demanding a ransom and they guaranteed
you promise and let's say you knew that
they were good with their word that if
you pay them the allotted amount that
they would restore your channel back to
normal would you pay up which would you
would you honor the ransom or would you
I hold back and sort of you know say Fu
I think it's important to distinguish
the difference here between something
like ransomware
and something like a YouTube channel
being taken over something like that if
they were yeah if they were to take over
to my youtube channel that would be
something like you know they would need
to get the my passwords or something
like that they would need to be
basically be able to take control of my
channel by by accessing the accounts
that control that channel sure
ransomware is something more like
there's been an infiltration on these
servers all of the data that's in there
has been encrypted the data is now
encrypted and you need the encryption
key in order to decrypt it so you can
access the information that's being
stored right so what I would say is in
this situation where it's something like
my channel is being compromised or
something like that I can't say exactly
how I'd respond to that but I would at
least in theory have some expectation
that YouTube has some backups in place
there's been plenty of situations in the
past where channels have been taken over
and the hacker goes in and deletes all
the videos or something like that but
then you to be able to go in and restore
everything so in that situation I might
be more inclined to say you know what
I'm not going to work with these hackers
I'm not going to pay them any money
because based on everything I am
confident enough that I can get in touch
with YouTube and they can work through
the situation to restore my channel yeah
in this situation you have a business
that's specifically providing Internet
they're providing web hosting for lots
of other companies that work for them
and all of the data that those companies
have provided to the web hosting company
has now been encrypted and has now
locked
unless it's unless they do something
about it so this situation it's a web
hosting company that has negotiated with
the hackers to cut the 4.5 million
dollar ransom down to 1 million dollars
to get something that the hackers get
paid the company gets their information
back the employer that the the merge the
customers of that company get their
information back and they can they can
restore their services and continue to
provide them with the services that
assume presumably those third-party
companies are paying a you know some
kind of fee to that company for right so
in this case obviously the hackers are
shitty and like you know shouldn't be
ransoming stuff but everyone kind of
gets paid and that kind of distributing
to the point where like they can
continue doing business obviously it's
going to hurt their bottom line but it's
I think it's a slightly different
situation than some individual who gets
their their contents or you know who
gets a virus on their computer something
like that it's as encryption on
everything so you're saying if they
hijack your YouTube channel you wouldn't
pay them off because YouTube can
technically have the backups to restore
your channel back to normal whereas if
you were a web hosting service like this
one that we're talking about then you're
kind of more on your own and you'd be
more subject to no I well I think in
this situation the web hosting service
made a business decision yeah they were
like look it's going to cost us this
much money to get our data back or it's
going to cost us this much money because
all of the all the companies that are
doing business with us are going to go
elsewhere because suddenly their web
sites don't work anymore but doesn't
that also send a message to other
operations that you are willing to pay
up if people are just able to encrypt
your data like that's why we don't
negotiate with terrorists as Americans
because then it seems like they have a
grip over us and some degree there's
love
Ridge there that you've now established
saying I'll pay up whatever you asked
for maybe you'll be negotiated but the
other day you'll get something out of
attacking me I think you or I coming
from a separate not having money
invested in this situation we have any
chance can say that because yes like if
the if the hackers never get money then
theoretically the hackers will stop
doing the stuff because they're not
profiting from it true but from the
business perspective of this company
they probably did what was in their best
interest as a business and theoretically
if they're talking about this amount of
money that's being transferred back or
one way or the other to get their data
back they're going through channels
they're in some way secure there's have
some assurance of getting the money back
so yeah obviously it's not an ideal
situation sure but what I would say
anyone who is looking at this story
should take into consideration is that
whereas Windows has for quite a while
bin the playground of hacking and
viruses and everything because it's the
most used operating system by the most
individuals who are the least likely to
have proper protections in place for
viruses and malware and that kind of
thing yep to understand and appreciate
that there is a realm of hacking beyond
that that does influence Linux and that
does potentially influence Apple
platforms and that's they're not exempt
from that and they need they need to be
careful and they need to put the proper
protections in place as well it's very
thorough answer yeah that's the most I
can say about that I wholeheartedly
agree with you Paul okay um but I think
that's probably about as much time you
spend on that for now so let's go ahead
and move on to our last article with the
tech news for today which is about the
Supreme Court's striking down near North
Carolina law prohibiting sex offenders
from using social media saying that it's
unconstitutional so Justice Kennedy just
good old Justice Kennedy said and I
quote a fundamental principle of fur
amendment of the First Amendment is that
all persons have access to places where
they can speak and listen and then after
reflection speak and listen once more of
course adding the digital spacing
including Facebook and Twitter are also
protected under the First Amendment so
the case in question that was centered
around this whole thing was centered
around a sex offender okay just just
imagine sex offender all right we all
know what that looks like
who was prosecuted after making a
Facebook post about beating a not a
child a traffic ticket
he made a post about beating a traffic
ticket saying thank God I can't believe
I got out of the traffic ticket what
good luck I have that was it there was
nothing about like you know touching
little kids or any any sort of weird
sexual activity thing like it was just
use just a regular Facebook post but yet
he was prosecuted for making that
statement online and so based on the
court sort of a statistics here
apparently over 1,000 people in North
Carolina have been prosecuted for
violating the law
whether it's you know you're posting a
picture of your kid or you're saying
just you know oh I feel I feel great
today on Facebook or Twitter you can get
fined in North Carolina but mister
Kennedy Justice Kennedy was like no no
I'm gonna drop some more wisdom on you
and he went on to say by prohibiting sex
offenders from using those websites
North Carolina with one broad-stroke
bars access to what for many are the
principal sources for knowing current
events checking ads for employment
speaking and listening in the modern
public square and otherwise exploring
the vast realms of human thought and
knowledge I feel like I feel like
Kennedy knows what's going on here
Justice Kennedy here um so I mean at the
other day even if you're a heinous sex
offender social media has gotten to the
point now with with the breath of the
Internet and just how common
is I feel like it's just it's just it's
the same as talking in a way right it's
just the ability to express yourself on
a completely different platform whether
it be talking to a person than in real
life or someone on the phone or through
the Internet
I mean we're not gonna ban sex offenders
from speaking in public or from calling
their friends on the telly so I feel you
know I think I think me and the judge
share the same mentality where it's like
well you know social media is just
another platform for communication you
shouldn't like BAM you should ban them
from playgrounds okay
banned them from playgrounds maybe but
not from Instagram necessarily unless
they're posting you know dick pics to
teenagers that's a different story then
but for the most part I I feel like I
sort of stand by this stand by this
ruling um it is possible however that
there are specific websites like those
aimed at young people like it's you know
teen flesh com all right what that I
don't even know if that's a website I
don't know why where that URL came from
should probably uh I hope it's Elvis not
hey what if that's an actual like a
horrible horrible website that people
know everyone's would be like okay let's
just people now think that you're like a
regular patient of or something like
that
that's awful okay I don't know why I
said that but um anyway I don't know why
we're discussing this is this story in
general everyone this oh this is this is
such a there's so many potholes with
discussion and I self in them I was like
Mowbray they should they should block
people from free speech ah yeah you're
not gonna have anyone arguing with that
like Oh sex offenders should be able to
have more freedoms yeah no one's gonna
argue with that either I'm noticing
though this is a horrible thing to scat
has already turned against me calling me
a pedo right I'm not a pedo good lord
this is I'm simply reporting on a dick
signatory requires like some subtle
nuance
does it like discussion details that I
feel like we're completely incapable of
providing right now let's just get the
hashtag piles of pedo and chat yes get
that trending on Twitter ASAP tweet my
wife she'll be so thrilled to hear that
I've been a part of this movement she's
not watching the show no I highly doubt
it and for good reason but she'll
probably find it eventually anyway
hashtag causa pedo I've never been more
proud um let's move on to our next let's
move on to our next segment which is the
games report hey gamez yay let's talk
about video games where pedophilia is
not even anywhere near the conversation
that sounds good I love this topic great
let's let's talk about first off Hitman
being available for free yeah the
loophole they're only the beginning of
hitman just play the beginning of hitman
for free not the entirety of hitman so
I'm I'll interactive by the way this
comes from overclocked 3d net thank you
very much for the article thank you for
people who have already clipped the teen
flesh comp segment love you stash growth
d3 beautiful alright so IO Interactive
which is the developer for this game has
announced that they're making the
opening of hitman 2016 free-to-play for
gamers on all platforms PC you know Xbox
one ps4 and all those other inferior
platforms giving them access to the
games
I see a facility missions with no
strings attached so you don't have to
buy into anything you can just play some
of the fee Olivia the first two missions
I believe of the game completely free is
sort of a promo offering it includes two
story missions to escalation contracts
and overall the 40 challenge missions
which you keep you entertained for a
while the free downloadable version
launches today IO Interactive has also
stated that they are going to reduce the
cost of the game with a 60% discount for
a limited time also if you were sort of
on the fence about picking up the new
the newest hitman game might now might
be the chance to do it and that now
might be the time
take advantage then stop hash tagging
cows with PETA alright uh yeah hit man
um I used it for benchmarking I'm sure
Paul does too once in a while not for a
while but not for a while but I usually
take care the Hitman metric yeah yeah
hit mehit mans fun you can hide bodies
and dumpsters and all that sort of thing
next up we've got Diablo to a potential
remaster might be happening this is an
article from PC gamer PC games n spotted
a job listing for classic games in
Irvine California for the UI and UX
visual designer look at look at how
Diablo 2 used to look like yeah look at
that yeah it looks like shit it looks
like total ass I can't I want to go
plate like like my butthole
all these skeletons go to them developed
a better than might have dropped a
legendary though any of those skeletons
could drop a legendary and it would
still look like shit you should keep
killing those skeletons until one of
them drops the legendary always killed
skill and then if the RNG on these specs
on the legendary don't fall wait no see
I'm getting confused now oh there was
well there was a point in time with the
legendaries like there was there was
random specs and then there were fixed
specs I don't know I played the elbow to
like twice first I we ever played Diablo
2 at first three months I played like
and it was all I did like that was my
entire life was Diablo 3 or Diablo 2 I
was like 3 months 3 months all I did was
Diablo 2 and then it's like oh god ok
I'm I'm wiped out like I've awakened out
I'm like I'm a fine I'm fine
and then like five or six months went by
where I didn't play at all and then like
something happened I sigh gosh maybe
I'll try that again and then like two
more months went by that's like Oh God
and all I've done is played Diablo 2 for
two solid months is ruining my life like
my education has gone to shit like I
dropped out of school I was very like
for UFC I'm lucky of no nice to have
have been in college when Diablo 2 was
not a technique it's very so I feel like
that's probably the make-or-break
whether or not you graduate from college
is based on when Diablo 2 launched
during that period
you look like this the juggernaut the
the the enemies that would spawn and
they have he's like a demon yes
extra strong he's extra fast and then
he's Krueger dagger Coeur de Groote
Krita gonna go murder burgle whatever
they're nothing is credibly there were
there random enemies that could spawn
like if they had that yes they had the
wrong combination of immunities that you
couldn't touch right we're just be like
did they destroy you cuz like anything
you did healed them because like oh I
have like I cast fire spells like oh
they absorb fire and heals them there's
nothing I can do
like I gonna die just whip them with my
whip hair but it was challenging and
that's why a lot of people were in her
into it yeah
I feeI feel like diablo ii definitely
made waves that diablo 3 did not and I
feel like since Diablo 3 was so highly
anticipated following a legendary title
that it just sort of fell fell short of
the mark of what be a blow to instilled
in PC gamers back in the day because you
have to remember Diablo 2 launched in
2000 whereas Diablo 3 was 12 years later
in 2012 so there was a lot of hype being
built up for for a sequel and when it
finally dropped when Diablo 3 finally
dropped it didn't quite have the same
magical effect on its users that the
catalog censor did the cowl levels while
the Cal levels legendary I also I also
had the problem of like like there was
this economy like right if you played
World of Warcraft you know starting in
2005 up through you know now or whatever
World of Warcraft has an economy like a
lot of the World of Warcraft economy and
I think how they sort of tried to craft
that was based around certain things
that just developed naturally from the
Diablo 2 economy like India blow to the
default item that you would use as the
basic level of trade was a stone of
Jordan which was a unique ring that
would fall and somehow people would
collect enough of them that they could
like trade them back and forth and I
remember just trying to trying to play
enough of the game
and gather enough loot and and you know
scrape it all together and enough pile
that I could trade it to stuff just that
I could get one stone of Jordan like to
that point and then people are like oh
like 40 stones of Jordan for this like
thing or whatever I'm like what it's
great you know yeah likes ridiculous or
whatever so anyways the old-school
crypto girls sounds a gorge we should we
should do some storms of stones of
Jordan crypto mining yeah that would be
a great crypto currency like I'm a name
for a crypto currency stones Georgian
have yes just mine 20 stones of Jordan
recently have a soon so just get some
etherium bullshit yeah alright let's
move on to our next time this is gonna
be the last time we talk about you can
ignore the other tabs that are in there
because we're cutting enough okay have
we were fitting in time here but users
are mad users guys are so mad super bad
so mad about mods being taken away in
GTA 5 rightfully so this is an article
from GameSpot commenting on rockstars
parent company take two who has shut
down popping the popular modding tool
open for or open IV which is leaving
many gamers to lash out with negative
reviews and petitions so modding as we
all know and GTA 5 is a huge thing
people mod in GTA 5 whether it be
upgrades or modifications to the car
mechanics the vehicle mechanics in the
game the weapon mechanics being able to
play as The Incredible Hulk and jump
around and scale buildings or be
spider-man or whatever the heck it is
modding has been a huge huge community
it's been a huge community in GTA 5 in
the last year or two but that has all
been sort of shut down in a sense with
open four which is a huge modding tool a
huge modding software being shut down by
take-two parent company of rock star
look at the recent recent review yes so
theme are overwhelmingly negative yes so
of the 42,000 user reviews written in
the last 30 days only 13% have been
positive label
the gate labeling the game's average
user feedback rating on Steam as
overwhelmingly negative this is a game
that has sold over 80 million copies
that was overwhelmingly positive before
this whole ordeal but just the fact that
they've that take-two is taken away mods
and gone out of their way to eliminate
the modding community for this game has
resulted in a complete backlash across
the board when it comes to how the games
being received so the top review
according to this article states the top
review simply states on behalf of the
open for Team asterisk asterisk asterisk
asterisk you with hearts in place of the
asterisks I would imagine there's a
not-so-pleasant word in place of those
cards say priming fuck you they probably
mean fuck you yeah thank you for stating
the obvious now now that's been edited
now to include a link that that leads to
a petition on change.org which requests
Rockstar allow the continuation of open
for claiming all modding used by open
for is for single-player use only to
make the game more enjoyable the
software open for was never used to mod
multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto online
so it doesn't harm anyone now this is a
claim that Rockstar disputes saying that
open for enables recent malicious mods
that that allow harassment of players
and interfere with the GTA 5 online
experience for everybody so so here's
the deal Rockstar doesn't really seem to
care whether or not you use mods for
single-player it's their other GTA 5
online that they care about because
that's how they make their money that
makes sense and then they make their
money by people of spending real IRL
dough for GTA 5 bucks so that they can
buy a yacht or a Maserati or whatever
the hell but if people are modding in
online use that they're potentially just
giving money away I mean I remember
being in a server once in GTA 5 online
completely unbeknownst to me some guy
just ran up to me and just
like dropping like he was like he did
some like weird voodoo thing
music okay walk around walk around like
move around like start walking and I
started walking and everywhere I walk
just money would fall out of my butt and
I'd like come around and like go around
and pick it up I was like basically
eating my own money poop that's nice and
I was like this is weird but I love
money so I'm gonna do it and so I guess
that's what rock star is really trying
to combat here but obviously the
backlash has been tremendous and so
already the petition here has already
signed 55,000 signatures of its 75k goal
but in the grand scheme of things that's
still a very small fraction when you
consider the total user base of GTA 5
selling over 80 million copies it's hard
to believe that this sort of petition
will really change take twos mind on how
they're going to better protect the
integrity of GTA 5 online so ultimately
you guys like I understand them trying
to protect their online environment not
only do they have a vested interest in
making sure that people can't use hacks
or other software workarounds to get
themselves money rather than paying
rockstar for the in-game money but also
they have a vested interest in making
sure that the online experience remains
at least relatively fair for people and
then people can't use hacks or anything
like that to gain an advantage over
other players that they might have
otherwise had to spend you know tons of
tons of times in game to you know get
those resources of that kind of thing at
the same time though like with with PC
gaming like the modding community is
huge like that's one of the one of the
big reasons why PC gaming is so awesome
is because there's so many games that
have come out that have had some base
level of functionality or base level of
gameplay that people have enjoyed so
much that they've gone and taken
whatever open-source tools are made
available by the game developers to
actually take that game and bring it to
new heights by developing new versions
of it or whatever like look at something
like dota or likely like League of
Legends like none of that would have
existed if it wasn't for blizzards
making the modding tools for the first
Starcraft and for our World of Warcraft
available for people to create a
completely new different style of game
yeah um that hadn't existed before I
think that's one of the things that
makes the PC platform unique is the
ability to create modifications in games
and sort of breathe new life into the
game I feel like if I were a developer
that it would almost be like flattery to
me that people were modifying my game
and you know kind of adding like
contributing to it I feel like that's
exactly what I would want for a video
game I would personally develop but I
guess when you're on the scale of
Rockstar intake to where you are simply
just in it for the money and you're
trying to profit 100% off of it through
in-game transactions then something like
mods put poses a potential threat I feel
like if there were if there were zero
mods that affected the monetary gain of
users that we probably wouldn't be
seeing this sort of um sort of excess I
don't mind I think they would take
action unless it was affecting their
Plus it was hurting their bottom line
yeah but it would be it would be good to
see some sort of in-between like I'd
love to see Rockstar develop their
software whatever whatever tools they
currently have in place to prevent
people who have modified software from
affecting their game especially when it
comes to the online situation yeah I'd
like to see them develop that further to
create more of a separation between the
single-player and the multiplayer
environment so multiplayer can still
exist and Rockstar can still make their
money but single-player can still have a
full like like flourishing modding
community as well yeah like I'd like I'd
like to see that that kind of best of
both worlds and that's that's like sort
of the shitty thing about this is that
it's the few it's the very few modders
in the community who are giving like
money away in online that are ruining it
for the rest of us who jus just want
like nice texture packs in GTA 5 like
what's what's the harm in having better
graphics and have having better visual
fidelity in your
and your single-player campaign yeah
absolutely nothing but because some
asshole decided to give 5 trillion
dollars to some dude on an online server
somewhere none of us can have access to
that so it is it is just like sort of
the typical you know herd mentality or
like you know just how society is one
person ruins the whole bunch for the
rest of us and it's kind of unfortunate
and I totally empathize with all the
negative reviews that are going around
to Rockstar right now but I don't know
all I can say is stay strong hopefully
hopefully we can you know that this
doesn't dishearten the modding community
in the long run and that we can still
see some really awesome mods for other
games moving forward and potentially
even GTA 6 when that debut is one day so
on that note though um that's going to
close it out for tech news and games
reports let's go ahead and read off some
of the donations that you guys have left
in chat this is your last chance to
donate if you want something stupid
that's read aloud by me and Paul go
ahead and donate in chat right now
otherwise forever hold your peace the
first of which is from Nana boo garlic
or Abba jarvik I'm not sure exactly how
I pronounce that it's four five canadian
and it's just five canadian there's no
message attached thank you very much not
and I appreciate that Andrew a meal for
the five dollars what is a budget gaming
monitor family man on a budget so I
would say budget is probably under 250
I'm sorry
150 I'd say under under 150 um look I
don't have anything in specific best
1080 IPS maybe a 27-inch yeah around 27
inch 1080 IPS if you can get higher
refresh rate than 60 Hertz look for it
if you can get better color reproduction
than 8-bit 8-bit will be your what is
seventeen point six million colors 10
bit will be your one point zero seven
billion colors yeah but yeah see if you
can find a 10 bit IPS 1080 panel for 150
H dollars yeah that's what I would say
under 180 you can get a really solid
monitor for the specs that post
and definitely if you have an AMD card
or if you have a tree shaker is
impossible every sink with an AMD and
look for G sink with Nvidia you're not
going to get a budget juicing panel that
probably won't be able to find a budget
G sink panel but it's definitely worth
your while to look for the adaptive
frame rate technology indeed Daniel
Collins $5 already have a gtx 1070 so do
i sli or gtx 1080i build is a i7 6800
okay four point three gigahertz
saber-tooth xx 99 and so forth um I
would say go for the gtx 980ti yeah
especially if you can sell your 1070 and
put some of that money that you've you
got probably widget a $450 plus for your
1070 right now invest that in a 1080i
and you'll be very happy yeah I think
that would probably even outperform the
1070 SLI in most of the applications
desk Jones and Dolan did you see all the
OSI 3d review on the 78 20x EP review
Hyo seeded to 5 gigahertz with very low
voltage but it became a toaster who
equals Intel failed toothpaste shit
instead of soldered uh yeah there's
definitely been plenty of deleting going
on of the KP like X and C I like X
processors and in fact when I was at
Computex that's what durbar showed me
was just his stack of deleted cpus and
definitely that's something that can be
swapped out to give you yourself a
better overclocking experience yeah it's
still too early to say just a blanket
statement like don't do that or yes you
need to do that or anything like that
right um but yeah and that does seem to
be an issue for 7900 X in particular
seems to be running warm a lot of the
reviews I read said that that we're
getting pretty hot with that CPU right
and anything that can be done to reduce
that is going to be on the table I think
for people especially enthusiasts yeah
and if the lighting is one of those
things then so be it
honestly with like devours deleting tool
how simple it works after testing out
the 77 40 X that I had which was deleted
like the temperature reduction is insane
but it's
crazy that demo said the living tool
that he at least when he gave me is so
he's working on the one for the for the
LG at 2066 socket but when it comes to
the higher core count CPUs the high core
count CPUs 12 14 16 and 18 cores those
actually have a much larger die that's
in there and what he said was when
you're trying to deal it those there's
so little room between the heat spreader
on top and the die that's underneath you
have really limited amount of room to
like push it to the side and that's what
his deleting tool does it applies
pressure to the side of the heat
spreader on top to move it enough to
break the seal between those I mean it
could damage it since they're so little
yes so what he's saying is this music
slide it might squeeze me really really
really challenging or it's potentially
going to be really really challenging
for the hike or count X 299 Intel
processors to actually deal it or to
actually delete delayed reliably because
any movement to that heat spreader on
top is going to either conflict with the
die itself or it's going to conflict
with other surface mount components that
are on top of the PCB interesting but
all that story means to be seen since
those high core count CPUs are still
kind of like like don't really exist out
there by montabaur get on it yep
give us a good sky like XD litter next
up automatic match for the $5 donations
thank you very much Matt Matt for your
patronage
no Kyle I never quite and also horas
boards don't have that hoodie I've been
after one since PAX East that was mostly
a coherent sentence Moton I'm still kind
of confused but I'm glad you got a
hoodie from PAX East I'm assuming that's
what that means yeah absolutely I thank
you very much Matt next we got Tom's
brems dissed brim it's bream bream
Smiths for the 15 Norwegian Corona
Corona
I love Kronos this time I missed pin my
PC because I didn't have pics on my
phone on phone finish with with finish
build also 980ti is enough for the x34
monitor by the way beer to the bottom
which I mean
I would imagine means drink it all have
to pee yes okay me too um yeah a gtx
980ti would be enough for next 34
monitor fish it I'm I think that's good
you could do better you could of course
authority idea is sufficient yeah I mean
34 40 by 1440 is a lot less taxing than
4k so I feel like while 980 I was not a
4k ready card like many vendors Adam
board partners advertised it to be I
feel like it's a sufficient you know
ultra wide um thank you at the very low
you'll be fine but yes you could do a
little bit better with the 1080 or 1080
TI yeah definitely 1080 Luis Herrera $5
how do I explain computer building
skills to meet women um find a woman who
loves building pcs uh let me know in 35
years when that happens yeah as it will
probably take you around that long pic
you have to get pretty lucky I don't
know yeah I don't I don't I don't know
look at the male to female viewership
ratio there's a discussion on Twitter
going on about this earlier today from
everyone from from mkbhd down but yeah
like mine's like 2% I have two percent
female I'm probably room it's like if
you're like we're all four you're lucky
to get up to five percent and so mkbhd
is at five I think it is at six maybe
some wow what a play uh those are the
ladies straight up player just a bunch
of chicks but yeah tell me about that
smartphone it's totally what he does let
me see that frisbee golf move this is
exactly what what Marquez sounds like no
no that's what the women watch mothers
women so impersonating the women I'm
sorry I didn't I didn't know who come on
I mean the impression of obby it was
mommy so you know it was obvious I was
on point with that impersonations all
right Dez Jones five dollars getting
tired of waiting for the new EVGA cases
and the gtx 1080i hall of fame from
Daleks are you as well um GALEX I feel
like does not prioritize the u.s. and
their launches yeah I feel like a lot of
their stuff launches overseas first and
then it comes to the u.s. assuming that
you are from the US I feel like a lot of
the the samples that I've received from
Galax I've had to purchase myself from
like a Taiwanese or a Chinese website
and wait quite a while for it for it to
get to me the ones that are available in
the US should arrive a bit sooner but
that's just the price you pay for super
clean looking white GPUs am i right I
mean they're the best in the biz if
you're looking for a white colored GPU
galaxy's is second to none in that sense
as far as the EVGA cases I honestly
can't help you there I have no idea
what's up with those it keeps showing
them to us they keep showing up to us
and they assure us that they're coming
soon but we don't have any more
information on exactly when they're
dropping so um but best of luck to
finding all the things that you love in
life
thank you des Ryan fuss about $50.00
hold of Jesus thank you thank you very
much right now looking to change cases
from a Corsair 600 CE to something nicer
and you recommend a good ok showcase for
showcases and quotations for an x 99
Strix
6900 k2 GTX 10 80s in a custom loop with
a 1 with a 360 red and a 240 red based
on what is out now we're might be coming
soon hard to see cases in person where I
am so a good showcase for something like
that ok obviously I feel like this the
600 C that you're working with right now
is perhaps a bit limited um if you
wanted to go boss the wall and do it J
style you could go with like a case labs
chassis which are extremely expensive
but I feel like that's the case that you
could have for life regardless of
different iterations that you make to
your your overall system over the years
case labs would be able to support you
on that the cases are just incredibly
spacious and well thought-out um and
also great for doing any sort of
modifications as well if you wanted just
something a bit more more more common
maybe a little bit more cost-effective
than that then I would say jeez let's
say you've got a 1 a 360 in there and
240 I believe and through evolved ATX
could support that don't quote me on
that um but that is one of my favorite
cases till this day the silver build
that I did in there couple months back
was absolutely fantastic um I don't know
I always think of I always default to
fantex cases when I think
some water cooling just because they're
they're so well thought out as far as
like the reservoir and pump support and
radiator support obviously there are a
lot of good cases out though right now
that that have excellent radiator
housing um see ya I don't know um check
out Corsair Corsair obviously has some
good stuff there 780 is a fantastic
chassis for something like that
the 780 has 360 ready or support but the
780 t of course here 780 TS 360 rad
support on the top or the bottom a B or
no gravel um I believe the the fractal
design defined s has 360 at the top with
240 at the front so you could look into
that as well but I'm sure other people
and the chat have some suggestions for
you there DD a forty x-men a $20
donation thank you very much sir ROG
Maximus extreme edition 10 plus an i7
6050 CPU with 40 PCIe lanes is the
thousand dollars or asus prime x 299
deluxe plus an i-9 7900 x 44 pci lanes
equals $1500 I'm thinking cheaper don't
reward Intel for I nine to buckle
honestly I think your thousand dollar
option seems a bit more price to
performance oriented unless you're doing
some serious heavy duty workstation
stuff I think the 6850 is going to be
absolutely fine for your needs
ROG Maximus extreme is going to be a
fantastic board as well go with go with
$1,000 option save save your money for
some other important things does Joan
like a quick follow-up to the previous
question the 780 T supports dual 360
Reds Oh
raise the roof all right so I was
partially right about that does Jones
for the five bucks at that moment when
you realize you're still running
Zizi 87 chipset and a GTX 780 classy
that's never been OCD like it should or
water-cooled Oh feels bad mad 780 assign
a 780 classified it's not by mom well it
already comes factory overclocked yeah
but you can always you can push it more
okay could get precision X you can
overclock your 70 you classified
thanks des des because any setting you
probably overclock your ship as well
Sebastian Cosette laughs or the ours
50/50 ours we Argentinian Argentinians
something rattlesnakes starting at
starting 1150 build should I go for the
i-5 7600 K or the i7 7700 K main use for
gaming and Adobe suite I have this aces
easy to 7tf Strix motherboard and a gtx
1070 Strix i would go for the hyper
threaded chip go with the i7 7700 k
because if you are using the Adobe suite
it is going to benefit from
multi-threaded applications and hyper
clothing does come in handy when you're
talking about video editing for example
which I would imagine you're doing in
Adobe Suites
overall the i7 77k would be my best bet
is it is an Argentinian peso and 50
Argentinian pesos is 3 dollars and 10
cents US well beautiful
alright I will accept that donation
Caleb Parker for thanks and that was us
thanks for breaking up thanks Caleb
thanks for bringing up the work week
have you thought about selling awesome
hardware merch as well also do you guys
have any non tech related hobbies
excluding copious beer consumption yes
we have been thinking about selling
awesome hardware merch we're not even
working on that right now but actually
so actually actually actually sweetie
and I have no idea if Brian is watching
right now but the right before John went
on vacation I sent an email with the
beginnings of the first steps of the pre
early prior to anything happening to
getting some awesome hardware
potentially merge merge oh wow it sounds
like we're really I don't want to make
any promises or anything like that but
but our branding Brian Brian egg aka
America Merrick's
marek so motox Alexa I don't know how to
pronounce his name
he has sent us several shirts and and
and
one of the board's the the cornhole the
cornhole boards yeah with really good
artwork that he's done of us and
everything and we make great shirts so
hopefully we'll have some of that stuff
up soon
yeah as far as other non tech related
hobbies non tech related hobbies I don't
know but I I try to only drink copious
amounts of beers on Tuesday I will point
that out yeah for me it's like Tuesday
in the weekend and maybe like there's
like fries like for instance this has
been in my fridge all week I didn't
drink it is a my fridge all me too I
didn't drink it both of us were very
responsible cuz I've just been super
smoking crack and stairs all the crack
it's hard to crack crack my anti-truth
hard to drink the beer when you're high
on crack cracks my anti-drug listen
Scott alright thank you very much
Sebastian can I'm sorry Caleb um
humongous again for the five British
pounds vapenation if so have you tried
nasty juices green apple Oh green a
behave also some vape go nicely with
beer and enhance the experience yes sir
I still a vape occasionally um I've been
vaping more recently ever since I got my
my unit up and working again
but some that I do all the time I look
into your your recommendation naturally
pretty much always looking for new
suggestions there Anthony go forever
Anthony I think Anthony also got that
same last name like Luke does like Luke
Leviathan eager for FFF uh who's our
buddy and good pal from tweak town go
ahead and check them out uh with five
Aussies five also you Dollaz I love you
guys going to get a beer to join yeah
that's what Anthony sounds like what
time is it
in Australia it's probably like you know
drunk thirty because they're also you
bastards I thank you very much Anthony
and he's you'll appreciate we love you
it's like early afternoon we think of
you fondly here one thirty one thirty
seven PM one in the waiting two sevens
where you are in Australia it's anywhere
from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. sandwich
eating the sandwich having lunch or
maybe wrestling right that was like oh
god what a solid it was start drinking
yeah I guess absolutely
thank you very much Anthony wasted space
for the tendon British pounds rare I
catch lie
a youtuber streamer and running 5820k 32
gigs 1080i custom water-cooled set up
with 840 pros in H 440 the deals balance
but will I actually see much from the
new core increases core increases Adobe
based the new core increases is he
talking about sky like X perhaps alright
so 20k which is one 86 Couric's core six
core 12 thread parts going outside if
you were to Mexico something I'd say
you're looking pretty good right now and
with what you have right now you're
totally fun and functional what you're
looking at potentially for the future is
eight core and above CPUs because those
will outperform your six core especially
when it comes to like rendering out a
video or something like that that said
for a 20k streaming up you're not going
to get too much better gaming
performance out of that other than
dropping down to like the the mainstream
Intel platform and going really high
frequency 77 under K or something like
that
so I'd say for right now you're totally
good I wouldn't worry too much about
your configuration give it six months
plus for like the Intel stuff that's
just launched so sure to play out and
settle down a little bit for the thread
Ripper stuff to play out and settle down
a little bit I'm getting any rash
decisions
yeah I'd say maybe maybe consider an
upgrade like around the holiday time
this year but all the sales are going on
and if you can get a good deal but
honestly even at that point you're
probably still going to be good with
your six score and your 10 atti it's
probably gonna be a while before that
needs we're gonna feel slowed down grade
yeah but if you're enthused and
enthusiasts and he really like computers
you know I've never been anyone to say
like you don't upgrade like that yeah it
would suck like if you're really into it
like the good thing is that your 32 gig
kit will still be good for upgrading to
sky like X yep um ddr4 you don't you
really only have to swap out the the
board and CPUs that you have that going
for you but thank you very much wasted
space for the donation we do appreciate
it
next we've got Mad Mike mourn for the 5
bucks haha finally made it on live
cheers to beers I'm drinking you un-lame
youngling black and tan lean o Yingling
you
Ling is uh I think that's from Texas
maybe not familiar maybe I have yet
you've never had a jingling before I
don't think so I think it's from Texas
but I could be completely wrong um let's
see brews expense jingling jingling his
son oldest operating Brewing Company in
the United States
Pennsylvania established in 1829 one of
the largest Brewers by volume in the
country based on volume sold in 2016
yeah I remember getting drunk on yiling
you jingling at an airport once ha the
first and only time I've had it that's
interesting because I'm not familiar
with though yeah it was it was tasty it
was very clean and crisp it's not too
heavy it's like sort of a I don't know
if I'd call it a pilsner but yeah good
beer well we're glad that you're you're
drinking that the Black and Tans sounds
delicious thank you very much med Mike's
but Mike next we've got Faro barn Hearst
for the $10 donation great show guys
thanks for all the info you are very
very welcome totally look the Beast of
the dark $10 donation upgrading to a
1080i with the intent to water cool in a
full loop should I go with a cheaper
card since I'm replacing the cooler
anyway or aim for higher end for a
chance at better Bend chip slash
overclocked I think a 1080i is perfectly
fine yeah I'd go with the lower end card
the amount you have to spend for the
bend chips is just like 200 bucks more
and it's really not worth it for the
minor improvement you get with clock
speed unless you're trying to break a
world record yeah I mean if unless
you're a hardcore overclocker unless
you're going to be going in and editing
V bios's to increase the amount of
voltage you can provided the GPU just
stick with a basic like like a basic
founders Edition design you can get for
a good a good price because you're
overclocking with that will be just the
same as on just about any of the Adhan
board cards except the very highest end
and like I said those aren't as aren't
worth the money deep all right so we've
got Fred ranch Fred ran from a dollar
donation I will donate $100 if Kyle's
wife comes up smacks him up the back
side of his head for dogging her about
dinner
well Heather Hey I think she's
downstairs and probably can't hear us so
that's probably not gonna have us right
there a second ago
really hey come here why is just Kyle is
now actively hey come hit me in the head
me in the frigging face it means up
there she can either sign
so whatever then uh we'll miss out on $7
so hopefully that always still goes for
next week
thank you there friend thanks Fred uh
keep that in mind Xavier meds Gert for
the $5 rise in 1704 gigahertz I can only
get to 2800 with all four sticks in do
you think it would be worth running 16
gigabytes at 3,000 or stick with 32 at
2,800 love you guys I'm assuming you
need the 32 if you need the 32 32 32 32
honestly if you didn't yeah even going
from 2800 to 3000 megahertz is probably
only be like at most 5% of a difference
you're probably not going to notice it I
would value the capacity overall instead
of the actual frequency in the afraid I
generally would too but if you're not
using if you're not using above 16 gigs
if you can test just keep an eye if
you're running graphics or if you're
running a bit if you're doing video
editing or anything like that anything
that might use higher memory wait I
think I hear my wife hi there
test it smack me in the face come here
and smack me just smack me in the face
just just no contest Heather Heather
just to point this out a $100 donation
has been offered if Kyle's wife comes up
smacks him in the back side of his head
for dogging her about dinner all you
have to do
smack Kyle in the back of the head ow
there was alright and now we wait that's
all and now we wait okay well hurry up
we're almost done also it's it's dinner
time that was a legitimate smack we're a
little bit late today okay all right
that's Fred
we're ready so yeah yeah hopefully
Xavier that makes sense you bet yeah go
with the capacity if you're using it if
you're not using the capacity go for the
memory
you can see sure wasted space ten pound
donation and a second one because I owe
you some adblock money without demanding
an answer to some more arbitrary
question love the content and the combo
keep being awesome and you totally won
scrap your doors fuck scrap sure we
agree totally agree with hashtag Rob's
in space never forget
thank you very much wasted Marc headsman
for the five dollars is it worth putting
in I 778 20 X into eight and X 19 X 299
motherboard or should I say for the I
970 900 X which xq 9 board should I go
with if the X the I nine or the i7 I
would say yes d78 20x is probably one of
the most desirable CPUs on that platform
right now because it's $600 your limited
28 PCI Express Lanes but a lot of people
aren't going to use that much unless
they really have like if you don't have
4 960 Pro SSDs and a threeway GPU
configuration you're probably still
going to be ok with 28 PCI Express Lanes
there is something to be said some
critique of Intel for cutting down then
he actually paid $500 Thank You Fred
that's painful Fred's the best he's got
that smack in this follow through you're
a stand-up guy oh yeah 78 20x actually I
looked this morning's the 78 20x on new
egg was the first one to sell out so I
think that's the one that most people
are interested in and probably the one
that's going to be the most practical
because it's four hundred bucks less
than one you have to pay for the 70 100
which you have to pay for to get your 44
PCI Express Lanes in 10 cores but 8
cores X 600 bucks is still pretty good
for the 78 20x and I'm actually slightly
disappointed that I didn't pre-order one
myself hmm I didn't like I've got a set
of 900 though so so that's ok yeah I
think I think we're good yeah wasted
space from the 10 British pounds and a
second one because I owe you some
adblock you anyways you're peeing near
to your - oh God okay Obama my chicken a
lot of Canadian which one of you is
sitting on the crappy staples chair
neither of us we're sitting on crappy
Target chairs crappy target Cheers
flippin Fred $5 drink in my PC would you
consider spotlighting some actual
pimped-out regs in between just to show
what they would be like we have done
some like like notable mentions
honorable mentions and stuff and ones
where you bring them anything like
there's nothing we can say about this
one but yet wanted to show you guys stay
tuned for maybe another week where we'll
just do a bunch of like glamorous rigs
that are better than ours that could
almost be like a different segments yeah
like a like a like awesome setups or
something like that yeah absolutely cool
thank you very much though make fun
pants for the $5 hey gang I have an i5
6600 K and a GTX 1060 I want it to game
and stream to youtube and twitch should
I just upgrade the GPU or do a full new
build with Rison so if you're gonna
stream
I would suggest Reisen because you're
gonna get more cores and more threads
and and you're not going to be spending
an army you're going to be paying an arm
a leg for that
it's very priced performance I would say
risin 5 honestly unless you really have
some higher demands so getting maybe
like an art r5 1600 I don't I feel like
a resin 5 wouldn't be a huge upgrade
from a 6600 K really yeah because the
6600 K has better instruct instructions
per clock than resin Flavin or gaming
yeah resin I've still only has four
cores but for the stream in a system and
eight threads so you do have more
threads make fun pants here's what I
would suggest you do you you have a 6600
K that has an eye GPU that has quick
sync
I would say try to test out some
configurations with OBS and or xsplit
whatever you're trying for streaming
that uses quick sync the capabilities of
that 6600 K you might lose a slight
little bit of visual quality with the
stream that you put out there but it'll
have a much less a much more much less
of an impact on your actual gaming
performance for the graphics card since
you have an Nvidia graphics card you
also have the Nvidia quick encoder
option as well so I play around with
both of those just to see if you can get
a nice balance between the GPUs the
performance that you have and the
screaming that you have and the quality
that you have
because right now you have a pretty good
configuration
and switching over to rise in or or even
like that the the extra 99 or something
like that I feel it could be a little
bit more of a side grade for you right
now versus just trying to figure out the
best configuration for what you have and
where you're using a better graphics
card might help your situation out a
little bit more so 1070 or 1080 but of
course those are really hard to get
reasonable prices for those right now so
that makes it a little bit harder but
yeah
for the very least though if you're
gonna be streaming rising this is
definitely a good option um a bub gun 45
$5 donation do you think I should
continue with my i-5 2500 K at 4.2
gigahertz for the near future or get a
new CPU um I don't know I feel like it
depends on what games you're playing
right now I feel like the 500k if you're
if you're overclocking 24.2 is still
pretty good you'd probably get I don't
know a 10 to 15% game if you were to
upgrade to something like the latest
like 7700 K for example or 7600 K I
guess if we're going the i-5 route um so
I also know depends on your GPU as well
yeah
but an overclocked 2500 k is still
perfectly viable right now yeah it is my
wife is still gaming on a 2600 K which
is overclocked to four point three
gigahertz so not much more than that it
does have hyper threading but it doesn't
really affect the gaming performance
that she experiences very much and she's
still getting favorable frames and games
like h1z1 overwatch occasionally when
she place it so I don't know I feel like
it just it also depends on how much
money you have at your disposal how much
disposable income you have um if you
upgrade your CPU obviously you're gonna
have to upgrade your motherboard as well
possibly your memory if you're going to
go for a ddr4 platform then you're
looking at a serious overhaul upwards to
four or five hundred dollars at the very
least so um bear that in mind if you
upgrade one of those things you're gonna
have to upgrade several but I think 2500
K is pretty solid for now Shane $5.00
building a twitch streaming gaming PC I
had a 7700 K picked and a GTX 1080p I
should i mix the 7-6 77 hundred K and go
with an 1800 I believe he means X or one
of the X
series processors from Intel yes yeah if
you're streaming go with a high-end
Rison or go with x-series if you're
planning on gaming and streaming at the
same time you're going to want more
cores and beyond the four core options
that are available in Intel's mainstream
platform right now and rezian has proven
to be a very good solution in that
situation ends the FPS that you lose a
little bit at the top end with that you
get with a 77 3 K is made up for by the
fact that the rise in CPU can keep up
especially if you're doing CPU encoding
with streaming and gaming at the same
time okay we're gonna speed through the
rest of these because we're super short
on time red red red bands 2 hours yes I
will make the offer again next week and
Frederick and view head Ranch
drop the hundred bucks just as promised
yeah as money for hitting Cal in the
back of the head I mean it's amazing
what can be done when feedback
if mystically abuse me like I would I'm
not gonna assume that every time I hit
you in the back of the head
I'm gonna get a hundred bucks because if
I were to assume that I'm a little
terrified for your next time shock at
the headlock kind of scared for the next
time we scream well welcome we're live
please sooner just take even with me me
me me baby donations live for next week
and see how lucrative actually turns out
