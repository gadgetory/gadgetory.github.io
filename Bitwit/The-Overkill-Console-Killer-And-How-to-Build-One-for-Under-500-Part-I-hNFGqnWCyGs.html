what's up guys so today I am pretty darn
excited because I finally get to build a
particular PC that's been on my mind for
the last few weeks it all started when I
posted a picture of the Lian Li P Co 5
on Instagram and several of you
suggested I use it for a console
replacement build so four weeks later
I've gathered all the parts to make it
happen just for you and kind of for me
naturally the name console killer
immediately comes to mind a term used to
describe a PC that outperforms today's
gaming consoles for around the same
price and while the system I'm building
today will indubitably outperform a ps4
or Xbox one in most cases hopefully
building in a chassis as extravagant as
the PCO 5 will forcibly push me far past
the price point of either console I
guess this makes it more of an overkill
console killer or a console / killer so
as I go over the components for the
build I'll also be discussing ways to
bring costs down for those of you
looking for a more conventional approach
to building a console killer I should
also note that this is a two-part series
so in this video I'll just be assembling
the system and I'll be conducting the
actual performance benchmarks in part 2
so with that said our first piece of
hardware on the table is the AMD athlon
x4 860 K it's really no surprise I'm
going team red for this build
considering we're trying to keep costs
to a minimum but that doesn't
necessarily mean we're skimping out on
performance this m2 processor offers
outstanding price to performance in the
sub $100 price range and it's 4 cores
will be ready to handle the increasing
number of games that take advantage of
multiple cores holding everything
together is the f2 a 88 X and Wi-Fi from
gigabyte this was the most affordable FM
2 plus motherboard I could find with
console esque features like built-in
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi additionally it's
got Gigabit Ethernet LAN front panel USB
and a dual BIOS making it a great
addition to our arsenal for system
memory I've chosen a 2 by 4 gig 1333
speed kit from G skills sniper series G
skills really never let me down when it
comes to offering reliable modules at
prices typically lower than the
competition and having eight gigs of RAM
aboard the system will be more than
enough for even today's most demanding
PC titles doing the bulk of heavy
lifting for our games is the power color
r9 280 this rebranded 7950 from AMD
packs a three gig frame buffer on a 384
bit bus while giving us a good amount of
overclocking Headroom to really push our
frame rate considering the ps4 and Xbox
one support 1.8 and 1.3 teraflops of
compute performance respectively the r9
280 s 3.3 teraflops is a big step
towards building a bonafide console
killer and at just 160 bucks after
mail-in rebate this card from power
color is nothing short of a steal
cooling our f1 cpu is the shadow rock LP
from be quiet it's quiet
slim and sexy lucious I was so impressed
by its performance during the recent
review I did of it that I just had to
use it for this build though my
insistence on its inclusion might lead
to high clearance issues with the glass
panel on the pc o5 if push comes to
shove I do have a slim fan lying around
that will make the cooler fit at the
cost of some performance mind you for
those of you operating within a console
budget I'd suggest using the stock
cooler that came with your CPU yeah
it'll be noisy and it won't offer much
overclocking Headroom but it is one of
the easiest spots to cut corners here
and it'll make for a most welcome
upgrade in the future our operating
system will live on this 240 gig SSD now
v300 from kingston tossing an SSD in the
mix gives us all-around faster
performance when launching games and
booting into the OS though it's honestly
more of a luxury item when building a
console killer on budget to shave costs
down I'd recommend sticking with a
single reliable hard drive like this
Seagate Barracuda I'm using this 2
terabyte model that I pulled from an old
external hard drive enclosure but if you
don't have a spare mechanical lying
around you can certainly find cheaper
drives than the Barracuda now rarely
ever is the most expensive component in
your system the case but I suppose you
should expect nothing less from the
borderline art piece that is the PCO 5
from Leon Lee high quality aluminium and
glass construction make up a striking
contemporary enclosure that will
probably be the best looking piece of
hardware in your house but not without a
hefty premium clearly this is another
area where you can really cut down on
costs with the cheaper case so assuming
you aren't building in a high-end wall
mountable chassis by the way I do plan
on wall mounting this sucker I would
suggest going with something like the
cooler Master Elite 120 advanced which
you can pick up for just a fraction of
the
cost another caveat of the PCO five is
that it lacks support for an ATX power
supply drastically reducing our options
to sfx units so here we have the
silverstone s FX series 500 watt fully
modular power supply so yes this is
another component I admittedly splurged
on however this also means yet another
opportunity to save some cash assuming
we were building in something like the
elite 120 which supports full sized ATX
units there's a handful of solid options
in the sub $60 price range to suit your
needs and power requirements for a bill
such as this one that being said this
unit's 80 plus gold rating semi fanless
design and flat black modular cables
make this one of the nicest power
supplies in its class and finally just
to add some icing on the cake I'll be
lining the case with a few of these led
alchemy strips from BitFenix accent
lighting isn't really something you
consider when building on a budget but
given the circumstances of that
beautiful tempered-glass panel on the
PCO 5 I felt it would be a sin not to
embellish just a little so altogether
the total cost of my console over killer
build came out to be just south of a
cool grant nine hundred and seventy two
dollars and twenty one cents to be exact
not exactly a favorable number for those
on a console budget however if we make
all the affer mentioned revisions to the
parts list we can bring the total cost
down to just under five hundred dollars
without affecting much of our overall
gaming performance since we'd still be
keeping our CPU motherboard memory and
graphics card making this a much more
compelling offer as a console
alternative so now that all the hardware
fixings are said and done the next
logical question here is how well does
this system perform but in order to
answer that will first need to build the
actual system this has been Captain
Obvious signing off
all right so the build turned out pretty
great it looks beautiful but as you can
probably tell from the footage not
everything went according to plan so
first off you can see right here that
the ATX power supply cable was not long
enough to route behind the motherboard
tray just because of the unique layout
of the PC o-5 I actually ended up having
to route it just right above right in
front of the RAM
you can also probably tell that I had
ended up having to use the stock AMD
cooler which is pretty expected I
suppose because the shadow rock LP was
too tall to fit in here with that
tempered glass side panel but so let me
show you what I did I took the fan off
and I replaced it with this slim size
fan with the some zip ties it looks kind
of a kind of janky but when you're
looking at it from the perspective of
the way it'll be mounted into the case
you can't really tell it's not too bad
but even with the height clearance
issues solved I was still running into
issues with the RAM clearance because I
just underestimated how tall the heat
spreaders on the sniper modules are and
I can't really get the cooler down onto
the CPU without the heatsink scraping up
against the top of the heat spreaders
there so I could just replace the
heatsink with with a shorter one or with
one that has more clearance for the RAM
but then I'd probably run into the high
clearance issues again with a glass
panel so I think the better option here
the only option really is to replace the
sniper modules which I'm kind of bummed
about because I really like them in here
but I do have some low profile RAM in
the stream box system over there which I
could probably swap out put the RAM
modules in there and then and then do a
little switcheroo and it should be okay
but I'm going to save all those upgrades
and those little updates to the rig for
part 2 which is also the video where I
do the benchmark so all together a
fantastic looking rig so far a couple
quirks here and there but overall pretty
nice so there you guys have it I know I
am pretty gosh darn excited to see this
thing in action but as always I'm
curious to hear from you guys as well so
let me know in the comments what you
think of this overkill console killer
and also your thoughts on the sub five
hundred dollar version that we noted
earlier do you think it's enough to take
on a current gen console I think so but
either way stay tuned for part two where
I put this rig to the ultimate test
you'll also get to see the completed
system mounted on my wall before I go
