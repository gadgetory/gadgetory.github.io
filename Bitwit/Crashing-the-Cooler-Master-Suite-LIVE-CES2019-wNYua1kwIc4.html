2019 I don't know why I'm saying welcome
I don't like owned the place or anything
but hey I'm actually streaming live oh
Jesus Christmas I forgot to mute and
we're already off to a great start
I always mute the video player that you
that you have open before your screen
starts if you can tell this is a great
this is a great indicator of how things
are gonna go I did it again there it is
all right we are so on top of things
right now what's going on guys hope
you're all doing well it's CES week
things are crazy I've been having a
blast so far and there's a lot of cool
tech that we're checking out this stream
is sponsored by Cooler Master I'm
actually at their suite right now in the
palms palms plays very swanky and we're
going to talk about some of their
products today have some fun do some
giveaways we actually have some awesome
prizes to give away for three guys and
maybe did a little bit of a little bit
of gaming action at the end there so
how's everything Gump coming in loud and
clear do you see me do you hear me let's
see it bizarre hello I don't have
millions people yelling at me so that's
good sounds good awesome I'm really glad
things sound good because we didn't have
time to test audio so that's good
obviously things look great because
Chris actually set up everything he is a
film god is a very difficult job making
me look good
alright let's see you guys are doing
good I mean you're fresh YouTube Chet
because they're not coming in at all
there you are there you are okay cool
sweet so thanks again to Coolermaster
for sponsoring this video
the stream so first time I've ever done
a stream like this at CES and depending
on how bad I messed this up I might do
it again next year you guys let me know
wifey sauce is also in chat you shout
out to her and she's gonna be taking
your questions and copy pasting them
into a Google Doc that I have so I'll be
answering some of your questions perhaps
with the cooler master rep towards the
end of the stream once we go over the
products if you guys have any questions
just post them in chat if Microsoft sees
that you're you're not trolling and you
actually have a decent question and
be able to get answered let's see what
else we got here
it sounds slightly muffled okay people
are saying it's somewhat muffled some
people are saying it's okay good voice
maybe here let me try something really
quick guys give me a second input device
oh I think I might know why you know the
webcam is completely muted so it should
just be picking up through the LOB all
right
caution headphone users I'm going to tap
my lavalier mic just to make sure it's
coming in all right you guys hear that
how's it sound
I'll get on the twitch side so twitch is
saying that I sound perfectly fine so
this could very well be a YouTube thing
and we switch if we're coming in loud
and clear on Twitch then you guys are
more than welcome to hop over to the
dark side and meet me in twitch chat
where things might sound a little bit
crisper but we're gonna push it on here
and we're gonna start off with some
product coverage now obviously we're a
little bit tethered here streaming from
this is the setup so we can't have all
the products right here on on set but I
have gone in and we've taken some video
clips of some of the new products that
Coolermaster showing off today so we're
gonna take a look at some of those
starting with the NR 400 the switches
over that they're that awesome b-roll no
Chris the the NR 400 come in at 59 bucks
it looks it looks a lot nicer than a $59
case I will say look at that front panel
pure mesh it's a very fine mesh material
I'm very easy to dust off as well so you
get a ton of airflow at the front I'm
actually really liking the way this case
is looking so far beautiful
tempered-glass side panel those black
frames all around you can see it's a lot
of full-size hardware as well it's a
micro ATX case but you're not really
sacrificing much functionality what do
you guys think of it I think it looks
really nice
you can see you also have radiator
support for I believe 240 or 280 it
looks like looks like you've got dual
mounting strips there depending on your
needs a lot of a lot of mesh material
there on the top as well you get 2 USB 3
power and audio jacks up there as well I
don't know I think it's looking really
good it's kind of got this sort of sleek
modern design you can see me there
taking off the tempered glass side panel
with captive thumb screws thank you very
much I got some beautiful hardware in
here as well I'm really diggin that
hyper 212 RGB Black Edition I think
they've really done a good job updating
and modernizing what has been like one
of the best price to performance air
coolers the market has seen so it looks
pretty great in here I also like that
right angle 24 pin ATX connector that's
just that's that's super clutch as well
my basement obviously so you get dual
chamber just enough direct airflow clean
up through the the cable management a
bit
speaking of cable management those
rubber grommets rubber grommets in a $59
case is always nice to see definitely a
lot better than those cutouts and that's
the NR 400 people you guys let me know
what you think again feel free to ask
any questions YP sauce will be checking
up on that let's move on to the next
case so if NR 400 is not rich enough for
your blood they also have the NR 600
which is kind of like the bigger brother
fully check support look at that
you still get that awesome mesh at the
front so tons of tons of airflow being
able to permeate very easily know what
looks to be three individual addressable
RGB fans is actually one product that's
that's a single unit all those fans you
can see are connected under one housing
and this makes sense for obvious reasons
I mean it's less fuss especially because
there's only two cables coming off of
this entire thing to drive all three
fans so you can see those two cables
right there going into that cutout it's
just such a much cleaner solution here
that's one of the biggest problems I
have with RGB is not just the fact that
it's on everything but that it's a pain
in the ass to wire up all the time when
you have so many different connected
devices also saves you many ports on
your motherboard addressable RGB headers
and stuff like that okay
cooler there air cooler looks a lot like
the rapier it's actually there m61 at 6
110 M 86 110 M looks a lot like that
rate Ripper will heat sink design 120
millimeter fan in between that that's
the NL 600 you guys check which one do
you like better I don't know I'm kind of
you know me you don't you know me like
I'm I'm a small form-factor guy but not
where it counts
I really like the NR 400 I think it just
looks really clean they look great but
that's that's personally in my style
we've got another system yeah let's show
you let's show you this one this one's
really good that's the same one
there we go this is the Q 500 P now this
is the only system or the only chassis I
should say here that is an actual
prototype so you guys feel free to voice
your opinions comments questions
concerns right there I think I think it
looks great it's got a roomy interior I
believe its micro ATX yeah it looks like
micro ATX and look at that front panel
they're actually still deciding on what
kind of material to use for the front
panel they have a really nice fabric
panel almost looks like them but you'll
go on the front here which is actually
really good for air flow even though you
can't see diddly squat in terms of
ventilation holes so the rear i/o is
mount on the bottom here as part of the
glass panel you rewind that a bit just
so you can take another look I'm talking
too slow apparently but the where is it
at where you at there you are
so you can actually rotate this this is
tempered glass side panel any direction
to change where the ports are so you can
have a very flexible orientation of Io
of course it's always gonna be on the
left side and we've got those two nice
handles pretty rugged handles at the top
of the case if you want to carry this
around for land events and stuff like
that so yeah you guys let me know what
you think let's see do you do alright so
the mic looks like it's still having
issues alright let's take a look here
output device thank you guys for always
being so honest so so brutally honest it
looks like we're still using the
lavalier no no this isn't even the specs
not even enabled let me do a little
check yeah
guys is your left or right ear love link
right now is it only coming in on one
channel because we don't like that we
want both yours to have equal
opportunity yeah it looks like it's in
stereo so there is a way to make it mono
you can just you can temporarily stop
yeah we're good we're gonna cut audio
really quick guys so you only have to
look at my beautiful face in silence for
a minute so just go ahead and let me
actually see it Chris I might be able to
take a look at it
according setting left here's way louder
let's see give me a second
you guys need to look at this look at
this I'm coming back here for some
reason can be got knocked in was and was
frozen guys just just take a look is it
is it okay so it can be is temporarily
down I'm sorry you guys missed that but
don't be too upset I still have this cam
I can show you guys it's we got me two
huge beer buckets with lime and just
glasses on ice thank you guys Thank You
Jamie and Stacey and Coolermaster love
you thank you
I would love yep please please choose me
what if I try it through all right now
audio is coming through the actual
webcam which is an ideal but if I don't
sound like a robot anymore hey people
people like the audio now I think we did
a good thing guys we did good oh wait
hold on hold on special quick quick
cameo who's that everyone first person
who named that that guy whoo that
strange-looking man wins my heart you
always do
you just know me so well have a beer go
there I'm offering it's on me
oh you already got obviously I can't
even look okay
all right guys what's up adios good
let's continue good lord
hmm all right um let's see should we do
a giveaway let's do a giveaway on a
product that we're actually going to
take a look at so this is their SK line
these are the wireless Bluetooth
keyboards these are awesome
this is the SK six to one I believe look
at how cute look at how tiny see if I
could switch the camera to a better
angle oh please
I'm seeing the actual HUD of the of the
camera at least at least we can verify
that the shot is straight all right I'm
gonna check alright so I actually like
these keyboards funny enough I actually
decided to bring their their existing
USB see line the wired line from home
it's low profile genuine Cherry MX low
profile red switches they feel really
nice super tactile this is actually one
of the nicer looking low profile boards
I've seen with genuine Cherry MX which
is chiclet style keys that's your thing
fully compatible with obviously Windows
systems as well as Mac and Android so
cross-platform if you know you're
sharing this keyboard with someone on
inferior platform than Windows no
Windows has its fair share of problems
we're not gonna get into that right now
but it's beautiful keyboard obviously
RGB let's see if I can actually tune
something here well you guys you guys
know what RGB looks like don't you look
it's changing colors magic so I really
like these keyboards you can also use
them wired however so it's very flexible
additionally 14 hours of battery life
with the RGB on obviously your mileage
will will go a lot further if you don't
care about the LEDs or if you have them
at
brightness so a lot of options here
again it's the XK 61 and I would like to
give it to one of you for waiting so
patiently and for during all my audio
what about wifey sauce is calling me
what's that not this size ok wifey sauce
wants to go bigger probably because
she's married to me so we're actually
gonna give away a slightly larger
keyboard which is pretty much the same
in a sensitive all the features are more
or less the same but it's got more keys
so obviously it's not it's not fully ten
key number pad or anything okay
clarification you'll be receiving almost
this exact same keyboard but it'll be
the wired version because these aren't
quite ready yet but I really like the
wired version again that's the one that
I have right now so this is good it's
good looks like B cam is also good take
a look alright so same same pretty much
design as the the last one I showed you
but the SK 631 adds a couple more keys
it's a bit more functionality built in
and we're gonna give it away so I have
here in my Google Doc the username the
name of one of you in chat Wi-Fi sauce
has randomly picked one of you for me to
announce rat me out
alright and in just a second it'll pop
up on my Google Doc in just a second any
minute now
all right oh I was like that's your name
all right the winner of this keyboard is
mr. Isaac Martinez Martinez come up to
the front of stage you can't because
you're you're in chat but we're gonna be
reaching out to you very shortly and
getting one of these skx 631 units over
to you stat I'm slightly jealous
I would like to did I mentioned these
also come in white what yeah this is
actually something that you'd probably
find an Apple store but actually they're
selling this at the Apple store at some
point I believe very very
design-oriented there and for all of you
higher-end users who want that 10 key
number pad they also have the ASX six
five one
voila this is a big boy this is the big
boy all right if you're an accountant
and you like low profile switches this
might be a keyboard for you these are
also pretty fun to game on
I don't mind gaming on these quite as
much as I thought I would
so very nice keyboards again Bluetooth
and type-c available and yeah those are
those were their new keyboards coming
out very soon I just love how slim they
are you can honestly put them in a
backpack no problem mechanical keyboards
even like the 10 keyless ones little
candy style regular switchboards are a
little bit a little bit more difficult
to tote around in your bag that's for
sure but we have we have yet another
awesome case that we'd like to show off
here cool a master suite which I don't
know if we need to get this beer out of
the very good or oh yeah but you just
put it on here so I'll smooth these
wiping sauce would put generously like
to help destroy the beer eliminate the
beer problem by drinking all of it save
me save me like five Oh in the meantime
we've got a pretty nice system here
mainly because as you can see has my
damn logo on it and being the narcissist
that I am not have asked for more
what a pleasant surprise here at the
school of master suite although I do
believe that they also did this for
gamers Nexus and Paul so maybe it
devalues it a little bit but I still
appreciate the thought it looks very
nice this is their Q 500 L and this is
not a prototype this looks like it's a
retail version very nice
ATX chassis so this builds off of the
the Q 500 see what was at the Q 300 I
believe and it's actually it's actually
a full HDX tower that ATX case obviously
a smaller form factor case but it's
actually got a really small footprint
it's designed to be more compact lovely
dust filters I love the simplicity here
and the fact that they managed to make
dust filters look like an integrated
part of the case design I think that's
actually probably a harder thing that
looks like you got these tempered glass
thumb screws again with the same blue
these are captive that's that's nifty I
like captive thumb screws on the
tempered glass
why haven't I seen this before are you
guys seeing this are you guys seeing
this this is this is innovation okay
obviously this is how you're gonna have
the same sort of design and inside or a
slightly different design should say is
the key 300 because for 180x the way
that they've actually managed to fit all
this hardware in virtually the same size
case is by switching things around the
orientation of some of the parts you can
see we have the power supply is now
mounted at the front of the case and
this is actually the new power supply as
well as the x2 the advanced 750 watt
unit I believe and it's actually got
this really nice LED panel on it can't
really see right now you probably saw it
in the b-roll of the q500 P we're
lighting up purple and stuff gives you
some really nice diagnostics of your
hundred unit like temperature fans being
empowered draw of course a very very
handy little unit there and obviously
you get again full-sized hardware
support in here actually really like
this case tons and tons of ventilation
front top on the bottom although you
know I thought was kind of interesting
because they have a ton of ventilation
on the bottom of the case but not really
like any feet so I was like what's the
point the point is that the feet are on
this side of the case meaning that you
can actually orient it sideways if you
don't break it like so and now you have
air flow coming through virtually every
single side of the system except
nice so cube 580 X Tower of the size of
a micro ATX chassis it's it's beautiful
they like all these cases that the
Masters bring in to markets I'm gonna
switch to a cam here alright alright
how you guys doing I haven't looked at
chat in a while Lyle does not get
anything Lyle does not get someone make
a Lyle logo what would that looked like
probably just a face of while he is the
logo
he is the brand yeah you guys like that
that case pretty neat looks good that's
unmasked
yes and congrats again to isaac Martinez
for for being the first prize winner if
if four will be able to reach out to him
to Isaac we were able to reach out to
okay cool Isaac feel free to reach out
to us somehow if if we can't contact you
what will find you will find you one way
or another but I think it's time for
another giveaway because because I
really have too much hardware around me
right now
and I would like to get rid of it
obviously so we have another keyboard no
I was just okay you're good honey
so this is the other one we're giving
away right okay so if you guys liked the
way that this one looked and you're a
bit more of a power user or you fiddle
with numbers a lot you just like the
number pad we're gonna give this away as
well right
friggin now again this is the SK six
five one in USB type-c

and the second one Jonathan is from
twitch so wife you saw us doing a good
job
equal opportunity giveaway winner picker
yeah
I'll have to part with this for now very
very sad
you liked his what Candice Oh
so Jonathan you were picked because
wifey sauce like the Panda emojis that
you put in chat I told you I told you it
would work
you got it you got a you got a cater to
your audience you know so that's what
I've learned that's the wisdom I can
impart to you all right
panda we we pretty much covered like all
the parts in case you guys were curious
about pricing
once again the NR 400 which was the
first case we looked at 59 bucks the NR
600 the full ATX version of that is $10
more and then I believe the the
prototype that we saw here I'll take a
look at it again just to jog your
memories the prototype here the Q 500 P
isn't really decided on a price yet it
really just depends on the material that
they use for that front panel whether
they go with that nice kind of fabric
master material that I really like so
much kind of reminds me of a Google home
max speaker or something like that or it
could be aluminum or plastic whenever
they go with I think it's going to
determine the price and the range
they're looking at based on what that
front panel is going to be made of is
anywhere from 85 to a hundred bucks
which i think is a pretty fair price
point and then yeah and then the
keyboards keyboards oh you guys there
iam keyboards I believe the the SK six
to one this little little guy right here
is gonna go for a hundred and twenty
dollars again these are for the wireless
bluetooth keyboards okay
120 bucks and then it's going to scale
up $20 from there to the SK 631 and then
another 20 bucks for the full-blown SK
65 one
right here alright then we we are just
so friggin efficient I think we've
covered all the things that cool amass
don't want us to cover product wise
which is which is really great we do
have time for some Q&amp;amp;A though so I know
over the course of the stream like I
said wifey sauce has been betting some
questions for me
curating a list and they can be they can
be pretty much anything to be product
related to what we just talked about
maybe it's a coolermaster product that
we didn't even feature today or it could
be something more personal or about CES
in general about the show I think eyes
are curious at all about that so let's
start with the first question
see what is your favorite tech item CES
2019
I don't have one yet I don't have a
favorite I usually never have a favorite
at any of the shows just because there's
they're all so different it's really
like comparing apples to oranges you
know I think certain products leave more
of a lasting impression than others some
of the weird crazy experimental you know
products that some of these vendors come
up with is is always fun to see but I
don't really have an actual favorite
what headset is that what headset is
this
mhm 7:52 MH 752 from coolermaster it is
one of their own and I gotta say this
sponsorship side it's extremely
comfortable like I could wear this all
day I don't know if like the person who
is wearing this before has a big head
like me no one was wearing it but it's
just it has amazing clamping force it's
like the perfect clamping force for my
sized head and is its memory foam or is
this like faux leather whatever it is
it's extremely comfortable they're like
they're like clouds on my little pillows
on my ears and obviously the but the mic
is coming through the the webcam so it's
not this mic I haven't tested this
microphone but extremely comfortable
headset thank you for asking that let's
see what else we got what else we get
are they gonna keep selling the Q 300 l
yes yes they are
good I think that's a great case
especially if you're looking for a micro
ATX option craps machine you play that
electric crap did the electronic craps
it's fun yes yes it is fun actually for
the past two almost three nights in fact
me and my entourage we've been been
finding our way to that craps machine
and I think we're all pretty much up I'm
up like almost 500 bucks and yeah so
that's that's where all your donations
go you know into the craps machine so
we're doing good it's super fun I like
it because you know it's a bit a little
less intimidating than like walking up
to the table
people are like looking at chillin
you're gonna give me a good roll gonna
be an ass so I think it's a lot of fun I
really enjoy it kind of go casually at
your own pace any macros available on
the SK 6 5 won any macros that you can
maybe do either via the hardware or or
software
okay sure
they're gonna go get their a peripherals
rep she is an expert at peripherals
that's that's why they hired her and
we'll be back with an answer for you on
that in just a moment
whoo oh that's a good question
best CPU in the Rison series for gaming
at 1080p on a budget on a budget I mean
on a budget is so vague right budgets
are very broad I think if you're if
you're really trying to to milk the cow
is that saying I probably not if you're
trying to stretch your dollar
I think rising 3 is a great option even
like a risin 320 200 G is pretty solid
any other rising three chips really
depending on how many cores you're
trying to leverage if you're using
multi-threaded applications games
obviously are starting to utilize and
leverage more cores yes there are macros
there are macros on the 65 one
they just said macros in general so I
just guess I can
right it's all hardware-based great
perfect yeah you could just use the
function keys it's all hardware based
you can program your own macros
on-the-fly that's that's actually really
nice thank you very much all right let's
see I think I actually said 2200 G but
that's that's actually rising 5 so I
know that is those 3 that's of course
the the GPU are the APU I should say
with integrated Bega graphics and that's
that's actually a really good chip if
you're looking for a super casual gaming
on a super casual budget it's it's a
great CPU I love it
obviously you can scale from there if
you're looking for 6 cores 12 threads
then rising 5 is still great bang for
the buck option it's all the rice and
chips are are really good contenders
next up we have have you ever trained
jujitsu Kyle I have not but Lyle has and
he would probably kick my ass in a real
fight so I try not to make fun of him in
person
I'll give him all the hell and you
know on stream and stuff when he's more
than an arm's length away but he'll
he'll karate chop me in half man that
guy maybe maybe he'll show off his
skills to you guys someday thanks for
that very relevant question life is
awesome when will you build a ketchup
and mustard themed computer today right
now no we're not we're not gonna do that
today but that is that has been in the
plan that's been in the it's been in the
think tank for quite some time
wifey sauce actually wants to take lead
on that project I think it would be a
good good good outcome I think she'd do
a bang-up job the question is do you
actually use like the crappy you know
stock ketchup and mustard cables or do
you get that ish custom sleeved
I don't know it really just depends on
what your goals are what you're trying
to achieve is there's a lot of options
there's a lot of a little opportunity
that's a good question
how's your house coming along it's in
shambles it's terrible it's nightmare no
it's it's fine we still have a lot to do
this was kind of an awkward timing
because we have CES right here for a
whole week that we can't really tend to
the house and wait for sauce and I are
both still very anxious to get moved in
we haven't moved a single thing in there
yet I think there's just probably a six
pack in the fridge that's about it we
have to wait for all the floors and the
walls to be redone we just got the
plumbing done in the entire house the
entire house was still original
galvanized steel had to tear all of it
out replace it with copper better
thermal conductivity that way
super influitive plumbing and now
there's a bunch of holes in the walls
because that's how plumbers access pipes
so we have to patch all that and there's
a lot of work to be done but I think
once it's all done it's gonna be awesome
it's gonna be so awesome and still
looking forward to making all those
house blogs for you guys literally spend
to make a see what else we got her
great the CES out of ten and what year
was the best CES that you remember Kyle
the best CES well it's hard to rate this
one because it's not over yet is it
we're about where we're like getting
over the hump right now right now
there's a party going on tonight
you know and depending on it if I if I
come up come out up or down on craps
it really matters see yes I don't know
man it's it's it's been good I could say
it's been really good
slightly less stressful we're doing like
less videos this year you guys can
probably tell we haven't haven't a ton
of uploads or anything but the videos I
think are a bit more meaty and their
content and they're a bit more unique
than the typical kind of coverage that
we've done in the past so I'm really
joined the new format and we still have
quite a few videos to post for you guys
that are currently in the works I think
you're really gonna like them so I think
this is a great CES this is chucking up
to be honestly probably one of my
favorite CES is so far it's it's been a
really good one definitely update for
the Coolermaster beta software is there
any update for the Coolermaster beta
software do you yeah I think they might
be talking about the master plus is that
fir is that the software just for all
your peripherals or is that
okay got it they're continually working
on this the the Coolermaster plus
software it's on their website and
they're they're constantly iterating it
but yeah there should be more updates on
that in the near future for sure
favorite pizza toppings mushroom and
olive Thank You wife a sauce she knows
me better than I know myself I had to
think about it for a second she just
already knew yeah well Sherman old man I
can't go wrong
can't go wrong what's the best CPU for
144 Hertz 1080p gaming and video editing
honestly if you're trying to hit that
high refresh rate and you want and you
let's say you're pairing with a juicy
core freesync panel to really maximize
the performance and take full potential
of that you're gonna want a really fast
gaming CPU right now the 9900 K or I 9
is the fastest gaming CPU on the market
until they release the successor to that
but that's not gonna be for a while so
now do you need that chip to to game and
have that experience not necessarily if
budget isn't an option and you just want
to go balls to the wall I would
definitely recommend it but it doesn't
mean you can't get away with like you
know a CPU that's maybe a hundred fifty
to two hundred dollars cheaper and still
hit close or near that target especially
at 1080p so do snozzberries really taste
like snozzberries I am inclined to say
yes
although I believe the person who said
that originally was tripping on
mushrooms so what price is the headset
do you know how much this costs nine
nine nine nine that's not it's not
$10,000 it's $99.99
Oh what's the model number on that one
okay the nhsn 751 is 89 and and it
doesn't have a built-in sound card like
this one does or an included sound card
thank you very much
oh let's see did you do oh this is
interesting
so I did cover this earlier but I'll
just reiterate the price of the wireless
keyboards that we took at earlier we've
got the SK 6 to 1 which is going to
retail for 120 dollars and then for 20
bucks more
you've got the ska 631 and the SK 6 5 1
which is the one with the 10 key number
pad is going to retail for 160 us second
I can remember things yay
when little cooler master release the MK
850 January 29th and that was with sort
of like a raised eyebrow and a hold on
one second while I double check but
January 29th seems like the tentative
release date for that a great question
and then we also have
software will take maybe all take maybe
like three more questions here and that
will we'll move on to some other
festivities okay
see I'm here to be how much plus I can
ask you guys this one this might be a
peripheral question is there any
software to control the Coolermaster
addressable RGB a i/o master plus hey
this master plus right okay got it
that's funny because he they they put
master plus at the end of Aurora's sync
yeah cool it's funny cuz he put master
plus at the end of his question so it's
like he answered you're good you're
really good you know I always ask
questions I know the answers to it makes
me feel smart what is the case of the
computer behind you look so cool with
all the RGB stuff in it I can barely
afford LED fans this is the cosmos which
one is it the C 700m cosmos C 700 M this
thing is an absolute beast
it's probably squeeze wifey sauce in
there looks like you can probably fit
like gdb motherboards as well it's uh
it's gargantuan one two three four five
six seven eight nine there's like
there's like nine 140 millimeter fans
right in there oh if I change the shot
really quick course it's got the B cam
for you right there I love that curved
tempered glass panel too
oh yeah you're gonna trust me then gonna
trust me can handle this right now
oh it's saying AHA man it looks so much
harder but then it's so graceful easy to
open hearts
that's a nice AI Oh - which one is that
again master liquid 240 Mirage and I
like that is that the impeller inside
there that you can see that's really
cool it's kind of transparent I don't
know how open look you guys can get
there I like that you guys use the
g.skill crystal the Royal RGB that's
that's check enough to be my favourite
grams kids right now very nice thank you
for asking that question
what else we got here favorite keyboard
switch I'm gonna go old school and be
kind of boring and say Cherry MX brown
just because not a personal fan of Blues
or any clicky switch just annoys the
hell out of me it annoys me when I'm
typing on them and like when somebody
else is doing it near me I just want to
blow my brains out but also I do like
the tactile bump that's cherry MX blue
halfs so the brown kind of has best of
both worlds and it's also the first
Cherry MX which board it's actually the
first chair mix which that I ever used
regularly it was it was actually a
cooler master it was a cooler master
trigger it was a CM storm trigger it was
my very first mechanical keyboard and
had cheerio x brown switches and I just
I typed on that thing into oblivion okay
m'kay 8:50 we have an answer January
29th scratch that it's actually February
28th so she was close
all right let's see here okay they're
asking this disc Coolermaster have any
new mini ITX or land box cases for the
CES I would say like that Q that Q 500p
looked like it could be a pretty good
land box and also the Q 500 l both
jassi's that we looked at today there
what's that yeah and the NR 400 actually
yeah they're they're not they're they're
all micro ITX or ATX but they're really
small footprint
chassé ease they don't take up a lot of
space even if you have a really tiny
desk like I do at home
they're great options for that I
especially like how the the Q 500p has
those candles on top that makes it
really easy to tote around that's a
great feature and obviously they have
all their existing a lot of existing
cases for Coolermaster that that are
even smaller form factor if you're
really trying to cut down on size
possibly check back in June that sounds
like Computex time frame so maybe they
got a few tricks up their sleeve in that
department maybe
wink-wink nudge-nudge Coolermaster can
you make motherboard GPU Ram everything
it's like it looks like you got a it
looks like you got a big fan here if
they're willing to yeah if you're
willing to buy it
hey if there's money involved if you
make it it will sell yeah who knows I've
seen some random products from other
vendors that I'm like what you you make
this now like yeah we're trying to make
everything
it sounds like a tall order but I'm sure
it could be done all right here let's
see Oh interesting is there any way I
can repair one of my broken Coolermaster
power supplies I have some batteries can
these help yeah that's how that's how it
works
good good good troll but in all serious
in all seriousness to anyone who doesn't
know this is a joke or they're actually
considering repairing their own power
supply don't if your power supply is
broken buy a new one because it could be
extremely it is extremely dangerous to
crack open a power supply even when it's
often not powered in there's still
residual power in there people have died
in the past for I'm trying to tinker
with their their PSU so please don't
please don't if there's any PSA or
information to take away for this dream
don't kill yourself with the power
supply it's not worth it
alright Coolermaster jacket the question
mark question mark question mark
question mark
yes actually looking pretty fly here hey
you know what if they can make jackets
certainly make GPU RAM and everything
else this is a really nice jacket Ashley
I might I might wear this to all of the
competitors Suites just to piss them off
you know it'll encourage them to just
give me free clothes to step up your
game okay alright that's good uh let's
see maybe we'll do all right
okay cool yeah that'll be the last
question we got two more here than any
cases in the style or price range of the
nb5 30p any cases in the style of price
range of the NV 513
right
and what yeah okay yeah so I mean the NR
400 in the NR 600 actually fairly
similar in InDesign and the price is
also super competitive
59 and 69 respectively all right and
then we got this last question that I'm
sure all of you guys are going to be
curious about which is what's the last
thing you're giving away that's a great
question
we actually have a power supply speaking
of well we can give away a jacket too
that's that's great you guys see it's
good to ask questions you might get free
stuff out of it so we're gonna give give
two things away right now
all right the first thing is gonna be
the power supply will say the jacket for
less got to say best for last
so first first we're going to do a power
supply it's actually one of their the
metonym 850 watt units let's see here
boom yeah the V Platinum 850 see what's
up out in April it's out in April so
would we be giving it away to the April
timeframe or where they get it early it
would get it early you would get it
before everyone else you should feel
special if you win this so that's
exciting you're gonna get it before I do
never happens
all right so what is it was winner
number three spam emojis in chat that is
the only request we ask that's his only
request spam those emojis go
wifey sauce is on the prowl she's she's
she's a lurking Wow look at that focus
she looks so focused slow like all right
oh wow I guess we asked for it
wait you gotta wait you gotta wait for
it keep going keep spamming the emojis
we've got to wait for a YouTube chat to
catch up there's probably a 35 minute
delay on every YouTube stream I've ever
done so here we go now the emojis are
flowing oh yeah Wow
the YouTube emojis are so much more
limited you realize that the twitch ones
when you actually see the side by side
they get like happy faces and like an
avocado on on YouTube you get all kinds
of goodies on on twitch so wifey sauce
is gonna is gonna pick she's gonna pick
real soon real soon
now we're gonna drop it in alright
submissions are closed she is she's
locked down she's hunted down a winner
and she's pasting it in chat or in the
dock alright another drum roll please
winner the Platinum a 50 watt unit is
okay what's your question
after this way to be anticlimactic
damn the sabotage stream all right the
winner is steel killer 1 1 2 5 on twitch
yeah you want a power supply and we'll
be reaching out to you shortly so that
we can get you one of those ASAP awesome
Oh what's your question shaving now that
I'm done
you know what I it's a it's a good
question the question is I didn't you
know I I'm like a single-core CPU so the
question was why am i drinking my beer
with ice because you guys had already
done that question in chat many times I
am like a single-core CPU I cannot
parallel process so like what I'm
focused on something it's all I'm
fixated on I don't know if it's like
just tunnel vision I probably have some
disorder so when I just saw a beer and
cup I didn't I was like talking I'm
thinking about something else a million
miles away and now I feel really stupid
and self-conscious that I'm drinking
beer with ice you know I'm gonna just
own it I'm just gonna own it when I do
something stupid I just own it and I'm
just like everyone still here it's it
forces you to drink it faster before it
gets watered down sounds like an odd
thing to say let's move on all right
let's uh let's go with our last winter
here for the badass Coolermaster jacket
why this Austin I picked one yet let's
let's switch it out what all right
just alright this is gonna be a
free-form alright open forum put any
words any phrase any comment in chat
within reason and wifey sauce will once
again pick one of you guys out to get
one of these lovely jackets in the size
of your choosing of course nothing's
worse than getting like a really cool
piece of clothing for free and it's like
two sizes too big for you and it just
becomes like a pajama shirt or
I don't know sure for your friend Ted so
oh no don't pick the person who says RGB
we don't want RGB comments we already
have it on everything else I see Kyle is
BAE I like that one so many options so
many options alright so in the meantime
while she's locking down a winner for
the jacket which I know all of you want
let's let's talk about what we're gonna
do after this really quick so we have
probably like a good half an hour to an
hour left on this dream before we gotta
shut things down and in that time I was
think about playing some games I know
about you guys but I do have some games
loaded up on this system which by the
way shout out to this awesome system
that I brought along with me this is
actually the Dan case a for SFX bill
that I assembled a couple weeks ago you
guys are probably familiar with it it's
got the Rison seven 2700 in there non ex
because the 92 millimeter liquid Aereo
that's on it just wasn't really capable
of handling that TDP so 2,700 we still
got eight core 16 threads in there with
the GT X 1080 TI mini from ZOTAC 16 gigs
of ram I believe it's the G skill with
just five ddr4 3200 speed and and just
an awesome and awesome little little
system Dan case a 4 I mean we're doing
this whole operation on a system yay big
it's it's beautiful oh and then we've
got the camera down there so you guys
can actually see it it's a little bit
cramped down there it might be a little
hard to see I can probably can probably
move it just slightly without without
destroying the whole stream you can see
look at how much connectivity we've
literally occupied I believe almost
every single port
except for the video card I'll you know
the rear i/o and the motherboard this is
this is it this is everything right now
if this goes down baby I'll see you guys
tomorrow
this is but this thing's been doing that
it's been her and her in like a champ it
did overheat though when we were
rendering last night took a little bit
longer to render than usual because the
CPU was actually thermal throttling
which is never good all right we're back
on Ken hey so you're good there thank
you guys but but yeah I mean it's it's a
fantastic system this is really my first
time using it in this way and in this
capacity on the scale out in the field
that's kind of exactly why I built it I
think in the mid gonna have to go back
to the drawing board a little bit and
figure out how to reduce the thermal
throttling but still keeping the case I
don't know if I'm gonna have to dumb
down to Horizon v chip that kind of hurt
we were actually considering that if if
the render if media encoder kept
crashing and we couldn't actually get a
video rendered because temps are too
high of like putting that 92 millimeter
a oh just the radiator in like an ice
bucket and then just and just working
our way through it that way but yeah
things are things were swimming along
here so alright we have a winner we have
we have a jacket winner we have a jacket
winner and he's attached why for sauces
once again picked him out for his
brilliant comment this winter just
attach it really quick the winner the
cooler master giveaway jacket is John
Kennedy John Kennedy thank you very much
Sean Kennedy and his comment was
meow-meow please pick me
I'll send cat pics so it's like it's
like you know how to humor wifey sauce
like you know you get her you understand
her so John Kennedy thank you very much
congratulations we'll be sending you a
Coolermaster jacket just like this one
very soon all right guys what should i
what should I play I don't have like a
ton of games here but I have some I have
some haven't
we could just go do a benchmarking
stream we could just benchmark live you
know that would probably take the system
I don't want to put a load on it that
hard let's see what do we got here
we have csgo I do like me some csgo even
though I'm really bad at it hold a nice
source that would be kind of fun left 4
dead 2 I have left 4 dead 2 Pub gee I
don't have fortnight don't even ask me I
don't have it just go away and I have
rocket League I've got a couple
single-player games as well
GTA 5 I guess I can't do GTA 5 online
though because Rockstar banned me know
if you guys know that they banned me
like a year or two ago for using mods in
campaign mode I was in single-player
using mods really just for for content I
was making videos on certain mods and it
just i just banned me i tried to log in
online once without the mods enabled and
i got permabanned and i've never played
GTA online GTA 5 online since that day
so so yeah so yeah that was it that was
my cool story as my cool story to stall
time will I create a straw poll which
game should be play
we've got rocket League I should've done
this before so I'm prepared rocket
League we have csgo
there's pub G let's see I don't have
Battlefront 2 I apologize
and then maybe we can do gold a nice
source hold a nice source if that game
like still works and runs properly left
4 dead 2 2 and that should be good so
I'm gonna create the pole I'm pasting it
in chat go get it boys get it get it
yeah let's just impromptu stack attack
right now totally prepared for that what
do it now
I don't know you should find them in
chat oh look at the lookit you can look
at there's an option to see all the
people in chat just find their name just
search around for it alright
actually that brings up a good point so
at the end of the stream we're gonna try
reaching out to all the giveaway winners
if you happen to be a giveaway winner
stay till the very end of the stream if
you can and and don't leave that way we
can still see you in the viewer list and
we'll be able to contact you that way
otherwise could get could get tricky so
let's see what you guys voted for here
I'm not screen capturing because there's
too much sensitive info on here so
that's okay I'm just gonna go look at
the results really quick and see what
you guys want me to play alright 28
percent are saying csgo 27 percent
followed by closely followed by pub G
rocket League and then we've got left 4
dead 2 and Goldeneye source so I'm gonna
do see us go baby let's go go yeah this
is cool I'm spending my CES streaming
video games like I I win the Internet I
win today whoo
alright load her up let's go to rap I'm
not drinking my beer fast enough
okay cool
I've already got the webcam set up well
you got to do the first time setup for
csgo it's already installed but you know
gotta initialize install directx and
stuff oh yeah
so what you guys doing today did you
guys see the AMD keynote who watched the
AMD keynote this morning I did what do
you guys think I think I think Radeon
seven what's cool what's really cool
$6.99 that's not quite as much as a RTX
2080
that more than an RT X 2070 hopefully
performance will be somewhere in between
there to match the price accordingly
Vega to baby second gen they got true
set true 7 nanometre GPU first of its
kind very exciting stuff
and like I love I love watching Lisa sue
- she so she just seems so chill like
I'd love to have like a coffee with her
or beer I'd want to have a beer with her
she just yeah she doesn't have like this
overinflated ego for for being like the
CEO of this mega tech company she just
seems chill you know I like her I'm
bigger all right we got csgo here oh
yeah oh yeah
what the hootenanny is that ere we go
yes yes
Oh game volume why you so loud let me
make sure that you guys can hear the
game volume too but just not super loud
will do default speakers play and
ha
there we go
come on csgo where you at csgo doesn't
seem to want to work it's not actually
oh okay now it's working so no audio
settings down down boy
have you got one alright let me make
sure that you guys can see what I'm
seeing as well so let's add source Game
Capture now can you see that no you
cannot why oh yeah you can yay and then
I can do a little fancy pinging like
this and then shrink me make me all
small and stuff and then I can crop I
can do things I know how to do computer
things yes yes looks so good
by God alright dude Dan
Oh yogi can you guys hear the in-game
audio in-game sound should be somewhat
audible but not too crazy Cal Superchick
oh sure oh you know what maybe I could
do that ads not a bad idea
if I remember to get around to it maybe
I'll read some of the super chat
donations that someone pointed out in
chat it really depends on how much time
we have after after doing some gaming
because that was the plan but let's just
go into the game let's do judge death
match no one games sound how interesting
oh I think it was just well alright I
just turn it up now check how does it
sound recording along with my voice do
it about a ten-second delay
oh you know what I also need to do is
turn this into windowed borderless I
remember now well I don't know fight
yeah okay sure it's csgo well full game

who joined whether you're still here you
left appreciate you guys joining in
happy s count on a hmm yes I could do
that
only because I love you
boom
will it capture fraps though
don't think it well but I could do guys
is I could do a monitor capture just on
the game screen capture monitor capture
ooh
which desktop is it little window
capture no I'll do it monitor capture
desktop let me let me make sure I'm
choosing the right desktop I believe
desktop one should be it so are y'all
ready for this
hey cool look at that I captured the
actual monitor instead of the
application and now you can see the
fraps counter up there at the top let me
just make sure that you can see mob we
were to hold for is over boom looks good
okay look at that 115 frames per second
in the menu glorious
can't search
why does it take so long to get into a
match am i doing it wrong should I
should I do a different one guys should
I do like competitive casual war games
let me know if there's a better way of
doing this
so I'm actually playing on a 60 Hertz
for klg panel it's it's a relatively
cheap 4k displays it's 24 inch IPS and I
think we got it for like around 300
bucks or something like that but it's
really nice they've been great to have
side by side when editing at the hotel
room it looks super sharp very crisp and
they're there okay - game on - if you
don't mind 60 Hertz which I I personally
don't if I'm just casually gaming you
meet the cash let's do the cash let's do
the cash I cancel cancel cancel cancel
I like cos T's we're going ha STIs save
the people my thoughts on the the
control pad maybe you're talking about
the their aim pad the cooler master aim
pad I haven't had a chance to check it
out but they did send anyone its back at
the office
I'll probably do a video on it at some
point at some point soon I'm very case
to check it out especially with a super
hot I want to try playing superhot with
it I think that's like the perfect
application do you ready to mute eight
people clap good good call I think I
already have voice chat disabled but I
can double check
yeah
should be and I haven't changed anything
so as far as I know it's Wi-Fi hotspot
still enabled and everything
all right I'm going to restart csgo per
your guys's request maybe that will help
speed things up let's give it a shot
the error message isn't in the top right
got it
yeah if it don't work I'll play the pub
geez let's try this again
jumping in
searching
be able to reach any official servers in
it maybe there's some sort of are you in
spiral okay let didn't work all right
looks like we're gonna have to try plug
G guys for some reason the cs go server
is just aren't connecting i should say
we're not connecting to them so all of
you who voted for pop g which is only
like a percent or two behind are in luck
we're gonna go ahead and check that out
let's see and if this doesn't work then
it could just be the connection that we
have here for some reason it's it's uh
can't bring with our IP
we're preparing to launch yes you can
see I have an activated windows I don't
care I don't care even if you and don't
even bother adding the on Steve I I have
so many requests I'm not I can't and I
can't and you guys I haven't added my
own friends on the steam like the
requests been pending for like two years
we yeah sorry I'm not gonna dig through
all of them so it's looking like it's
gonna take way too long to watch pop G
as well because apparently there's a
huge update 13 cake update 14 big update
that I didn't see coming which is weird
because it didn't say that there was an
update pending earlier this week or
actually even yesterday so was the next
game on the list you know if this at
this rate we're just gonna end up
playing minesweeper and you guys just
have to live with that I'm sure you'd
love it actually
you even have minesweeper no we don't
I'm not sad you're living in an age
where minesweeper doesn't come
pre-loaded onto your Windows operating
system could do rocket League could
always do rocket League or
a nice source although no one plays
school dinosaurs I'd be playing I just
being a server by myself there's golf
new friends but I'm gonna switch over to
old can actually you know what I'll
create a new create a full new see in
case you guys are wondering it's the
Logitech c920 to 1080p basic webcam
looks it's really good though it's
really good oh yeah so uh in the
meantime just stop downloading this
actually the internet here's pretty fast
I think we have like 100 both ways but
still not fast enough to download the
pugsy update although if we were at our
hotel room at the the nisshin a gigabit
both ways though if you guys saw my
tweet hardwired in of course but a
freakin full gigabit it's insane and
that's uh I was supposed to even at the
PX planet just shocking for Vegas
all right so do some rocket League you
give us to get you know in the meantime
I can actually read off some super chat
donations for you guys who were very
gracious to donate on youtubes you just
see if I can bring that up here studio
it's under community that makes people
chat so hard to access good rocket
League just launched in and just shifted
all of my windows everything's messed up
thanks we'll come back to that let's see
I'm interested in reading comments
attached to the donations that guys sent
me
and bear in mind since we are short on
time it doesn't mean that if you guys
said any super chats in starting from
now that I'll read those comments it's
just gonna be the ones that have been
sent already up until this point let's
see
starting on
it's a very generous Sam hyena a $2
donation was invidious booth
underwhelming I don't know I haven't
been there yet but I heard I heard
relatively good things heard
I haven't heard a lot of things but from
what I had a little I have heard people
were saying it's worth checking out
it's kind of interesting now that
they're supporting freesync on their
g-sync display or actually that they're
their ten series cards enough are going
to be supporting freesync that's that's
a whole video topic on its own yes I
know what you think of that dari go be
$5 bork bork I'm a dog fortnight dire
wolf for life you playing fortnight
later in the stream probably not dairy
probably mainly because I don't have a
fortnight installed and I'm really bad
at it if you've ever seen me play csgo
like on stack attack you know that I am
at that I'm like three times it's bad at
fortnight it's just really sad no one
wants to see me play fortnightly it's
just so thanks for the donation work
fork Tyler Stalin's in Dallas make you
Hollis

the only fortnight dance I know of is
the stupid floss one is that this Adam
that's a fortnight dance so what does he
do wait okay let me let me switch
cameras I'm just gonna do some time
since it was so cringy since it was so
cringy watching ninja do it I'm just

I'm really just projecting on on one of
his fails it's not all just me so it was
like it was like was it like a it was

if you're you know building a PC for
something as cool of space engineering
and you're doing something useful for it
or as I just make stupid videos online
I'm really glad that I can help you be a
smarter better person than me that's
cool dude Amy Westlake $2 your your new
house looks great
thank you Amy we like it it's why we
that's why we bought it and it's it has
a long way to go but end result should
be pretty glorious can't wait to share
with you guys
dingo i'm a 40 what's up dingo good to
see you haven't seen you in a while man
two bucks who is going to watch your cat
when you're away funny it's that's a
great question actually one that wifey
sauce and I have contemplated and
discussed many times we have a good
friend seems Mike I've known him since
high school he actually lives really
close really close to us
toward new house so he's gonna be he's
gonna be in charge of that he's mostly
responsible enough to handle that task
but it is gonna be nice to have him
nearby especially just check on the
house and we're gone for events like
this context and so forth so we do have
some good cat babysitters at our
disposal we also have Vincent van region
once again five euros Kyle Kyle third
question do you like vodka ever tried
Dutch beer and when I am in the USA for
holiday can I bring beer third superjet
notice me I do notice you I do see you
there
mr. Vincent and yes I like vodka which
is why I drink it straight I've never
tried Dutch beer but if you can somehow
find me in the United States or said it
to my P o box I would love to try some
will even probably pop a bottle or two
open on awesome hardware as we usually
do with my buddy Paul Josh Kelly two
bucks core i5 6500 GTX 1060 which to
upgrade first honestly dude the i5 6500
is still a great CPU he's still got quad
core right there the four cores are
gonna do some solid favors in gaming the
GTX 1060 is what I would change out
especially if you're talking about
gaming most games are still very much as
GPU bound so you would want to upgrade
that there's a lot of great options now
over the gtx 1060 obviously you don't
have to spend $1000 plus you know go
balls to the wall RTX but you can find
some pretty decent pricing on the teeth
the GeForce 10 series right now which
you know are fantastic cards 1072 1071
with the 1080 honestly if you could find
the 1080 for you know less than 500
bucks or something like that assuming
that it's in your budget it's gonna be a
really nice upgrade over the 1060 for
sure even a 1070 or I would say 1070 I
would be a worthwhile upgrade
particularly if you can sell that GTX
1060 and makes them your money back that
way
but yeah definitely that CPU is good to
last you for a few more years at the
bare minimum a near a Cernan this is our
last super check here for $10 are you
going to check out any booths like
Samsung or LG I would love to I'm only
gonna be on the actual show floor on
Friday and I'll be doing a really cool
video there that doesn't really involve
visiting any booths but if I have a
chance to swing by Samsung or Samsung or
LG I definitely will because they always
have some ridiculous over-the-top set
that that should be pretty cool let's go
ahead and switch over to cam a that way
or actually I'll do full-size full-size
me and there we go
looks good so that's all super check yep
mm-hmm
Isak wifey sauce is mad at you reach out
to wifey sauce or she will yell at you
just great for me because she can only
yell at one person at once but yeah she
still needs your info so hit her up hit
her up check your DMS she don't slide be
ugly all right let's play some rocket
League let's do it all right please work
for the love of God work yay all right
cool let's play play online let's do 3 d
3 3 d 3
let's do it let me go ahead and bring up
the game why is it starting already hold
on let me cancel make sure that you guys
can see here I'm gonna switch to
windowed borderless and let me just
enable it an excellent guy has to be a
second I said give me a minute guys all
right
rocket League let's rocket League not
support
fork why is there no 4k option what's up
well I think Isaac
Isak wifey sauce is having more issues
getting in contact with you so if you
can message her on either Instagram or
Twitter for Twitter both as a Mikey
sauce right just a wifey sauce on
Twitter go reach out to her and she will
get you all sorted my bro so for the
difficulties let's let's do let's do a
full-blown
you guys want the framerate counter on
for rocket League I mean it's probably
not a huge deal right but see if I can
do it anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna exit
the game and Milosz because I don't
think it's sledding me scalp to 4k for
that reason give me a SIA
I will not activate windows ever just
pointless kawatche Linus's video on why
he never activates windows I agree with
everything almost everything he says in
there
our options video air we go
you wait what wha what's happening
video borderless fullscreen windowed oh
I keep forgetting to hit why I am dumb
it always trips me out it's this UI this
menu is so bizarre because the applies
like right here in the middle of the
screen I always look for it down here
and I just completely miss it stay in my
life I just see a hand creeping from
underneath one of the monitors as Chris
is snagging one of one of the lines that
I have on my little desk here can't yeah
that's true it's Touche my friend you
cannot have a corona with that line
alright let's go blow up some cars
today on oh I mean yeah let me turn the
volume down for you guys live all you
is a bit on the loud side
let's try that that's not better guys
that sound data
today one line
okay okay I don't shout shout sorry I
can't control my loudness allowed this
that's why that's why I'd never stream
like scary games because it would
literally blow people's ears now and I
care about you know very passionately
okay
oh my connection to the game timed out
it seems like for whatever reason the
network that we're on which is hardwired
into the hotel's Ethernet port is just
not letting us connect to any of the
game servers that we're trying to load
up I mean up GECs go and now rocket
League we can do single-player okay cool
yeah that's why yeah let's see what time
is right now 3:30 okay no worries huh
okay sure no problem
I did have to be specific to see em er
okay sure
all right all right you know what
to hell to hell with all of this we're
gonna do single-player now as far as
single-player games they do have dead
shadow the Tomb Raider which I think
that needs an update
let's just do that we have hitman
Hailee's I used to use it for
benchmarking then we also have was the
other one
oh yeah this games that I benchmark all
the time ashes of the singularity I
don't think anyone plays that game gets
benchmark more than it gets played just
a global basis we have doom doom is
always fun GTA 5 i control around in GTA
5 and then met your last light which i
don't think i've ever played that your
last night
but I have 26 hours locked all from
benchmarking I've benchmarked Metro last
light for 26 hours guys GTA 5 I actually
played I have 713 hours logged for that
and then do 113 hours doom I did beat I
did I did play that one all right let's
uh let's see
you guys have guys have any opinions on
a single-player campaign I don't have
Skyrim installed I'm sorry
you want me to play that you just want
me to play the ashes of the ashes of the
singularity benchmark but just just like
just make commentary on it all right I
see some GTA 5's in here let's do it
let's do it this is actually pretty cool
I think this is also a good game to show
off right now because it's very scalable
there's a ton of different settings in
the game and you can really get away
with playing it on a wide variety of
systems and you'll get to L be
interesting to see what kind of
framerate sorry we get while we're
streaming as well and maybe I can pull
up some system diagnostics if I have any
patience which do
whereas I could be blind but I'm pretty
sure I have after murder on here
somewhere
this wish to see for her now
and after
burner a man
all right we're just gonna have to do
fraps counter will do a fraps counter
I'll pull up some some monitoring apps
here for my own reference and then I
could just like tell you guys what
parameters we're seeing worked what sort
of data before saying
I'm gonna go full screen actually I
would love to see CPU temps right
let's get there
full screen
let's let's play let's play a 4k
full screen let's do window borderless
up tonight alright let me show you guys
so you can see the frame counter it's a
tea bitty itty bitty up there how well
you guys can see it but it's there
let's take a look at our other graphic
settings I'm gonna do 2x msaa just
because it looks a little a little
jagged without it vsync off course for
that very high pretty much all across
the board and let's do a shout his role
on she got a distance story mode
oh yeah okay in case you guys are
wondering what I'm actually gaming with
apart from the headset which Verity
mentioned I also do have the master set
ms 120 mouse this is our own this is my
own personal mouse that I brought with
me from home I really like this house
it's affordable has a rubber cord which
I know a lot of people prefer that over
graded a lot of cases it's got super
chibi on it
very precise sensor as well it's a nice
Mouse and then I've also got this is the
SK 6 3 1 I believe right this is though
the wired USB type-c which is just so
good for travel Franklin Franklin
alright I got I'll try to get you guys
so much
let's jump in game audio let me turn the
game audio down sorry
no master boy um in here they have all
the settings in the world but no master
volume option oh I should not have any
music
that's fine that'll do
oh don't drink and drive people stop
drinking right
so all right just so you know just to
reiterate we're streaming we're
streaming at 1080p 30 frames per second
and the game is running at 4k very high
settings and we're getting about 45 fps
right now driving through the
neighborhood the game looks great
fps is a little low for my taste I like
to see 60 at the very least so I'm gonna
I'm going to do some stuff I'm actually
going to crank down the resolution to
1440p and take care of what let's bring
that
and there's our 60fps obviously it's
gonna dip here and there
actually it's still okay now that we're
in the city it's actually still going
back down to about 50 in the 50 range
but how does this look on streaming okay
so it's a little laggy
well laggy okay maybe
is it laggy there there's like a
right right but I mean the actual
gameplay is choppy right okay Chris is
actually looking at on his phone we seem
to see it on mobile it looks pretty good
on mobile but you guys are saying that
it looks bad on desktop tell the Dipsy
oh let's see frames wrong why you keep
moving like that those frames drop zero
that's weird
exploit is reporting zero drop frames
but you guys are still saying it's just
laggy as Hale
to be be encoding Luciana you switch the
resolution
good now
you have the bit rates not the best
it'll probably look a little bit cleaner
on twitch than YouTube the YouTube
compression is also at play here not too
bad I would rather have it less choppy
than than crisper to be honest
it could be the can be the ferry I could
probably have turned up with it made a
little bit but definitely didn't want to
push things too hard particularly the
system this is a lot for a little system
to handle right now we've got about
still getting very playable framerates
i do some cheats like what's a good
cheat
well good sheets taste a good I used to
know all the good sheets didn't you
cheat chat please copy/paste a cheat in
chat that they would like me to use dg5
you see five it's on PC oh well hello
your uh this is this is what they're
saying right here so they can't see you
there why he saw Stu tried to roll the
video but she wasn't even in frame so
she was making all these faces that no
one could appreciate a she is you did it
well played well played wifey oh yeah
what
how get mauled ear
we can't play csgo because we can't
connect to any of the game servers we
can't play any online games with our
network connection here at the hotel
which is too bad but this what it is I
don't what you got I suppose senseless
senseless violence
taking out all my frustration over in
stress over zes streets of Los Santos Oh
lots of cheats thank you very much Chris
all right let's take a look here let's
do uh let's first do the invincibility
one which is not here oh no now what is
it called it's called the pain killer I
think there it is another one called
what's what's Skyfall deal oh it makes
you drop from the sky I hope I have a
parachute and I don't but it's okay
because I'm invincible
so we'll just crash straight into the
floor that was that was fun I want to do
it
and then maybe we have another one here
called moon blue let's what's this motor
they also have liquor
so this is what flying in gta5 looks
like when drunk
the liquor helps with that headache
right there that
should've been walking a little it looks
a little toasted recharge ability okay
maybe bullets oh yeah I like that it's
just yeah
alright we're chillin for now this is
good hot hands let's get it it's gonna
get me a weapon going on here it's a
good melee weapon how do you change
melee weapons
explosive hammer yes come here come here
can I do it to a car can I blow up a car
with the hammer this will be
revolutionary ground brittle again he's
just super drunk Oh Franklin you're
making these cops pistols look very very
weak oh damn you know someone someone
probably made one of these in real life
okay plus get the bus yes
bust down our Pete bus down I could I
mean I don't mind if you guys drop out
now like this is fun to you because I
understand cuz I'll do this all day I
have done this whole bag come on I'm
tired man I'm drunk stop running away
from me
just stay still thank you rude
thank you hate your car
is the ultimate
they don't mark moon physics on I
thought it was supposed to do something
lota all right
oh yeah physics are on now but it seems
to only work when they their bodies fly
in the air
oh yeah there we go see I don't even
know why people need moths these sheets
are pretty good although you can't be
the hole can't turn into iron men of
these cakes okay okay you know what I
think I think I'm gonna have to cut a
game out for now because there are a
couple more questions that I would like
you guys to answer for the stream it's
part of this little shindig so I'm gonna
do that really quick so this is your
last chance for questions guys we're
winding down the street at this point so
if you have any coolermaster specific
questions in particular I would love for
you to paste them in chat whether on
Twitter or YouTube and we'll be
answering some final questions about any
Coolermaster gear plans and hopes and
dreams desires dark secrets everything's
on the table
all right so shoot him out shoot him out
last chance do a question Q&amp;amp;A blitz if
you will to go ahead and switch back to
moi looks like that your webcam guy
your shoes are untied
you can't see my shoes that's not yeah
you wouldn't know that people be
trolling
y'all be trolden aren't
do you prefer cooler or master it's a
very conflicted very conflicting
question I don't know I mean who's
cooler than the master really but then
again you could go both ways because
like what if you are the master there's
someone cooler does that make them the
master what defines a master what
defines cool why are we here
okay let's move on what GPU and CPU
that's not a cooler master question I'm
using a CM storm 1080 know that they
already they already oh oh oh GPU well
the GPU and CPU those aren't fully
master yeah where's my pea sauce she's
sitting right next to me where I can see
her
are you you're still pasting them in the
Google Doc honey yeah
okay I can also look through here okay
ooh
as Coolermaster going to come out with
more cosmos series cases that's a good
question are there going to be any more
Cosmo Series cases in the future sure
they're getting in a specialty special
specialist an expert product person to
answer that for you
the answer is I can't tell you that's
under NDA it'd be funny if all the
questions you guys asks I couldn't give
you answers do the NDA let's see
anything else anything else at all honey
okay yeah it does does Coolermaster have
an RGB air cooler yeah they have they
have several definitely yes even cooler
master halfs like it's not really a
question actually one of my favorite
recent RGB quarters of theirs is the
Haier 4 212 RGB Black Edition I think
especially for the price and the
performance that you're getting it like
I said it fixes everything that I didn't
like so much about the original and the
Evo and the ones that followed it it's
it looks great and it matches with
everything because it's blacked out it
just looks really stylish quite a bit
more expensive than it looks
has that
let's see when will Cooler Master
included USB header cable to their a i/o
so you can control them better be a
software is that maybe something that
you guys would look into to have like a
like a USB header cable that goes to
your motherboard perhaps for software
control or something like that
yeah
right yeah yeah actually they actually
do have ways for you to control the urge
you be already on on various CEOs
through their own and how software you
could do it through the motherboard
software as well and they even have
their own like part hardware controllers
that you can pretty much customize using
that way so yeah there's a lot of
flexibility in that sense
right now
yeah but that's actually a good point a
lot of their cases have integrated RGB
controllers just built right in so it's
really easy to hook up there you don't
need an external method showing your
lighting so definitely some flexibility
let's see
they might be asking about the RGB fans
in that case they're asking about how
much they might cost
aha
sure
what did he know that the model number
is modeling
okay
okay so if you're asking about the fans
that's in the cosmos case behind me is
the master fan 140s
those are addressable RGB of course so
they're more on the premium side they
definitely have a premium look and feel
so you're gonna expect an appropriate
price for that as well
but are those also available in 120 s
okay cool so you can get them in 120 or
140 varieties as well right those are
the ones that have like the dark lair
all integrated into one unit right oh no
those are the rear exhaust fan
yeah right so the fans that the rear
exhaust fan see if I can find at the
rear exhaust fan that was in the it was
the and our 600 that I showed you guys
earlier that's one of their new SF fans
I forgot to mention that earlier but and
it's kind of hard to tell in the video
let me see if I can find it right here
oh I should probably make it visible so
not these fans this is the sort of like
three-in-one integrated solution
that model will come single as well okay
so the span this rear fan is the SF
right and that rear exhaust fan that you
see there let me see if I get a better
shot of it here that's one of their new
SF fans here here come's
yeah and it's got look at that the
actual fan frame all around the fan
frame is RGB 24 LEDs all around
addressable RGB and the video honestly
doesn't do it justice it looks really
nice in person let's see any more we got
here any plans for asteroids on the new
line of master keys or are there any
plans for a new master keys line I mean
are they asking if you can play Android
or I'm sorry asteroids on the actual
keyboard you can play snake on it
so maybe that's probably what they're
asking them they probably want to see an
expanded game library on your keyboard
okay yeah no media plans just yeah work
on your snake game
are there any Coolermaster mice coming
out soon and then 8:30 mmm 8:30 January
15th any cool specs on that one or any
features okay okay
33 what sensor 3360 sensor it's their
first MMO Mouse 24k dpi is actually
really high first MMO Mouse and Omron
switches so that's its quality stuff so
we're gonna leave it that way
when will the online game store be
released for their keyboard lineup
online game store for your keyboard
lineup
I'm not sure they need my that yeah yeah
we're you might have to clarify them
yeah yeah I'm not sure which what you
mean by that but maybe you can clarify
we'll get back to you let's see
well they ever make a rack mount case
like a server rack mount case is that
maybe a little niche or no like an
actual like server rack where you've got
like like dozens and dozens of drives
like just all together yeah
okay so I guess they do make they do
make rack server cases on the OEM side
you just don't see him advertised in the
same circles as products we're talking
about today let's see anything else here
release date on the control pad May 2019
is when it will start shipping to
backers
so if you have to the back end on did
you guys do it on kickstarter indiegogo
kickstarter so if you if you are a
backer and Kickstarter for that product
May 20 1901 will start shipping out
that's exciting
see anything else does coolermaster I
have a cooler mistress don't know it's
very mysterious Coolermaster one day
maybe I'll get to meet him maybe he'll
he and I'll have a chat let's see oh no
I should not have just what I did he
stays at home you're welcome
okay maybe a couple more here guys
anything else
last minute questions that you want to
get in what's up Oh
are there any Coolermaster cases that
can support dual systems at the moment
right right
so technically there's there's no cases
currently that can natively do dual
system but they're saying the C 700 mm
is big enough so that if you wanted to
do some serious hell modifications
period that sort of thing
you could probably make it work because
the the interior is just incredibly
cavernous as you can see behind me you
could stack 2q 500 s III really like the
half stackers - I was a huge fan of
those I had two of them wanted for
gaming more for streaming let's see
that's my question you guys ever gonna
do an update or a follow up to the the
half stackers okay
oh nice they still have the tooling for
it
that's that totally means are gonna do
it do you have a - do you have a 280
millimeter radiator that's 45
millimeters thick do you guys have a
route of that spec 45 is wid sorry yeah
yeah so the pro model does have a 280
rad but maybe not 45 millimeters thick
maybe like 25 30 or something like that
which is a bit more standard for most
day i/o so but who knows maybe in the
future let's see anything else we'll do
maybe one or two more comment question
is buffering
okay not fully related is Paul still
hiding or has he left you for J wow wow
that's that's a deeper that cut to be
deep you know now he would never leave
me for J J's Jay Paul prefers a bottom
Jay would never be a bottom good I still
know I still know it grinds apolskis
alright you asked I'm sorry you're gonna
ask a question give you an answer let's
do one more clear-cut
coolermaster question best question of
all what I will do two more well do now
will do some more well Coolermaster
introduce all out clears and all out
clear or see-through case I guess maybe
just like tempered glass everywhere like
on multiple panels or
the H 500m it's pretty close to my
solution that one oh yeah that one's
actually pretty good the H 500m yeah oh
yeah obviously I mean Google that yeah
that actually is pretty pretty non
opaque through and through fairly
transparent so there is that one there
is that and that has tempered glass on
both sides right light left and right so
there you go
each 500m front panel - that's right
is it possible to choose different sorts
of dust filters Oh
maybe like on the like on the Q 500l
perhaps so every Q 500l will ship with
one of these I've just been told no
they're still working out the details
they're in cahoots about it and more
details will come to light on that
shortly let's see I think that's that
should be good did you find anything
else there wifey sauce lickin scanning
I said this is gonna be the last
question like ten questions but I have
all this beer here so I can keep going
yeah we did m'kay 50 was February 28 I
believe for that release yeah a lot a
lot of height a lot of hyper on the MK
50 okay is it safe safe to drink the
water inside of a water cooling wheel
yeah those the universal use a unanimous
know from from everyone in the room yeah
you know I don't know man how do you how
do you have internet to write that
comment but not fresh drinking water
okay all right this would be the last
question that we're gonna close things
down here which Coolermaster cases
support dat ex well that's that's a long
list they have some pretty sizable cases
that have those flexible larger form
factor options you can go on their site
for sure I mean obviously the case
behind me here the cosmos 700m is is
gargantuan and will fit the ATX no
problem there's a there's definitely a
bunch of other jassi's that you can look
up on their website they have the full
spec list there as well there's there's
definitely options to choose from if
you're if you're going for like a
powerhouse what name team or
each 500 M for sure yeah
and the SL 600 would may also be a
pretty good option that's true yeah
striker and trooper as well okay cool
I love those cases as well all right
guys I think that's gonna do it this has
been a super fun stream weed I mean a
bit with Kyle was forgot my Twitter
