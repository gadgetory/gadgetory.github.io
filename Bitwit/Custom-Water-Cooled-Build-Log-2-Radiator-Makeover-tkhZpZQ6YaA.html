honey sounds like it went really well
yeah I'm glad to be home is that a
computer case yeah it's the define us
from fractal design they run so quietly
I figured I'd put it there as a reminder
that in this crazy hectic world
silence really is golden is that the
same computer case yeah the define s
supports triple radiators water cooling
pumps and reservoirs so I figured I'd
put one there just to remind myself to
be flexible in life really in the
bathroom why well yeah I figured the
toilet hasn't been working lately and
the define us has such a spacious
interior that I just thought my god
the defined s from fractal design is
built for uncompromised custom water
cooling please use responsibly click the
link in the description for more info
what's up guys welcome back to the
channel and this is build log number two
we're going to be doing a little bit
more on my custom water-cooled build a
little bit more paint modding actually
because if you watch the first one first
build log you remember that I painted my
thermal armor that was pretty much it
but I'd like to take it a step further
and well just take a look here
so this is what I've done so far
nothing's really changed since the last
video you'll notice the the thermal
armor is gray and got some black in
there as well now going with a black
gray and hot pink color scheme today
what I'm going to be focusing on is
painting the radiators themselves now
you can see black obviously matches
quite nicely I could leave them black
but I just figure there's going to be so
much gray on the left side of the case
with the thermal armor the way it is but
there's not going to be much gray on the
right unless I do something about it so
obviously the liquid in here is going to
be pink got the black pump in the black
background
I'd like the radiator to be gray I think
that'll look really nice and kind
tie everything together a bit better
than it is now so what I'm going to be
doing today will be painting both
radiators I'm going to start off with
this one as and hope it goes okay
the reason why I'm starting with this
one is because you can't see it as much
in the case especially when the fans are
on the side panels on you're not gonna
be able to see this 360 radiator as much
so I'm going to start on this one first
just in case you know I learn any
valuable lessons the hard way it's with
the radiator that's not going to be
quite as visible in the chassis so I'm
going to be painting this gray and
you're gonna I'm going to do a little
time-lapse again I'm going to mask off
all the fins I'm not going to be I'm
gonna leave the fins alone these are
going to stay black I'm just gonna be
the frame of the radiator itself that's
gonna be gray and then I've got some
some fittings right here just just the
barbed parts that I'm going to be
screwing in and masking off as well
making sure not to get any any of the
spray paint inside of here because that
would be that'd be pretty bad and I
think that's pretty much going to do it
and I'm going to use the same hanging
contraption you're going to see all that
later so I think on that note I'm not
going to ramble too much more let's just
get to masking this thing and then we'll
do a first run do a few coats of gray on
this thing and see how it turns out
alright so here we got our radiator all
mashed off I'm asking this thing was a
lot easier and a lot quicker than
masking off the thermal armor just
because you're you're basically just
dealing with a large rectangle no funky
angles or shapes to deal with so it's
pretty easy masking all that off getting
the fittings as well this was quite easy
the only difficult part was getting the
little ek emblem right there obviously
only UK radiators are going to have that
but trying to get a perfect circle is
little tricky but I think it did an
alright job I always make sure to get
the back of the radiator as well and you
probably noticed in the time-lapse that
I kind of brushed over the whole thing
with this red scotch brite you could
pick up a sheet of this at the hardware
store for a buck or two really cheap
stuff just kind of went over that just
helps the the paint adhere to the
surface just a little bit better and of
course I'm going to be going with the
same color as I used for my thermal
armor which is this EXO rust
professional primer and paint in gray
and I think that's pretty much it my
hanging contraption is a little bit it's
drooping a lot more than it was
obviously this the radiators a lot
heavier than the thermal armor was I
would've got a coat hanger now that I
kind of wrapped around the two screws
that I kind of threaded into the
radiator I actually still have to mask
off the screw so I don't get paint on
them because I will be using these
screws when mounting it into the the
fine ash so apart from that I also had
to add another sandbag to the lighting
fixture so so doesn't fall over but I
think of them that we're pretty much
good to go so I'm gonna start shaking
this guy and we're gonna spray-paint
this thing
alright guys so this is the morning
after just woke up and came to check on
the radiator see how they're doing
and they're looking pretty good 360
actually came out really nice they're
they're almost fully dry at this point
but you can see it's just really smooth
all the way through however on the 240
you'll notice that it's kind of it's
kind of rough the surface is much
rougher than that it is on the 360 they
call this the orange peel effects
because it's got kind of like a textured
finish which is not desirable in most
scenarios the reason why this effect is
created is because well there's a couple
different reasons but I think in my case
I think what I was doing wrong was I had
the spray can just a little too far away
and I was following the recommendations
on the tin can that I was spray painting
with but apparently a lot of people
online say no go a little bit closer
because what happens is if your cans too
far away the particles of paint will
actually dry as soon as they hit the
surface or little dry midair and then by
the time they hit the surface of the
object you're painting it won't actually
go on evenly instead it'll just already
be dry and the results is this kind of
grainy finish that I'm not a huge fan of
but there is a way to rectify that and
I've already kind of started on it here
we turn this around you'll notice that
it is not as rough on this side but
although it's it's not as great year you
can kind of see a little bit of the
black bleeding through the gray and
that's because I've taken some 400 grit
sandpaper just like this stuff super
cheap get at the hardware store and I
kind of just sanded off some of the the
roughage if you will on the radiator on
this particular side and then now that
I've sanded it down I'm going to do one
more maybe two more I'm going to try to
get away with one coat because I don't
want to change the color too much but
I'm just going to spray again over this
one side and hopefully I can
results similar to this this one right
here on the 360 so I'm going to go do
that now and we're going to come back
few hours later and check up see how it
turned out alright guys so this has been
a full I think 48 hours since the last
clip that you just saw in this video
which means I've already sanded the
rough edge of this radiator down and
I've resprayed sprayed it with another
two coats of two very light coats of the
same color and you can see here we've
gotten a much smoother finish now all
the way across there's no more bumpy's
no more bumpy's I think I did a pretty
good job all things considering it being
my first time at all as you can see here
here's the 360 red good look at that so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
take all the masking tape off we're
going to be able to actually see this
thing without all this crap on it and
then I'm going to install it in the
define s over there with my motherboard
and we'll start to get a better idea of
what this rig is going to look like when
it's all done so let's do that now
alright guys so here is the rig so far
with the radiators installed I also kind
of installed some venturi fans that are
going to be right there and push
exhausting air at the top of the case
but here you can kind of just get a
better overall idea of the color scheme
going on like I said before this box is
actually pretty close to the color of
the liquid that I'm going to be using in
the system this is the liquid right here
the lighting doesn't really do it
justice but it is pretty close so I'm
just going to leave that bottle right
there so you can kind of get an idea of
the overall color color thing that I'm
going for
I think the radiators look really good
in here I think the extra number of
coats that I had to lay on the thermal
Armour obviously made it a bit darker
than the radiators so they kind of stand
out a bit more and they're not exactly
color matched but I think that's gonna
be alright because the cables leaving
that I'm doing is going to be a black
gray and dark gray so I think the gray
and dark gray will kind of complement
the different shades of gray here
between the radiator and the motherboard
pretty nicely but there you go there's
kind of a look you can also get an idea
I have all the fittings installed
I actually am in need of one two three
four more fittings I need for more
fittings as you can see I didn't buy
enough compression fittings the ones
here on the terminal need a couple and
I'm also going to need one for my drain
valve as well as one for the top of the
reservoir when I want to fill the actual
loop but everything else is good to go
I have all the parts ready oh I will
tell you that I did get this video card
in right here this ZOTAC gtx 980ti
amp Edition very cool card I'm going to
be doing a review of it probably this
week if I didn't get can get around to
it
and take it out for ya boom this thing
is a sexy beast this thing's been all
over the internet and you've probably
already seen some reviews of it online
but I'm gonna do my own take on it
I haven't even tested it out yet or
taken out of the box but I'm going to be
removing the cooler after the review and
it's going to be going into the pink and
gray build over there
so pretty excited to check it out and
then tear it apart completely and then
reinstall it put a water block on it and
all that good stuff so another thing I
wanted to point out is that I probably
mentioned this before but if I didn't
I'm planning on painting these fan
blades pink I think you know it'll just
complement the liquid nicely obviously
it'll be the exact same or as close as I
can be as close as I can get it to this
shade of pink right here I think they
need to match pretty closely in order
for it to work but I think the pink
blades especially when they're spinning
will look really cool with the black
frame and and trim around it so I'm kind
of stacking the colors you see like it's
it's gray black and then pink and then
kind of over in this corner it's going
to be you know gray black with the
reservoir the pump and then pink in the
in the reservoir right there so I'm just
I don't know I'm trying to balance it
out as we close up this video I just
wanted to go over some basic things that
I've learned about I guess painting the
first thing is to test everything you
aren't always going to find that perfect
color when you're the hardware store the
paint shop so find something else to
spray paint first just to make sure that
you like that color and that's the color
you want to go for before actually spray
painting your main object because once
you do that and it starts the drawing
stuff it's kind of a mess a huge pain in
the ass sometimes it's irreversible
depending on what you're spray-painting
to actually go in there and change the
color up the next thing I learned
obviously early in this video to hold
the can a little bit closer than you
might think to your objects so I would
recommend about eight inches like I said
before if you're too far away the
particles dry in the air before they
actually hit the surface of what you're
painting and that creates a really rough
nasty effect speaking of which if you
are to make a mistake like that take the
extra time to go back and fix it because
at the end of the day you're spending
you're already investing a lot of time
into modding or painting whatever it is
you're painting so you want it to look
good you know you don't want to put in
all these hours what I've learned is if
I'm gonna do this I want it to look
awesome and I want to be a hundred
percent satisfied with the result
because otherwise it just feels like it
was all done in vain like I just
worked countless hours and I'm not even
that happy with it so patience I think
is probably the key word there take your
time to do it right and if you mess up
spend the extra time to go back and fix
it because I think it's gonna really be
worth it in the end and provide some
much cleaner results also a fewer long
sprays I felt worked better than many
short sprays if that makes sense so
instead of like it was more like a shhh
that's probably the best way I could
demonstrate it right now when you're
just going all the way across with one
long spray it just allows you to coat
everything in that path as opposed to
when I was doing shorter sprays which I
thought would actually be more effective
I learned that I was getting little hot
spots and it was running a little bit in
certain areas that I'd sprayed more of
so one even coat you know going at a
nice steady pace just going back and
forth once or twice really quick usually
does the trick and I think that's pretty
much it so guys if you enjoy this kind
of blog stuff bill blog I should say go
ahead and toss me a like on the video
and let me know what you think of my
hole you know today I learned thing at
the end because maybe I'll just sum up
every each of these bill blogs with what
I've learned from the experience because
a lot of this stuff like I said is new
to me so if you guys like hearing my
experience and hearing about what I've
learned from and what I've taken away
from these these endeavors let me know
in the comments and I'll keep doing it
because it's a lot of fun and stuff like
that so thank you guys for watching
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already stay tuned for more videos
coming really soon in particular that
gtx 980ti unboxing an interview and more
bill blogs soon to come thanks guys see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
