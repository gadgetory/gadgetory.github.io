channel so today I'm just going to say
it right off the bat is going to suck
monkey balls because I finally decided
to clean my room after Oh six months of
procrastinating and just letting things
pile up it's getting out of hand it's
been out of hand for a long time so I'm
finally Manning up and cleaning the damn
place you can see here this is my
component shelf this is just some of the
hardware that I have most of it actually
it goes all the way from the bottom to
the top it's reaching my ceiling now
it's a hmm
we've also got this corner of the room
which is just as awful it's a complete
disaster get just like I can just like
HMDs just hanging out by the AC I've got
just random system builds just some of
them are empty chassis some of them are
half built and just even random
components that haven't found their way
back to the box it's pretty horrendous
and then we've got the closet of course
there's three systems just right here
that are just taking up way too much
space you can just see like look what
the hell's that what's the hell even is
that that's just there's no excuse for
that and I've got of course empty boxes
up here I'd say 90% of these boxes are
empty but you can just see there's like
not even any space for you couldn't fit
couldn't fit a stick a gum up there I
mean you probably could it's an
expression
it's just insane oh there's the other
half of the closet of course again just
from the bottom all the way up to the
top yeah it's serious guys it's serious
so as you might have guessed the
material for today's video is going to
be a time-lapse of me cleaning the place
and I wish I could have given you guys a
bit more substance for today's video but
this really needs to get done and the
bright side is that once it is done I'll
have a bit more freedom and room to be
more productive for the videos that
follow
so I guess sit back and relax and I'll
just start where you even start with
something like this I guess from the
beginning
the
alright guys so two hours have gone by
and I've done quite a number on the room
so as you can see the shelf is looking
pretty good hold on let me go ahead and
justice for you
so the Shelf is looking good and it
feels much better you can see that
there's actually some ceiling space now
and then everything just looks a little
bit more organized and I shuffled some
of the stuff that was in the closet to
the bottom shelf there by the power
supply's this boxes that box should not
be there and then kind of cleaned up
some of the systems that were here now
I'm not quite done yet with these with
these rigs here some of these are fully
built others are partially assembled so
what I'm gonna have to do later probably
not going to have time to do it in this
video but I'm going to have to
eventually strip some of these systems
down or decide which ones I want to keep
intact and then put them in the
appropriate places but you're probably
wondering and asking yourself well how
did you get so much space Kyle where did
all the stuff go it looks like you got a
lot less stuff than you used to where
did it all go well it's kind of funny
that you asked that because I'm I am
still only about halfway done this is
all the other stuff that was just lying
around taking up space pretty much
behind me so now I have to find a spot
for everything here there's actually
even more stuff in the living room so
let me go ahead and
so phase one complete now we got to
finish wrapping things up here and
tidying up the rest of the place because
it's still pretty horrendous so on that
note back to the time-lapse
one
oh yeah so this is this is what was what
I was going for nice clean and tidy it's
not perfect but Oh - it's not perfect
but it's definitely a long way from what
it was at the beginning of this video
here's a look at the product shelf one
more time
run front of our bar / / / this this
corner is still the only one that's a
little bit a little bit not so easy on
the eyes just because it's a just a
bunch of crap still that's actually my
YouTube play button right there for 100k
you can see I've got a real nice place
for it here's a look at some of the
goodies on shelf number four got Maddie
Ram my CPU including that rosin swag so
here's a look at the graphics card and
motherboards shelf or at least one of
them I didn't actually box up all my
cards there's still a ridiculous Tower
of Pisa sort of thing going on here but
I use a lot of these cards pretty
frequently as well so easy access can't
hurt
I did I did my best and I'm very happy
with the results so yeah I can continue
working now in in peace without the
anxiety of having a messy room it really
does make a difference guys when you're
trying to be creative and you have a
youtube channel and stuff to have a
clean space to work in so really happy
that that we're at this point now so
really quick announcement I am currently
searching for a off-site studio to move
all the stuff that I just reorganized
into so the hunt is on
I already looked at a few places with
whyphy sauce she's actually the one
that's been coordinating and scheduling
the viewing appointments and stuff I
thought one that I really liked but the
soundproofing was awful and assisted
with a historical building with some of
them let us do any modifications like
the windows or anything like that so the
hunt continues but I'm just going to
drop that little negative information
and update you guys on what's going on
with that so thank you for more updates
and you know it's making in a month or
two I may not even be here so why the
hell why the hell I even clean it today
whatever doesn't matter you guys are
great love y'all have a great day you're
a great night
and I will see you guys very shortly in
the next
all right there we go that was easy
I took like five seconds why didn't I do
that sooner whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
