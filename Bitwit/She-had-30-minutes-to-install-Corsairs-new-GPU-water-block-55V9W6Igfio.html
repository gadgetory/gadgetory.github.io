you were born ready for this so so we're
basically gonna install Corsairs new XG
water block onto a Founders edition r-tx
2080 and I'm gonna make my wife do it
because you know I've been working extra
hard I deserve a break I think I deserve
this so yeah of course and you know how
to operate a screwdriver come on how
many how hard could it be all right and
they're saying that this is supposed to
be a more seamless integration and
installation than existing water blocks
on the market so I think this is good
you know you've actually never installed
the water block in your life so what
what better proof of performance then
then right now so all right go ahead
first first step you you got to remove
the this is a lousy air cooler on here
there's a lousy backplate just asking to
be upgraded all right so remember we're
on a time crunch here because in about
30 minutes or so we're gonna have a
whole group of Chinese press walks
straight through that door and
completely obliterate this video so we
are this is a ticking time bomb right
now not to put any pressure on you but
you better you better hurry hurry your
ass up this is actually probably the
longest part of the process is has
nothing to do with the actual crosshair
block but just removing the stock cooler
from our r-tx 2080s II is is a bit on
the tedious side now while she's doing
that I'm gonna just briefly talk about
this so they actually have pre installed
thermal pads which is probably the
second most time-consuming parts of GPU
water block installation but having them
all pre applied like this definitely
saves you a chunk of time there's also a
nice little cover here for a pre applied
thermal paste very nice it that's pre
applied because there's so many
different schools of thought on the best
way to apply thermal paste so it's kind
of nice that they've already taken care
of that for you all so if you'll just
look at the design of the block itself
kind of have like a Dominator look right
here on the unenlightened outlet ports
this is a extruded aluminum it's very
nice to the touch kind of a matte black
finish are you done go ahead and yes
carefully remove it making sure not to
damage anything now this is super
fragile one wrong step you could
completely damage the $700 GPU that's
just beneath it might be a little into a
little sticky oh there it is you got it
beautiful oh wait are there more hex
screws under here yes there are okay so
now we need to find a hex
yeah cue jeopardy music so now alright I
think you got all the screws off right
yeah I don't hold this off right no yeah
you can't you should be you should be
able to pull the shroud off now from the
PCB separate the - you know you just
gotta be you gotta show who's boss
alright oh you broke it just kidding I
just want to give you a quick little
heart flutter there you're good so go
ahead and take that all the way off go
ahead and unplug that yep
from the PCB side it just should
disconnect now there it is now we don't
need him anymore and now we can finally
install this guy so that was about
roughly 12 minutes to adjust get the
stock founders Edition block off of
there are not blocked but air cooler and
now we're gonna see how long it actually
takes wifey to install the x-gene okay
so here we have some cabling for the RGB
LEDs that are on board and she's gonna
make sure to unzip tie those pop that
sucker off
you should probably first clean off the
the GPU but we actually have some
assistance at the moment which is very
helpful it's a dirty job but someone's
got to do it a you always might want to
make sure that you get the residual
thermal pad off of there and make sure
it's not gonna interfere with your fresh
new pads you definitely want to make
sure that these cables are routed around
in that that little groove there they
don't pinch them down when you connect
the block and then it's just a matter of
screwing it all back in kind of doing
the opposite of what you just did
alright so this is our sort of anomaly
screw here because it does need a nut on
the other side just to secure the
expansion slots to it alright just easy
does it
beautiful oh look at that mounting
technique and then it's just a matter of
screwing down but make sure you put the
the GPU backplate on first very cool
that this actually comes included with
the XP water block that's a huge bonus
at because these can be upwards of 40
bucks from competitors who we won't pain
yep there it is and sometimes what I
like to do is leave the screws just a
little bit loose that one you can
probably tighten but the other ones if
you want to leave a little loose just to
give a little bit of wiggle room for the
backplate in case you need to wiggle it
around for lining up with the other
mounting holes
2:43 plenty of time sue me what if you
put the screw in the screw hole first
and then do that okay that works you got
it but it looks like you're practically
done you have 1 2 3 more screws ok so on
on the recorder here it's been it's been
under 10 minutes
you basically installed this block in
about 8 minutes if you're if you're not
including the removal of the founders of
dition trout and there it is ladies and
gentleman wifey sauce good job I would I
would give you a round of applause yeah
ok so what did you think oh wow wow ok
it's good it's good I'm great I'm glad I
married an independent woman I mean it's
it definitely takes a lot of the
intimidation factor I think out of
custom water cooling something like this
is definitely a factor that I've heard a
lot of people talk about being scared of
when they're actually doing their first
liquid loot first custom loop but as you
see here folks even a wife could do it
thanks honey good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
