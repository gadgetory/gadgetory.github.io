alright guys so I've switched back to
wearing pants in my videos due to
popular demand I read your guys's
comments they're all very brutally
honest and truthful which I appreciate
100% because without your guys opinions
I would have no guidance or direction on
what to do for this channel so thank you
but let's move on to business shall we
today I've got an asus directs you to
GTX 670 to unbox so let's get down to it
alright guys I've taken a look at the
front of the box here we can that we see
a picture of the direct cu2 cooler it's
20% cooler and vastly quieter than the
reference design blower style fan and I
can definitely attest to that this is a
very quiet card and it stays extremely
cool even under full load while gaming
they've gone with the digi+ vrm design
using super alloy power so alder Bianca
poetry is si P or super L alloy power
and that's basically what they did was
they completely replaced all the
reference componentry vrm wise of the
reference card and replaced it with Si P
and that's basically an allow for more
consistent power delivery and what that
means is well when the video card guides
you know it's constantly going from hot
to cold hot to cold and that fluctuation
of temperature basically decreases the
lifespan of your card over time so with
a more consistent power delivery you're
gonna basically expand the life the
lifespan of your card so ACS is a good
job to ensure that you are gonna hold on
to this sucker for as long as you
possibly can
also included is GPU tweak that's ACS's
monitoring system and real time tweaking
so you can basically do real-time
overclocking from your OS with GPU tweak
comes with two gigs of DDR 5 memory and
this is a clocked at six thousand eight
megahertz and it is a 256-bit memory
interface it's PCIe gen3 so that's
double the bandwidth that you get from
PCI agent 2 or 2.1 and on the back here
basically a lot of the stuff I already
went over the super alloy power
component tree GPU tweak by the way guys
this card does have a base clock of 915
megahertz and a boost clock of 980
megahertz but if you guys are aware of
invidious GPU boost you know that
depending on the thermal conditions you
can actually get a much higher boost
clock than what the manufacturers stated
on the box so I've actually seen in my
personal experience this card get over 1
gigahertz when I'm gaming and that's
pretty awesome
alright so take a look inside here
you've got a box within a box I've got
some documentation here nice foam
packaging as if you had this card chips
or going to have a chipped rest assure
that oh your hardware inside is gonna be
safe protected yeah inside give some
accessories this is a molex double molex
to PCIe connector so if your power
supply is run out unfortunately of PCIe
connectors you can always power up your
card with a molex connector but there's
only one I believe this card has two
6-pin PCI Express connectors so you're
gonna need another one of these if you
were completely out of PCIe connectors
on your power supply but they've
included one for you all right there and
then we've also got speed setup Quick
Start Guide let's speed setup but it's a
lot of pages here colored diagrams
though full-color look at that oh it's
it's thick because there's multiple
languages so that's useful that's pretty
much it
oh you know what I actually there's
another accessory in here that should
have been in that thin box and here is
your GPU tweak and driver CD like I said
I always throw that away and go to the
website get the latest drivers and here
take that yet have a look that's how it
comes i repackage this because this is
my personal card by the way that I use
at home in my personal rig for mainly
for gaming and video editing so I kind
of repackaged it it doesn't look this
crappy when you get it so I don't worry
about that this is just me doing a
careful job of boxing hey I'm a nun
boxer guys I'm not I didn't say I was a
boxer so don't hold me accountable
here's the card itself look at how
beautiful it is it's nice right
good get a nice close-up look alright so
here we've got two eighty eighty
millimeter fans and they're right above
the fit assembly so you've got a big
heat sink underneath there and it's
basically just gonna disperse all the
heat that's being sucked up through the
copper piping here and drawn away from
the core of your GPU and speaking of the
piping we've got 3d pipes let's take a
look at it like this we've got three
copper pipes here and there
they're completely copper but they look
silver because they're actually
nickel-plated and that basically just
helps to minimize oxidation but if I
were to take this card apart and dissect
it you would actually see that the part
of the copper piping that's touching the
GPU is actually not nickel plated it's
it's it's actually just the raw copper
material and that's just to help with
thermal conductivity it's more
conductive that way and it's going to
help you disperse more heat from your
GPU moving on we've got just another
look at the shroud there it's a nice
shroud it's a very open shroud so
youryour airflow is going to be just
dispersed through all sides of this card
and a little bit out the back there's
some ventilation there you've got your
PCIe connector there and you've also got
your SLI fingers you've got two sli
fingers here feel free to SLI this card
all you want yeah and taking a look at
the rear i/o you've got a two DVI to DVI
ports right there you've also got a
DisplayPort and HDMI out and you can do
up to four displays simultaneously with
this card guys so you can actually gain
with three if you want to do like a
triple monitor Nvidia surround vision
surround you can do that and you could
have a fourth companion monitor where
you have like your VoIP or your you know
web browsing or whatever else you want
but four monitors simultaneously guys
with one card that's pretty impressive
aside from that we can go to the back
here excuse has included a very nice
sleek looking back play on this card and
it's a it's got the AC sled go there and
GeForce GTX 670 easily identifiable from
the outside of your case especially if
you have like a side case window side
panel window and there's only four
screws to undo it if you want to do like
water cooling or something there's two
here two there you just unscrew those
and the whole backplate pops off and
this right here this is just like some
this is a poss cap these are your poss
caps capacitors and it's as you can see
it's located directly behind the GPU
itself and it's gonna allow for
immediate power delivery a lot of
competitors have their post caps located
far away from the GPU and it actually
takes a longer time
to deliver that power when it when it's
actually needed right away so they call
that back-to-back configuration I
believe is what they call it so that's
pretty cool it's cool stuff and this is
basically a brushed aluminum finish by
the way this entire backplate and it's
also supposed to aid in card sag GPU sag
so when you actually mount it in your
case it doesn't sag to one end
I own this card like I said and I can't
really say it completely corrects the
issue my card still sags a little bit
but not terribly much it's just because
it's kind of a heavy car it's got a lot
of metal in its sturdy construction but
it definitely doesn't make the card look
a lot nicer when it's in your case oh
and I almost forgot to point out there's
your two 6-pin PCI II connectors right
there powering the card and I think the
the max power consumption that you you
draw from this card is about 225 watts
give or take so a very very power
efficient card the GK 104 is the name of
the actual GPU that this card is running
very impressive stuff one last thing
guys really quick I wanted to show you
what the card looks like inside of my
case this is a 600 T it's a pretty big
mid Tower especially for a mid tower
case it's pretty huge and there's a cat
in the way come on boy let go all right
but yeah it's I forgot to mention also
the card is about ten and a half inches
so keep that in mind when picking apart
this part out for your build that's the
card you're gonna go for make sure it
fits Jesus freaking cats man but there
you have it I don't know if you can
really tell she'd probably try to put
this on like a tripod but there's a
little bit of a sag right there as I
mentioned earlier it's very slight
though guys it's it's nothing to be
alarmed of it doesn't affect performance
at all so you shouldn't mind it alright
guys well that's going to do it for this
video that's all I have to say about the
Asus direct cu2 GTX 670 GPU and if you
guys enjoyed this video like share with
your friends if they're interested in
getting the video card and this is Ron
the price range I highly recommend it
this is my own personal card and I
absolutely loved it every single every
single second abusing it so I thank you
all for watching subscribe if you
haven't already I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
