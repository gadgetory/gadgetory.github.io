you have missed part one go head over to
pels segment it's paul's hardware that's
his youtube channel yes part one is on
paul's hardware that's right go check
that out and then come back here and
watch the segment or you can watch this
you you watch them out of order yes I
talked a lot about a lot of stuff in the
first half that you're going to need to
know for the second half yes so you
should really you should really watch
every absolutely so uh guys welcome back
to the show if you are just joining us
also welcome we have a good show for you
guys today and we're going to continue
that right now so first off my first
segment is going to be continuation of
paul's which is the many announcements
oh yes okay for those of you for those
of you hated to start your show the past
couple weeks i know i'm just being so
ahead of myself I appreciate all right
so for those of you who missed it and
are just joining us I'm doing a new
segment on here called pit my pc which
is an obligatory ripoff of the pimp my
setup segment that matt philly does on
his own channel twitch dot I'm sorry
youtube.com slash swashing TV go ahead
and check him out of the arashi but he
has such a great idea for a show that I
just couldn't help but let me lappy it
and just totally steal it take it where
I basically will take you get your
guys's pictures of your PC's of your
desktops and Paul and I will kind of
just look at them and tell you how you
can improve upon your personal rigs so
since kyle is doing this show now Matt's
unable to do pimp my setup anymore so
our apologies for that but trust me this
show here is going to be totally totally
worth that trade-off I don't think
that's absolutely true that the license
moved over T not a trance Errol your
name know about that anyway favorite
paper works the way if you guys would
like to participate personally in this
segment of mine that's coming up later
on the show go ahead and tweet me
pictures of your system at my twitter
handle is at forever a kyle and make
sure that your side panel is off of your
case so that we can actually see the
insides of it and and give you some more
feedback that way so go ahead and tweet
me those pictures guys but let's move on
to my first segment which is tech news
first off I don't know you've probably
heard about this Paul I think everyone's
heard about this at some point this week
gigabyte overtakes asus as the largest
motherboard vendor
which now what is citing I did see this
yeah I read articles yeah no I didn't
read articles I read headlines oh okay
what did what are they using to quantify
biggest what is biggest biggest
essentially means in this case that one
vendor has shipped more motherboards in
the first quarter event another so they
looking at quantity of mother looking at
UNT of motherboard ship which is an
indication of sales as well and and and
to clarify there's different ways of
quantifying like companies when you're
comparing one to the other we have come
specifically or units sold or anything
like that so asus overall is still
massive no yeah huge when you look at
the amount of stuff that asus does when
it comes not just to motherboards which
they do a great job on laptops laptops
but in all those finished goods there's
lots of stuff that they dabble and
gigabyte as well yeah as a whole range
of stuff and actually that's that's a
fun thing about going to CES as you see
the stuff that gigabyte like can't sell
in the US right like i was at CES and
they had a lamp it was a lampstand
remember that do you member this I don't
remember morning so I was a little lamp
stand right okay little bass like that
and it just had a USB plug that you plug
into your laptop and the lampstand had
an optical drive in it and like a USB
hub and a card reader that's pretty
awesome like this suite is it's like a
lamp and you sit it on your desk this is
just one for USB into your laptop and
then you have an optical drive if you
have like a slim thing and I was like
why this is this is cool I've never
known allowed to be that useful yeah but
it's not sold in the US no only only
like the Eastern culture thinks of these
awesome things you know I don't share
them with us or stupid Americans that's
why we have to take national beer day
for ourselves that's right by the way
its national beer day everyone could it
also be much more tequila day kyle is
switched to tequila we were out of beer
you have a beer out of usable beer okay
I have to save the rest he's saving the
rest for Coachella this right hand all
right but I'm cheers Cheers yeah okay
now you have to count on that damn it
yeah mmm slow but surely all right so
continuing on with this little segment
here so gigabyte if you want to know the
pure numbers they shipped 4.8
million motherboards in the first
quarter of this year well asus or issues
tech shipped about 4.5 million so
they're about point three million up on
Asus those gigabyte errs um and that's
that's pretty good i'm gonna make that a
think about your gigabyte us yeah just
you know improvin but both of them sadly
we are still quite short of their 20
million units units shipped annually so
each of them have a quota of 20 million
that's that's their goal is to ship 20
million motherboards per year so at 4.5
and 4.8 million i mean they should be
making at least five million per quarter
to meet to meet that goal so there's a
couple reasons for this right i mean
there hasn't been as much of a demand
for pcs in the pc market for the first
quarter hopefully we're gonna see that
start to pick up in the second and third
quarters especially with like Black
Friday and and the holidays of course
everything kind of just goes up in
general for most markets that way but
it's been a little bit slow in this
first quarter which is understandable
but both game by 10 acs are still I
don't say light years but they are far
ahead of their competitors like asrock
and msi for example just in terms of
motherboards all right we're just
talking about the boards here so as rock
and msi are trailing behind at about 1.4
to 1.6 million units shipped um it are
you talking about quality of product
you're just talking about units we're
just talking about units sold but you
should clarify that yeah whoa do you
ever want to get sampled anything from
msi you should clear no yeah of course
of course of course this is only newest
sales it's just number of units shipped
Hey look they have a picture of the msi
GTA titan sli i think i'm doing a video
on that pretty soon well that will be a
fascinating video k sighs just a teaser
so well Oh actually why do they have
that here but oh because all there isn't
a shin of msi know this this brings up a
good point is that companies like asrock
and msi who are trailing behind in the
motherboard department are looking for
new avenues to branch into besides
motherboards themselves so as right for
example is they're turning to enterprise
oriented solutions and msi is you just
saw why why is that picture there it's
because they're also branching out into
the gaming notebook business that you're
gonna say like hi
fashion because I think that's somewhere
that asrock should go with their
products high fashion yes I'd like to
see an asrock like display at Paris
Fashion Week yeah that would be cool
anyway anyway that's some some some
interesting concepts no debate yes great
job that bet basically that's what this
story is congrats again mites and I
think so wet think when you look at
something like this like what it comes
down to cos look for some reason when I
when you first started talking about
this story i was reminded very very much
of a sir right now because acer is like
they move more monitors than anyone yeah
and it's not very well known that acer
is like I think they are the biggest
volume I could be wrong here so sorry if
I'm wrong but I know they're at least
very very high up there right as far as
the biggest volume seller of monitors
right but it's because ASA really got
that market that people spend a lot of
money in yeah and not not like big
dollars but lots of people spend smaller
amounts of money yes like you can go you
could buy an acer 1080 you know decent
20 25 bucks or something like that and
that's really where they kind of
captured that market right I think
that's where gigabyte actually has a lot
of a lot going on for them to say the
higher end offerings there's anything
wrong with them at all like they make
great motherboards all through the stack
yeah but when you look at like a what is
this one the z97 pd3 you know a z97
board that does everything you want it
to do that has no extra bells and
whistles that is rock solid and is
inexpensive 120 bucks or something like
that I have no idea how much this
actually cost but that's what I'm
talking about it's like if it has no one
is yet you're looking at that value
propositions proposition of gets the job
done right is reliable and you know
doesn't cost a ton of money and yeah I
think that's where gigabyte has done
well especially over this past year yep
absolutely and then you know I've been
personally happy with gigabyte boards
I've got one of my test bed right now
I've got the the ud for p @ x 99 and
that's been doing really well as far as
the one behind Paul right now which is
my daily driver for all my editing stuff
I've got the X
9 gaming Wi-Fi g1 at the games you one
Wi-Fi which is they're both excellent
boards had to update the bios and stuff
but got it working quite easily so
gigabyte is definitely killing it right
now and obviously the numbers show that
apart from that i will say that that's
all i have to say that there's nothing
apart from that i would also like to add
nothing not zero additional things so
moving on congratulations gigabyte so
Stanford creates an aluminum phone
battery that charges in one minute what
those Stanford guys I tell you they are
on intelligent crack or something this
is overrun maximum pc by the way that
last story was from hex is that yes
thank you so similar aluminum batteries
in the past have have shown to die after
the first 100 cycles of charging which
is not consumer friendly you can't just
have a smartphone that only you get to
charge 100 times before it completely
taps out on you but these ones can
withstand over 7500 cycles without any
loss of capacity which is actually a lot
more than typical lithium ion batteries
which can only handle about a thousand
cycles which is why after having to this
phone for two years i have to charge it
almost once a day even when i don't use
it that much so it has a very limited
number of cycles compared to this new
aluminum how much of an impact do the
purple gloves have on the batteries
ability to charge quickly oh this blue
gloves too I hear I hear the purple
gloves actually give you higher recharge
ability than the blue ones I like the
purple gloves yeah we gotta go circle
okay but it could be bad color
correcting in the video I'm not sure uh
but there are certain besides besides
having more which we call it more more
life cycles to more recharge cycles then
their lithium-ion counterparts they're
also a number of other features that
aluminum ion cells have over there lie I
on brethren I should say including they
are cheaper like aluminum ion cells are
just a lot more cheap than than lie I on
so I don't I say keep saying like I on
reading it lithium ion batteries
additionally they're not as flammable
which is good if you
have like kids and stuff you want them
to catch on fire I guess most people
these days aren't saving the kids on
fire like they don't explode people they
don't explode or catch on fire when
their punctured like lithium ion their
higher capacity which we've already
talked about and they're flexible which
kind of introduces some you know maybe
futuristic ideas about what batteries
are going to be like living down the
road um but the prototype that
Stanford's produced days I'll yes
apparently we're having some major audio
sync issues and there are lots of
requests to restart the stream you
always sabotage my part well I did it
intentionally but I think it might I
don't like you okay let's let's try a
retiree about they then Rebecca 1020 130
400 and we're back and we're back
hopefully it's working now guys let us
know if the audio video sink is ok if
it's not we'll try troubleshooting it a
bit more but the show must go on so um
until we hear further notification from
you guys I'm just going to continue on
where we left off which was on this
aluminum phone battery thing that can
charge in under a minute which is pretty
impressive what I was saying earlier is
that the the prototype that Stanford's
produced for this aluminum ion battery
has about half the voltage of a standard
lithium ion battery which isn't very
promising but the folk was good now by
the way good I'll thanks everyone but
the folks behind this this new battery
type says that it's simply a matter of
improving the cathode material of the
battery now this is very technical and I
don't know the ins and outs of battery
facilitation and like that but the
challenge is finding materials that can
produce enough voltage after multiple
charge and discharge cycles and actually
it's kind of interesting because
Stanford accidentally discovered that
using graphite which is essentially
carbon offered really good performance
over other materials they discovered
accidentally I love accidental
discoveries me too so I think Corsair
should create a power supply in their
graphite series that uses graphite that
would be a good selling point anyway
this as long as they continue to improve
this cathode material on this could
potentially mean a future battery for
smartphones that doesn't suck that you
don't have to
four or five hours to charge and that'll
that'll last you quite a bit longer
that's it looks like it that's like a
sea change like that's freaking huge
like yeah it is huge it is really huge
adding that everything falls that falls
into the category yeah of things that I
used to do 20 years ago that were
regular normal everyday things that will
just be gone like my regular thing right
now is when I go to bed i plug in my
phone yep and when I get up in the
morning it's charged yeah like and who
knows maybe I'll still do that just cuz
it's normal or whatever but like to
charge your phone like how quick in a
minute and have in a freaking minute a
minute that's brilliant yeah yeah even
it half the voltage of a lithium-ion
battery you're still talking okay maybe
that's fifty percent voltage but that's
thousands upon thousands of percent
better charge time so as long as they
can keep revising the the cathode
material that's used to to create these
batteries and to sustain the life cycles
in them they can potentially increase
the voltage with future revisions and
still maintain a one minute charge time
that'd be awesome which is pretty great
a battery improvements is one of the
things that's like it has so much
potential yes not just for like
convenience of things like like cell
phones that sort of thing the right
comes like transportation and look cars
vehicle think it has a lot of potential
because it's so limited like we're
always so limited by battery yeah so
seeing vast improvements in that is
really quite exciting but moving out of
the next story the rocket our friends at
roccat or rocket rocket our friends our
rockets are coming out with their candy
roccat from you used to call it roccat
that's before head but let's anti-party
got that from you before I met the CEO
he's like just call it rock that's like
Uncle you see you broke it we walked to
their booth at CES no topic takes two
and a half years ago I didn't exist it
back on he was really cool I was I
remember it's very nice guy i was i was
a held captive in the hotel room editing
videos oh yeah hours on end yeah i'm
excited about that so rocket is coming
out with their new cave xtd 5.1 analog
surround headset know which is pretty
cool this is the successor to the OG
cave that they came out with not too
long ago but its twenty five percent
lighter it's got a dual-mode remote so
you can switch between stereo and 5.1
surround when you're getting into the
nitty-gritty gaming experience or you're
just watching some movies you want that
more immersive sound sound level it's
interesting angle on that picture it is
kind of unique red because the
microphones pointed the other way but I
think maybe they're just showing I
design it makes the can see what you
huge right like which I'm not opposed to
like you'd look like Princess Leia which
I'm not opposed to because I'm I don't
care how big or goofy they look because
of them using them at home no one's
gonna see me anyway okay and as long as
they're like I said they're twenty-five
percent lighter than the original cage
which I believe we're already pretty
like to begin with so the fact that
they're twenty-five percent lighter is a
good sign that means they're going to be
more comfortable potentially and you'll
be able to wear them for longer periods
of time the microphone also has an LED
tip on it which lights up every time you
speak into it so it tells you when the
microphones active or muted which is
kind of a nice visual indication to just
see if your if your mics on I've never
seen a bird of that before yeah and I'm
very interested how useful that would be
I mean you I mean I can see if your mics
you know you if it's a flex mic which it
looks like it is you could potentially
just look down and see that your oh my
mic sliding up were you able to tell how
you need it like is there I think it's
probably a in line it's probably an
inline as an inline switch probably an
inline switch yeah don't quote me on
that but that's probably one guess we
are to see like how well you can see
that in your peripheral vision like a
light on it well I mean you might just
have to go you might have to like peel
it back a little bit if it's flexible
and stuff I mean I can usually see my
mod Mike when I'm when I'm gaming is and
what not actually no I've decided that I
like it and I want this I'll use it
while streaming and then when your
street we see the way I'm on you busy
this sounds like a little light pops up
yeah in front of your face every time
you talk yeah i think it's a it's
interactive it's a cool missoula
stimulating right so like visual
stimulation exactly it additionally it's
got 40 millimeter drivers on both ends
align precisely at a 12 degree angle to
match the natural form of your ear so I
guess maybe the way the driver is
oriented can affect how how clear it's
coming into your ear
or maybe just how evenly it's it's a the
sound ism is entering your ear yeah um
you know they're getting pretty
technical here at this point but it also
features 30 millimeter vibration drivers
which I asked you earlier around those
are those are I mean a vibrating
headphone so maybe this just means that
they can vibrate you know when the
subwoofer maybe is like is being blasted
out or when there's you know extreme
frequencies of certain type that are
higher decibel than others maybe a
vibration occurs and that gives you a
bit more like feel of motion or or some
kind of immersion i'm not sure but some
haptic feedback yeah that's the case I
hope there's an off switch because I
don't think everyone will be into that
yeah I don't know if I would want by
brandy and only thing like that you need
to be able to turn off yes I mean it's
not always practical to I mean you might
write you might like it but in certain
situations you can have your headphones
vibrating exactly what if your listen to
your ipod with this thing yeah what if
you don't want you know Taylor Swift to
be vibrating your ears while you're
listening to her hit single what if
you're replying on that I do it if
you're reclining against the pile of
like sleeping puppies with your
headphones on that's another use case
scenario breathe a very common they
could wake up wake up the puppies I deal
with this on it on the daily so
hopefully that's something that's
something that I think headphone
manufactures for jobs that are
absolutely can uh this is the first
analog headset of its kind of feature an
interference isolator 40 noise
essentially that gives you zero
electromagnetic interference from other
devices that's good um so that's cool
that's the first of its kind for an
analog headset it's also get an inline
remote which allows you to adjust the
various parameters of 5.1 surround
individually and independently so you
can control the volume of your Center
left right and subwoofer independently
of each other with his in line I do love
vibrant rollers yes vibrating things are
always good that was pointed out in chat
yeah yeah but I mean this is kind of
cool that they're coming out with 5.1
analog as opposed to digital I know a
lot of people are you know on the on the
analog bandwagon as opposed to USB
digital especially when it comes to
something like this depends where your
source is coming from yes it does cuz
yeah I mean I on the music it depends on
the game quality yeah and most people
when it comes down to it what I feel
like you know we get to the hairy I want
analog because they want to have their
own source set up and usually the source
will end up with an analog output
ranking just need a hand headphones in
order to achieve that yeah I kind of
wonder how these will fall in line
against the the Kingston's the the
clouds yeah so the Kingston's our
digital to their digital 5.1 analog from
from everything I can see there they're
pretty much on par with each other okay
I think these are a bit more pricey
they're due out mid-april for about 120
bucks which I believe you can get the
Kingston ones for a hundred now yeah the
new HyperX cloud to Suzy so these are
going to need to show some improvement
or some significant features that
differentiate them from the HyperX cloud
tues because right well if you look at
headsets that have come out I think in
the past your year to you think the
cloud tues I think are killing it yeah
they're they're widely accepted by a lot
of reviewers to be you know if you're
looking at headsets and you're not
looking at like hirens headphones like
likes to do skype type stuff you know
the one thing that might sell me on a
rocket cave over a cloud to HyperX cloud
to excuse me is the microphone if the
microphone is killer on this cave on
this headset then i might justify the
extra 20 bucks because that's like i
think half of a headset that's what
makes it a headset not headphones is the
microphone if you're doing VoIP and
and you're chatting a lot in game then
the microphone is very important it's a
lot of something that a lot of vendors
overlook they're like well we'll just
slap a microphone shitty two-dollar
microphone in there and we'll brand it
as a headset yeah but that's literally
half of what us gamers are looking for
in a headset is good quality mic and the
cloud to as amazing as the sound is for
a hundred bucks it really does have a
really good sound with all the tests
that I did with it the microphone isn't
that hot it's just it's just a kind of a
crap biking in my in my personal opinion
so if you know for an extra twenty
dollars you can get the the rocket cave
and it has a killer Mike I would say go
for it and all the other things I feel
are a bit gimmicky like the I don't know
being able to control the like or the
interference isolator 40 noise I mean I
don't really deal with lexter
electrostatic frequency interference
on the reg you know what with any of the
headsets that i use currently so I mean
that might be like some kind of excuse
for a markup you know some marketing
markup but i don't know i think i think
it boils down to the mic like you said
it the cloud 2 is a viable option so
it's going to boil down for me
personally it's going to boil down to
house the mic sound so and a number
thats quite a bit of speculation you're
completely you're just accepting that
these are gonna have really good sound
no i'm saying if it's on par with
everything sounds is on part of them
yeah exactly okay break it because i
mean the the cloud tues have 50
millimeter drivers which aren't going to
be we're going to be just marginally
better sounding than the 40 mil millon
millimeter drivers on this so it boils
down to the mic for me so I think I
think Matt's in chat and I don't know
what he's talking about Matt Philly Oh
splashing AO time and he said he's
contacting people and I don't know what
he's talking about he might just be
responded somebody in chat I don't know
if he's trying to hold us Oh what's
what's going on that I think he said he
said we can't he said you can't do your
segment anymore no I sees cutting it out
I spoke with him earlier he said it was
really not a lot about it was like I
don't want you guys ripping off my my
 no Mets Mets a cool guy I you know
it's his intellectual property you think
he's gonna file a patent lawsuit against
this actually just loop it in with
the millions samsung all right so that's
pretty much all i have to say about the
rocket cave be sure to look out for it
mid april four hundred twenty bucks and
now it's on to our next segment which is
not pin my pc sorry not know if the
stage I that you're gonna wait a little
bit longer if I do the next one after
this we're doing face off we're gonna
face off yeah that's the game y'all love
it's the one that Paul loves to lose at
I always lose where you go ahead to head
and play it online crappy online
two-player game and the loser has to do
something stupid and you guys just let
us know in the chat what you would like
used to do having predetermined what
they know I like the crowd source aspect
of it you know then you should a
crowdsourced it at the beginning like
you're doing with your mat Philly ripoff
these guys are good and these guys are
good at coming up with ideas left and
right you wishing they don't need extra
time but to take a picture and tweet it
you know they have to take their side
seven years out of Vegas and you're
gonna gain
and you're like hey I'm gonna gamble
yeah and you go up to a table and you're
like I want to gamble like how much
money do you want a gambling I don't
care you're just like I don't care i'll
gamble whatever here's my wallet
whatever's in there like you just don't
you know why you to determine what the
what the repercussions are anything like
that somehow in Vegas I'm more coherent
than I am on the show so no I just you
have true is not in a row as tell you
should have not be wise you should not
be lying dude ever see me in Vegas yeah
I apologize for Kyle like your appalling
and I machine by something it's a kid
okay alright so let's agree let's get on
with the show here we're gonna play some
soccer physics this is another terrible
game that I found actually is a
reasonable one Sharpie glasses sure yeah
I know I pointed that out earlier I
think it's great you know you would look
really good with a can't you're already
wearing them I have to film tomorrow
norwell come off look I'm ready Sharpie
less this way all rights bring the
keyboard over here do we even know how
to control this yes there's an up arrow
and a w alright so this is low one
little button yep I didn't do well at
the one button game last time it's very
say I have W and I have up also love
arrow you should show people at the
hills million yes show them fall this is
soccer physics show them now this is
soccer fish so we're playing soccer with
physics that's all this is that in all
this game is that is the entire
introduction yep and two players until I
really ok this one alright so you're on
the left I'm on the right I saw fit
button to somehow control your team it
really says to sign i love this i love
the instruction to love it already all
right ready hey sure let's play first of
three all right let's go Edward last ten
all right where's the ball oh no there
we go ah look at that look at that no
name no get in there
uh user head I'm daddy's my head what
are you you David Beckham get a freakin
gold know oh yeah block it why am I go
in the room oh you can't go forward look
at these in my head this is silly use
your head Paul use your head oh thank
you happen do did you see that headshot
though look at a soccer headshot oh we
got a beach ball each fall babe I'm not
play anymore busy route this doesn't
count what are you doesn't count mr.
baby fine I'll give that one to you cuz
it feel sorry for you no please go to go
why can't I go hey why don't you go okay
all rights 121 that cuz that one that
didn't count okay fine I wasn't looking
oh oh my god i want to instant replay on
it you see that that literally went
between both interpreters at the same
time hey you lose awesome already stupid
game are we done no you said vested oh
we need to win through now remember I
gave you one I gave you one so the first
person with three wins so it's too okay
so as I wanted to yes ah showers side up
all right up please move back Barney
total oqy execute launch across the
entire Matt all right oh just just
 I think once once you go pass the
ball just headed the ball back into my
own goal Wow ah I need to already and
that concludes this segment of face off
yes yes we also go ahead we really need
to play like masterpiece theatre music
or something like i'm old on this
segment okay some people are saying you
should strip down naked yeah you can
shave your head
you should delete your YouTube channel
yeah yeah whatever people have about how
good I am yeah and we have this we have
this moment of the bag is so exciting
now so anti climactic alright well we'll
think of something for for Paul to do
this is the traditional way that the
faceoff goes is you only ten dollars i
like that ten bucks yeah yeah all right
you'll just buy lunch next time hello
look on the next episode kits rooster
hey Brewster hey rooster thanks for
stepping in hope you're not too cooked
up you forgot about our show yeah uh so
just to prove to the fans I think that
you paid your dues for this for this
huge huge failure on your part yeah I
think I should eat part of the lunch on
next episode of blossom hardware eat
part of the lunch be part of the lunch
that you buy me because you owe me lunch
you owe me lunch next week on the nose
less though now yes this is a monetary
well it was ten dollars i just i would
like lunch I see so bring woman in that
case that means you would have to show
up next week well I mean even if it's
you know GTA day and we just do GTA I
still want to be fed that's fine well
I'll do that oh I'll Drive you how do
you how that I can do you can buy me
like you know stagers okay Billy well
that's all for face off yeah Toki fifth
yeah joyed face-up game I don't think
you all right for the record I don't
think you've ever won now I have a
segment we're on episode 8 now yeah and
we've probably done at least 60 views
clearly you've clearly chosen a game
every time that you well here's the
thing so when I take a game for face off
like a half I have to play it first just
to make sure that it's playable yeah
because saw these games I find are not
playable they don't not really always
has an advantage going into it it's
really it's not really an advantage
because I'm playing both characters you
know I don't even know if the hell I'm
doing I'm just making sure that the
buttons work yeah and i'm like i can
clearly be Paul this game no Chrome well
Johnson just like I always say all right
32 notifications here Kyle alright so
now let's move on to the segment that
I've been hyping up since the beginning
of
today's stream which is the pin my pc
segment in obligatory awesome hardware
rip off of Matt phillies pimp my setup
which you guys can find on youtube.com
slash swashing TV SWA shi NTV I can
spell Johnson yeah go ahead and check
him out he's got a great show going on
there I was a special guest on his show
earlier this week Paul was a special
guest a few weeks before that he's got a
lot of huge people on his show including
Linus and I think he's got our friend
sergeant ballistic me well and I said
you okay I said you didn't group him now
being group me with the huge people
you're not you ain't there yet good it
was gotta pay your dues son tran anyway
go check out Matt Phillies channel pin
my setup isn't awesome awesome a bit
that he does but it's so awesome that we
decided to steal it so we're gonna do
what's called pimp my pc where you guys
send in pictures to me and paul and we
go ahead and not only rate them but just
give you guys tips on how to improve the
look and overall feel of your pc whether
it's tidy the cable management up or you
know color coordinate some things here
and there whatever it may be you guys we
give you guys some feedback personally
something from us are you some of them
are really impressive well and i kind of
expected that because not everyone's me
like I'm gonna send the picture of my
shitty spc a lot of them are like go out
awesome please say let's see what kind
of critiques they can make on me a lot
of people do that is Matt though a lot
of people do that with that too look if
people sense that's true had I like why
would you send that picture I don't know
you know part of it's probably for the
walls but anyway let's let's start off
with the with some of these why don't
you just I'm going to task you with
picking out doing all the work we do
it'll work and then organic the bad guys
it's on my half of the show I'm on top
of that you're tall you're in control
you are in control and I'd be it'd be
awkward to reach over your body well
yeah and you know try to be kind of you
kind of control together see I'm such
soft hands I know right let's start off
with this one which was sent over okay
wait who sent this over and and by the
way
I want to try to get through four or
five of these it depends on how much
Paul and I elaborate and what how much
they're how much content there is to
talk its us from Aden fryer but we're
gonna try do four or five 8nf one two
three on Twitter okay this is an inert
album no 305 he's building that note
three or four three or four yeah that
you knew fractal products same uh
so here's here it is Josh make the
bigger let's see it I like the strict in
there the 970 strict I think it is it
looks really nice okay very clean
actually Betty management that's not to
a cooler yes wow that is pretty beefy
the least amount of clearance space I've
seen with the cooler in a system like
this like but I have gym and yet it fits
traded yeah I have to admire that he's
actually utilizing and most of the space
in the node 304 because i did a building
here in this case before and it didn't
use up nearly as much space which I felt
like it was kind of wasted on the case
yeah but here it's like you get really
good cooling because you have an awesome
knocked to a cooler in there and you're
actually maximizing your potential there
for this is a seven a seven hundred
sixty watt power supply okay of course
rx7 60 which i don't think is little
overkill on the power supply I mean
unless we don't know we don't really
know what the core components are here
true as far as i can tell i don't know
what what else is so so I mean this has
been my pc so what could he do what
could this person do to kind of fix
things up tidy things up a bit I mean
the first thing that comes to mind is
cable management could look a little
tidier I know it's difficult in the mini
ITX case but especially right here in
the picture that we're seeing I think
maybe tightening all of those up and
putting them into groups making kind of
one constant or just a few constant
streams of cables as opposed to kind of
like cable spaghetti I think what's
really nice and also helps things like
air flow because you have those too I
think they're 80 are they 80 millimeter
fans in there
120 neither 121 in the middle is big
it's it's larger than 120 dynamis the
circuit oh I'm sorry this this cooler
there's different configurations I
believe you can do with this cool i'm at
the front of the case well in front of
the case case fans I think there's 2
120's think it's a one or no that's a
148 different and then there's two in
the front right yeah there's two cases
there's two case not to fret the front
yeah looking at the back yeah there's
two there's two fans there whatever they
are I think that's 2 120's it's very
important in the node 304 that you have
good cable management because most of
those extra cables go right at the front
of that case where you have to your only
two intake fans right there so if you
have a bunch of bunched up cables and
they're not super nice and neat you can
be impeding a lot of airflow that would
otherwise be like what otherwise benefit
the noctua cooler that you have in there
as well as your your-your-your Strix gtx
970 so I would definitely like that in a
bit I'm just guessing okay I just call
it a 970 because it looks like it sounds
reason Tom but that would be my opinion
there's obviously no kind of window
aspect here so I'm not going to say like
throwing some what's an a7 sleeved
cables or anything like that but all in
all it is a very nice looking pc i don't
have a whole lot to add to be perfectly
honest when it comes to a system the
small i like that you're able to fit
that that entire big cooler in the front
yeah the ax 760 is a full fully modular
power supply that's the only question
that popped up into my head was would
there be some way to reduce the amount
of cables in there and I wasn't sure if
this is fully modular with egg 760 is
only modular and platinum Phoenix let's
platinum so um that's a nice build yeah
first first pic here and I can't I can't
really come up with too much that you
could do to like improve rad the other
things that I'm not sure up here like
what your situation with the Coulee on
the cpu yeah really i have no idea there
if it's a i mean it's got to be a low
profile or something going on in there
what the hell my talk about it's a good
script the noctua cooler what am I
talking about yeah I don't know I don't
know
first never mind i was gonna mention the
drives whatever drives might be in there
yeah he's got a hard you over there i
believe an SSD Drive Lance's teeth but
yeah I mean when it comes to working
with the case of small there's you know
there's not a whole lot you can do so
true thanks Bill all in all nice yeah I
could I like to yeah alright moving on
the next one okay got here let's let
stroma 0 mind and now no I don't want to
pick your setups guys we just want to
pimp your PC's because pimp your set pin
my setup is a completely different show
that has nothing to do with this one and
is completely different in every way
possible there are no similarities
between ours and Matt Philly show they
might but he sent a picture of his set
up to I know that's why i said that's
why i said don't don't do that so what
do you think he could do here I think
maybe his cable management could improve
no we're not supposed to copy it exactly
no different deaths is supposed to go
low profile people don't realize that
malaria is that we've actually ripped
off this entire I like those modern
isn't okay so let's talk about the
computer then that isn't x99 to looks
okay yes it is indeed you are a nice
can't we can't see anything here that I
like this going on I like how you have
the white court corsair fans up there on
your on your radiator I think that looks
really great with the Xin deluxe from
Asus um I also like the draft all the
drives up top I like that too i like how
you open up the airflow on the bottom of
the case just give you a bit more
healthy air flow to the video card is
this a define r4 or define our five it's
probably define our five because define
our for you couldn't do that okay yeah
that's a diviner got it then and I like
how he has another fan another 140 it
looks like on the bottom there I just
really love all the airflow it looks
like a really really cool literally a
cool case like everything is great good
good temp since the black and white
looks great it does um actually that
EVGA graphics card doesn't fit in as
well with everything else yeah it's a
little silver with the silver on the
side and there's not a whole lot of
other silver going on in the case the
also the hx750 I and power supply if
you're talking purely
aesthetics here the blue the blue
doesn't really match with the LEDs right
so those are like two things I think
aesthetically they kind of stick out to
me a little bit yeah I like what you did
with the drives put popping all the
drives at the top that's I wouldn't have
done with mine too is it does it make it
top heavy though this looks like it
would be really top heavy mmm because he
got well he's got three you got three
mechanical we go at the very top of the
case honestly I'm only I only have a
concern about that if he's moving the
case around a lot yeah it fits ding
stationaries I move much that's fine i
also like it's it's interesting that the
lower right here has so much open space
but it actually looks like a nice open
like air tunnel from the front for for
bringing but does stuff back it
definitely does and i don't know what
else you would do with that anyway what
up what I'm curious to know is why he
didn't use another corsair fan for the
exhaust on the back on the back be like
that would just match it you know he
doesn't get a buyer because you have to
buy those well yeah I mean what I mean
the I mean he does happen to the fan on
the bottom and the fam the back matching
but I feel like having that that white
rim around aesthetically speaking but
gonna brag i would guess that those are
Corsairs SP fans static pressure since
they're on a radiator oh yeah i'm just
i'm talking about their AF series but
actually the fan at the front right here
and the fan of the top left have white
rims and those are not fractal fans I
don't know where those fans come from no
I know I know I'm just I'm just thinking
maybe having all the same type of case
fan and radiator fan might bring the
theme together a bit more yeah but all
in all it's a very clean looking
building clean um I think this is also
like this is like there are certain
cases and certain builds where you look
at them and you're like there's really
no need for them to custom sleeve cables
because there's just so many other
things wrong with it that custom sleeve
cables wouldn't even make it look much
better yeah but this is one of those
that has potential to set to enter into
the the factor the notion of possibility
of custom custom sleeping your tables
because it looks really nice so I think
adding some custom sleep cables in there
might just give it the edge it needs to
really look like a showpiece I could
make it
oh yeah right when i get right now the
cables are subtle and they kind of blend
in right to say the cables can be a like
more of a feature right um you know if
you go for that but overall again very
nice yep both of the builds we've looked
at so far I've had a hard time finding
too much fault with well done alright so
here's another one this is from wrong oh
he's got three different ones here let's
just look at one of them are j &amp;amp; myers
1962 sometimes Ivan over here so let's
look at this one first ooh okay to be
quiet build so the first thing I noticed
about this is very good cable management
yes very tidy I like how you've removed
the drive cage that you're not using to
open up a bit more air flow coming in
from the front of the case I think that
was a smart move I like how you replaced
your exhaust fan in the back with a beak
another be quiet silent series fan or
silent wings fan i should say but i'm a
little confused as to the the overall
theme and color scheme because you've
got some green LED fans at the top which
could do pretty well i think they're
bitfenix fans i'm not sure but you've
also got a red ROG I'm sorry now ROG
it's an asrock bored so I think it kind
of looks little Christmasy to me yeah
the red and the green don't blend ryan
SI me i would say red leds on those top
fans or no leds are just straight black
fans nice it'd be nice yeah i mean well
the whole thing has like there's only a
little bit of red in there that it's all
for the motherboard and dim and the
memory yeah um so yeah I'd say if it was
all blacked out even like more more the
be quiet fans new Gotham the op or
something like that I think it would
blend a little bit more for me right I
have a very I'm very particular about
LED case fans anyway I i do i'm not a
big fan of them yeah big fans of hands
yeah nah nice place yeah we have a cup i
agree builds i think that were linked
here hold on yep overall a nice looking
build though oh we're gonna go through
all okay wall down smooth tough steak
what else just happen it was weird
what's hard to see but we these are all
from the same guy so let's let's look at
him oh that was clean I like that
okay sex it we got one more here this is
from Carlo let's do like two or three
more Carlo lutea Garlow there we go so
again what you were saying Paul with the
LED fans they can be a bigger they can
be a nice accent when used appropriately
or thing you be kind of distracting um I
don't really see too many LED fans on
the cpu cooler yeah but I kind of like
it I see the potential for it if it's
done correctly but I feel like you might
need some additional LED fans in there
just to complement that one fan because
right when i look at it that's the only
thing I see in the case is I'm looking
straight at that led fan and it's very
distracting but if you had some other
LED fans may be at the top I mean it
looks like you got some room with the
top to mount some fans there may be four
exhaust at the top of the case this
looks like a 760 T case if i'm not
mistaken so it's probably got some
there's definitely got some fan mounts
up there lots of room i think if you had
some additional fans just like that
exactly the same blue LED up there it
would look really cool hmm but also
we're going with the blue and red theme
and I feel like blue and red doesn't
bother me as much as red and green like
the last one yeah where I can deal with
it if that's your thing you know it's
reading reading Green always says
Christmas it does unless there's
something else going on there right now
but all in all again good cable
management we're getting good cable
management for these pictures yeah we
haven't seen anything that looks like
spelling worried or like cable monster
okay if you just clean up those cables
that look great yeah great great cable
management and it was there I think
there is to 5000 one thing that I would
that I would be nitpicky about oh yeah
let's moving on this next one the last
that's the same ok chosen same system
one thing I would be nitpicky about
going back to this one is you have the
second drive cage on top only
accommodating a hard drive now if it
were me I would probably try to find a
way to just get like a five-minute
quarter inch to three and a half inch
adapter for that hard drive put it in
the five and a quarter inch bay up top
if there was room and just remove that
drive cage all together just open up the
air flow a bit that would really bother
me but I don't think there's any dress
below that but exactly yeah
there's no SSD is there anything oh yeah
that would be good good thing I need to
find one more okay yeah the seven apt
though you have a 780 teeth all right
and you love right it's a great case 762
oh you have to summon 62 that's right
780 is the crazy water cooling one um
the cool let's do two more Gary let's do
two more Gary 971 do it do it I'll do it
do it right she said I'm just creating
stiller this is all I got that okay
here's my boobs yeah I like how they're
using the hashtag pin my pc nice you
guys should definitely do that all the
time do that all the time when you send
me pictures from now on for this segment
that way we could we could probably more
easily organize them and arrange them
what gpus are those those might be
tightened or cuz imma days a whole wide
range of GPUs that those might be indeed
Titan 787-8 eTI's nine 80s right I'm
kind of curious so what do you think
well what about the build overall or
build overall um what stands out to you
so I like to build over all this again
looks like a 760 T if i'm not mistaken
actually I'm pretty sure this is a 760
to because of this the amounts on the
back right I like the hardware that I'm
seeing in here yeah you're gonna msi
what I'm guessing I believe that's a z97
motherboard or maybe as the 87 I like
the SLI configuration um I would say
with those cable extensions that are all
whites those could be bunched up a
little bit better I feel like they
they're they're a little bit kind of
little loose in there so maybe maybe
some type of some white zip ties or even
black zip ties and a couple positions
along each of those extension some white
zip ties I think would look really nice
I could clean that up a little bit the
thermaltake power supply I'm sure as
great as a power supply the the logos
and images on it look horrible
it looks like a 90 it's like orange good
you got the thermaltake orange and you
got a blue streak going in there for
some reason and there's also some neon
green for no apparent reason right um I
would want to cover that up somehow if
this is going to be more of a showpiece
especially this is 760 T right it has a
big old side panel window that would
stand out to me maybe get like a cool
custom decal for it that fits right over
that yeah something like that or her a
power supply cover yeah I think those
like those two things that they clean up
those cables a little bit and did
something about that power supply would
make everything tying a lot more other
than that you've got mostly black with
some white some yellow on the MSI
motherboard and some green on the on the
logos for the for the cards would have
been a video cards yeah so the green and
the yellow is like okay like it's not
it's not the best matching wise but
right they would pass but yeah you got
to get rid of some of some of the stuff
in the power supply think if you want
everything that to kind of tie in yeah
exactly agree yep but nice build-up to
agreed good yeah no management again I'm
so happy all these builds that such good
cable management I know you see it's so
many like builds that are just like like
just put it all yeah we had some
disasters on with you every one pin my
setup with Matt oh yeah Jesus the buzzer
those are always fun to talk about they
are getting so big alright and let's
let's do our last one before we wrap up
this segment here and move on in the
next one all right let's go for Mitch
Mitch and Ben hunter sent us a gate what
what oh come on what oh okay we have to
show this one wait did he seriously show
both of these so he used an xbox 360 in
closure for a pc been hunter senses this
picture over which is an xbox 360 xbox
360 yeah I haven't drank as much this
week as I drink last week you just are
getting stupider he said max temps GPU
70 CPU 50 at San I 533 30 and a gtx 660
in there I'm impressed Wow good job very
good job the ultimate console killer now
granted I can
well he's got the power supply apparel
yeah so you have to kind of work to like
where you set that and where everything
else is gonna be set up but I like that
I like so wait wait so those are going
where those cable just something this is
this is a pet this is the IO for the
motherboard will ya this is the graphics
card he must have put on a probably a
PCI Express extension cable so he could
angle it vertically room that's a mini
ITX motherboard and then he got
extensions or something else for all of
the internal power connectors so that he
could feed them at the back and connect
them to the power supply as far as I can
tell oh oh icic his power supply power
supplies is a box sitting on the
Maccabiah wow interesting yeah and I
hope you don't run this on the carpet
all the time by the way oh yeah put that
up somewhere where people can see it
that's really interesting though alright
well imma get this last one from mich md
this is his rig he's showing us right
here's a medical doctor mitcham do ya
look at that it's not cooler right there
so we got a that's an AMD scores it is
taken for sure do that is get some blue
dims possibly and this is my say this is
probably the first of of the segment
where could use some a little bit of
cable management help Kayla measurement
could use some love there yeah I mean
you've got what what case is this this
is a I don't know what okay there's the
hex I don't recognize or just heard this
drive cage thing going on but it looks
like you've got some space behind the
motherboard tray at least at least some
routing holes if not a routing hold that
you at least got like a like a little
slick area you can tuck them behind
utilize that because you're paying for
that feature not all cases have that and
it looks like you could stash some of
that cable input your supplemental cpu
power which is going right across the
front right which is functional but a
little bit garish when it comes to Kayla
management's discussion so yeah right
any anything you can do to route that
behind the mother work again we don't
know what case this is so if this
happens to be one of those cases that
just has no room behind the motherboard
tray which I really can't tell from and
does it because you look like as video
cards plug into a lower slot I mean
maybe not everyone yes I mean as long as
it's you know the
just capable slot then you're good but
you might want to go I've done yeah it
looks like there is actually what I
think is a USB right maybe a USB 3.0
that's what it looks at it here because
it looks like there's a plug going to
the front of the case yeah so maybe had
one of those internal pass through USB
3.0 lets you plugged in internally i
would say um swamp-like functionally if
you have the same amount of lanes
available on both blogs yeah it
shouldn't really be a thing some people
will say well there's distance there and
that adds some degree of latency even
though it's the speed of light yeah
times like four inches or whatever right
so yes ultimately when it comes down to
it the top slot is going to be the most
ideal sure and it might help out your
cable management a little bit especially
since you've got a cable going across
that expansion card need to drop that
down to one of the lowest slots you
maybe hide it a little bit more because
it looks like that I'll yeah he's
getting closer to your power supply just
kind of back and bring that bring that
GPU up a little bit higher getting the
GP up a little bit higher to a lot a
little bit more airflow through there
you can get it away from that power
supply will also be potentially an
improvement as well right and and
definitely get some blue dims I mean
consider getting some some blue sticks
of memory and saving those ones as
backup because you always anyone can
they always benefit from backup ram
trust me uh and ever it'll just look a
lot nicer overall or if you don't want
to spend more money on upgrades or
anything right now yeah like well mouth
good pull them out mask off mask off
obviously be a hot tax yeah mascot the
PCB and you can spray paint them I mean
right it's not something you wanna do
yeah that'd be cool too but definitely
has potential yeah nice build oh thanks
guys thanks everyone who submitted
builds yeah absolutely and also guys let
me know what you think of this segment I
want to know if I should be doing this
more consistently or if I should access
all together it's terrible and screw you
for copying that um but let me know let
us know in the chat if you like this
type of thing I think it's I think it's
fun because its interactive with the
audience with you guys and impala
naughty to check out your rigs and just
see what you guys with you guys have
right because not in your segment jelly
does a straight jelly bra alright cool
well thank you guys for participating I
really appreciate all of you guys
sending in those pictures it really
helped out the segment a lot because
obviously wouldn't exist without all of
your participation so on that note on a
closing finale we are going to do some
Q&amp;amp;A where we take your questions and we
try to answer them to the best of our
abilities oh good so go ahead and tweet
at us Paul's hardware at all hardware on
Twitter or at forever Kyle or you can
just blow up our chat at twitch right
here and we'll try to answer whatever
you guys might have those bills little
balls um word Jetboy 71 said he's gonna
hand me some peanut butter to go with my
jelly oh hell no I'm a jelly ah I'm
jelly your segment oh no he didn't ah
okay I thought that was pretty fantastic
um wow is that question I recently all
right what's what's dead Angley felon I
don't know if this is I recently
overclocked my 4690 k which is cooled by
corsair h60 with a 120 millimeter a year
able to Diana style in a stable
overclock of 4.4 megahertz at one point
19 volts ran Intel burn test few times
and ran prime95 for four hours with no
problems also been with cinebench
my idle temps were 25 to 30 c load temps
were 75 to 80 i don't dare push higher
overclock due to my cooling restrictions
i was wondering if there's anything else
you'd recommend to help test stability
any thoughts would help get a better
cooling solution or under clock I mean a
coarser age 60 75 80 see max you could
even go hotter than that you can go yeah
I don't see it up to 90 ish even if you
wanted to push it further but 4.4 at 1.9
is very nice yeah keeping that voltage
down for me is it great yeah great to be
able to do you will lengthen life of
your CPU over the higher voltage /
clocks that are out there so if you're
looking for a daily overclock that you
just leave there and don't change 4.4
1.19 volts i'd say stick with that you
seem like you're sitting pretty good
prime95 an Intel burn test
are both synthetic tests that put way
more of a load on your cpu than you'll
ever experience with anything that you
do normally right so I think you're
practically sitting pretty pretty well
right there yep say if you are concerned
with any kind of cooling issues or
cooling capacity I would also suggest
going to the into your you a fi and
seeing if it supports adaptive voltage
and switching it over to that once
you've dialed in your overclock because
instead of running at the same voltage
at all times to your overclock settings
it'll actually dial down whenever you're
at a low-power state and you're just
idling that way you're not burning on
unnecessary calories for your computer
so to speak one hour so that's also a
good thing to do check out adaptive
voltage settings there's another
question from zero mind who asks with
nvme consumer drives emerging like the
Intel 750 series mmm which I did video
AMA JJ this this past week do you think
there's any reason to invest in a non
nvm em2 pcie drive at the moment or
should I wait until nvme stuff becomes
more prevalent um it's hard to say
depending on your needs and what you do
with your computer and like how
frequently you use it because for me if
you need something now and you're going
to use it now than buy it now like with
PCs you can always always always say
well in a month or in two months or
three months or in six months there's
going to be something better that's just
something you have to accept you you
know people build pcs learn that really
early on like I just did to a 980 SLI
configuration and I was ready for NVIDIA
to launch the Titan Dex I was like you
know and videos coming out we're going
to come out with something it's gonna be
better and my you know fastest GPU
updated in aren't gonna be fastest
anymore it's just kind of something you
have to come around to territory that
said nvme is pretty awesome but even
what you can get right now with m2 and
pcie still using HCI is still very
impressive yeah the amount of
performance you get with nvme like when
we're talking about like the 750 which
if you get to 1.2 terabyte version can
go upwards of twenty to twenty four
twenty seven hundred megabytes per
second reads on the drive in about 1.2
to 1.4
bytes per second rights it's hard to
make use of that much speed for one and
the PCIe drives that are still HD ahci
can still do a good amount i mean you
can still find pcie drives that are HD i
mean granted they're the newer ones but
that can do over 1 1.2 gigabytes per
second reads and writes yum so yeah if
if you find something that's
cost-effective it works for you than yes
go ahead and dive in if you're waiting
for nvme then wait for nvme I think
we're expecting between cute or the end
of q2 this year around June and through
to the end of the year we're expecting
to see a lot more nvme stuff come out
we're going to see some new platforms
launch or hopefully a new platform
launched on the Intel side which might
have some new updates in that area and
then what we're also going to see is the
manufacturers of motherboards actually
updating their current boards as well as
older boards depending on the
manufacturer and how how how invested
they are yeah I'm going back and
updating so that in your motherboard
selection menu you can choose not only
ide and HCI and raid mode but also nvme
mode right them which which is what you
need in order to use those drives nice a
pop a squat asked which is better 4790 k
or 5820 k only a fifty dollar difference
on newegg going to be doing some gaming
and video / photo editing and uh 5820 k
is just better in general if you're just
talking like yes or no answer hmm and
for video photo editing I would say go
to the K 20 K if you're doing it
professionally and you're doing it for
not just leisure but it's like for you
know a side job that you have going on
you really want the most out of here if
you're doing it a lot but you're in a
lot but you also have to keep in mind
that when you're jumping up to 58 20 k
you're not just looking at the
difference in the price between the 47
90 k and the 5820 k which might be only
about 50 bucks you do for you're also
looking at you're going to need ddr4
memory instead of ddr3 you're going to
be the next 99 motherboard instead of a
Z 97 and xam motherboards and ddr4
memory are all more expensive so it's
not just that price difference between
cpus so unless you're doing a lot of
video editing or a lot of photo editing
i would say stick with the z 97 and a 47
90 k simply because you could probably
overclock that a little bit faster man
it's hard to hard to say exactly chips
vary from chip two chip but you can get
a good overclock out of a 47 90 k you're
not going to spend as much on the
chipset the memory is going to be a lot
cheaper granted it's not as much as it
was like five six months ago but ddr4 is
still more expensive and you're going to
be able to maybe even get more ddr3
memory than you would be able to get
with ddr4 so it's hard to say exactly um
but if your focus is more on the gaming
side and say stick with 47 90 k if
you're you don't need x 90 90 if you're
by no ramen you need X I there's
absolutely no reason only if you have a
workstation application and you're doing
heavy like multi drug applications you
need an i7 then go X I nine if you're
gaming don't even bother it's just a
waste of money it really is buggy if
you're gonna do a lot of rendering if
you're gonna do a lot of video editing
if you're gonna do anything else that is
CPU intensive than 58 20k is a great
great CPU and I and I like that intel on
this time around made the 50 20k
overclockable yeah yeah its links in tow
oh that sucks oh no that's x oh no how
did that happen it happened live though
how did that beer just magically get
there it's been there the whole place
swishing it on to me I wasn't this is
just the closest possible place for it
to go not on my keyboard is this a good
time to end the show Kyle this is a
perfect time down the show Paul because
I need to clean this off the morning you
shouldn't drink beer around your
electronics parts guys be smart don't be
safe put the beer because you might
spill a beer right across your keyboard
got your laptop damn it Paul not the Cal
just did that I totally didn't not at
all I'll clean off well anyway
thanks for watching this video guys a
log video coming soon on the endurance
of the g550 eight how to remove g55
fatigue AC want a leakage problem you
gotta make lemons
eliminate your limited I know how the
lemons video coming soon guys guys thank
you so much for watching the stream so I
ready for telling me to slap you I
really have to I'm not gonna slap you
know I don't do about you I'll be adding

that Jesus I'm sorry alright guys thank
you good thank you so much for watching
see you next week mobile hit the like
button console Kyle effing like button
all right Jesus leave me alone thanks
for sticking with us we are gonna be
playing some games later are we still
playing games later oh no we try to play
some games later many more might play
some GTA 4 so you can check out Kyle's
