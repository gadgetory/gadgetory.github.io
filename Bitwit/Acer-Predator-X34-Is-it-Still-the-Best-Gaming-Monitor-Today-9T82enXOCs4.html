Taiwan Excellence Awards that's right
Paul established in 1992 in well Taiwan
the TE A's were created to recognize
innovation and value among Taiwanese
products like the Acer predator x34 that
I'm reviewing today exceptional items
are selected for the robust R&amp;amp;D design
quality and international marketing
these awards epitomize the state's
ability to use innovation to create
added value in the design and
manufacturing of cutting-edge products
you can find more info about the Taiwan
excellence awards and their products in
the descriptions below what's up
gasp so about one year ago Acer released
a premium monitor that was critically
acclaimed by numerous reviewers to be
the best gaming panel to ever hit the
market unfortunately I wasn't able to
snag one for review at the time and
after many dead ends I eventually gave
up all hope of ever seeing one arrived
on my doorstep until it did twelve
months after its initial release in the
United States I am finally giving you my
review on the Acer predator X 34 now in
case this thing has somehow flown under
your radar for the last year and you've
got your credit card at the ready at
this very moment I'm gonna crush your
dreams at the start of this video by
saying this monitor retails for about
$1,300
trust me it's better you find out sooner
granted the ludicrous price tag may not
bother any of you high rollers out there
so at this point the only thing that
matters is what makes this monitor a cut
above the rest
well firing off the main specs first
we're dealing with a curved 34 inch 21
by 9 ultra wide IPS display with a
resolution of 34 40 by 1440 the panel
sports an advertised greater gray
response time of 4 milliseconds not bad
for IPS and a default refresh rate of 60
Hertz that's overclockable to 100 Hertz
top that off with built-in g-sync
support and it's not hard to see why I
am a quick tour before we get into the
fun stuff the screens matte finish keeps
glare and reflections to a minimum for
the most part and I think the subtle
curvature strikes a nice balance between
offering and immersive gaming experience
and a reasonable landscape for browsing
and productivity sleek black bezels on
the top and sides measure a centimeter
in thickness making their way to a
stylized chin bar with super cool
branding and under glow LEDs to let your
friends know that you paid a lot for
this thing within the on-screen display
users can
between LED colors including red blue
green orange white and my personal
favorite off as well as a few preset
lighting effects in my opinion the OSD
itself could be much improved here with
the buttons underneath the right side of
the panel it's kind of difficult to know
which one you're pressing which makes it
all the more frustrating that the menu
navigation is not intuitive at all even
after getting used to the button layout
it still takes way too many clicks to
adjust any given setting it took me 15
clicks just to overclock the monitors
refresh rate that's right you actually
use the on-screen display to overclock
the refresh rate of the panel I do like
the option for throwing up a refresh
rate counter though along with other
settings like pixel overdrive DTS tuning
for the built-in speakers and
user-defined profiles that you can
switch between on-the-fly the back side
of the predator looks all aggressive and
stiff and I've left my fingerprints on
the glossy finish to convey my thoughts
on glossy finishes supported stand
adjustments include lift and 40 degree
tilt five down and 35 up I would have
liked to see some swivel action here for
sharing the screen with someone in the
room but there is a 100 by 100 vase of
wall mount for those with more specific
needs the stand also features a carrying
handle for easy transport and a cable
routing hole that I wish had a small
break somewhere to pass cables in and
out more easily if you have a small desk
like myself another thing to consider
here is that the stand while gorgeous
has a massive footprint and since its
kind of designed like a tripod with
three legs it's not like you can just
let the base overhang the edge of the
desk if you wanted to position the
monitor further away from you so make
sure that your desk space isn't just
wide enough but has the proper depth as
well for the rear i/o you'll find a DC
input 3.5 millimeter audio out a USB 3
upstream port and for USB 3 inputs video
outs include HDMI 1.4 which is
overclockable to 60 Hertz but you'll
have to connect to the DisplayPort 1.2
ports with a supported Nvidia card if
you want a taste of that g-sync
lifestyle now I've tested out this
technology several times on the
convention show floor but being able to
set up a g-sync panel in my own room for
the first time without any crowds or
blaring music from the booth next door
look at @ug skill was so much better
err meh gerd having your monitors
refresh rate dynamically adjust to metro
GPUs frame rates is a simple concept to
understand but
has to be experienced to appreciate the
full effect by completely eliminating
the issue of screen tearing that comes
with traditional vsync disabled and
stuttering that occurs with vsync on
visibly there's nothing left to disrupt
the rendered frame output and pairing
that with the 100 Hertz refresh rate for
the first time feels like someone dumped
a vat of hot Lube on your whole gaming
experience
seriously it's like Lube on everything
gameplay is so smooth it's almost silk
like and while this goes for any kind of
genre really fast-paced games like first
person shooters tend to pay the biggest
dividends with an enormous reduction in
motion blur then there's that sexy curve
an ultra wide aspect ratio which
envelops your head and peripheral vision
to suck you even deeper into the game
much more effectively I might add than a
triple display setup this is of course
assuming the game you're playing
supports 21 by 9 otherwise you get these
thick black bars on the sides that are
kind of annoying but I'll gladly live
with it all things considered in terms
of pixel counts the resolution we're
dealing with here is much closer to 2560
by 1440 than it is to 4k but to run it
high refresh rates you'll still want a
high end GPU akin to something like the
gtx 1070 or better as an extension of
gaming twitch streaming with this panel
was actually fantastic with plenty of
real estate for things like chat and
xsplit while still allowing me to game
at 2560 by 1440 ultra wide at this
resolution also works like a dream for
general desktop browsing and workstation
applications like video editing though I
can't see how the screens curvature
might distort the perspective of those
looking for pinpoint accuracy with their
compositions content creators who deal
with color correction on the other hand
will appreciate the IPS displays 100%
srgb color gamut and 10-bit color depth
aided by dinner rate luckily us gamers
benefit from these specs as well now
when streaming the usual fanfare of
online video Netflix doesn't appear to
support 21 by 9 as of yet so you're
stuck in sidebar city unless you use a
browser extension to fill the screen but
that adds a significant vertical crop to
your image however nothing's worse than
getting the sidebars and the cinematic
strips on the top and bottom I've seen
arcade cabinets with better-looking
bezels at the very least there is some
21 by 9 content on the youtubes that
looks pretty damn good but it seems
we're still far from making this a
mainstream aspect ratio on content
platforms as for backlight bleed there
are some affected areas in the corners
of
screen but it's minimal enough to go
unnoticed in the majority of scenarios
summing things up here there's a lot to
love about this monitor black bars OSD
and the price are not any of them but if
you're really into PC gaming with a
high-end system to boot haha this is by
far the best gaming monitor I have ever
come across even now a solid year after
its initial release but that's gonna do
it for now guys so let me know what you
