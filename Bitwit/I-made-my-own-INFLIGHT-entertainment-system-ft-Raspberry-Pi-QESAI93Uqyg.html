Virginia visiting my sister-in-law and
brother-in-law for that matter its
whitey sauces sister who just had a baby
so I'm now an uncle we're visiting
family and stuff so I'm actually
shooting in their house right now which
is why I'm in a bedroom that's that's
unfamiliar to me I'm I chose this room
because the echo is actually not too bad
and the Lighting's decent so this is
what we're working with today I'm gonna
show you guys exactly how I made my own
in-flight entertainment center set up
whatever you want to call it gee
willikers what's that thing in your hand
it looks sad and probably doesn't
perform well you'll be much happier with
the iron claw RGB gaming mouse from
Corsair it has a lightweight body and
contoured shape that's perfect for palm
grips and larger hands an 18,000 dpi
optical sensor built to last Omron
switches and seven programmable buttons
are sure to make this your new favorite
pointer click on the link below for more
info I've been pretty fed up with the
in-flight entertainment screens that
most planes have either the video
quality sucks or the audio I think the
audio is probably the biggest issue it's
usually just terrible quality and not
loud enough to even overcome the sounds
of the plane the touchscreens are
usually really finicky and you never
really know what you're gonna get with
the actual media selection sometimes
it's fairly limited so I decided to make
my own portable entertainment center and
I actually got to test mine out on the
plane right here so I'm gonna show you
guys exactly how I went about putting it
together and how it actually worked out
for me on the plane in action it's also
worth noting that this was a total
unexpected and impromptu idea that I had
the night before my flight left the next
morning so I had limited time and very
limited materials to put this all
together so consider this a prototype of
sorts a rushed prototype so don't judge
me too hard let's take a look at the
parts to make this happen for starters
we have this portable monitor from you
perfect it's a Chinese brand thirteen
point three inches which is quite a bit
larger than the screens you'll find on
most planes and I did it to the kid
video on this so if you want to find out
more information about it go ahead and
check that out but it's IPs you can see
that we've got quite a bit of i/o here
full-sized HDMI mini DisplayPort USB
type-c ones just for power and data the
others actually Thunderbolt three
supported and you can see here I've
actually mounted a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ on
the backside of the display it would
have been a lot easier if I had an
actual case for the Raspberry Pi but
again this was the night before and I
did not have one so instead I took in
the lid of an Altoid box drilled some
holes in it and
tied the Raspberry Pi to the box that
way I could actually have a flat surface
that would adhere well to the display
using some adhesive velcro pretty simple
you can also see I bent down some of the
tin right here so we have access to the
micro SD card on that's got our
operating system on it I also kind of
tried to roll the edges there so I don't
cut myself from the process of handling
it this is what's driving the whole
scene it's running the whole show and
it's perfectly capable of playing back
HD video you can see we've got an HDMI a
little HDMI cable coming off of here and
I've got a little tie down there for
cable management to keep it from
flopping around this goes straight into
the monitor just like that and then on
the other side we have USB there's four
USB ports here you can see we've already
populated three of them two more dongles
one for a mouse one for keyboard and
then this is actually a 32 gig USB stick
that we have our movies floated on to
now originally I tried to use the last
USB port to power the monitor which is
why I have this little cable management
accessory thing that's just stuck on
with adhesive but I ended up not needing
to use this because the USB port on the
Raspberry Pi wasn't enough to actually
drive this display so instead we're just
gonna power it straight from this five
volt 2.4 amp USB AC adapter that's
assuming of course that my seat on the
plane will actually have an outlet that
works and is able to use this in case it
doesn't however we have a 20,000
milliamp battery
this thing's a total beast this is from
easy acts or easy ACC I'm not exactly
sure how they pronounce it but it's
fantastic little unit I've been using
this for a while now it's got four USB
ports five volts 2 amp connections and
it's even got a little flashlight on
there which might actually come in handy
on the plane and essentially we have two
cables powering the entire setup one end
is USB type A and the other ends are USB
type-c to drive the monitor and micro
USB in order to power the Raspberry Pi
you can see I zip-tied both three foot
cables together just for ease of use and
to keep them a bit more tidy on the
plane now I could have just plopped this
monitor down on the fold-out tray in
front of me but then I would have had to
look down the whole time while watching
movies and that eventually leads to a
lot of neck pain and it's just it's
really bad posture it's not very
comfortable so I want to get this eye
level or as eye level as possible which
is why I bought this little car mount
it's actually a suction mount you can
see that there's a magnet on this side
this is from OHL pro by the way but the
mount came with a couple magnetic pieces
that have adhesive on one side so I just
stuck one to the monitor and it's as
simple as clicking it like that
and then you just stick the suction cup
onto the actual entertainment screen of
the plane that's assuming of course that
your plane has an entertainment screen
otherwise this kind of doesn't work but
every cross-country flight I've ever
taken has had an in-flight display so I
wasn't too worried about that but moving
on here we have a couple peripherals to
control everything this is not a
touchscreen so we needed some devices to
interface with the OS so we've got this
little candy board that I didn't buy
specifically for this project I've had
this for like years for years and years
and it's just a handy little USB mini
keyboard obviously you have to use your
thumbs to type it's not a full-fledged
keyboard and it's got this nice little
trackpad that you can use horizontally
or vertically most of the time however
I'll probably be using this Logitech G
305 wireless mouse which is a fantastic
gaming mouse for being Wireless it's
it's super quick and responsive enough
that we really need it to be it's not
like we're gaming on this thing or
anything but this mouse is also pretty
portable so it's perfect for travel very
sharp sensor Omron switches and then
finally we've got our headset now I
actually initially wanted to bring my
QuietComfort twos from Bose the the
noise cancelling ones because those are
perfect for airplane rides they just
cancel out all the plane noise but
bluetooth was not working bluetooth
wasn't working properly I should say on
the Raspberry Pi because it does have
built-in Wi-Fi 802 data 11 AC as well as
bluetooth but the Bluetooth was just not
being very stable with that Bose headset
so it just kept connecting and
disconnecting so eventually I just got
sick of trying since again limited time
and went with this guy because it has
its own wireless dongle that bypasses
all that bluetooth nonsense it's kind of
funky because you've got this microphone
and stuff it's a little awkward bringing
this on a plane but whatever gets the
job done so those are all the pieces of
our little makeshift entertainment
center it looks like there's quite a lot
here but it actually fits inside of a
small backpack it doesn't take up much
more room than an ordinary laptop would
and of course this could have all been
made much simpler if I just stuck with
this suction mount and maybe gotten the
tablet that has you know sort of
all-inclusive battery source and touch
screen and stuff like that but this is
way funner
this is this is way funnier was
definitely a bit more interesting and
warranted in actual video Plus this was
the first time that I actually had sort
of a neat idea on how to use the
Raspberry Pi that I got for Christmas
last year and this is the very first
application that I've ever used it for
so I'm kind of excited just to see how
it all works out in fact as I mentioned
I'm already in Virginia's
I have already tested this whole setup
ow so let's talk about what worked and
what didn't when I finally got in the
air by the way if you in case you're
wondering I got this through TSA
security wine no problem I took this out
of the bag and so it was this was all
exposed like people around me were like
kind of staring at it like what the heck
is that things but TSA just kind of
briefly glanced at it and moved me along
no questions asked like they don't even
pull my bag or anything on it could have
also been because it was super crowded
at LAX that day but yeah that was my
experience anyway I didn't have any
issues getting this past security so
let's talk about how this all performed
the suction mount was flawless I mean
there was no issues whatsoever holding
up or supporting the weight of the
monitor and the Raspberry Pi didn't fall
down once it felt completely solid and
even during some mild turbulence on our
flight there was just a very minimal
wiggle and I was still able to continue
watching my movie without any problems
really there is one caveat here and
that's the fact that the mount sticks
out just a little bit too far you can
see there's several inches of a gap
between there and it actually put the
monitor a little too close to my eyes I
actually had to recline my seat in order
to watch the movies more comfortably but
once that happened it was fine also it's
just a little bit more obvious when it's
sticking out you know several inches
from from the chair in front of you to
other other people on the plane and the
stewardess so in the future I'd like to
actually find a mount that has a shorter
arm or at least a thinner mounting
mechanism that brings the screen much
closer to the seat in front of me also
while this part of the mount tilts up
and down which is which is nice to have
it doesn't really pan all that much it's
very limited in that area so if I wanted
to do some screen sharing for example
cos wifey sauce was sitting next to me
during the flight it'd be nice to get a
mount that has some decent panning range
as well the only problem with that is
that you know whoever sitting next to
you would have to turn their head in
order to see the screen so potentially
in the future maybe I'll look for a
mounting solution that actually puts the
monitor evenly between two seats on a
plane now fortunately my seat did have
an AC power outlet which is great
unfortunately it was a very loose outlet
so even the slightest tug on our cables
here would actually pull the AC adapter
completely out of the socket which of
course would kill the power to both our
monitor and our Raspberry Pi which is no
good which is why our easy ACC battery
pack saved the day here it worked
beautifully driving both devices and
even though it's a little bit large it's
very easy to stow it in the pouch in
front of you the battery life held up
incredibly well also after about 2 hours
of continuous video playback I think we
only got down to about 75% as in decay
by the little charging LEDs so
altogether it's looking like you could
probably get around eight hours of heavy
usage out of this battery which is
perfect even for lengthier flights the
cables actually worked out pretty well
but they could have been a little bit
longer I think four feet would have been
perfect especially when plugging into
the AC outlet that was closer to the
floor I think it'd also be kind of cool
to get some cable management accessories
to actually route these cables neatly
around the seat in front of you so that
they're not in the way so you can move
your tray up and down a bit more easily
the Raspberry Pi held up beautifully it
ran all of our movies without a hitch I
was really happy with the performance
there as well as the the performance of
our monitor I'm not going to go into too
much detail if you guys want to watch
the dedicated video on this guy you know
where to find it overall this part of
the setup worked beautifully and this is
kind of the bread and butter of the
whole thing so I was really happy about
that of course I think there's some room
for improvement
I need a case for the Raspberry Pi it'll
just give me some peace of mind and also
I might actually rotate this so that the
USB ports are sticking out of the side
not sticking out but just flush with the
side of the monitor to make them more
accessible in case I need to use them on
the flight the mouse and candy board
were fantastic they each kind of do
things that the other one can't this one
obviously has the keyboard and this
one's just easier to work with if you
have the trade down but if the trays up
in front of you then you kind of resort
to the trackpad which also works just
fine I was using VLC player that came
pre-installed on our operating system
which by the way was the raspbian I'm
still I'm a total Raspberry Pi noob so I
think it's raspbian OS that had VLC and
that's oh we were playing all the movies
so there were actually a lot of media
control functions through that app that
were already programmed to both our
mouse and candy board which made the
experience a bit more seamless and then
finally we had our Corsair Void Pro
headset there were no drops our cutouts
during the whole flight no interference
despite being in a giant metal box in
the sky this thing worked flawlessly and
while the audio or while the ear cups
are definitely not noise isolating you
can definitely hear the sounds of the
plane the volume gets plenty loud to
make that a non-issue so I was really
happy about that the only thing here is
that we've got this microphone that
makes you look like a total dork on a
plane but I think the rest of the setup
in front of me was already doing a
pretty good job of that so this was just
icing on the cake so that's pretty much
it that's how I put it together and how
it all worked for me in the end I'm
really impressed with how it worked out
considering the fact that it was a very
last-minute idea and there's obviously
like I mentioned a lot of areas that
need improvement but at least it shows
pretty good potential for a DIY port of
entertainment set up so if you guys like
this video hustle like on it before you
go also let me know what you think about
this setup is it ridiculous I mean yes
obviously it's ridiculous but would you
ever consider doing something like this
I'm actually kind of curious I love this
kind of craft so curious to see if you
guys feel the same way but thank you
guys so much for watching this video I'm
gonna get out of here spend some time
with family and I'll see you guys very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
