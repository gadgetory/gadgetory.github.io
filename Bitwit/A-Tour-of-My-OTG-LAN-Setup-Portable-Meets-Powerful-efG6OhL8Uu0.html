channel today I'm showing off my new
land party setup I guess you would call
it then I'm gonna be bringing with me
two tech syndicates land syndicate which
is happening this weekend we're actually
hopping on a plane me my wife and Steve
Steve underscore oMG on Twitter we're
all hopping on a plane today we're gonna
go meet Paul and other rest of the crew
in Seattle for a long-ass weekend of
gaming drinking food and all out just
crazy mayhem fun so super excited about
that again thanks to Logan and friends
for having me
and stuff like that so I just wanted to
quickly go over give you guys a brief
tour of all the crap that I'm bringing
to in particular everything that's on
this 2 by 2 mod mat Square here this is
like my land central headquarters that
I'm going to be setting up exactly in
this way when I'm at the event so yeah
there's a lot of good stuff here a lot
of it you guys are probably probably
already familiar with it a lot of this
hardware has already been featured on
the channel at some point some of it has
not so first off as I mentioned this is
all resting on a mod math so MOG matt is
typically just a match that you roll out
that is meant for building PCs on
essentially it's a really handy tool but
the reason why I'm actually bringing
with me to text in the kit or Lansing
the kid I should say is because it has a
really nice grip on it and I don't know
exactly what kind of tables or benches
or whatever they're gonna have at the
event but I'll explain later why I need
us and some good grip for this setup
additionally I've got this text in the
kit mouse pad which of course what what
better mouse pad is there to bring to an
event like this it's nice and it's big
enough but it's not too big it's not one
of those excel pads of course that would
be a little bit gratuitous especially
since I already have everything resting
on the mod mat but it's really nice I
love the stitch edges I hate mouse pads
that don't have stitch edges now because
it just rubs against and irritates my
wrists when I'm gaming especially on my
right when I'm now singing stuff
speaking of which I do have this mouse
key a Logitech g600 this is my trusty
wireless companion on the go
I know Wireless is you get a lot of
you're gonna crucify me for having a
wireless mouse while gaming however I am
bringing a backup mouse this is my G 500
also from Logitech that this is my daily
driver that I use for everything gaming
editing 24/7 so I'm bringing this as a
backup and also it's kind of like Dena
some people like my wife for example she
can't go anywhere on a trip without
bringing her pillow like she needs her
pillow no matter where she's going
wherever she's gonna sleep at night
because it makes her feel more you know
comfy it's like it's our comfort pillow
I guess and that's kind of like how this
massive g500 just and no matter where I
am as long as I put my hand on this
thing I feel like I'm home so that's
kind of a cool thing there we've also
got a what do we got this this is a
vermelho vermelho baat 7m I believe
that's right I did a review on this fact
in the day this is a master op sponsored
product not for this video but master up
you can find this board on mass drop
they often have deals on it and things
like that but it is really nice it does
feature Cherry MX brown switches and
it's also got these custom white key
caps that i31 shortly after I did the
review but I really like it because it's
super slim and its high quality it's got
a nice heft to it I don't really need
the mod mats grip for this thing in
particular because it already has decent
grip and it's also got a super slim
bezel which makes it great for an event
like this
additionally working our way back here
we've got my cell phone I'm gonna bring
my cell phone I know that's that's news
right and then but on the cell phone or
underneath that I should say is this
Wireless Kotex it's just some random
brand Chinese brand probably but it's a
wireless charger just so I can just have
my phone just sitting there any time I'm
not using it that way you can just
charge without me having to plug things
in constantly it's really convenient to
have this feature I don't really use the
wireless charging much when I go to
sleep at night I just plug it in
directly to a fast charger and that's
usually good enough for me but in event
like this I think it's actually a really
nice feature to have and then we've got
this monitor here probably a lot of you
are wondering what is this you know
what's the deal one of the specs this is
a g chic 2501 H I think that's correct
and I found this on Amazon I was looking
just tirelessly for a good portable
monitor that was like literally like
portable e you could fold it up into the
size of a laptop weighs less than 2
pounds but it's 1920 by 1080 and the
reason why I like it there's a lot of
portable monitors that are at that
resolution but what sets this one apart
is that it's IPS first of all so I
really need that good color reproduction
when I'm doing video editing or you know
design or whatever it is additionally
it's also got HDMI inputs so it's micro
HDMI mind you but a lot of other
portable monitors will be powered
strictly through and use their data
transfer via USB USB 3 usually and that
wasn't gonna cut for me I mean I've got
an R 9 nano here I want a native HDMI
screen to plug into so I'm really happy
about that
I have tested gaming on this playing GTA
5 and some other games and it looks
really good I mean it looks about it's
exactly right on par with my my msi g60
ghost pro which is a phenomenal laptop
with a great IPS screen they're pretty
much item side-by-side couldn't really
tell the difference so that's a really
good sign additionally we've got a
gaming headset this is an old-school
gaming headset guys this is an HSA
knowing agent HS 1a from Corsair and
it's the first pet set I ever purchased
when I built my first computer so 2011
this thing's five years old however it's
still in relatively good shape except
for the underneath the the headband
there where it is starting to wear down
some of the faux leather but these are
super comfy and I can wear them for our
still there's still one of my most you
know comfortable headsets in in the last
few years Mike is kind of potato quality
but I'm hoping that doesn't affect
things too much also got a webcam up
here just in case we do some live
streaming I'm not sure how much
bandwidth we'll have at the event but
just in the event just in the event at
the event I need a freaking thesauruses
what not what I need so basically this
is a c920 from logitech it's a fantastic
webcam for the price it's 1920 by 1080
and just in the event that we get to do
any live streaming at LAN syndicate I
will probably you know try to hop on for
a little bit at least and then we've
also got a battery pack just standard
ten thousand four hundred milliamps this
is just om but MSI slap it on slept on
their logo because it was a giveaway
technically swag at CES I believe I also
got this C entrance deck port slim I did
a brief review on this as well when I
reviewed the AKG k7 xx's from master off
the deck port slim is really nice it is
exactly what it sounds like it's a
portable
DAC and
an amp it's it's actually really nice
for something like this because we're
gonna be in a warehouse with 200 200
people and things can get pretty noisy
quickly so I want to be able to hear my
gameeee audio as well as any kind of
voice that's coming in and sometimes
you're not going to be like just a
regular pair of headphones like this or
a headset isn't gonna cut it so having
that extra gain with a deck like this is
going to be really useful and hopefully
come in handy when I need it and then I
think last but not least we've got the
freaking gaming rig here this is the go
anywhere do anything PC I just did a
recent video I think the last video I
posted was on water cooling this bad boy
so go ahead and check that out it's
really cool if you haven't already
but again core i7 6700 K overclocked to
4,400 megahertz
courtesy of that liquid cooling that I
was just talking about and also the r9
nano which is a beast of a card and
actually the perfect video card for a
system exactly like this so really happy
how that turned out and you can see here
I've kind of got it actually standing on
the lid of this screen so I'm using the
G sheet monitor screen that's on the
bottom and I've got the computer that's
mounted right on top not mounted but
just standing on top of it however this
is where the mod mat comes in because
the lid to this monitor is probably the
only thing I don't like because it's
super plastic II and there's no rubber
feet on it so when you flip it out it
just has a tendency to slide around and
especially if I'm putting a desktop
computer on top of it I don't want
someone to actually accidentally trip on
a wire and bring the whole thing
crashing down so I had the idea to put
everything on the mod mat and
fortunately it's like it's absolutely
like rock-solid now it won't move or
shift or anything like that so very
happy with everything so far how it's
turned out I've got a bunch of little
accessories here that I'm not going to
go into tablet you know SSD things like
that external SSD but that's pretty much
it guys I knew I was gonna forget
something because there's a lot of stuff
here but really quick before I go there
is a xbox360 controller that's kind of
tucked away just behind my monitor so it
doesn't get in the way when I'm not
using it but also offers a quick access
anytime I am needing to pull it out and
whether I'm playing rocket League or you
know GTA 5 or something like that so
that's kind of really convenient to have
right there I do have the wireless
receiver already plugged in in the back
of the computer it's kind of a cable you
know haystack back there but there's not
really too much I can do about that a
lot of it is either just directly behind
the PC or actually tucked away between
the the desktop and the monitor there so
you know what are you gonna do
also hey here's an idea would you guys
want to see me cram all this stuff into
my new carry-on bag right here this is a
og o layover I'm gonna put all this
stuff in the description below guys so
if you're interested in any of this go
ahead and check out the description but
this is an awesome awesome layover bag
and I didn't really plan on showing you
guys packing everything into a bag but
since you're all so cool and I love you
all so much
but that's pretty much it guys that's
that's like the five minute Grand Tour
is probably longer than five minutes
like I tend to ramble but hopefully you
guys got a kick out of it or maybe got
some ideas if you want to implement any
of this stuff for a future land party
that you might be attending one day um
so guys thank you very much for watching
this was a super quick video but you
know I got to get on the plane in a few
hours and packing all that sort of thing
before my wife kills me but yes thank
you guys so much for watching and tuning
in go ahead and toss the top pik toss
the alike a button on me toss it out man
if you enjoyed the video and also feel
free to subscribe for more tech videos
coming really soon I will see you guys
some of you at land syndicate in person
and if not I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
