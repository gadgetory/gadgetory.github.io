tentacles as long or as short as you
want them to be man that's true some
tentacles are longer than others after
all have your own little tentacle porn
enchant it's beautiful
we're starting this episode in a really
weird spot so what's just how you
circumvent the Japanese censorship there
you go
we're gonna hit reset really quick and
welcome everybody to awesome hardware a
live show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware or you can also watch the show
from our respective YouTube channels
we'd like to split the show up into two
halves this week the first half was on
pulse Paul's channel Paul's hardware so
that's already happened you can go ahead
and click the link in my video
description on YouTube and it'll take us
at that side
you're watching Part B side B right now
on my channel so everything's all good
we're on track right now things are
going good we had a good first half of
the show second half this show is gonna
be awesome
and we have lots of things to talk about
crypto mining alright radeon RX vega
doing crazy stuff and mice yeah my
tentacle porn wow so much chemikal porn
in chat Thank You twitch beautiful
Twitter I love you so much you asking
you shell is healed Rijn alright so uh
let's let's see we we this is a tech
show we like to talk about tech news
sometimes and then we also like to have
a few beers hopefully you guys can drink
along with us if you're a legal drinking
age in your country Cheers
we're drinking some Avery brewing a
vanilla bean spouts mmm that's actually
quite good oh my yes delicious quite
good very good premium stuff that
premium stuff and then um let's see we
also we swear occasionally so if you're
not cool with that we apologize in
advance
you know safety ears for the little ones
Hitler around earmuffs send them to the
ear muffs there there you go um other
than that it's a fun love and show
hopefully you guys have a good time
there's seem to be a quite quite a few
first-time viewers in in chat from the
donation since doesn't seem so if this
is your first time welcome aboard
hopefully chat makes you feel welcome
and right at home
we like to have fun and be friendly and
we're just vaguely awkward vaguely
awkward and uncomfortable is also also
accepted that's the ads it's a it's a
form of acceptance as well so welcome
aboard and let's talk about our stores
really quick we are still selling stuff
in our merchandise online stores with a
lot of the tentacles just going strong
only the binding of issac the crying
this is sad panda sad panda tentacle
porn there's a lot of you're getting
really crazy laughing at
fucktards where is Vegas stop drinking
you know you gotta appreciate the
viewers that just want the Fatheads like
just I don't care about this charade
that you've got going on here I don't
care about your antics give me the
freakin info you gotta appreciate them
but we're not gonna do that we're gonna
talk about our stores sorry so I stuff
my store yes buy stuff that's advice if
you need to buy a sweater and a mug if
you want to hear anything about radion
rxp least one of everything I have so
I've got glasses the glasses are
actually a pulse size now they are no
longer this size this is like an early
prototype these they are now full full
big boy twenty ounce glasses and they
drink their hefty kind of a tall boy can
style and yeah their shirts and all that
jazz a lot of stuff has just been
restocked which of these is back I
believe it's this one yeah it's the
middle one
it's jeans is it hey that's a great
mouse there's a fantastic mix I figured
it out there you go my store is also
Arnett I have a polo
I have polo shirts and mugs and pint
glasses and stickers and I have some
lady shirts it's all high quality if you
buy stuff we'll shout out your name and
the word Johnson at the end of the show
it's a sort of creepy ritual and also if
you buy from both of us it'll ship
together and you'll get a refund on part
of your shipping cost and eat it's a
great deal yep
um so let's just dive right into some
tech news starting with actually an
article that Paul already sort of
touched on his half I didn't really
realize that you were talking about I
must have missed it I only lightly
grazed it though yeah
so I guess we can just sort of
rina reach what was said maybe I can
just do more better eBay search as this
time right yes I could I linked from the
article the eBay search and I have no
idea that was only looking at ended
ended so these prices are great it's
like this this our export eighty that
ended three months ago that's a great
price on it totally reasonable
we haven't screwed up that badly since
the one time we pulled up an article
from like 2009 or something yeah
sometimes it's hard it's hard to tell
when articles are written it's like one
of the street along the way should have
realized that that wasn't news yeah say
Instagram you people don't notice that
certain gram becomes a thing as long as
we press press on you know just plow
right through it yep alright so um if
you read prices as we all know have sort
of tanked in the last month it was a
round four valued at $400 around there
together burner bucks in June yeah and a
crushed way down to last last week or so
yeah a little over a week ago is when it
first kind of tanked and that's when the
the difficulty increased right on it
they moved to a new and a new epoch epic
epic epoch ibaka
be Bacchus it's such an awkward word I
know I need to figure out how to
pronounce that one day um but yes so
difficult to increase the the price is
still it's been fluctuating it's still
going up and down right as we might hit
around 250 today right yeah up from 133
so but that could also be you know
because so many people stopped mining
after the initial crash you know what I
mean
so that first crash from less you know
last week going from $400 to around 133
a bunch of people as we were noting on
your half of the show have already begun
selling their used graphics cards and
have sort of you know the less serious
traders are like okay I'm out of the
game whatever I'm not gonna stick around
for and wait for it to go back up my
electricity bills killing me or whatever
it is so that could also be a reason one
of the reasons why it's spiked up to 250
always kind of gone back up a little bit
just this was like hours ago well this
was like mid early afternoon today
depending on where in the US you are
that peaked a little over 250 it is back
down to still about 220 range but I mean
you combine that the price being more in
the 200 ish to $250 range compared to
the 300 400 dollar range when all of the
prices started to being jacked up from
the GPUs and everything like that
combine that with the difficulty going
up and it's just not as effective a way
to make money as it used to be that's
the bottom line yeah and as a result
there's less people who are buying the
cards so there's less demand so the
price should the price of GPUs at least
should start to fall off what does it
mean when they say the difficulty is
increases that just means it's taking
longer to mine the same amount of coin
yes okay so you need to you need to put
in more work and more time with your GPU
in order to find the next next block in
the chain which means which means you're
getting less money per amount of time or
whatever it is PC Gamer actually did an
exam showed an example where a mining
rig sporting one rx 580 would net around
4 bucks a day if you're talking about
about a month ago that same system now
would only be yielding about a dollar 25
per day
so that's a significant decrease in
earnings and there's not as much ROI
there it's a lot of people who are
mining and you know trying to pay off
and try to just break even on the cards
they just spent you know hundreds of
dollars on and you know now increase
their electricity bill are now looking
at it going this is probably not as
worth it as as I thought it was and I'm
not really willing to stick it out in
the long run to see where it's going
this is just sort of the natural ebb and
flow of things and there are gonna be
less serious traders out there who just
don't have the patience for it and we're
just trying to make a quick buck that
obviously may or may not have happened
for them you know they also have fewer
people who aren't familiar with the
general landscape of cryptocurrency in
general because like you'll have people
who don't know anything about
cryptocurrency but who see it as a
potential money-making source so
suddenly they have
gotten into it to try to figure out how
they can put something together to start
mining and making some money if you're
still if you've already got GPUs first
of all and in particular if you're
somewhere where you either have access
to renewable renewable energy either
wind or solar solar or hydro or if
you're somewhere where energy is just
very inexpensive which is probably
because you're getting it from wind or
solar or hydro then it is much much much
more practical to do mining and probably
at least if you're looking at it from a
like am I just wasting tons of energy by
mining perspective makes you feel a
little bit better about it - I've never
done any mining I think probably a lot
of people here in Southern California
would be in the same boat one because
the cost of electricity is so high as it
is so it could have still been
profitable I could have still made some
money by plugging in some cards and
mining it but I'm also chewing into you
know the amount of energy that's used in
in general by the area that I'm in as
it's provided and we are on coal power
here so that's just not something that
I'm very interested in in in doing so as
someone addressed like there's there was
a comments or one of the one of the
donations on my half of the show talking
about people hating on miners and if I
could if I could state well I'm just
here's here's my here's the way I look
at it like we live in a world where it's
very difficult to make money and get
ahead I don't blame anyone who saw
mining as a way to make some money and
got into it because if it is a way to
make money you're gonna have people who
are interested in it yeah I don't I I
think it's actually actually possible to
hold the position of I'm disappointed
that's graphics cards cost so much as
much as they do because I want to build
a gaming PC and I understand people
trying to make a buck yeah I think you
can hold both of those positions at the
same time and I don't think lamenting
the cost the high cost of graphics cards
means that I hate all miners that's not
personal
yeah lady personal it's just it's just
kind of yes I mean and obviously there's
people who might feel differently about
it people might be like miners
they're like you know whatever you know
that guy think bad they're not like the
way this whatever it is it's not like a
bunch of my song it's not like miners
are maliciously mining to undermine haha
those gamers yeah exactly they're done
they're not out to get you they're not
intentionally trying to screw you over
and I think most people realize that but
you know I mean it's it's it's you don't
like the graphics market they don't owe
you anything like there's no there's no
promise that's ever been made to us that
says you will always have an abundant
flow of graphics cards for value for a
reasonable rates like that's not a
promise that we've ever been given like
we're not owe anything so if someone is
by legal means trying to make a buck
with graphics cards you know and it's
not physically hurting anyone just might
make things more inaccessible like
that's not some reason I don't think
personal estate someone also in a quick
reference remember from my half of the
show yeah our expert five 80s still cost
a lot of money there's still not as much
as a gtx 1070 used to cost ten seventies
are the price of ten 80s and higher it's
insane miners all right so yeah
the cheapest buy it now five eighty is a
four gig for 290 bucks Dini mm-hmm
that's I think that's a little bit less
yeah it's a little bit and it's also the
five eighty which is like one of the
prime mining cards yeah 585 7390 yeah I
think eventually it's going to northern
before I go in the lines and we'll be
all right things won't things will
normalize eventually but let's let's
move on because you got some other stuff
to talk about here let's talk about that
was this for the one guy in chat who was
like you guys just talk about our
x-ray Gul ready this is for you
impatient guy this
is about rayon Rx Vega that was recently
showcased at in Budapest of all places
AMD's been making their rounds with
their friends at Asus kind of a dynamic
duo going around the world showing off
their there Vega and their h2 stuff just
like flan at all look at what we got
over there just showcasing stuff they're
doing a tour up and looks pretty sick
what's pretty wicked wicked as I say it
looks like it's like it's on an acid
trip or something yeah it's kind of like
on fire type of thing it looks mean it
looks really mean it's me and aggressive
looks like it's ready to mind some
Bitcoin no I'm just getting ready to
kill some frame rates a photo gallery so
this gives you an idea of what was going
on in Budapest just recently Vega was
being shown off not in physical form the
radian rxt Vega was not physically
visible to the public it was actually
enclosed in a PC that had you know no
visible like open window type side
panels or anything like that so you
could really see it but you got an idea
of the performance because they allowed
the attendees to sort of game on that
particular system with battlefield 1
running the whole system was running
Rison 7 cpu and in close chassis of
course the only demo they had there
really was
battlefield one at 34 40 by 1440 and
beside that Vegas system was an
identical rig with the same Rison 7
processor but instead it had a GTX 1080
from Nvidia inside of it
1080 or 1080 1080 non TI non TI for
comparison ok which immediately makes us
think or sort of assume that the RX Vega
car that they were showcasing there is
gonna be is gonna have comparable
performance to a GTX 1080 potentially
neither system was labeled however so
all the attendees none of the attendees
knew which one was Vega which one was
the the 1080 which is kind of
interesting hmm
and there was no FPS counter on either
system as well so you couldn't even see
like what your frame rate was they were
both you know there was an equivalent
g-sync and freesync monitor on their
respective systems but their's
FPS counter so we don't really have a
metric to to go by on that so there was
any useful information so really it was
just sort of a useless demo that the
only thing you could really construe
from it is that most of the most of the
attendees could not tell a difference
between either system which basically
tells us whether you get a gtx 1080 or
this radeon RX vega card your gameplay
experience to the average user is going
to be more or less identical ok on on
the particular respect hardware that
they had configured which again kind of
kind of makes you a little bit
suspicious like if they were super
confident why didn't they show like why
wasn't there an FPS counter up there i
feel like that's something that they
could have really stuck to nvidia if
they had the means to do so again this
is all speculation
AMD representatives were also telling
the public that their own system with
the with the RX vega card was $300
cheaper actually the whole setup was 300
ollars cheaper than the nvidia does that
up but they're using to calculate that
they're using the average cost of a free
sink monitor versus a jisuk monitor
saying that the average cost is about
$200 cheaper if you go free sync and so
what you can construe from that is that
the RX Vega is potentially about $100
cheaper less than it's an 80 and a 1080
so okay maybe it's got comparable maybe
a little bit less performance of that
and that's the juicy info there's the
juiciness okay there's the juiciness so
for waiting like a bit of flavor so the
gtx 1080 is retailing right now for
about least six I know I'm salivating
right now you were salivating I could
tell you're just drooling all over
yourself look at that paraplegic so um
this has a weird and metaphor highly
offensive
good thing we're not streaming anything
you say under your live to the world
okay
welcome to the show everyone my half can
be in certain ways that pause does not
uh but let's see 100 dollars cheaper I
think that's a pretty good setup even if
it's not quite as powerful as a GTX 1080
hey you should be 500 bucks yeah yeah so
400 bucks maybe for the price of a admin
board gtx 1070 you're getting in our
Vega Iranian rx Vega that performs about
on par with a GTX 1080 that's that's
pretty solid
however at 50 however in video could
also make the argument that Wow AMD just
came out with this card that rivals a
card that we pretty much put out almost
a year ago so this is almost like older
technology and and I guess the question
is like is Vega has Vega come too late
did I just take too long to launch a
vania like now that the plus the GTX
1080 has been out for so long that there
are so many adding board partner
variants of that card that help with the
cooling and the performance and the
overclocking of capabilities of that
particular GPU where I feel like Vega
it's gonna take a while maybe for those
ad and board partners to roll out with
their specific models in order to offer
you know a good selection for well if
the Vega delay has been largely due to
HBM product HBM to production difficulty
then perhaps you know the board the atom
party Edden board vendor third party
people there's so many ways to say it
perhaps the third party GPU manufactures
graphics card manufacturers will already
have had time to work on something so
maybe we hope maybe we'll see
third-party designs or sooner rather
than later I mean great what I'm trying
to say we saw some of launcher sin ATM
Newegg right now is 550 bucks
okay so potentially you're talking four
to five hundred dollar range for rx Vega
speculating here but if you can if they
can deliver GT X 1080 performance for
450 bucks they'll have a good product
yeah aim I mean Nvidia can probably
respond pretty quick with a price drop
or something like that because like Kyle
said yeah this their 1080 has already
been out for quite a while yeah
they only dropped the price on it
because the 1080 TI launched it wasn't
due to anything that and that AMD did
right so and then when's the next
generation of Nvidia cards coming out
whenever Alta like whenever they want
yeah like whatever they're not whatever
what's what's AMD doing yeah right they
just got it in the chamber chamber
wait yeah we'll just keep selling those
top-end GTX 10 80s and 1080 TS that's
the best thing anybody has we don't have
we don't have anything Volta based what
do you think Jensen's doing right now
like right in this very second as we
stream this the keys like in his
underwear playing pong like I was gonna
say like getting zero stress zero job
from like three chicks oh yeah and
they're all they're all AMD reps is he
married I have no idea I know nothing I
know more about his leather jacket than
him as a person because if he's not
married then that's totally fine you can
get a blowjob from from two chicks of
course there's nothing in the law in
America that says you can't do that yeah
some people married that'd be kind of
that'd be kind of shitty Yeah right stay
loyal unless he was married to all three
of those women which is which is legal
some some places yeah there's a way that
you could work that out I've looked into
it for a friend he's Mormon switch chat
says they're imagining a lot of ass
 okay sorry we're thanks chat hey
where's the tentacle icon where's the
tentacle emojis when you need them
come on where were you on that twitch
dropping the ball guys let's what's
alright Jensen's actually in chat
spamming okay all right let's move on to
our next story which is completely
different than what we've just been
talking about this is about a science
experiment Thank You tentacle porn chat
users yay so um this is a scientist his
name is Zhao ting ting he's from China I
believe and he's been experimenting on
Mike's trying to turn these these shy
low ranking loser mice into aggressive
like straight-up aggro in your face
winners so straight winners bro so this
is the test that they actually conduct
to see if they're if their tests are
fruitful they basically had it's called
the tube test and they put two mice at
opposite ends inside of a tube and each
might each Mouse tries to get to the
other side and the more aggressive or
more dominant Mouse will always be the
one to push the other Mouse out
the other end and come out on top so you
can see here the one on the left is
clearly more aggressive it's pushing for
a longer period of time the one on the
right is just finally backing out and
going I can't do this your balls are way
bigger than mine and I ain't getting
laid tonight you are look it's a moon
expedition and then there's an
advertisement no they just rolled into
the next video oh thank you very much
more easy technique to see more of this
hot mouse on Mouse action yes it's very
sexy when you think about the brain oh
yeah so basically I'm the way they're
doing this is they're stimulating a part
of the mouse's brain that it's like
they're the prefrontal cortex that's in
charge of effortful behavior they have
that in quotes effortful behavior which
have turned these shy low-ranking mice
again into these super soldier mice who
are super dominant and have actually
shown to win the tube test nearly 100
percent of the time they went from
almost losing every single time to
almost winning every single time which
is pretty good saying something
apparently you know who wins the tube
test 100% of the time you know did tube
does this this is a pun that I'm not
picking up on right now I just thought
you might say me or something like that
oh why would you be not winning this I
mean like you I was trying I was I was
leaving you an opening oh but me but
that's the actual answer is me you
you're not winning the tube test and I
do you do in the tube test have a
champion at the tube test so who's the
other person in the tube with you
doesn't matter
that was win all right right yeah I
guess you're right
you know they're a loser it's my
dominant personality that is true very
alpha it's nothing very overbearing just
just just just oozing intimidation if
you walk into the room with bog yeah
I've got a kit don't make eye contact me
Dee Utley do whatever I will without you
telling this I can I can testify to that
so the wit the winning mice yeah they're
awesome and they're they're they're
they're a sign that this is this is that
you can that you can win in life you
don't even have to be
wrong you don't have to be you don't
have to be like the bronze you have to
have like brute strength to overcome
certain obstacles in life you just need
to have an aggressive attitude so I
guess maybe this is a sort of a
technique of the will the will the drive
right to to overcome and I think that
there's something that can be applied to
the human race in this regard
perhaps this sort of treatment of
stimulating that part of the brain it's
probably like we're not gonna respond
the same way that the mice are because
our brains are infinitely more complex
than a mouse brain but this could
potentially some way down somewhere down
the line be be it be a solution to like
anxiety like social anxiety for example
I think the most fascinating thing about
this article is that some of the mice
that were treated with the stimulation
why are you laughing what's going on I
have to I have to know its to know
what's in that sick brain ears that's
sick mouse brain ears them because if
you're like simulating and I have to
refresh this like actually show it
because if you're naturally like
socially anxious person or something
like that what's gonna make you feel
better like walking into that the club
or whatever we're just like this big
light array sticking out of the back of
your head that's what you get to do get
the cover you see the person with the
big light ponytail he's only your only
real man could we're late array of
optical wiring sticking out of the back
of this juice guy that dude's got two
penises holy he's got a double
Johnson so what I was gonna say what I
was saying was that some of the mice
that were treated six or seven times
with this stimulating effect on their
brain actually became permanent for the
entirety of their existence like they
just
just like grew balls and like eyeballs
did my shrink back they got hardwired
into believing that they had the
aggression and the confidence which is
kind of weird to talk about with mice to
to overcome these certain situations and
win the tube test nearly every time
there was a small percentage of mice who
were treated that eventually reverted
back to being meek and shy but most of
them actually liked it almost like
rewired their brains in a way their
brains were like because I think that's
true with human brains too like when you
do something you kind of take a risk and
you be more aggressive and you actually
come out victorious in whatever
situation you're in whether it's like
social or whatever then you know like
for next time I'm capable as a person I
am capable to overcome this and and it
sort of rewires your brain and what you
think is possible which is a huge
mindfuck but again hopefully this can
help some people that were there any
negative effects like did any of the
mice just die oh yeah all all the mice
died at the end of the experiment they
did no oh okay but that seems like a
likely when you first said when you
first look like some of them took it too
far whatever I thought you've a go well
it's like you know it's like the the
stimpacks in in starcraft or whatever
you know it's like eventually will kill
you or something if you use it too much
but if there's no negative effects again
they need to start testing this on
humans as soon as possible but they need
more people out there who are just pushy
and dominant but no that's what we need
no that's see that's the negative
exciting that sounds like a horrible
idea
the negative effect is the effect itself
isn't that we can create and potentially
create a super-soldier army of
douchebaggery assholes that that like
just never back down
bro it's just like constantly like one
I'll just chest-bump everyone out of the
way and you I destroy these scientists
in the facility I prevent anything needs
to be controlled moderated and you know
and sold on the black market eventually
which I'm sure would turn a huge profit
for lots of game shows game shows here
shows yep just having that you know but
ate a bunch of people it's like it's
like it's like a Hunger Games style game
show you know the type of ones where
people fight to the death or whatever
yeah you give them all this type this
treatment first and then they all think
they're king of
world or whatever and they're you know
go out there and dominate and then
obviously you get a bunch of those
personalities clashing they kill each
other it's obviously going to be
fantastic entertainment right everybody
should sign up for my new my new cable
channel I've just decided I'm gonna
start that sounds great mr. cable
neutrality so you fall through that so
um yeah this could be a really great
thing or it could destroy us all you
know I don't want know like the steroids
are already bad enough having people
like just overly charge like overclocked
like your aggressions just been
ridiculously overclocked to the nth
degree that sounds terrible and and you
know what there's there's bound to be
some negative effects that they're not
talking about in this article anything
that's like this just it's too good to
be true sounding has to have some
negative effect like that's why we don't
all do cocaine it'll be like sickness is
basically cocaine
there's a nice cocaine so at the end of
it all demise for assholes yeah right
that also happened nine out of ten mice
who use this treatment ended their
marriages and divorces dicks mice no one
wants a dick mouse alright let's move on
to our last story here for tech news
today about Google is a quick one Google
bringing 4k HDR to the playing field
with their play movie store yeah they've
uh they've been offering 4k content in
the past for a while now but now it's
getting the HDR treatment in their play
movie store which is super cool this is
gonna allow a lot of users to stream 4k
HDR content to compatible devices
whether that means a smart TV or this
beautiful contraption here which is I
believe the chromecast ultra it's one of
the new chromecast chromecast ultra
makes me feel dated for just having a
basic chromecast this is only available
currently to users in the US and Canada
and the Canadians but it will roll out
to other countries later on those this
is a cool thing if you already own any
4k content specifically I think it says
4k films if you own any if you own any
4k films in the Play Store like oh and
the Play Store from the Play Store that
you purchased in the past you'll be able
to access
their HDR versions for free that's cool
so they don't they don't charge you
extra they don't up charge you if you
already own it you just get the HDR we
used to be like oh by the DVD like oh I
have the DVD of this my foot no that's
alright say let's go back further by the
VHS oh okay and I have the VHS to the
pre DVD right by the DVD now your VHS
sucks okay I'll buy that movie again on
your video okay and if you murmur that
all right the blue my movie again on
blu-ray available now anyway no don't
want that shitty DVD quality you want
blu-ray yeah well that's easy
let's look great nothing by it again on
4k blu-ray 4k blu-ray of HDR buy that
 one more time yeah this is better
if you just buy it once and then the
service upgrades if the service upgrades
and then like in in five more years when
they're doing 8k double HDR broadcast
was twice as much HDR at each one
because it's quantitive thing you can
add more of it then it just suddenly
your movie becomes that much better
that's that's the beauty of having I
don't way of doing things that's the
beauty of having it all did you tie so
everyone go buy all your movies again on
Google Play yes indeed and I promise
it'll be the last time yep I'm gonna get
a chromecast all true it sounds cool
really it didn't have a home theater PC
you think I do but when I you know when
we travel and stuff it's it's nice
oh yeah for traveling it's nice I mean
it's cheap to exact 20 30 bucks
I'm tired of bringing my htpc to Taiwan
I'm just kidding how to do that
that would be ridiculous alright let's
move on to our next segment
Hutton heavy hardware yeah we've got a
couple stories here not too much
so our first article comes from PC gamer
thank you very much this is about a 50
terabyte
solid-state drive did you know that
there was a 50 terabyte SSD in
circulation right now that's reasonable
um sounds legit to me this is from
Viking technology when I first read this
article I thought there was a new
technology that was being built into
SSDs called Viking technology I was like
what an interesting technology no that's
name of the company
I was just as confusing so Viking
technology is who makes these SSDs
there's also a 25 terabytes hero laser
then what was the president's name but
oh look at the name of the president of
Viking technology that's a Viking named
honeyed shucks shucks Ergas r is that
Viking I'm gonna pretend that's a Viking
name he's definitely a like it could be
advising definitely if I there's no
other reason why you name your company
that there's no so so quote from the
president of Viking technology there is
no higher capacity SSD solution
available today in the you says it needs
to cut too like the dude interviewing
him and him just being there's like the
word bull get up wearing like you know
animal furs and Viking stuff and okay uh
yes that's what I imagined in my head
yep me too so this is part of their both
of these drives at 25 terabyte and the
50 terabyte model are part of the
brand's ultra high capacity silo series
and come in a not 2.5 but 3.5 inch form
factor this is intended for data centers
which probably many of you guys already
assumed not general consumers that would
be incredibly expensive if you made a
general consumer drive with this kind of
capacity so these ones actually support
a 60 bits per second this is the
thickness over in the right yes like a
big fat big old drive big that point SSD
yeah still get them SATA connect it's a
it's got a SAS interface so you could
not just you need a card or something
like that madam card so yeah to make
this way their rate card of something
SAS compatible or a server motherboard
to give that in mmm-hmm the dredger
using planar multi-level cell man and an
undisclosed next generation flash
processor speeds are not amazing they're
500 megabits per mega bytes per second
sequential read and 350 megabytes per
second two sequential writes random
reads reads and writes up to sixty ki
ops and 10,000 I ops respectively
endurance Viking technology it's not the
best right however this is more so I
guess if you want just like the most
ridiculous capacity
they and you know having that additional
right speed is not about most importance
you know everyone I'm sure even you know
servers like data centers have their own
specific needs where I mean that's he's
way more important to write speeds what
one don't get me wrong
oh yeah it would be awesome I'd love
this for everything or something I'd
never have to you know transfer the
files to a backup drive or whatever just
get tutors because I you're sitting here
thinking like only 500 megabytes per
seconds to clinch to read and be
terrified bytes like it's plenty like
it's been really really high-end pretty
expensive hard drive yeah you'll be
lucky to get a 10 terabyte one right now
yeah okay yep you know unfortunately a
consumer SSD in this type of capacity
probably won't come anytime soon because
it would just be so expensive that it
wouldn't be practical and no one would
buy it so a company would only do it
just to you know as a benchmark and be
like we're the best that we have we
broke a world record or whatever but not
really to sell any units they probably
wouldn't sell so respectfully trying to
keep our sockets in our our eyes in our
sockets Viking did not mention price I
would imagine it's over what do you
think a ten or a fifty terabyte SSD
retails for well ten like fifteen
thousand dollars let's let's look at
teen or twenty thousand let's look at
best-case scenario okay so if we looked
at a one terabyte lookup a one terabyte
Samsung I don't care what the capacity
is I'm looking at price per gigabyte per
expert a gig so pptv best price per
gigabytes for this is only PC part
picture so he's not exhaustive but
basically 25 cents per gig times and
that is four by two that's it Wow that's
actually for a two terabyte crucial MX
300 basically the same price per gig for
the one and two terabyte versions of the
MX term that would be twelve hundred
twelve thousand twelve thousand five
hundred dollars that's if you could get
the best price per gigabyte for
sumer drives on the market right now
which I almost guarantee that's not
gonna happen you're probably looking at
15k at least yeah so yeah 15 to 25 K
crazy for this Drive imagine that
someone will buy it not me oh yeah well
datacenters yep
of course cuz I mean just out of
space that uses and and it's gonna use a
lot less power than I McKenna need rep
to or the set up oh yeah or the set of
mechanical drives that you would have
needed to definitely have made got an
equivalent capacity yeah so cool thanks
Viking technology for that
cool cool those cool products next up
we've got a story about oculus good ol
oculus working on a standalone VR
headset that will be $200 reportedly
this is all from a Bloomberg report this
is all rumored people but it's been
everywhere every site I looked at today
was talking about this it's melting all
over the place it's called the oculus
Pacific for now which is basically a
stopgap sort of bridges the gap between
Mobile Smartphone VR it kind of sucks
and super high-end VR that has a really
high barrier to entry because it
requires a super fast PC just to make it
operate and function properly so this
actually is requiring no additional
hardware it's a standalone hmd you don't
need a PC to drive it which is gonna
appeal to a lot of people because there
are a lot of people out there who are
indicating who are interested in VR but
know nothing about building their own PC
or don't want to buy or fork out the
money for a high-end system so that this
is potentially this might be more
popular than the oculus rift to be
honest who knows hello yeah exactly
it's not saying much right so this is
gonna be lighter than the rift this is
again all a legend rumor the speculation
lighter than the rift and the Samsung
gear VR headset will support a faster
unspecified Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU no
positional tracking will be offered like
it is on the Google daydream for example
however positional tracking may come
with a 2.0 version
of Pacific's so maybe on the second
generation we might see it happen but it
will become it will it will come
included with a wireless remote and
launch time is projected to be October
of this year if there's any if this is
if this is any truth if there's any
truth to this story an unveiling would
potentially take place during the firm's
oculus connect for event on October 11th
and 12th what do you think about a $200
standalone VR headset oh I'm skeptical I
gotta say I'm skeptical
mainly because 200 bucks standalone I
mean it's gonna be more about the exam
areas and less about the performance
yeah imagine what you could like if you
just bought a phone right now and you
were like I have 200 bucks
I need to buy phone yeah you can
actually get a pretty decent phone for
200 bucks straight across especially if
you're looking at refurbs or something
like that so you can get a reasonable
amount of power and a decent screen for
roughly that price range but I feel like
to have everything included with the
head mounted display like and it's gonna
be something that's Android based so you
know it's not it doesn't seem like it's
something that's gonna suddenly have
access to the entire library of oculus
rift games no there's something like
that right so I don't know I would be I
guess I guess to me for the price right
the price seems like what they need to
do if they really want to say look
here's something you can just buy and
use yeah but it also seems like really
challenging to get the level of
performance out of something that would
cost that little right yeah cuz it's cuz
everybody I mean it's everything it's
it's it's a couple displays if not a
single split display and my sound and
the processing and everything all
integrated I'd be pretty impressed I
guess I'd be curious to see how much
overhead is reduced by using the fovea
'td rendering that we talked about with
prior like how much that actually saves
system resources and and what you know
how much can you get away with by using
that technology 24/7 if that's if that's
the way that things are headed but I
agree that $200 for a VR headset seems
like it might be closer of an experience
to a mobile VR
yeah like Samsung QA should be our or
whatever and further away from the
high-end rift and and and vive in which
case like if it doesn't have enough to
differentiate itself from the experience
of like that Google cardboard or
something where you're just using your
cell phone and putting it in your in
front area switch right I mean for what
it's worth isn't a terrible experience
when you when you try those out I mean
if you're just doing something like
looking at a 360 image or something like
that you know those aren't terrible or
anything but when you compare them to
the like spatial awareness and
interactivity of the full VR experience
that you get with something like you're
an oculus rift or vive it's you know you
can see where there's a big difference
between right a and B so like what this
seems like to me and what I hope it
doesn't become is when you look at
gaming let's just say like ignore PC
gaming for a moment but you have like
mobile gaming on your phone right you
can load up clash of clans or something
right that's a that's an experience and
then you've got the console like lady
you buy an xbox one and you can play it
that's infinitely better right then then
playing on your phone but then there's
like the Android console right which is
much closer in a way like just in terms
of the experience to a mobile device
than it is to the Xbox one so I feel
like that's why I like Android consoles
haven't really taken off much is because
there's not like you said much to
differentiate it from something you can
just get from your phone where it's like
okay now it's on the bigger screen great
but I would say that I hope it doesn't I
know I wanted that category I know there
is a pretty I mean it's it's a little
bit more niche but like Nvidia shield
for example I think would be good it
does so much more than that though which
but it does do more but it also ties in
with your home theater so suddenly you
have whatever size 4k or nice whatever
TV you have is suddenly what that's
using as a display
right that's where this might fall short
is like you know to have a good display
experience as well as the GPU power to
power something like that depending that
resolution and everything that's going
on yeah is very challenging so I don't
know it seems like it would be difficult
for ACOs to distinguish this from the
experience that people get with
something like a smartphone
mm-hm and if they can't do that then
it's like well why would I buy this yeah
when I can get something similar with my
smartphone and you know I'm not gonna
buy this one-off device that I'm gonna
use for a little bit and then get rid of
writers or get bored of or whatever but
I could be totally wrong I mean 200
bucks maybe 200 bucks is a sweet spot
for people and there's a lot of interest
in VR but people have just been like
it's too expensive and this I'll try for
30 bucks yeah I'll be curious to see
what the sort of like game offerings are
gonna be on this platform as well like
like you said you'd probably be able to
pull every title that's available on the
oculus store right now so is it gonna be
significantly watered down are you gonna
have just like a few basic apps that you
can try out at first and you know that
are gonna be less enjoyable less less
fun less exciting and stuff like that
it'll be interesting to see but you know
oh I'll keep an open mind for now and
our last story let's move on our last
story in hot and heavy hardware today
which is about some custom key caps for
your canticle keyboard this is from
hexxus dotnet thank you guys these key
caps are actually pretty sweet at first
I looked at this article is like this is
stupid am I gonna talk about this I was
like it's actually pretty cool I'd
probably use one of those this is from a
Vietnam based company called jelly key
they've unveiled their forbidden realms
series of custom cherry MX key caps
forged by skilled craft workers now
these key caps reproduce scenes from a
forgotten world this is quoted from that
from a forgotten world sealed under
crystal-clear resin and mounted on a
cherry MX compatible key base that's
crazy it's pretty sweet actually based
upon the si ro 3 cap the jelly key will
be a little taller than a regular om key
cap on the top row materials used to
create these key caps include
multi-layered wood veneers grass smoke
and more under a resin of course some of
the key caps are made with black
aluminum sorry back backlit illumination
in mine so perhaps you can even search
sort of illuminate the scenery with a
backlit keyboard which is kind of cool
like it kind of shine through yeah
exactly
um so you can see there's like sort of
like this sort of like a river river
going through a valley up here yeah some
some greenery some some nice wildlife
and those are the layers of
multi-layered wood kind of um that's
wood yeah the bass like the sort of the
foundation is wood I mean it looks very
like detailed yeah Airy detail-oriented
for sure because I get these waterfalls
and waterways flowing yeah yeah they
said it was made with smoke like some of
them are made with smoke this I don't
even know one looks really cool how do
you capture an oak in like an acrylic I
heard jelly whatever jelly they're using
the resin resin I I don't know they just
look really cool like that's something
that I that's different like super
different people in chatter saying like
holy like my mind is blown this is
super different yep I think it's pretty
cool I don't know if there's a this is
the last article I was researching so I
didn't see if there was a price doesn't
look like there is so the big they're
being given away on various social media
channels used by jelly ki okay so you
can follow jelly ki on Twitter or
something like that maybe Instagram and
and potentially win some of these but
I'd be curious to see how much they're
going for this seems like a perfect mass
drop opportunity like mass trap should
definitely get in touch with jelly ki
and just yeah drop some of these guys
for the for the masses because I'm sure
that there's there's going to be quite a
demand since school previous jelly ki
creations would have cost thirty to
forty dollars per key but as the
forbidden realm series is the most
intricate yet the price is expected to
reflect this oh my god might be as much
as sixty bucks per key cap Wow
worth it Wow dear Santa that's like
birthday Christmas
every special holiday about you know
where you get gifts just just ask for
one key cap per person just by make you
get you get we're pretty cool though I'd
like to I'd like to pimp out all my F
keys with just like jelly keys
they'll be pretty sweet all right so I'd
be down for that standard layout is 84
keys and then an enhanced layout with a
numpad is 101 keys so if it was 101
times 60 bucks base about $6,000 did you
imagine like that's like the most pimp
keyboard like he did every key yeah if
you did every key and these would be
different to make an entire 3d scene on
your keyboard
it'd be amazing I'd never bring that to
a land party oh no Melissa had like like
ten Kensington lock so neatly but yeah
but it's it's very very cool pretty cool
pretty good stuff so um that's pretty
much that
how much was the spacebar key B that
would look sick though just a space just
the space bar yeah I like on the whole
keyboard we have full scene on it you
know that would be with little nights
writing to save like a princess from a
dragon oh yeah I'd spend a hundred
dollars on that because I know like and
no one else is gonna have that oh yeah I
would do it I just throw it down give me
that anyway
anyway that's gonna conclude if rotten
heavy hardware good we have one more
segment it is XX e we have one more
segment to go over before we do we read
off donations for this half of the show
which is face off voice oh this is a
segment where Paul and I go head to head
and a oftentimes a crappy to to play
your online game to members and even
this is tube jumpers oh wait we did this
last week we did let's do it again okay
let's do it again
 it the punishment is gonna be loser
s to chug a beer so so here's the thing
since I since then Simon I'm the home
team I will chug the full
beer should I lose and since you have to
drive home you only have to chug half a
beer okay if that's acceptable to you
super acceptable okay that's good
 it we'll do it live
you got it players all right
tube jumpers two jumpers is quickly
becoming the official game of awesome
hardware oh yeah the color
I think we did red and blue right cuz it
was like Intel versus a measly lb order
the codes they got there right now
no yeah yeah yeah I'll be Nvidia yeah oh
there we go
do you remember the buttons don't it'll
tell you only one but it don't tell you
press press it so I'm I W alright it was
a trick what was the trick there was a
trick mmm-hmm so I and W they actually
make you jump and then also go forward
and go forward yeah so I so you would
press W to jump and then when you're
airborne
you can press you can mash W again to
kind of push your character forward so
that he doesn't fall behind and fall off
of the okay so he doesn't land off of
your little platform very I think I'm
pretty sure okay we'll figure it out
so um let's do first to what five okay
first of five no is that too much best
three of five best 35 okay here we go
ready yes
okay oh wow
so sit around that's right you don't
actually need to jump the little humps
that we go over will pop us up in the
air
automatically okay high CPU usage
detected I really need to swap out that
i-5 for an i7 yeah you really especially
because we're streaming at 60fps right
now
yeah sorry of the bit rates really low
from guys affecting things sorry alright
okay I'm at the front now oh it changed
yep yep that's another thing that's a
thing you got a count for it's a beach
ball Oh a big one big big old Kahuna I
went too far
Wow what happens if I how are you so
good at this I don't know what happens
if I land on a raft
mind blown it's a great question I'm
gonna try that I'm ready
all right oh oh yeah there's like
obstacles I gotta be lying down when
you're lying down that's it's the most
ideal oh
there's things here that's a big that's
a big way oh my god why am i so high oh
wait I'm green or night wait have I
seriously with you I've been looking at
you the whole time you were this guy the
whole time I was you just lost your inch
okay it's two to one now rule one know
who you are okay I'm okay I'm okay it's
weird because like like we're wearing
different colors and our boats are also
different another change that was a
black guy last time yeah the skin colour
like that happens they're not racist or
anything but don't change my skin game
sounds super racist doesn't it alright I
think you're getting a hang of it though
trying to put up a little bit more of a
fight than I did oh
you know what would do really well in
this particular game is one of those
analog is one of those analog keyboards
what you're probably right now shark
just you up oh my god Mike I was
I was on my thing I was safely nestled
inside of my little boat on it and it
just bring it on chat up and killed me
you should've been prepared for the
shirt so what is it is it to to to now
to to Jesus for all the marbles
alright here we go I am the black guy
again you're a black guy means you die
first
nope that's how it used to be good what
are you 17 bitch yeah black guys stand a
chance
what is the beach ball do I feel like I
know which ball just throws you obvious
bonus or something it just makes you
wanna party oh oh oh no no that was a
large way Wow I just I'm getting vertigo
I just spun out it's lazy you didn't
feel that humph before I did was a major
kids well there you go folks
I win tube jumpers yet again to time to
jumper champion I don't have half a beer
to drink I will finish this for sure
okay
fair enough and because I'm a good sport
I'll kill the rest of my beer
I believe we have a new castle over here
as well I drink that much more
that was that was our tube test all
right Paul this is a tubular Cheers
test Cheers all done I'm just gonna
think it's my best but you have to choke
solid chug solid Joe thank you
I mean is the tube jumpers some more yep
it'll tube jumpers we'll be back it's
like it should know seems like it should
be good she'll be all right so I think
on that note we can start taking some
donations you guys have lit it up here
so let's see where where Paul's
donations and then mine begin no wait
are they seeing it
or you say maybe I just didn't get any
donations no I know it's which is over
up at some point but I'm just blind here
there's David Brooks there's oh yeah
David Brooks I think that David Rees
alright Demetri for the ten British
pounds donated the Paul last time
thought I'd share the wealth
Thank You Dimitri loved the content you
both produce and butchering my name made
my night
no it didn't Grum ramose didn't it's so
far off it's like the most American way
we can pronounce it cheers guys and keep
those vids coming cheers to you as well
Dimitri hopefully you're pronouncing
your first name right I think we got me
actually at least we have done yeah
I know a Dimitri thanks to me tree El
Jefe reviews once again $5 donation
gentlemen what is your favorite type of
beer IPA 1/2 stout kingcobra malt liquor
oh ok inquiring minds want to know
salute amigos
thanks f8 um what's your favorite type
of beer my favorite beer type I mean if
I had to choose I'd probably like brown
ale and I mean I'm I find that there's
quite a few of those that I enjoy but I
like brown amber blonde I like lots of
different types of ales like Porter yeah
I like stout yeah I would say I'm not a
big eye-dea gambler but that's but
that's well then yeah I don't hate IPAs
I just not my favorite okay hard grudge
against me I like stouts Porter's Browns
Reds and IPAs I'd say those are my
favorite five I think that was five
glorious uh Phoebe my supposed to do I
have I like Locke backed myself into
this corner have I painted eyes out of
this corner where I don't have to your
force announced all of his in an accent
dhf with the $5 I cannot stay
I'll put the gym to curl into squat rack
squat at the bench press and the dead
the rift in the walkway get good at a P
P P P you BB a prayer I Ronin
battleground
pick up pick up pick up grounds you
tried that right yeah yeah the other
night you tried it's fun it was a lot of
fun actually died um it's definitely
more polished than h1z1 kind of a
different game entirely but a lot of
similarities okay and honestly I already
kind of liked it within the first two
hours of playing it so I'd imagine I get
I'd become even more fond of it had I
actually yeah learned the the
fundamentals of how to play the game
because it was literally our first time
playing we didn't know anything so it's
pretty cool though
I played Grand Theft Auto 5 earlier
today for some testing and I was like
heaven forever
I know classic thank you very much
Stevie maybe those locks for the towns
from the 10 a guys I have a 10 korzy on
in an ex 99 I'm mostly multitask and
media but want more than 2.5 gigahertz
on turbo for occasional gaming should I
now go AMD or should maybe I just got an
Intel 6900 CPU Cheers
wait you just overclocking it higher
than 2.5 Xeon oh is he on sorry yeah
yeah I would say since X 299 just
launched to keep like a close watch on
eBay and other secondhand sites for
worse counts on inexpensive 6000 series
X 99 compatible processors because you
could theoretically get something like I
don't say like 59 60 X 60 900k something
like that yeah I mean you might be able
to find yourself a good deal from
someone who's trying to get rid of their
old chip to upgrade or something outside
of that I'd say I don't know I don't
know you could you got a 10 core Xeon
it's hard to say get rid of that 10 core
Xeon for much that isn't going to be at
least 10 core so ya know once you want
to just sell all your x99 stuff and
buying the thread ripper or something
yeah sure I mean at least hang out and
keep an eye on thread river that could
be a viable option yeah
seems to be running in a bit higher
frequency mm-hmm so yeah
Scot filmic 6.66 cents you guys need to
how you a bit wit versus Paul's Hardware
build off and Kyle's grandfather can be
the celebrity judge and make cheater
puns okay that's the best idea I've ever
heard I like it yeah as long as he can
wear his pimp out we make it happen yes
we'll all be in pimp outfits actually
maybe we'll be in onesies my grandpa can
be a pimp outfit and and we'll just
should I'll rent like 50 kittens because
it's the internet and just 50 kittens
will just be in the room with us as we
try to build and they'll be like hopping
on top like into the cases that were
like trying to like mount motherboards
into and things like that I think that'd
be a great video
it sounds pretty exciting actually you
there's got to be a company that allows
you to rent up to 50 kittens at a time
if there's gonna be a company that a lot
that does that it would probably be in
this area yeah just for like video
production and stuff like that
totally yeah absolutely kitten kitten
rentals kitten calli brenell's yep if
not will start that will be the kitten
rental company yeah I'll start breeding
my cats a million dollar business idea
right there SG Mansfield for the five
bucks is getting a 34 40 by 1440
ultra-wide a good idea for gaming hurt
the girth can be painful if you're not
prepared would help for coating to the
girth can be painful
actually I it's very wet um make sure
you have space I just published a video
on five things I hate about my predator
x34 ultra wide back there
some people adulterer right now and the
girth was one of those reasons more or
less however if you're just strictly
asking if it's good for gaming I think
it's a great solution as long as your
system can handle those extra pixels the
nice thing about that resolution is that
it's not quite 4k in terms of pixel
count yeah so even if you don't have
like a gtx 1080i or something like that
you can still run it reasonably well
there's not nearly as many pixels in
that resolution
count as 4k and it's cheaper potentially
than a 4k whatever GC monitor I would
say if you're gonna spend the extra
money on that aspect ratio and that
pixel count then get either g-sync or
free sync based on the graphics card
that you're currently using because I
think that's huge
having adaptive vsync is kind of a game
changer
if you're gonna be spending that much on
a monitor you might as well get the
technology built-in as well it's great
for multitasking in some areas you might
find that if you're gonna be mostly
using it for coding over gaming that a
4k monitor might be a better option if
you're gaining like 30% of the time
encoding 70% of the time I would go 4k
because I feel like editing on my ultra
wide is very claustrophobic from a
vertical standpoint I feel like all the
extra pixels you gain with wise you lose
out in a vertical sense and I feel very
like almost like just collapsed and I
feel like I'm in like the trash
compactor in Star Wars where it's like
just closing in every time I look at my
time line and Adobe Premiere Pro and
like yeah there's like so much I can see
35% more of my time lighter than any
given moment
I'm also losing the ability to expand my
tracks when I need to in a vertical
orientation so I I do miss out on the
more traditional aspect ratio for
productivity
you know gaming wives Creative Cloud you
can just mouse over any of the tracks
and scroll your wheel and it'll make it
bigger smaller make the timeline bigger
or smaller no the trek oh the actual
track size yeah but I but I generally
like to sometimes there are certain
situations where I like to max out the
size of all the tracks so I can just
sort of have a comprehensive look at it
well I usually like to be able to see
all the tracks
whatever whatever width I have I like to
be able to see everything like I don't
like scrolling up and down in the audio
yeah yeah the video section right I'm
just saying with Creative Cloud that's
one of the things I like having switched
that from CS there
from cs6 ya is I can just mouse over any
of the tracks on the left side where has
a track head headers yeah and just
scroll the mouse wheel up or down and
it'll middle let's go back a little bit
that's pretty nice but I've tried
Creative Cloud for several months and it
did not work for me in reasons I can't
really get into right now but I ended up
losing a bunch of money on it because
apparently I signed up for like some
sort of year-long contract that they
didn't make super upfront in the first
place and I had to pay like for the
entire year subscription even though I
only used it for like three or four
months but I got on the phone with them
technical support and all that and they
were basically you're wrong you don't
know anything about computers so I was
like yeah okay I'm gonna subscribe from
your service thanks a lot like I called
them five or six times and they were
dicks they were total dicks man I've
never had to deal with Adobe support no
they're horrible
I mean first off they outsourced to
India which is I don't care I don't care
where you're outsourcing all your calls
to if like if I never hear from an
American voice person you know for my
tech support I don't give a as long
as it's decent service but it wasn't it
was just like some guy had like a list
of like bullet points like he had a flow
chart in front of him he's like alright
you say this then I give you this
response but anything outside of that I
cannot I cannot give you any sort of
help and so it was very frustrating I
ended up spending over like I don't know
I feel like over two hours three hours
maybe on phone calls with Adobe trying
to figure it out and CC Creative Cloud
just did not work for me for some reason
so I've reverted back to ca6 maybe I'll
try Creative Cloud again one day but
that was a very interesting story about
me and my experience with I'm sorry they
were dicks yep that sucks they had
gotten the same brain treatment that
those mice got freaking mice let's move
on and yes 16 MB 67 but I digress in
in a sense $20 Kyle thanks for your
dedication to tentacle porn you're very
welcome
seriously thanks for the great content
you provide to us tech heads all got 20
bucks last week so here's your 20 for
your half enjoy a fancy 6-pack of craft
beer on me
Cheers thank thanks MB thanks 67 hell
yeah 67 is my new favorite number right
below 69 nubes for the 10 bucks thank
you guys your videos helped me out with
my rise in 1700 build upgrading from my
FX 4300 from 2012 now I'm helping my
friends with their pcs thanks again keep
it up thumbs up that's that's honestly
what it's all about yeah if Paul and I
can help you guys learn about pcs and
then you can then transfer that it's
like yeah it's like paying it forward
right type of thing so whole world will
be smart PC master race yes will be all
of us TC masters and then there will be
like no inferior race though at that
point so then it'd just be like PC race
we need to make up other reasons to look
down on people
yeah well exact well we'll exile certain
PC master-race urge that aren't you know
carrying their weight and yeah let's see
we'll get in $10 thank you I just
learned that you only respond with five
dollars or more put that in the
description below anyway should I
replace my fans of quiet ones or start
water cooling if I should stick with the
fans which ones hmm let's see
if all you care is about is things being
quiet then yes replacing your fans with
quiet ones would be a good idea yeah if
you want to blow in temperate dynamic
bearing fans are particularly a favorite
of mine maglev fans also good options
there are available from various
manufacturers coursers got a lineup for
those if you want really really nice
fans that might not look all that great
Noctua if you want really good fans that
still look pretty good knock to an
industrial series the Frank Levin
thérèse that are in hot line right now
Frank Levin Therese really likes a good
job there's lots of nice fans out there
it's just like for the nicer fans that
have better better motors and better
bearings you typically have to spend
more money yeah
so usually it's gonna be like you know
15 to 20 ish dollars maybe 20 to 25 per
per 120 to 140 millimeter fan yeah
that's just kind of how it goes but once
you upgrade your system fans to fans
like that Google finds that you have a
much quieter experience especially if
you do something like it fans that have
4-pin pwm connectors that you can plug
it all into your motherboard and have
your motherboard do the fan speed
control on them and that kind of thing
that's a good option water cooling I
would only go into if you've got extra
money to spare that you don't care about
and if you just want to like a trick
you're making just yeah if you're just
looking for the step up to the next
level yeah water cooling simply to make
things quieter I think is not the most
practical no you can make it quiet
enough rig without custom water cooling
anything like that
demo Johnny 7 cents nice that's all he
says nice well nice back at saxena very
much a demo Johnny again for the five
dollars in three so three
let me get Oh boneless hardware with a
side of hair that's verbatim what the
message says I don't know what that be
what he said he's high yeah probably
must be super high I want I'll take what
he's having
yep that's that's what I want Steven
hill for the $20 been a while
figured I would send some financial love
your way Paul sorry I couldn't catch
your half that's okay Steven Steven you
you're you're in the clear man you're
one of the rigs
you're you're on the Reg list like

us money weekly and you're like in it's
a circle let's all take you there cash
to amaze regular cash donations
we get it you get the love all right
Jordan stump for the $5 so last episode
pimp my PC you guys entirely avoided my
piece see and judge the desk with the
hot chocolate mix what that's an
original H 100 I like Jordan you are
absolutely 100% correct made totally
trolled your system it was fun for the
walls that was one of the best honestly
though you can take credit for having
one of the most interesting pin my PC
submissions yeah because that was
hilarious
just like that hot chunk we talk about
the hot choco for like an hour
make that investigate that further Thank
You Jordan
you set a trend for all future pin my PC
submissions they're all gonna have just
little fun Easter eggs in the background
Jordan we love you thank you hopefully
you don't take it too harshly and thank
you for the day I'm glad your original H
100 is still alive and kickin yeah cuz
mine certainly not um Mike deeds for the
5 bucks no reliable would you say an
external USB powered hard drive would be
to store my videos for like forever
um as reliable as a single hard drive is
which is you know reasonably reliable
but you know if it dies inevitably does
it dies your stuff is gone so I could I
would say to ya whether it's external or
internal or like one internal one
external whatever just as long as this
two drives
yeah just have it on two drives and then
you're not completely safe your
could still burn down if you have both
drives in the same place or whatever but
but at least if one drive dies you still
have the other drive yeah that's not a
it's it's a better backup solution that
a lot of people have I will put it that
way
definitely crafty hack for the five
bucks you guys should you guys really
should not have an after party reverse
psychology this time but really after
party so um I'm gonna say potentially
which is the most ambiguous response I
can offer I understand and it sort of it
sort of boils down to wifey sauce - yes
I'm gonna blame the wife and put it all
on her me - um no that's well after we
have dinner after she makes me dinner
and eat it
I will ask her do you feel like playing
video games with people and if she says
yes then I will join her if she says no
I will join her on the couch and we'll
just Netflix for the rest of the night
so that's that's where I lie on that who
knows maybe I can convince her to play
some battlegrounds again because see I
don't even have that option because my
wife doesn't go and play the video games
with people in line with me mm-hmm
I mean she did for a while with some
some overwatch and stuff but she hasn't
been able to as much recently so yeah
it's more challenging to get her
involved yes yeah when I'm back home
after the show's over and I've been gone
it's more about her yeah then it is
that's and I'm blaming my wife - yay
what are wives for anyway biggity bam
$10 of $10 e-news salary dues please
pronounce Aussie as the Aussie in Bosnia
that is the correct pronunciation that
would be better
Aussie Aussie we got ten nosies ten
Aussies for you I cannot do regretting
as good as I can do the Phoebe Chao
that's how bad I do attempted the
Australian accent I see if you're saying
Ozzie you just say Aussie no but just
just that one word makes me want to say
every other word in the sentence in that
way Crocky
it's like yeah anyway we'll try it we'll
do our best Piketty BAM okay well thank
you for the dollar I do Thank You
Brandon Crabtree ten dollars where did
you get the wallpaper that's on your PC
in the background looks pretty sweet
this is a hotline Miami background I
believe if you just google hotline Miami
wallpapers it should pop up honestly
like I don't spend that much time
looking at my backgrounds everyone's
like oh my god how many hours did you
have just been to find that amazing
background like I just a simple Google
search technically
had a thousand potential candidates
narrowed it down over the course of
several months yep I only had a rating
system for all of them entire team
impossible how will this background play
with their reaction will be how will
they see you as a person when they see
your desktop that good alrighty we're
all gonna find the best wallpaper on one
through two one two three go go team go
Ulysses Lera $5.00 finally got my RAM
above 3000 on my r56 200 cheers to you
that's that's actually really nice
feeling this we've all I feel like Paul
and I are both experienced that Ridge
like yeah we got the RAM speed we wanted
it's also a rising if you were an
earlier adapter and you're getting stuff
like the visa updates and stuff that
they're posting to suddenly like
download something that improves your
performance yeah like that's always
right cool yep
Joel Bell Sita $5 yeah Joe Joe hey I
forgot to mention this was my first time
catching this stream live love you guys
and the work you to do also my name is
pronounced Joel Oh Joe Joel Joel sorry
Joel that we've been pronouncing your
name wrong job but thank you for the
double May examination and welcome
welcome to the live stream it's indeed I
feel like the live stream the catching
it catch catching the show live is is
the way to go because it's there's no
way we would like art like the amount of
interesting things we say just like sort
of decreases if you watch it let's move
on let's move on bub gun 45 pop gun $5
hey Paul and Kyle I love your stuff also
do you agree that fixing an old AF del
with the one core Celeron 4 gig of ram
and all hard drives should I make it a
sleeper PC know anything or anything
Segel core should go in the recycling
bins upgrade your core components to
maybe like a Rison system if you even
got like a maybe an R 540 other case and
a power supply in there that's
functional but
none of those core components or a hard
drive yeah maybe maybe a hard drive for
a backup storage but it looks like your
your you're due for an upgrade like a
massive overhaul it seems like yeah one
core Celeron like that's like a ten year
old system like just just move on and
build something new yeah it's pretty
much for you
Japan girls Japan girl for the five
bucks what GTX Carter Radeon should i
target to play it with good FPS on
higher settings on wow you can get away
with high setting Wow like anything yeah
like seriously like a rich lady Amy you
any discrete graphics card that costs a
hundred bucks or more at this point yeah
will pretty much run while it 1080 no
problem at all
yeah GTX 10:50 on the low end or maybe
even like an RX 5 60 and above yeah
based on your budget and needs yep go
for trivia Jim Jim for the five bucks I
have to 360 by 45 rads to GTX 1080i
Poseidon cards 4770k on water with
Maximus 5 extreme motherboard and using
a d5 pump pump speed that you would
recommend I have no idea good lord to be
honest that's a J question and he'll
probably tell you that pump speed
doesn't really matter or something like
that I I don't know I can't tell you I
don't even know what it like an average
pump speed is 3500 feel like 800 to 1200
rpm I think it's reasonable but again
like never go now said it's not
something that I can answer off the top
of my head is either as well as like
somebody like Jay would as first pump
speed what I was I don't think you have
a pump header on that motherboard either
unfortunately but in maximus v extreme
but depending on the pump connection you
should have either voltage or PWM
control and I would say just run it as
low as our rpm as possible to the header
it's connected to and that's still
giving you decent temperatures because
pumps can make noise if they're running
at higher speeds yeah that's about all I
got I feel like whatever default pump
speed that you're getting once you plug
in to just a regular fan header on your
motherboard is not going to vary that
much
if you really tuned the pump speed I
can't imagine that you're like your
temperature would change more than a
degree or two which hopefully provide
some piece of binders but moving on
CCM 1-0 hey what's up CCM cesium hello
Chris I am with crafty know after party
tonight
