computex 2016 has been overclocked by
gigabyte fantex cable mud ng scale
making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info alright guys
i'm now at the EVGA booth they've got
video cards GTX 1070 who this is
actually the first 1070 that Paul and I
have seen here at computex granite we've
only been 24 booths but this is really
exciting you can see that they've got a
completely new redesigned for their
cooler this is a CX three point 0 which
aims to be ten percent cooler and thirty
percent quieter so a good cooling
performance better cooling performance
as well as acoustics under load you can
see that it's got like a lot of like
metal plating on it and I actually
really like the design along with a mesh
kind of material just really really
stylish kind of looks a little bit
sporty so I'm really liking the metal
design here it's also on the front here
you've got some white LEDs that's are
going to illuminate the EVGA geforce
branding right there and you've also got
you can see here we're basically using a
reference PCB because you've got the the
single 8-pin pca connector get your SLI
fingers you've got a really nice back
play that just comes included with the
card I think that's really nice also
again with a little bit of the mesh
accents their kind of just continuing
the theme pretty beefy heatsink and
actually it's it's got a nice way to it
which I wish I actually like and you got
your pretty much standard configuration
for all your display iOS there why don't
we go ahead and put this down and I will
be right back with another card
alright so now we have pretty much the
exact same card but totally different so
we're still using the AC X pinpoint Oh
cooler here but it's the GTX 1080 so
obviously faster clock speeds better
performance there but pretty much looks
very identical to the 1070 and I still
get the back plates of course by the way
this is a super clock edition actually
probably mention that does come factory
overclocked so you get faster
performance straight out of the box but
of course you can even push that further
in precision for example again single
8-pin PCIe EVGA also has there for the
win addition if you want to crank things
up even further this one features RGB
LEDs on the front as well as on the
front branding right there looks really
beautiful actually it's a slightly
bigger card because they're actually
rocking a custom PCB which is why they
have two 8-pin PCIe connectors on it so
it is going to require a bit more juice
but it's going to get you a bit more
performance out of it as well moving
right along here or next card up is the
GTX 1080 classified and classified has
been around with the EVGA family for
quite some time now but now it's getting
the GTX 1080 treatment so this is just a
beast of a car this is I think it's is
this the same size of the for the win a
little bit bigger it's actually even a
little bit bigger for the than the for
the win edition but still just super
sexy it's got some like red mesh
material on the front there as well as
on the back by the by the back plate as
well you've got a huge two huge fans
that are going to be doing all your
thermal dissipation with those heat
sinks down beneath we also do have two
8-pin PCIe connectors right there for
your power delivery all together an
excellent card but they've even done
some cool tricks with this as well
adding in a power adapter this is the
power link i believe basically what this
does is you can see I've got a live demo
right here I'm all prepared and set up
you plug that in right there to your
PCIe connectors and on the side it's
it's just an adapter so you can actually
plug in your your cables from the side
of the card to give you your entire
system a nice cleaner cable management
treatment there so if you look over here
there's a EVGA logo at the front when
you do plug it in that will actually
light up when powered on and it will
light up white because
I was going to say white power but let's
not go there and then also from EVGA
they've got these new high bandwidth
bridges so these are some these are some
fatty bridges right here right and
they're obviously going to be essential
if you want to take full advantage of
the throughput speeds that SLI is going
to provide you with the GTX 1080 for
example and additionally they're
switching things up quite literally
because there's a switch so you've got
four different colors on this bed bore
you've got white blue green and red RGB
essentially not RG being 16.8 million
color sense but you get red blue green
and white and there's just a switch on
the bottom here you can switch between
them very cool stuff and finally we've
got the hybrid GTX 1080 if you guys are
familiar with the 980 TI hybrid that
EVGA put out just got too long ago very
popular card very well performing
overclocks like a beast and it stays
super cool because it's got an
integrated aio just like this one so
pretty much the same deal here you are
getting super awesome power delivery
you've got two PCIe 8-pin PCIe
connectors there I'm just a beautiful
aesthetic as well you've got a single
fan that kind of a disperses heat from
the inside and exhaust out the back
there may be a little bit out the sides
as well switching gears really quick
here let's take a look at the DG 87 if
you guys watch any my CES coverage from
this year you probably saw this case or
something that looked very similar to it
there's kind of more of a prototype at
that point but now they've made some
revisions taking all the opinions and
feedback from the community and actually
implemented a lot of those changes to
make it more polished and more loveable
case so to speak so it's got a lot of
cool features in it's got full hardware
support it's got hdmi on the front which
really appealed to me because I like
they are so much and now you can
actually link up a VR headset for
example to the front of your case
instead of having to reach behind it's
also got just a lot of air flow in it
comes with 8 fans i believe
pre-installed i also want to mention
that they have a little LED readout at
the bottom of the case and you can
switch between looking at your thermals
or you can change your fan speeds and
things like that which is really handy
there's also a que button so i think the
k boost is essentially going to
overclock your your GPU your cpu and
it's going to ramp up your fans in your
system all at the same time so that's
actually a really cool feature if you're
just looking for a one-stop-shop quick
button to accelerate all the things in
your system but also really exciting was
EB GS pricing on this even though
they're still kind of wrestling with
exactly what they're going to go with
they said the price range but they're
looking at right now is anywhere from
100
72 230 dollars which is really
competitively priced for all the
features you're getting that's pretty
much it for eb g 8 here guys be sure to
check out paul's channel as well he's
got a lot more coverage there but that's
all for now for this video be sure to
like it and stay tuned for more tech
stuff coming really soon to computex
2016 by the way guys my computex
coverage of 2016 is brought to you by
gigabyte g.skill cable maschmann cable
mah jongg cable mod and fans heck yes so
thank you guys for sponsoring this trip
and for making it possible it's been a
really great time if you guys watching
this video want to show them some will
check the links in the description and
i'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
