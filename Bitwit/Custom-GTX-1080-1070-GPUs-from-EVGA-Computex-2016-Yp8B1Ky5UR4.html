Computex 2016 has been overclocked by
gigabyte fantex cable mud and g.skill
making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info all right guys
I'm now at the EVGA booth they've got
video cards gtx 1070 whoo this is
actually the first 1070 that paul and i
have seen here at Computex granite we've
only been to four booths but this is
really exciting you can see they've got
a completely new redesigned for their
cooler this is a CX 3.0 which aims to be
10% cooler and 30% quieter so a good
cooling performance better cooling
performance as well as acoustics under
load you can see that it's got like a
lot of like metal plating on it and I
actually really like the design along
with a mesh kind of material just really
really stylish kind of looks a little
bit sporty so I'm really liking the
metal design here it's also on the front
here you've got some white LEDs that's
are going to illuminate the EVGA GeForce
branding right there and you've also got
you can see here we're basically using a
reference PCB because you've got the the
single 8 pin PCI connector got your SLI
fingers you've got a really nice
backplate that just comes included with
the card and I think that's really nice
also again with a little bit of the mesh
accents they're kind of just continuing
the theme pretty beefy heatsink and
actually it's it's got a nice weight to
it which I which I actually like and you
got your pretty much standard
configuration for all your display i/o
is there why don't we go ahead and put
this down and I will be right back with
another car
all right so now we have pretty much the
exact same card but totally different so
we're still using the AC X pinpoint Oh
cooler here but it's the GTX 1080 so
obviously faster clock speeds better
performance there but pretty much looks
very identical to the 1070 and they
still get the back plates of course by
the way this is a super clock Edition I
should probably mention that does come
factory overclocked so you get faster
performance straight out of the box but
of course you can even push that further
in precision for example again single
eight pin PCIe EVGA also has their for
the win edition if you want to crank
things up even further this one features
RGB LEDs on the front as well as on the
front branding right there looks really
beautiful actually it's it's a slightly
bigger card because they're actually
rocking a custom PCB which is why they
have two eight pin PCIe connectors on it
so it is gonna require a bit more juice
but it's gonna get you a bit more
performance out of it as well moving
right along here our next card up is the
GTX 1080 classified and classified has
been around with the EVGA family for
quite some time now but now it's getting
the GTX 1080 treatment so this is just a
beast of a car this is I think it's is
this the same size as the further win a
little bit bigger it's actually even a
little bit bigger for the than the for
the win edition but still just super
sexy it's got some like red mesh
material on the front there as well as
on the back by the by the back plate as
well you've got huge to huge fans that
are gonna be doing all your thermal
dissipation with those heat sinks jet
down beneath we also do have two 8 pin
PCI connectors right there for your
power delivery altogether an excellent
card but they've even done some cool
tricks with this as well
adding in a power adapter this is the
power link I believe basically what this
does is you can see I've got a live demo
right here I'm all I'm all prepared and
setup plug that in right there to your
PCIe connectors and on the side it's
it's just an adapter so you can actually
plug in your your cables from the side
of the card to give your your entire
system a nice cleaner cable management
treatment there so if you look over here
there's a EVGA logo at the front when
you do plug it in that will actually
light up when powered on and it will
light up white because
I was going to say white power but let's
not go there and then also from EVGA
they've got these new high bandwidth
bridges so these are some these are some
fatty bridges right here alright and
they're obviously going to be essential
if you want to take full advantage of
the throughput speeds
that's SLI is going to provide you with
the GTX 1084 example and additionally
they're switching things up quite
literally because there's a switch so
you've got four different colors on this
bed bore you've got white blue green and
red
RGB essentially not RG being a sixteen
point eight million color sense but you
get red blue green and white and there's
just a switch on the bottom here you can
switch between them very cool stuff and
finally we've got the hybrid GTX 1080
if you guys are familiar with the 980ti
hybrid that EVGA put out it's not too
long ago very popular card very well
performing over clocks like a beast and
it stays super cool because it's got an
integrated AIO
just like this one so pretty much the
same deal here you are getting super
awesome power delivery we've got two
PCIe 8-pin PCIe connectors there I'm
just a beautiful aesthetic as well
you've got a single fan that kind of a
disperses heat from the inside and
exhaust out the back there maybe a
little bit out the sides as well
switching gears really quick here let's
take a look at the DGA t7 if you guys
watch any my CES coverage from this year
you probably saw this case or something
that looked very similar to it there's
kind of more of a prototype at that
point but now that made some revisions
taken all the opinions and feedback from
the community and actually implemented a
lot of those changes to make it more
polished and more lovable case so to
speak so it's got a lot of cool features
in it it's got full hardware support
it's got HDMI on the front which really
appealed to me because I like the ER so
much and now you can actually link up a
VR headset for example to the front of
your case instead of having to reach
behind it's also got just a lot of air
flow in it it comes with eight fans I
believe pre-installed I also want to
mention that they have a little LED
readout at the bottom of the case and
you can switch between looking at your
thermals or you can change your fan
speeds and things like that which is
really handy there's also a K button so
I think the K boost is essentially going
to overclock your your GPU your CPU and
it's going to ramp up your fans in your
system all at the same time so that's
actually a really cool feature if you're
just looking for a one-stop shop quick
button to accelerate all the things in
your system but also really exciting was
EB GS pricing on this even though
they're still kind of wrestling with
exactly what they're gonna go with they
said the price range meant that they're
looking at right now is anywhere from
100
seventy two two hundred and thirty
dollars which is really competitively
priced for all the features you're
getting that's pretty much it for EVGA
here guys be sure to check out Paul
Paul's channel as well he's got a lot
more coverage there but that's all for
now for this video be sure to like it
and stay tuned for more tech stuff
coming really soon to Computex 2016 by
the way guys my Computex coverage of
2016 is brought to you by gigabyte
g.skill cable mashburn cable madjoe
cable mod and fans heck yes so thank you
guys for sponsoring this trip and for
making it possible it's been a really
great time if you guys watching this
video want to show them some will check
the links in the description and I'll
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
