rain first off I just want to say thank
you guys for the support for those of
you who did subscribe and comment and
like my video my first video I just want
to say thanks means a lot it's very
encouraging especially in the early
stages of something like this and I just
want to say I appreciate you but enough
about that crap I'm here to talk about
computers yeah so in the first video I
introduced the channel and I also
introduced my rig to you guys but I
didn't really talk about the peripherals
as many of you mentioned including my
monitor keyboards and stuff like that
so I thought I'd just do a quick little
follow-up video the thing that I like
most in my system right here at home is
audio like I am just a sucker in the
audio department right now as you can
see I have like basically the cheapest
logitech speakers that are on the market
but these things are like 20 bucks and
they just sound terrible I mean it
sounds like I'm crinkling up a candy
wrapper with my but that's not terrible
they are but you know they work when I'm
watching movies or whatever I usually
wear my headset which is a corsair HS 1a
I think somebody pointed that out right
on the money sir and these things are
awesome my only gripe with them is that
they get I get really hot because I
sweat easily I have really thick sweat
glands or something
hyperactive sweat glands but they're
extremely comfortable so I can game for
long hours at a time with these bad boys
on as far as sound card goes I don't
have a sound card right now and to be
honest there's really no point I guess
if I have you know subpar set of cans
and the worst speakers in the world be
kind of a bottleneck but I am planning
on upgrading to maybe a zone RS STX
zoda's STX yeah from Asus my buddy JJ
some of you may know with know of him he
actually recommended that I checked that
out and he's spoken very highly of the
STX so I'm probably gonna get that soon
like I said totally lacking the audio
department it's it's embarrassing quite
frankly but it is the first thing that I
plan on upgrading moving on to the
keyboard I have the CM storm trigger
it's pretty recent just came out not too
long ago and I actually like it it's
fully backlit as you can see in red and
they're Cherry MX brown switches
mechanical keyboard they have a bunch of
other colors as well but I went with the
Browns and my only gripe about these
well what I was hearing a lot of people
complain about was that right out of the
box
there is no windows key this is actually
a cm storm function key that'll focus
and there's no windows key so we have to
do is after you get it you basically
install the trigger software and then
you can like reprogram that key to be a
Windows key and now it works see so
don't let that deter you from getting
this keyboard if it's something you're
interested in I like it a lot and that
brings me to the mouse unlike my crappy
logitech speakers my Logitech G 500 has
been with me every step of the way and
I've loved every waking moment of it
this mouse is awesome
it's just like full-featured has like I
think 10 buttons on it or something but
it's like not overkill like the freaking
Razer Naga it's just what I need has
like weights down there that's your
thing but I really like that Mouse a lot
so I highly recommend it if you're
looking for a new Mouse and moving out
of the monitors let's see you'll stuff
with a crappy one there's a 23 inch LG
it's a 1080p monitor and I don't know
what the refresh rate is I got it like
three or four years ago but it's it
served me pretty well
it's a it's just you know it's basically
the only monitor I had for a long time
until I got this bad boy this is the
Asus 27-inch what is this the VG 2 7 8
and this thing's killer it's a 3d panel
although I don't use it for 3d gaming I
only use it for 2d gaming ABS because 3d
hurts my head for a long periods of time
but it's awesome because it's 144 Hertz
because of his 3d and because of that I
have super smooth frame rates or not
frame rates I should say but I have very
minimal motion blur so especially when
I'm playing fast paced games like
Battlefield 3 or Borderlands 2 I don't
have much motion blur at all which is
pretty nice helps me a play even longer
I think that sums up everything I hope I
wasn't talking guys years off probably
was but yeah that is my little setup at
home this is my throne oh and check out
this awesome table that I got for my
monitor over here it actually came with
my 600 T which is pretty awesome right
bonus but yeah that is my set up for now
and you can look forward to another
video coming very soon hopefully this
video quality is a little bit better
than the last one it's not saying much
but I guarantee you guys it will
continue to improve that's all for now
subscribe if you haven't already you
guys are awesome see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
