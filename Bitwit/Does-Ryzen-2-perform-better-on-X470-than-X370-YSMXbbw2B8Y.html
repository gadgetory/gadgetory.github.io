what's going on guys so Rison 2 is
finally here we're all very excited and
I'm here to talk about that today of
course by now you guys have probably
already seen a ton of reviews and
benchmarks about this launch so instead
of giving you more of the same I decided
to switch things up a little bit
granted I still will be giving you some
benchmarks on the Rison 520 600 X and
how it stacks up against its predecessor
the horizon 5 1600 X but more
importantly I kind of wanted to hone in
on one of the most hyped up features of
this launch in my opinion which is
backwards compatibility for months we've
been hearing all about this like oh
you'll be able to slot a 2000 series
rise and 2 processor inside of your
existing X 370 motherboard and
everything will work just fine assuming
you've got the proper BIOS update and
voila but is there any kind of
performance drop-off from doing that is
there any real reason performance wise
why you would upgrade to an x4 70 board
if you already have an x3 70 board to
get a first impression of how our 2600 X
might behave differently based on the
chipset that's being paired with I set
up two very identical testing
configurations the only difference
between them really being a motherboard
one having the Asus crosshair 7 hero x4
70 board versus the asus rog Strix x3 7
TF gaming motherboard all the other
specs between both systems are identical
including the Wraiths present cooler
that's included with the 2600 X 16 gigs
of g.skill Sniper X ddr4 at 3400 speed
more on memory later and a gtx 1070
bounders Edition running at stock speeds
I should also mention that the 2600 X
was running at its stock out of the box
frequencies during all of these tests
now I began testing the X 470 platform
first and I immediately noticed that
EXIF r2 and precision boost 2 were hard
at work taking all the cores all 6 cores
to anywhere from 4,000 to 42 hundred
megahertz and it was very consistent
almost the entire time that we were that
we were under load we were
at those higher frequencies precision
boost to can kinda be looked at like a
sort of automatic built-in overclock
that will scale your frequencies up as
long as you're operating within the
predefined boundaries that AMD is set
for your thermal and power limits EXIF
r2 works similarly but it takes a look
at your thermal solution so if you have
a big beefy cooler for example on your
cpu EXIF r2 will take that thermal
headroom into consideration and begin
scaling up the frequency across all your
cores not just one or two like we saw
with first gen XF are seeing these
features in action on the X 470 platform
was pretty exciting but it made me
equally concerned that I wouldn't get
that same experience moving to X 370 so
I fired that system up again with the
exact same 2600 X CPU looked at the
results side-by-side and lo and behold
not much had really changed at all our
frequencies across all cores on X 370
we're still in that four thousand to
forty 200 megahertz range our voltages
looked identical across the board which
I guess should be an important reminder
to all of us that EXIF r2 and precision
boost to our technologies that are
inherently built in to the Rison 2
processor they are interwoven into the
Zen Plus core architecture rather than
the chipset itself which is why the
behavior was so similar on our 2600
expert guard list of the platform that
we paired it with this should also mean
and I haven't tested this fully but I'm
assuming that this would also mean you
could slot in a rise in 2 or 2000 series
processor into a be 350 motherboard for
example and still be able to take
advantage of those technologies assuming
that the motherboard manufacturer has
provided the appropriate firmware update
to allow those features to flourish of
course at this point we've only looked
at frequency and voltage and we still
have to look at frame times and frame
rates to see if Rison 2 really can live
on X 370 just the same as it does on X
470 but before we dive into those
numbers one to quickly talk about
overclocking and memory so overclocking
trying to overclock the 2600 X just
didn't really work out for me I tried to
push it to 4.3 gigahertz without
touching the voltage because he never
really had to touch the voltage much
when manually overclocking first gen
Rison so I tried the same approach here
and it didn't work it besought it
immediately and and for the record I
tried 4.3 gigahertz because it was
already peaking up to 4.2
Hertz I don't know if I just got a dud
chip but from looking at some of the
other reviews as well it just so happens
that risin to doesn't have a whole lot
of overclocking sealing there's not a
ton of headroom here so don't expect any
crazy manual overclocking gains on risin
to four now unless you're talking about
some serious cooling solutions like ln2
for example or maybe a custom loop now
memory support and compatibility on
risin to is far superior to what it was
on Rison one where we had to take most
of 2017 for enough BIOS updates to roll
out before we could actually hit the
rated speeds on our memory kits it was a
total show for lack of a better
term whereas Rison 2 is a completely
different story here on launch day first
day first attempt I was able to take our
kit here - it's rated 30 400 megahertz
speed which is fantastic now grad you
still have to jump it at the UEFI and
change your timings and set your voltage
and your frequency so it's not quite as
much of a turnkey solution as Intel's
XMP for example but the Zen + core
definitely makes the whole process of
getting your memory up and running at
its rated frequency a whole lot easier
it's also worth pointing out that I was
able to hit the thirty four hundred
megahertz speed just as easily on our
ROG Strix ex 370 F gaming motherboard
with the 2600 ex further indicating that
the enhanced memory support and
compatibility is really thanks to the
Zen + poor architecture rather than the
X 470 chipset so at this point guys I
think it's time that we take a look at
the actual benchmarks in both gaming and
productivity workloads to see how the
2600 X performs either on X 370 or X 470
if there really is a difference after
all um additionally we're gonna be
testing it against the 1600 X as I
mentioned which will be tested on the
same X 370 motherboard that we saw
earlier so without further ado ladies
and gentleman here are your benchmarks
kicking off things with Cinebench the
2600 X on X 470 beats out the 1600 X in
the single threaded test by 8 point 8
percent and the multi-threaded test by
7.1 percent
when competing against itself in the
older X 370 board the new chip gets an
identical single threaded score and
notably higher marks with the
multi-threaded score perhaps due to BIOS
and Driver maturity but it's hard to say
for sure winning
holding a fork a clip in handbrake risin
to sano performance benefit on x4 70 vs
x3 70 however it did render the file
around 9% faster than the 1600 X in fire
strike extreme the 2600 X on X 470
scores just point 6 percent higher
overall than it does on the year-old
chipset and only 1.5 percent higher than
its predecessor things are looking very
neck-and-neck so far maybe we'll see
some serious gains and ashes of the
singularity or not benchmark to 1920 by
1080 with DirectX 12 this demanding RTS
shows identical performance across all
three test subjects if that's the case
at 1920 by 1080 then the same is
probably true at 1440p and sure enough
it is riveting average FPS remains a
total stalemate in battlefield 1 at 1080
along with 1% lows the only variation we
really see here are the 0.1% lows
clearly favoring X 370 over X 470 and
it's worth noting these tests were run
three times each and averaged out to
ensure the numbers here are repeatable
at 14:40 battlefield one performance is
virtually the same regardless of the CPU
or chipset with the 1600 X is lower 1%
and 0.1% frame times falling within
margin of error in Doom at 1920 by 1080
the 2600 X on X 470 slightly outperforms
itself on X 370 by 2 point one percent
in 1% lows and 5.4 percent in point one
percent lows even on X 370 the new CPU
edges out to 1600 X by around three
percent overall these gains are nothing
to write home about but at least their
gains as you might expect there's little
variation in this title at 14:40 as well
mainly the 1% lows seeming a tad
stronger with Rison - finally we see
some arguably exciting performance gaps
in GTA 5 at 1080 on X 470 the 2600 X
sees a 10.3% uplift and average frame
rates over the 1600 X and 7.2 percent in
1% lows again Rison 2 on X 370 keeps
pace with the latest chipset and even
beats its 0.1% lows by ten point four
percent the gaps close back up at 1440
of course albeit with the 2000 series
ahead by a small margin several trends
begin to solidify here in Metro last
night at 1080
when it comes to average FPS the 2600 ex
could care less what chip said it's on
but slight variation continues to occur
in the 1% in point one percent lows
sometimes favoring the old chipset
sometimes the new meanwhile the 1600 ex
trails closely behind at 1440 the point
1% lows appear to improve significantly
as we climb the ladder but it's worth
noting this benchmark tends to throw out
inconsistent frame times in my
experience so please approach these
numbers with a grain of salt now here's
a look at our frame rates at 1080 which
have been averaged out across all 5
games as of now the chips that you
choose to pair with a 2600 X has very
little performance impact and assuming
the same can be said for higher-end
chips like the Rison 720 700 X this is
potentially great news if you're looking
to upgrade your 1000 series processor
but want to keep your now generation old
motherboard compared to the 1600 X the
2600 X on X for 70s saw marginal gains
ranging from just 2 to 4% which is a tad
disappointing very similar to the slight
performance bumps that Intel's given us
between generations however bear in mind
that performance improvements can be had
well after launch day as the platform
matures let's hope that happens our 1440
averages shows strikingly similar
results between the three setups with
incremental 0.1% low gains for the 2600
X all other frame rates are clustered
together as we become more GPU bound at
the higher resolution summing things up
here the 2600 X offers a modest
performance bump over the 1600 X for a
modest price hike of about $30 u.s.
which i think is a pretty fair deal if
you're building a new Rising 2 system
from scratch then of course go with the
X 470 chipset as that's the one that's
intended for Rison 2 it's optimized for
the architecture and so forth however
you are not really losing out much at
all in my opinion if you have an
existing X 370 board and you want to pop
a rise in to chip in there go ahead and
do it it'll be fun assuming your
motherboard has the latest firmware
you'll still be able to take advantage
of rising 2's higher clock speeds the
smarter algorithms that can
automatically tune up your frequencies
like exif r2 and precision boost - and
of course the greater memory
compatibility and support finally if
you're a first gen Rison 3 or Rison 5
owner looking to upgrade to 2nd gen
Rison I would consider Rison 7 as that
tier will give you access to higher core
in thread counts which should hopefully
deliver enough of a
formants boost to make it worth your
upgrade whereas going from first gen
rising v to second gen rising v is
probably not gonna do you much good but
that's all I got for now guys let me
know what you think of these results in
the comments below and how is resin to
stacking up to your expectations so far
very curious to hear your thoughts guys
