yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo what's up
everyone welcome to boot it episode 4 of
season 5 this is the grand finale the
finale of all finales the show of all
shows this is the final episode not just
of the season but of the entire series
of booted if you guys happen to miss my
channel announcements that I posted mode
a week or two ago probably two weeks now
this I'm canceling the show
simple as that simply so I can free up
some of my time to do other videos focus
more on the review stuff maybe do some
more sketch comedy you know you guys
really like the the GTX 1060 embargo
wrap that I did maybe do some more stuff
like that and I can't really do that
with this awesome show on my plate every
week it is it's been so much fun
I've really enjoyed doing this and you
guys have really made it enjoyable as
well just showing so much support I
would consider this little series here a
huge success I mean I was looking over
the members just the other day and
camping out at like sometimes a thousand
somebody I think one point we hit like
1500 viewers live those are numbers that
rival what Paul and I get on awesome
hardware show that we've been doing for
three if not four times as long so I'm
very happy with how this series has
turned out throughout the course of its
life as short-lived as it may be so I
just want to say thank you in the bottom
of my heart and all that sappy crap for
just uh just for just bringing it for a
shown support and for just tearing up
chat like you guys do so thank you very
very much appreciate it but we have a
show to get on to ladies and gentlemen
this is if you guys are it's kind of
funny if this happens to be the first
episode of Buddha that you're catching
quite ironic but for those of you who
are unfamiliar um every season we would
basically go through a series of 15
different candidates or 15 different
computers and they would get eliminated
off they would get voted off one by one
usually in chunks of four at a time
until there was only three finalists out
of that 15 out of that pool of 15 only
three finalists would make it to the
final round of that particular season or
month and today ladies and gentlemen is
the final round for the East three five
Audio is too quiet for me I can
definitely turn that up boom I've got my
little mixing table here
I bet the mixing table has something to
do with it
boom yo yo yo that wow wow
yippee Oh eb8 thanks Kevin for the
donation and letting me know my audios
off hopefully this fix the issue
wifey sauce will come in here and let me
know whether or not it's been fixed I'm
also looking in the chat to see that it
is lit its lit fam it's lit fam spam
like your asian asian asian cousin or
something fist me daddy still quiet okay
wrong mic perhaps it's the wrong Mike
let me see
Mike yep I'm gonna I'm gonna check that
right now so let's see old you ha ha ha
ha
check Oh No
maybe
Oh check hello can you hear me I believe
that just switched over the mic to the
boom she's right here ah uh-huh
there's the boom does it sound better
now
yo hey whoo all right thank you guys in
chat for letting me know I'm not sure
how that got switched around must have
been from tweaking the settings on
awesome hardware the other week but okay
as I was saying this is the final round
so we've got three contestants three
runner uh three finalists I should say
and they're all I would say the three
best pcs we've ever seen on booted at
least the three most expensive for sure
because they're all custom water-cooled
this is the I should also mention that
this is the custom water-cooled Edition
or season of booted the first and only
first and only one and it's been it's
been really exciting because you just
get to see a lot more creativity with a
custom liquid-cooled build I'm actually
working on one myself just posted my
first build log on the channel if you
haven't seen it um so there's a lot of
work and a lot of thought that goes into
these I mean as much thought as you want
to put into them but it has the
potential to really you have the
potential to make it your own
and so we've been seeing a lot of
personality from the systems on this
particular season so we're gonna check
out three finalists right now starting
with Brad Brad was our week one finalist
and he was rockin inside of the fantex
evolved micro ATX case and for a micro
ITX system he's just really crammed a
lot of stuff in here and done an amazing
job at making it look damn good that is
not a hardware canucks referenced in
case you were wondering but I just I
love the color scheme here I feel like
gray is one of those underrated colors
when it comes to custom liquid cooling
people don't really use gray all that
much or if they do they use it kind of
as a secondary color look kind of like
how I did hot line you see a lot of that
but to use gray as a primary color I
felt was really original here and and it
just it just works beautifully I love
how he did the custom work on the
radiator
those are those are some ek right that's
sorry that's the reservoir
those are XS PC so those are XS PC rads
- 40s I was 240 at the front I guess
there's a 240 at the top - it looks
bigger than a 240 but I guess that case
doesn't support a 280
but yeah so he's got two of those and
he's painted in both gray the cable
sleeping on this thing is let's see if I
can find a better shot where is it wait
where are you look at that's leaving I
think I think Brad takes the cake for
best cable sleeping on booted or at
least in this season I shouldn't say in
the entire series I'm sure there's
someone else you who rivals this but
just cable management on point that
training is just wicked just look at
that side profile I love that I love the
runs in this system - I like how the I
really like the bend going from the GPU
to the the waterblock I think that's
just a really nice curve that fills out
the rest of the system it would have
looked a little empty in that second
quadrant of the rig had he just kind of
gone straight up and in to the CPU from
the video card but I really like how
this looks it looks very pleasing to the
eyes
nothing's too one-sided everything's
well balanced it seems and let's take
another look at this shot here so stock
window right on the stock window on the
on the case on the evolved micro ATX
just looks absolutely beautiful I also
like how he did the watch McCall I love
the choice of fittings I always kind of
got like a black and red vibe going over
there and his water block how we went
with a full nickle ek supremacy Evo I
think it's it's really often that we see
the water block and like the GPU
terminal match like you they're either
both black or they're both nickel-plated
they're both like you know plexi um I
don't know I think I think he took a
gamble to see whether or not it would
look good if he just had that the
waterblock looked completely different
than the other elements and I think it
checks out I think it looks fantastic
and it also matches the SLI bridge that
they've got over there I'm sorry that's
a yeah that's an SLI bridge he's got two
GTX 780 TI's in SLI
I should probably mention that Core i7
4790k
but yeah all together looks very
beautiful beautiful system Brad however
as most of you know by now on the season
finale of every episode of booted we do
something a little bit extra where we
show off the cable management the
underbelly of each finalists system just
to show I don't know just to show their
ugly side if they have an ugly side it's
got to be the cable management side so
we're gonna check out Brad's we're gonna
check out Brad's closet see if he's got
any skeletons in there so here it is
here's here's Brad's cable management
and actually it's it's not terrible so
one thing you have to remember is that
the the Evolve fantex
at the Evolve is an incredibly well
designed case that has tons of a room
for air for cable management and
especially by the power supply because
you've just got tons of room so much
room for activities and his cables look
more or less very tied down they're all
bound very nicely I'd say his his fan
cables going into the fan hub at the
back of a behind the motherboard tray or
a little bit loose they could have been
routed together but it's not a Bismil
side panel still probably going to go on
no problem as SSDs got two of those SSDs
there the Samsungs and he's even got a
little nice drain system at the bottom
there I really like the drain system
that's actually going out the rear of
his chassis can't remember if the entha
we've olve
has a grommet there or routing hole for
frigerator or if that's custom I'm not
sure either way smart choice Brad and
your cable management checks out in my
book so well done on you mate very very
nice system next we've got Ian
ian is also building in a fan text case
however he's gone the full ATX tower
route here with it enthu primo again a
beautiful case fantex does great work in
the in the chassis department is
wrecking the core i7 5820k and two gtx
980ti s in sli and as you can tell
ian has gone with a full blown aperture
labs custom theme and thank you very
much well uh for the donation baby oil
cooled PC I'm gonna said we're gonna
save that for awesome hardware I feel
like Paul would get offended and and
hurt he would be genuinely hurt if I did
anything baby oil related without him so
um that'll have to wait until another
awesome hardware show but appreciate the
donation so okay so we've got an
aperture labs ridiculous portal theme
here I feel like I'm hyping it up too
much but it is a really nice system I
love the colors obviously great choice
you've got orange and blue for the to
represent each of the main characters
that you play as in Portal 2 he's got
the little figurines stand them off to
the right here as well there's those AKG
K 7 X X's that that I'm rocking right
now Illuminati confirmed but I just love
the bends and this as well the runs are
so clean like there's so many bends and
I said this before on the episode that
Ian was featured in a couple weeks ago
but the bend going from his CPU down to
the kind of shroud the power supply
shroud down there the blue one that's
going down I just love how it wraps
around the video cards like he I don't
know it's like he didn't take any
shortcuts you know what I mean like he
didn't have to do it that way but I
don't know especially the the orange one
going from the GPU to the radiator up
top I'm sorry
yeah the GP to the radiator up top if we
look at it here how it kind of just goes
in towards the motherboard and then up
and then it goes back out up to the
radiator up top like he could have just
gone
like diagonally like he didn't have to
make all those crazy bends I just feel
like he did a lot of extra work here
just to make that just to get the look
that he really wanted and I think his
time and patience really paid off here I
love the the back plates the custom back
plates here on the GPUs as well
everything about this system is just so
well thought out he's got the decals on
not only the GPUs but on the motherboard
the little cover over his rear i/o and
even look at the sli bridge even the sli
bridge has a little aperture light up
aperture logo there that's that's so
freakin crazy I just I love it I love
man I love it so much and obviously he's
got two different loops here that's
pretty obvious but in case you're not
too familiar with liquid cooling the
blue and orange are completely separate
loops so he's got one loop for a CPU
that's the blue one and then the orange
ones going just for his GPU so he's got
dedicated cooling loops for each of
those component regions so temps are
pretty pretty chilly I would imagine and
more decals on the on the radiators and
you can see we've got some white LED
accent lighting here rounding out the
case matches beautifully like again
perfect case choice I think for an
aperture themed build like I said it
just looks like it was made in the lab
just the case itself it's got that strip
it's like very sterile looking very like
clean minimalistic it looks like a robot
itself kind of does and I believe this
is a custom window looks like you did
some custom work here with the window I
don't think that comes stuck on the
Primeau so nice nice job on that as well
cable cabling is is a very nice on the
the the GPU your PCI Express cables are
just that perfect bullets them curves
dim curves oh yeah and I think white
LEDs was a great choice I'm glad you
didn't try to spice it up with like an
NZXT hue plus tried to make it all you
know orange and blue flashing lights and
stuff at you did a perfect job with
white in my opinion but we still have to
look at
your cable management Ian to see if
you're hiding anything we should be
concerned about this let's check let's
check that out all right interesting
okay so um you can clearly see he's got
some soft tubing back here obviously
that's just for just true to help things
work around a little bit easier back
there and cable management is
surprisingly good for how much stuff you
have cramming it into the system like
you've taken advantage of all the
tie-down points you're using velcro
straps properly your fan cables are
routed nicely to the hub it's just it
looks kind of messy at first just
because there's so much stuff there's
really just a lot going on but for
everything that you've been working with
I think you managed it pretty well damn
then pumps man
good thing you got those pump mounts
buying that case oh yeah good job Ian
good job you're definitely in the
running for a reason and then last up
we've got oh where are the specs on this
one
this is Patrick's but Patrick does not
have where is your stuff Patrick give me
a sec to bring up Patrick's specs and
stuff so we can see what hardware he's
he's sporting here and beer chage shared
mission what oh there we go okay so this
is Patrick C's uh you know building in
the Corsair graphite 780 great case for
water cooling much room to plan stuff
out I just got a text message for my
wife while I'm streaming I wonder if
this is like a delayed message like
about but I'm up nope she's just she's
replying to my other friends stupid
group texts
I hate group texts anyway we've got the
x99s sli plus motherboard from MSI 16
gigs of Corsair dump lat Stevie our 420
603 way GTX 980 s holy smokes
remember back then when you could do
3-way good times good times
Samsung 950 pro and an 840 Evo didn't
have much specs here on the liquid
cooling except we're rocking a ek
supremacy Evo also a GPU block is from
ek as well take a side profile here now
you've gone with a kind of a distilled
water it's just completely clear and as
many of you guys know who saw last
week's episode he's got an NZXT hue plus
in here so that reflects really well
we'll talk about that a little bit later
as far as the bends go again all the
bends and in these rigs are just super
clean I don't see any kind of like
bubbling or you know artifacts I don't
know if I would call them artifacts but
there's no awkward bends everything
looks really parallel and even and it's
a it's just that's just a fat radiator
at the front I really like that radiator
you've got a 360 at the top as well and
there's a 120 there's a 120 millimeter
radiator at the very bottom of the case
that's kind of recessed into that lower
region it's kind of a lower compartment
down there cable management is super
OnPoint here also just going with a
color neutral theme all around black
white gray and I think I think a white
case was a good choice
about how you've got just like your is
that an SSD in your drive K yeah it
looks like you've got some SSDs and in
the cage I wasn't sure if you were
keeping them behind your motherboard
tray at all but yeah I like just how you
have all your drives just just chilling
right above your your radiator there
that's that's also really nice see if
we've got another shot here beautiful
got using the same water block on my my
current project right now and it's very
pretty happy with my choice yeah it's
just super clean cable routing the
training is on point as well so here's
an LED shot with the hue plus on this is
just pure white
and whites a nice color because it just
shows you the true the true color of
whatever's inside in this case the true
color inside the only real colors like
silver and white and some gray accents
maybe but if you have more colorful
components inside of your system
changing the LED color to something
other than white usually tends to wash
it out
I know if Hotline like I actually like
the way it looks better with white
lighting than pink lighting or fuchsia
lighting whatever you want to call it
because doles the colors whenever
there's you know like a saturated pink
LED in there but it's a matter of
preference um of course Patrick Pia you
know he's a man of variety so every once
in a while when he's feeling crazy he he
puts it on spectrum mode puts that hue
plus on spectrum and just takes his
pants off and dances around and I think
I think this is this is just it has like
that wow factor I would say not many
systems do this even really really nice
ones don't have like the wow factor
where it's almost kind of mesmerizing I
think the the hue plus just does a
really good job here reflecting the
light bouncing off of the the colorless
distilled water alright yeah distilled
fluid just looks really nice I like it I
like it a lot moon oh oh oh I should
have done video submissions well I tried
doing video submissions for booted if
they could like send me a video of their
actual system so we could like maybe see
if they had like some led effects that
would not be well represented in photo
form but that would would have limited
the entries anyway I'm getting off-topic
Patrick excellent build but we still
have to look at your cable management
just to make sure that you're not full
of shit that you actually know how to
build a computer because I'm not
convinced after seeing all this no you
could just be some hack job doesn't even
know how to install a CPU
I don't know I'm saying let's see how
you did on the back alright Wow okay so
um on the right side where you've got
your extensions your sleeve extensions
it looks like you've grouped them all
very nicely and on the left side it
looks just like spaghetti I guess it I
can't tell if there's a method to your
madness here or if it's just madness
because it looks like things are
crossing over especially you know when
you get closer to your drives but over
there you got SATA cables and you know
cables for your fear uh maybe there's a
fan controller on the 780 T or whatever
it is your hue plus there's a lot of
stuff going on over there and I feel
like you could have cleaned it up a
little bit more just because you do have
so much space um behind the motherboard
tray in the 780 t I think you've got
like an inch and a half at least maybe
even more I'm not sure but but yeah I
would say I would say cable management
on the backside not your strongest point
out of the out of the three competitors
here today however I have seen worse and
and your front side turns me on
so on that note those are our three
final finalists ladies and gentlemen and
right about now you should be seeing a
link be blown up in chat by my by
various mods I've got some beautiful
mods that have also been just a huge
help for this show so click that link
and vote vote on which PC you want and
just really quick shout outs to spider
fan Mike the manic geek cell processing
and of course wifey sauce for just being
amazing mods just handling anything I
ever needed for this series it's just
been a no brainer and you guys have
really made it a lot easier on me then
it could have been so I do appreciate
you guys helping out and stuff but yeah
go ahead and vote on who you will think
deserves the ground prize in case you
guys forgot or you didn't know
the grand-prize have booted for every
season I've been giving away a $500 gift
card and it's usually it's in their
choice of a steam gift card or an Amazon
gift card every winter so far of the
seasons have have chosen the Amazon gift
card most likely to soup up their rigs
buy more computer hardware things like
that thank you very much
Feenie for the donation you would shit
on Anne Hathaway's chest I think we all
would except for me because I'm married
and my wife is watching this so um I
forgot what I was saying I'm just
thinking about pooping on in Hathaways
chest now but but yes it's uh it's it's
it's nice to see people win things it's
nice to be able to give them things that
they deserve am I trying to say
it's cool seeing someone earn something
and being really happy about it so yeah
you built a kick-ass system and you beat
out 14 other systems enjoy this prize
and make your system even more awesome
so you can go on entering other PC
contests in the future and beating those
as well um but yeah I don't know I mean
I guess there is always room for
improvement right like a PC I don't know
is a PC ever done or is it just as done
as you want it to be I guess you could
always make iterations to it over over
time right cuz I don't know what like
all the all the PCs that we saw just now
are like borderline perfect in my
opinion a couple tweaks here and there
but you don't need like a $500 gift card
to really improve it that much
diminishing law returns and all that but
it doesn't have to be computer hardware
they might just want to buy a bunch of I
don't know gloves maybe they're really
in desperate need of lots of gloves
Amazon can do that for you um but I've
killed enough time I think just by
rambling nonsense here because I don't
have a sponsor spot had to fill fill the
Philly Philly air a little bit there but
I think right now we should take a look
at our season five winner because 15 pcs
entered this season of booted like they
usually do 12 of them were eliminated
booted if you will by you guys the live
audience and that left three three noble
contenders but uh now we're gonna have
to chop off two more of them because the
end of the day folks you guys know that
there can only be one who is the one
ladies and gentleman is a brad is it Ian
or is it Patrick who will be the very
last and final series winner Wow
oh my goodness this is insane Ian with
look at this freaking three-way
three-way a um this three-way just
battle to the first place this is I
think the closest we've ever seen the
scoreboard in booted for sure
I mean Ian won by about 8% but then
Patrick and and Brad just 1% away from
each other fascinating fascinating and
they weren't even that far behind Ian
holy moly and really I that that's cool
oh you guys can't see anything I'm so
sorry
I am fuck I'm a fuckup even one in wins
Ian wins all the things like I was
saying look at how close this is guys
holy shit
I'm just talking to myself for like the
last five minutes beautiful what a way
to end the series holy smokes
so congratulations Ian you you clearly
deserve it
I think you've won the hearts of many of
the live viewers with your your homage
to the portal franchise and I can see
why you are our season champion for this
series absolutely good stuff and then
and also pat on the backs huge pat on
the backs pat on the grundles to Brad
and Patrick for making it this far and
for just getting inches within the the
victory the gold medal man that was that
was really close that was really good
guys um but shit that's that's it Ian
I'll be contacting you soon via email
look out for my email we'll be in touch
my people call your people actually on
how many people I'll just ill just be me
but um that's it guys this brings a tear
to my eye to to say goodbye but it's not
really goodbye cuz I'll be seeing you in
the next video anyway I've got a lot of
good stuff planned um let me know let me
know if you guys want to see more
reviews of things or more like testing
of things like more experimental stuff
or you see reviews like unboxings and
things like that
because I've got like a video queue of
things that need to get reviewed but
then also like like different
experiments that I want to do with like
the 1060 or the the R X 480 but it's
like do I just do it like a proper
review of that card or do I do something
like off the rails because I know the
vendors gonna be mad like hey where's
that review I'll be like oh sorry I've
been like testing it in doom with Vulcan
and OpenGL for like the last 20 days cuz
that's what I feel like doing but I know
I need to do the review stuff but what
do you guys want to see let me know um
and also I might be doing a Pokemon go
sketch in the next coming who knows how
long but I think that'll be fun
um not going to be a wrap it's just
gonna be a straight-up sketch this time
we'll see it's in the works but that is
going to do it for now guys thank you
all as always for tuning in and being
such awesome awesome fans and viewers
I'm just super super fortunate to have
you guys on my side and and with me all
the time so have a good evening I hope
you all enjoy the rest of your days or
evenings or mornings or what have you
and I'll be seeing you guys very shortly
and yeah peace love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
