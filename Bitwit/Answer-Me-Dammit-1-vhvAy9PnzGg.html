awesomesauce news earlier this week I
asked you all to send in some questions
for a new Q&amp;amp;A segment that I would be
doing called answer me dammit so first
one how is the HTTP see that you built
almost a year ago holding up and he
changes upgrades since then or in the
near future if you guys aren't familiar
I built an HTTP sea about a year ago and
it was mainly just for the living room
here at my place I've got two roommates
that I live with and we weren't really
interested in getting cable so I opted
for an HTTP sea solution and so far it's
been working out really great I haven't
really done a thing to it since then but
I do have some plans in the future maybe
to upgrade the GPU it's currently got a
650 Ti in there I'm sorry 650 Ti boost
so not too bad at all but I might
upgrade it to something a little bit
more current maybe something like a 760
or maybe even wait for a mid tier
Maxwell GPU in the future so I can do a
little bit more gaming on it later on if
I got a 256 gig vertex for and I wanted
to rate it at raid zero with a Samsung
840 256 gigabyte could I raid them at
all in raid zero the answer is yes you
can theoretically do it you can raid any
two drives the issue there is that your
read/write performance is actually
limited by your slowest drive so if you
have one drive that supports read writes
up to 500 megabytes per second and
another one that supports read writes up
to 400 megabytes per second your
theoretical throughput would be
something closer to 800 as opposed to a
thousand megabytes per second just
because you're limited by the slowest
drive so bear that in mind also I've
heard some heard some rumors online and
I'm not sure if this is true or not
because I haven't really tested it
myself to confirm or deny either way but
I've heard that if your two SSDs don't
have the same controller you might run
into some issues because of the internal
algorithms when when trimming for
example that also might cause some
instability as well so my suggestion to
you would be to either use them
completely separately and don't raid
them or sell both of them and get one
heart one SSD your throughput won't be
as much but at the same time you only
have one drive and it reduces your risk
of losing all your data because
obviously in raid 0 if one drive dies
they're both dead so do a little bit
more research yourself and make the best
decision that works for you what did you
want to do earlier in your life when I
was younger my grandpa used to make toys
officially he worked for like companies
like Tommy and Mattel he would come home
sometimes and have toys that he had
actually
signed and me and me being a young kid
thought it was amazing and I started to
get creative and started to make my own
toys so I would just walk walk around
the house just collect random things and
tape them together and MacGyver like
random toys and I would show them like
look do you think do you think someone
will mass-produce this Cup strapped to a
spoon with a ball on it it was kind of
an obsession of mine as a kid always
like oh yeah I want to be a toymaker
when I grew up like my grandpa as I got
older I realized that in order to do
that you kind of had to go to school and
particularly be good at math and I don't
even math so I can't be an engineer and
I was like yeah I don't think that's
gonna happen also by the time you're
like 1516 the idea of making toys
doesn't really appeal to you like it did
when you were seven so I guess there's
that how can I join a company like
Newegg NCIX or other retailer I love
technology and want to have a job where
I have fun doing it also I'm a first
year undergrad what classes should I
take this is kind of a tricky one
because everybody on my team at Newegg
right now has found their way into that
company a completely different way so
there's no one formula or strategy my
suggestion would be to work on your
craft whatever trades that you like work
for free do internships if you can as
far as what classes you should take I
mean only you can can know that whatever
appeals to you the most what I would
advise is make a lot of connections talk
to people in your classes that seem
interesting or that seem knowledgeable
and make connections because honestly
networking is a huge benefit one of the
biggest benefits I think of going to
college in the first place is meeting
all the people that will someday be
working at these awesome companies that
you want a job at and so you know
whatever if you helped a guy on a
project and you know you had a beer with
him what one day after class maybe five
years down the line he'll remember you
when he's got a job at Google and you're
looking for work
there's overclocking your CPU or GPU
void your warranty is there a hardware
switch that's tripped when you do
overclock your hardware in other words
will the manufacturer know that you
overclocked when you return it as far as
I know overclocking does not void your
warranty and there is no way for a
manufacturer to tell if you've overclock
the CPU or GPU the only way that they
would be able to tell is if you tried it
and they obviously saw some burn marks
then clearly you've been tampering with
it and probably abusing it more than you
should be and in that case I think your
warranty would be void other than that
as long as you're overclocking within
safe and reasonable parameters and
you're not you know putting in one point
seven volts for your unlocked ksq
Haswell processor I think you're gonna
be alright alright guys now we're gonna
switch gears a little bit here
and we're gonna do a flash round of
questions I'm gonna have Aaron in the
back ask me some questions I'm just
gonna say the first thing that comes to
my mind you guys ready 3 2 1 go which
program do you use to edit your videos
Adobe Premiere Pro cs6 if you could ask
killer any question what would it be why
you no paint good if I said I love you
would you say it back Oh Aaron what's so
sweet of you
no seriously this is a question I know I
know that's just I wasn't ready for it
you know can we can we maybe talk about
this after the shoot oh my god
I'm wondering what major you enrolled in
school to get the job you have now
multimedia production management do you
like burritos mate do I what's your
ethnicity half white half Thai are you
ever going to make t-shirts for your
channel that we can buy yes but first I
would like to know would you buy one
alright ladies and gentlemen that is
gonna wrap it up for this first ever
episode of answer me dammit thank you
all so much for watching I'm Cal with
awesome saws news please feel free to
leave your thoughts and comments about
this first episode down below let me
know what changes or improvements you'd
like to see on future episodes thank
y'all for watching and until next time
I'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
