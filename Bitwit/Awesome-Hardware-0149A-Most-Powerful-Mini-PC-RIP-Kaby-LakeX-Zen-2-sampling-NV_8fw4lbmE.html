thanks guys for buying stuff in our
store and if you buy stuff during the
show you'll shout your name out at the
end of the stage
yes tradition it's very steeped in the
steeped in mystery and we've been doing
it for centuries and great pomp and
circumstance that's yep okay so I know
that's out of the way we can dive into
our first segment of the day which is to
fund or not to fund oh no I forgot to
set up the Lord that I'll get on top of
that hold on is the question you're
talking Kyla I'm going to fix this
so to fund or not to fund is when we
take a look at some crowd funded
campaigns and decide whether or not they
are worth our hard-earned dollars you
got to be pretty picky with the
Kickstarter and IndieGoGo campaigns
these days just because sometimes they
don't work out and all the promises they
promise you are actually false and you
never get the product that you were you
were promised and it could be very risky
investing money into some product that
doesn't really exist yet it's always
risky business so we're gonna hopefully
let's talk about products and people can
invest in yes definitely throw money at
all of these notes with little I'm
having a difficult time talking why
don't you continue cal all right so our
first item here is the mini PC which is
the world's most powerful pocket-sized
PC look at this guy the video for some
reason on this site wasn't working when
I looked at it earlier today so I
actually haven't watched the video here
well we're watching it now it was his
first time for me right here but that's
the PC that he had you know clearly he
oh he's a work he's a gym rat nerd and
he does computing by day gym perusing by
night iron pumping by evening and tech
fondling by early morning if I don't you
really captured this guy yeah I know I'm
in and out just from the first five
seconds of this video and let's talk
about this what makes it popular well
first off it's already met 100 thousand
dollars of its twenty thousand dollar
goal that's that's good and it's 5 inch
5 inch screen 1280 by 720
don't don't be upset that it's not 1920
by 1080 it's only 5 inches that's
actually a pretty decent resolution for
a small screen I mean granted we have
phones now they're 2560 by 1440 like
four and a half inches so I guess
there is an argument there if it fits in
a Chanel purse if it's a national purse
which is what we've always wanted in our
piece our mini pcs is is it Chanel
compatible or one of those stupid like
single strap the little man purse Man
Man bags immerse the it's not European
it's lame yeah for lack of a better term
I just I keep thinking it looks like
this guy's holding a look I I can't
imagine that there is a screen on the
other side shy had this for my mini tiny
battlestation video oh yeah because this
this this has the screen already
attached built into the PC this is like
the thumbnail for that right that is
they just copied me yeah
like what the so I okay so maybe
I'll actually pick one of these up if it
ever comes to market all right so we've
got a 2.5 6 gigahertz Intel Atom x7
processor ok doesn't say it's probably
just you know I don't know if it's a
single core dual core it doesn't really
say 8 gigs of ram not bad
128 gig SSD with the option to increase
that USB see it's got Ethernet dual band
Wi-Fi bluetooth 4.2 a full size HDMI out
I do like I do appreciate a full size
HDMI port on these smaller devices
that's capable of 4k at 60 so it's
probably hdmi 2.0 I would think built-in
card reader 6 hours battery life so we
can run on battery that's also
interesting but it can run on battery
for 6 hours depending on use the atom
x7z 8750 is a quad core ok quarter cores
four threads with the base frequency of
1.6 and a burst of 2.5 gigahertz I mean
it would have to be at least a quad core
to be advertised as the fastest mini PC
ever well the most powerful pocket sized
pieces watch more of this video how much
do you think this thing goes for fall
without it's going to LSU I already
looked at it I even launched a special
only hundred in $29 729 which i think is
pretty reasonable right I mean I mean
yeah that's for for I mean yeah sure
what I'm
what I'm thinking here is that 120 $29
for like a fully integrated PC like you
could it has HDMI out you could connect
it to a monitor and hook up a keyboard
and mouse and just have like use it as a
desktop yeah right like this fun little
folding mini keyboard they have this
crappy fold-out keyboard which is like I
think almost exactly like the one that I
used in my video if not the exact one
but you could attach like you know
whatever a mechanical keyboard to it you
know the most tricked-out gaming mouse
and and badass ultrawide monitor eight
gigs of ram for the person and chat who
asked no grand you see I think what you
gotta sell people on with this it's like
how is it how is it gonna be that
significantly different from like in an
expensive tablet or they're just like
your cell phone yes I mean it's a
slightly larger screen than a cell phone
so you have to point out you have to
point out specific scenarios where you
need the extra features like if being a
Windows system versus versus Android my
or is like I mean full-sized HDMI out is
nice and that kind of thing yeah it's
it's - it's not it's not pocket-sized I
mean it's it's kind of pocket-sized it's
purse-sized but it's Chanel sized it's
not something that I would carry in my
front or back pocket
no not on you like it's large for that
so yeah I mean a hundred twenty-nine
bucks so that's pretty inexpensive so
I'd be curious to see just to run this
thing through the ringer and see how it
performs but there it is you guys let us
know what you think and we'll we'll
probably not read any of any of your
comments in chat all right max is that
HD mask the HD mask is a discreet USB
surveillance camera which is is actually
a marketplace item so you can buy it now
did you mean discreet what is this a is
this a brand is this a name a brand name
or is this a misspell in the headline
discrete discrete meaning it is spelled
is CR ete that's that's when oh wait
what is this careful and circumspect and
once speech your accent hey what yeah
discreet with two E's is different than
1e oh wow you know what yeah color me
yeah you should pretty good with words
but alright never mind
yeah let's continue let's never bring
this up again discrete like it's one Wow
yeah for some reason I feel like I
should yeah all right let's every dog
has his day
Wow why I'm actually really surprised
III am too so wait I feel like you know
now you're second-guessing me to make
sure that I have it right like 1a means
like separate or apart and two E's means
like low profile like sort of you know
you're discretely pocketing a flask
that's different than a discreet
graphics card which is a separate
singular kind of you know yes I mean
matched now that it's been described to
me I feel like I have seen that before
mm-hmm and this is like maybe even a
realization that I've come to before
right yeah but but not one that you've
liked but didn't stick yeah right so
yeah there you go
anyway alright so it will this time yeah
so it's a 1080p sensor and it's got
Wi-Fi streaming so you can actually
monitor this from from your phone and it
has motion detection so basically you
plug it in it's just looks like a
regular USB charger I believe it can
also charge your phone with that USB
port it'd be stupid if it couldn't and
it has a built-in camera so it's it's a
security camera in a very small easy to
use form factor you just plug it into
the wall and you sync it up to your
phone and you can monitor it and oh
oh but it's pretty I think the the the
weird thing here is that like wouldn't
you have to have like an AC outlet or
yeah an AC port that is in the proper
location for surveilling right if it's
like super low behind the couch then it
doesn't do much good
yeah you'd have to maybe route like an
extension cord or something and at that
point it loses the convenience factor
and it's discrete factor discreet ee
factor so I don't know like $99 seems
like a lot for one of these if it was
like a pack of two or three then I then
that's the yeah it looks so you can't
Cherica two then and then I would say
sure but $99 for one seems kind of steep
especially if you had an articulating if
the camera could articulate which it
doesn't look like it can it's just yeah
you need to be a remotely access it to
like yeah angle it at what you want to
look at or whatever
oh so you can't angle it no you can't
I'm agreeing with you yes yeah feature
yeah exactly so um I don't know I would
pass on this one I'm more interested in
the pocket-sized PC but let's take a
look at our last talking PC for 129
which is such a bargain right it's like
okay this is one camera it's one webcam
for a hundred dollars it's only twenty
thirty dollars cheaper than an entire PC
just doesn't add up telling you all
right let's move on to our last item
here for next that fund maybe this one
can trump the last two items we just
took a look at this is the mobius
immersive cinematic 3d audio Edie phone
okay
okay from our day's odd uh DS DS these
nuts okay that's what they were thinking
when they probably make the name so okay
these are located in Santa Ana so
they're probably familiar with that term
that's probably true so this is
basically a super high-end headphone
million dollars funded already a million
dollars funded out of its fifty thousand
dollar goal which is immense I need it I
need just a minute
oh yeah take care of take care of your
doggie but I guess the whole stick here
is that it's got 3d emulation full 3d
emulation with support for surround
sound modes and they have this
technology the planar magnetic driver
technology that basically integrates 3d
sounds in a way that you haven't heard
before
according to them it's actually kind of
it sounds very gimmicky and just kind of
like a you know you kind of brush it off
till you see like all of the quotes all
of the testimonials from from from
brands like you know publishers like
diverge and stuff who have checked out
prototypes saying that the sound stage
is immensely wide and the positioning
for for objects in the scene whatever
you're listening to gaming for example
are very precise which is even even more
impressive than than the sound stage and
and it's just supposed to be like the VR
equivalent for your ears like what VR
was for your eyes where you could just
like look around like this headphone or
these headphones are supposed to be that
immersive anymore like 360 degree
environment so it sounds like the the
ads for the sound bars that you put like
in your home theater and like you don't
need out 5.1 or 7.1 speaker setups
totally cuz these speakers
project and make you think that it's
very loud yeah I find that harder to
believe than a pair of headphones
because it leaves the headphones are
around both of your ears whereas the
sound bars just like you know coming
from one direction and stuff yeah and it
also has head tracking so if you did
have a triple monitor display where
you're actually moving your head lip
looked and right it will calculate and
do math to make the sound project from
where relative to where your head is
okay well not only mean that's that
sounds fancy but it's kind of cool I
think that's pretty cool the fact that
your and it makes sense if your head
turns even a little bit the sound stage
or the pinpoint areas of where sound
sources are coming from should also
change reflect that head turn oh okay
yeah alright I was gonna say don't the
speakers move with your head so that
wouldn't matter but I guess it's trying
to shame it's trying to change the sound
as you would hear it as your head is
moving right in a simulation of a 3d
environment exactly okay yes yes that is
exactly right it is a headset not
headphones I keep calling your headset
or headphone
but it does have a detachable boom mic
that's included okay so you can use it
for gaming and stuff boy wired and
bluetooth connectivity so you can use it
with a cable USB cable or connect
wirelessly and it's two hundred and
sixty-nine dollars - fun with the early
bird special which is not completely out
of reach and insane for something that's
supposed to be innovative still 115 left
I kind of like this the fact that
they're doing something a little bit new
or different with headphones instead of
just trying to make them look cooler or
add more RGB this actually seems like
maybe it could push that market forward
a little bit with this new feature with
whatever technology they're messing with
if it is as good as it is hyped up to be
so I don't know out of all of these I
think that seems like the most the one
that I would use most
I think the mini PC is the coolest but
also the one that I wouldn't use at all
because it's just I don't know I don't
really have a need for a PC that tiny
that can't game nonetheless so I would
go to the Mobius second with the mini PC
and then probably the USB surveillance
cameras last I've been arrested to try
the Mobius out just to just compare it
to you know a 5.1 headset or write that
kind of thing yeah exactly can you will
you be able to tell the difference like
you know a blind a blind ear test
between 7.1 and and this 3d that'd
be interesting to find out but thus
concludes to fund or not to fund people
um I guess we can move on to ask the
audience they've done this segment in a
few weeks this is where Paul and I ask
you guys a series of three questions you
guys answer as honestly as you can
another thought to ask for the Internet
these days and then Paul and I have to
guess the reason why you have to answer
honestly is because Paul and I will be
guessing honestly honestly thinking and
guessing what your answers will be it's
a sort of a quiz for you significant
repercussions but more of a quiz for us
to decide to determine how well we know
you guys so it will be sort of a battle
between me and Paul here and then the
loser for every answer you get wrong or
lose to the other person you have to
take a drink that's that's just the
normal standard painful
I know hey I know I tried to get
really just avid ad this one
so the first off first off of our first
question is very simple very
straightforward but also super
controversial Pub G or fortnight up do
your fortnight go this this will this
will really separate the pub G players
from the fortnight players
well said Paul literally and exactly
what this is going to do this will
really provide us I have a feeling this
will really provide us direct feedback
from people who reply to the the poll
this may be a polarizing poll could be
this could be very polarizing could be
unless everyone likes just one case
that's what we do here oh god he farted
again
oh jeez Sam here oh here's really no
it's it's very like sulfuric it's it's
social fear wasn't even a mist that was
like don't get them excited he'll fart
more it's hard it's difficult to spray
that stuff with that and trying that
tastes like computer screens that kind
of thing all right so let's let's let's
ask our second question should wait is
that we usually do it we asked her so
yeah we usually drop that second line in
there just so you guys have tired to
answer that Cup second question is how
many pcs have you ever built we're
asking you guys how many pcs in your
lifetime from since you were born till
now have you built full-blown pcs from
the ground up not like amazing the
graphics card yourself very specific yes
I wanted to give a wide range of options
and make it more tricky for us so if
you've never built a PC but you've taken
one apart it's negative one yep yep yeah
I've you've only disassembled remember
or otherwise destroy one up sure we'll
leave that one open to interpretation
all right Paul up to your fortnight I
mean both of these games pub G was sort
of like the number one game at the time
it was the first huge viral game in
recent memory and then for tonight kind
of came in out of nowhere and stole the
show to some degree but pub G's still
vastly popular and so there's kind of
like anytime I do a fortnight or pub G
related video there's always like a
debate and chat or in the comments of
which one's better so and I feel like
it's pretty even on both sides but what
do you think in terms of percentage what
percentage of the vote do you think this
this gets so we're just betting at what
percentage hey let's play yeah you so
your answer would be like 6040 favoring
pub G or from my understanding based on
steam statistics fortnight is more
popular wait so you've already looked at
the steam statistics recently oh you
don't even play fortnight on steam but
this based on articles I've read and
stuff as far as consecutive players and
that get I think fortnight is more
popular overall but I think with our
audience actually pub G's gonna win okay
so I'm gonna say like 54 pub g22 wait we
have to save percentages for both Oh
just one just one yeah all right Lovejoy
54% 54% I'm gonna say it's more than
that I want to say it's closer to six G
no no two will do 60 to 66 30% in favor
of pub G and I said 54% 54 and we're
good at means we look now it's time to
look yep okay see it click the results
thing now a third option I could throw
things off but just waiting for the it's
a get right to my exact know you don't
know no stop it
oh wow you were what well apparently
your wild card
little hole 200 people to open when your
consider is what why is that I mean this
is a too legit a response this is
because there's lots of people like I
don't care about either of these games
whatever all right well I guess I win
because I was closer what what I said 54
you said sir you have to drink beer ha
ha I wonder what it would be relatively
though if 26 versus 20 if you erase the
first option with 26 would pubsey still
be closer to 54 then 62 what if there
was only 46% only there was some form of
math that could be used yeah I don't
know what that is I can't I can't math
right now I'm live streams because I
can't math in real life we'd have to
assume that Pepsi and fortnight were the
only response is so that's a total of 46
so open what opener bottle open or not
okay do your math Paul total is 46 to
take a big sip of beer that I'll
definitely regret is 26 of that 40 so
it'll be horrible Thanks better hurry
Paul I won't enjoy this at all is 56%
okay so you still win I still win good
job yay 56.5% we could have just looked
at chat 10 minutes that's saying 57% if
you round up from 56.5% all right sweet
yeah I should really look at chat more
for simple questions like that there
double done quick con I'm really not
that good at statistics so I probably
didn't do that math exactly right but
I'm pretty sure that's that's pretty
close and many people in chatter
agreeing with me yeah 56.5
all right let's let's ask our third
question then we'll go back to answering
the second so our third question that we
have for you guys today is what what
kind of mouse are you using are you
using a wired or wireless mouse
specifically Paul and I are able to try
to determine what percentage of users
who are watching the show right now you
guys are using wireless mice so answer
honestly there's wired Wireless and your
mouth your primary Mouse is sentient and
probably has a funny name now that we
know how much you guys enjoy voting for
the for the silly answer we will keep
that in mind for these for these next
ones also vote for turnip residuals
exactly so all right going back to our
second question here how many pcs have
you ever built we have quite a few
options here you at first last time call
so I'm gonna go first this time I think
most of the viewers who are watching us
right now
I probably built I would say I'm gonna
say I'm gonna say 2 2 pcs - yes - that
is my that's my answer
35 that was good that was gonna be that
was the one I was deciding between the
other one I was deciding between so you
say three or five I say - yeah Paul has
more confidence in your your guys's
building experience than I do ever so
slightly so let's let's see it let's see
who's right haha Danika - coming in
fourth now more people have built one pc
and 6 to 10 pcs and they've built - yeah
- later very unpopular it's just not a
number you see you sit on you know I
guess you build your one and you're ok
you're ok with it you got a working
computer that's your ones up here then
you go up to you know and then once you
build another one it's like you're not
just gonna stop that change like tattoos
it's kind of like a tattoo yeah you have
one tattoos or you're like the lizard
that has tattoos from head to toe
exactly on your face and stuff okay then
I get to take another sip just
destroying you at this game gosh darn it
you're so good at knowing their audience
Paul because I love you guys so so much
just cuz I know nothing about them
doesn't mean I know them on that
intimate level
here's making intimate sounds done there
yeah with intimate sounds yeah he's
really into just look at him I wish
there was a dog all right and finally I
marry mess we have to guess I was gonna
say it's funny cuz right now you're
using a wireless mouse so you're using a
wireless mathers one in the thumbnail of
this video that's true it's in my mouth
to conspiracy I mean being a cat all
right I'm gonna say wired well no the
question we have to debate is how what
percentage of users are using wireless
mice okay
Oh what percentage of users are using
wireless correct so now a suit 18 you're
factoring in the third one - yeah yeah
I'm saying 18 18 18 percent okay I'm
gonna say 12 percent percent I thought
there if I didn't want a tip and like
you're if you're still debating but when
I said 18 I thought if anything that's
high but all right here we go
survey says Wow three what know what
what and then no one no one picked the
third one see here you're just if it
wasn't it didn't it didn't have quite
the same draw I probably did not is your
third option probably do not for the
other but all right well tell me percent
all right wait again all right well it's
a clean sweep that is a perfect score
that is the maybe the first perfect
score you've seen on this segment yeah
congratulations Paul Wow
cheers Cheers I drink to clearly trying
to take advantage
I love getting punished I feel like
since I swept you there like there
should be some additional punishment no
actually maybe yeah in the future I'll
think of something like that well we'll
have you have to wear this means that
you have to drape yourself with this
rainbow ribbon there you go
I mean in the meantime I'll do it just
because I like what Kyle is large ribbon
is this from the Corsair bomb and this
from the Corsair box it was so pretty I
just I thought it was pretty too yeah so
I saved it I'll wear it all right
not about your PC's intimacy magazines
you guys have submitted some pictures
and spec lists of your rigs Paul and I
will yeah we all critique them judge you
as I mentioned in my tweet so yeah
everyone hope your hope you have Tufts
thick skin we're gonna be really brutal
with you guys be Raymond Raymond yeah
Raymond you driving at home learning
with Steven with a risin 5 1600 X and 8
gigs of g.skill ripjaws ddr4 cooler
master hyper 212 msi be 350 pc mate and
it looks like a GTX 1063 gig Mini from
gigabyte with yeah ok cool
interesting configuration here are those
fans at the front sets to exhaust yes
you have zero intake fans in this case
the fans are sent to exhaust you have
pure pure negative pressure 100%
negative pressure which is fine if it's
fine
but no you really should flip these fans
I would flip them the mesh if I has mesh
at the front with with something that
doesn't filter their altar and that's
what that's made for so definitely
you're gonna want to flip those fans
yeah
beyond that I might recommend rotating
your cooler as well I don't think you
would have a clearance issue
and I think based on the mounting
hardware with diaper 2:12 you can rotate
it 90 degrees that would just give you
more direct airflow if your fans in the
front are in taking and then you've got
your air also flowing from right to left
with your air cooler I think that would
put you in a little bit better situation
it's probably not terrible right now
because you're going up so yeah but I
would you know I would do that beyond
that your cable management is looking
pretty pretty tidy you've got a little 2
pin from the 6 + 2 pin connector hanging
off there I might see if I could tuck
that away back behind you might be able
to do that we're circumcised you could
snip it off but I I wouldn't I wouldn't
do that and I would keep it in case you
update your graphics card and need an 8
pin in the future this is an interesting
I like the Josh is happy that there you
got the get the fractal front of
placement fractal logo others yeah and
yeah I mean clean build well put
together just a yeah flip those fans
yeah thanks Steven thank you Steve
Patrick Patrick patrique core i7 5820k
4.2 gigahertz stark rock pro 3 from be
quite an AZ rock x99 extreme for looks
like these guts Corsair lpx memory and
NVIDIA GTX 1080 and a DIY PC something
PS I get loads of compliments from your
CPU cooler trick damn right you do it's
 great shirt red shirt duh
I love the DIY piece something series of
cases it is that's really they're really
well built well put together are you
being serious
no okay III know DIY PC makes a range of
products unfortunately I was introduced
to the DIY PC on bad terms
oh and right yeah there s bed 10 test
bench right now they were they were
there like there this was in the first
Bitcoin craze and they tried to make
Bitcoin they try to make Bitcoin mining
cases that were just like cut pieces of
plexi right that you put together and
there and and it just though it was good
products at all I'm sure they make some
some products that might be decent now
and this is like a perfectly functional
case but anyway
yeah I just that's funny that it's a DIY
PC something alright back to the actual
build up this is a single picture you
got a single picture here so zoom in
hits I've got some blue and green kind
of fighting with each other because you
got blue and your motherboard heatsinks
but green elsewhere like in the LEDs or
your power supply a graphics card your
fans so there's not terribly much you
can do about that unless all those LEDs
are RGB which I know the graphics card
is not so you'd at least be stuck with a
green card and everything else blue but
cabling cable management looks ok you're
kind of suffering from that there's a
six plus two extension coming off your
graveyard
plus there's red extent red caps on
those and that don't match it all um
plus there's a red save the cable that
doesn't look all that great so I would
get a black SATA cable get some custom
sleeved cables
maybe green green them black or if you
really wanted to run with it green black
and blue I mean I don't know how great
that would look but at least you
admitted everything else in your system
I'm gonna I want to provide a counter
opinion here No and that means wrong we
got sort of a green light overall and
then there's like a little bit of blue
and then actually it's just some some
way from Red Room some light red accents
here is being a little needy today he's
super needy his thank you he's he's a
sweet boy bully don't kill me
actually with a little bit of red and a
little bit of blue in the green I don't
think that's terrible because like even
got RGB on
on the power supply down here and the
sticker and it almost it almost kind of
matches with me the the cabling being a
little loose I think is what's standing
out to me is that looking quite tidy
there's some excess cables down here
going for the front panel connectors
power supply cables gum coming off here
can be tied up tight here and then of
course that's six pin six plus two
plated hanging off there just yeah not
looking that great so tidy up the cables
and how suggestions you'd have to spend
money on mine you wouldn't so make your
choice be a baller spend all the money
okay
no next up is sugar cube sugar cube a
sugar cube with a r5 1600 MSI tomahawk
gaming be 350 be 350 plus be quiet
silent loop 240 millimeter AO
Ripjaws ddr4 3200 GPU recently broke but
anyways r9 270x and stuff so this looks
like be quiet case as well and get some
some MLP paraphernalia going on MLP for
the win-lose that it's a Shutterfly and
I forget the red ones name I'm blanking
I'm totally a new MLP our brony
reputation has been tarnished sure you
guys will forgive oh yeah alright so
orange accents in this case the great
thing about these cases is that they
already have like if you're going for an
orange theme to build the dam get this
be quiet case Mashable words but it also
limits you in the fact that if you have
any other colors in here it's gonna
clash for example your your cables
leaving with the red and black not sure
if you already had those and just look
better than your stock power supply
cables or what but orange didn't read
the way you have it here isn't really
doing much for me having some orange and
black cables might look a bit more
befitting I like the use of negative
space in your photos though
negative space yeah yeah like empty yep
space there and there and yeah oh wow
heroes right there
yeah he's putting on that like there's
something large in Harry he's more
comfortable resting up against my legs
so that's fine with me right now no
worries look at all the extra room going
on with the extensions back in here yeah
you've got a ton of zip ties which is
great you know you've got some couple
SSDs back there which looks all good I
would just say maybe maybe consider
getting some orange orange and black
sleeved extensions and everything else
looks great
I don't really see much else I feel like
you know if it's if you just had
different colored sleeping then it'd be
perfect I will say the impact of the
extensions apart from not matching with
the orange of the case it's it's
detracted from me by the fact that
there's there's not a power supply shot
down here covering up to the other end
of the cables plugging into the power
supply especially for some reason
there's this one green plug on there
those wishes just slightly odd doesn't
remember a green plug you know yeah
thank you like that on a be quiet I've
even worked with the pure power series
that number green at all maybe you used
it borrowed it from a different power
supply which is kind of risky and well I
mean they just needed if they just
removed the cap and replaced it that
wouldn't be a huge deal but anyway
that's that's very interesting
oh all right pretty clean moving on
moving on to our last fill No
second-to-last fill listed NZXT th400 a
micro ATX build with the Z on the X 3450
overclock the 3.6 gigahertz you can't
overclock as en o you can cuz it's an
aged 55 Z on back when you can do that
eight gigs of course Sarah Ram you can't
overclock the ends in certain ways but I
haven't I haven't done much of it so
yeah gigabyte Radeon HD 7970 gigahertz
edition cooler master hyper 212 X C
Sonic X 560 power supply HyperX savage
240 gig SSD Samsung one terabyte
hard drive yes MCI whatever Hydra and
three Corsair SP 120 RGB he is also
located in Germany cool
alright um only that GPU sag that's the
first thing I thought yeah that stands
out there's no worse that I've seen them
this is our only picture so there's not
gonna be a whole lot to say here I will
alright so I want to I want to start
with the positive and cabling is
incredibly clean yeah and I will say
that the the hyper 212 can look good or
can look cheap in different scenarios
for some reason the purple may be
catching on the on the copper yeah
that's looking pretty clean looking
pretty good there right it's a color
matched so yeah you like cable
extensions and a prop for your for your
graphics card to get rid of that sag and
make it 100 and you've got you've got
like a showcase ready PC yeah everything
else is really clean LED light is LED
strip is showing right here but I do not
believe that would be showing with the
side panel on so that should be fine as
well yeah and you've got you've got a
HyperX savage SSD why aren't you using
here your SSD caddy there oh yeah
maybe it doesn't the savages red is red
and black so maybe it's a match as much
that's true but it's prepayment yeah I
mean maybe put a put a skin on it or
something and showcase it there just to
finish it off yeah those are our
suggestions really good work with it
with the build does really clean thanks
Bill
and then finally we have Tom mr. Tom Tom
Beasley these are the specs i-5 7600 3.5
gigahertz and asus strix h2 7 TF gaming
ATX motherboard 8 gigs of course er lpx
2400 speed and a gtx 1060 from asus
inside of corsair spec alpha case by the
way i'm australian so things are
expensive Ilya and our sympathies to you
ok
so I like the choice of graphics card
for the case I think it
she's really well I also like that the
you know the fact that you got like a
power supply that has red LEDs on it
matches the front LED fans of the case
what isn't doing much here is are the
stock cable supply power supply cables I
feel like getting a higher end power
supply that already has good cables or
just getting some sleeved extensions
would be best you also have a situation
here where I so I'm pretty sure you've
got the fan on the power supply facing
up because of the red LED on it yeah
which I understand but I would suggest
flipping it just because that red LED
would still give you some effect that
week it would cast a red LED down on the
table underneath which is a cool look
and because it's not modular all the
cables are coming out on the side that's
closest to the side panel that's removed
right flipping that will put those
cables closer to where you can tuck them
back behind the motherboard tray and
would also give you you've got plenty
already but like the way you've routed
your your supplemental CPU power up here
the the 8 pin I believe that's an 8 pin
on this motherboard
oh yeah that's a big no-no you got to go
behind them on the board can you I'm but
can I'm pretty sure this is a corsair
case and i have not worked with it
directly but i can't imagine them there
is not a pass-through up on top they
think there is yeah this is this is this
case yeah there is one so so definitely
definitely do that and maybe your and
that's another reason to flip the power
supply because maybe you have it this
way because it wouldn't reach behind the
motherboard tray but it looks like
there's enough length on it you can see
it looping right there and twisting and
going all the way up but yeah you would
have you would have even more
oh yeah anyway with it if you flip that
very I'm headed backwards but beyond
that I would also say you've got since
you've got the white this other side
panel the opposite side panel any cables
that you have that aren't tied back
behind the motherboard tray definitely
stand out a lot against that mm-hmm so
try to group up the cables coming off
your power supply there twist tie the
air get a zip tie and air couple zip
ties and get those all together in a
bunch right and then take anything else
and just tie it down behind the
tre yes so that you can't see them just
do though all those holes yes you've got
ungrounded holes it's a it's a it's a
slightly elastic it's a less expensive
case so it's decent to build in but you
don't know the grommets and everything
you doing things I'll feel free to use
electrical tape for that if you really
want to like guide guide the cables
where they need to be or duct tape even
I've even used duct tape in extreme
measures just to make sure that all
those little cables aren't showing
against against that side panel
additionally I would say swap out your
stock cooler because it's noisy and not
very effective what I want to I want to
point out since you've recommended
electrical tape and duct tape I've used
that too but there is a flip side to it
which is when you go back to it six
months or a year later resin it's been
warmed and the tapes kind of slipped and
left residue and stuff there so there
there is there is there's a flip side to
that painters tape residue payors tape
doesn't leave residue even when it's
heated up and stuff it's pretty good so
maybe look into that is it zip ties
twist ties I I or actually the little
clamps that have adhesive on them so you
could just stick them anywhere behind
your motherboard tray those are really
nice good because you might not have
especially in a budget case a bunch of
tie-down points where you can use two
zip ties or twist ties you can buy a
pack of those for pretty cheap yeah so
definitely look into that get a new
stock I get a new cooler the stock
cooler from Intel sucks it's ugly it's
noisy and you have an i5 7500 like that
warrants a better cooler than a stock
cooler for sure it was like a low-end i3
that maybe but and your RAM is the wrong
wrong slots unless that's where the
motherboard manual says to put them but
I would imagine that too and for that
you want not three and four so put them
in two and four usually usually it's
every other slot or for the RAM spacing
in order to make sure you've got total
channel going right but that's it thank
you very much tom for the submission and
that will conclude get my PC if we
didn't catch you this time then maybe
we'll
next week let's move on though to our
news segment we'll go through these
quickly because wow it's already been
Wow we're at 36 20 rule for these quick
time flies
let's first talk about Intel kickin KB
Lake X to the curb it is now end-of-life
this is an article from PC perspective
from a boy Ryan Shrout sup Shrout are
crazy seen you in a minute for the haze
so keep it like X just to recap was 14
nanometer from Intel LGA 2066 socket it
launched alongside skylake X which was
well mostly kind of well received but KB
like X was definitely not it was poorly
received by the community and the
enthusiasts at large for requiring users
to pay high-end desktop prices for a new
motherboard platform at the time for a
four core or four already processor or a
fork or a thread processor that had
which provided negligible mainstream
features for a high-end desktop price
yet the you know they were good at
overclocking but like the if you
compared it to like a 7700 K barely like
why mark why not worth the extra like in
they had they shipped with slightly
higher clock speed maybe a hundred
megahertz or so they had few lanes
drastically fewer PCIe lanes than the
actual high-end desktop processors like
skylake X so it didn't make much sense
to any of us any of us who are noobs any
of us who are enthusiasts we were all
just kind of scratching our heads when
Intel came to launch with these and I
think they took the hint I think and I
think them making these chips these two
chips the 77 the i7 7740 X which is a
fork or a thread part and the i-5 76 for
TX the four core for thread part are now
end-of-life as officially listed by
Intel on their website and I think they
finally got the hint that no one is
really buying these chips and and that
the company missed the mark as to what
enthusiasts in the PC space are really
looking for they were kind of just
scrambling is that one of them right
there No
okay you still have a very short time to
buy them if you're so inclined but
eventually they will be end of life and
we will never see them again no one
really cares good riddance
so um thanks Brian trap for that article
that wasn't somewhere I never I never
did anything with one I think I might
have done one video this might be one
where it could it was just like why 4.3
gigahertz
don't you hate engineering examples that
don't just tell you a cpu is and you
have to look up the frequency to
match it up I'm pretty sure this is the
one that gigabyte tech tuber problem let
me borrow anyway so long TV like x may
you never rip off someone I get a very
good let's move on to Samsung's new
memory business I'm sorry Newman
Samsung's memory sector leads record q1
profits and I believe we'll be talking
more about this on Paul's half which
I'll but just to quickly introduce the
Livi the subject here Samsung posted
recently a record operating profit of
fifteen point six four trillion dollars
for q1 for q1 fifteen trillion dollars
in in in one quarter not just for the
year they Samsung I should work
for Samson all-time high of 58 percent
from that Swan by the way oh one fifteen
point six four trillion 100 sorry $1
okay you're right you're right if that
was Wohlers that would be like that
would be maybe most of the world you
wanna get laid more than like the GDP of
the United it was abnormally high okay I
forget one is spelled like the American
word one yeah they won they won 15 I
didn't even see the word one how did
they won how did they won that much I
skimmed it so quickly I've never see all
these ones I'm trying to redeem myself
from the dis from the discrete yes yeah
you coming back so that's a ton of
money even so it's been an all-time high
and key ones usually slow but there's
been such a high demand in the server
space as well as from the graphics
market for more memory so Samsung's just
been raking this in i watch the QA
asked GN with steve from gamers nexus
recently he had a question about memory
prices and you know the memory industry
and how that's gone or if graphics
prices were gonna drop back down and you
know he said straight up it's a memory
issue it's a memory issue and it's not
like there's a you know a pressing need
for memory companies to step up their
game
he said that memory companies are raking
in the dough they're making
record-breaking you know numbers and
stuff it's just you know that they don't
really see the need to to create more
RAM for the discrete GPU market because
they're already doing so well so it's
just another indication of that and you
know Samsung claims that these profits
this immense popularity for memory will
continue deep into q2
but perhaps Paul will have something
else to say about that on his half so
stay tuned for that let's move on okay
to our next article which is from Tom's
Hardware about HyperX launching their
RGB version of predators the predator at
ddr4 memory they recently revealed their
predator line which is their new
flagship memory line at PAX East
actually which I didn't get a chance to
check them out there but it's a if the
flagship line and the predator DVR for
RGB features the brand's new infrared
sync technology related hardware oh yeah
I did see that was like why why is this
here it must be a video tie so Tom's
Hardware I am disappoint by the look in
it the video even follows me like it
won't go away
oh god its turns I kind of serve up
those ads dive video ok watch all the
ends so ddr4 29:33 right 29:33 is the
only speed it's offered and right now
it's
available in one two or four a gigabyte
DIMMs so you can only get up to 32 gigs
a gig sticks or down to one a geek stick
some part of controlling the memories
color and lighting effects is done via
the motherboard so it does support Asus
MSI and gigabytes lighting software
which makes it unclear as to why they
need their patented infrared sync
technology
we're not exactly exactly sure why
that's necessary if everything's being
handled by the motherboard or at least a
large part of it but maybe more light
will be shed on that later the timings
are 15 17 17 on these kits and you can
get them now 16 gigabyte kit 16 gigabyte
kits will retail for about 249 and 32
gigs 491 I'd be curious about their rise
and compatibility meets you yeah if
they're single or dual rank and what
kind of modules are using yeah if you
can even hit 29:33 with them that would
be a good test actually and even if you
can love their like single rank and they
using samsung b dies then then you
should be fine possibly yeah but yeah
they look nice yeah it's not cast
latency 14 so I'm not sure I would I
would want to get this this the straight
dope from Kingston to find that for sure
but hey yeah let's move on to hot
hardware's article about Zen to AMD Zen
2 CPUs being sampled this year prepping
for a launch for next year Lisa sue
confirmed recently that AMD is already
sampling at 7 nanometers and 2 cores and
gearing up for a volume launch in 2019
as she mentioned that the 7 nanometre
GPU based on Vega is also doing the
sampled later this year that's more so
aimed at AI and machine learning
purposes and workloads but Zen 2 is
supposed to be at least according to su
she's thinking that there's gonna be a
higher adoption rate present - because
the word on Rison is kind of already out
like more people are now aware that AMD
Rison exists and that it
is mostly well received by the community
at large so um that there's nothing
really too much wrong with it and it's a
perfectly viable alternative to Intel
exactly yeah so um she's hoping that Zen
she's gonna take off even more with like
there's just the mainstream community
then then the first generation of Zen
processors which is pretty exciting AMD
is slammed it at the moment
according to the article they saw a
profit of 81 million dollars on a 1.65
billion dollar revenue that was just
last quarter versus you know losing
nineteen million dollars in the previous
quarter and thirty three million dollars
lost in the same quarter a year prior to
that so um Intel's really turned things
around and I think you know game D yeah
and the the whole rise and at least you
said Intel I'm sorry sorry
AMD to know I love until if they
if they could if if Radeon technologies
group could put out a competitive GPU to
follow up with the Vega then yeah they'd
really be on track but yeah I mean
they're doing really they're doing
awesome with their eyes and stuff and
Ritter / stuff than epic stuff so yeah
they've definitely been disrupting that
that whole market so we look forward to
seeing what they have in store with Zen
- so more on that when more details come
to light moving on here this articles
from Lily Pugh ting is is about Atari
the VCS is gonna ship soon actually in
2019 so next year pre-order is open may
30th which is soon for $199 and up Atari
as we all know is a very popular
old-school like super vintage now
hardware maker video game hardware maker
but now they're trying to re-enter that
business with their Atari VCS which is a
Linux based gaming console and it's
gonna include original Atari games like
pong for example what are litter some
other big Atari games super breakout
super on my favorite yeah if you've got
you've got adventure
I think adventure did you have an Atari
I never had an Atari but my grandma
my grandma bought an Atari UGA's grandma
had in the jar they cuz they like badass
my grandparents had five kids and like
all of all of their kids had kids
roughly or in the same time period so
they had lots of kids going over to my
parents house so they bought it so that
the kids going over they could play it
gotcha yeah pitfall asteroids fall I
hunters yeah you guys pole position oh I
love pole position boo defender pecker
boyce invaders that's a good one too now
that man of course can't forget pac-man
arkanoid Wow yeah so some serious
classics that are very nostalgic to a
lot of us now but there will also be
newer linux titles and i it's kind of
unclear the article doesn't go into
detail at all probably because Atari
hasn't released any but I'm curious to
see if any of these titles under
linux-based Jesus hero are gonna be
exclusive to this platform or are
they're gonna be like Linux titles that
we can still find on a windows-based
system or an Xbox or you know a ps3 for
I mean don't don't look at my ribbon
here I tried to steal it it oh don't
choke me
hero be good so yeah I don't know if
these games are gonna be exclusive and
and let's say the system is gonna
support the classic Atari style joystick
and a modern gamepad which kind of looks
like an Xbox 360 controller these will
be paired either with the console or
purchase separately depending on the
package that you get it's gonna be
shipping next year pre-orders are open
May 30th from 199 and 199 is the
earlybird special price so it could very
well be more than that once it actually
launches there will be two versions of
the console itself and onyx black
version which is I think is just kind of
a blacked out appearance versus a retro
option that has wood paneling I think
that's maybe the one that they have a
in the picture which looks pretty cool
and not all the packages will ship with
both controllers I'm kind of curious to
see if if this is gonna have you know
any games on it that will and any
similar games like any of the same games
that are already on existing consoles
Atari with USB 3.0 I just had never
thought I'd those two things in one
sentence crazy or if you know or if
you're gonna be able to do
cross-platform play with other consoles
because I feel like that's that's a big
part of gaming now is playing with other
people online it's huge right like
that's it's everything so I mean if
Atari is just gonna be a closed off
ecosystem where you can't cross-platform
play with Xbox users or PlayStation
users not sure exactly how far they're
gonna get here but very curious to see
how it all turns out and then finally we
have an article from ARS technica which
is about Comcast's not one to give speed
boosts to Internet users who don't buy
TV services bundled with them Comcast
customers don't deserve speed boosts
this is this is really kinda lame
because Comcast's you know I guess I'll
set the stage first they've the like
cord cutters I have really taken a toll
on the Comcast business model Comcast is
currently the biggest cable provider TV
provider in the nation and they
currently have more Internet users than
TV subscribers more Internet users than
TV watchers which is insane and and
their their TV business is slowly
declining they lost one hundred and
fifty thousand users from their TV
sector last year so what they've done
what they're doing now is they're trying
to you know provide the incentives for
people to latch onto these TV bundles by
saying hey we're up in all of your
speeds we're gonna up your speed your
ear at 16 megabits per second right now
down we're gonna up that to a hundred
and fifty how you like the sound of that
hey you're at a hundred zone you're at
150 megabits per second well up you to
250 and you're at 250 pull up you to 400
megabytes per second megabytes megabits
sorry this is revolution tamir oh um
but you know what here's the catch
people if you want these free upgrades
to your download speeds then
you have to bundle in a TV package you
got it you got it you got to take your
cut cord and plug it back in you got a
rebandage it and now you have to have a
TV subscription of some kind if you want
to get these tremendously
you know increased speed benefits so
this is currently applying to people in
Houston and Washington know you're gonna
say it's gonna say it's almost like
they're subsidizing the cost of the
internet with the constant TV that's
exactly what they're doing very astute
observation Paul very astute very astute
and you know I don't know Comcast
currently like the comp I feel like
Comcast is always pulling out some sort
of weird offer but they're constantly
trying to just manipulate their
customers with well they were I mean the
cable TV providers were able to create a
system that was very profitable for them
and the Internet is a way of getting an
entertainment without having to do that
system yeah there's lots of ad hoc
internet-based services that you can pay
directly for that single channel or
video feed or whatever and you don't
necessarily have to pay for every single
thing like you do with the cable package
where you pay for 1200 channels that you
watch two of or something like that so
exactly yeah TV is a way that all these
ISPs have full control over the consumer
base and the internet is just kind of a
Wild West situation where the ISPs don't
have that much control they can control
the speeds that I can control the
content like they do with TV so they're
losing tons and tons of money which is
explains why they want net neutrality to
die and so forth and that's a whole
other topic but you know it's also the
reason why well talk to us talk more
about net neutrality next week yep
because it'll be two days before oh yeah
the net neutrality and mentality stuff I
believe officially evaporates in the US
which is on May 9th right exciting times
so yeah Comcast you suck and that's all
I want to say for or my half okay we can
dive into some donations thank you guys
so much for donating we can read all the
comments you've attached those green
dots other cheek
yes five dollars you guys the best my
favorite videos and livestreams shut up
and take my Doris thank you Guido thank
we don't we love you mr. Sulu CH M b67
13 dollars and 37 cents as always
congratulations on reaching 1 million
subscribers Kyle thank you and B I
appreciate the the kind words I just
grabbed you like was that was IU that
was another man thank you very much MB I
appreciate a man Ryan Flannigan $4.99
should I build should I custom build my
PC or use NZXT BLD depends on how much
money you'd be saving on your graphics
card particularly by going the BLB route
if you're gonna be saving a significant
amount of money to you then I would go
that route if you value the experience
of building a system yourself more than
the amount of money you'd be saving on a
graphics card then build it yourself
but but but part a PC yet and then see
how much that same PC and the XT could
put together for you and you know yeah
yeah check the check both out check on
that coalition gaming Clym dollars any
chance of glean contest to win a guest
appearance on spec attack
you know actually that's really funny
that you mention that because I was just
talking to wifey sauce yesterday and I
came I came to that idea like what if we
had like a random fan just be a guest on
styling which would most likely be way
better at see csgo or any game than I am
okay there probably kick your ass they'd
probably kick my ass which I think would
be really freaking cool it's like you've
had just random fan just had Heather
rates me you've had Heather on has a bit
of a pushover
yeah pad me odd who's like slightly less
of a pushover but slightly and you
obviously stack the deck in your favor
so that I would lose but that's not true
yeah I mean a random fan you never know
you never know what you're gonna get
there that's true wild card you did have
the possibility of then dressing that
random fan
up and putting makeup on them and stuff
afterwards Holly wouldn't we wouldn't we
wouldn't give him such a harsh
punishment that's we only saved that for
that you know I'm lowest lowest members
of society at enter show anyways about
to say I'm flattered through that
backhand you're welcome
bazinga X $100 holy crap damn
appreciate it man or whenever you are I
have I 7 59 60 X time to upgrade stock
ticker word several Excel sheets Outlook
VPN remote connection Skype game or
movie visual studio all running at the
same time I 979 ATX e or thread Ripper
and Y in this case I will be upgrading
the entire system go a thread Ripper I
initial gut because it Y is $1,000 yeah
exactly that is lay low a cheaper for
it's a very similar just an amazing it's
an amazing ship I'm using a 1950 X right
now at home it's replacing hotline
temporarily while I work on that so I've
been very happy with it so far and it's
just like Paul said the money difference
is staggering yeah I mean it's not that
big of a drop off from the 79 TXE not at
all and like $1000 yes like holy crap I
haven't looked into 79 80 XE has it gone
on sale is it like 1500 down instead of
1,800 or whatever the hell they were
probably are doing probably not that way
yeah the the 1950 ex was on sale fact
seven hundred and thirty dollars that's
crazy bus what a few days ago or
something good Wow
alright ah the berserker here the
berserk healer five dollars best hosts
to drink with keep being awesome poem
cow thank you for secondly we shall
leave a drink to you but we're out of
beer yeah I'm gonna get more fix that
soon Joshua craft $5.00 should I upgrade
from risin five sixteen hundred to a
risin 720 700 X I stream to twitch and
was wondering whether or not I would
benefit from the extra cores in clock
speed you definitely would you you
definitely would well he's doing live
transcoding or live encoding I should
say by streaming
jump from doing like with the Intel quad
core quad core with hyper-threading to
the six core and six quarts well thread
rise in CPUs he has to be benefitting
but I don't know if there's another if
there's another decent jump from going
from six to eight on the resin side
specifically with streaming if you do if
you're feeding through if you capture
footage and you transcode it or that
kind of thing
then it would be worth it because it's
that's that's raw compute performance
and and you'll get a decent boost gun
from the 612 to 816 you're also getting
access to faster clock speeds with a
second gen risin so that's that's gonna
help that's gonna help you as the gamer
like I think the extra cores are gonna
help your viewers have and appreciate a
better quality stream but I think the
faster clock speeds that come along the
second gen Rison are gonna help you the
gamer get higher FPS while you're
streaming so that you can both have an
equally enjoyable experience so I think
it's a pretty I think it's a pretty
worthy upgrade honestly it depends if
you're streaming once a week or a couple
times a month then probably not but if
you're streaming multiple times a week I
think it's I think it's a good call I
think that's one of the you're a prime
example of why AMD has made they aim for
platform so Universal between
generations of of CPUs and I think you
should take advantage of this huge perk
that comes along with buying into the
Reisman platform but those are my two
cents thank you very much Joshua Joshua
again $5 also I ran out of beer
yesterday I have upset
oof yeah I would be upset if I render
the beer too
but you know what we have these things
in California called liquor stores which
are incredibly convenient so conveniens
in fact that sometimes people call them
convenience stores and we typically read
up our beer at these locations and
everything becomes good again in the
world so maybe you look into one of
those bradley long $5 hey guys happy to
catch you live my question is with the
release of Verizon East use do you plan
on building small form-factor builds
passive cooling straight straight comm
case I'm always into small form-factor
builds that is what I live for
so I'll definitely be checking out some
of these rise and excuse the future 35 5
watt TDP versions yes ap use yes exactly
so might make a really good home theater
PC chip or maybe a super light gaming
rig or something like that but yeah well
we'll keep our eyes on those Scott
Dilbeck six dollars and sixty six cents
Cheers cheers to you my friend mr. Scott
here Scott El Jefe reviews $5 congrats
on the 1 million subs milestone Kyle El
Jefe is proud of you and that is all I
ever wanted in life El Jefe so thank you
to all anyone really wants it's true
I'll have his approval
well you might also want a $10 donation
from TV ciao I think my main system has
am i some sort of shock due to my custom
roof I have another made the time or
easier to fix adieu to school and I need
to replace my GT X 1080
all the power surprised I'm a scared
power hold me hold me by my bowels hold
me by my boss and put the balls by the
bowl set you're putting words into my
PJs mouth baby touched the curve I mean
you're already have made such a no there
was already an assumption as to what his
accent might be pretty good right he's
just your main what if he's Jamaican or
something but he has like it like an
English accent like like is actually
super just sophisticated with just
distinguish like he went and went to
Cambridge or something what was that
fancy place we went to for the Nvidia
thing oh no a Scott Scott a Scott yeah
yeah a Scott that place was fancy
that was the word yeah really really
rich people live all right Thank You TVs
baby I'm sorry if I ever insult you with
my daughter's name
donating money thanks man
blue five seven nine nine five dollars
with the inger imager link which I'm
I'll let Paul click on will additional
RAM improved gaming performance in to
build like this any thoughts for next
steps thanks Ram I mean only if you're
like dealing with like 8 or less gigs
will you really benefit from more RAM
especially if you're 67 hundred kg to
mcgi
16 gigs of ram you don't need more RAM
yeah what card 1080i oh you have plenty
of RAM envy right
okay here you're golden you're golden me
but you have a you have a extremely
powerful system with not much to to be
added to it that wouldn't be overkill
the only thing the only thing you might
be slightly limited on would be gaming
and streaming at the same time yeah in
which case you'd need to go for a
completely different platform since he
can't get a 6 core Intel processor on
your current platform just one of the
things that we criticize Intel about
recently since AMD doesn't have that
same limitation this is true and finally
we have Miguel piñero
5 Australia's hey guys love the content
keep it up Thank You Miguel what would
you guys say is the best bang for your
buck CPU for video editing right Rison 7
great now yeah I mean 2700 X the 2600 or
the 27 sorry the 2700 or 2700 X if you
want a coarse 16 thread and if you have
three hundred or three hundred and
thirty dollars
I think the $2,700 $2,700 you can get
the 2600 X and I would recommend the
2600 X over the 2600 simply because the
Wraith spire is decently better cooler
than the race stealth so you do get a
higher clock speed and a better cooler
for your thirty bucks thing so - and so
yeah it's just how much you want to
spend ideally
the the 16-core but if you want to get
kind of a bang for the buck type thing
then go for the six core I'm sorry eight
core 16 thread six square pulse right
okay I got you
yeah all right and then finally we can
finish off this half of the show with
some Johnson's shout out yes Pete yeah
I'm not coming to Dutch Dutch you son of
a bitch you picked up a CPU cooler navy
blue shirt and an evolution metal gray
shirt thank you Guido and Johnson teal
blue dos other jobs also a frequent
donator thank you for your purchase of
the sword fight gaming MOSFET we should
both thank you for that so it's a it's a
yeah awesome hardware much veto Johnson
to you thank you so much yes yes
Jason CPU cooler appreciated man some
you cooler and maybe blue
David classic was that a David knows a
Jason David from New Jersey got the Ox
the oxblood thumbscrew shakes thank you
thank you so much David Jeff you don't
get to double Johnson logo blacks nice
nice I'm sailing good in that truck a
break on sale hell yeah
hunter from Alabama gotten to the
thumbscrew decals well as the treble end
the great tri-blend Thank You Johnson to
you hundred double Johnson for hunter in
the house bit with circle logo decal
fidget spinner and a bit with gray logo
tri-blend t-shirt and finally for me Ben
P from Kansas got the pub glass to glass
set and for that I say cheers bang I
think that was a full double Johnson
three many double Johnson Osman first
time you got a hot streak full streak in
and asked the audience first time we got
double Johnson Street press event is
Jesus Wow holy crap guys so many records
yes that today guys never be able to top
this episode is very sad also exciting
guys thank you so much for tuning in if
you'd like to do some time stamps for me
in the comments I'd be very appreciative
and I'll pin your comments and give you
a nice little comment and stuff but
don't go anywhere because as part to
ciebie is just around the corner
turnt up momentarily chemo
so yeah stay tuned for that give us give
us a little preview Paul just like
preview what are we talking about your
half n Cal has canceled they're not
cancelled they've delayed their 10
nanometre products ok nice candle Malik
and something might have good news 2019
a bit of a Vega 20 leaked and then of
course more discussion of the DRAM
situation the high prices yes and a
lawsuit that has been filed in the
United States we all have a good lawsuit
here in America and class action so cool
so stay tuned for all that it's right
around the corner in just a few seconds
so we will be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
