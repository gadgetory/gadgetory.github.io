yeah you got white girl wasted and you
scored coke you probably screwed a
hooker who robbed you and then you woke
up in a crack house probably after doing
crack no no no okay love a good girl
will scratch the crack barb you were in
the hangover weren't you was that
hangover 2 or hangover 3
yeah I get arrested for a weekend oh
yeah for a speeding ticket what that was
a year old yeah like you didn't pay it
or something like that well yeah I
forgot about it you know you get them
tickets you just forget about some time
right right oh I it was like the first
it was it was like the first day of the
fair around where I'm at so like I lost
track of that ticket and then I moved so
i didn't get none of the notices that
they were sent amino they didn't take it
you know blah blah right and i moved out
of the county so it was like on a figure
it was like saturday Saturday morning
right yeah they had a cop from one
County come out wait at the borderline
of that county and then another cop from
that county come out to arrest me oh my
god a rest of me in that county drove me
to the border put me in the car now the
funny thing about it was is that the guy
who gave me the ticket like a year
previously was the guy driving the car
on that day so you he's like if I if I
hadn't known you know that this would
happen I would have never wrote you the
ticket so I had to go in this hard-ass
bench in Hamburg New York I had to go
and sleep in the cell for two nights
until the judge came back oh my god I
just came back because they had a weight
they couldn't let me out without me
seeing the judge right that's for taking
um well he gave me like McDonald's cuz
you know but I thought that was about it
I was sitting in his cell I felt like
clicking a pen but dating they took my
shoelaces to like I was gonna kill
myself over speeding ticket wow so how
do they how do they actually go about a
rest like did they show up at your door
and like you're arrested yeah they are
you know are you so so yes you're under
arrest you know it's like for a meeting
yeah wow I jokes on them cuz i guess i
got the free mcdonalds which is like I
guess three bucks amelie a black coffee
in a hamburger for lunch
I I happen to imagine that's like a
thousand times better than like typical
jail food though oh yeah that's like
that's like what you asked for for your
last meal when you're on death row like
I'll take an egg mcmuffin please yeah
well that's cool that's a good story man
thanks for sharing that from
you
you
okay so so before before we get too
ahead of ourselves why don't we just why
don't we start from the beginning like
and I want you to take your time with
this because it sounds like it could be
a pretty epic story hopefully with the
happy ending but walk walk me through
this whole scenario okay well I'm
married two kids been that way for about
five six years now and one day my kids
they got I forget what the sickness is
called but it was some childlike
sickness that when child children aren't
really subsec tible to it but adults are
absolute just fucking destroyed by it so
anyways the sickness goes around the
house and its two main symptoms are
projectile vomiting and projectile
shitty quite literally everywhere at the
same time oh no I don't like where this
is going every about 20 to 30 minutes I
was rushing up to get to the bathroom
now to lay out this a little bit more I
was having my office out in the time out
in the barn which was about a 30-yard
walk to the house now imagine that with
ass exploding runs trying to waddle my
ass to the house it's 30 fucking yards
away and up a flight of stairs to get to
the toilet I assume yeah make it well I
made it all the times except for once
this one time I didn't make it I
realized I had to shit and I knew it was
gonna be a fuckin violent one so I stood
up instantly which was a huge fucking
mistake because he immediately it
started leaking just so here I am trying
to clench my ass you so hard together
that it's actually fucking hurting are
you even to the house yet are you like
still walking from the body I'm just
getting up out of my fucking chair I've
never even been out my fucking office ok
anyway so here I am I'm sitting there
I'm holding my ass cheese together with
my fucking hands and I look over trying
to find out what
I should do and I see basically my he'll
marry a white trash can from walmart at
this time i also had a dog named zoe and
she was always in my office she already
knows what's gonna fucking happen she's
looking at me like death she's over
there in the fucking corner looking at
me with big old pleading eyes like
please fucking don't dad of course by
this point I know I can't make it to the
bathroom so I waddle my ass and each
step I take I'm leaking a little bit
more over to this trash can and I just
get down my pants and I drop myself
above this trash can and I let it live
by the time I finished both my ass
cheeks were pretty well fucked you know
is you're not putting on your pants back
after that ruin your fucking pants so I
look around and I find a very old
blanket that my dog had been using so
with as much dignity as I could muster
in this whole fucked-up shit I proceeded
to wipe my ass in front of my dog with
her Blake she didn't look at me right
for at least the next year did if he had
told me that whole thing that whole
scenario was actually possible before
that point I would have called you a
fucking liar oh yeah but now I've
experienced it myself and I'm just you
naggers no sharing greater in my life
than that point that must really be the
lowest low that I've ever I've ever
heard probably is my low is low
alright we are approaching our
destination just couple blocks east of
our location what you're gonna do you're
gonna get in the car and you're gonna
stay there if you get out I will find
cute and i will race that is horrifying
okay I'm gonna do that so how old are
you like 16 15 I'm only 11 I or 11 ok so
being an 11 year old i'm sure you have a
wealth of life experience under your
belt so what is what is the quite
possibly the worst thing or the craziest
thing that you've ever done in your in
your 11 years of life I don't know I
haven't really done much like happier
have you have you ever gotten grounded
yeah what was what was like the the
worst thing that you got grounded for
feeling something ah stealing something
we got a klepto on our hands not only a
rapist but a kleptomaniac as well what
did you what did you steal animal a
stuffed animal did it did it have liked
to have drugs in it was there like you
know like a kilo in there like you get a
break out of it at least or was just
kind of it was it it was an angry bird
in angry birds stuffed animal wow I'm
sure you had to deal with it an angry
mom not so stuffed animal after that I
wanted it and it was like in second
grade always do it and then like so this
was this was no you stole this you still
don't like me because of it so you stole
this from another classmate I'm assuming
then
yeah I wasn't an idiot oh well if he's
an idiot then he totally deserved it
they didn't so didn't they didn't make
you do any hard time for that hi this
pen I got detention for Dewey I just end
like letters every day like the same
exact letter three times like every day
like all five of them my dad took me to
the police officer made me talk to a cop
and she's like like like I don't want to
have to put you back there in that
bought so so he pretty much took you
there to teach a lesson more or less
yeah but if it the cop was hot right she
who knows he's a beam she's she's a
she's a beat ya like like the vegetable
or like a beast yeah like a monster boom
beach like she's a beach Oh like a like
it my guy a beat you get yeah I get it
dead must be that gangster slang term
that I kids are using these days alright
so that was a pretty crazy story I have
to admit I don't think I've heard anyone
else in my life do anything that crazy
but have you have you ever been in love
lots of time lots of times I I assumed
