and grip to learn more click on the link
below what's going on guys welcome back
so today we're actually gonna be
assembling a budget gaming PC in the
price range of around seven hundred and
seventy five dollars which was the cost
of everything that you see here at the
time of filming basically the point of
today's build is to build a decent
gaming PC that can also handle streaming
particularly with the title fortnight as
it is the hottest game right now so
hopefully it's relevant enough and some
of you guys are interested in building a
PC similar to this one the other thing
that I want to mention is that will
actually be doing a streaming test
that'll be a separate video from this
one and it's gonna be weird because the
the streaming video is actually gonna
hit the YouTube channel before this
video does and the reason for that is
because this video actually has to live
on floatplane a week early so there's
gonna be a bit of swap you time travel
stuff going on so hopefully that's not
too confusing that being said we are
gonna do a little bit of gameplay
testing with fortnight at the end of
this video so make sure you stay tuned
for that so we can check on the
performance of the system we've just
assembled so starting with the parts
here we've got an arrow cool Cylon this
is a fifty dollar case and it's so it's
super budget it's got a tempered glass
note actually it looks like tempered
glass but it's actually acrylic and
somehow it managed to ship without any
visible scratches it's kind of
miraculous we'll see exactly how long
that lasts though additionally we have a
couple 120 mounts at the front a 120 fan
at the back there's enough room for
cable management behind the motherboard
tray there's a power supply basement so
you can route more cables there for a
cleaner looking system proper dust
filtration you also get USB three at the
front and a built-in micro and regular
SD card reader which is kind of
interesting for a budget PC or a budget
case but okay and full disclaimer full
disclosure arrow cool is sponsoring this
build as well as the case obviously so
without them this build and this video
would not have been possible so thanks
to them if you want to check out this
case I'll put a link for that in the
description along with all
other components that we have here
additionally we have our CP which is the
AMD rise in 1600 a fantastic cpu still
one of the best bang for the buck
options on the market in my opinion it's
got six cores and twelve threads and
honestly if we weren't making this a
streaming oriented PC we could probably
get away with a much cheaper CPU than
this one but the the multi-threaded
element here is really gonna help us out
on that live in coding aspect we also
have an Asus Prime be 350 plus
motherboard a tried and true option in
my experience personally that is also
gonna be able to get us some pretty
decent overclocks with our CPU it's got
all the connectivity we'd also need for
a budget gaming PC memory we have a dual
channel eight gigabyte kit of g.skill
ripjaws five ddr4 at 3200 speed and
remember memory frequency is very
important when it comes to a Rison based
system because of its integration with
Infinity fabric and how it works in the
Zen architecture if this was an Intel
based system he probably could have
gotten away with a cheaper / slower kit
but all things considered this should
actually help our frame rate out quite a
bit our graphics card is the gtx 1050 TI
from msi now I don't have the actual
retail packaging for that card so we're
using a 1050 box with some slight
modifications there as you can see but
this is a great card it's got a 4
gigabyte frame buffer it should be
plenty for fortnight's as I think the
recommended specs is a gtx 660 on the
geforce side since for several
generations ahead here with a TI model
of the 1050 i think it's gonna be just
fine to tear through some frames in that
particular title it's also one of the
cheapest 1050 TI's you can find right
now on the market across Amazon and
Newegg I think the retail price was 220
dollars on new egg which is at least 10
to 15 bucks cheaper than all the other
models I could find we also have a 550
watt power supply from EVGA there's no
other gaming oriented branding here it's
it's more of a budget entry-level unit
but you still get 80 plus bronze
certification and the cables are all
sleeved in black so even though we have
a budget system here we don't have to
compromise with any nasty ketchup and
mustard cables thank God and then
finally we have our storage down there
in a 55 256 gig silicon power SSD which
we're going to be putting our operating
system and frequently used applications
on - I've actually used this SSD in a
recent build and I'm using it again here
it's just sort of recycling it because
it's one of the cheaper options that you
can find at that capacity I think it was
only 60
for bucks the time of filming which is
fantastic price price takea gray she oh
and then finally we have our one
terabyte mechanical hard drive in the
form of a Seagate Barracuda for our
games of course and other backup media
files and those are all the parts for
the build ladies and gentlemen again
I'll put links to all the stuff in the
description though without further ado
let's go ahead and get assembling this
PC before diving into what's hopefully a
smooth and enjoyable fortnight
experience
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
all right the build is complete you can
see I've already jumped into fortnight
not wasting any time here and I've
already died I'm actually spectating one
of my squad mates just a random dude
he's probably much better than I am so
it little least be more interesting to
watch him than me
and we still get a look at the
performance that we're getting on this
PC for for the record we're using high
settings the way Fortnite works you can
go low medium high or epic I didn't
really see a huge difference visually
speaking going from high to epic but it
did tank our framerate quite a bit so I
didn't really see a point in going epic
so that's why we're on high still looks
beautiful everything looks really crisp
were of course in 1920 by 1080 here in
windowed mode and we also have a
framerate he wraps counter anywhere from
60 to 80 FPS depending on the scene that
we're looking at which is fantastic and
when I was playing I actually gamed for
a good half an hour or so with the
current settings and it's really smooth
it's super super smooth of course we're
not streaming yet so time will tell to
see how that holds up but everything's
looking really good so far I did want to
mention that instead of the the Rison 5
1600 I actually had to swap it out for a
1600 X you can see here in hardware
monitor it's actually the X Q because
the 1600 that I have on hand didn't
realize or I completely forgot that it's
in use at the moment and it's it's
actually not very convenient for me to
get to it right now so that's why I had
to swap it out for the X but this is
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz which a non
X 1600 s be able to hit no problem
unless you get really unlucky and you
have a below-average chip but for the
most part you shouldn't see really any
performance degradation or difference
for that matter going from a 1600 X to a
1600 given our current settings now what
will change with a 1600 X is your
temperatures because now we're dealing
with a 95 watt TDP chip as opposed to 65
watts which is why we're kind of getting
warm here at 81 degrees C which is a
little bit toasty for my liking I rest
assured I would say anywhere from a 5 to
10 degree drop could be seen going to an
on X 1600 of course will verify that
later our memory you can see is running
at 3000 megahertz as opposed to 32
hundred which is what we were striving
for that's because 3200 speedram was
crashing the game non-stop I would play
for about 30 seconds I'd get into the
game and it would crash every single
time it took me a long time to figure
out that it was actually our memory
causing the issue just the actual
frequency was too high I'm not sure if
it's an incompatibility thing or it's
just not playing nicely with with the
game could be a little bug in the game
who knows by dialing it down to 3,000
megahertz doesn't affect our framerate
all that much going from 32 and it does
allow us to play the game very stable II
so that's what we're running out there
as far as our GPU goes I did overclock
our 1050 Ti with a 170 megahertz offset
on the core clock and a 300 megahertz
offset on the memory clock that took us
to around 1600 and 50-ish megahertz give
or take kind of fluctuating there and
then memory speed is at 17 hundred and
fifty-two megahertz
GPU temp is 69 degrees Celsius which is
pretty solid no red flags there and
looks like we're eating about two and a
half gigs of erm at the moment so plenty
of breathing room there a rapid things
up here the system is looking really
capable so far if you're just looking to
game with some fortnight at 1080p
obviously the performance is an
earth-shattering but it's very playable
very very smooth and enjoyable I think
anyone's gonna be really happy with this
level of performance obviously the 1600
X is getting a little too hot for my
liking I'm definitely gonna be swapping
it out for the 1600 when I start
streaming which again that video should
already be up on the channel just so we
don't overheat but everything else is
looking really good so guys let me know
what you think if you would do anything
differently with the build itself what
you think of the performance so far I'm
sure you guys have an opinion as always
leave it down below I'd love to read all
about it
apart from that guys toss me a like on
the video if you enjoyed it it always
helps and feel free to get subscribed to
the channel for more tech stuff coming
at you really soon you can also check me
out on floatplane if you want to watch
my videos a week early
without ads for 3 bucks a month I'll
leave a link for that in the video
description
apart from that thanks again for tuning
in have yourselves a good one and I'll
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
