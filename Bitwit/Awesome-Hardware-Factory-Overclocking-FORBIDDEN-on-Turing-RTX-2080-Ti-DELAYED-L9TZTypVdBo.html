yeah thanks okay we should be live any
moment
okay I'm gonna tweet that we're both
live tweeting the real life to both
YouTube and twitch that in the show-off
rate yep
hello everyone hopefully you can hear us
in CS lab and clear this is awesome
hardware episode 162 you're watching
side a in about half an hour or so we'll
be switching gears to pulse half on
history Tube channel so you can follow
the link in my video description to find
his half or you can just stay where you
are if you're on Twitch because we
streamed the show its entirety here and
yeah that's that's pretty much it I
should also say that we like to have a
few drinks on the show I'm so if you're
if you if you're drinking too then
Cheers
go ahead oh oh sure yeah that's right
me first and then also we occasionally
use adult language on the show so if you
have problem with that maybe you have
kids around and you don't want this to
scar their ears for life then be warned
holy moly thick like molasses oh boy
this is 12% beer sent from a fan do we
know this is seven fan the fan who sent
all those really large awesome beers and
you need to go back and double-check the
original video where we did the unboxing
of them cuz we apparently have lost the
card that was that was with it but um
this is Hubbard's cave Elza Catan oh my
god the smell 12%
just imperialist up fermented on toasted
oak with almond flour cacao nibs
cinnamon sticks vanilla beans and show
chilies guajillo chilies and habanero
chilies so just just smell it like take
a whiff it doesn't even smell like beer
it smells like oh this is so much going
on there's a lot going on there okay Wow
cheers thank you and Cheers man you guys
thank you guys um shop
that's highly complex as I feel like I
need to think about it yeah it tastes
just like it smells to make sense so
while I think about Kyle we have stores
buy things buy things from rising summer
stores my store is bit with tech and
there you'll find an assortment of
merchandise sure smells patents goodness
more shirts bottle openers glasses
beautiful glasses more more bottle
openers and then go to upholster as well
paul sartre brunette you'll find an
assortment of shirts mouse pads bottle
openers more shirts and glasses
beautiful glasses so sold out of the air
to be everything true maybe they're not
sold out on my hair throughout my my
store if you buy stuff we will give you
a shout out during the after party which
will be on Twitch and in case Kylie
mentioned all this is being streamed
both to YouTube live and it's a twitch
live twitch.tv slash house of hardware
yes
alright let's just dive into the news
shall we yes because we got a lot to
talk about today quite a bit quite a few
things going on and starting with our
new segment we have a brand new segment
oh yeah which is not news so we're not
doing news is what you're saying
we're doing greens down green stuff
green stuff is a new segment trying out
the green stuff this is totally
different than news it is simply news
about invidious stuff Oh green stuff get
it it's because they're green alright
this indirectly is very very creative
highly creative segment I thought about
all the way last night alright so
there's a lot of things going on with
the video of course with the r-tx lunch
coming up and stuff like that starting
with this article from tech power up
they did some digging recently and and
while they were testing their r-tx cards
with gpu-z they found that well I guess
I should read the headline first NVIDIA
has been segregating or they will be
segregating their Turing GPUs some of
which can be factory overclocked by the
board partner or the end user or by the
board partner or and and and they'll
also be making some SKUs some Asics that
do not support
factory overclocking it's completely
forbidden segregation it's interesting
segregation yeah segregation is not is
not something to be is usually suddenly
frowned upon in today's society but look
at this Nvidia segregating things but
may may or may not should be says let's
say
various variances so so they noticed
they noticed on their cheat RTX 28 ET i
that had two device IDs and device ID
basically tells windows which which
software to load for a specific model of
card tells the driver which commands to
send to the card based on that ID so
most cards actually all nvidia cards in
the past have only carried one device ID
per skew but the RT x 28 e TI and
apparently the RT x 2080 have two device
IDs on each one so it's very peculiar
and what what what would tech power up
discovered is that these two IDs
correspond to two different ASIC codes
per GPU models so there's the tu 102 300
which is designed to be used on cards
targeting the MSRP so this is more like
entry-level cards that that are that are
a bit more lower priced and maybe don't
have factory overclocking out of the box
and then there's the tu 102 300 a that a
at the end is is the big differentiator
there that's for reserved for custom
cards designed for overclocking so your
asus rog Strix OSI model your your EVGA
for the win or a super super clock
models that let all come factory
overclock those have a specific ASIC now
and a specific device ID that
corresponds to that bad GPU letting
letting the system know and the driver
know that this card can be factory
overclocked it won't be possible without
that a SKU on on your GPU both of the
same physical chip I should reiterate
that it's just it's just one that's one
is it has been Bend for overclocking
better better better power efficiency
and things like that so yeah that's not
to say don't get too worried about that
because you'll still be able to manually
overclock either SKU or either either
device ID either ASIC that should be
noted but the atom boy partner and the
board partners just won't be able to
tune the non a device ID parts the other
thing to note here that the article
mentioned is that this could prevent
potentially didn't confirm but it could
potentially prevent users and users from
taking like buying like a cheaper
entry-level priced card at MSRP and then
flashing it with like a
custom factory overclocked cards bios in
order to take advantage of those higher
clock speeds that may not be possible
with with a with a specific device ID
but if you can manually overclock then
that's that I feel like that's a little
bit more advanced than menu manually
overclocking so if you could so many
manually over my question would be in my
table where I've been to the point where
the so the a the - a variance can be
overclocked and so if you have an on - a
variant would that would that is that a
Binns chip that performed that under
performs like there are the - a ones all
over performing binned GPUs yes all the
- A's are apparently been so so I guess
with the articles in there they're
better so they're better there are way
better um which I guess sort of confirms
that NVIDIA has been every single Turing
GPU that they that they manufacture at
least for GP I'm sorry tu 102 and tu-104
those are all being Bend by Nvidia and
then they're they're sending them off
into two camps the excuse for
overclocking and the non a scuse for you
know your basic bitch models okay so
that's that there's a lot us know what
you think about that is this is this
blasphemy to gamers everywhere or is
does this not really make much of a
difference I could see it being a bummer
for people who have traditionally
flashed their cards with with a fancy
bios or something like that people who
looked for a bargain by buying the base
clocks versions of the card and then
overclocking it themselves like it
sounds like you're gonna have to buy an
overclocked version of the card already
to get the GPU that overclocks the best
yes absolutely oh yeah yeah yeah true
moving on moving on more in green stuff
Nvidia shield TV now supports 120 Hertz
and up to the Wi-Fi bandwidth for their
GeForce now streaming application so
this this new upgrade or yeah it was the
the 7.1 shield experience upgrade that
they just released this week now
supports 120 Hertz refresh rates at sub
4k resolutions based on the BAMF
limitations of the HD
I poured on there this is mainly aimed
gaming and streaming games based either
from g-force now or from a from a
connected g-force based system that you
have
you know locally connected in your house
or something that's mainly because there
isn't a whole lot of 120 Hertz video
content out there it's just not it's
just not very common right out of people
broadcasting know that refresh rate so
which is weird because there's a lot of
120 Hertz TVs out there but you could
argue they're not true 120 Hertz and all
that but anyway there's also support for
non QWERTY keyboards if you're into that
which improves and also improvements to
accuracy of mouse movements in g-force
now have been made that was simply by
disabling the Android mouse acceleration
feature apparently there's some annoying
feature in Android that accelerates your
mouse which is bad for gaming that's
been taken care of okay and then also a
pretty big one here is that previously
prior to this update for whatever reason
the Wi-Fi bandwidth was being throttled
or just wasn't realizing its full
potential when you opened up the g-force
now app so now the improvements from
Wi-Fi bandwidth to this app have been
improved by 5x what's that's good which
you know if you're gonna be streaming at
a triple-a game I would imagine that
having good Wi-Fi is probably important
if you're not hardwired in or anything
so it's nice to see that Nvidia is
continuing support for their shield TV
gamers both the casual and the hardcore
it seems like that would line up more
with the VF big big freaking gaming
displays that they aren't launching this
year but they're still are supposed to
launch next year yeah when charts I
believe supposed to be a hundred
forty-four Hertz refresh rate
mm-hm but they are g-sync so I would
assume that you could also type through
dude through the you know that this
would be its user gaming PC through the
shield TV and stop g-sync support oh
yeah 120 Hertz refresh rate right that
would be sweet yeah moving on we've got
an article from overclocked 3d net this
is just
really quick one pictures yeah I love
articles with just oh wait no sorry I
skipped one Anandtech sorry about that
I'm getting ahead of myself uh NVIDIA
has delayed the availability for their
r-tx 20 atti by about a week a week
going from September 20th which was like
in two days you were about to get one in
two days and now you're gonna have to
wait till September 27th a whole seven
days that sucks
gee whiz what an inconvenience he told
people not to pre-order yep and this is
why just get disappointed but you can
still create are the r-tx 2080 that's
still available and it will be launching
September 20th
so pre-order that that's in two days
right now just just throw your money at
this pre-order don't wait for the
reviews how should I get
hashtag Tom's Hardware hash tag / s /
yes sure that's that's really all for
that article it's been delayed we don't
really know why it could be - probably
get ready - there's a shortage of them
like being like on a IC IC and I'll see
train tracks you know going through just
like some minor yes and there's a train
you know with the car full of them on
there yep then there's like a shootout
oh yeah bandits on the train and a big
explosion graphics card bandits and
that's what I imagine that's probably
part of what went on to cause this delay
is if that's really what happened I'd
give them like a three day delay and
most yeah a weeks just obscene that's
why I said that's part of it obviously
the feature-length film going over it
I'll take a little bit longer the lead
of imagine I imagine it will feature
real time range tracing them and and
jetsam Huang's character will be played
by none other than Jason Statham she
didn't stay them as Jensen I could see
him within the jacket that great jacket
would work he probably already wears one
of those yeah all right they know each
other alright moving on here this is the
article that it was talking about
momentarily
a bit ago uh this is from overclocked 3d
Donette
and it's pictures I love articles and
pictures because you can just look at
him like a jewel that's so visual some
colors so the RG Strix 2070 or I should
say the ROG 2070 Strix OC
sometimes it's weird because sometimes a
C's puts tricks before the model and
sometimes they put it after it's it I
don't like it but although it says ROG
Strix on the box
ROG r-tx 2070 Strix yeah that's
confusing anyway there's a Strix in
there somewhere so you've got the more
premium overclocked one probably or
definitely has that a that a skew ASIC
on it that we just talked about because
it's factory overclocked and then
there's the RT x 2070 dual you can tell
because it's got dual fans as opposed to
triple that on the Strix so let's talk
about these the art V Strix model
clearly as a triple heatsink triple fan
heatsink design and the fans are not
quite but not quite like the the ones on
the RT x 2080 or 28 ECI those those
axial tech fans that we've seen pictures
of but rather they're more familiar more
more I guess they're borrowed from
that's in the other room okay
these fans are more like of the Pascal
ones that we've seen that we're familiar
with they're probably just recycling
they're reusing unused Pascal fans
there's also a - I've got one right here
there he is this is the Asus Archie X
2070 what what for all you know this
says GTX right there shut up okay
it's the RT X as you can see raining on
your parade nope
I mean it could very well be right hold
on let me see you is this from that
although look at the right here oh no
yeah no it's exactly the same shroud and
everything yeah it's the same trend
yeah same tree we have a new sharp for
the 2080 in 2080 okay this is considered
two and a half slot I believe tale it's
two point seven slots Kyle
no only no this is two point seven this
is yes well then it's slightly different
then oh well then this is two point five
oh nevermind oh it's two pi 5 so maybe
it's the same strap it on the heatsink
no no what is two point seven for the
r-tx not like those massive two point
seven five slot
there's 2.7 well you know what's weird
is that the Strix is 2.5 but the duel is
2.7 oh yeah you guys are at the DVI part
DVI port gives it away say again well
yeah the duel is actually thicker it's
2.70
versus 2.5 on the Strix so it like I
feel like it doesn't matter I mean you
give them a little bit 2.5 and 2.7 I
appreciate having a bit of space there
because if you're gonna do two way and
you have triple slot spacing then you
want to have some space there but two
ways not supported on 2070 so maybe
that's there that's why it's okay to
have a little bit who care the card yeah
that's what I'm taking again that thick
card yeah but you know what's
interesting is that if you scroll down
also the article points out another
oddity here is that there's a an envy
link SLI bridge or a finger on the dual
card and that's is there is it that is
there yeah these are renders no no but
it I I know I'm just saying these are
renders so I'm like right here looking
at it it looks like it's just a dummy
like part of the PCB that they didn't
actually fill up because there's another
contact points on it but I render so I'm
not sure they may not have soldered the
contact points on there yeah but what
they're saying is that they that Asus
likely borrowed over like the surplus of
unused PCBs for their r-tx 20 18 20 atti
oh yeah for these cards that way they'd
be compatible with the the cooler and
the backplate design and they just
didn't bother to fully remove that that
SLI finger just to make it simpler less
less money and stuff happens so don't
get excited it's not some Easter Egg
that in video is you know trying to slip
one under our under our noses or
anything you can't to a 27 TS
I don't think you'll ever be able to
two-way a 70 card from Nvidia ever again
actually doesn't seem like that's the
direction they're headed but you never
know and that's it you can expect both
of these cards to arrive sometime in
October yeah let's move on hey news
let's just talk about some general
boring non green news now how about that
news okay let's talk about red news know
that changing it up what color is Tesla
this Tesla considered I guess red is I
think regularly
usually what they alright so I guess
this could be read news at least this
article the Tesla Model 3 is now in
delivery logistics hell according to the
article and also according to you I musk
so production of the model 3 finally
ramped up to Musk's expectation of
producing 5000 a week but now they have
a logistics nightmare and there's it
doesn't really go into detail why but
for whatever reason these things cannot
get delivered at the moment some lady on
in on Twitter was bitching say in my car
I see picture I keep getting messages of
my car that's just sitting in the lot
waiting for shipment
but it's just been sitting there for
like a week or two and there's no
explanation they keep delaying my my
arrival day and I don't know why and
then Elon Musk reached out to her on
Twitter and said well we'll fix it soon
anyone must calm down I got this so this
is seem fairly relaxed in his Twitter
photo
he's always relaxed didn't like every
tweet must be from smoking that blood
right totally can't even trust a man who
are accusing people of being pedophiles
who's who's on the perpetual yeah he's
getting them next step so you should
just climb that fence I mean there's a
bit of bar boy I feel like she should
just take her car she paid for it yeah
yeah and the model 3 will basically just
drive her out of there yeah she wouldn't
have to drive it say model 3 you know
use the lasers I assume are built into
the front of you to cut through the
fence fly and then take me to in and out
to jump over the fence yeah so there's
there's bigger news though with with
Tesla lately as most of us know Elon
Musk tweeted that he wanted to take the
company private and then he sort of
assented funding secured not just
kidding no no and then he recanted a few
days later this whole situation kind of
revolved around his relationship with
the Saudi wealth fund who invested two
billion dollars into Tesla recently but
it's interesting it seems like Saudi
fund is is playing a different tune now
because today we learned that they
invested 1 billion dollars into Lucent
motors which is proud
the closest competitor to Tesla I can't
imagine they'd be that close cuz I've
never heard about them until today it's
a smack to the face to Elon Musk the
investment hopes to feel the production
of the Lucid air hypercar by 2020
the company had a hard time has had a
hard time finding financial support to
move it forward to actual vehicle
manufacturing so now they're gonna have
a new factory built in Arizona thanks to
that Saudi money that's that's nice
that's a t-money doesn't necessarily
mean that the Saudi fund has lost all
faith in Tesla or you lend must but
rather that they could just be
diversifying their their investments
like any smart investor would do with
their money I don't know I don't know
much about investing and it'll be I
thought you had like a contact at the
Saudi wells funds that was feeding you
information about their future plans
well you know they did invest a billion
dollars in the bit whit but say I spent
it all actually while spent at all he
needed he needed new clothes even while
these expensive tastes
and then lucid is is a suddenly now a
bigger much bigger threat to Tesla
because they actually have funding to
move forward in big ways like actually
making a product but it'll still be a
long way until they even get close to
catching up of Tesla because right now
their focus is on a 900 horsepower hyper
car that which is that look I think
that's it
who says lucid on the front so yeah it's
gotta be it which is definitely not a
mainstream product like Tesla's Model 3
so I mean its mainstream if you price it
right yeah how many horses 90 cent 900
900 uh reasonable faster than like a
Lambo like a just like a commuter car
yeah you got to get there quick you know
you like to work not anymore
this is a you stir egg right here
Tuesday November 28th Oh probably when
they're dropping this car oh you might
be wrong it's my guess or that car can
time travel and it's actually taken from
the future this is the 900 horsepower is
so fast to power the flux capacitor
capacitor and
in place of mr. fusion which has not
been invented yet mr. fusion is that is
that the name of that is that for the
movie yeah well in fact future
well actually the end of back to future
one that comes back from the future and
see he's he's a fusion miss mr. fusion
installed and the DeLorean remember that
so that he doesn't need the plutonium
anymore okay to power it you can even
just use it's like banana peel and stuff
like that and there he's the fusion
depart that's why I'm back to the Future
3 his problems in order to get back to
1985 isn't that he doesn't have enough
power like he doesn't need to find
plutonium he has mr. fusion the problem
is that he'd ripped the fuel line and he
just you can't run the engines to speed
the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour in
order to actually travel back to the
future
it's common sense really yeah the more
you know it's fun fun facts from Paul
there should be a whole segment where
you just drop like useless movie trivia
but I never I never know when I'm
actually gonna be able to like dole out
that information much information that's
a bit I had no idea that I knew that
much you never know until you test
yourself right yeah but it was all very
apparent that was beautiful alright so
so that's that cool good job there good
luck Tesla try not to lose all your
money and stuff that you don't have
let's move on to a PC perspective
article about Apple Apple further
further in for confirming that Apple
devices are not invincible
they are just as prone it's an
unappealing photo on a polling nope that
doesn't work yes Apple fans are upset
about the invulnerability of the
companies of some of the company's
products lately there was a less serious
bug that crashes the device or the
vulnerability the vulnerability sorry
when in vulnerabilities
yes no that would be that's what this
that's what they sell you that is true
and it's incorrect vulnerability right
fault what serious bug has been crashing
devices left and right from simply
visiting a web page which has been more
of an inconvenience than a threat but
still if your device is crashing from
opening up a web page that's that's kind
of yeah yeah it's kind of lame or
Windows doesn't do that alright so the
second vulnerability involves
SecureAnywhere which is a security
software a security software okay so go
on there's a vulnerability in his
security software which is kind of funny
ah um which has remained unpatched for a
while the patch was released months ago
but we're just learning about it this
week
why well the I guess the theory there
from Apple is that if you let people
know that there was an issue right away
it might expose more devices to the
threat but that could backfire as well
leaving users in the dark on something
like that could lead to a delayed
upgrade as usually as users wait to see
if a patch has negative negative effects
which leaves them open to attack in this
case the vulnerability was only
effective on already compromised devices
so hopefully the number of people
targeted was at a minimum so this is all
to say that Mac users stay woke I just
felt like saying that wanted to feel
what it's like to be young safe hip
fries I never said stay woke up before
not organically that is not as naturally
and fluidly as I just did it felt like
it didn't feel a little too forced
maybe after I said what I did right
after it seemed a bit more forced but I
don't know I did I use it properly then
I believe so I think I'm not I'm not
privy to these sorts of things okay
usually have to look it up on urban
dictionary interesting yes I know I'm
old when are you going to earn me do
Connery for like not to like when I was
younger I'd go to urban dictionary to
like create words and definitions oh you
would make them up
so yeah you've coined terms like yeah
terms like intranet eclis I don't know
we're like DJ nor something like that
you've made up the word dee Jen no I
didn't make it up huh but it's just like
we did the definition yeah urban
dictionary right which is basically like
you've been yeah made the word of the
same same thing but now now that I'm old
I go there two beats to stay informed of
the hip lingo that young uns are using
so anyway cuz they will custody woke her
next articles from over Clark 3d and
it's about Eric's Vegas 64 cutting
prices at least in the UK I check the
USA versus u.s. prices are the same u.s.
prices are the same right now but if
you're in the UK you're in luck because
they just dropped the pricing of the RX
Vegas 64 to be pretty much under the GTX
1084 in 40 pounds which converts to I
believe roughly five thousand US dollars
well is that true dolls totally like not
Yanni Kyle oh God your live show no I
know there was more Pierre's a stage
John spec news um okay so it's cheaper
now than a GTX 1080 if you live in the
UK which makes sense because it doesn't
perform wide on par with the GTX 280 in
most games like I will say but you get
three but you get three free games with
the RX Vega 64 right now through a suite
AMD promotion called
makes the game raise raise raise raise
the effing game refers it includes
strange Brigade star control origins and
Assassin's Creed origins Wow they could
have had an origins trifecta I know for
gate Brigade only added orange of
strange Brigade origins that sounds fun
yeah this should change the name of that
game strange origins Brigade line up
with this bundle
yeah alright missed opportunity there if
you're interested in those games and
that's a pretty cool thing to go along
with your Vegas 64 for number 140
British pounds how much cheaper would an
RX mega64 have to be than 1080
for you to buy it I feel like if you can
get a vague at 56 for less than 400
bucks yeah be a it would be a very
competitive offer like I don't know if
they can reasonably sell it for that
much just when it comes to the cost for
everything right being memory but like
because then you then like if you have a
competitive AMD graphics card with
Nvidia at the same price then you can
start talking about free sync versus
g-sync yeah because you really want free
sync or g-sync
in either case do you think free syncs a
lot cheaper if when it comes to the
monitors but yeah if the graphics cards
aren't like reasonably priced then right
it's fair to say but also the higher end
graphics cards is you're gonna have a
higher chance that the people who are
able to afford those cards are also
gonna be looking at something like a
higher in monitor that has g-sync
refreezing so great
I could see yeah I could see because you
know free sync is more friendly with
like monitor like manufacturers and
stuff we're like you'll see Samsung or
LG just pumping out monitors that just
happen to have free sync not as like a
primary feature but just like almost
like just a lot easier to implement than
G's across the manufacturer more big
right it's an open standard so I could
see someone who has an existing free
sync monitor at home and they you know
it might be worth it to spend an extra
40 50 bucks on a Vegas 64 for example
for that adaptive frustrate technology
or whatever but I would not say buy a
free sync monitor right now anticipating
future Radeon cards to come right
because if you had done that when they
first started talking about Vega you
would have been waiting for like a year
and a half or something
ya know just everything moveable next up
we have an article from a hot hardware
this is about Microsoft backpedaling on
they're obnoxious antiquer anti chrome
and anti Firefox pop-ups in Windows 10
so for the upcoming Windows 10 October
2018 update Microsoft was testing a new
prompt then basically would harass users
and convinced them to ditch their third
party
browser and instead try Microsoft edge
actually one of the actual texts read
you already have Microsoft edge or what
the prompt was gonna pop up anytime you
try to install a third-party browser
yeah and it would say you already have
Microsoft edge the safer faster browser
for Windows 10 which kind of rags on the
competitors security and and and their
speed at the same time which sounds
somewhat unfounded it's it's a little
unfair when Microsoft is making the
operating system um for them to be able
to do that with third-party applications
I don't mind them having edge and having
their own browser that they want to push
and but yeah this is this is lame so
they're not doing this anymore
no because they had some people test out
the build for their their windows
insider or whatever and then the
feedback was so negative that they
decided to exclude these warning
messages with the good with the future
update that ships next month thanks to
any of you guys watching this show who
are part of that in windows insider
program who gave them that feedback
sorry
unfortunately it's it's they're saying
that Microsoft may still try to test
these types of prompts in future updates
so just because it's off the Shelf now
it doesn't mean it couldn't come back at
some point I think Microsoft at this
point they haven't given up they're just
like all right how do we like rework
these pop-ups to be more sneaky and
they're just gonna try to like deceive
the testers and stuff and then they're
gonna roll it out eventually I think but
let's see what else the update will also
bring changes to edge the browser that
we just were suggesting people don't use
everything AI assist for the keyboard
HDR controls and other refinements to
the UI like bloody block that's exciting
um let's see that I think that's it for
my half possum yeah so that was about
half an hour or so just to look just
like we promised give or take and now
we're gonna switch gears don't go
anywhere
Paul's half starts in just a minute or
two will be very soon liked in the
comment in the description down below
yep thanks to you guys for watching this
at the thumbs up button doo doo
timestamps for me do timestamps for me
all
like we love time stamp makers and we'll
be right back
yes well well I didn't touch my beers
talking so much I know
