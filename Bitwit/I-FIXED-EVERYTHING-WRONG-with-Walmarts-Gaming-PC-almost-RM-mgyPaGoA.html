December 8th in Latin Paul from Paul's
hardware and myself we'll be doing our
annual charity livestream super exciting
it's fun a children and like last year
we're gonna be giving away 2 gaming pcs
on stream 2 to random people who are in
chat it's gonna be super nuts and I
thought what a great opportunity for me
to get rid of the Walmart overpowered
gaming PC that I purchased not so long
ago and recently did a video on which
you should check out if you haven't yet
and then I think to myself what a
wonderful world no that's not it and I
thought no I can't do that
there's too many shortcomings and
various limitations of this rig to
really make it a compelling giveaway
price and I want it to be good you know
for the children so today I'm gonna walk
you through the steps I took to improve
upgrade and even modify the system to be
a thousand times better than it was the
day I took it out of the box for the
children the thermal take a 500 aluminum
TG mid-tower features a sleek aluminum
front panel and two four millimeter
tempered glass panels for breathtaking
views enjoy 420 + 360 rad support at the
front and top respectively and breeze
through installation with the dismantle
of all modular design step up to your
case game with the a500 aluminum TG and
click on the link below for more info
now quick disclaimer this is not an
episode of pimp my rig alright we don't
care I don't care how the system looks I
wasn't trying to go for aesthetics it
would have been really easy for me to go
in here make everything all matching at
you throwing some sleeve cables and
stuff like that but that's not what
we're after we're trying to make the rig
way more functional and we're also
trying to make it way more thermally
sound due to that super air restrictive
front panel which as you can see we've
actually widened the gap quite a bit and
I'll show you how we did that later on
but a quick refresher of the original
specs here this is Walmart's overpowered
DTW one model featuring a core i7 8700 a
gigabyte h3 10 ms2 motherboard 16 gigs
of adata ddr4 2,400 speed memory a
gigabyte win for SOSI gtx 1070 a 256 gig
a data SSD 2 terabyte Toshiba hard drive
and a 550 watt great wall power supply
with that said the first rule of order
was to gut the system entirely and swap
out the motherboard because the h3 10
chipset while it's cheap for supporting
8th gen cpus is
just super basic and very very limited
for instance you only get one dim
4-channel which blows any chance of you
running dual channel memory you also
have a significantly cut down number of
PCIe and high-speed IO lanes you have
fewer USB ports not to mention you have
zero support for USB 3.1 gen2 and the
list kind of goes on enta the MSI B 360
gaming Pro carbon the B 360 chipset
pretty much remedies all of the h3 ten
limitations I just rattled off Plus this
board gets MDOT to support and a second
full-size PCIe by 16 slot share you
still can't overclock if you were to
drop the case queue CPU and here down
the line but you get a lot more
connectivity a far superior rear i/o and
a much higher quality board overall now
since we're just upgrading certain
things there are a lot of parts that I
kept such as the 8700 CPU the CPU cooler
and the single stick of 16 gigabyte ddr4
Ram I'm keeping the RAM single channel
for now because it's an easy upgrade
down the line for whoever wins this
thing and also single channel doesn't
really hurt your gaming performance all
that much the CPU cooler while let's
face it
yeah basics it's actually more than
capable of handling the 8700
temperatures especially with our front
panel mod which we'll touch on in a
moment moving on though you bet your
bottom dollar I swapped out that great
wall power supply it was arguably the
weakest link of the entire system and
there's absolutely no way I'm gonna ship
that out to a fan happily taking its
place is a 520 watt see Sonic s12 -
which is not modular it's kind of sucks
but it is 80 plus gold certified and
received an amazing review on Johnny
guru plus I got it on new egg while it
was on sale for Black Friday for just 39
bucks it was actually the only thing I
bought on Black Friday and I bought it
for you well one of you the rest of you
get nothing
overall the C sonic power supply is more
reliable more power efficient and gives
me the peace of mind that my system will
not set my house ablaze now there was
really no point in swapping out the
storage drives I think the SSD and the
mechanical drive that we have in here
while they are fairly basic are totally
fine for most users needs and the gtx
1070 like I keep saying is one of the
strongest parts in the original system
so we're keeping that - which brings us
to the mods now there are three things
that are so wrong with this case that I
felt modifications were necessary first
no USB 3.0 on the front panel nut you
gotta have USB 3 on the front man it's
2018 what are you doing so brace
yourself for my super ghetto solution I
am NOT a professional mutter in case you
didn't know I took a 20 pin USB 3
no adapter to type a and then I ran from
that type a connection a USB 3.0
extension cable and with the front panel
of the case removed
I ran the end of that cable to the front
of the case and cinched it down with
some zip ties and adhesive velcro which
actually worked out pretty well it seems
very secure now the solution actually
works like a charm but it does take up
the only USB 3 header on our motherboard
which meant I had to remove the PCI card
which had a USB 3.0 type C port coming
out the back it's totally fine with me
though because our new motherboard has
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c already built in
take that the second big issue with this
case is that there's no dust filtration
at the front so I thought this is a
quick and easy fix I went on Amazon I
bought a 280 millimeter magnetic dust
filter which actually fit over our three
120 millimeter fans very nicely I had to
make a little cut on the corner of the
dust filter though to make room for our
new front panel USB 3 port but then I
quickly realized after turning the
system on that the dust filter was too
close to the fan blades and the suction
force of the fans was actually drawing
the dust filter up against the fan
blades that was making this awful
rubbing noise it was terrible
not knowing how to proceed I kind of
just tossed the dust filter aside and
gave up so still no front dust filter
was just fine totally fine I'm sure you
guys have a million ideas of how I could
have made that work in the comments but
that brings us to the third and final
big no-no of this case which is the air
restrictive front panel Steve from
gamers Nexus actually did a thermal test
in this exact same case and found a 30
degree difference by simply removing the
front panel I'll put a link to his video
in the description if you want to check
it out but what makes this front panel
out of the box so ridiculously air
constrictive is that it's only giving
about 4 or 5 milliliters of space
between the fans and the front panel
itself these fans just don't have the
static pressure to intake any air from
that limited gap to make matters worse
the tempered glass side panel actually
extends past the frame of the case which
completely cuts off any ventilation on
this left side of the chassis the way
the front panel mounts to the chassis is
actually pretty simple it's got four
screws one two three four two on either
side that mount from the inside of the
case and they pretty much just screw
into the mounting holes on the front
panel itself now the screws themselves
are really really short and that's why
there's such a short distance between so
I basically ditched those screws
entirely but longer three and a quarter
inch screws found a couple nylon washers
and spacers lying around and with those
simple elements I was able to get the
front panel a full three-quarters of an
inch away from
fans which brings in a lot more air and
keeps the CPU much cooler now you'll be
very mad at me to know that I didn't do
anything testing of the original system
with the new setup that we have here
we're actually seeing some really good
CPU temperatures only hitting 64 see on
the package at its hottest and that was
after 15 minutes of GTA 5 at 1440p the
GPU is doing great also hitting 61 C at
its hottest under that same load based
on Steve's findings I would have to
assume that the thermal situation here
is infinitely better than it would have
been right out of the box so in that
sense mission complete
you know I feel like I've spent a lot of
time with this rig ever since I brought
him into this world I've decided to him
and you know I feel like as a proud PC
parent I've helped him grow and become
the rig that he is today and as a proud
PC parent I can I can confidently say
that he is ready to fly the coop and
maybe one day he'll meet a nice admin
who makes him feel special whoo-hoo
he'll fall in love with which won't
happen because he's a computer but
anyway if you would like to win this
computer we're doing a live stream for
charity on December 8 so stay tuned for
more information on that you can follow
me on twitter at bit wit Kyle apart from
that guys let me know what you think of
the various changes that I've made to
this system I know a lot of these mods
and stuff are super ghetto fabulous but
hey I would much rather have the system
in its current state then the way it was
so you guys let me know if you agree
toss a Luke on this video if you enjoyed
it and get subscribed for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon have a
good one guys
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
