probably wondering where my 9900 k
review was this morning if you're
watching this at the time of upload
because that's when the embargo lifted
for all the performance reviews for that
CPU long story short there was some
miscommunication between me and Intel
and it resulted in me not getting the
sample until this morning several hours
after the embargo lifted it was really
no one's fault it was just a
miscommunication it is what it is but
the upshot here is that today you get a
slightly different kind of 99 hundred K
video from me
instead of just you know your standard
graphs and benchmarks and things which a
lot of other reviewers have already done
you should check them out as well I'm
gonna just do sort of a let's play and
give you guys a real-world example of
how the 99 hundred K performs
specifically when paired with a beast of
a setup including to RTX 20 80 TI
founder's additions in SLI you can see
I've got a custom loop set up for our 99
hundred K which is currently overclocked
to 5 gigahertz at one point three five
volts we've got a pump res combo and we
have a single 240 millimeter rad with
the most ghetto fan rig ever I know I
have radiator fan screws somewhere
around here but I just I don't wanna
spend the time to find in there
somewhere around so I just duct-taped it
never do this please this is just for
because I'm lazy and this is for a video
you can see the radiator we have this
fairly thick and moving back to the
graphics cards I have overclocked these
guys 32 gigs of g-scale treadin z ddr4
3200 speed and that's all on top of an
asus prime z 390 a motherboard so that
is our test setup and like I said we're
gonna play a couple games I have three
titles picked out apart from that we're
gonna keep it super cache and I'll have
a framerate counter in the corner of the
screen so you can monitor the
performance throughout the entire video
and just sort of see what this
ridiculous system is capable of sound
good
let's get to it alright shadow of the
Tomb Raider here we go this is the very
beginning of the game I have never
played this before so prepare to cringe
and it looks like I can probably take
this guy down
Fu oho the reason why our framerate is
pretty low is because this game while it
does support SOI for whatever reason
it's really not utilizing the second
card much I think we're at what is it
18% GPU load on the second card right
now we're at full 100% on the first card
but it doesn't seem to be leveraging the
second card much so that kind of
explains the underwhelming frame rate
that you see there so I'm probably not
gonna play this game much longer and
we'll just
kind of move on to the second one pretty
quickly here because I really want to
showcase the horsepower in this system
and right now this game isn't really
doing it justice mmm I love cold cement
it's my favorite oh my god there's more
over here okay so I got a like I got I
got a run jump is that what's going on
here
oh geez yep that's it okay totally got
this oh yeah oh no no no no hit get back
up come on I just bought these clothes I
don't wanna get him wet Oh mushrooms ha
this game's gonna get a lot more
interesting go oh god that was a big-ass
penis what was that okay I feel like I'm
gonna die soon if I don't get air airs
good oxygen okay I'm mashing Iman after
they really keep you on your toes in
this game alright so you guys can see
that we've been hovering around 50 60
FPS this whole time at least in this
environment who's to say what what it
would be like if we were more outdoors
in the jungle or during the daytime
something like that or in a building but
oh okay
I think that's that means it's time to
move on to the next game alright GTA 5
let's do this
now we're using very high settings
across the board maxing out pretty much
everything and this game certainly takes
more advantage of SLI than Shadow the
Tomb Raider does we can see that we are
95 to 96 percent load on both of our RT
x 20 ATT eyes and the frame rate is
haulin I need a 4k getting around 120 to
140 fps and GTA 5 at these settings is
pretty nice getting about 100 FPS rolled
through the streets now it does dip down
to the 80s occasionally still feels
really smooth though surprisingly no
micro stuttering from what I can tell
where I was experiencing that I think on
an older driver one of the first drivers
it might have been launched a driver I'm
not sure I'm sorry you guys have to
watch me play through a camera I would
have loved to just give you a much
cleaner OBS screencap or something like
that but that does tank performance
actually in shadow the Tomb Raider we
got a hundred FPS on average when we
weren't recording and eighty-three FPS
on average when we were so literally 83%
of the performance when you're when
you're doing a screencap and I wanted to
show the system at its absolute best so
you will please forgive having to watch
me through a camera all right let's call
some trouble here
which is never too hard to do in GTA 5
in case you're curious the custom loop
is keeping our 9900 Kay fairly cool at
50 around 50 to 55 degrees C I'm sure
the solder Tim is also helping those
thermal state to a minimum which is
pretty nice right I'm entering a Chico
here because I don't want to die
I don't know dime camera it's just
embarrassing and our GPUs it looks like
the bottom card is getting up to about
66 C and the top card is obviously gonna
be a bit hotter at 83 it's kind of
maxing out at 84 see right now I always
love watching the framerate tank as soon
as I make an explosion happen on screen
all right let's get the physics going in
here let's do it yeah my boys still
getting like a hundred FPS here I see no
problem sir
oh I am no longer invincible and I open
probably gonna die right now or not oh
hey okay all right and it's time to move
on to the next game rounding out with
some battlefield one and I have spawned
inside up a tank it looks like it's on
fire I should probably get out
I'll buy no stay back in the tank I
don't know what do I do you go bro oh
jeez yep
I'm following you oh I'm gonna hide
behind your body that didn't work really
showed them didn't we got one that's
probably the only kill you'll see me
make this entire game oh oh that's a
smoke grenade why am i running towards
it no bear in mind this is multiplayer
we are playing online so Internet
bandwidth and all that does factor in to
some degree to whatever performance
we're seeing right now
I'm going behind a tree you'll never
find me oh they found me getting about a
hundred sixty frames per second behind
this tree it's awesome
haha killed you with blazing fast frame
rates run come on oh geez
nope nope nope nope nope nope still
swimming still swimming get out of the
water dude come on
so fYI we're at 63 see right now on the
ninety nine hundred K and GPU still
looking like around 85 86 see right now
getting kind of toasty so I would say
we're averaging overall anywhere from
150 to 160 FPS thereabouts so it's
actually really good
ultra preset of a1 at 4k so yep alright
guys so there it is the fastest gaming
PC in the world
technically what do you guys think I
mean who needs this kind of performance
probably people with endless budgets and
just just money falling out of there but
this is easily a $3,000 setup I can't
justify the 9900 K for 530 plus dollars
even though it is a hell of a lot faster
than the Rison 720 700 X as we've seen
in a lot of review so far I mean it is
the new fastest gaming CPU on the market
stealing the title from the 8700 K that
being said at its current price it is a
tough sell and you get a much better
bang for the buck there's a whole lot
more value packed into the Rison 720 700
X so do not overlook that chip if you're
just looking to build a sweet gaming PC
but this is just kind of for the walls
once again
so hopefully you enjoyed seeing those
astronomical frame rates again at 4k
pretty much max settings across the
board and all the titles that we tested
you guys let me know what you think in
the comments below about this ridiculous
setup and the 9900 K specifically thanks
so much for watching guys toss a like on
the video if you enjoyed it get
subscribe for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon and i'll see you all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
