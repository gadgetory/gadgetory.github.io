Radley enly this is the PCO 11 dynamic
excel in beautiful fuzzy okay it's a
sharp down so they actually made it
bigger in pretty much every way shape
and form so it's a deeper taller and
wider but they've crammed a lot more
functionality into it which is awesome I
think should have a finish built here
and the empty shell here let's take it
out let's take a look at the empty show
okay so for starters you can see that
the motherboard tray is quite a bit
bigger we can go ei TX all the way and
so the ATX will actually go pretty much
flush with with this grommet right here
so it doesn't overhang the actual
motherboard tray and you still have room
throughout your cables where it bends so
that's actually pretty nice that's the
first kind of major improvement the
other thing is what if what if you are
just relying on airflow from the bottom
here and you don't plan to mount any
fans on the side well they've actually
considered that so they've actually put
one two three SSD trays here so two and
a half inch drive mounts which you can
obviously fill this up with whatever
crazy RGB arrangement you want and these
are all modular you can pop them off if
you want as well you can also remove one
of these for a 120 millimeter fan so you
could just you know duct us out with a
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator if you wanted to there's also a
plate at the bottom here to cover it up
give it a cleaner look you can swap this
around to you can have that plate go at
the top and have the three SSDs at the
bottom or you can just do a sort of mix
and match whatever your heart's content
the bottom here is really nice they
actually have a removable plate so that
you can actually mount your your fans in
a radiator to first outside of the case
before mounting it all inside this is
actually a huge improvement compared to
having to just screw the fans in or
radiators in from the actual outside of
the case where he actually had to tilt
the chassis and it was it was kind of
but so that's been much improved as well
there's a hundred 20 millimeter fan noun
still at the back of the case here's a
look at the back of the case you can see
we have more mounting options here this
is a plate that comes off just like that
where you can see we actually have a hot
swap sort of like pre-configured wiring
here for for your your drives which go
in from the back of the case filled just
like the original P Co 11 more storage
options here power supply goes to the
bottom still and here's a look at those
SSD panels that are now on the side of
the case this is gonna retail for 199
which is quite a bit more than the I
believe 139 for the PCO 11 dynamic non
XL however you are getting more
functionality built in and oh I should
also mention that this is good reminder
you can actually mount these SSD plates
that were on the side here to the bottom
of the case as well so we're going to
show them off in a variety of different
positions you have that option available
to you
so that's the PCO 11 dynamic excel let's
see what else they got here this is the
Odyssey X this is a very interesting
concept because if you look at this case
in this case they're actually the same
case but in different configurations so
this one's kind of more of a horizontal
where you can see that we've got this
little cut in the glass it's actually
separate it actually opens up two ways
it's kind of like two folding barn doors
whereas this one is vertical so cut
right down the middle I mean have your
choice of either or I guess when it
ships it's gonna come completely flat in
the Box all these pieces will require
full assembly so the user can determine
at that point which way they want to go
giving you flexibility and multitude of
forms not usually seen on computer cases
we also have this kind of cool little
design here on the front panel for
example you've got a big gap for for air
flow potentially coming in but if you
wanted to you could actually swap this
around and have the airflow come from
the sides the the middle will be
completely closed off at that point but
you'll have more openings on either side
of the case it'll be interesting to see
which configuration and front panel
works the best I would imagine this is
probably the worst you've probably worse
off having it from the middle since this
is where the fan hub will be and you'll
be still covering the blades for the
most part
who's to say until the reviews come out
there's obviously a lot of flexibility
here this especially being a relatively
large chassis you can see in this
configuration they actually have a
radiator at the front a 360 rad it looks
like as well as another one at the top
whereas over here maybe you could do
something like three fans on the side
and have another radiator at the top
there so a lot of options to play around
with I think this is the more
interesting configuration of the two
with the with the glass barn doors
mounted vertically simply because you
actually get to see the the hinges in
action
there are hinges on this panel it's very
interesting and it also kind of creates
this gap here so becomes a little bit
more open air obviously no dust
filtration there so that might be a
concern for some users but certainly a
unique look that's gonna cost you a
pretty penny right now Lee and Lee is
estimating I believe anywhere from three
to four hundred dollars which is
relatively steep it'll be interesting to
see how many people actually pick one of
these up look at these feet these case
we are huge you know what they say about
cases the big feet this is the land cool
too this is probably the case here that
I'm most excited about because of the
price point $89 which is kind of unheard
of for Lindley they're really trying to
attack the mainstream market here and go
after a lot of their competitors that
have cases in this price range look at
this power supply shroud is external
it's like an external power supply
shroud that actually folds down from the
left side this is this is huge I wish
more cases would start doing this it
actually allows you to access your your
in your drive cages where you've got
three slots right there you can access
your power supply you know what happens
to me often times is I'll actually
install the power supply in a case that
has a power supply basement and then
forget to have plugged in one of the the
power supply cables but the connector
for it is way off to this side and I'm
just like trying to fish for it on the
other side of the case if only there was
a way you could fold it down this is
actually really handy I think it's gonna
help out a lot of builders who are in
tight situations the side panel is on
hinges very nice opens very seamlessly
and inside we actually have a very
well-thought-out interior of course you
got it looks like 140 millimeter fan
mount right there it looks like you
could go up to e ATX motherboards here
because if you look at this guy so I
think by default
it's like this right kinda like this so
if you have an ATX motherboard the
cables will just route right in here
kind of very cleanly however if you're
stepping up to e ATX turn this around
and that gives you probably about a good
inch maybe an inch and a half more
clearance for your motherboard so that
the cables are still routed very cleanly
kind of like that you have some cable
cutouts right here a couple fan mounts
for 120 millimeter fans going straight
up to your GPUs tons of ventilation here
so assuming that your power supply is
gonna be conflicting with this I'm not
exactly sure how that's gonna work
maybe this fan would be a bit more
effective at actually getting fresh
intake from the bottom of the case but
yeah that should definitely help your
GPU thermals out it looks like a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
could be mounted at the front of the
case and the top it looks like you have
room for a 240 okay one thing I forgot
to mention here on the power supply
shroud they actually have ventilation
slots on the side which is going to help
for air flow with these top fans or with
the fans that are mounted on top of the
the actual shroud which is a very nice
nice feature on the backside the power
supply shroud comes down this way as
well you do get a mounting tray for two
and a half inch SSDs it looks like you
might be able to fit a three and a half
inch drive there tooth don't don't don't
quote me on that there's an optional
hot-swap board that already has the
connectors wired up so that you can
pretty much hot swap any drives that are
on the opposite side which is pretty
cool again sold separately it's gonna be
optional no word on pricing of course we
also have a tempered glass panel that
swings out just the same way as it does
on the other side to reveal a very clean
looking backside - SSD trays right here
a single single thumb screw and these
two large panels covering up the
majority of your cables if you remove
this guy right here it'll actually
reveal a little mounting plate that
would be ideal for mounting OOP there is
a thumb screw would be ideal for
mounting say like an RGB controller
which I believe this case comes included
with or a fan hub for example if you
wanted to mount one here it just keeps
things really tidy especially with all
the cables that that are usually wired
up to those devices all under one
seamless panel that's pretty cool this
panel is held in by a single thumb screw
which I've just removed and if you take
that off you can see sort of our front
panel connectors just running down
seamlessly of course the the plate that
I showed you earlier on the other side
is going to be here so you won't be able
to see any of this
garbage seems like a pretty clean and
seamless cable management system of
course you still have room down below
the power supply tray to stuff your
excess cables into I've saved the front
panel for last okay there's addressable
RGB under here which I'll get some
b-roll of that you kind of see it over
there but let me go ahead and pop this
off it comes off very easily if my wife
will take that thank you honey
so this is actually really cool there's
this removable mount as a removable
mounting bracket where you can house
again three 120 or three 140 millimeter
fans but what's cool about it is that
you can see that it if I can take this
out aha okay kind of comes out like this
okay so it comes out like this right so
it's got these little notches on the
corner that you can actually slot in to
either the grooves that are down below
or slightly up so you can see that
there's depending on what you slotted
into it'll affect how this radiator
bracket is installed so for example if
we do it right here you can see that the
brackets actually indented a little bit
so if you want to move the fans further
away from the front panel to get
additional airflow in to widen that gap
that's that's obviously an option to you
that's gonna be favorable for a lot of
users however if you want to flip this
around and slop the pegs into the lower
grooves you can see that the bracket is
now actually protruding slightly from
this front piece of the frame which is
actually going to give you more radiator
support so you can actually fit thicker
radiators in here obviously the fans are
gonna be brought closer to the front
panel but there's a sacrifice you'll
have to decide for yourself
it's also worth pointing out here that
the front panel gets its addressable RGB
through this little connector here these
little metallic pegs on these metallic
contacts straight up here very similar
to what we've seen on like a fan Tech's
case for example on the end to evolve so
this is the land cool - $89 I think
that's a very attractive price point
especially for layin lead cases I think
a lot of people are going to be
attracted to it because of its
flexibility and the crazy amount of
thought that's been put into the design
and there we have what's chalking up to
be one of my favorite new lammle cases
