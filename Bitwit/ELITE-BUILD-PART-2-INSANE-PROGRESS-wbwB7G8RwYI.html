the link in the description to learn
more what's going on guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well today
is the long-awaited part 2 of the enthu
elite build our 10000 ish dollar system
that we're gonna be building from the
ground up there have been some changes
since part 1 many things have transpired
so before we dive into the actual build
section because we're actually
installing things in the case today I
wanted to quickly go over what has
changed since part 1 for starters a lot
of you guys were telling me to deal it'd
that core I 9 79 80 X II or you would do
terrible things to me so help against my
will I decided to turn this in to the
folks over at gamers Nexus gamers Nexus
Steve actually did a fantastic job
deleting this guy and applying some
liquid metal himself in order to lower
our thermals and increase power
efficiency and other good things like
that so I can't wait to actually get
this thing installed and take it for a
spin especially with this ridiculous
custom loop that we're building around
it it should be pretty exciting but
during his testing and you guys should
definitely go and check out his video
I'll put a link in the description below
that he did with the rampage 6 extreme
motherboard and this particular CPU he
found that that motherboard was actually
throttling the core frequency due to an
overheating vrm so because of that and
Steve's infinite wisdom I've decided to
invest in an asus rog rampage 6 extreme
mono block that will hopefully lower the
temperatures on our BRM enough so we
don't encounter any thermal throttling
because the last thing we want is for
this thing to be super nice and deleted
and all that and get ruined at the end
of the day by the motherboard so
additionally I have since done away with
the single reservoir and loop idea we're
actually gonna be doing two loops so
I've actually got some new hardware here
the ekx res 140 Revo d5 RGB PWM pump res
combos we've got two of them one loop is
probably going to be for our CPU and the
other for our graphics
additionally about that I have one of
them installed we're still waiting on
the other GTX 1080p I from Asus we ran
into some ridiculous shipping mishaps
recently so it's actually on its way
long story short it will be here shortly
and I will be able to continue just fine
but everything's in order for that I'm
very excited to be doing a dual loop
system though for the first time
additionally you might notice this stack
of ll series RGB fans from Corsair we
have six one 20s and six one 40s with
their included commander Pro digital fan
and RGB lighting controllers those will
be situated on our four radiators here
and going with the dual loop
configuration we are gonna have two
radiators per loop so we're gonna have a
480 and a 360 for each of our loops
which is pretty insane covered by these
fantastic fans no pun intended
we've also got some new storage
situation here so we've got 2 m2 SSDs
these are both nvme we've got the 960
Evo these are both from Samsung this is
a 250 gig version or model that we're
gonna be using as a boot drive and then
we've got a 2 terabyte stick that's just
gonna be for our scratch disk and bigger
applications all of our raw footage and
things like that if we're gonna be
editing games and so forth I may invest
in a second 2 terabyte drive I think we
have enough lanes for for that to happen
so maybe we'll do some raid action that
may be pretty sweet this is an overkill
system after all and then finally we've
got the plateau max DF series power
supply from enter backs that I showed
off in part 1 but this is just a quick
verbal updates that we do have some
custom sleeved cables from Joey @n
sourced on the way they are in the mail
he's already done with them I'm not
gonna give too much away as far as the
pattern and colors that were using I
mean you can probably figure out that
it's gonna be more or less color neutral
but they are gonna be some really sweet
cables so I can't wait to show those off
as well but I want to start trying to
bend some tubes by the end of this part
1 or part 2 video so we got to get
everything installed radiators the fans
let's go ahead and do that now and see
how far we get it's gonna be intense
alright guys check out the progress
we've made looks pretty sweet things are
going pretty smoothly you can see that
we have very little clearance between
this rightmost pump rez and the radiator
like the fittings just like maybe a
millimeter away from the fin stack it's
just just by a hair and actually the the
back plate here for modular plate that
we mounted these pump presses - I
thought it supported two side by side
reservoirs but apparently it only has
the mounting strips for one of them so I
actually only have one side of this
reservoir mounted to that bracket you
can see here if we take a look at the
backside I actually had to zip-tie one
side to part of the bracket so it's kind
of ghetto rigged here and you can't even
tell from the other side it looks
perfectly fine it might be slightly
tilted but I can always tweak that a
little bit later but apart from that
everything is going pretty smoothly here
the fans and radiators are fitting just
fine had just you know just enough
clearance between this this radiator fan
and and the pump res there but yeah
looking good now after I set all this up
I spent a good hour and a half just
looking at this system trying to figure
out where my runs would go because
obviously we're dealing with two loops
now and it kind of makes things a little
bit more complicated but I think I
figured it out for the most part so I'm
gonna share with you guys my idea for
for each of these runs and we're gonna
get to tube bending so for for this pump
res I was thinking this would control
the the CPU loop this would be our CPU
loop right so and don't pay attention to
the fittings they're just here for
placeholders they don't necessarily
indicate the direction that the tubes
will be going so this is the outlet here
I was thinking I was gonna go out just
slightly over and then up and then go
straight across into the monoblock out
of the monoblock
and then we're gonna go diagonally back
into the corner of the case before going
straight up into this Inlet for the
radiator we're going to come down here
all the way down it's going to go back
and then into that back port then from
here it's gonna go up just ever so
slightly just barely above the fan
it's gonna go all the way to the end of
the fans straight back and then straight
back up to the inlet so that would be
our cpu loop now our GPU loops gonna be
a little tricky because it's gonna have
to avoid all of the runs from our CPU
loop it's gonna get kind of messy in
this area here but but hear me out we're
gonna go out then we're gonna go all the
way back and maybe I'll do some like
like a little bit of bendy magic going
straight into this Inlet here and then
it's gonna go to both of our GPUs and
it's gonna come out this guy another
boom it's gonna come out back here down
below maybe back into this inlet out
here in the end of there and then
finally returning from the the bottom
radiator bottom of the radiator into our
pump rest so that is the tentative plan
for now as far as the runs go and you
know I'm gonna try to be flexible if
something's not working out then I'm
totally willing to switch it up and it's
all about problem solving at this point
but on that note I think we are ready to
start bending some tubes however since I
am pretty much as noob as they come when
it comes to custom water cooling and to
bending I'm actually gonna call upon my
good friend Brian Stroh from bps Kustoms
you guys should go check his channel out
if you haven't yet tons of good stuff
there
reviews builds lots of custom work he
does a great job over there but Brian's
gonna help me out a little bit he's
gonna give me a couple pointers that
he's learned over his several years of
being a custom water cooling enthusiast
so that maybe I have a little bit easier
time figuring this all out as I go about
the end through elite builds and maybe
you guys will learn something too all
the while I'm gonna just go ahead and
jump into to bending so you guys have
some nice visuals to overlap on his sexy
ass voice without further ado guys let's
get bending what's going on guys my name
is Brian I run the bps Kustoms YouTube
channel I'm sure Kyle will drop a link
down there somewhere and if he doesn't
he's a jerk but I'm here with my very
wobbly table to give you guys some tips
and also some tricks as far as how to
approach your next water cooling project
now keep in mind that some of these
might seem like fairly basic techniques
however when it comes to something like
water cooling especially if you're doing
an overkill system like Kyle is right
now if you don't have the basics down
you're going to run into problems you're
not only
waste materials but you could end up
with a flooded box of electronics and
that's not good for anybody
first thing you need before you even
start is the right tools now you're
gonna need a heat gun preferably one
that stands up on its own so you don't
have to hold it while you're doing your
tubes second thing something to cut the
tube with the last thing you definitely
need if you're dealing with hardline is
one of these little silly so uh silicone
inserts because without this your tube
will collapse when you try to bend it
now another thing that I highly
recommend having on hand is something to
finish the ends of your tubing with now
what I mean by that is a lot of times
when you cut PE TG or acrylic you'll end
up with a not perfectly smooth edge or
even worse you could have a bur if you
insert that edge into a fitting you
could slice through the rubber o-ring
and cause a leak a lot of times when
people have leaks inside their system
it's not necessarily because that
fitting was bad from the factory rather
they damaged it during installation
there's a couple different ways you can
prevent this from happening you can buy
this from Home Depot this is called a
deep burrow deeper deeper it's about
three dollars you could do both the
inside and the outside of the tube with
this put the tube in and you just spin
it the best way that I found to smooth
out the edges of the tube however is
with this this is a primo shield rigid
finishing bit it fits into the end of a
drill you put it into the tube like this
and then you spin the drill you could
actually use this tool to make minor
adjustments in the length of the tube as
well as just smooth out the edges let's
get to bending what you want to do is
make sure your heat gun is on low or
medium heat high heat and any form will
cause this tube to blister so you don't
want to hold it too close you also don't
want to hold it too far away to make
sure that it's getting appropriately
heated keep it a couple inches off rock
it back and forth while spinning it like
a rotisserie if you're not rocking it
back and forth you're only heating one
spot in the tube and when you go to bend
it you don't kink so when everything is
all heated up the way you know that it's
ready to be bent is that the tube will
actually lose some structural integrity
and start to bend on its own bend the
tube slowly and with even pressure don't
rush it into place and when it's all
done when it's at the angle you want
take it off the heat and allow it to
cool naturally you could blow on it a
little bit don't dip it into water
that's a bad idea
keep in mind as PE TG or acrylic cools
because the material is contracting it
does tend to go back towards being
straight now
not gonna snap back into the straight
position however you might open up the
angle a little bit if you just leave it
and instead of a 90 you might end up
with like a hundred degree angle in
order to prevent that hold the tube in
place until it's cool for those of you
who are beginners or even intermediate
to benders something like this can
certainly help you out this is the
Barrow bending kit it comes in different
sizes this one I think actually is the
16 millimeter size and I'm dealing with
some 12 millimeter tubing here however
you get the idea you could actually bolt
these down to a piece of woods that you
have them affixed in place and you could
bend around them or you could just hold
a freehand they actually help you
tremendously when it comes to getting
precise angles on your bends because
they are all marked up to 180 degrees
the same thing applies to freehand
bending if you're using one of these
bending kits and you take your tube and
bend it around the corner you're gonna
need to make sure that you hold it there
because if you don't it'll actually
retract a little bit and you'll end up
with the wrong angle now the last thing
I want to talk about is measuring a lot
of people think that they could take a
straight piece of tube put a little mark
on it bend it at that mark and then
you're gonna have the perfect distance
between fittings it's not how it works
first of all if you put a mark on this
tube especially with something like a
sharpie when you heat the tube to bend
it you're actually gonna bake that
Sharpie right into the finish and not be
able to get it off the second thing is
that tube ends don't actually terminate
at the same point that you start the
bend this is because the middle of the
bend is actually pushed back about maybe
a half an inch or so from where that
final Bend comes down the thing you want
to do when you're measuring your tubing
runs is that say you have four inches
between fittings before you need to make
a 90-degree turn you don't want to
measure and Bend this tube at 4 inches
if you do that when you make the radial
Bend you're actually going to end up at
about 4 and a half 4 and 3/4 inches and
you're gonna be way too far this Bend
actually extends the tube and if you if
you look at it you actually want to
start bending up maybe three and a half
inches and then you'll end up at the
right spot this takes some getting used
to some practice and a lot of patience
alright guys so after much time effort
and patience we finally got some of the
runs done today as you can see all the
runs for our CPU loop are complete
it looks fantastic I think the only one
I would redo is this one right here so
maybe we can do away with these
extensions might make it look a little
bit cleaner but we still have the GPU
loop to do obviously we're still waiting
on that second GTX 1080i so once that
rolls in we'll be able to do that and
fill the loop finally and do a first
boot in part 3 hopefully I think it's
gonna happen so stay tuned for that
brian's advice came in handy a lot i
used pretty much every tip he gave me
and it was a lifesaver guys once again
check his channel out and thanks brian
for being a part of this video some of
my own experiences however were that if
you happen to cut down a run almost too
short so that it falls short of a
particular fitting if you have the
option to what helped us a lot
was actually sliding the radiators just
you know maybe it's only a centimeter or
two but that actually keeps you from
having to start a completely new run
wasting more materials and time so that
was a huge huge help now i also picked
up this angling tool from XS pc which
would have been real handy if it
actually fit the tubing we were using
that was my bad so what we ended up
having to do was improvising drawing
some flat lines 90-degree and 45 degree
lines on a piece of paper and measuring
the tubes or angling the tubes that way
which actually worked just fine and
especially since you're laying it flat
on the table it helps it just stay all
the more aligned when you're doing your
runs overall this has been a very
positive experience very challenging
obviously very rewarding when you get it
right compared to hot line this is a
completely different animal we're
dealing with two loops here that have to
be running side by side not interfering
and also looking good next to each other
so there's a lot more planning involved
much more detailed going into it so guys
thank you so much if you liked what you
saw go ahead and toss I like on the
video be sure to subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon you can also check me
