sure like a season right on max it's on
max Wow yeah I could turn some of the
lights down it's like is that the ISO
 it was that hot today here that's
fine sure yeah like I said my half is
gonna be a little bit shorter than yours
shake more beer
I think it could be the beer to get miss
worm no regions they got a drink a lot
of beer to keep warm because it's so
cold they do oh yeah it's really no
really cool that's probably it makes you
extra warm the Norwegian beer but we're
drinking beer to keep cool if it isn't
but today no no doctor doctor some won't
appreciate that sorry I don't know why
I'm doing you know this is the beginning
of your show you're right beginning of
your head yeah it's all about the hook
first impressions you got a hook hook a
man's gotta captivate you see Pikachu
just said this is the first time I came
on the stream I don't know if you meant
that suffered his first time viewing in
which case welcome thank you for being
here or the fridge sorry he was brought
to climax perhaps could also be another
way to interpret that Vietnamese bein
yeah oh my god I will never attempt that
beer check word reduced in chat yes I'm
drinking Norwegian Wood provided by our
good friend John who's gargling that
down your throat good friend John
Norwegian Wood that's a couple weeks ago
from Norway for the Fraxel day of
refinement this is really good actually
I'm enjoying it quite quite
significantly oh yeah
it is traditional Norwegian smoked eel
with juniper berries it's very smoky
cumin powder do you want to try it sure
you want to try mine even though you're
not a huge fan of IPAs it's not that's
not that abrasive get to ring the bell
ooh that's really good it is that's it's
way better than it tastes like wood but
it like in a good way
yeah in a good way smoky that's the most
woody beer I've ever had yours does not
taste like an IPA to me really I don't
know mmm maybe it's cuz of this one it
could be Bram's or I don't know we don't
know what kind of IPAs Chicago has been
making that's also tradition Chicago
style IPA they've been known to stuff
their up they they play by the beat
of their own music of their own hot dog
instruments
oh my god what we're being attacked I
had an ant infestation at the front of
my desk earlier this morning when I woke
up they were all behind my monitors and
they were like eating in my trash
can
I don't even eat in here and there was
like I don't know are they do they
like water coolant that is like liquid
fluids ever water cooling the ants are
here that means they found something
they found a food source because then
the way the ants work there's not to be
food though it's like a hive mind and
they send out the scout scout scout sup
I know he'll dance work and then the
scouts fun when they come back that is a
bunch of food over here let's go over
here over here Kevin gets come on the
gun and then they'll move on mass over
to that location so it's like so it's
like playing Civ you send out your
scouts and you know they've been - my
happen she's area that I left in your
trash you asshole you were eating Del
Taco here but that was that way after
the infestation anyway the ants
dicks concealed for the ants not having
any dicks out for the yank is not going
anywhere physically going out for the
ants but we are talking about natives
right did we already put our stores now
we didn't really quick plug I should
shout out to ourselves out there
ourselves stuff we are selling stuff we
were selling things Paul has his store
where he's selling shirts and mugs
bawls hardware done it yep shirts mugs
pint glasses all very high quality buy
during the show hoodie view eyeshadow at
the end hoodies - he's got it all babies
and I've got mine on bit wig tech slash
store which apparently still says
awesomesauce networks you can just
ignore that for now
um but all the is still the same
all this is all the shirts topic I'm the
worst when it comes to updating things
like that alittle say awesomesauce
network for the next year before I
finally like my image probably cried
creating some comes beautiful beauty
comes through shingle with the with the
rebranding in this yes but if you guys
happen to pick up anything from either
of our stores you will get a Johnson
shout out you'll get a double ring from
the ring mug that Steve gave me yeah if
you happen to pick up something from
both of our stores during this live
stream we will give you a loud and proud
Johnson shout this way so um thank you
very much Zach for the donation $5 hey
let me show cowbow I've got a core i3
6100 and am looking to upgrade i've
already got z170 so I'm looking to go on
watch should I go core i5 6600 K or wait
for heavy Lake KB like a baby lake as
we've learned in winter show um actually
the i3 6100 I like this one makes an
article with z170 I feel like it's a
nice upgrade path so I'm glad that
you've been using it and that you're
looking upgrade that's said you can't
about that 6100 for very long I'd say
wait for kb lake yeah but bear in mind
the kb lakes probably not out until q1
next year January February March so if
you can't wait that long if you're like
no I'm running in the bottlenecks right
now like I'm trying to play battlefield
1 or something that's really CPU
intensive or something like that and
it's holding me back then yeah go for
the 6600 K but if you can wait if it's
holding you over for dads I wait for K
be like yeah yeah I would agree what's
wrong to our first story of today new my
half fear which is that tech news stuff
it's about AMD launching their seventh
generation ap use for the desktop as
well as the m4 platform this is now
official to bringing excavator AP use 2
to desktop users
but you're gonna be featuring lower TDPS
so way better power consumption as well
as higher GPU clock speeds than the then
the older
then the steamroller got a very stuff
which is nice om these first we do not
have access to these yet we don't have
review samples quite yet it's going to
all the OEM so they can make their all
in ones their laptops and things like
that whatever they want
mini pcs what-have-you we will be seeing
them maybe sometime next year early next
year or yeah I think I think I didn't
see them in the article but I wouldn't
assume that say it didn't say um that's
my guess
now there are some really nice features
new features on the EP use direct x12
support being a pretty big one for all
you Windows 10 users out there 4k media
playback with h.265 encode and decode
yes that's nice
that is very nice HT PC users will be
will be benefiting them on that as well
the new flagship apu that we are talking
about here for the am 4 platform is the
a12 9800 and according to some
benchmarks it scores 20% higher in the
Cinebench benchmark then the older
steamroller got a vari a a 1088 50
that's a pretty nice boost that is a
very nice boost especially when you
consider the lower TDP to going from 95
watts from the older platform to 65
watts
ok right there and yeah so you're
getting more instructions per clock it's
much faster probably lower heat because
it's got a much lower TDP and your power
efficiency is a lot better it's not
drawing as much power don't need as much
power supply to drive it and I wonder
what it must be like to be an ant
getting flicked at full speed by a human
because they just land somewhere the
greatest rush of your life hey it's
probably the heliport ation that's
probably the same ant it's been crawling
back up over and over again because he's
been good it's like I gotta try that
 again it's like climbing the
waterslide stair what staircase he's
just climbing the pole oh let's go on
again one more time dad more time
I'm just I'm just eating them on so uh
now that's that's the APU the seventh
gen ap use which are pretty exciting
met and just to clarify for anyone who's
confused here
none of these are Zen architecture bases
no no no no this is new socket and four
sockets yes new platform for AMD it's a
unified platform they're taking their AP
use which have been on FM - yep and
their CPUs which have been on a m3 pour
merging the two and they're bringing
them both together so old CPUs whether
you're talking FM 2 or AM 3 will not
work on this new platform but some of
the zeros there they're making and are
based on the old architecture from the
previous platform right so so 7th gen AP
use as well as Zen CPUs are going to be
working on the aim for chipset which is
which is awesome because it's always
kind of been a headache I think in the
past few years you know trying to I
don't I mean you don't relate to
distinguish but it just makes things
simpler for developers I would say in
terms of developing for the platform
they just have one platform to think
about whether they're going for Zen or
they're going for the 7th gen ap use the
excavator chips so that's really nice
motherboard manufacturers as well
they're not gonna have to choose alright
we got a product stack for this platform
we got one for this platform it's just
am for now it's a unified medium for
both of these trips which is pretty nice
my big question and this is some of the
first solid information we've seen about
actual chipsets on the new with along
with the new am for sockets so they have
them listed here in this slide for small
form-factor there's an the xB and a 304
essential or kind of kind of your
baseline I feel like is what this is is
Andy a 324 mainstream you have AMD be
350 and then for enthusiasts you still
have TB a now my nose my big question
here is going to be when Xen launches
will you have to have
that's enthusiasts chipset to run a Zen
CPU that's not known what name for
chipset yeah no I am for is the socket
oh right right we're talking chipset
okay right well we're talking
requirements to have a Zen CPU because
I've been kind of talking about about
doing for a while it's like okay
get I am for out there and II get get
some am for boards out there cuz I'd be
like look sure buy a name for board
right now get an APU drop it in there
and then wait till next year and then
upgrade your your APU or whatever you
bought this year to a Zen based CPU and
get yourself lost lots of CP if you can
if they're gonna let you do that yeah
they're gonna let you do that and that's
really not sure yet yeah and there's
been a lot of discussion about power
requirements for Zen what that's gonna
be like and really if the boards are
gonna need to be fundamentally different
at all other than just their sockets and
some of the basic like I feel like that
would really shoot them into the foot if
they did that because it would kind of
defeat the whole purpose of yeah am for
being a unified platform where it's like
yeah okay you just kind of made things
more confusing in fact because now you
have the the unified socket which is not
really a full unified platform but now
you might need a you know a special
enthusiast grade chipset to actually run
as in CPU which is still going to divide
everything for the developers as well as
the motherboard manufacturers so and
it's gonna be more confusing for
consumers and stuff so now that we have
this information that's been clarified
to some degree by AMD what I need to
know
hopefully they'll say this at the point
or at least give us some indication of
what to expect in the future when I am
for boards actually start coming out and
being available for sale which we're
expecting before the end of this year I
need to know if I buy a name three be
fifty be 350 board can you upgrade later
if I can draw more CPU into that into
that board or if they're gonna be
talking like now you need to get this
new chipset sure it's the same socket
but you need the new chipset so
hopefully they don't do like an
overclocking thing we're like you can
only overclock on the enthusiast chipset
or something yeah I mean that's another
that's another I mean that's how that's
how Intel exactly so
so yeah there's there's a big question
mark there and it's really gonna affect
a lot of my recommendations for people
building systems towards the end of this
year because you know I'll I'll
recommend Intel to you you know because
they you know they got their
together for the most part they're
expensive but they're also very fast I
want to recommend AMD to I want to say
here's your other option but I'm not
gonna say here's your other option
because I always like recommending a
system build with an upgrade path and
I'm not gonna say yeah get this unless I
know for sure I can say yes and then
when then comes out you can drop your
Zen CPU into that - yeah so I hope
there's some overlap there I can
understand like the the lower end
chipsets maybe yeah boxing out Xander
saying you know these are only gonna be
for certain processors with certain
level of core i3 equivalents or
something but yeah right alright let's
move on to our next topic which is about
the GTX 1050 this is kind of interesting
there was a leaked screenshot from gpu-z
courtesy of bench life guys over there
have leaked this and their source is
saying that the card will feature the
new a new a brand new fourth chip the
fourth chip in the Pascal lineup yeah um
so right now we only have three we've
got the GP 102 on the Titan X we've got
GP 104 and then 770 in 1080 and GP 106
yeah if you want a six from the 1060 so
we've got GP 107 potentially for the for
the GTX 1050 here
codenamed GP 107 - 400 which is kind of
an indication based on and videos like
naming scheme that this is gonna be a
fully enabled chip it's not gonna have
any disable of course it is specifically
a die that's created for this card
no cut-down iteration of anything the
specs according to the sources and this
slide that was was captured is that the
the 1070 I'm sorry the 1050 is gonna
have 768 CUDA cores 48 TM use 32 ro
piece a core clock speed of thirteen
hundred and eighteen megahertz and a
boost of thirteen hundred and eighty it
should there's a lot of shoulds maize
cans probably's in this article it's all
rumor and speculation for now we
know how trustworthy the source is all
we can go is you know take it with a
grain of salt for what it's worth but
they're saying it should feature up to
four gigs of gddr5 at seven gigahertz
yeah and then that's going to equivalent
to one hundred and twelve gigabytes per
second of bandwidth on a 128 you just
made a new word equivalent Aquila late I
I stand by that creation that beer
equivalents to at least two beers and in
its ABV content yep equates is just so
mainstream um now the exciting thing
about this car it's 75 watts really did
you mention that are you about to have
the exciting thing about this is hard is
the 75 watt TDP this pre-emptive mother
which which is cool in for several
reasons one it's like super low power so
the power supply requirement is going to
be a lot less than something like say
even the 10 60 or the ten seventy
especially I'm giving one worth 250 or
300 right which means you don't have to
spend as much on a power supply which is
an awesome and secondly you can get
pretty much all your power through the
motherboard slaughter PCIe slot on the
motherboard which means no PCIe cables
which I mean yeah that's that's freaking
awesome that's less cable management
that you have to worry about a tidier
system reduces kind of any interference
with airflow in your case you have to
worry about like ugly power supply
cables or likes leaving that
whatever it is it's just kind of a
really nice object news unless your
answers to customers unless you're in
source customs all right guys yep but
however if you are buying a 1050 you
probably aren't gonna spend extra money
on sleeve cables did you see his tweet
to me after it came out that the the PCI
Express Gen 4 like stuff stopped killing
my business you dick hole or yeah cuz we
talked about that like well no more PCI
Express power cables needed no more no
more that stuff's I'm selling the
business like I I still make them you
can't kill me I'll be around forever but
but however you there's going to be a
very high probability that
bored partners are going to include PCIe
connectors on their aftermarket cards of
the GTX 1050 because they want to market
that they want to say well they
can't we'll look this one's got an
additional six pin or an eight pin power
connector which is gonna give you more
stability when overclocking or even more
overclocking potential and just more
juice for like the fans the custom fans
we have on here things like that
whatever is RGB LEDs you have more power
now allocated you're not gonna be
limited by the PCIe slot on your
motherboard because they're adding more
 to it so they want to like beef up
everything all the things so they are
that in mind this is going to be
expected to be close to 150 dollars
which makes sense to me I mean the GTX
1063 gigabyte variant is $200 to stay
competitive with the 4 gigabyte rx 480
so it makes sense if they're trying to
undercut that it's going to be obviously
slower than the 10 60 even the 3 gig
version with its uh you know even though
it's been cut down a bit it's also
expected to perform close to the AMD rx
470 so yeah I actually haven't read too
many other reviews on the our export 470
or what the performance is like but I
would assume that's kind of like better
than the GTX 960 somewhere between the
960 and the 970 is where the 470 would
lie which is pretty damn good actually
for 150 bucks like this could be very
good for people who were trying to game
at 1080p you know not concerned about
quad HD plus and they just want
something that can do medium even high
settings potentially in triple-a games
that could be kind of cool well that's
always good with a new series of
graphics cards launches cuz it pushes
the entire stack down and you can always
get more performance coming at a lower
price or the sword yeah sometimes our
performance for the same price if you're
looking for the same price for more
performance yeah exactly
yeah or you pick more performance for
more money for more money
it makes sense real lunacy thank you for
your $20 donation whoa
Jude just because because I like that
that's a great stuff copy what you
haven't that we've been spending too
hardly right I know we got to close it
wasn't change what happened all right
let's move on to our next story GC x
1050 sounds very exciting but we've got
more to talk about here first of which
hackers this is important hackers all
right guys if you guys are jerking it on
browsers you should be concerned right
now not just because there are better
porn sites out there and what I've been
told but that but because hackers just
dumped 800,000 close to a million
browsers accounts on the dark web they
dumped those accounts on the dark web
all the data came from the companies
forum on the browser's forums the data
set according to sources contains nine
hundred and twenty eight thousand
individual records with seven hundred
and ninety thousand unique email
addresses along with many usernames and
plaintext passwords so might now might
now might be a good time to change your
passwords if the password you used for
browsers is also the password you used
for anything else just a suggestion just
looking out from my browser's homies you
know I'm saying hackers might be able to
read private messages sent via the forum
and I think this is almost more
intrusive now this forum that had been
hacked with all these users was used to
discuss existing existing porn scenes
private messages hit private messages
that were used there's a forum that when
people were on to discuss existing porn
videos what they thought about the
scenes they really conversing like I was
 great acting and that one said
no one ever but I mean still it could
happen and also best da do ever da do da
what it's like is
whose daughter life like a whole type of
it don't worry about it don't worry
about all right am I gonna get into it
right now we are on Twitch are you cut
that's true really good we're already on
the radar for the dildo stunt so and
also people are like offering
suggestions on this forum and through
these private messages on what they
would like to see in future future porn
now I don't your porn videos don't say
like recommendations and like had a jerk
it um I'm sure maybe that's even there
too I think the thing is that debt
should be on like the someone said in
the article like school resource the
will they sit in the article like kind
of uh you know is kind of true like okay
someone discovers maybe from this leak
that you watch porn which can be a bit
embarrassing for sure but that still
doesn't really tell you much about the
person but if you had excesses that they
are like alive you just tells you that
they like to jerk it like anyone else
but if they were like able to see your
private messages that you that you were
sending on a porn website that's very
personal those are like things that are
like deep inside you that you only share
anonymously you are with like people
you're really close with so that's good
that can potentially be the most
revealing part about this whole hack
here hey I think that was that was also
taken to the article by the time do you
monetize exactly but if you are
concerned at all you brazzers bastards
out there that you have been a victim of
this dump
you can go - have I been poned calm this
is legit I mean this is apparently what
the article is recommended for here from
WC CF Tech have I been poned calm to see
whether or not your dirty messages have
been totally hacked so just imagining
like the watercooler conversations right
it's like dude did you hear about that
browsers dumped oh yeah man if it was
awesome that's not what I was
referencing but it's good to know that
you're okay that's next three looks like
you didn't even need to be axed exactly
all right
let's go on to our next story here which
is about the new USB type-c to HDMI spec
and what it's all about I'm sure you
guys have been seeing this all over the
interwebs hm HDMI licensing which is the
the people who decide whether or not
something is HDMI compatible or HDMI
compliant they're releasing an
alternative mode and alt mode is what
they're calling it for USB type-c
devices that's going to allow HDMI video
signals pass through a Type C cable or
connection without like a super fancy or
expensive dongle because apparently
that's what's been needed so far you
actually need a dongle or a doc to
convert the DisplayPort signals that are
natively output by the UM the type C
standard so that's pretty cool this this
is like free-range laptops tablets
smartphones you can pretty much you will
be able to link these devices straight
to an HDMI output using perhaps like
just a simple type-c USB type-c to HDMI
cable pretty cool
however there are limitations I will say
about this for one it's not backwards
compatible so if you already had sort of
a setup where you had like a expensive
dongle to make it work you're still
gonna need that dongle you have to hold
on to that dongle it's not gonna be you
can you can't just swap that out and
less and say newer hold that dongle
standard hold it never let that dongle
go that was a great word I love a
massage it also also after you massage
it you'll also realize that the alt mode
that we're talking about here only
supports the older HDMI 1.4 B standard
for now so this is essentially a
crapshoot for gamers right cuz if you
want a game at 4k you're gonna want a
game at 60 Hertz no less but since it
doesn't support hdmi 2.0 B you can't
really do that you're still gonna be
gaming at 30 Hertz at that 4k which is
no good by the way thank you my knees
for the $5 donation guys how soon do I
have to worry about my 4790k bottle
like you my GPU I'm running a GTX 1080
right now don't worry about it yeah
don't go on my channel and look up the
video that I've done comparing the 2600
K to the 6700 K I believe look that up I
test the same graphics card it's the but
your constant your 4790k should be able
to overclock as long as you have a
decent CPU cooler 4.5 to 5 gigahertz get
it up in the four six four seven four
eight range you're good you're good for
a year to at least several years I would
say unless you about next what games are
on the horizon but yeah yeah 4790k Zen
absolutely they're all still absolutely
beautifully for gaming duke games
especially with the threading and all
that yes okay um so the other thing that
I wanted to say okay that was that was
not much there was not much else to this
to the limitations of this new standard
this mode other than HDR is not
supported either yeah yeah is there
anything about enhancing the spec in the
future to allow for a higher range of
HDMI connectivity via there isn't but I
would assume that's the direction
they're heading I would assume they're
just doing it one thing at a time and
it's it's nice they at least for you
know basic laptop users because laptops
are starting to get a lot more USB
type-c connectors on them so if you
happen to want to output to your video
signal from your laptop to HDMI monitor
makes a lot easier for that just kind of
like you know you see HDMI kind of
catching up with all the other standards
because we've got what DisplayPort now
that that is already supporting a USB
type-c as well as Thunderbolt 3 like
you've got you know with like even my
MSI laptop has that support so finally
we've got HDMI in the mix and I would
assume that they're going to eventually
implement support for like 30 Hertz 4k
and things like that HDMI 2.0 B but
we'll have to wait and see let's move on
to our next story here in the news is
the Samsung recalling their Galaxy Note
7 I'm
to just briefly talk about this because
Paul already talked about it in his app
they respire fire they're blowing up
look like this phones of fire yep
so if you guys want more information on
this you can either read the article
that I'll post in the description later
or you can go ahead and watch pulse off
the show where we talk a lot of it a lot
more about it I like this specific gear
VR warning yeah cuz you don't want
something positioned like too much lean
Runnin Rebels to combust fire yeah now
to be fair they're talking about it's
like the fires have been happening well
as well charge was charging right so two
people typically run gear VR with the
phone plugged in like that's difficult
right
I mean I don't I think it's I think it's
a hassle but I don't think it's
difficult eat some USB extension cords
and that kind I mean let's say you had
you were doing it like you're just
watching VR porn at the park no AC
outlet oh yeah did that earlier today
exactly that's why I was that's why I
brought them brought up this example um
maybe you've got a you know a battery
pack in your pocket and you've got a
lengthy USB microUSB cable that's
connected to your phone all you have to
worry about my USB cables very lengthy
lengthy so I mean I'm sure that
there are certain there are some people
out there heard doing this sort of thing
but yeah the things are catching on fire
there's been a massive recall they
shipped out 2.5 million units and
they're taking them all back saying no
these all might explode watch out some
dude
Amazon's offering full refunds Amazon is
issuing full refunds but do you not even
need to send the phone back they are not
requiring that because they have no way
of enforcing it right um I guess if you
want a refund you just you just hit him
up bill yo cannot read my bitch I should
ask for a refund do they have any way of
checking if you've actually bought one I
don't know maybe I'm sure people have
already tried that
yeah possibly Samsung's also offering
note 7 replacements or you can exchange
your note 7 so we we did this in
swordfight like would you give them
would you have Samsung a second chance
if this happened and for those of you
who voted no if you completely burned
then you can you can get an s7 edge you
can exchange you for an s7 or an s7 edge
just to write regular ngon note phone
plus the price difference because the
note I believe is more expensive also
Samsung's offering anyone who's affected
by the recall a $25 gift card as a
gesture of appreciation now it seems
like different cell phone providers are
handling it in different ways like for
instance Verizon I saw somebody tweets I
forget who it was earlier today
like really Verizon I have to go back
and wait in line at the store again
should return this and get the
replacements after I already waited
three hours to get the phone in the
first place or something like that right
they said they stopped selling the note
seven and they're making refunds or
exchanges free through September 30th
that also seems like I don't know I mean
that's about a month but that's not that
long a time no it seems reasonable seems
weird to have the cutoff be I feel like
that should be oh you mean like for them
to like refund it or yeah yeah I agree
like if you have a defective note 7 and
you go in in October right right like
sorry you have to keep your shitty
defective phone that might catch on fire
yeah that's that's kind of sad
if you like six months or some to
return that AT&amp;amp;T is stopped sales and is
offering replacements to effective
custom affected customers but not too
many details as far as timeliness or
anything like that
t-mobile is accepting refunds and
waiving all fees related to the recall I
feel like t-mobile does a good job with
customer service for the most part yeah
Sprint is asking customers who bought a
note 7 to go to Sprint stores to receive
a similar device until the issue is
resolved so you kind of get a rental
phone until ok until you get your
replacement or your exchange these
models in there that makes sense there's
also information in this article this is
Android Authority by the way for Canada
if you're in Canada and it's a fake use
so let's links in the description yep
so um yeah interesting interesting news
not the best news for new Galaxy Note 7
users
but hopefully you guys get it figured
out don't blow your faces off in the
process and next up we've got hot and
heavy hardware this is our next segment
where we talk about hardware that's hot
and heavy the first of which being the
new razor blade now I've been using the
razor blade for quite some time now this
just laughs up I'm currently using this
is the older generation though it's
weird for me to say it's the older one
because I feel like I just got it and
it's still rocking like a skylight CPU
also kind of a buying laptop yeah
exactly it's got a gtx 970m processor in
it but that this new blade oh
yo bro this new blade though it's got a
full-blown GTX 1016 it so you get the
full 6 gigs of the RAM gddr5 we've
already talked about this on previous
episodes of the show very recently that
there's all these new Pascal laptops
coming out with full-blown desktop GPUs
of the 10 series and they're not cut
down they're not mobile chips they're
not mobile versions so this new blade is
still 14 inch it still forms same form
factor which I like because it's super
portable it can can fit into a really
slim backpack but it's gonna be packin
some extremely impressive horsepower
with the GTX 1060 as well as a skylight
core i7 6700 HQ CPU so that I mean with
the two of those things it's it's
definitely going to be VR ready and
that's how they've marketed it as well
I just starting okay so here's also a
controversial thing I don't know for me
it's gonna be this like I said same form
factor 14 inch screen however they're
gonna offer two models now the glossy
panel with 3200 by 1800 resolution the
IGZO the XO resolution or you can get
the 1920 by 1080 screen that's Matt now
I this this is right why does the
resolution tank if you go man go Matt I
don't know I feel like it should still
be the same you should be able to buy
either one I feel like I there's a lot
of people who want the higher resolution
but still want Matt right would the
matter glass has nothing to do with how
yeah what the resolution the other thing
is the other thing is if this was if
they had laid out these options
for this model here I would go with the
1920 by 1080 matte in an instant yeah
but now with this that you have the
full-blown GTX 1060 you can run a lot of
triple-a titles at that resolution at
the high resolution 3200 by 1800 yes no
problem but I'm not going to want that
glossy screen necessarily I might want
just something that's a little bit less
reflective especially if you're taking
this on the go you can't always control
where the Sun is in relation to it you
know where you're viewing your laptop
from it's nice to have that matte screen
in my opinion I've never understood the
draw of a glossy screen I know some
people say it looks crisper and all that
kind of stuff I just I don't know I
prefer matte so much - yeah meets you
different strokes yes also weird that
the resolution have dropped so much like
that all the way down to 1080 like give
me a give me a 1440 right like I'll be
happy with that yeah just a little bit
more than I mean 1080 just seems a
little bit yeah a little bit passé at
this point for a notebook of the st. of
this quality yeah I think the only
reason I would allow or accept the 1080
resolution is because it's such a small
screen even for a laptop it's 14 inches
so yeah if you're compressing in it I
mean I'm still a little salty that my
phone has a higher resolution than that
by the way that WCC F Tech article was
all based on a tech powerup article god
damn it I'm looking I'm not linking WCC
f Tech I'm looking at the tech powerup
article no good go everyone go follow
look there therapy they have pictures
that you can click and that show up big
on the screen and centered yay look at
that they're the best
it's the this RGB matrix oh has you
looks exactly the same it does which i
think is a great thing cuz it's it's
beautiful beautiful body laptop stuff
good eye let's move on to our next razor
product razor actually is introduced
another very interesting item here which
is their first the world's first mecha
membrane keyboard I feel like there's
gonna be a lot of controversy make that
membrane a lot of contractors mean make
a membrane that's like Mecca Mecca brain
mecha Streisand
are you trying to say looks like Barbra
Streisand Michael Streisand was from one
of the earlier South Park episodes Mecca
like Mechagodzilla yeah
right you're familiar with Mechagodzilla
so there was a mecca like a a mecca
version of Barbra Streisand yeah she was
like terrorizing an attack I was huge
and mechanical and Barbra Streisand for
a head and yes she like destroyed South
Park they don't even Becca's dress okay
I know I don't yeah it's cool I need to
watch more TV a parent really do know
you don't know never mind
yes you do never mind that so what's
interesting about this what a mecha
membrane keyboard is is it combines like
the soft kind of pillowy feeling of I
like that word pillowy soft the soft
pillowy feeling of membrane keys however
it's still got that mechanical tactile
click so the way they described it in
the article is you get the best of both
worlds but I don't know if everyone
necessarily misses the soft cushiony
feel of a membrane key I think maybe
they do maybe they don't
but however I think maybe some people
would be ok with that feeling again if
it was included with the tactile click
of a mechanical key so you kind of get
the best of both worlds here it's gonna
be available in both green and RGB LED
variants by the way it's called the or
nada are not torn that keyboard so the
or nada comes in two variants the the
green because because Razer or RGB LED
if you get the RGB LED one the RGB one
it features dedicated lighting profiles
for popular games like overwatch call of
duty black ops 3 etc um it's also got a
risk rest that's detachable via magnet I
think that's genius detachable via
magnet wrist rest yes
let's let's do that forever that hasn't
been done before I haven't seen it okay
not having a keyboard man I can't think
of anywhere it's been done before but it
feels like it should have yeah why the
 has taken this long magnetized all
the things that are supposed to be
detachable I mean they
they got it right with the dust filters
eventually finally it did so yeah just
do that just keep doing that with other
things that should that are detachable
um it's gonna be available on the razor
store for some regions worldwide
availability comes in October this was
the most surprising part of this article
the RGB or not a is gonna be a hundred
dollars us okay that seems very cheap to
me seems very for a razor product
essentially appending a razor depending
how you look at it because me cuz rubber
dome keyboards are fairly and I mean
relative to mechanical switch keyboards
yeah are fairly inexpensive to make true
you can get a rubber dome keyboard for
ten dollars true pretty regularly and
it's just a perfectly adequate rubber
dome keep rubber dome keyboard so yeah
that would be my question is is is this
key have they taken a rubber dome
manufacturing process and added elements
to it to make it seem more mechanically
and now they're trying to charge a
mechanical keyboard price for it or vice
versa because that's what I would
suspect just knowing how business works
in the industry and that kind of thing
so yeah if you're saying oh look this is
a mechanical keyboard too like keyboard
only $100 for an RGB whereas you got to
pay probably a hundred and forty plus
for an RGB full mechanical with like
cherry switches or something like that
but what if they're taking the opposite
approach of what you said what if
they're like basing it off of a
mechanical key switch and then just
adding some kind of cushion to that to
make it more comfortable then that would
be a pretty impressive price for that so
I guess that's kind of the question yeah
yeah it's kind of question so we don't
know yet this really needs a good
teardown of the product and everything
yes are these MX which is are they CH
are they mechanical switches at heart or
are they membrane switches at heart
what's the actuation point that you have
to actually go down to register the
keystroke do you have to bottom out you
know is that going to affect finger
fatigue and and things like that so yeah
remains to be seen makes me say a quick
shout out to tremendous mas what all he
is making mercenary from O'Dell
ooh sounds delicious Odell isn't that
this the famous singer I'm out of beer
me too we're almost done here yeah I
would drink more but we're gonna end the
show sooner oh that's later Adele not
odo hang on to that yeah different
knodell but thank you very much for that
tremendous let's move on to our next
piece of hardware and hot and heavy
hardware here which is the Corsair air
740 which you recently did a buildin
Paul there it is
you totally built in a live stream I
maybe have some hands-on experience with
this yes so what did you think about the
build process alright so the build
process was nice and easy yeah I would
assume so as you might expect basically
they took the frame the inner frame of
the air 540 and they put it in something
called the 740 it has different external
units for the top and the Front's that
look a little bit different has a
significantly different look than like
the air 540 or whatever you know
something that I think some people will
be interested it's much more it's much
taller than the air 540 and less cubish
it seems that way yeah I mean it just
looks like that from my picture it
doesn't look that way to what I have not
done is done more than read comments
about saying it's exactly the same like
it's got any expansion slots it could
support a four-way SLI or crossfire
configuration I am NOT positive because
of my lack of familiarity with air 540
if this internal frame is exactly the
same frame its larger or if it is
article it is largest is larger okay
well good kind of read the article and
he knows he knows my research so it is
larger there's plenty room inside tons
room in the front bottom and top for
radiators and fans and all that good
stuff of radiator support 280 at the top
up to 360 at the front and 280 on the
bottom now granted you probably couldn't
install all three of those with having
room to spare for your reservoir pond
might be ball that sort of thing you
might be able to because one of the
things I noticed depends on how thick
your radiators and this is this is
probably um kinds on my Ralph's a bit of
speculation on my part but this is the
hop this is the opposite side of it
there's some weird bracket looking
things over on this
you can move your tron near this cage it
seems to me like if you wanted to get
really fancy with this and I have no
idea of course there has any plans of
releasing a separate side panel on this
side themselves or if they're just
expecting people might mod it but I feel
like Coursera things are window you
could pack the other side with your main
hardware and a bunch of radiators and a
bunch of fans and then put reservoirs
and pumps and everything on this side
via different did you notice any mounts
there's mount at the bottom okay so this
little tray at the but well this little
tray at the bottom is actually for the
power supply I'm sorry it's splits two
different links or whatever it would've
been great if they included mounting
holes for a pump right there I feel like
this might be but I'm not positive you
can't see it from this angle but there's
four little slots right here that looked
very similar to the layout that that
standard like like pumps have okay so
any anything about that so I don't know
so yeah who knows for sure and I'm
speculating a little bit but yeah that
would be nice too I built this system in
it here's my I did ago I did a live on
Saturday I'll show you the very end dude
go yeah it's very hard to get to the
very end of this bone here's the system
hey that that gee chicks one of those
GTX Jenny's looks minutes I was like oh
yeah and I come from I mentioned in the
video that it was from you know I thank
you I'm never returning it hey hey
you zoom in on it's lovely everything
came out quite nicely very lovely so
look out through the air 740 I know
there's been a lot of polarizing
thoughts on the new design I feel like
it's growing on me
like I did not like it at first but the
more I look at it the more I'm like I
could dig it yeah I can dig it I think
it just it's one of those designs that
needs needs to grow in you a bit for
sure yeah it was off-putting at first
but I didn't mind it too much but I can
I can like I sympathize with people who
like ooh I don't like it yeah I told her
this totally it's definitely it's a lot
of plastic and none of these panels on
the top of the front or metal or
anything like that right so it's all
like do you like the way that they have
shaped this plastic and yeah I'm into
all of those things exactly
so next next step our last topic here is
on the new Corsair range of keyboards
their luxe mechanical keyboard range
it's gonna be essentially using the same
kind of aluminum housing lumen ium
housing of the the K series like the K
70k 65 all that jazz so it's gonna look
the same pretty much on a body level
however they're gonna be upgrading the
the lighting so it's gonna be enhanced
lighting USB 2.0 pass through which a
lot of people have been asking for on
the case 70 like including myself and
Paul as well as a backlit optimized key
cap so you're gonna see larger font and
you're also gonna see more light peering
through those key caps to give you more
illumination and all that sort of good
stuff but I I'm not opposed to this I
think I love the aluminum chassis I
think Corsair has done a bang-up job on
their existing body just like the style
the quality it says if it's not broken
don't fix it it's still gonna be keeping
with the Cherry MX switches they didn't
say exactly which ones are gonna be
available which colors but I would
imagine probably the same ones that you
can get on the K series and the pricing
for that is K 70 luxe RGB is gonna be at
160 K 65 is 130 and the case 70 luxe non
RGB is gonna be 120 I would assume the
case 70 luxe did not specify in the
article where I missed it is just gonna
be red LEDs because that's how it was
for the non luxe k70 I feel like they
had been red and blue oh did they have
them in blue too okay no I could be
wrong about that I am right over the
blue ones but I care about lots of
things
yeah a sponsor spot mad hound 3 4 7 7
thank you for your dollar donation he
says he donated 5 bucks earlier perhaps
we didn't see that so sorry if we missed
it if you don't plan to Oh see right
away what cooler would we recommend for
a 6700 K me I would just get the like
the hyper 212 Evo hybrid 212 or the the
cryo rig no the cry rig h7 yeah I think
are both good options
right in the 30 to 35 dollar range and
even when you are ready to overclock
there those still yeah will still be
good for some decent good for you to
moderate gains listen tell you upgrade
to water cooling or something else like
that which exactly you probably don't
even really need to do but really quick
we did want to do a quick sponsor spot
yes for today's sponsor which is be like
thanks to gigabyte for sponsoring our
show gigabyte makers fine computer
hardware such as motherboards graphics
cards best what we're showing off here
today is another motherboard from
gigabyte z170 line so these are
compatible with Intel skylake processors
on the Intel z170 chipset my got to z170
chipset do that see we showed it that's
right there right there anyway this
motherboard features RGB lighting is it
no no what no it doesn't does let's go
LEDs here RGB are they RGB other word
features light you have the show you
said it didn't feature RGB lighting I
wasn't sure about that
no no you're wrong let's talk about I'm
wrong and I need surround LED so I
believe they're blue okay yes there
believe that's why this is the ud3 not
like so that but that's what separates
us from the designatory 170 that we
showed you before right these do have
LEDs up and down right in here they
appear to be blue and up up and up and
up in this area right in here yep and
then a strip along the side here which
appear to be blue according to the box
yes that looks very blue yes if it's not
blue that's really poor choice for the
Box anyway though at least it's blue and
not like read it like matches with the
blue accents and what did you did you
mention that this might sup to on the
right side yeah so that it lets up down
this strip along the right as well right
all in blue it's got blue accents of
course so very similar to the designator
that we already showed you guys as far
as the color scheme goes ultra durable
so they're using their extreme two
ounces or twice the copper and the PCB
design that you would typically need to
use according to the baseline
specifications mm-hmm it's also got
overbuilt power delivery there so along
with the Z ones
new chipset which allows you to
overclock your skylake processors
assuming you have a case key like a 6600
K or 6700 K make sure you can maintain
those overclocks stable e at high
frequencies right I like it stuff also
an IOU got a USB type-c 3.1 port there
as well as display outs for the
integrated GPU on your CPU indeed it's
glorious MDOT - yes and you dot - is
when you dot - as well you can even
raid0 those you can triple raid 0 I saw
that advertised on the box and I was I
was kind of curious how that's laid out
for the first CIE lanes go now with the
typical z170 motherboard you have 16
PCIe lanes coming from the cpu yeah so
that would give you alright you need
eight assuming got a graphics card in
there yeah 8 for the graphics card that
least use 8 more so if you did a by 4
for your PCI Express expansion slot for
a single nvme drive that's 12 yeah if
the u2 is wired up directly to the CPU
but another 4 that would be another 4
this would be 16 yeah and then finally
if you had your chipset derived final
MDOT - so either your MDOT - are you
you're you - if either one of those is
wired directly to this and then the
other one goes through the chipset yeah
chipset has an additional four lanes
right your flex IO that handles all the
i/o four other connected devices and
then yes you could get a graphics card
and three nvme devices all connected but
you would be using every single lane
yeah of PCI you'll have no room for SATA
Express or a second graphics card or
anything well you can still connect it
but like you know you'd start to run
into some conflicts if you're you know
had high speed SSDs going over the same
buses anyway you mean you can do it
yeah I actually be kind of curious to
see be good test
what the what the speeds would be with a
three-way read zero nvme SSDs
figuration Hey but thank you very much
gigabyte for sponsoring this half of my
show of our show and I think that pretty
much does it for my half of this is a
bad episode take a couple questions we
were you were you weren't gonna do that
and now if you say no then you sound
like a couple questions just a couple
yeah it's like when it's like ending the
show with a sponsor spot that's not the
way you should do it all right fine
anyone has a quick question or two okay
yes we have lots of time um according
what are you looking at okay we you
should probably close it off was there
there are notes flying under the door
and I need to tend to okay
so let's let's do jumps and shadows
because Johnson's yeah I do have quite a
few here so we've got Daniel damn Daniel
damn is doing thing no it's not flash
BIOS flash for shirt stay positive and
another BIOS will you about three shirts
brother Daniel whoo double Johnson can't
ring the bell with no more beer in it
that's okay
I also picked up a zero insertion force
shirt Thank You Danny next up we've got
one from David David
that's okay thank you very much David
let's hear it on my half and I wasn't
you did you did pick up a stay positive
shirt for me and that's cool we've also
got one from Richard I think I saw
Richard from you I think you've got a
Richard in there somewhere maybe you saw
you got our nose oh you're Richard
reserves thanks very much brother let's
mark mark no mark you get you get a ring
mark you get a ring from me thank you
very much for picking up a CPU closure
Burke loo okay um yes what do I have
here yes I have Matt a wait did I get
mad um I might be overlapping the last
half of the show but I think this is new
uh Johnson for Matt Matt thank you very
much thank you shirt and him up well the
answer for Jonathan
also a thumbscrew shirt and a mug that's
a very popular combination oh yeah also
for Daniel we already gave him that
double Johnson Vega Daniel again will
double up that double Johnson it's a
double double and Richard
I waited Richard we got we have rich or
two yeah but you know what the hell it's
raining yes so thank you guys very much
for tuning in that's going to conclude
