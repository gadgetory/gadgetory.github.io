now we need into my half a little bit
that's okay
no and I really that much interesting to
talk about anyway it's also when this
always happens that it's the stream when
we're like we need make sure we finish
on time today yeah we're gonna be really
efficient and yes cuz because we have
reservation if a reservation later yes
we do I really love to tell them about
that or no we can I mean it's gonna come
out at some point okay
it would have it would have potentially
been in the thumbnail had we time to
make one yeah that's so it's your live
on your show by the way
yes let's go so welcome people people of
YouTube greetings welcome and thank you
for joining us on today's show this is
episode 101 of awesome hardware and if
you're watching this live then sorry
really bless your soul because you
should have left a long time ago this is
pretty damn late over half an hour going
on 40 minutes late here so we do
appreciate you guys sticking around but
we do we're gonna try to do our best to
uh to deliver a fun and an informational
show as we never do so first
announcement that I want to say really
quick though yes that it's Paul's
birthday ah okay tomorrow
that's today it's today okay good Thanks
tomorrow it could be tomorrow it could
be it's it's sometime might have been
yesterday yeah a 10 day radius plus or
10 days but it is Paul's birthday time
yeah and so happy birthday Paul thank
you you don't look a day over I am 45 I
am older now everyone wish Paul a big
effing happy birthday mmm and that's why
we got to make this these these half of
this episode quick because we've got
dinner reservations you gotta go out and
celebrate with Paul gonna get crunk and
I don't want to miss that so wish him a
happy birthday fallen when twittered
Paul's hardware and and just make his
life miserable with all your all your
birthday wishes that he will just little
blow up his phone break his Google pixel
oh geez I will be the best birthday gift
so yeah but I think the other things
that we have to announce or that Paul's
also ended his giveaway his very
successful giveaway I think
is now closed for the count it's
officially done thanks to any guys who
entered it was super successful I had I
had a lot of positive feedback I was
really happy about that because I was
trying to make sure that there's
something for everyone in there and I
know you know not everyone from
everywhere can always have some chance
to win but I didn't I didn't it wasn't
ever there wasn't anything for me
well you're ineligible since we are oh
thank you chat for all the happy
birthdays oh my god everyone you guys
are lovely people
I love you you're alright I love
you so much you're alright yeah yeah so
cool that's out of the way and then
we're selling stuff on our stores as
always
mine is bit with tech slash store you
can visit that link our beautiful
moderator self processing and perhaps
some others will be paste in links and
chat throughout the show where you can
buy some off of awesome stuff on my
sites I just got a couple new shirts
including the game revolution shirt
crystal RGB as a sort of throwback for
those who are familiar with that video
and bunch of other stuff there too I've
also got glasses and mugs Paul also has
a store that's almost hardware dotnet
and if you go there you can buy a
similar stuff but different designs sit
same quality we go through the same
t-shirt guy and if you happen to buy
something from either of our stores at
the same time within the same within the
same like time frame I'd say within a
few days or so
oh the same day then you'll get a small
kickback on shipping and you'll also get
a loud loud Johnson shout out slightly
offensive thank you from me and Paul by
the end of this show highly sought after
Perez very very sought after and I think
on that note we can do a quick beer call
I am drinking some beer that was brought
over by Jose our friend our good friend
and also Paul's editor Jose just my
editor he had it's one or two videos for
me every week yes he he stopped by the
other day and he brought me some
birthday beer which I was not expecting
so thank you Joe I'm drinking the
Imperial Stout from mother earth Brewing
Company
I believe I've had this before syntax it
says and there's a peers to be a
succubus on the bottle sexy sexy but it
tastes better cuz I'm not drinking that
yet I'm finishing there's an it's
succulent
I'm drinking an Elysium a split shot
espresso milk stout
she sounds quite tasty this doesn't get
me to rekt I feel like I've got enough
it's like 6% oh yeah we're good I feel
like I got shitty enough for Q episodes
last week yeah last week was a unique
experience yeah
hey we should get right into your
segments let's do it okay let's do to
fund or not to fund that's fun
hey lower thirds are broken today okay
cool I mean I can show them briefly like
there but but then we disappeared by the
way thank you very much Bobby for the
five dollar donation we will be reading
all donation messages at the end of this
half so they have to be five dollars or
more though especially since we're on a
time crunch so just bear that in mind we
will you will be heard at the end of the
show but okay yes coo coo coo drone to
fund or not to fund first off is where
Paul and I take a look at some
crowdfunding campaigns and we just
either laugh at them or we go hey that's
pretty cool it's usually one of the
other we should buy that so yes so this
is the Q drone I believe it's pronounced
that way it's a it's a nano drum with a
4k camera that features GPS auto follow
so I guess this is like the next
generation of taking selfies perhaps of
course you can use your your Android or
iOS device to control its but that's no
fun you want to be able to like throw a
ball around with your friends and have a
drone follow you around and be like oh
I'm in the future this is what the
future is like look we're in California
and palm trees the old people are stupid
so it's got GPS vision positioning so
you know it's got your favorite position
and look at these guys on the beach look
at how happy there look it just follows
the ball it's like a ball
August says it talks he talks to you
talks to the ball to keep you company
it's like you it's it's also a therapist
it's also a little mini therapist but
look how happy that guy is come on this
is the happiest person to see a drone oh
my god
gonna be like hi out of his mind one
more time and the kids getting it he
doesn't fully grasp it yet but he's
learning so this thing is kind of a fun
little gadget I guess if you're into
drones particularly around one
$6,000,000 that's what caught my eye
initially is that yeah over a million
dollars funded and only a $50,000 goal
so they've you know achieved twenty
three hundred percent twenty three
hundred percent of their goal and
they've still got two days left to pick
one of these up it's only a hundred nine
bucks I say only but I guess that might
be a lot for a drone of this capacity I
mean that seems to be a pretty good
price I mean yeah and I think I think it
boils down to the camera obviously you
can't fully trust what the the campaign
video was showing you that was early
bird - you got it you got paid 130 now
it's obviously not going to be like the
4k camera that's on like the DJI drones
right the sensor is not gonna be nearly
as sharp and things like that motion
blur etcetera but if you're looking for
just $100 cheaper alternative that
follows you around it could be a fun
thing to play with if you're really into
taking selfies but let's move on to the
next the next thing which is that the
Atari pong table in the Atari pong
coffee table it's already raised
$300,000 over 300 K of its two hundred
and fifty thousand dollar goal not quite
as much as the true as the drone but
still has met its its goal
it's a playable real-life mechanical
homage to the original pong back in the
day the the tabletop sort of sort of
styled digital game but this is not
actually digital if you look here it's
it's like it's analog I guess it uses
magnets there's a magnet underneath
where it like where what the Paul the
pong ball would be the pawpaw ball only
for your birthday had a play with my
balls that one birthday only playing
with Paul's balls on his birthday so
there's a magnet underneath the ball and
it moves around and it also creates like
retro noises and there's lighting oh
good that's RGB lighting but you know
they look to be having a good time with
it this guy looks like he's really into
pong it's like I made this because I
love pong so much so they took an old
original digital video game and made it
analog mm-hmm looks like we've come
full-circle yeah pretty much how can you
make a retro game even more retro yeah
by like using a by removing older
technology even the outdated technology
with what it was with which it was
originally constructed and replacing it
with it's brilliant even more weight so
how much how much you got a pledge for
one of these forty dollars for a shirt a
thousand eleven hundred dollars nine
ninety wasn't I was confused I don't
have men that ninety gets you a table a
night owl special it didn't say I
couldn't see table in there but I think
you have to be referred by an existing I
believe your dollar backer if you're
referred by another high-roller then you
get that but otherwise you get 1,100
1,100 right now scrub only 55 left only
55 so mmm jump on that if you want to
play your magnet palm yep with your
Atari throwback well your other pong
loving friends so the last one here that
we have on to know to fund or not to
fund is our cube tents cube tent spelled
with a Q and that's always a clever way
of spelling cube it is it sure is and it
sure is Paul and it features a
connectible tents that are easy to set
up within two minutes you can set up
these tents and they connect any way you
choose
they suit either to three or four
persons dome yeah that should be the
quom let's say pod these are pods
that's a dome with a Q this remind me of
the hab units in
and Martian and the Martians oh yeah
yeah definitely so there's a little bit
less possibilities here right you've got
a couple of these cubes lying around and
you just kind of get to peace out or
part out what kind of tent area or
camping area you'd like to have and it's
fairly large I think that one looks like
a two or three person tent huh
it's it's a cubist shape which is a
little bit odd but so you can stand up
in it I mean that you can stand up in it
which is nice so you can change in it
like it seems to fold up very easily
look at that he's doing it all by
himself that's right okay that's pretty
cool and it doesn't take up too much
space obviously a little bit more than a
regular tent does but I think you're
sacrificing that for the ease of setup I
love velcro flaps flaps yes and you see
a range of possibilities here you know
well what this reminds me of is like
it's like look at a hamster obstacle
course for humans you can just link them
up you know like the tubes that hamsters
go hell yeah it's kinda like that but
for for people who like to act homeless
now this used to try to build that sort
of thing for myself when I was a kid
like at a cardboard boxes in stem hmm
this would be this would be a great
let's make it much easier to pitch a
tent I agree with that Paul that's
certainly what it seems like I generally
have trouble with that unless there's
other people around but this lets me do
it look at that it's a big one
Wow but you know what Kennex pictured a
really big tent what kind of scares me
here though did someone could just have
their cube like a complete stranger
could bring a cube along and just attach
it to yours and then I was like you can
do to stop them no because the cubes are
they recognize each other and they lock
you in and then they for no apparent
reason is like this biological do you
read the fine you know suction thing
that happens between them at soom
basically a quarantine all right so so
afraid for 24 bucks you can get LED
strips for 30 bucks I'm just gonna bid
30 bucks to get the universal tunnel
yeah because it's a universal tunnel
goes any which basically is a tunnel to
anywhere in the universe goes to China
that's what they're advertising here it
goes to you a tunnel to anywhere in the
universe for $30 why are they focusing
so much on the time on this cube -
stupid tent Universal tunnel we
may have a universal
for $30 I feel like they really missing
them there it's like the infinity fabric
it's we need to talk the world's we need
to talk to their marketing team yes we
do they need us desperately but right so
for in order to actually get the cube
tent itself 275 is what you got to bid
at this point yeah you'll get it in July
you're just in time for camping season
Hey or perhaps right in the middle of
camping season 8 I'm not perfectly so
that's the the cube tents and I think
out of all three of those I'd probably
go for the cube tense
to be honest I have no interest in the
pollen coffee table that's six that's
expensive to present that is a lot of
money and the cube tents yet or even
cheaper than those drones like 300 bucks
yeah I'm just saying how many cube tents
could you buy for $1,100 I'm just saying
you won't get a pretty decent like
extremely lightweight backpacking tent
for 200 250 bucks which I feel like
would have more use and versatility
where is your coaster you you I told you
give me one you always give me one and
this time you do there's like I'll just
stay in the wood good wood all right pin
the busy we have a dent in my PC in a
while we've got five of you look I love
when the screen goes black everyone said
oh no that's gonna have indeed to change
out the thing in all of those and I did
not have time for that oh it's just not
trying I'm just doing the lower third
yeah just when the light red oval
imitates a pebble you see Kyle had
tweeted out earlier today at a bunch of
people sent pictures of their computers
we're gonna do we're gonna like the
lightning round my knee run
pierre-pierre to my wits says r7 1700
ooh in a m4 building it looks rx 460 a
DIY PC j8e J 180 - W alright so DIY PC
is a company that I all admit I don't
like to have limited experience with
them and my experience with them was bad
because I was forced to do a video at
Newegg on
they're like really really I'm really
really shitty tested it was awful Oh
like it was so dry stuff yeah and they
have like rough unfinished edges and
stuff like that
so the IPC yeah yeah sorry I don't have
the best impression of them this one
looks a little space actually looks
halfway decent oh yeah it's got a paint
interior yeah frettin bags and actually
your table mansion it's pretty on point
management so looks pretty decent there
um I would like I feel like your your I
don't know what do you what do you think
of the vertical and for me it's an
aesthetic thing okay I know there have
been tested on they're really cool it
doesn't really matter well in some
situations it does maybe a one to three
degree difference but I think just
aesthetically it looks better vertically
yeah to kind of go perpendicular to your
graphics card and it sort of also sort
of makes sense with the the directional
airflow of your other case just actually
how it's coming from the right side and
going to the rear this is a personal
thing I mean it looks like you have no
other choice but to route your
supplemental CPU power cable up here
that is probably an unfortunate drawback
just of the case itself but that does
stand out to me just a little bit your
cabling itself is pretty clean I mean
it's all black and it's going where it
needs to go in as efficient way as
possible this this build seems slightly
lopsided towards the CPU with an R with
an arc 460 in there it's a capable
little graphics card so yeah I mean
depending what you're doing with this
system of course sure if you're doing a
lot of heavy lifting that need the CPU
for then you're probably perfect but I
would consider a GPU upgrade in the
future maybe he's an indie game streamer
that's possibly alright here's you XD
XSP except me the XSP ross XSP a regular
guy here's an i5 4460 lacking some power
AF 4460 is not bad not a quad core not
No so that's your that what is that
doubles kit no that's a as well yeah
first PC can afford to build alright got
some blue LED action going on the what
does this subtract what is that yep
Dragonball
that's Vegeta its Vegeta its Dragon Ball
Z you have much more experience with
Dragon Ball Z than I do
hey just cause I'm Asian alright that's
kind of racist Paul you're also younger
than
even younger than me now because it's
member this is true to nominee for life
all right so you gave some cable
management what but what's it supposed
to do here I I would you could buy it
wouldn't yeah you have a flat cable here
I would try to push that back through
through behind this tray here and come
out here and go to the GPO the closest
hole I don't know honestly though it's
not evident whether there is even a side
panel window in this case so if there
isn't or if it's smaller and you can
only see up here then maybe it's less
visible I gotta give you a little bit of
props for your cable management job back
here and the cables coming out of the PC
yeah those sure are bundled up tightly
it's like a cable foreskin yeah if
you're an IT you're not supposed to do
that sort of thing especially if you're
mixing data and power cables but
hopefully everything is working just
fine for you other than that I mean it
looks reasonably clean there I feel like
there's just like some cables flying
around here and there yeah that I see
but again depending on the side panel
window situation it's not that big a
deal other than that your color schemes
on point you got black and blue going
all over and and I bet this is a pretty
solid bill it is interesting you have a
liquid cooler for an on and
overclockable CPU but you know might
just be for lawyers sure there you go I
kind of like how there is that blue LED
fan on it though that's cool yeah
because it matches the other cases it's
it really ties the whole thing together
it does thanks XSP next we've got Andre
Andre GB Monday
7850 k r9 380 8 gigs of period ddr3 and
EVGA 500 watt power supply to 5 under
gig laptop hard drives crier rig h7 and
addy another DIY PC case Wow ok mr.
popular that's a pretty evenly built
system like that yeah CPU and GPU seem
pretty well matched
alright I'll say 470 it's not first 1750
K this is a good choice of cpu cooler
the crabber gate 7 not terribly
expensive 23 but it's gonna do a better
job cooling it's gonna stay a little bit
cooler itself your power supply cables
are probably parts by cables and the
your your hard drive just kind of
floating in here I've done that what
took you in the message don't get me
wrong I've done that many times myself
but this usually the necessity of my PC
we got it we got to be a little critique
through yeah with the with the
mechanical drive I'd be a little bit
more worried about that just floating in
there and I might I might mount that
down or to or velcro it or something
just to keep it from tape it to the
floor with it
jiggling if there's an earthquake or a
tremor or something and then obviously
the cables on your power supply are not
that great I mean you're dealing with
mustard your doom was well the EVGA I
think that's the 500 be probably which
is it perfectly adequate solid decent
bronze power supply but it doesn't look
that hot and it's it's dragging your
score down here when it comes to fit my
PC yep but thanks to Andres thanks for
the submission though and if you've got
Scott Scott 4690k and a GTX 970 super
super clock SL I from EVGA okay so first
off I see dusts that's the problem the
first thing you notice on top of the
cable management of course cleaning so
could use a decent cleaning and cleaning
actually and that looks like vape I
don't know at first I thought it was the
back of an SSD or something but I don't
think that's what it is
it looks like there's a there's a
barcode or something on it here I don't
know weird rival done enhance zoom
enhance dust you can see your finger
prints on the power supply so there's an
SSD and that is a box that's just a box
it looks like a retail box or no it's
like a bracket it's metal it's it looks
like a bracket look a mini for the house
it's like a floppy decorative oh my gets
it maybe it's a dead floppy drive just
chilling why dude can we can we enhance
any further if how far how far and can
we get here you if you if like a animal
dies in your house you don't just leave
it there you guys wake it out and
dispose of it properly like it's a
product of some sort there's bar codes
on it you don't just put bar codes on
some
random piece of metal anyway alright we
press too much I don't know anyway
get rid of that thing so I don't think
it's doing anything yeah yeah in cable
management especially like I don't know
get some did some sleeve cables get some
black sleeve cables
I like digging the the blue LEDs on the
fans I think they this would be a good
situation where some extensions could do
you well I mean if you really really
want to want to spruce things up
aesthetically you should have plenty of
room back here with the c70 case for
extra cables so you can get extensions
it'll also look better for your GPUs
here granted you'll need to get four or
six pin extensions so that I mean your
price is gonna be a factor to consider
there but it would look a lot better
than the daisy chains coming off here
because those those aren't looking that
great and then of course some dusting
would be nice I don't know I don't know
if I'm digging the the blue LEDs the I
believe this is the dark green version
of the C 70 and what appears to be some
bronze or copper it looks black to me
motherboard the z97 xu d3h the case it
might be black there's a very dark green
version of it it could also be black I
think they might do a blackberry started
to tell yeah just just dust just dust
your keys that's that dang out it'll
look 10 years younger promise next step
we're done tile you wouldn't our last
our last guy here for proud he's got a
lot of he's got a 59 30 K core i7 now
x99 deluxe some as memory and a GTX 770
oh two of them in SLI mm-hmm so good God
that that's a light connector that's
really the bridge that is an interesting
bridges like I guess that would be
functional bridge that needs to be torn
down that bridge is completely
unnecessary it's too long these are set
copper these are 7 70s in two-way SLI
you only need a single SLI bridge here
this is this is very much the only one
he has it's gotta be you got it yeah
yeah I mean any other one would be
better but no it's the next 99 deluxe
motherboard maybe it was a refurb or
something and that's the only one it
came with because it comes I've used
this motherboard it comes with an array
yeah the various sli connected
a rigid hard but yeah but yeah that's
that's just a little eyesore sticker and
your power supply kind of clashes with
the blue on your fans yeah if you want
to fans I really like but if your moves
do you remove the power supply sticker
both of them both stickers oh look he's
got the fanox fan extension hub thing
here also for the x99 deluxe
also these hard drives that are mounted
right here looks like a custom thing
yeah I think you just got some cages and
mounted them to the top that's
interesting coming yeah I managed to see
the cables honestly alright so there's
some obvious standout things here like I
mean that's a lie bridge obviously but
like I feel like if you remove the
stickers from the power supply may be
considered an extension or two just to
get rid of some of the ketchup and
mustard and I don't know the key part
the the GPU plugs don't look awful but
they could look better when tidy up
you know these cables and I think it
would vastly improve the look that you
got going on here but yeah I mean
obviously if you just want a quick fix
givers head that's the leverage yeah yep
there you go maybe a quick Justin that's
all for Pitt my Jordan let's do a quick
round of let's just skip face off okay
good idea because flash player is not
enabled in this browser I'm good let's
go with our first story news
Rison v 1,400 and 1,600 benchmarks that
are here from Kyle Bennett two-part OCP
that I took a look at earlier these are
the two SKUs that AMD did not send me or
Paul so I was kind of said most people
didn't send most people in fact but they
did put them up for sale a good week
before freaking Bargo lifted who ain't
needed
sometimes I think you live under a rock
I do all the time
really wait didn't we talk about this
we've been ignoring it at least I've
been ignoring it but this was they were
on sale in multiple locations apparently
in the US and also in South America oh
yes whatever who like bought one yeah
they don't we heard there were retailers
that had risin 5 CPUs and just sold them
break you know yeah got the shipment in
that guy's put up for sale like ya know
yeah I remember that I I for some reason
I thought like a new menace AMD was
selling them directly from their site
and you know like retailer retailers
just screwed up is what happened yes so
whose fault that was maybe AMD had some
blame you the retailers had to blame but
it did seem to happen in multiple
locations so they have been rising 5
reviews out with benchmarks that are
totally legit with actual rise and 5
processors for like a good week yep
I've been trying to ignore them because
yeah wait no wait until we can post that
stuff because we're under we're under
embargo yeah yeah hard Ossipee was one
of the sites that got them and they said
they just bought all four I think that
we're available it was lucky ducks so
yeah yeah they were taken out the 1400
and the 1600 the 1400 is the entry-level
it's the lowest and chip in the risin 5
line up it's got four personal Reds and
65 1 tbp the 1600 it is sort of like
what the 1700 was to the 1700 X in a way
because there's a 1600 X obviously
without the X you're you're giving a
slower clock
inner-box Bock interesting yes so
they're all being tested at very low
resolutions below 1920 by 1080 just to
sort of usually you do that to magnify
take the to take the bottleneck off of
the GPU and put it on the CPU yeah I
think that's exactly what they're doing
which which makes sense to some degree
and in and Kyle goes on to say he's like
no way does this reflect real-world
performance yeah
like anyone who's telling you that this
is real where performance is trying to
mislead you or they're flying so I'm
glad he like kept that in there but it
does have a much drastic but more
drastic gap and what we were seeing in
our tests because we
testing it like 1080 in 1440p yeah but
this does illustrate sort of where the
single core and I guess the multi multi
core performances between Xen and Katie
Lake which is what they're testing
against the core i5 7600 K and the 7700
K I'm not gonna go over too much detail
in the article because I would prefer
that you guys read it and throw hard OC
piece and some cred their way but in a
nutshell the r7 they also tested in r7
led by only four percent over the 1600
which makes the 1600 pretty damn
appealing if you ask me Darce wait Oh
singing the 1700 it doesn't say it's why
although if it's that for you you're
like doesn't really matter which rise in
seven trip it is maybe a little bit
attention but not not a whole lot
there's probably really slight variance
there so rise and seven was and was only
leading in my tests at least and I've
seen a few other people tests in similar
ways the like the excuse the 1800 X and
1700 X even at the same clock speed the
the more expensive CPU still seem to
perform just a little just a little bit
faster but very very slight true but
definitely nothing like no no
game-changer sort of thing by far so the
r7 is leading over the 1600 by only 4%
in these tests and mind you that's at
the very low resolution where there's no
GPU bottleneck to be considered and the
r7 whatever chip even if it's a 1700 the
base model for the r7 lineup that's
still what is that that's like 1308 how
expensive is a 1600 220 is 220 the 1600
yeah it's 220 yeah okay so that's like
yeah that's like $100 around $100
cheaper the 1600 around $100 cheaper but
it's only performing you know the r7 is
only performing 4% better than it so
that makes it really appealing which is
why I actually bought a 1600 today and
that's good I also bought a more weight
to do by 1400 I did I got a buzz lifting
I got this
1,600 1,400 yep Kyle stopped at
will-call and picked his up my inherited
mine are gonna be shipped because I'm
lazy
you lazy although I could have gone and
picked him up tomorrow morning actually
I didn't think of that but whatever it's
fine it's okay I think Mike's story
quelle comics back at Apple and
countersued over iPhone and iPad
royalties this is do we care about this
no all right let's move on move on yeah
IP and employees of night-night arrow
team adblock detective Knight teru teru
sorry if I'm pronouncing it incorrectly
Forbes won't even let my past their damn
thing Tero
ism is a maker they make things they
make they currently are one of the very
few companies in the world who make 60
gigahertz wireless chipsets do we care
about this story enough to bypass Forbes
being fascist okay I'll just give you
the ten-second can tell you can talk
about it we're just not gonna have the
visual okay that's fine
all right at erä I don't want to wait
lift with white list them out of spats
okay yes screw Forbes screw Forbes Anna
Tarot make they make wireless chipsets
60 gigahertz using an radio wave tech
for things like wireless we are so
obviously VRS had some slow adoption I
think everyone as soon as it came out
and we tried that we were like yeah VR
is great and it's exciting it's
expensive as hell but I think really we
all have the same thing in our minds
which was the wires got to go so just a
lot of people are like yeah we try to
make VR and AR even Wireless AMD has has
said that in the past if they're not
trying to get into the hmd space that's
nothing out there going but they still
want to probably optimize their hardware
their CPUs and GPUs
for a better VR experience and so
they've acquired all the assets and the
employees and the IP of this company
that has quite a bit of VR tech under
their belt so um well they're gonna be
using this wireless chipset for if
they're not making HMDs look at this
Engadget article that I was just able to
blow it up and look about the look in
their ink center now we can look at this
chick minute website with the VR headset
he's watching porn she's probably
watching spoiler alert so I don't maybe
AMD just wants to slap their name on on
HMDs
like
basically saying like hey look our
technology is in the vibe our technology
is in the the rift just because they
bought a company that will one day
hopefully implement some of their
technology into those headsets who knows
companies do that they like to get in
everywhere they do get into it just work
it right in there work it right in this
just slide right in but but you know
what maybe maybe they're there maybe
AMD's planning to take these Wireless
chipsets and embed them into their video
cars so instead of having like a VR and
HMV supported HDMI port like at the
front of the card look for a
pass-through it's just a wireless
chipset that's built into the card and
you can just it's that would be via
already like okay you can put V already
on your retail box if there's a wireless
VR chipset built into your video card
I'm okay with that
that'd be pretty cool that would be
pretty sweet not having to deal with
because you get a pass there it's like
okay there's like the three cases that
have HDMI pass-throughs on them I bet I
bet panel I bet Vega is gonna have that
big yes absolutely since AMD bought this
come Scott like yesterday yeah they're
already totally gonna have it integrated
well you can call this immediately this
more dad Scott told us it's happening
that's happening guys relying Scott
didn't tell us any of that no but yeah
exciting stuff maybe we'll see some
other stuff put to use in 2018 let's
move on to the last story here which is
about the new windows windows power
plans is this articles been out for this
news hit a few days ago and actually you
mentioned it in your memory overclocking
your rise in memory overclocking video I
did it you used it as well I used it in
my residence you saw I mean of course it
was kind of hard to make him MD was like
hey we'll give you like an extra 50
bucks if you use the this power plan we
all know that you're an AMD shill Paul I
was like just saying the AMD dick I was
like make it 60 call it even uh so why
were eating out tonight heyo
she said balance mode is has known to
actually Park Rison course just
aggressively which sucks
it makes for poor performance but yet
high performance mode isn't very
practical because even though it does
increase your performance a bit
you're also running at higher voltages
the balanced mode does do a fine job of
lowering those power states when you're
not under a heavy load so it's kind of
just wasteful even though you're on a
desktop it's easy to perform even better
than the high performance plan too
because yes so this what the new update
does it's kind of in-between it changes
it sort of modifies how Windows 10
treats the physical and virtual course
so in Windows 7 it would have all of the
all the physical cores awake and all of
the virtual course would be parked but
in Windows 10 Windows 10 has one
physical core awake and one virtual core
awake with all the other corners asleep
and it only like it only wakes them up
when it needs them but that's why we
were seeing subpar performance in
Windows 10 compared to Windows 7 and
that's why everyone thought it was the
Windows 10 scheduler that was bogging
performance down but after a AMD sort of
released this article and this update in
their blog that kind of like you know
just said they freed the scheduler of
all blame for for these performance woes
so that's kind of interesting so now we
now we have a new performance plan that
you will have to get as Paul mentioned
in his video you'll have to get that
yourself it's not just going to come
with a Windows Update automatically you
have to go to the AMD blog and download
it but I would suggest if you are
running a rising chip of any kind
you should definitely get on board with
that power plant it's very easy to
install very easy to install and
according to AMD can get you up to a
twenty one point six percent bump in
performance in crisis three or a four
point four percent increase in GTA 5 and
and battlefield one is like eight
percent war and sixteen percent which is
the pretty pretty good that's why my my
rise in five benchmarks with GTA 5 the
GTA 5 performance was pretty good with
the resin chips they definitely closed
that gap a little bit it's actually good
to see when nice and first launch and
like rise and seven stuff and people you
know we first were like man it's weird
this gaming performance anomaly and
stuff like that basically the main
talking points if you're good
be critical of the rise and launch and
my impression was like man that doesn't
seem like something that in my
experience in the past can be fixed like
a GPU comes out drivers can mature and
get better and be be specifically
tailored for certain games and stuff
like that and you can have a lot of
improved performance over time I hadn't
seen that as much with CPUs but I'm glad
to see that was stuff like using
different power plans and whatever
however it's done as long as it's not
crazy complex as long as it's somewhat
accessible to you know your basic home
user then yeah I'm up for whatever they
can do to eat get more performance I
agree but that is going to sum it up for
my half of the show again we're cutting
it a little bit short today because we
are on a time crunch so really quick
just a couple things that I wanted to
point out Johnsons we have to do some
Johnson's really quickly that's let's do
that quick oh boy Johnson Wow you guys
you guys you guys you guys guaran
guarantee q very much sir Johnson to you
Jason Johnson Johnson with Jason Johnson
for Jason we got two more here Jeremy
Jeremy Johnson a lot of I like it when
the name start with J cuz it goes well
garan double Johnson Joe for that Jason
double Johnson yes I'm just catching up
here but to double Johnson's you know
they've come in Fast and Furious
James oh no a low stock for something
and Michael Michael Johnson did you do
was there Jeremy yes Jeremy Jeremy whoo
wow you got a significant amount of pro
Jamie good luck to you and Michael we
love you guys fantastic all right so um
we do have the donations do you want to
say that for your half of the show or do
you wanna get them out of the way now
let's go over them now there's this okay
many thank you all right thank you PI
for the $20 donation with no comments hi
it's just like hey here's 20 bucks
my favorite kind of comment is a good
comments cash wahby even the $5 these
are happy birthday Paul oh thanks Bobby
how bad did you guys smoke smoke well we
told you that we say we set him we sent
him packing back to Canada right yep
that's where they are now
yep - doesn't even have one of the
legs before before before the end of
scrapyard Wars they weren't planning
they were like we're gonna stay here and
then then we smoked him yep then they're
like well we better go back to Canada we
put him in our pipe exactly we lit him
up exactly
smoke the out of those guys Tech
and TAC $5 donation again with no
comment there is a race that didn't
Nelson for the $20 donation yeah you get
an orange
hey guys love the show quick question I
just clean my pc and now my fans are
running at full speed and I can't slow
them down and the idea how to slow them
down on an ACC 97 a UEFI doesn't give me
many options um according to the mother
the UEFI should give you options yes the
you 97 a like you can control or
something consider if you really can't
get any control over them you've got a
couple of their options one is to buy
inline resistor cables that you plug in
inline which just adds a resistor which
will lower the voltage go into the fan
and lower the RPM so actually used I
have a few of them sitting around in
certain situations that come in handy
the other option would be to consider
like in and expect inexpensive fan
controller you can get those for you
know 20 to 40 bucks and those do offer a
bit better controls over the fans
usually depending on which one you get
of course those will be my suggestions
but I feel like within a Suzy 97 board
there's you should you should be able do
something about that update the BIOS
update the boss depends on the head of
your plugged into sometimes it'll have
control over like three or four headers
and then it'll be a couple more that
don't have control and maybe you're
plugged into those so check manual 2 and
also maybe you're booting straight into
like the Advanced Mode or something and
sometimes you have to go into your like
the the easy mode and where it's more
like visible where like the cue fan
control is yeah some people don't know
that you can switch between different
UEFI modes so to speak and there are
certain features that aren't on one or
the other I don't know that is a fan
expert motherboard but mmm if it is then
you'd be able to load the software for
that anyway thank Jim's intonation Shane
10 bucks stimulus both y'all channels
and builds we love you yeah yeah hi
Reed Heckman $10 donation
Windows Update killed the stream should
have switched to Linux that Wendell
could hook you up there either way happy
birthday thank you read yes thank you so
much all hail thee ever know what killed
the stream at the beginning was my GH
for refusing the output via HDMI
randomly strangely for some reason we
are now actually capturing to a
different capture card them usually
capture to long story anyway well yep
we'll talk about it later and Kara doc
Robertson for the $5 donation with no
comments Tara doc Jesse wanted to say
here's five bucks why thank you guys so
um thank you so much for joining us
again apologies at the beginning for
being late as we were but we're not done
yet we still have Paul's have to go so
there's a link in the description of my
youtube video or you can just stay here
if you're watching on twitch if you're
watching this after the fact then go
ahead and toss us a like on this video
and we will see you momentarily thanks
