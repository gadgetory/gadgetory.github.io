doing today a flea market I've always
wanted a pet flea
do they have a bunch of types so is it
like a flea circus
where you can't buy them they're just
there for entertainment you would take
me to a place where the fleas were given
jobs because all living things are just
like people
my phone's been acting out Google pixel
- this is the non XL but it's been it's
been acting funky volume isn't always
responsive what's what's what's your
phone bill wait what the heck and the
time is wrong the time like okay I need
a new phone like stats daylight savings
thing what really oh my god so we just
lost an hour today yes that's one less
hour I have to buy a new phone
great I'm hungry I don't like peanuts I
don't know there's a circus oh it's one
of these events where the parking lot is
just grass it's not even any lines on
the ground this is chaos wow this place
is huge wow that's intense oh you didn't
tell me it costs money to get in we
should go home can we go there can we go
give me go there Oh antiques I see if
you didn't know why vsauce is kind of an
antique junky so I'm surprised you
didn't marry a much older man these buds
let us please butts me like please we
want butts or please but settle down
I'll take five of the bunny mask and
three of the mannequin I think I found
my next gaming chair dxracer better
watch out and those switches feel mini
can you tell if the Cherry MX blue is or
Browns
no no they got the click I think they're
blues oh my god I'm so glad you stopped
wearing those honey what do you think
honey would you ever you were dealing
these it's definitely a statement piece
has this really cool aesthetic to it I
just can't keep my eyes off of it
I see what you doing there what I would
tweet that I'm here right now but I
think this is a no hashtag zone why if
you bought a thing
would you buy a really funny picture
looks like you is that what I look like
when I take a shower yeah that seems
accurate well you know I don't think
we're gonna find anything better than
this here so we should probably leave
now we get to play my favorite game
where's our car see if they didn't cheap
out and got a real parking lot with
signs wouldn't be here right now I have
idea I hear it keep pressing it's
getting louder do you hear it I think
we're close walking through the streets
of LA LA so cool walking through the
streets of LA walking through the
streets of LA walking through the
streets of LA walking through the
streets of LA hey let's eat here mohawk
Ben
wait so so is this this is all vegan so
a you're saying that this pepperoni is
not real and this cheese isn't real good
lord woman is this beer real brown -
here we go
I did not hit it it's did not
hit her I did not all right we need an
instant replay okay I might I might owe
you a new coffee and a new pickle you
all my pickle actually no you can't have
it now we're on the way to the movie
theater to go see Captain Marvel missin
Fred's wife is sauce and I are running
extremely late and to the crazy speeding
and stress look on wifey's face please
don't kill us how are we so late I was
taking a nap and then you woke me up and
then you're like did the lift ETA said
three minutes and then when I called it
it switched it to 15 he should have been
paying attention - then you should have
said honey never mind let's go right now
but it's gonna be wasted a few minutes
no I believe lift I'm blaming technology
very thing I swore to serve and protect
has become my worst enemy it says we'll
get there in five minutes four minutes
so eta is 339 the movie starts at 3:45
right and apparently the sphere if
you're late they won't let you in we are
forgetting about parking but I could
take some time so we might just be
getting in by the skin of our teeth oh I
know you guys couldn't feel it but wifey
sauce just slammed on the brakes pretty
hard please do not crash into the car
whose bumper sticker says safety is my
goal do not stop it stop breaking like
that I'm gonna squish the Totoro Wow Wow
you brought this on yourself your mother
made me do it should we run we probably
shouldn't run it might induce a bowel
movement I'm being you I beat you I beat
you of the series you suck you suck no I
can do whatever I want there are no
rules to the stair game loser made it
cool house closed now that we're here we
might as well get some beer where the
hell is it it's number five whoo I'm
pumped and I'm so glad I brought my
camera because I can record the whole
movie now
all right copyright got a cut now hello
little girl both my little girls sorry I
farted
my bad yeah I just know how to break up
a good moment okay it's the next day and
we're back in the office we actually
have some furniture to put together
because a lot of this office stuff as
you can see has nowhere to go so it's
still in boxes are just kind of strewn
about and we have some really nice
cabinetry that we bought it's not super
expensive but not super cheap either
we got this on Amazon I believe and
we're going to be putting it together so
we actually have a place for all this
stuff and we also have an Ikea desk
that'll be replacing this cheap fold-out
table that will be my sort of
benchmarking area with the various test
beds and things like that so right now
wifey sauce is actually moving all this
stuff into the dining room I'm gonna
help her as soon as I'm done vlogging
here so that we actually have space in
here to start building all of the
furniture so it should take a couple
hours but I think it'll be a lot nicer
in here once it's all done
okay we got the first base cabinet done
and it's looking pretty good pretty
straightforward definitely a cut above
IKEA instructions and quality but you
guys might have noticed that we did make
a mistake they actually have two sets of
holes on either door so that you can
make each door either a left or right
door we fail to notice that and drilled
holes in both sections so we actually
just completely damaged the front of our
brand-new base cabinet but that's okay
because its function function over form
right I'm a little less concerned about
the way vsauce is but we might try to
find something to cover this up if we
just get some like plastic white plugs
or maybe hit a nice bit with detail
sticker hey how about that so anyway
we're making good progress they want to
slow down right now so we're gonna
continue on with the side cabinets I
should probably just tell you the layout
right now so there's gonna be a side
cabinet here that's about the same width
as one of these doors another side
cabinet right here and then we're gonna
do some wall-mounted cabinets right
above so we're gonna have like you know
our printer and other office things here
and then it's just gonna be a storage
area for the office so that's where
right now let's carry on
the candidates are done well mostly you
can see that I've left the doors off of
one of the wall-mounted cabinets these
two at the top here those are going to
be mounted to the wall they're actually
gonna be elevated maybe a couple feet
above the base cabinets and at first we
were thinking that we were actually just
gonna have it sort of right where it is
against this wall in the middle that had
by benchmarking coroner over there but
then we thought it looks a little
awkward with just like so much stuff
this big glob of cabinetry just right in
the middle of the room so if we actually
measured it and found out that that
actually fits it's perfectly in the
little closet area here so we're
actually going to put in this little
recessed area where a closet used to be
before we tore it out and painted
everything so I think that's just gonna
look a little nicer and also open up
this whole wall for pretty much anything
else whether it be more storage why he
saw stepped out of the house but when
she gets back she can help me move all
this stuff over there and help me mount
these wall cabinets the way that these
wall cabinets work is you pretty much
just take a few three-inch wooden screws
and you screw right through these these
back panels into the studs in the wall
and the studs are spaced about 16 inches
apart so no problems there
mission complete looking pretty sad now
the plant and printer here just for
scale and we haven't put anything inside
the cabinets yet I'm not gonna bore you
with that but as I said it's pretty
perfectly with even some space on the
sides to spare looking pretty for dish
smashing I'm so glad that it fit here
because it just it really opens up this
room the room looks massive now whereas
it looked pretty cramped when the
cabinetry was right here it was really
just dwarfing the whole space I think
that's pretty much it for the video
let's see you it would do is us even
does what if you sauce have a comment on
our brand new cabinets horseshoe white
there we you oh it's messy in here don't
go in there where is she why does anyone
see my wife the bedroom of course of
course she's in the bedroom or maybe
she's not but hold she go no I know her
car still here you in the living room
boy have you seen the wife does she
leave me does she finally leave me what
do you mean she should have done that a
long time ago you're useless
on H outside the only room I haven't
looked in yet no closet nope okay I give
up free she tell me where your mom is
okay this is really weird
oh honey bear oh you oh my gosh are you
kidding me wow that took way too long
well I was kind of looking at the
viewfinder and the camera so I wasn't
really looking very well you see the
cabinets all done what do you think
looks good huh we did a great job whoo
now we get to put the majority of this
stuff in those cabinets that's for
another time though guys thank you for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
