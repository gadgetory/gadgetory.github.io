will be streamed I would guess - awesome
hardware what so again still need to do
a little bit of testing but what I'm
hoping I can have set up is that awesome
hardware will stream just a wide shot of
everything like both of us playing and
yeah we'll have our noiseless channel to
each version yeah just a multi-chain and
watch the whole scene that'd be really
fun to have to do a bandwidth to check
as well yeah some testing on our end but
so stay tuned for that should be very
fun that's pretty much the only
announcement we have other than that
we're still selling stuff on our stores
guys go ahead and pick up something from
Paul store or Mysore caster will do my

Johnson at you at the end of this half
the episode you'll be slightly if I had
and violated pullover hoodies on sale to
sell over hoodies go ahead and check
those out guys thank you any anything
that you can buy on our stores
definitely helps us out in building the
channel often stuff like that but let's
move on to some tech news starting with
a lighter topic here the subject of
Black Friday and Thanksgiving and how
that all went down in terms of sales
online sales just hitting record highs
the students or any readers did you buy
stuff we will get to that we'll get to
that but oh this is an article from
Reuters they're tracking all this shit
and they're saying that US retailers
pretty much saw some record sales online
for Black Friday and Thanksgiving this
is not well we'll get to cyber monday
later but this is just talking about
Black Friday and Thanksgiving guys seven
point nine billion dollars in online
sales billion that's up an insane
seventeen point nine for almost 18% from
just a year ago this is according to
Adobe Analytics which measures tred
transactions at the largest 100 US web
retailers this is cutting into the the
brick-and-mortar sales no this is just
online eight billion and online this
doesn't even include brick-and-mortar
which is insane I'm saying it's like if
the I I feel like I have picked up on a
trend in the past couple years of people
who were like I've hated Black Friday
like like brick-and-mortar shopping for
years like I'm just like why who doesn't
why would you subject yourself to that
why would you physically go somewhere
and pushed around like all the people
and they talk just look at people yeah
socialize
that's stupid so yeah sit at home and
shop like it's been like it makes so
much more sense to me oh yeah wider
variety you know my shopping and all
that kind of stuff so like my question
is like with first off people kind of
getting more disillusioned with the
in-person Black Friday sales and then
second with sort of the the dilution of
Black Friday like it's black November
now right sales - oh yeah two or three
weeks earlier so there's more people
gonna like go like a full week after yes
holding out their purchases or whatever
so I'm wondering if this this big boom
in online sales
can impact that might like if you're
looking at just brick-and-mortar sales
like those the same are they up a little
bit I would have to imagine as as online
shopping increases those those are fewer
people who are at the brick-and-mortar
stores right yeah I would have to
imagine that there's an adverse
correlation between online sales and
brick mortar sales versus Li
proportional yes inversely proportional
very very well said Paul um so I mean
even and this is interesting too this
just goes to show just how how like tech
savvy
I guess we're becoming are not tech
savvy or just tech reliant commerce
marketing firm kriti oh I don't know if
I'm pronouncing that right said 40
percent of Black Friday purchases were
made not just on desktop computers but
on mobile phones that's up 29% from last
year it's crazy like as soon as I think
like okay we've all all pretty much now
enveloped in the whole smartphone you
know phenomenon or whatever and we've
we've all sort of acclimated to just
using our smartphone with service for
everything then then some shit like this
comes out like holy crap like up 29%
from last year that's huge
more and more people are using their
phones for not just regular shopping but
just for like huge you know Black Friday
shopping and things like that
and find myself like checking out on my
phone much but I was like neither dude I
was like maybe like I kept I kept
hitting slick deals like damn it some
deals but like I can't be like maybe
there's something on slick deals that I
should buy right now because it's a
really good deal so I pulled up on my
phone and browse through it right and
there were two or three things that I
found on my phone but like I don't have
my logins like I don't have like my my
stuff plugged in there right Amazon done
but man so then I would take that then I
just go to my computer where the log
logins are set up and right I just my
thing is like well I have the computer I
can navigate the computer faster I can
navigate on a computer faster with a
mouse and keyboard typing searches and
stuff like that with the mouse and and
also I just feel like I get so paranoid
like if there's something what if
there's something really good that I
want there's like five left like I'm
gonna lose that on that if I'm using my
phone cuz it's 10 times slower think I
don't know how much you also have
awesome kick-ass desktops which most
people don't have most people don't even
have a desktop these days
they're lucky if they have a laptop most
people just use their phone for
everything and maybe phablet has an
extension who even has a freaking laptop
anymore unless you're in school or
something you know what I mean it's
crazy no it has laptops no I think I
think most people probably don't even
have a laptop I think most people don't
even have computers it's crazy
oh yeah well unless you're like talking
about a smartphone computer but yes no I
agree with you all the computers in our
or SOC s
but it's it's kind of interesting
because the biggest deals for Black
Friday this year were from TVs laptops
toys and gaming consoles three of those
three of those things are electronics so
I would imagine that at some point cyber
monday is going to overshadow Black
Friday just because as more and more
people buy online I feel like
electronics of the thing that we
gravitate towards most and here's some
information on cyber monday which also
saw some record sales at six point five
nine billion dollars slightly under what
Black Friday was able to pull but I I
would imagine that the Cyber Monday and
Black Friday gap is closing a lot
year-over-year to the point where I
think the cyber monday is didn't take
over personally because I think people
are just getting lazier and not just
lazier but smarter and saying like why
don't I just buy oh my shit online the
people who will figure that out the
fastest are people who are typically
more tech savvy than the than the norm
than most people and who are gonna be
interested in technology based products
anyways so this is also yeah it's super
annoying this is also a new record for
mobile phones on Black Friday
I'm sorry cyber monday reaching two
billion dollars Adobe analytics found
that 75% is kind of depressing found
that 75% of Millennials were more likely
to shop on their smart phones than on
their computers Millennials that's
that's like my generation that's why I
don't trust Millennials which is is sad
because I would never imagine that
shopping on my smartphone is more
to my desktop hell no but just goes to
show like just where the trends going
like PC PCs are getting phased out
computers in general laptops and stuff
getting phased out for smaller more
convenient more carry on you 24/7
screens and devices the top-selling
items here included Google chromecast
s-- Roku devices Apple iPad Samsung
tablets Apple earpods and Sony
PlayStation VR headset core systems as
you know the sony sony actually sold
more VR headsets than than any other any
other outlets like um vive HTC vive or
oculus rift
you mean like overall now just just from
black holidays yeah just for like the
last week or so which makes sense
because if you've already got a
playstation if you have a crazy deal on
a Playstation 4 or Playstation 4 Pro
might as well get the hmd because you've
already got the system to drive it right
as opposed to like okay yeah you cut the
pricing for the oculus rift in half
great I still need $1000 plus system to
run that to drive it effectively so
makes sense PlayStation VR has been
crushing it a bit best-selling video
game Super Mario Odyssey I got to play
that I got it I got at least try it
everyone had raving about I'm like okay
okay that was a huge fan of Super Mario
64
back in 1860 but you can't scream it
right uh-huh
I mean I mean you can if you know if you
want a Nintendo to claim all your all
your monies I mean I don't make money
from streaming anyway so I don't know if
it's a principle thing I agree I agree
many struggles here at with a Nintendo
streaming that's the topic for another
video and then we've also got the Xbox
one X was the oh the Xbox one X and then
the Nintendo switch of course we're the
most popular consoles sold over cyber
monday just as a sobering fact here if
you think that is a lot of money being
spent here in America with seven overset
almost eight billion on Black Friday
another 7 billion for cyber monday
alibaba's
fools day Holly Bubba's singles it which
is a really weird name
that's actually a predominantly Chinese
holiday that was invented by the
e-tailer Alibaba which i think is on
November 11th that day raked in twenty
five point three billion dollars this
month which is bigger than our United
States Black Friday and Cyber Monday
combined so um yeah we're yeah we're
people you have to you have to consider
also that there's a lot more people in
China way of course but I mean so but
you're right but still that's not for me
it's insane Wow uh so all right so what
did you get for Black Friday or Cyber
Monday what did you buy did you buy
anything
yeah about several thing I know about
some stuff what'd you buy also share
with the class I bought I bought the 43
inch Dell 4k monitor mmm because it was
on it was on Amazon
lightning deal for $650 what's it
usually go for only a thousand eight
hundred is up cheapest has ever been
yeah but typically I think that I heard
so yeah and it's it's a forty three inch
4k monitor and I was like so big and
it's 4k and then Windell and at level
one texts I wonder what Ryan did a
review of it so I wouldn't watch that
and they're very complimentary of it and
yeah and all that kind of thing so I was
like alright I'm gonna I'm gonna do it
cuz right now on my main editing system
I have a 4k monitor and 2560 by 1600
all right complete about this I think
before it resizes the windows all the
time yeah dad and I just went for to 4k
side-by-side I think it'd be better I'm
just super nice yeah so yeah but it's so
huge I finally I ordered it and then
like the day later like went and
actually measured with the thing like
all right well how big is 43 inches
gonna be there's no way I'm fitting two
monitors side by side let's just you
know its way to you these days
there's no way at all so basically you
have to be like five feet away
yeah so I'm getting really I'm giving it
to my wife so she's she's gonna use that
monitor all right and as a sitting one
as a single as a single all right see
how that works and if she can get
herself far enough back from it and
everything yeah and then I went and
ordered a different 4k monitor Oh which
is much more reasonably priced it's an
LG and 32 inch because I wanted the
exact same size and and resolution that
I already have as years I was gonna get
another I have an Asus Zeus yeah PA
three to eight and three to whatever
yeah yeah and that's what we have in the
other room maybe so I was gonna get
another one of those but they're like 9
900 950 ish and the refurbs that were on
offer I got my refurb one for 700 P PA 3
to 8 q I believe that's it yeah yeah so
yeah yeah oh really 927 it's a really
nice monitor but I was like man I feel
bad paying more now for another refurb
than I did back when I first got this
refurb on Black Friday so I started
looking at other options LG has a
32-inch it's not true 10-bit its 8-bit
plus plus some dithering or something in
there that gives it the 1.07 billion
colors but it was 370 370 quart 32 inch
4k awesome LG monitor with very very
positive customer feedback and
everything like that so that was a bnh
that I got that everywhere else nice 400
or more yeah I didn't check being a
small yeah that'd have been a good
source yeah I was I was all set to like
buy it for 400 and then I was like maybe
I should check around didn't be at it
for 370 so yeah free shipping beautiful
nice so those are the two main things
you got I got it I mean I could go on
I'm gonna do a whole video and unbox it
all be nice I gotta wait a few more days
I got a UPS again uh-huh Black Friday's
really good time to get a UPS are they
super dirty like usually like a like a
mid-range one is about a hundred and one
hundred 220 and usually can find them
for 7080 oh yeah that's pretty and then
the higher end ones are usually 180 to
200 ooh the one I got
it was yeah I was like a hundred and ten
or something like that's pretty good
yeah it was very nice discount on that
night I wanted a UPS for the garage I
have one for the computer room but I
want one on the garage dude yeah very
very fast Congrats sounds like yeah you
had some good stuff oh you got I don't
know there's some construction going or
there's a new tenant somewhere the
building that's like either directly
above us or to the left and they're
making lots of noise it's very
distracting sorry if you guys are
hearing that you got an R yeah hey
that's a great camera I love mine I know
it's it's literally the best the only
problem with it is that it overheats at
4k 4k you got the mark-5 and that's just
that's that's really like when that come
out the rx100 that was Jay's been like
forever there's a mark to mark three
mark for mark 5 mark 5 is within the
past once a year I think yeah yeah I
have a merc life because I'm two
generations after my mark 3 yes okay cuz
you hit the mark City yeah yeah that's
good but it overheats a 4k mainly for
vlogging and stuff yeah and shirt shirt
don't say yeah they're gonna love it
yeah amazing x1 I've I've had for three
years now and it's uh it's starting to
show some wear and tear
oh yeah plus the auto focus on that is
way but that's the only reason why I
upgraded from the mark 3 is because the
auto focus was the bane it sucked
yeah it was seeking constantly and it
was really bad for vlogging turned out
but the mark 5 fixed all that and it's
super quick and just seamless you're
gonna love it
um alright so let's move on to our next
article here which is about two HDMI 2.1
this is a new specification that
supports a lot of good stuff which we'll
be talking about shortly video cards
dot-com thank you for the article
apparently report oh tech report I don't
know I don't know I have video cards
don't come here those type of sorry is
clearly a tech report yeah yeah no I
have no idea why have I got switched
around I've been messing with links all
right so what basically the long short
here is that what do we
we care about what this supports what
kind of resolutions what kind of refresh
rates are we gonna be able to score away
with with this new standard so first off
we've got a bandwidth increase of 48
gigabits per second this is it's gonna
require a new HDMI cable so if you have
an existing HDMI cable for your HDMI
Chitti 2.0 version it's not gonna work
you're gonna need an ultra-high speed
HDMI cable
but with that cable you'll be able to
achieve resolutions of a k8k at 60 Hertz
for 4k at 120 Hertz we're gonna be some
getting some gaming monitors featuring
those specs pretty soon or a resolution
of up to 10 K holy crap for commercial
AV and industrial specialty usages which
is probably more niche there's also
gonna be support for dynamic HDR for
additional depth detail brightness color
gam and that sort of thing we're also
going to be seeing exceptionally low EMI
or electromagnetic interference with
this super speed HDMI cable and that's
basically going to help us sort of
reduce the nearby wireless device
interference to create a cleaner signal
backwards-compatibility I think this is
in regards to the actual cable the the
sort of cable that's not required you
could use that cable to connect you know
hdmi 2.0 and older devices so it's the
same physical plug same physical plug
saying you know city exactly the same
same sort of shape and stuff and there's
a number of refresh rate features for
seamless motion and smoother playback
which you can you guys can read about on
the article straight yes yeah yeah lots
lots of refresh rate features and
there's also the HDMI 2.0 R I'm sorry
2.1 compliance test specification
that'll be published in stages during q1
and q3 of next year apparently the the
way the way that you get access to hdmi
2.1 for now if you guys read the the FAQ
or the faq i think you have to be like a
hdmi 2.0 adopter and you need to like
sign up from like i don't know from a
site or something like that it's it's
not exactly clear although wait there
was no other art like what happened to
the there was a video cards article that
i had video card hdmi 2.1 yeah it was
right here when they had a fact they had
a really useful faq on actually whoever
wrote the article
oh yeah general facts here we go um how
do you license how do you actually
license hdmi 2.1 and that spec in order
to license that you actually need to
first become an hdmi adopter and then
sign an addendum to the hdmi adopted
agreement which provides you the license
for the hdmi 2.1 specification at that
point you should be able to download the
hdmi 2.1 spec off of the hdmi adopter
extranet extranet extra net for extra
net notification god has read the
article I think the one from video cards
I also you have no idea how to protect
report coordinate the extranet is a
backup of the Internet
yes it's a it's what we'll all be using
once the Neutrality dies is it's like
it's like oh crap the internet like it
got corrupted it was like don't worry
we've got an extra got an extra net it's
not in ER but it is extra so fun that I
don't know I think that was the biggest
limitation of 4k gaming or honestly was
that you're still bottlenecked by 60
Hertz I feel like I personally have been
spoiled by hyper 60 Hertz panels gaming
on the x34 predator and stuff I feel
like 100 Hertz is like now like I can
see the difference I can feel the
difference between 60 and hundred Hertz
and if you really want 4k
I don't think 60 Hertz is gonna cut it
it's like yeah you're you're pushing the
boundaries of how many pixels you're
pushing but at the same time you're
you're totally sacrificing the
smoothness of the overall experience so
this is sort of the best of both worlds
and you know it's kind of like
yeah I'll save I'll save the rest for
later but exciting hdmi 2.0 is upon us
that why are you pushing the boundaries
of too many pixels Kyle of course not
happy pixel harassment HP many you guys
have probably already heard about this
HP has stealthily installed a new
spyware called
HP touchpoint analytics client this is
from computer world calm sounds benign
Oh totally no I don't like as all
spyware would have you believe Paul HP
is installing a telemetry client on its
customers computers with zero
notification or request of user
permission cool so it's like so Europe
it's like super fish all over again
basically basically yeah this is going
by the name of HP touchpoint analytic
service and HP is saying that it
harvests telemetry information that's
used by their touch points and a little
excuse me analytical services there have
been reports of this infection dating
back to November 15th of this year just
a couple weeks ago where one user
FML user on bleeping computer comm
stated that he noticed the software had
been installed immediately after his
after this month's Windows updates
rolled out so holy crap this is involved
its Microsoft mic aside a proponent of
this it's unclear it's unclear if the
software came bundled with the official
Windows cumulative updates and or
monthly rollouts roll-ups and or the
security only updates like we don't roll
up delicious or that's being downloaded
by HP's own support assistant routines
either way HP customers are pissed and
rightfully so should be this is there's
been no official word as far like the
time of reading this article there's
been no official word from HP their
official touch HP touchpoint manager
website says and I quote the HP
touchpoint manager technology is now
being delivered as a part of HP device
as a service or das analytics and
proactive management capabilities
therefore HP is discontinuing these self
managed HP touchpoint manager solution
and the article didn't really say
anything about this but to me it sounds
like these little keywords that I'm
pointing out here
we're discontinuing the self-managed
portion and we're now delivering the
proactive management it sounds like
they're saying we're just installing
this on your computer ourselves without
your knowledge or permission HP wants to
touch your point and it's spyware so
it's basically accessing and sending out
or transmitting data that's accessing
data from your drive from your hard
drive from your SSD and it's putting it
somewhere else it doesn't belong it's
not it's no longer local which is scary
and stupid and evil Martin Brinkman on G
hax has a thorough accounting of the
spyware how exactly to remove it
step-by-step
thank you very much Martin for providing
this for any user who's been affected by
this awful awful software so guys go
ahead and check that out if you happen
to have an HP device or have noticed
that this suspicious software has been
installed because it is indeed spyware
it was even actually popping up on
people's like Kaspersky and other
antivirus softwares as like hey this is
a red flag this is not good and of
course HP is writing it off as like hey
this is to help protect and serve you
and as a user we love you we need we
want to give you better ads don't you
want better ads we want it we want the
best ads that that all tailored for you
cuz that's what people want
get your ad on I don't hate ads and find
them annoying
I just want good ads their ads for me
check out this amazing and um that's
gonna be a so um I hope each I mean it
sucks because like like I said it's
super fish-like superfish lenovo did
this and they freaking did it again
after it was discovered like I used to
recommend Lenovo all the time to people
until until super fish in that Patil it
like don't take advantage of your
customers don't really stupid nonsense
to harvest data without asking the
and the shitty thing is that HP and like
exactly the same thing like now it's
like ah God you feel conflicted because
Lenovo does make some pretty bomb ass
products but then you feel like you
shouldn't recommend them because they
pull shady shit like this yeah same with
HP HP has some really good products even
now for example our next article is
about their HP Envy x-360 15 notebook
which is one of the first ever to
feature the mobile rise in quad-core
chip the i-5 I'm sorry the rise in 5
2500 view and the integrated GPU which
is the RX Vega 8 it's an HP laptop and
it performs great according to this
article that we're about to talk about
but it like I said when HP or big
companies like this pull shady shit it
makes it really hard for influencers or
reviewers or whatever the fuck you want
to call us to recommend their products
so it's a it's you know we're kind of
ambivalent here but anyway let's talk
about the hardware the Rison 5 2500 view
is one of the first rise and mobile
chips on the market that you can
purchase and it's got some ballin
integrated graphics the Sena bench ar-15
scores for this 2500 you were basically
identical to Intel's mobile a core i5
8282 50 you in both single and multi
threaded performance to be fair the
single threaded marks for for the for
the Intel chip we're about six percent
higher than than Rison but still very
neck-and-neck okay cool it competes with
with Intel it's pretty much the same
cool equal great but why in the 3dmark
Elevens test Elevens I don't know I say
Elevens in the 3d mark 11 test the
horizon 5 2500 you performed 91 percent
better than the Core i5
8250 use until you HD graphics because
you know it still sucks all the Intel HD
graphics still pretty much suck am i
blind here where this was so if you look
at the 8250 you there oh there it is
yeah yeah and if he it's cool because I
want to do this if you highlight that it
tells you what the percentages
Tyl of how much better another CPU or
system is so holy crap 91 percent better
than the the i-5 8250 you and it's you
HD graphics and this was in the combined
test but when you switch over to just
the GPU bound test the risin 5 performed
118 percent better than the equivalent
Intel chip which is pretty awesome the
2500 you also significantly had more
performance per watt which was I should
mention that this is also from notebook
check net sorry notebook notebook
notebook check dotnet kind of a mouthful
but they also found that some really
good performance per watt for this risin
five mobile chip it was far less
demanding than the i7 7500 you but with
roughly a 50% boost in multi-threaded
CPU performance and 20% boost in GPU
performance that's actually pretty good
performance for what was even more
impressive when when compared to Amy's
own rx 460 I believe that and if you
wanted to compare this integrated
graphics chip to discrete GPUs that are
currently on the market the risin 5 2500
you Falls pretty much midway between the
maxwell geforce 940 MX and the pascal
geforce MX 150 which granted they're
pretty low-end like they're pretty much
as low end as it gets when it comes to
graphics cards they are below like the
GTX 10 1550 I obviously but they're
still discrete GPUs they still have like
heat sinks on them with like full pcs
PCBs they're separate entities the fact
that AMD has been able to integrate this
type of performance into a apu I would
call it is pretty impressive and also
the fact that the 2500 U is a risin 5
chip we still have not caught wind of a
rise in seven mobile chip that will what
I would assume have even better
integrated graphics built in so very
exciting this basically
puts intel in the situation where they
finally have some competition in the
mobile market where they yeah that they
honestly it's been so long like we had
ultrabooks those were a disaster like
god they're so expensive
and they're not very good but there's
nowhere else to go
if you want a really slim laptop that
does things other than like a MacBook
Air or some shit
so yay yay rise and yeah AMD
just to clarify there is a Asus laptop
of the RG Strix GL 702 ZC which has a
rise in 7 1700 and rx 580 in it oh it's
got 700 but that's not the APU it's ok
yes a separate CP sorry arise instead of
an APU yeah yes I misspoke sorry I mean
it was it's it's a it's a detail but you
I mean no it was the AP use right right
sure it was just when you said that eyes
might be used I was like wait I remember
a 1700 based laptop at Computex no yeah
I remember you talking about it recently
- um I thought you did and notebook 1x
to.net has an article on that - yeah no
no I completely misspoke I specifically
meant rise in ap use of course um but
yes that's super exciting the fact that
you I mean and obviously I would I would
imagine that you would even have better
thermals on an APU
would you then having a discrete GPU I
mean I guess it depends I guess it
depends but I believe the folks over at
notebook check net did not find any
thermal throttling of any kind I feel
like or I remember they they said in the
article that they ran the Cinebench
score or the Cinebench test twice the
first time it was you know obviously
spit out a number second time right
after it had like a 3% lower score
because you know at that point the CPU
had heated up a little bit and maybe
there's a little bit of throttling there
but I think they also tested an Intel
equivalent I forget this skew is gift my
memory right now but it actually dropped
like 30
like over 30% in that tests on the
second run just because it got so hot
that whatever cooling solution was in
the laptop just couldn't handle it so
the fact that we're dealing with power
efficiency on a mobile scale on mobile
level is huge I mean it's even more
significant I think than in a desktop
environment so really good you know sort
of a general generational leap for for
AMD on this one and definitely more
competition for all of us so yay let's
move on to the next article here
actually we've got one from ek water
blocks they made an announcement
recently of their mlc it's not
multi-level cell just don't get it
twisted
they're mlc or modular liquid cooler
their Phoenix the MLC Phoenix it's a
modular liquid liquid cooling line of
products this is an article from Tom's
Hardware Tom's Hardware I can't take it
rid of your garbage top this is a new
kid on the block see what I did there
this is replacing the ek xlc predator
series which I was very fond of I did
like the predator series very much that
was a refreshing change the somewhat
repeated and bland I was only saying
there's only so-so on the predator I
mean I think they were super expensive
but I did like the way they they they
performed and looked and stuff this
probably didn't spontaneously decide to
leak well in the story did not have any
experience with that as I agreed that
would have definitely made my opinion a
bit more salty but the new Phoenix
system is going to be improving the
brands modular AIO concept which they've
already sort of familiarized this with
it's going to have improved flexibility
however and easier configurability over
there
older predator series of AI O's now the
Phoenix gets the way that they work is
that well first off you guys are pretty
pretty familiar with how the predator
was right it was basically just a
self-contained AI oh yeah so you had a
pretty nice right on the end here that
had the pump right and and a block in it
which is all attached I'm sorry the pump
block is a separate unit down here of
course all attached to the radiator so
there's all fairly self-contained and
there was some
some compatibility issues depending on
the case that used it in because if you
looked at say the 240 model or the 360
model a case that was compatible with a
240 or 360 red might not have been
compatible at this just do the extra
bulk on the end but if you did have
compatibility it was a very nice all
like contained unit and they performed
yet pretty close to like what you would
get out of like an actual custom liquid
cooling loop yeah so that was really
cool literally but at the same time
we've also got so basically the way that
the predator series was the predator AO
is just kind of like an AO but just with
you know using EK products but this is
completely different this is a fully
modular system so everything in the
Fenix the Fenix kit or the Fenix system
is gonna be sold individually so you're
gonna buy the radiator module I'm gonna
call it a radiator module it's not
really just the radiator is it it's a
radiator and that kind of remains
unchanged from the predator series
they're still gonna have the radiator
with the integrated pump on attached to
it and the little PCB where you connect
the PWM fans and things like that PWM
control it's already integrated into the
radiator so that you've got the radiator
module sold separately that's
independently sold you get the water
blocks for your CPU those are sold
separately water blocks for your GPU
those are sold separately and then all
of these elements are prefilled and
terminated by the quick disconnects that
you see here so if you bought just the
radiator and pump unit you get this part
here and the tubing coming out of it
just quick disconnects that we're
disconnected correct and then you buy
correct okay and at that point so you
can you can decide instead of just
buying a predator AI oh that's just you
know it's okay you get it you get a
cooler for your CPU you could buy the
radiator and there's various sizes 120
240 360 140 or 280 you can buy the
radiator module and then let's say you
only want to cool your GPU then you just
buy a GPU block and then they have a
pretty wide variety of blocks available
at launch including the
gtx970 and 1080 founders editions nvidia
titan a number of adding board partner
cards as well as AMD RX vega 56 and 64
so you can pretty much just pick out
whatever parts of the loop you want and
you can add pretty much as many blocks
as you want to your loop you could add
two GPUs to GPU blocks and a CPU block
plus a couple radiators if you wanted to
you could pretty much build like the the
unto elite build that I'm putting
together with this modular system you
just kind of pick and choose wherever
the hell you want so whether or not this
is gonna catch on though is another
thing they kind of haven't really gone
mainstream with the whole idea of
modular custom liquid cooling or water
cooling but I guess this is their
attempt at trying to make that more you
know or that more widely available epic
in chat was asking first off do they
have Vegas 64 blocks for these yeah I
know EK has Vegas 64 blocks I'm not sure
if they're gonna sell them in this trim
but I would expect that they would
because yeah I mention the blocks yeah
oh you already said that MD execs and 64
blocks those are asking can you add
another module to the loop like another
radiator so if you wanted top 360 and
whatever and the answer would be yes as
well you're having two pumps in each in
a loop isn't isn't typically a problem
right yeah and this would eliminate any
new the the cool thing is that this
eliminates the need for a dedicated pump
because it's already built into the
radiator I think for ek this eliminates
the fact of them selling kits that are
specifically designed for a specific
configuration and they have to make a
bunch of those kits in order to actually
populate yeah like it so variety yeah
whereas the number of people looking for
that specific configuration is probably
more limited yeah here separating the
parts out they can sell them
individually they're all intercomparison
inter compatibility is just the quick
disconnects right and then buy whatever
block you need buy whatever right GPU
and here's here's my theory on why this
isn't going to catch on main stream wise
is because people who are looking to
fully deck out their systems with custom
liquid cooling aren't
for the most part aren't trying to just
get really really low temperatures
they're trying to like make their system
look badass as hell and they're trying
to they're trying to diversify and
they're doing it for the experience and
for the aesthetics in my opinion when
they're creating a custom loop and I
feel like this takes all of that out of
the equation it's gonna look like any
other system there's nothing unique or
fancy or pretty about this in fact it
kind of looks weird with the QD C's and
no one's gonna spend $400 on this the
way it's looking with with zero
customization or unique factor or style
points it's all about style points I
mean look at RGB RGB sells and
everyone's doing it because it's selling
talk shit on it as much as you want
people want it to look good and at the
rates that ek is charging a hundred and
seventy dollars for just the radiator
seventy two dollars from the CPU
waterblock and a hundred and forty nine
dollars for the GPU block and that's
where that that's where all these prices
are starting folks it's gonna go up from
there know people people who really just
want it like cooler CP others gonna buy
an AO there's gonna buy something that's
you know 100 bucks 120 bucks and set it
and forget a type of thing this is my
personal opinion who knows I would love
ek to prove me wrong and for this to
just become like like like 90% of people
just have this in the rig but I don't
know so you I think you might be right I
think the counter to that would be if
you look at how popular all-in-one
liquid coolers are and if you combine
that with the fact that a lot of people
are interested in doing stuff like
custom loops but there's a lot of
intimidation factor when it comes to
actually doing stuff like connecting up
tubing and filling a loop and everything
like that if you can take the all-in-one
elements where everything is contained
and you don't have to worry about liquid
other than just connecting up some
disconnects and you have the efficiency
of liquid cooling which a lot of people
are interested in and potentially you
might have a limitation of some of the
like downsides to the all like too
cheaper on ones where there's a little
but higher instance of like pump failure
and leaks and that kind of thing like
the EK stuffs that they've made is
pretty solid all this being said the
caveat that I just pointed out that my
predator unit but yeah that being said I
believe I think I think there's a
naughty there there's there's a customer
I think there's customers who are
interested in this oh yeah I don't
necessarily care as much about the
aesthetics are there enough customers
for it to be a very popular thing that's
that's a good question I'm sure ei I'm
sorry I'm sorry
I'm sure whoa hey shots fired
ek hell are you wait a disome like that
Paul my bad my bad
yes a lot of ways but let's move on best
of luck to ek with whatever it went with
whatever they do with all the new
management stuff that's going on over
there but let's move on to pin my PC you
guys have been sudden you'll still up
all right let's see what you got Mon
stickit Mon Stokes malts dogs you sent
in a system that was featuring a Corsair
crystal case in ASU's prime X 370 Pro
rise in 1600 X of course different ins
3000 megahertz 16 gigs and an Tek six
and 21 gtx 1066 is your bike model and
SST no hard track
alright hyper 212 very mysterious
interesting I'm wondering if the fan
that's on your hyper 212 is set to push
or pull because of it set to push you're
technically going against the natural
airflow of your case I would think is
you're kind of confusing his with the
top fans fans those are also saying take
hopefully you have a dust filter up
there otherwise you can get really dirty
really fast it's very positive I'm not
gonna knock about shock positive
positive pressure in any way but I just
hope yes your t-shirts stay positive
burping so much I just hope you have a
yes stay positive I just hope you have a
dust filter up there at the very least
if you do then it makes a lot more sense
with that top fan on top year to 12 but
apart from that I'm personally a fan of
vertical towers not horizontal yeah
personal favorites
that I think I think getting a Corsair
red LED fan for your final exhaust fan
here would balance things out a little
bit
definitely and then as as is the case
with most systems a sleeved cable
extension kit for the 24 pin and your
graphics card power would would look
pretty nice here and clean things up
over all your cable management to this
quite tidy yeah it's looking pretty
clean so it's working for me
yeah just main questions are the
orientation of the fan fans here and I
know this is probably just me but like
the front fans your front your two front
intake fans how the Corsair sticker is
like one's vertical and one's horizontal
how does that bother that bothers me it
pings my OCD most people don't care but
fair enough
um alright but thank you very much mom
thank you mom next we got Jonathan he's
got a core i5 4570 with a cooler master
hyper 212 Evo an msi RX 484 gigabyte
with a gigabyte board on the z87
platform got a you d3h there the UV 3 Hz
I see eight gigs of HyperX fury 1600 and
let's see even just a modular PSU would
make this thing look so much better I
agree um holy crap yeah that's a lot of
like just like a spaghetti spaghetti
cables right there in front of your
power supply it's like a graveyard mmm
I'm seeing alright so if you're gonna do
any upgrades to the system advocates
adding a second stick of memory I think
would be first on your list just to give
yourself with adult recreational more
gigs of course yeah yeah get one more
stick in memory before anything else cuz
that's just functionally yeah totally
agree pull your yellow label off of your
damned Kahler for your cooler you don't
need that on there
flip your power supply granted you've
got a red LED fan in there so like I
mean I guess you're getting a little bit
of a thick view of that but then the
blood then again you've got the case
sitting on on carpet so I'm disappointed
I'm disappointed by that
don't flip this power supply if you're
going to but for God's sake you can get
your computer up off the carpet please
it should not be there it should be up
on a desk paul is triggered or it should
be on some sort of just something to get
it a good couple feet up off the floor
yeah
your cables down here I don't know what
you can do with those
you could probably push as many of them
back behind the cable management area as
possible weird yeah do all those things
and you'll have a much better case begin
can't you get your system on the floor I
agree yeah that's where I'm at
thank you John okay next up we've got
John Scott politics Joe Joe Joe Joe with
a core i7 5820k next x99 OSI formula got
16 gigs of DDR 4 from a data and a an
anthro great case of course RH 100 IV 2
and an msi r9 390 he plans on repainting
the red to gold once the warranty
expires it's really smart
that's actually the one I didn't read
the comment before I selected this for
pimp you seem that was like the one
thing I was gonna say is okay once you
paint the shroud gold is funny he's
waiting until the foreign digs I know
like I mean I mean he'll I mean I guess
you're sorry you're gonna paint that and
you can't return it if M I was wrong at
month 23 as a two-year warranty right
when it dot decides to rat on butts 23
and three weeks planned obsolescence and
the sign knows what they're doing okay
here's the deal
it's tough to pull off gold gold it's
tough to put the RAM in the motherboard
match perfectly
that's Joe I commend you on that I would
say spray paint the fan blades all gold
yeah I feel like go big or go home man
the old is lighter in your sales of
course there are TV fans though
there SP 120 RGB yeah just make a gold
color just perma gold it
there ain't no there ain't no like vans
that only do gold point is RGB LEDs
there because there are no fans that
only but have you ever seen just like a
gold like a gold fan they need to make
that that's why our GB exists is because
it's the RGB isn't there just just so
you can do colors of the rainbow 24/7
they're also there in case you were
looking for a specific or a sort of
unique color scheme that is only
achievable with the option of having
16.8 million colors it's difficult to
tell but are these two fans here painted
gold it's kind of it kinda looks like
they might be I don't know you're right
it's either their white blades that are
kind of picking up some of the gold hue
of the rest of the system or maybe these
are maybe he painted those I mean I can
looks pretty good I mean it looks like
they match your cables pretty nicely if
it's not just some weird artifact of the
photo if that's the case I would
spray-paint the other my ears in color
here's my main complaint here cuz you've
already said you're gonna repaint the
gold that's fine nor you paint the red
to gold that's fine your cable
extensions are bronze mm-hmm everything
else is gold I agree that's gold
if I'm in a matter of opinion that's
dragoness this is two different colors
yeah so I hate to say it but I feel like
your cable extensions are not matching
doing a service to this build right I'd
rather see all black yep or something
that's a lot lighter that that matches
with the rest of this a little bit you
probably get like a nice spray paint
like a gold flake spray paint and make
it match really nicely if you want to go
that extra it would be kind of a or you
could probably just seek out a company
like you know woz mods check out woz
mods yeah waz z mo d Escom believe he
does some great extensions and cabling
like that i don't know if he has gold
but you can check him out and source to
some really great work mainframe customs
those guys those big guys who do
sleeving
will have more options for unique color
customization potentially look
two gold sleeping options because I
think that's a really huge area where
we're lacking here also take off that
sticker off of that freaking IO
your rear i/o what is that cloud as rock
cloud as rock cloud sticker or you can
just model the new egg TV golden bill
that Paul and I did back in 2012 that
was six years ago look at this this is
us six years ago five years ago five
I can't count this is a classic classic
video about to be sick diseased 77
motherboard we custom painted the GTX
680 this is 686 70 I'm sorry how many
custom yeah that yeah wow we help plane
that GPU looks and 3770k and 70 K yeah
sure oh yeah three to four horse all the
old all the first like original SS look
at my video every every showing is just
wearing a t-shirt and then as the video
progresses I sneakily add more and more
bling now he's got our gold ring on it's
like wait he didn't have it in the last
shot yeah
what is he gonna have it little chain
yes there we go oh that deck that
Corsair case though this 600 T was
baller how the six out of T custom
English so nice that was a really good
paint job from the guys that of course
here used so if you want if you want to
go gold and sand and that shit ECS me
you've got a high standard so now Kyle
is this is really the gold standard for
gold build up I love how it's like darts
with just as a crop in like it's super
zoomed in yeah you're like wait is he
really yeah
[Laughter]
how many hands does it take to screw in
a CPU cooler and then look how young you
look I look young I don't know you I
don't you look the same but yours very
my beard out there you can tell ya I be
a great where's Kyle I come out sound I
kind of at some point all right now get
the coat I get I get that and I got I
actually have a new necklace this pimp
on it I just throw you some zip ties and
I walk away and go back to pimping
pimping needs attendant to that was the
really nice like a golden and there's
something hanging from this video
quarter million views it's not bad oh
I'm bad only 76 dislike you realize you
realize it now make money in the
chalices this piece what do I says if BC
soap if even I owe a bit of a case cord
no shit J give it to yourself J gosh I
love a J all right
classic golden build bicycle mill bit of
a sidetrack there yep
you know we just did we just basically
did a react video we can't middle of our
next one from we just did Joe right yeah
we got Rob Rob Rob faster bit with the
gtx 970m the all right what do we got
here Hey all right it's really clean the
impression is super clean tables
obviously immediate follow-up is yeah
ketchup mustard pitcher master cables um
but you know if you just got a power
supply that had all black cables they
wouldn't necessarily need to be like
sleeved or anything I think for a budget
all right a system on this caliber of
this caliber I think just a regular you
know black wire like the ones you have
your your GPU look fine
for this no one's expecting you to have
beautifully sleeved cables
professionally done in a system like
this the other thing I'll say though is
that I wish the mother board PCB wasn't
brown yeah it kind of makes it stand out
a bit a little bit but yeah like the
only thing the only thing I really
really want is just a 24-pin extension
and then everything is is looking
perfect and clean as far as the build
itself goes yeah wouldn't change much um
you're still at that point where like
improving your hardware is more
important than aesthetics well very much
Robin next finally we've got Andrew
Andrew with an AMD r5 1600 at 3.8
gigahertz you've got an as rocket a e350
Pro before motherboard and besides gtx
980ti
armor 2x eina of course okay what do we
got um okay ketchup and mustard
obviously again this is one of those
systems that's more on the budget side
of things so I would I would say upgrade
your core hardware I think the rise in
1600 is great as is the graphics card I
mean you have a gtx 980ti actually
you're doing pretty good here honestly I
feel like what is this case DIY it's a
DIY okay I feel like that's your
limiting factors that's the thing that I
hate the most does yeah yeah everything
I like looking at your heart like okay
I'm assuming that your CPU or GPU is
crap no those are both really good it's
just your case I have had D values the
overall negative experiences with DIY if
you see in the past those Oh bye so
that's to be considered yeah yeah um no
guys forgive me in chat it's not a
budget I thought it was a budget from
looking at I mean you would think that
its budget from looking at it but it's
not it's a budget it looks like a super
budget case and oftentimes the case
alone can make an entire system look
like it's pretty cheap it's a system
where the actual internal majority of
the investment has been made into the
parts that make a difference so I
completely makes components and nati a
flare x-kid of 3200 speed memory which
is a very nice pairing for the
CPU and you've got a budget case a
fairly budget power supply a fairly
budget motherboard the a B 350 per for
is a nice performer in the be 350
category though it's actually got
reasonable power delivery and cooling so
you can get a reasonable overclock out
of it hence the 1600 at 3.8 gigahertz so
yeah it's just the case the case is
cheap I parrot the power supply is cheap
and has ketchup and mustard cables I bet
those Thermaltake ring fans at your
intake are worth more than the entire
case you're probably right about that
when we surprised go for the case you
have a you have a very powerful system
there's a couple things that could make
it look a little bit cleaner
cable extensions that kind of thing but
I can definitely appreciate that the
money here has been invested in the
performance of the system more so than
the looks of the system indeed um so
thank you very much for everyone who
submitted to pit my PC will be doing
this again in the future so if you think
I picked this time don't be too sad I
say we skip say yes good I will say that
for next time
let's just dive right into some Q and Q
yeah yeah wait not you get where the
cutoff is oh here we go
they're really are here for before your
have stood easy to do and yeah we did
let's see do we do our Clardy I think
there were a couple more before before
you're having our clarity for the 10
bucks rise in five 1500 X asrock xb-70
oh wait no we did that when I ready
total rage did we do that one yes we did
that too all right Tyler Joby five
dollars i got an msi z 370 gaming pro
carbon with an ASA i7 8700 K and the GT
X 1080 founders Edition would it be
worth getting a third-party card with a
bigger cooler or another EFI founder
position and that's a lot third party
card with a bigger cooler what does he
mean oh oh just like a different cards
figures with you before you did that I'd
rather sell your 1080 founders Edition
and get a 1080 TI yeah and then you'd be
good at so an admin board partner custom
OEM yeah I'd rather have a single 1080i
than there's lots of good third-party
versions of that
I'm 10 18s Eliza yeah yeah David Taylor
Neil levy 10 bucks I upgraded a 6700 K
dueled 980ti
to 7700 K dual not 1080 TI to use the
same GA or gigabyte z170 g1 motherboard
being last cpu for this motherboard when
should I upgrade to a new chipset / CPU
for blender workloads and mostly gimme
see you throw that blender workloads in
there and it uses things if you're if
you're saying mostly gaming it say
you're set for probably at least another
year or two
mm-hmm give or take depending on how you
know your cutting edge you want to be
and that kind of thing thrown blender
workloads though and I'm like alright
7700 K you're fine for that but there's
definitely better available yes oh yeah
and done how much of an increase you
need in performance but yeah I'd save by
and large with your setup you're totally
good for right now
totally good yeah and just sort of see
what 2018 brings when it comes to what
CPUs are available and and also how
significance how important the rendering
those blender workloads are quickly to
is yeah like if it's not a big deal if
you set them to go like as you go to bed
and like you don't worry so much about
shaving a few seconds off every time
then maybe that's also if you want to
take it to the next level with the
workstation stuff and blender workloads
I would suggest strangle a from
mainstream because the only worthy
upgrade in my opinion from a 7700 K
would be going like thread over okay
like a 1900 X or something yeah I mean
this stuff right we already talked about
earlier in the show like the 8 core
potential main stream platform stuff
that might come out next year could be a
good upgrade for you but yeah it's
really the blender stuff how important
is that to you to do that faster and is
it gonna be worth it investing in a
high-end desktop configuration for it
but again for now particularly for
gaming you're totally golden Cheez Whiz
she's with us the graphene balls are
likely nanoparticles that have a higher
surface area allowing more coating per
volume given greater
capacity etc I like that we're just like
making like nut second ball puns and
things like giving us a really
scientific explanation which makes sense
I mean balls I mean that's why they put
you know like the shaved shaved ice
balls like hand-carved ice balls inside
of like really fancy cocktail drinks
because it actually decreases the amount
or I'm sorry increases the amount what's
the maximum amount of surface area to
the water surrounding it so yeah there
you go
all right thank you Cheez Whiz that
sounds reasonable yep for $50 hey Kyle
for finally being a good boy wifey sauce
told me you finally took her out to
dinner
yes I did super nice but there is still
the issue about you removing your
wedding ring punishment for that pending
oh yeah I watch that what I watched that
you watch me twice hilarious I remove my
wedding ring was LAT was it that last
week or the week before on what when
your wedding ring disappeared it did and
you were like bit like oh my gosh like
there's no way that this could have
happened whatever blah blah that it's
gone on the shit on stream and then all
you had to do is look back in the stream
like 20 or 25 minutes earlier and you're
sitting there like I'm gonna take off my
wedding ring and like whatever is I
could save yeah I lost my ring on stream
that's what happened yeah I need to
watch the video back Louis thanks Fred
freak a medley Josh Wallace $5 love the
show you guys also need to move to
Chattanooga Tennessee beta dot speedtest
net result is just a link last place
immune to net neutrality we also have
10-gig oh nice okay good old Chattanooga
that was on my bucket list is to always
Chattanooga choo-choo they live in
Chattanooga sweet Thank You Josh advice
Josh pair a sloths 10 bucks I don't
usually get to see the show live love
watching you too less of a technician
more of an editing one have you heard of
light works what do you use also what
are your degrees in I've never light
works I don't know is that
program no I don't think so I use we
both use Adobe Premiere Pro CC Creative
Cloud my degrees in multimedia
production management which I guess in
some way I am using this day light works
as a nonlinear video editor I've never
heard of it yeah neither mine that is
interesting it's been used wolf of
wallstreet LA Confidential pulp fiction
heat Road to Perdition Hugo King speech
and many more I haven't used light works
most of my experience as Kyle mentioned
is with premiere when I was going
through film school which I did briefly
many years ago I briefly with avid and
beyond that of course just Final Cut Pro
those are the three those are kind of
the three main ones that I'm familiar
I mean then then there's the the kind of
more less expensive kind of entry living
it's like Vegas
yeah you know and those kind of things
but yeah light works time first I've
heard of it so just Premiere Pro it's
like 50 bucks a month or even less than
that like 30 bucks a month if you're
just light works definitely seems like
it's on the high end like I mean if it's
been used for feature for for futureland
length motion picture production but
maybe they just I was skeptical about
that sort of thing like this was used on
this movie like okay but in what
capacity pulp fiction like no yeah but I
mean like okay we used it to added
special transition or something like
okay like how like a we used it for like
one percent of the movie but it was
still it's still technically can okay
but just the fact that I've never heard
of it makes me a little skeptical I know
the big the big to industry is saying
light works as a free version as a free
version so I want to check that if
you're on a budget I just know that the
two big industry standards right now are
avid and Adobe Premiere Pro Final Cut
definitely used to be in the running and
sort of falling back after a couple
changes to the software and stuff
depends who you talk to
Penza you talk to I guess Final Cut does
have some pretty nice good reason it
shrimps taking advantage of Intel Quick
Sync mm-hmm because it encodes real time
while you're in the timeline and stuff
rendering right or editing
that's pretty so it renders so when when
when you're rendering in a format that
is quicks incompatible h.264 or h.265
but your CPUs background then it's
pretty and sanely fast yeah if you're
not doing those specific codecs that
it's hardware designed for then you're
operating a new piece so you feel like
Adobe Premiere Pro could easily do that
if it just took advantage of quicks I
don't quite understand why Adobe hasn't
like why don't they do that developed as
nothing it's nothing specific to Apple
yeah anyway Chris with the five dollar
donation is my friend is live on twitch
running a PC giveaway would be cool to
Radium when y'all are done coalition
gaming crew either way you guys Rock
thank you Chris we haven't been getting
a few more comments with donations
asking us specifically to raid specific
people and while we are not opposed to
that we certainly cannot promise
anything
typically the raid is chosen by cell yep
use the chooser and yeah so that's kind
of how you end and all liability but
good luck to your friend either way it
sounds fun giveaways are good at the
very least go ahead and check out
coalition gaming crew on Twitch if
you're interested in a PC giveaway zoz
no schemer $5 no comment oh no sorry
there was a comment 67 K or 70 700 K I
have an i-5 6500 and a gtx 1070
wondering which to choose for 144 fruits
gaming the 700 K will be faster yeah by
a bit valid only go for the 6700 K if it
was significantly reduced you Christ
over the 7700 K yeah if it's a $20
difference then go for the Saudi 700 K
but they're very very comparable at the
same frequency oh yeah they're the same
CPU yeah
Zizi are Hardy with the $10 Australian
when you guys play playing pew BG our
Peter player knows battle guys q so I
can stream smooth view is easier Hardy
definitely summer night December nights
will probably play that for at least a
little bit maybe just the whole time
just 12 hour
Claire knows better Oh probably mixing
dingo on my 40 with the $10 donation is
he gonna explain to us what his name
means like favorite games Sega Dreamcast
Gundam Side Story white bingo squad mm
favorite movie Friday Oh 1995 Deebo what
you got on my 40 the stranded Seinfeld
homie 1991 then counter-strike 2012
online so this is a mishmash of several
different pop-culture references that's
something to you and you a Dreamcast
Gundam Side Story white dingo squad is
where dingo comes from and then 2000
favorite favorite movie Friday 1995 debo
what you got on my 40 is where the 40
the on my 40 comes
oh that's from Friday is that what debo
is a line that debo says I think so yeah
all right yeah I remember debo you cut
him up what you got on my 40 sounds like
something you would say Fridays is is
there's a lot of fun yes the the sequel
movie sequels are so horrible though
I've never seen the sequels don't
intention to return well I'm glad we
have an explanation now dinkle on my 40
thank you for that all right
whitey was a $10 donation kappa love
both channels and used them entirely to
go from 0% pc knowledge to giving my
friends build advice nice thanks for
great content hopefully I can get him
put by PC when my build is done
submitted send it in why it's ready wait
for that proper time on a Tuesday when
Cal tweets
yes Fred rant $5 Congrats the Paul for
having 43 inches to give his wife there
we go
you too man cheers Fred cheese cheese
hmm Christopher wolf $5 i seven at four
point three gigahertz with an h 100 I
pushed pull not to a fans Corsair cube
case
Maximus six extreme can I bit mine with
my old 660ti for the win 3G and GTX 1080
at the same time you should be able to
from my understanding
yeah they don't need to get all the same
GPU right doesn't need a bit same GPU
anything like that as long as they're
plugged in and powered you should be
able to mine with them just fine
yep but my hands-on experience with that
is limited so great Chris so Leigh's ten
dollars big fan of both your channels
thank you for the answer
GX 970 upgrade alright you are very
welcome but it all works out for you
Stephen Hill what up sue Bruin take
Steve $10 as usual thanks for the
content but I actually have a question
this time how do different capture cards
cope with ultra wide and does refresh
rate take a hit with different
configurations your fresh rate would be
limited by the capture card because
capture cards are typically limited to a
specific amount of bandwidth which is
going to be resolution x frame rate
Walter White's not supported by my extra
core my ultra wide experience has been
nil I've had zero they don't they don't
have success in taking it like a 34 40
by 1440 signal even with a fork a
capture card which should have the like
resolution bandwidth capability to
handle it's alright might be a software
issue might be otherwise I think it's
probably because there aren't many
sources online where you can watch full
widescreen or ultra wide content so
there haven't been many companies or
manufacturers who have actually
manufactured capture cards capable of
that sort of resolution so well they
tried a couple those so I'm sure it's
something that is possible and maybe
something that like Elgato now has a 4k
60 can't record that they've just
recently come out which i've been kind
of curious about so you could see it
happening and but it would probably need
to be pushed by one of the capture card
manufacturers to enable that
compatibility for that resolution yeah
thank you very much to even Zachary
Hummel 50 bucks
diam dude does G sink lower GPUs FPS
output as well as change my screens
refresh rate or is something wrong 1700
Beckstead 3.9 gigahertz for the sli gtx
ati with an ex 34 predator as the main
and 1440p freesync Mottershead up
vertically
getting under 100 FPS on the X 34
does it does G sink lower GPUs FPS
output it shouldn't no that's not how
it's supposed
no it has enough no influence on that as
well as change my screens refresh rate
or is something wrong okay did you
enable the 100 Hertz overclocking
feature within the OSD of your monitor
because there is you can enable J sync
with an Nvidia control panel via the OS
but you also have to enable 100 Hertz
with the OSD technically it is an
overclock with the X 34 so that could be
if the monitor is set to a max refresh
rate of say 80 Hertz or 90 Hertz then
that's what your do you think is gonna
cap at at beyond that if you're hitting
close to 100 if you're getting like 97
98 then that's just sort of a little bit
of fall-off that happens so that
wouldn't be unexpected it would only be
if you're getting significantly less
than 100 and also just double triple
check that s all I is enabled yeah you
might be like well I only use 60 fps
like you know you're frustrated still be
a hundred your first rate could still be
a hundred but your FPS might be lower or
you know unless you syncs enable or
something like that yeah give that a
shot
didn't go on my 40 again bingo I'm a
bode and Dan $5 I'd like to thank you
guys for inspiring my $1000 build I'm
extremely satisfied how it turned out
you guys are entertaining and fun keep
on truckin thank you sir Congrats on
your build we'll definitely well buffalo
warrior seven five dollars and fifty
five cents
I hope you guys hope you pimped my PC
tonight and joining a dogfish saison do
both do either of you have anything
invested in any cryptocurrency stocks
mutual funds nope I have a 401 K before
1k I don't know I don't know I don't
have any cryptocurrency stuff going on
no never really delved into that Dave is
for the eight Canadian fan
recommendations for push-pull on a
Celsius s 36 Venturi silent or dynamic
will I need a fan controller as well and
it defined as case depend mostly on your
motherboard whether or not any need a
controller and if you're able to connect
them all to that let's sit over them for
the venturi entries are high quality get
the static pressure ones yeah the ESPYs
and a fan controller I mean it's up to
you you could wire them straight to your
motherboard just typically will only go
for a fan controller if necessary if you
can wire everything up to your
motherboard especially if it's a decent
motherboard with good fan controls then
you're fine there yeah
jujubee's $10 but you to your last
comment yes Rison 1,200 asrock ad 315
Mini ITX the c7 cooler from car-wreck I
believe the G scale eight gigs single

this must be the four hundred dollar
bills yeah everything looks pretty well
balanced really nice yeah good job nice
rob crib fifteen are containers I sent
you the taxation is theft head ah-ha
finally you're a chimp for wearing it
all episode yet did it's probably only
time'll everywhere - I think it's still
like in the other room it's not over on
me that's just chillin on the board
no one's I think the MEP yet I'm just
waiting for someone to steal it I think
you robbed
Christopher wolf five dollars been
watching you all before new egg Paul
more builds please Kyle more videos with
your wife you saw I please my losses so
you can find her a coffee coffee I don't
know oh I have more builds like keep
doing builds we all have constantly do
builds yep cheese with you dollars
dollars damn boot Paul how would you
position the internet being essential in
the 21st century to the average American
to people who just don't get that any
resource uh cheese was I would compare
it to how information has been
disseminated to the populace
historically though the thing I like to
compare it to and I know this is a
little out there but like go back to the
way the clergy acted in like medieval
times great as their pitches which is
that the clergy had access to the Bible
and they were the only ones who knew how
to read and they
and a lot of situations actively didn't
want the rest of the population to be
able to read because that gave them the
power and the authority of being the
sole interpreters of the Bible
I started take it like that like I know
that might be a little bit of an extreme
example but like the way most people get
their information right now is from the
Internet's granted there's TV and that
kind of thing but that's becoming less
popular internet is becoming more
popular and we're coming to the
transition point where your TV is gonna
be provided over the Internet to the
Internet is just a data connection to
the internet that has all the data on it
so if you want to be able to access all
of that equally so you can look at
whatever sites you want to read up on
about whatever subjects then it needs to
have equal equal access security peer
was empty so everything was fine bottle
scary yeah but anyway that's I don't
know if that helps but do you have a did
you get some sign up for YouTube TV yet
I don't maybe I don't know okay
not sure I'm on the free trial right now
I have to pee really beds me too me too
thing uh Cody music Cody five dollars I
have a twenty six hundred K overclocked
to four point eight gigahertz about to
upgrade my GPU wanting a 1070 T I will I
have bottlenecking issues with the 2600
K and the 1070 ti
good job guys um yes there will be some
bottlenecking depending on the
applications or games that you're
playing but I don't think it's the point
where you'll be absolutely wasting your
money on a card like that I would
however I was sitter upgrading all your
slam you plan to 2600 K within the next
year so I would I would I would start
looking at options to to buying into
either a new rising platform or perhaps
coffee leg or whatever ninth generation
has around the corner and you can get
pretty good money for whatever
motherboard definitely for the CPU and
the motherboard I think a 2600 K and
whatever is easy sixty-eight z68 chipset
motherboard you have with that right now
FTP um could be pretty lucrative so sell
that shit put it on eBay and put that
towards a new
Rison system or a new Intel system I
think you'll be just fine
stop Scott Dilbeck $6 66 cents do you
think in AI 535 79 k is bottlenecking
history a lot of ball knocking questions
tonight
Astrix rx 588 gigabyte no I don't think
so also crossfire it with a 488 gigabyte
on certain titles that's skill well for
4k yes of course you could crossfire it
with a 480 if you wanted to in certain
titles that scale well for 4k that is an
option I always do recommend if you have
the option to to get a single fast GPU
over a multi-gpu setup that ensures that
you're going to get the performance that
that card can deliver
whereas multi-gpu scaling is a little
bit iffy depending on the title if you
are playing a game or plan to play a
game that you know for sure for certain
scales really well with say a crossfire
configuration then by all means go for
it but the other consideration that you
have to consider is a you know
additional heat more power that's being
do you need to now upgrade your power
supply because you're adding an
additional video card to the to the
equation do you need to upgrade your
fans now that you're generating more
heat or upgrade your CPU cord because
now it's being you know encumbered by
the heat that's being put off by these
two GPUs things like that SLI crossfire
they add certain complications that
often times in my opinion don't outweigh
the performance that you would otherwise
see from that type of scaling but every
situation is a little bit different so
good luck on that thank you very much
Scott
once again Channing Channing Williams
not Tatum it's not that popular be shown
yet $5 Paul equals professor honeydew
from the Muppets
professor honeydew from the Muppets I
will be the judge of this yeah I kind of
see it I kind of see he's got the round
he's got a very round head through a
round face that the glasses no soul
patch though so that is completely
completely false that's good call them
it was very very very close
Loic Loic Belanger Belanger sorry for
passing your name wrong tenkan a tears
is an 87 third k is automatically
overclockable to 5 gigahertz I don't
know you mean by automatically
overclockable mine go to 4.9 really easy
but it refuses to go higher without
stability issues it can be the fault of
cooling yeah it could be the fault of
cooling you might need a better cooler
to hit 5 gigahertz or you might have
just got a CPU that has not succeeded in
the silicon lottery as much as you hoped
it would and because of that maybe it
just doesn't hit 5 users reliably I'm so
clean lottery has a lot to do with just
the overall overclocked ability of CPUs
so it's not necessarily that you're
cooling sucks maybe you just don't have
the the silicon prowess on your
particular chip to hit that 5 gigahertz
but either way play around with it see
what happens
Colby young $5 GPU upgrade for Rison
1600 x4 1440 I would imagine that your
meaning 1440p GPU upgrade for 1600 X
I've done a video on this to pair like
what what GP would you pair with a 1600
X no no that was I think it was rising 3
never mind
um 600 X I mean you can go do gtx 1070 I
would say GTX 10 7010 7088 7010 72 70 is
best bang for the buck still and he was
1600 X you probably don't want to spend
a lot of money on a GPU 1070 then 70 I
agree with Paul Fred ranch $10 any
thoughts on the Alienware 34 curved
gaming g-sync monitor I have not even
seen anything about that
neither have I I would not I hope it's
not too expensive as we ready 4 inch
curved gaming g-sync monitors for the
past year 2
they're typically well above a thousand
dollars so if Alienware can somehow make
one that costs less than that then I'm
happy if not it's probably using the
exact same panel as the other
manufacturers like Acer and whatever and
it probably
the same thing yeah yeah um
Rob crib five Argentinians or Australian
sorry waiting for someone to steal it
quote-unquote waiting for someone to
steal it may be able to get text what is
he talking about their government
government yeah government stuff Johnson

hey and in that song go those that
conclude go in North Orange County who's
that Matthew begin Matt Johnson Matthey
from you Matt where is that
that's Canada what's NL in Canada no new
new look sharp
new new looks new Las Vegas new and L
know I may need provinces NL in Canada
new loot loot new Lumbergh Newfoundland
new Finland great that's no nuts nf not
NL Newfoundland no it's very--it's
differently that you said NL and now
Newfoundland the land that that's what
the L know : so new Finn is the first
part yes
Newfoundland a new newfound land I
thought it was they got there and like
hey this is new land we just found it
what should we call it like Newfoundland
it's brilliant I always thought it was
new Finland that's how it's pronounced
typically Newfoundland ok this should be
an F not an L potentially we'll leave
that up to Canada what do I need any
change that what are the steps thank you
man you to change that Thank You Beth
you got Kyle is gonna change how your
how your your place whatever the fuck
even know what it is what do you what
even where do you even live one lesson
for Patrick from Ontario also in Canada
thank you thank you to our Canadian
viewers you guys are awesome and
probably super friendly super friendly
super duper he got the thumb screw key
cap as well alright so that's all my
Johnson alright guys thank you so much
for tuning in to awesome hardware guys
it's always so fun chatting with you all
and we haven't rainiest hanging out do
we have ready trade this is gonna be for
goobers goobers five one five goobers
five one five G OOBE RS five one five
I'm hosting him from our channel as well
