channel today I am exploring a
frequently talked about topic within the
PC DIY community that has still managed
to amass two very opposing sides of an
argument and that is which way should
you mount your tower style err CPU
cooler in your system whether it be
horizontal with by that I mean a
horizontal airflow path with the fan
blowing air at the back ear case and
exhausting it out the rear or a vertical
airflow path with the fan exhausting it
out the top of your chassis the idea to
test this comes from user eggs are to be
crushed to left a comment on my recent
radiator placement video which you
should watch if you haven't already so
thank you very much eggs if you guys
happen to have a suggestion yourselves
on what I should test in the future
please send me an email to the address
right here eka made it just for you and
with the subject line test this in all
caps with a bunch of exclamation marks
just because they're fun don't leave a
comment if you have a suggestion just
because it's a little bit more difficult
for me to sift through that but moving
out of the topic at hand it is going to
vary the results that we're getting here
today is going to vary based on the
hardware we're using so allow me to
introduce the parts that we'll be using
for this rig starting with the core i7
7700 K from Intel which is their
flagship chip under their KD Lake family
this is going to be running at stock
speeds today but that's not really to
say it's going to be slow by any means
because it starts with a base clock of
4.2 gigahertz out of the box and turbos
24.5 pushing it any further would
probably overheat due to the cooler that
we're using which is the hyper 212 Evo
from Coolermaster it's a very popular
very reputable cooler but it's more on
the budget side and I didn't want to
push it too hard
I think 4.6 gigahertz on the CPU is
going to be plenty to put a load on it
and really test it and put it through
its paces but it is a more entry-level
economical cooler that still does have a
decent amount of thermal dissipation
performance to it it's a great bang for
the buck option it's incredibly popular
and well known within the community
which is why we're using it today we're
also going to be using the z2 70 gaming
Pro carbon from MSI as our motherboard
of choice along with 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx ddr4 3000 megahertz
Windows 10 and the rest of our
applications will be loaded up onto a
250 gig SanDisk Ultra 2 SSD and we've
also got a Newton 600 watt power supply
from fractal design as far as
graphics card goes I'm going to be
taking a similar approach to the
radiator video and testing two different
types of video card GPU shrouds
including the founder's edition gtx 1070
which is an enclosed blower style card
which will be injecting hot air out the
back of the case exclusively as well as
these otech and position gtx 1070 which
is a more standard adding board partner
card with an aftermarket cooler custom
PCB and it will be ejecting and
circulating hot air within the chassis
which could potentially warm up our
components so testing both of those with
each of our cpu cooler orientations will
give us a bigger clearer picture of
what's going on overall and finally we
have the defined s mid tower case from
fractal design this is the case that I
really like to go to for these types of
tests because it has plenty of mounting
options for fans and radiators at the
top and front and so forth the actual
chassis fans we're going to be using is
pretty extensive here we've got three
120 millimeter fans as a intakes at the
front of the chassis those are going to
be NZXT paste fans that i've pulled off
of the s340 and the Manta I believe
we've also got a 140 at the back from
fractal fractal design this is one of
their venturi fans again a 140 and
finally we have a second 140 millimeter
exhaust fan at the top from be quiet
this is one of their peer wings to fans
we've got a smorgasbord of fans going on
here but I really wanted to stack the
case full of fan so that we are not
bottleneck by case airflow in any way
for this test that way we're we're good
to go we've got plenty of positive air
pressure going in the case and that way
we can just focus exactly on how the CPU
temperatures themselves are affected by
the CPU cooler orientation so on that
note let's go ahead and finish up the
test that I've already got running in
the background here we're going to be
doing a half hour run of Unigine heavens
4.0 for each of our four tests and those
four tests again are going to be each of
the orientations for the for the CPU
cooler and the two different types of
GPU shroud I'm going to run those we're
going to circle back again as always and
compare and contrast the results and
draw some closing words and conclusions
sound good sounds good I'm excited I
think I think my wife just brought home
cinnamon rolls so I will be right back
mmm oh my god mmm
alright guys I have the results here and
it's going it's driving me insane right
now I don't know what to make of it all
some of the numbers make sense and
others are just way opposite of what I
was into
paiting so maybe you guys can help me
out here the first test I ran was the
horizontal path of airflow with the CPU
cooler blowing hot air towards the back
of the case and ejecting it out that way
and a enclosed blower style cart the
founders edition gtx 1070 and we found
62 degrees celsius on the cpu package
with that configuration but when we
switched the enclosed blower style card
with the open air shroud we actually
dropped four degrees Celsius on the CPU
which is weird I would have expected the
opposite where we're starting to
circulate more hot air in the chassis
it's going to warm up the CPU because
that's where the heat sink fan isn't
taking all of its air from so I don't
know how to really explain that guys I
mean I guess maybe this video needs a
part two or something or or something
went awry or maybe the answer staring me
straight in the face and I just can't
see it
so let me know in the comments if you
have an idea or theory on why that might
be the case the other pair of tests that
we ran featured the CPU cooler mounted
in a horizontal path position where the
airflow is traveling upwards and outside
the top of the case with the CPU
heatsink fan actually parallel with the
graphics card PCB and actually
underneath the heatsink as opposed to on
top of it pushing air upwards through
the thin array and what we saw with the
closed blower style card was 57 degrees
Celsius on the CPU and we went up five
degrees Celsius when swapping to an
open-air shroud graphics card like the
zotac amp Edition so that this makes
sense it makes sense that if you have
more hot air circulating in the case
walking off of your GPU that your CPU
temps would be affected negatively so
I'm perfectly fine with that that makes
sense you know my brains like yes okay
but the first to test the results there
does not compute did I do something
wrong
is there a theory that I'm not seeing
that maybe you guys can but if these
results are accurate and there is no you
know margin of error or user error then
at the end of the day we're still only
seeing a 5 degree Celsius variance
between our coolest and our hottest
results on the CPU 57 being below and 62
being the high definitely not nearly as
alarming or as concerning as the
temperature variance we were seeing with
the radiator placement test from last
week and to be honest guys I really wish
that I could have given you a definitive
winner for today's testing
has been like clearly this configuration
in this setup is superior in every way
shape or form under these circumstances
and you know case clothes and all that
jazz but I simply can't and I'm not
going to skew the data here just to get
a favorable ending that's more dramatic
or whatever so that's the best I got for
you for now again love to hear your
thoughts on this in the comments below
but that's all I got guys so be sure to
like this video if you enjoyed it
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff more tests like this will be
coming soon in the near future so stay
tuned for that have a good one guys
I love you all be safe be kind to each
other and until next time I'll see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
