channel hope you're all doing well today
I am building a mid-range workstation PC
that's right I said workstation this is
not a gaming rig so we're switching
things up a little bit but it is for a
purpose this is actually going to be a
system for my beloved father-in-law and
cousin who happen to work together at
their family-owned machine shop where
they do a lot of 3d modeling rendering
AutoCAD and all that sort of stuff and
their current system right now is is
just a hot piece of garbage quite
frankly I think they're still using
integrated graphics it's a prebuilt it
must be five plus years old if that's
any indication that it's time for an
upgrade so hopefully this new system
will speed up their overall workflow and
productivity so getting right into
single talked about the CPU choice first
I went with an AMD rising 5 1600 and I
went with rising over Intel because we
talked about Intel I mean what it will
do you got some mainstream options which
is like Katie Lake for example but you
only get four cores and up to eight
threads that's if you're spending over
$300 for 7700 or 7700 K but with Rison
AMD has has offered us a lot of
mid-range options with a quite
affordable that still rock a pretty high
corn thread count so here we have again
the 1600 has six cores and twelve
threads I should also mention there's a
software that my father-in-law and
cousin use at the machine shop is
Autodesk fusion 360 which I looked it up
does utilize multiple cores and thread
so it can take advantage of hyper
threading so I feel like this was a
great bang for the buck option is just
around 2 to 2 200 to 210 dollars the
1600 is just an amazing price to
performance chip that is again about
$100 cheaper than the mainstream desktop
CPU from Intel and the save a bit of
cash we're going to be using the r8
spire cooler that came included with our
CPU here because it's a fantastic little
stock cooler never thought I'd say that
but there you have it and as far as the
motherboard goes we're going be 350
because who needs x3 70 in a system like
this even though we are using a gaming
oriented motherboard from gigabyte this
is the a be 350 gaming free so it's got
you know like the fancy keep saying it's
got fancy heat sinks on the DRM and the
chipset but it's still only about 110
dollars
it's fairly budget oriented and it has
just a ton of connectivity more than
enough for what we need today it's also
one of these I think it is the only part
that I'm contributing to this bill just
because I had it longer
I don't really have much use for at this
point so you probably could find a
cheaper motherboard that would get the
job done for what they need it for but
since I already have this around might
as well give it a proper home for memory
we've got a 16 gigabyte kit of Corsair
Vengeance lvx this is 2 by 8 gig sticks
of course at 21 33 megahertz oh no wait
actually this is not right what are you
doing here I did not mean to put a 21 33
megahertz kit along with our Rison
system here so here we have some modules
that are 32 hundred megahertz users and
g.skill ripjaws five and still the same
16 gigabyte capacity to buy eight gig
sticks
we're going to be swapping that in
instead now for our graphics card I
opted for a workstation GPU just because
it's got a little bit more driver
implementation that's optimized for
workstation applications this is the
nvidia quadro 4000 not the P 4000 that's
that's much more expensive than this one
and it's a reverse switch which is why
it has no packaging the fans a little
bit dusty even cleaning that later now
it's true that gaming cards can
sometimes work adequately in the 3d
modeling software but just to be safe
and err on the side of caution I wanted
something that was guaranteed to work
smoothly with what they're using this
for and when you think about gaming
cards I mean they're really more
tailored for performance trying to
render as many frames as possible at the
expense of absolute precision when it
comes to calculating and doing all the
maths that's required for workstations
applications so that's why we're going
to go with the Quadro 400 if you guys
were curious it's about a $200 cards
refurbished at least I'm not sure what
the MSRP is on it new if you can even
find many of those because this is an
older architecture this is actually
based on Fermi from good ol Nvidia so
yeah there's that but at the end of the
day the different requirements for
fusion 360 aren't too heavy and I feel
like if they were able to scrape by even
with integrated graphics that this is
just going to make their system fly in
comparison at least for the next few
years definitely powering the system
we've got an EVGA 500 Watts just 500
Watts there's no real brand name because
the budget
cheapy power supply but it is 80 plus
certified and it's pretty much where the
features end it's not modular it doesn't
have fancy looking black cables or
anything like that but all we really
care about here is a unit that will
power our system safely without blowing
up a few weeks down the line for storage
we've got an SSD plus this is a sand
240 gig SSD just a regular old SATA
drive we've got the 3.5 inch form factor
I'm sorry 2.5 inch form factor of course
and nothing fancy it's a fairly budget
drive however it's going to be loads
faster than any mechanical drive sitting
next to it speaking of which we've got a
500 gig if you get Barracuda this is a
cute little Q and a half inch form
factor
I don't know III wasn't really expecting
it to be the size but that's how it came
and I accept
hard drives of all shapes and sizes I'm
not going to discriminate so that should
be a pretty nice bowl set up there by
the way this is going to be for the boot
drive I don't know if I mentioned that
and then finally our chassis that we're
going to be fitting all this in this is
actually what I'm most excited about is
to build inside of the Focus G from
fractal design this is one of their
brand new budget cases I think the MSRP
is only like 50 bucks or something but
it looks pretty nice for 50 dollars and
I really like kind of like the white
it's got a large side panel window which
you don't see too often on budget cases
at that price point and radiator support
as well at the front top and back I
believe tons of airflow at the front as
well you get two included 120 millimeter
fans they are white LED we'll be able to
see those powered on later of course and
there is probably a bunch of other
features in there that I don't talk
about right now but those are all the
parts guys you can find links to any of
this stuff in the description below and
on that note I'm going to go ahead and
clear the table and we can get to
building this thing one two three go t
go I was kind of sad when you do it by
yourself
Parappa prepare here she has guys all
built from the ground up the process was
very straightforward everything went
very smoothly inside of the Focus G here
some fractals beat and yeah it looks
pretty nice I mean yeah obviously colors
are a bit mismatched or whatever we
weren't going for aesthetics that being
said I think it's still like a
handsome-looking rig I do say so myself
and by the way a shout-out to wifey
sauce my wife for helping me build this
system you guys probably caught some of
her in the time lapse so she did a great
job everything looks really nice and
tidy
I helped of course some of the cable
management at the end but yeah looking
good as far as just you know sort of
feedback on building inside of this
chassis I mean for 50 bucks it was a
pretty smooth ride overall I feel like
all the all the cutouts the cable
cutouts are are sensible they're wide
enough for pretty much routing
everything you need and you've got some
at the top there for your obligatory
eight pin EPS for the CPU 24 pin a lot
of good routing options there the back
is well there's actually quite a bit of
space there's not a ton that you would
find like on a higher-end case but there
is enough to route pretty much all of
our cables again we were using a non
modular power supply you're still able
to route even our unused cables back
there I was at one point I was just
assuming that I would have to group all
the the reject cables that we weren't
using right here but I was actually able
to browse them behind and tuck them away
it was a five and a quarter inch because
so uses those anymore there's even a few
tie-down points behind there to keep
things all nice and tidy airflow is is
coming in pretty strong fans are quiet
by the way it's kind of the what it
looks like those white LED fans but the
front is completely meshed so you're
getting tons of airflow from the front
there go into the graphics card by the
way also it's a pretty spacious it's
pretty cavernous inside for being a
relatively slim chassis so you know
that's nice you get full graphics card
support for whatever length
I think 165 millimeters for high
clearance on the CPU cooler so pretty
much any tower that you want to fit in
here for the most part and power supply
clearance is obviously pretty stellar as
well so overall dig in this case there
are a couple critiques though I guess
going back to the cable
management the little cut out underneath
the motherboard for you know presumably
your HD audio is a little small unless
you remove the power supply so we
actually had to uninstall the power
supply to get that HD audio connector
through but that's a minor gripe the
power supply dust filter at the bottom
is hot garbage
IMO because just one of those super
flimsy ones are kind of a pain in the
ass but fortunately you don't need to
replace those or you know service that
too often but yeah I would have liked to
see maybe a rear fan again this is a
fifty dollar case so I can't really
complain too much but you know if you
wanted to just sort of aid in the
airflow path here you might want to
install a 120 it's a back but overall
ladies and gentlemen this is a pretty
sweet-looking
mid-range to budget workstation the
system so hopefully it serves my
father-in-law and cousin well speeds up
their workflow and all that jazz but
that is pretty much gonna do it for now
guys so thank you so much for tuning in
and let me know what you think of this
workstation if you've built a
workstation put you know primarily for
you there editing or 3d modeling or
whatever feel free to share your
