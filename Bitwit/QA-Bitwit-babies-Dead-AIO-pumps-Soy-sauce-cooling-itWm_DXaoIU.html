it's gonna be a little bit different
than we've done it before I actually
tweeted the other day and asked you guys
to ask me questions and I got like a
hundred and eighty something replies so
instead of sifting through all those to
pick the four or five questions that
make the most sense I'm just gonna run
down as many as I can that way I can
answer more of your questions and I
haven't pre-screened any of these so it
could get interesting here this video is
sponsored by Squarespace I've been using
Squarespace to host the channels
official site and merchandise store for
about two years now and compared to
building a site from scratch the
difference has been PC and console the
clean UI makes it easy to create and
customize content embed YouTube videos
social media posts and add new items to
our store a simplified all-in-one
platform means you never have to install
patch or upgrade anything and I can tell
you firsthand there 24/7 customer
support is better than most tech
companies in the PC space they'll tell
them I said that Squarespace has
everything you need for your next domain
website or online store head to
squarespace.com for a free trial and
when you're ready to launch and go to
squarespace.com slash bit wit to save
10% off your first purchase of a website
or domain well let's just start off with
steel Sherrod do you and wifey sauce
plan to have any big wood babies yes
Sharon actually we do it's it's not
happening anytime soon
but eventually that I think that's on
the bucket list for both of us so pretty
soon you'll probably see a new mascot
pop up for the channel and we haven't
really decided on a name yet obviously I
was thinking we could take it to a
Twitter poll but wifey sauce seems
pretty opposed to that idea for some
strange reason snickers asks when will
paul finish his HTPC build yes he's been
lagging on this for a while but I'm
gonna give Paul the benefit of the doubt
at the rate things are going I would say
2035 Tanner asks our first generation
rise and chips still worth it in 2018
heading into 2019 I I say yes I mean
especially we can find a really good
deal on one the price to performance
there is still very solid of course
second gen risin is gonna have better
technology built-in for automatically
overclocking itself but if you're gonna
manually overclock anyway it doesn't
really matter and you can save quite a
bit of coin especially with all the
holiday deals Black Friday deals coming
up right around the corner JD tech dear
Kyle when was the distinct moment that a
career on YouTube could become a
reality for you asking for a friend
honestly I think it was maybe around the
10,000 subscriber mark when I had a very
small but loyal fan base you know some
repeat customers were like oh I
recognize that guy in the comments
people actually are coming back to my
videos and I kind of had that as
momentum to drive me forward and I
thought you know if if I can do this I
can do 20,000 if I can do 20,000 I can
do 30,000 and then a hundred thousand
and so forth and I think the sooner you
realize that making a career on YouTube
can be a reality the easier it is to
sort of motivate yourself because you
now see that goal as an attainable
reality as a possibility as opposed to
some abstract moonshot that you may
never get to Rob Coleman Rob Coleman I
don't know who you are but I just want
to say that when and where did you and
wifey sauce first meet it was my senior
year in college I was a week away from
graduating and some girl from my class
who had the hots for me but the feelings
were mutual invited me to a house party
some bitchin house party it's still okay
to say bitch and people still say that
now I had nothing better to do on a
Friday night so I show up to the party
this girl immediately introduces me to
wifey sauce who's the host of the party
it was wife he sauces party she was
quite the rager back then I'll have you
know and I was like hey I like you you
look like someone I would like after
that introduction we kind of just went
our separate ways and didn't talk for
the rest of the party until the very end
when I mustered up enough liquid courage
to finally strike up a conversation with
her we kind of hit it off and we added
each other on Facebook right afterwards
that's how you know we were really into
each other and then the next day or two
I think I asked her out on a date and
the rest is history
fun fact wifey sauce and that girl are
no longer friends G Jones would you
rather fight one hundred duck-sized
Paul's or one Paul sighs duck damn and a
pulse
Paul's a relatively big dude he's bigger
than me it's cuz I'm small mostly so I
don't know one Paul sighs duck sounds
just like fighting Paul I don't know if
Paul can be a duck sometimes I don't
know what that means but I'm sure it's
true sometimes one hundred duck-sized
Paul's however not only sounds less
intimidating but also much more adorable
so I'm going to go that route mister man
is a boy what is your quest
I seek the ground scrub killer looks
versus performance performance first
always always always performance first
looks after Toledo's wood soy sauce cool
a PC or no very back tile stress hime
who would win in a fight between a
grilled cheese and a taco that is a
trick question because the grilled
cheese is already grilled so victory
point taco rare one asks are the GPU
prices low enough for me to build a PC
yet or should I wait longer if so how
long GPU prices as far as this year of
2018 is concerned have never been lower
it's a great time to buy a GPU
comparatively to the last few months
however we've got our TX coming out so
who knows if the 10 series cards are
gonna drop in price at all and as I
mentioned earlier we've got Black Friday
and holiday deals right around the
corner so if you can hold out till then
I would definitely say it's worth
checking out what those retailers have
to offer aj Sarah chena
if you have two SSDs one faster than the
other which should you install windows
on windows files take up a lot of space
so is it better to save the faster
storage for applications that might need
it more now this kind of depends on the
needs of the user and the limitations of
the system but as a rule of thumb I
typically use the fastest drive for my
operating system because apart from the
OS I'll usually install my frequently
used applications like my web browser my
suite of Adobe software and so forth and
I want that to feel a zippy and snappy
as possible so let's say I'm using a
blazing fast nvme SSD for my boot drive
I'll then use my slower storage may be
in the form of a mechanical hard drive
or SATA based SSD for all of my backup
and media files my games other files
that I don't necessarily use on a
regular basis and bear in mind those
drives tend to be a lot cheaper than the
faster alternatives so you can
definitely scale up in the capacities
that you might need for your secondary
and tertiary drives 2 - 4 - how would
someone go about moving Windows 10 off a
hard drive onto an SSD and keep the hard
drive as a game drive do you just clone
the drive because there's more data on
the hard drive then there is space on
the SSD making it difficult to simply
clone the drive please help
if at all possible I would just do a
clean install of Windows onto your SSD
that's gonna be the easiest option with
the least amount of fuss if you
can't do that for some reason then I
would probably get an external drive and
transfer all of the non-windows files
from your hard drive over to that
external drive clone your hard drive and
then reload the image onto your SSD you
should be good to go at that point good
luck and Godspeed Steve and Maria asks
what's your favorite color and
manufacturer of key switches
well back in 2012 my first mechanical
keyboard was a coolermaster CM storm
trigger featuring Cherry MX brown
switches and I've loved those switches
to death ever since I really liked the
tactile bump without the clicky
obnoxiousness of Cherry MX blues and the
amount of resistance is just perfect for
my taste so I'm gonna say Cherry MX
brown Taylor Martin tweets in my H 100 V
2 from Corsair stopped working yet in
the BIOS and in cue it says it's there
any suggestions on what it could be
now when you say it stopped working I'm
guessing you mean that it's no longer
doing an effective job of cooling your
CPU if that's the case it's very
possible that your pump on that unit has
died and fluid is no longer being sent
to the loop which is resulting in CPU
overheating now obviously this is a
serious hardware failure but I'm
guessing your aao is still plugged into
your motherboard somehow maybe via USB 2
or something like that and so it's still
being recognized technically by the BIOS
and the cue software at any rate you
should stop using your system in its
current state until you get the cooler
replaced or swapped out for a good
alternative well hot damn I feel like we
only answered a fraction of the
questions here but my throat's getting a
little sore honestly and you guys are
probably sick of me anyway at this point
so I'm gonna cut things off here guys
thank you to everyone who tweeted in
those questions you can follow me at bit
wit Kyle on the Twitter's or the
instagrams if you want to get more
involved in videos like this thank you

it and get subscribed to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
