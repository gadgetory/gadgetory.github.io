too noisy I can't sleep do I at least
get a bedtime story
fine once upon a time there was a tiny
little boy who couldn't fall asleep loud
noises scared him and made him what the
bed
everyone goes with their own pace tock
anyway one day the little boy found a
magical cake called the define ski by
crackle design impressed by the
minimalistic Scandinavian design he
hopped decide to investigate the
interior the case was rooming without
being too big offering plenty of room
for him to frolic and play her little
boy was amazed full length Keith's new
Shrek an ample cooling airport and then
he saw whole walls for all the liquid
corners
the best part with a large side panel
window so he didn't have to be afraid of
the dark a little boy built happily ever
after the case your dreams is finally
here click the link of the description
to learn more about the defined see from
fractal design what's going on guys
welcome back to the channel hope you're
all doing well today
I am first off shooting from the brand
new studio which is obviously not
complete yet so sorry it's kind of a
bland background for now but it's a work
in progress and things are coming along
really nicely so I can't wait to show
you guys the studio tour when it's all
finished but we are we are here for four
other things we are actually doing a
thread Ripper unboxing world's first
mind you even though it's probably going
up at the same time as a bunch of other
tech tubers and stuff I received two
packages from AMD last week and I don't
know why to but I'm not exactly sure
which one to open first
wifey sauce which via the nice case here
or the ominous cardboard box cardboard
box like a suspect especial it even has
that logo on the side it that is true
this does have a one of a kind bit wet
logo it's a really nice really nice kind
of Pelican case that's customized for
the channel so very excited to actually
receive this is a beautiful case so
we'll put this aside for now save it for
last alright so let's go with this guy
first you can see I just couldn't
contain my excitement when I first got
the package so I did cut the Box open
and just lifted these flaps to peer
inside but I didn't really see much
other than this arrow here thermaltake
flow ring 360 premium edition RGB so
it's a 360 red I'm assuming a IO with an
included tr4 bracket one would assume
some bubble wrap looks like it's been
packaged very securely and safely so
here it says Rison for a dripper the
components you need to create the
ultimate desktop system platform
unlocked unrestrained uncompromising so
this I think these boxes are users empty
these are for packaging just for spacing
and stuff I better not throw a box that
has the processor in it
right here we go I'm talking about so
inside the box first thing we heat we
see here some G scale Ram looks like RGB
3200 speed 16 gig kit so 2 by 8 gig
sticks there's actually two of them here
so in total it gives us about 32 gigs to
work with very nice I could use these
for a bunch of different things
ROG zenith extreme this motherboard is
absolutely insane I got a chance to
check it out at Computex is the x3 99
platform of course on the new chipset
tr4 socket oh my god why is it so heavy
this is a heavy it's because of the
friggin socket the socket is like just
pure metal it's the biggest socket I've
ever seen look at this guy holy moly
look at that socket DIMM got two slots
you can pop a couple empty SSDs on there
right next to the RAM and we've got a
really nice sort of heatsink over the
the chipset my goodness is going to be
fun to build with can't wait to to use
it for maybe a test bed coming soon the
thermaltake flow ring 360 let me know if
you guys want to see any sort of
coverage on this I mean it's a pretty
standard area I think the main appeal
here is that it's got RGB for one
probably uses the ring fans from
Thermaltake but it's also tr4 compatible
so that's pretty cool it'll be
interesting to see how well this cools
the 1950 X assuming of course AMD has
sent us one let's see what else is in
here
ooh Wow MOG goodness yeah okay so you
know
holy smokes it appears thermal take an
AMD are totes in bed together for this
launch because they've also included a
tough power grant 1200 watt power supply
80 plus gold good lord
okay so these are just empty boxes
nothing else in here is verification
let's go to the good one let's get let's
get open to go up in the Pelican case
here we go
by the way ninety percent of the tenants
in this office building are lawyers so
they're probably wondering what the hell
I'm doing here and what it is exactly
that I do because I'm probably making
the most noise on this floor right now
no doubt all right oh my that that is
beautiful wifey you're going to want to
get a close-up of this alright here's
the money shot
oh my goodness
what will will hold on hold on what even
is this look at this just look look at
it it has my it has the channel name
engraved into the CPU this is absolute
madness this has to be in 1950 X is this
functional this isn't just for fun right
I can actually install this and run this
is great I was not expecting this it's a
fully custom itched 1950 X what I would
assume is a 16 core part and look it on
the bottom right that says 32 out of 250
meaning there's a very limited quantity
and I think I think it just sort of
opens like this perhaps wait doesn't
open at all oh oh oh yeah come on come
over here look at this look at this oh
my god 32 out of 250 the etching job is
just I mean it's pretty much standard
but it has my name on it so it's way
better put this back on really quick so
you guys can see the backside what's
kind of cool through the glass actually
boom oh my good guys
I am very curious if this is a 1950 X
because if you look over here we've got
two CPUs
allegedly right to two retail packages
this says the 1950 XO this is the 16
core 32 thread parts this is the 1920 X
12 cores 24 threads
did they give us three processors no
doubt that the one that they custom edge
to the 1950 X and if it's functional
I'll be damned if they've also thrown in
the second one in the retail box but
let's just do a quick unboxing of the
1920 oh my God look there's light
there's like lighting
wait it's supposed to light up I don't
understand why they're light here oh I
didn't even notice that it's kind of
lighting in here yes because it's really
bright that's true alright so I don't
even know like they didn't tell us a
tech day how to actually open these oh
rip here okay so the 1920 X 3.5
gigahertz base with 4.0 gigahertz
precision boost as I mentioned in the
previous video I did
there will be an X afar boost of 200
megahertz bringing us to 4.2 gigahertz
of course if cooling conditions allow
let's go ahead and open it like so
unlock the power we certainly will
okay and it looks like it just boom
comes out like that this is just
absolutely this is how every product I
don't care if I'm buying like $2 skull
candy earbuds they should come packaged
like this now it's a terrible idea I
think there's a metal bracket here it
looks like it should come off like so
yeah this isn't unboxing honey you were
done one of these scanning of that and
then we take the plastic thing off you
have to squeeze it I'm smart to try to
get it out oh all right
oh my goodness so here it is guys 1920 X
in the flesh and I think I believe we
keep the orange bracket here on so we
need that for installation which I'm not
going to install it right now but you
know what we should install it right now
let's all right honestly guys I'm
completely winging this I have no idea
what I'm doing so it looks like we need
a torque screw and if I remember
correctly at AMD tech day they mentioned
ahahah included with every Rison thread
River processor is a torque screw for
for installing the CPU of course and an
ASA tech bracket so if you actually have
an ASA tech CLC usually one of the
circular ones that look pretty OEM then
you should be able to fit that on to
socket tr4 here with the use of this
adapter so we're just going to install
the CPU though let's go ahead and use
this torque screw we've got three
different screws here with the torque
fitting okay look at that just sort of
pops up I guess oh you want to remove
that plastic piece I remove the Kluber
as well alright so I'm pretty sure it
goes this way
first off and I think you want to sort
of slide it into this tray now look at
cassette tape you know what those are
it's got little rails that you got to
slide it across otherwise it won't fit
properly that looks good then you just
want to lower it down lakhs so alright
so this bracket goes down so then
there's actually a way to do
you have to close it in the right border
we have to screw the Torx screws with
the top middle one first from the bottom
right one and then the bottom left
finally so let's bolt that down so here
she is folks my first ever installation
of AMD Rison thread ripper on the x3
ninety nine platform pretty sweet I
think this is going to be a fantastic
platform I'm really excited to start
using it and testing with it for all of
you guys and myself included I'm really
just super stoked now before we close
the video out going back to my initial
question is there a CPU inside of the
nineteen fifty xbox as well actually you
can kind of you can see the CPU right
through the thing you'll see the CPU
right through the front of the box so it
appears that AMD has given me two
nineteen fifty X's assuming of course
that this thing right here is in
nineteen fifty X which I would imagine
it can't be anything else I don't know
if I can if I can run this but this is
it this is probably meant to stay on my
desk right but why would I just keep it
on my desk not in a motherboard running
awesome frickin games and editing things
why don't I have to am I going to be
that guy who only has one 1950 X in use
that is that is not who I am okay and
that is pretty much gonna do it for this
unboxing sorry it was quick and dirty
super dirty
just the way you guys like it because
again things are really frantic right
now at the new studio but this is really
exciting stuff guys let me know what you
think about the red lip or so far if
you're excited about it yourself and
what kind of testing you'd like to see
me do on it more importantly always open
to new ideas from you guys so thank you
so much for watching also be sure to
toss a like on the video if you enjoyed
it and subscribe for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon including this
amazing studio tour that's right around
the corner so thank you guys so much
have a good one purse</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
