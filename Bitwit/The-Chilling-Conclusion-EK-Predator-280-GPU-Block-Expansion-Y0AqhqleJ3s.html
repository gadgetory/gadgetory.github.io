stylings three here I think you're gonna
love them nice can't wait to check these
out thanks by the way my car broke down
and I was wondering if you what the whoa
whoa hey hey stop it stop don't don't
know what's happy hey be quiet in here
Oh Kyle wasn't prepared to be blown away
by the new silent wings three fans from
be quiet are you for a cooler quieter
system click on the link in the
description for more info what's up gasp
so for the sake of argument let's assume
that lately you've been tossing around
the idea of trying your hand at custom
water quality it seems a part of you
can't shake the burning desire to
experience those chilly temps higher
over clocks and glorious acoustics that
come with a robust liquid-cooled setup
you've been fantasizing about your dream
loop for so long now there's hardly any
room left for Emma Watson's feet at the
same time you'd be treading in uncharted
waters and you're still unsure if the
challenges and time invested are worth
the payoff not to mention the upfront
cost would bleed your bank account dry
and you'll need some disposable income
left over in case an tech ever starts
making good products again truth be told
you've been sitting on the fence for so
long it's starting to look kind of
infected but there may still be hope for
you yet because the products were
testing out today offer a middle ground
solution that rival the performance you
might expect from a custom loop without
the hassle or extreme cost from the
folks over at ek comes their critically
acclaimed predator ayo now offered with
280 millimeter ads and a prefilled GPU
water block to easily expand that loop
with quick disconnect technology in
theory this should provide a seamless
water-cooled solution to help you
optimize your system to its fullest so
today we'll be outfitting our air-cooled
gaming PC here with all the predator
fixes and measuring any improvements we
might see in temps acoustics and
overclocking personally I'm just glad
there's no chance of this happening
again
on that note the test system will be
using resides in the infamously inverted
Corsair 600 C which was actually one of
the few chass√©s I had on hand that
could fit the predator 280 comfortably
instead of being built into the water
block the pump in wiring is positioned
next to the radiator making it the
biggest 280 AIO on the market if your
case claims to support 280 millimeter
radiators you might want to triple check
the forums to make sure it can fit this
one being chilled by cooler master hyper
212 evo we have a core i5 6600 K for our
CPU on an ACC 170 deluxe with 16 gigs of
g.skill Trident Z at 3200 our video card
is the gaming x GT X 1080 from MSI which
I recently did a review on powered by an
EVGA 650 watt GQ and a one terabyte
crucial MX 200 SSD for our OS and
applications a trio of Corsair AF 140
quiet Edition fans were also used for
dual intakes and a rear exhaust on this
air-cooled system I was able to take the
6600 K to a stable 4.7 gigahertz at 1.3
5 volts which had a max temp of 78
degrees Celsius after 30 minutes of
concurrent stress testing with a 264 and
Unigine Heaven 4.0 it's a bit toastier
than most gamers would like to see but
honestly not half bad for the $30 hyper
212 of course chances are you won't be
stress testing your CPU in the
background while gaming so with just
heaven 4.0 running the CPU maxed out at
a much cooler 66 degrees Celsius maxing
out the power and temp targets our
factory overclocked GTX 1060 was pushed
even further with a poor clock offset of
155 megahertz that took the max core
clock frequency to 2.1 gigahertz though
the chip quickly backed down to a
constant 2,050 our memory clock received
an offset of 370 megahertz taking it to
a clock speed hovering in the 1340s the
GPU hits 78 degrees Celsius leaving much
room for improvement for our predator
setup as for acoustics here's what the
system sounds like after running Heaven
4.0 for about 15 minutes
as you might have heard the noise is
audible but stays fairly quiet under
load and shouldn't prove distracting to
even those with sensitive hearing
especially if you're listening to ingame
sound after conducting our air-cooled
tests I went ahead and installed the
predator Hardware which was actually
quite easy I guess that's kind of the
point after all mounting the GPU block
is just like installing any of EK
standard blocks which involves a bunch
of screwing throwing down some thermal
pads and thermal grease and more
screwing I do think the screws could be
a bit higher quality especially since
the four screw surrounding the GPU need
to be tightened as much as possible and
it felt like I was close to stripping
them once or twice but overall this was
a straightforward procedure the CPU AIO
installs much like any other competitor
though the fans come pre mounted to the
radiator and I had to flip them around
in order to set them to intake air at
the front of our chassis once
everything's installed
attaching the quick disconnects
literally takes five seconds and is the
easiest thing ever all without leaking a
single drop of fluid be warned however
that you're likely to end up with a lot
of excess tubing
unless building inside of a massive case
so you may have to restrain the tubes
with zip ties or velcro straps to keep
them from interfering with objects like
your side panel or chassis fans also
what's up with that GPU sag it seems
removing the air cooler leaves your PCB
a bit flimsier than it was
hopefully ek can solve this by including
some sort of support bracket or
backplate in the future because the MSI
backplate I carried over from our GT X
1080 didn't seem to correct the droop
egde at all so for an apples-to-apples
comparison I initially ran the a 264 in
Unigine stress test on our now liquid
cooled PC with all the same overclock
settings and look at this the better
thermal conditions actually pushed our
GPU boost clock to 2.1 gigahertz
a 63 megahertz improvement over air
without touching a single setting GPU
temps fell all the way down to 59
degrees max and averaged out at around
56 degrees Celsius with an ambient temp
of 81 degrees Fahrenheit pretty neat
during this stress test our CPU saw less
impressive temps reaching 71 degrees
Celsius and only going as low as 67
degrees Celsius while gaming the
temperatures here could stand to be a
bit cooler so perhaps more time should
be spent adjusting the fan curve to
create the thermal and acoustic profiles
were comfortable with before we dive
into the acoustics demo I should mention
the ek Bartter fans were connected to
the motherboard CPU fan header
which was controlled via custom fan
curve I set up in the BIOS this was the
same fan curve and testing methodology
used for those Corsair AF 140s we heard
earlier
what was already a pretty quiet
experience with the air-cooled system is
made even quieter with the introduction
of the aao it also means we could
probably set a more aggressive fan curve
to further improve thermals without
being a nuisance to our ears so at this
point it's not a huge shock but
switching over to water cooling allowed
us to hit the same settings with lower
temps and makuu sticks but the final
question remains how much more were we
able to overclock the system within
these cooler operating parameters well I
failed to get the CPU to hit 4.8
gigahertz without exceeding unsafe
voltages but I was able to maintain our
4.7 gigahertz frequency with a lower v
core of just 1.32 volts although this is
just a point zero three volt difference
coming from air it's still a noteworthy
bump in power efficiency and may even
help to extend the lifespan of our CPU
on the GPU side of things we gain 20
megahertz on the core clock and 30
megahertz on the memory clock giving us
a constant core clock speed of 20 113
megahertz and a memory clock of 13
hundred and 50 megahertz overall
switching to liquid gave us a 63
megahertz increase on the core clock
which isn't spectacular but it is
something I guess the takeaway here is
don't expect your frame rates to
skyrocket from slapping on a couple of
these water blocks it seems the real
gains made today we're primarily in
temperatures and acoustics speaking of
which here's a final back to back sound
test with all three configurations we
looked at today
on a final note this liquid cooling duo
will set you back three or four hundred
dollars which I'd only consider
affordable if comparing it to the cost
of buying all the water cooling Hardware
separately so without prolonging the
inevitable question any longer is it
worth it
well if performance is the only thing
you're after I can't say the solution is
a worthwhile investment since we
couldn't get the CPU to go any faster
and we only saw a minor speed increase
with our GTX 1080
the upshot is that if you're suffering
from my video card is on fire syndrome
our GPU temps drop 22 degrees Celsius
coming from air which is absolutely
insane
CPU temps were a tad underwhelming in
our set up but then again the loop runs
so damn quietly there's definitely room
to push the fans harder while
maintaining a reasonable sound profile
the final appeal here is convenience and
time savings a lot of us want that
custom water-cooled experience but lack
the time or patience to take the plunge
so EK has really done a bang-up job here
to make the entire process super quick
and easy if you're looking for the kind
of results we saw here today and you've
got a few hundos to spend then maybe you
should buy this thing but that is gonna
do it for now guys so before you go
