channel hope you're all doing well so it
has been about a month now since the
launch of risin 7 and after all the
reviews and articles and videos have
gone up we can pretty much conclude that
when you're talking strictly about
gaming something like the core i7 7700 K
from Intel their flagship cable a chip
outperforms the Rison 7 stack most of
the time now there are of course certain
exceptions to this rule but for the most
part the 7700 K reigns supreme when
you're talking about purely gaming so
what we're here to do today is to see if
that pide sort of shifts or changes at
all if we throw a live encoding into the
mix so today we're going to be streaming
out three Triple A games and ultra
settings a couple different based
resolutions to see if perhaps when the
system is tasked with live encoding if
the 1700 for example that were going to
be testing today can eventually pass up
the 7700 K in terms of gaming
performance as the 7700 K might struggle
a bit more since it does have fewer
cores and threads at its disposal to
handle live streaming but we're going to
find out what kind of impact streaming
has on either of these platforms today
so that should be kind of interesting
here's a quick look at the rest of the
testing hardware you can see that we've
got some over clocks running on these
CPUs as well the 1700 was pushed to 3.9
gigahertz with the 7700 K hitting 4.9
would have loved to hit 5 gigahertz but
we didn't quite have the thermal
dissipation we needed with that hyper
212 X turbo as it is a smaller air
cooler tower you can also see we've got
a gtx 1070 founder's Edition running
stock for both systems so that is a
constant between our platforms today and
that is running the latest local driver
3 78.92 on Windows 10 64 bit as far as
our streaming settings are concerned I
fired up OBS studio and dialed in a
3,500 kill bit per second bit rate and
I'm also using the fast preset of the
x264 software encoder also the streaming
output resolution and frame rate that
we're going to be using for all of these
tests are 1920 by 1080 at 60 frames per
second as far as base resolutions though
the base resolutions of the the user is
natively gaming yet we're actually
testing two of those 1920 by 1080 and
2560 by 1440 I would imagine that these
are two very popular resolutions that a
lot of live streamers like to game at
which is why I'm testing both of them
today
here we have doom at the base resolution
of 1080p and the way these charts are
going to work is that the upper half is
going to represent gaming performance
whereas the lower half of the chart
represents gaming while streaming and
you can see the top half when we're just
talking about gameplay here the 7700 K
does pull ahead of the 1700 by a small
margin which is pretty expected and then
once we actually kick in the streaming
aspect of things
the 7,700 case still does pull ahead of
the 1700 and you could actually see that
there's a performance dip across both
CPUs I would I would even say that the
1700 takes a larger hit a slightly
larger hit than the 7700 K which is
pretty interesting doom isn't a super
CPU heavy game so the 7700 K still has
quite a few resources at its disposal
even though we are streaming out at
1080p moving up to a base resolution to
1440p when we're strictly gaming the
performance gap closes in a bit simply
because we're now a little bit more GPU
bound than we once we're at 1080p and
that's why we see the 1,700 almost
staying neck-and-neck with the 70 700 K
but not quite we can also see the
performance gaps start to close when
we're streaming however it just seems
that this game isn't quite demanding
enough on the CPU from the 1700 to
actually pull ahead of its Intel
counterpart now this graph here sort of
illustrates the impact of streaming on
performance with either CPU and both
based resolutions and that's reflected
as a percentage so obviously lower is
going to be better on this particular
chart and you can see the 7700 K just
does a bit better overall than the 1700
at both resolutions the 1700 really
struggled with 0.1% and 1% lows
especially at 1080p it didn't do so hot
there obviously it was still in
enjoyable and smooth experience overall
but based on the numbers here we can see
the 7700 K actually has an easier time
streaming Doom at either resolution
let's see if things change it all in GTA
5 at 1080p once again we see the 7700 K
pull ahead of the 1700 when we're just
gaming however when we start streaming
you can notice that the one percent in
point one percent lows are a lot more
evenly matching that between both chips
and in fact the point one percent lows
of the 1700 actually beat out the 7700 K
here and that could maybe partially be
explained by the fact that GTA 5 is a
heavily threaded and heavily a-c-p
CPU intensive game which could mean that
the
7,700 k is sort of struggling to juggle
both the game and live encoding on the
fly' now 1440p the frame rates are
nearly identical between both chips when
we're simply gaming and that's again
likely due to some elements of GPU
bottlenecking from cranking up that
resolution but when we switch over to
streaming notice how the 1% in point 1%
lows of the 1700's are now clearly
overtaking the 7700 K and by a sizable
margin actually and even though the
average frame rates of our rising chip
aren't quite up to snuff with the 7700 K
we're still seeing an overall smoother
experience in theory because we're
having some tighter frame times and
average frame rates the gap between
those three figures is much closer
together than they are on the 7700 K so
this is definitely a huge point for the
Zen architecture in this particular test
now the overall performance hit when
streaming in GTA v certainly looks a bit
different than it did in do with the
7700 K incurring nearly a 40%
performance penalty at both resolutions
with its 1% lows which is definitely
going to add a bit of perceptible
choppiness to the user experience even
its average FPS at 1080p
was sort of lagging behind the 1,700
taking a 29% performance hit as compared
to the 1700's 25 at 1440p there's really
no comparison here with the core i7
taking some massive hits to its 1% in
point one percent lowest point one
percent low is at 52 percent performance
degradation when streaming it simply
does not keep up or handle itself nearly
as well as the 1700's in GTA 5 the last
game we tested was battlefield 1 and at
1080p we see the 7700 K once again
beating out the 1700 when we're just
gaming it's business as usual kicking
the streaming though and we actually see
the average frame rate of the 1700 pull
ahead of the 7700 K for the first time
with 103 fps versus the 101 that the
core i7 was able to achieve and look at
those 1% and 0.1% lows just a staggering
difference to validate these numbers I
triple check my settings and ran these
tests again and again three or four
times just to make sure that they were
accurate and time and again we were
seeing these numbers pop up within one
to three percent variance so these are
accurate these are numbers this is how
the 7700 K performs under the pressure
of live encoding switching over to 1440p
we see the trend continued as the 1700
superior 1% and point 1% lows and the
7700 K is just displaying frames on
screen a bit longer and a bit more
frequently than the 1700s indicating
that it's slightly more choppy and less
fluid experience overall even though it
might be marginal it still is suffering
based on the data quite a bit more than
its risin rival when it comes to
streaming battlefield 1 if we take a
look at the performance hit percentages
here we can just see how much the 7700 K
starts to drop off when streaming this
game with its 1% lows I mean incurring a
49% performance penalty at 1080p and a
37% hit at 1440p just kind of
devastating blows here point 1% lows are
even worse granted those aren't going to
be nearly as noticeable in-game as 1%
lows are they're still quite devastating
and you compare that to the tighter
groupings the 1700 is able to achieve
with its average and 1% lows it's just a
phenomenal victory here for the 1700 and
perhaps the rising 7 family as a whole
so to kind of sum up all the data that
we have here whether or not the 1700
outperforms the 7700 K when
live-streaming heavily depends on the
game engine itself and how it interfaces
with the CPU architecture its cores and
threads and so forth but what we did see
on several occasions is that in certain
titles that were heavily CPU intensive
like GTA 5 or battlefield 1 the 1700 in
many instances actually pulls ahead of
the 7700 K when it comes to frame times
and also delivers an overall more fluid
perceptibly fluid experience for the
user just based on the tighter groupings
of those frame rates overall compared to
the 7700 K which further validates my
earlier claims that the Rison 7 stack is
a better value per dollar than KD lake
is when it comes to heavily
multi-threaded applications that go
beyond the scope of just gaming whether
you're talking about rendering and
coding live encoding streaming and
things like that
Rison 7 is really showing some great
promise in those areas and it's also
very exciting because it's still really
early on for good old Rison we're still
waiting for these n architecture to be
put into the hands of more game
developers so that they can further
optimize their game code and deliver
higher performance on the a m4 platform
when it comes to a lot of these triple-a
titles that's super exciting there's a
lot more to come more testing to be done
for sure
but that's that's what I got for you
guys for now so hopefully you enjoyed
this video be sure to toss me a like on
it if you did and feel free to leave
your thoughts about this these results
today in the comments below I'd love to
hear all about them but have a good one
guys I will see y'all in the next video
