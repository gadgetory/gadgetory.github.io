well this is a non scripted video
because it just did I think it requires
that personal touch since it's a very
personal moment for myself and the
channel of course this is where I unveil
the new channel name that I've been
talking about for oh the last four or
five weeks now about a month ago about a
little over a month I released a channel
update video basically announcing that I
was going to change the name of the
channel but it would no longer be
awesomesauce network but it was going to
change to something that I identified
with more in terms of current format and
style my videos the content and my
personality that I felt awesomesauce
Network just didn't quite represent me
as well as it could have as it used to
back in the day since then you guys have
been asking non-stop what's the new
channel name where you gonna talk about
the new channel name cow when he got
released new channel name Cal I've been
thinking constantly since I released
that video believe it or not of a good
channel name I was blinking so hard the
last month or so so I'm really excited
that I actually have something now that
I firmly firmly think is a good name and
that really represents the channel and
who I am and things like that so um
without further ado the channel name
that I'm going with from here on out
that is going to be replacing
awesomesauce Network as we know it is
Kyle's two tek-tips Canucks now I'm
totally joking that username was already
taken actually I just had to poke some
fun at some of the ridiculous names that
you guys were suggesting in the comments
but I always appreciate the feedback
regardless so to be serious now the
official name that I'm going with for
the channel is bit whipped and what
you're seeing here isn't the official
logo but it is how the the channel name
is going to be displayed from here on
out which is one word all over case I'm
just going to try to keep that
consistent when I do make a logo and any
time it's written out online on the
interwebs on social accounts and things
like that
so you guys are probably wondering first
off where I got the name from after it
took me so long why did I finally settle
on bit wit really it's self-explanatory
I think like bit is in reference to a
bit of data like a 1 or a 0 in binary
kind of like plays to the tech side all
the tech content that's on the channel
and then which is in reference to my
witty side I suppose because you know
I'd like to throw in some jokes or you
know throwing some punches in my videos
here and there and it's kind of one of
the things that sort of separates me
from some of the other reviewers so I
think it I really identify with this
name
and it's short and sweet kind of checks
all the boxes that I wanted in a new
channel name so I'm Mull it over all I
ask is that you guys give it a chance if
you hate it right now off the bat I
actually didn't like it I thought about
it maybe four weeks in and then I just
threw it in the back of my mind I didn't
even think I didn't write it down or
anything like now I don't like that name
and then a week later I thought about it
began I was like actually the kind of
works and I started asking people like
really close to me like what do you
think of this name and everyone seemed
to like it
everyone not one person didn't like it
after they thought about it and stuff
and so I think that was a you know a
good sign that I was on on the right
track and stuff but getting down to
business here the Twitter and Instagram
handles for the channel have now been
updated to reflect the new channel name
so on Twitter I'm no longer at forever
Kyle it's at underscore bit wit and
that's actually the same for Instagram
as well they're both underscore bit wit
because damn you two people who already
took bit without the underscore I just
wasn't original enough apparently
and I'm also working with fullscreen
right now on changing the URL for my
YouTube channel so it's not going to be
youtube.com slash c slash awesomesauce
network it's obviously going to be
replaced with something more befitting
to the new channel name Facebook and
twitch I'm still working on updating if
it's not already updated right now I'm
going to be updating those to the new
name as best as I can I know they have
different rules for what can be changed
and what can't and as far as my online
store goes where I'm selling shirts and
stuff that's still gonna be the same
right now but I'm gonna be changing it
soon if I haven't already done so by the
time this video posts awesome Hardware
as far as the livestream is concerned
that I do with Paul every Tuesday I
think that's gonna go unchanged awesome
hardware is kind of like its own beast
and I think regardless of what the
channel names
what channel names Paul and I have for
our individual companies I think awesome
Hardware just kind of sticks it fits the
the the personality and the energy of
the show so well I haven't honestly
talked to Paul about this yet but I have
a feeling we're not going to change the
name of that stream and on a final note
I want to keep this short and sweet guys
and not take up too much more your time
but I did mention this in the last
channel update that even though the
channel is changing the content here is
not it's still gonna be tech it's still
going to be you know reviews and
benchmarks and all that sort of thing
the one
I'll say content-wise that might change
is that I really am going to try to push
to do more tech related sketch comedy
videos in the future so things that are
in the same vein as the embargo wrap for
the GTX 1060 or even older content that
I've done like a nature tech or what
it's like to be a PC enthusiast fun
videos like that because I think
apparently you guys really enjoy
watching them and I really do enjoy
making them a lot so I would like to do
you know sprinkle in a few more of those
maybe one or two a month if possible so
that's pretty much it everything else
going on changed and it should not be a
huge deal I'm just changing the channel
name like I said but that is pretty much
it I think um yeah so but there's not
much else to it guys let me know what
you think of the channel name whether
you love it or you hate it I'm really
curious to hear your thoughts in the
comments so leave me leave me some
feedback down below and that here's all
thank you all so much for your support
that you've given me in the channel up
till this point I really can't I don't
know I can't thank you enough honestly
and yeah I'll just keep doing what I'm
doing I guess I'll just don't keep doing
this and you keep being you YouTube
alright this is getting weird I'm
getting out here bye guys have a good
one subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already I got to move and I will
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
