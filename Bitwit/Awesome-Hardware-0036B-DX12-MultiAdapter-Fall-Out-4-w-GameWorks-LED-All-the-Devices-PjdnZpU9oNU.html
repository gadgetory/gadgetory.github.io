ramping up a lot of time for one last
chip we are live I'm not eating anything
what's up guys some professional welcome
back part 2 of Awesome hardware episode
36 if you didn't catch part and you're
watching this on youtube go ahead and
check out paul's channel Paul's hardware
watch part a and then come back here or
watch Part B first and then watch part a
if you're feeling ballsy and you're just
living life on the edge either way it
doesn't matter if it's a B let's be be
from blood not sadi that's a B it's a
deep I usually just do both at the same
time yeah just pick the one that works
that's blood how do you know how to do
that setup uh I'm gonna be scary oh oh
oh what do we do now Cal's gonna
introduce the show while I go get
another beer okay I'll introduce the
show okay really oh I want to be
here ok go ok just me and you now guys
my shirt will be off on Paul returns no
I'm sorry I can't do that but a couple
things to point out in case you missed
the first half of the show we do have
some merchandise that we are selling of
course as always we've got shirts in the
awesomesauce merch store as well as
Paul's hardware net / store or no it's
stored up Paul's hardware done net or
something like that man this is falling
apart rapidly let's see let's go ahead
and go to the main camera here or the
lower third no that's not right I don't
know how to work this thing Paul's
bottles in the way of OBS and I can't
see right now so let's go ahead two
stories aha now you can see my store
haha Kyle learns OBS in this episode of
Awesome hardware go ahead and purchase a
shirt or hoodie I am all sold out of the
traditional awesomesauce network logo
shirts but I do have the battery sauce
in stock in a couple sizes go ahead and
check those out also Paul has glassware
he's got shirts he's gone you know you
should just really have some glasses you
should have like some poles hardware
glasses thank god you're back ok things
have deteriorated at an alarming rate
are you doing
I'm doing fine okay I'm doing fine it
was it was completely dark downstairs
was it really ireia I at first I was
like I'm gonna have to feel my way
through here and I realized i have a
flashlight on my phone we also do have
electricity in the house you could have
turned on a light so I don't know where
your light switches are and it was
literally too dark to see like my
grandparents have this weird habit or
that's just how they roll because they
were like born in the jungle of just
sitting downstairs in the living room
with all the lights completely off
that's cool didn't know anything I'm not
against that I just it was I was
surprised but it was creeping when I
first moved in because I didn't know
they did that so I come home and to be
like 11 p.m. at night and I'd be with
having like sure you wanna get something
from the kitchen we wanted they can just
like pitch black like welcome home well
it's like they just can't be there so
since Lee since then after finding out
that information we we call them grand
pyres because they like to chill in the
time in the pitch-black dark seeress
they're allergic to life how far did you
get I just talked about our shirts I did
want to also mention the whole epic
pants calm if you will yeah show them
that so epic pants calm is I'm sure many
of you are familiar with its where Logan
from text in the kit sells all of his
awesome merchandise the reason why we're
showing you this even though it's not my
or pulse tour is because now you can get
combined shipping discounts from all
three of our stores because we all go
through the same t-shirt guy Logan
actually referred us Paul and I to this
guy his name's John he's really awesome
this is this this shirt here yes I magic
I'm gonna take credit for this shirt
this shirt was my idea oh nice yes
really yes we came yeah there should be
a Paul's hardware logo on the back of
their some you should or some kind of
like your cereal truth your signature in
the bottom right so go ahead and buy
stuff from all of us is the point
they're trying to make there's also once
it gets shipped together you did you get
a refund for part of the shipping costs
you won't see the refund when you're
checking out if you're buying from all
of us you'll get it later but but don't
be worried if you don't see it while
you're checking out another big
announcement and Paul and I have really
been lagging on this but a few weeks
back on the show that was episode 33 or
so we announced that we were looking for
a new awesome hardware logo
and we did forget to mention this in
part a of the show but since then you
guys have been doing a great job of
tweeting us your pictures and your ideas
and your concept and your logos and your
designs to both of our Twitter accounts
and I just wanted to say that we lost
all that and we no longer have any
of it because we're irresponsible adults
that are basically children I think he
sighed both of us were under the
impression that the other person every
time they got a tweet with the picture
was like gathering them and then I was
like did you do that and it goes like no
did you do that and I was like no so we
saw many of them were incredibly
appreciative for all those that were
sent in but if you happen to do a design
please drop it in an email you send it
to awesome hardware rules @ gmail.com
right awesome hardware rules @ gmail.com
rules spelled regularly are you le s
right nosy yeah no Z's in there we're
not 12 so that way we can keep track of
all your logos and designs and will
actually pick one of them relatively
soon we're going to give you guys a week
or so I'm gonna say just to send in
those designs again again if you already
send it to us on Twitter email it to us
the same design that you had originally
because we lost it and if you if we
happen to choose your logo or we get
inspired by your logo for our next
t-shirt design our next first-ever joint
awesome hardware t-shirt then you'll
definitely get some some prizes sent
your way for both of us and that's
pretty much it for announcements that
will be pleasant is very important also
if you order something both about either
of our stores during the show will yell
jump today yes and it will it will scare
you and arouse you and it will be good
at the same time let's move on to news
the first segment of this part of the
show starting with DirectX 12 and all
the beautiful things that Microsoft has
implement implemented into it in
particular we're going to be talking
about multi adapter functionality in
this this nude low-level API which is
really interesting because it allows you
to essentially allows the developers to
basically combine different or
dissimilar GPUs in a multi-gpu setup
eyes right now we're you know very used
to like a you have a 980 I you better
get a second 980 TI if you want to take
advantage of sli oh you got a 7870
better get another one
those if you want to take advantage of
crossfire X so what this does is it
essentially grants the developers of the
games more control with multi GPU
rendering and an antec they actually got
a special exclusive build of ashes of
the singularity very popular the
first-ever DirectX 12 game that actually
allows for this kind of feature this
multi-gpu explicit multi adapter
functionality is what they're calling it
AKA multi display adapter fury x and a
980 TI here in the same system right and
before this whole article before this
phenomenon that would be a no no or
would just be purposeless because we
wouldn't really soon work but you can
only use one GP or the other exactly it
would be fruitless but that that has all
changed now not only can you combine
dissimilar GPUs but the performance
gains that you can see from them is
actually more impressive than you might
think originally Wow yeah so with with
their testing I don't know if you're
still yeah this is the Atlantic article
if you go to the one specific page with
the high-end video card comparisons
they've got a bunch of charts and stuff
rights yes so go to the one down yeah
that one hi ng peas you scroll down
you'll see the chart that has all the
different combinations of GPUs that
they've tried now this is really
interesting the r9 Theory X and the GTX
980 TI combined takes the lead in this
benchmark of ashes of singularity that
actually topped a 980 TI and a Titan X
when combined which is the fourth one
down and that's with that's with the
fury X is the primary card and then they
also ran it with a 980 TI is a primary
card which got a little bit a little bit
less performance right so what this
tells us is that the order of which card
is in the primary slot at the top
generally makes a difference in
performance which is interesting even an
antec was whoever wrote this article I
forget to at the moment but they are not
really ends with Ryan Smith is not a
hundred percent clear on why this says
it could have to do with how each
individual vendor event of GPU how
optimize their drivers are for single
card implementation or something like
that but this is kind of unprecedented
and we haven't really seen this too much
before at all in the
world of PC gaming having two dissimilar
GPUs working synchronously and actually
getting fairly decent results now
unfortunately an antec wasn't able
unable to show us any kind of results
for same card performance in ashes of
singularity because the specific
benchmark that they were given from the
developer oxide was only built with
explicit multi-gpu rendering enables
that you'd have to get a separate build
that included both explicit and implicit
GPU rendering which would allow then
your more traditional sli or crossfire
configurations so again very early alpha
testing I mean this isn't even an alpha
so again this is all very preliminary
and very you know I don't know early
early too early to tell if this is a
real world representation but it still
is interesting because it's the only
thing we have to base off as of now and
it should still be considered at least
with a grain of salt so there's a lot of
questions that this brings up as well
right so for example which which team or
will you know team red or team green
which which card or vendors set of
technologies are you actually going to
benefit from if you have both of them in
your system so you know if you have like
like in the example if you have a 980 I
and a theory x do you only get one or
the other do you only get gameworks or
you only get gaming evolved or you know
do you get free sync or g-sync or does
it matter or does the order of the cards
that it's being placed in your
motherboard does that affect which kind
of technologies do you get access to
there's a lot of questions here also
will you be able to switch your GPU
positioning when when having a discrete
card with an igp you because this is
also supporting integrated graphics so
for like a laptop for example DirectX 12
laptop that's fully supported and
DirectX 12 game like ashes of
singularity if you have an igp you plus
a discrete you know mobile GPU or now
even a full fully blown desktop GPU
inside how do you actually change or
will you be able to change the
positioning of those GPUs based on their
effectiveness and based on the
performance gains that you might see
from either configuration there's just a
lot of things surrounding this what does
this mean
for AMD and NVIDIA right is this a good
thing for for Team Red Team Green you
know maybe team Reds excited because
means more people are going to start
piggybacking on I mean this this is a
good result to say that you know the
fury X is actually more effective when
it in tandem with an IATI then then a
tight Nexus I think that is probably a
plus for 14 red we can say yeah but
again very early to say for sure I would
yeah i mean i would also be curious like
you know and NVIDIA has been known in
the past to block certain things and
software with drivers right so you know
what they're working with right now
might be you know cobbled together
drivers or special versions of the
software whatever that they're actually
testing this with like will nvidia will
AMD for that matter be okay with this
cross pollution of their products with
the competitors products right um when
is that something that they might decide
to disable via you know via software
according to parts in this article it's
not really up to AMD or nvidia whether
or not this is enabled basically one of
the one of the features of DirectX 12 is
that it puts multi-gpu rendering in the
hands of the developer and no longer in
the drivers themselves that's why
they're able to actually combine two
dissimilar GPUs so it's more so you know
it will they try to find a new way to
kind of disable it you know is there's
always a workaround right maybe there's
a way that they can make a distant
disadvantageous even though they can't
disable it completely but our people
even going to want to mix it I'll see
you it also like introduces an
interesting question would come when it
comes to like what kind of system do you
want to build for gaming because if we
can assume based on this that Intel's
integrated graphics with their
processors are also going to be a party
to this then you might say if you were
to get a hand enthusiast processor from
Intel that doesn't have an igp you and
then you're testing in a Direct X 12
environment that can take advantage of
any of the GPUs that are available then
you might get better performance with a
mainstream processor that has an IG I
GPU versus knots you know an enthusiast
process that costs 200 or 500 or a
thousand dollars right
first reward yeah just more money yeah
yeah so that that's an interesting
question as well I was like the AMD dual
graphics when they came out with it it
implementation why's it didn't make a
whole lot of sense but I'm I liked the
idea behind it because you could get
that apu and then you add a graphics
card and kind of combine them together
it was really limited but if Direct X 12
could open that up to make it much more
like brand agnostic like you know you
could use whatever the heck he wants
round you know upgrade your graphics
card leave the old graphics card in and
get some additional performance that's
that's exciting i mean i think it i
think it assuming it works you know that
broadly ram it's pretty cool but I mean
there's there's still a lot of wait and
see I think going on too yeah absolutely
so uh guys let us know in chat what you
think of this whole ordeal personally I
don't know if let let us know in chat if
you would be willing to crossbreed two
different GPUs from Team Red Team Green
solely for performance because obviously
you know there's the whole ordeal of you
know maybe they don't look as complete
or they don't sync with each other
aesthetically in the same system but if
it's a matter of performance you know is
that enough to sway your decision into
buying both from opposing sides but then
also we don't really know what this says
until we see the same card benchmarks in
this game for the same test yeah because
if two gtx 980 is simply outperforms ni
a TI and a theory x then you it's kind
of a moot point we're not really too
concerned anymore so again very early to
tell but very interesting nonetheless
next up rock band for makers the
developers for this game that just
launched recently has done very well so
far I might add they have been caught
posting five star reviews on Amazon
they're excited about their product did
they not just hear about though did they
not just watch awesome hardware last yak
when we talk about is on suing like a
thousand something clearly they're not
followers of the show and they should be
punished but here's what happened a
bunch of amp amp I'm sorry rock band
developers also people who work for the
publisher
harmonics of the game they posted a
bunch of really positive reviews I you
know obviously of the game on Amazon 7
reviews to be exact were found by a
redditor who was very inquisitive this
is hilarious they just use their they
use the real names how did they find
them out it's because they use the real
names but they did actually buy it
they're verified owners yeah okay but
still there's a little bit of dishonesty
here I feel I mean clearly they're
biased and Harmonix has already admitted
the mistake and they've said sorry and
stuff so I don't know this this this
just happened and we could probably find
some way to turn this into a sword fight
of course but this isn't your half of
the show and it's not a sword fight so I
can't do it damn you for taking that
segment I know I hate you it's so good
ever since day one it's so good so yeah
although all the reviews on rock band 4
that you read online don't trust any of
them no I shouldn't say that it's it's
just the ones on amazon postage i buy
names that happen to also be like listed
on linkedin as they work for ya take
take seven of the five star reviews and
just disregard those cool all right next
up we've got a crazy quite literally a
crazy mod for GTA 5 yet again the mods
just keep pouring in as as I would hope
and expect them to this one revolves
around the Hulk so you see right here
Bruce Banner just looks like a regular
dude right and a wifebeater like like
Bruce Bennett and then boom I mean I
would have liked to see his torn clothes
on the ground that would have really
added a little bit but you can do some
crazy here for example you can jump
leap super high in the air and when you
land you kind of do an AoE destructive
blast around you from the impact which
is cool cars go you know up in the air
people go flying of course you can run
through pedestrians and you can even
pick up pedestrians and cars pretty much
almost anything in the game that's
liftable you can pick it up dumpsters
and throw them into other objects as you
see fit you can also rip light poles
straight out of the ground and just use
it as a melee weapon like as a baseball
bat
you can also derail trains upon
collision or jumping there's also a
weird kind of Hulk clap that that he
does he literally just like claps really
loud and it kind of creates a sonic boom
that sends anything in front of the Hulk
flying into oblivion just ridiculous is
a there's some clipping issues here and
there but it's a mod yes I'm trying to
find him do the clap I found him picking
up some cars and throwing them you can
name the cars as you would anything that
you're holding in Ryan grand theft auto
oh he's got the police officer yeah just
check the police office through him so
hard that it moved the car there's the
class that was lap so kind of a nice
little impact their lap see ya dad does
a little big big boom in front of it
boom cool you can also spawn a Hulk
enemy they didn't really specify what
that meant I'm thinking it's just
another Hulk that's AI that you can
battle against that'd be cool I didn't
show in the video but if you are looking
for a challenge you can try taking on a
version of yourself nice yeah gives you
something to actually fight against yes
good idea so go ahead and download that
at your own risk because it can be
infected with viruses anyway moving on
to the next story we've got another
fallout 4 story that building a little
bit off of Paul's he did briefly mention
fallout 4 it was for something somewhat
unrelated but we are yet again talking
about nvidia here because holla later
the same game well yes but I mean what
the thing you I'm sorry load for watches
on November 10 to 12 I think this 10th
I'm it's gonna be available for pre load
so you can preload it before it actually
launches right yes okay so we are
talking about the same game game works
fallout 4 is going to feature game works
oh boy oh boy now I do have a straw poll
to go along with this story because it
is a bit of a controversial debate the
whole game works issue my question r
after that is how does the
implementation of game works in a game
affect your purchasing decision of that
said game so going back I mean remember
which are 3 launch as well as project
cars there is a big huge controversy
with game works being implemented into
each of those and how it kind of stifled
the performance or was you know
allegedly
stifling the performance of AMD graphics
users where they weren't seeing as high
a frame rates as their nvidia or team
green counterparts and a lot of people
were saying it was kind of a black box
solution that was just impossible to
work with the developer said it wasn't
anything on their end that you know
there were some claims and allegations
that you know nvidia had purposely made
the technologies of gameworks run better
or more optimized for for NVIDIA
hardware so is this a toxic or is this
it you know is this toxic to the gaming
industry there's all these questions
anyway NVIDIA has aimed to solve some of
this by releasing brand agnostic arms
I'm sorry for releasing like license
licensing for their source code so
they're making it a bit more open source
than it was before they've made some
efforts to kind of appease the the
community more or less also in games
like Witcher 3 there's now options for
you to adjust the setting of your hair
works for example so instead of just
being completely crushed by enabling
game works only having like a simple
on/off toggle setting you can adjust the
different anti-aliasing or the
granularity of the anti-aliasing for
hair work so that it's not as taxing you
have a bit more flexibility there anyway
for fallout 4 it's going to be featuring
a lot of these settings from features
and game works including ambient
occlusion to shadowing and all sorts of
different lighting effects and the
question I have is is this going to be
an issue for a lot of gamers now has
nvidia already overstepped their bounds
and ruined the reputation of gameworks
or has this kind of blown over and no
one cares anymore and it's just like if
I like the game I'm going to deal with
it it's game works i'll get around it I
just don't know what where the community
lies anymore because it's already been
several weeks if not months since since
this whole debacle so that's why hence
the straw poll I'm curious to know what
you guys think and also what also
there's another whoa I actually forgot
one big point though the minimum
requirements for follow for our have
been released and they're quite
interesting because on one end it says
you need a G
TX 550 Ti oh that's pretty easy to run
the game and on the other hand you've
also got a requirement for a radeon HD
7870 that is a much more powerful car
than a gtx 550 TI kyle right so does
this have any implication to you know or
is this any kind of indication that game
works is going to once again be
affecting or favoring nvidia hardware
obviously minimum requirements are just
you know sometimes their hair hearsay
and they're not always completely
relevant or indicative of what kind of
hardware you need to run the game but
the fact that it lists here you know a
team red card that's almost twice as
fast as the team green card to run the
same game can be a bit concerning for
for some you know AMD users but again
we'll we'll see how it have it all plays
I wait for those benchmarks yeah so
speculation right now let's see what the
what the straw poll says oh you have it
a struggle see what you guys think that
game works nobody cares no one cares i
could care less yes I'll buy game with
or without it indifference is bore I
disapprove but I'll still buy it anyway
right I had a feeling that would rank
pretty high up there as well only a few
people who feel it's crippling the
industry which I mean yeah you could
argue both sides you could argue the
side of the of the consumer you know I
just want to buy the game that just came
out and play it on my hardware and it
should play as good as it complain my
hardware right whereas on the side of
you know if you're looking at a video
Randy for that matter I mean it video I
think it's gets thing they've done more
stuff with game works I think to warrant
some of the criticisms they get right
but yeah you don't want it to be
specially designed just for the one
graphics card that had for the series of
graphics cards it happens to be the
opposite team from the graphics card
that you currently have so right but I
mean nvidia for their part would say
well we're trying to differentiate you
know our products we're trying to show
here's what here's the benefit you get
by going within a video product and
stuff like that so right i tend to take
the side of the consumer however
yeah it's always difficult to wear draw
the line but anyway that wraps it up for
tech news moving on to our next segment
we've got some hot and heavy hardware or
if we do to talk about let's see one two
three four four items that I wanted to
discuss today very exciting the first of
which is the MXC rs.100 SSD it is an LED
SSD the first of its kind never before
seen it actually features a built-in LED
accent lighting around it as well as the
effexor logo can change colors are
actually it doesn't change colors but it
does more of a breathing effect you can
buy different models in different colors
so you guys can buy this war gut
according to their video God requested
this God has put in a request they
started with the Bible Bible quoting God
said let there be light and then a
vexare but also from the video yes see
that's a pretty pretty bold statement of
a nice series the exterior has some
really cool light up hardware they got
the plasma like the like that memory
with the plasma on it and all that kind
of stuff breath under it's pretty cool
looking but ultimately it's just lights
you know yeah so performance is pretty
much expected it's nothing out of the
ordinary it's 544 50 megabytes per
second reading rights respectively
80,000 I ops at random 4k right
capacities are pretty standard 120 240
and 480 in various LED color options as
I mentioned can you tell which of these
two one says the LED lights on it that
one this one that one's the one on the
right that one that's lighting up I
didn't even know there was an SSD there
so it's to Turk I had no idea like look
at the difference this one's lighting up
looks thick it looks it looks like it's
got way more than that seven or nine
millimeters either that's one thing I
was going to say it looks it looks a bit
fatter than a standard 7 millimeter
drive even a 9 millimeter but guess what
Paul what if you liked this SSD and you
want it to be made and manufactured so
you can buy it eventually you can
actually support them on IndieGoGo yeah
IndieGoGo keza vexer is now an indie
company that needs your help I don't
know aren't they an established man
facture frogs that's what I thought
that's what I thought so I was a bit
surprised when I saw in this article
that they actually have a crowdfunding
campaign to raise money for this SSD
which doesn't really make sense to me
their goal is $50,000 they've only met
their reaction about 1,500 a fraction of
that and it's been two days I don't know
it doesn't seem like first off well your
battery's low first off my battery's
gonna die and why the hell is a vexer
why are they running an IndieGoGo
campaign I don't know I don't are they
just are they in the like
they're not the biggest memory
manufacturer out there but they're
established I mean they have booths at
that they have a they had a booth at
computex a guarantee costs more than
fifty thousand dollars RG yeah I know
like and it had like way more LEDs on it
yeah a bunch of there's nothing
expensive or cost costly about LED
accent lighting so the fact that they're
just adding the son of the rest easy I
don't know why that's such a big deal I
think it's like it's it's a little bit
in the way of like you know they wanted
to make this product they're tryna get
it approved by whoever at the company
you know makes that makes the calls on
those types of things like no this is
going to cost too much investment of
money and we don't know that we'll be
able to sell them because that's always
a concern for something like this so
we're going to invest some money and
create the products and then the
products aren't going to sell well which
is a legitimate concern if you're making
a standard SATA SSD right now when you
know their status these are still very
good and very popular and very you know
they're all over the place but so maybe
it was just one guys into another
standard so yeah um it's this to me well
clearly no one wants it it reminds me of
like a pre-order situation they're
looking for pre-orders for this product
yeah by people investing in the
IndieGoGo and that's a weird way to do
it yeah it's a little weird it's a
little weird for me I don't know if
you're like a hardware startup if you're
some dude when an idea for a product and
you like made up you know I feel that's
more of what IndieGoGo is for right it's
for like a person or a small group of
people
there's a very small company or
something so what the reason why I'm not
I'm a little hesitant about this is
because I don't want this to be the
first of many large companies to start
following this type of marketing format
where you start to see like Corsairs
Kickstarter page for like their new
strafe keyboard or something like that
yeah because I feel like that kind of
dilutes what these really great websites
are actually for you know independent
startup companies that you know have
something new to the table that don't
have the funding you know what I mean
because otherwise they're gonna get
buried they're gonna get all these indie
companies are going to get buried by
companies like a mixer yeah and I don't
know I don't think that's cool so I
don't know hopefully this this doesn't
go anywhere it doesn't look like it is
it's pretty sad I mean I you and I could
probably have raised more than fifteen
hundred dollars in two days from like
making sausage like my colleague but we
don't know she's a thief from people
because we're just two dudes we're not
like a established manufacturer of
hardware that already sells you know no
one has reason to trust our sausage yeah
that's the crazy thing okay anyway
moving on to the next product this is
the NZXT Hugh Nessus or Hewitt I'm gonna
call it the Hewitt Hewitt because it's
like a tea on the end it sounds cute
it's an LED lighting device so you can
let up your fancy rig make it out look
out glowing glitz in fencing stuff to be
the new standard for a pit my pc here
yes so it's like a little module it's
like about the size of a two and a half
inch drive but much thicker it's got an
LED accent on it itself you basically
plug LED strips into it so they have to
be NZXT branded LED strips I believe you
can host up to 8 LED strips and you can
control the different colors its RGB its
RGB can control through the cam software
which is also NZXT s you know in-house
software that they've created some cool
stuff some cool stuff the LEDs can do
they can react to changes in your pc
thermals so based on you know if your
CPU or GPU gets hot I can change color
there or different audio levels so we
can dance to music essentially and also
your FPS your FPS
that's what it says okay so if you get
really high frame rate your local
computer will like turn red if your FPS
drops below 30 or something something
like that right because you know you're
the LED accent lighting in your computer
is always the best indication of how
your frame rate is this video is pissing
me off because it's just a bunch of
because it's just a bunch of like super
close ups of stuff you have like what
the hell is that what is what is what
are we looking at right this just colors
in my face it's a it's a nerdy ass
ups and yeah I'm gonna call it I'm gonna
call these types of videos videos
because they're really just all for show
they don't teach you anything that
they're not informative it's just like
ooh I candy look at this it looks so
sexy that's a video right there
 video NZXT nice product you heard
it first here yeah I mean this is look
great i really want with it five
requires five volts of DC power connects
to your PC via USB i should add and it's
going to come in and around sixty
dollars USD with it will bore with four
strips included that's all you even get
a magnetic or an adhesive option so
magnetic if you are any case ever or
adhesive if you're lian-li or aluminum a
Luger case is made of aluminum dude I'm
trying to I was trying to think of all
the case manufacturers that only do like
aluminum I cleanly in win like I can't
really think of many others that but
only love to do an aluminum case but not
that are like almost exclusively right
that's what I was trying to go antec
this sim aluminum although that's maybe
older yeah fact the newer stuff I don't
see quite as much with antich know their
new s10 that is a balloon it's like
thick aluminum okay you could always
roseville has some aluminum cases
they're sweet movie on asus has come out
with a new r9 nano that's it's all white
it's a white icing article says because
winter is coming winter sis is a perfect
a perfect GPU to snuggle up with in the
cold cold winter as it does get a little
little warm and toasty it's white
what do you want it's a nano what do you
want for me it's a white frickin man out
is there anything at all different aside
from it being a white shroud is that
there's there's not even any word on a
back plate because they don't have any
images of the PCB itself oh so we don't
know if it's gonna just be a regular PCB
your back plated okay end of november
release is when you can expect it maybe
we'll find out more it's coming sort of
soon yeah a little bit in a month or so
nocturne kitty says OMFG me want okay I
I'm right there with you kitty this does
look pretty sexy will say if you
definitely save you the time and hassle
it would take to spray paint your own r9
fury nano if you were interested in
modding it in the given color indeed but
yeah good on good on a cs4 for switching
it up a bit you know not everyone's into
the red and black theme that asus even
themselves have prided themselves on I'm
saying all the same words now I saw I
saw JJ posting some sweets of this
earlier but I don't think he posted any
pictures of the back of it mm-hmm and
then I think did Josh Shevlin Josh
fractal John yeah he's building a system
I sound tweeting about building a system
but I don't know / have one uh yeah he
does oh it's a light it's the Lightning
line is a 979 7970 right yeah 970 turbo
interesting so he's doing in all white
belt cuz i saw the define our five white
right there I'm doing it always oh
that's not fair you are he has a defined
our five in my that was JJ that was a JJ
post yeah okay but that's gotta be what
Josh you Jesus oh yeah you're right I
don't know 260 600 k he's doing gigabyte
Z 1 70 n gaming 5 motherboard which is
red in black so well maybe it's not
white I don't know red black and white
yeah okay well he's not copying me
completely okay that's okay that's good
um what we're talking about the asus
wait AMD that's all i have to say about
that in our name now it looks cool cool
bien all right
moving on to the next story corsair of
course their strengths strafe RGB just
repeat them RGB this this is easy this
is noisy this is fun with silent cherry
MX switches this is going to also be I'm
gonna save this a lot on this episode
but it's true first of its kind again to
utilize the new cherry MX silent
switches simply called cherry MX silent
alright that's pretty sure so so what
what is the main feature of these
switches you might ask they're really
loud they make so much noise they can be
heard from your way to announce to other
people that you are there because the
people the folks at cherry have a sense
of humor and irony no that's not true at
all okay they're supposed to be there
engineered to be up to thirty percent
quieter when I hate about this article
is that it doesn't say what how much
doesn't say what they're quieter then
there are thirty percent quieter than
what if they're quieter than Browns it's
not much quiet exactly there no no if
they aren't fire in the drummer is
that's a good indication if they're
quieter than like and blue MX greens and
yeah greens then right so hmm hmm hmm um
how do they do this no there's no rubber
o-rings they're not using o-rings that's
for the plebs yo cherry MX silence which
is using demonstrate this what are you
doing here leave oh okay so we have the
graph right here we totally plan this
this is a new cherry MX sound switch
right here you can see it's much quieter
doesn't make any noise tip and soft and
then you basically are here here's the
deal it uses a patented fully integrated
noise reduction system that's built into
every key okay so no rings it's just
completely built in natively greatly
reducing the bottoming out and the
spring back noise that's the spring and
you also do you also do get the tactile
feel although there was no mention of of
whether or not there's gonna be that
bump if you look right oops I'm sorry
lightly brush my nipple there sorry this
has the switch is so pitch allure so
tantalizing and of course other than
that you're going to get full RGB
lighting a single USB 2.0 custom key
caps for fbsm oba hundred
Oh 160 that's right it's not 10 keyless
quick de pena here's a picture of it
again yes courser has an exclusive on
these that I know right and it is a
little bit of a different design than
the current boards the strafe get some
texture and some of the keys there and
that kind of thing yeah interesting yeah
it comes with custom key caps for you
know your WASD standard qwe are corsair
goes through a lot of cherry switches
yes they do they tend to pop the cherry
they go through like an obscene amount
of cherry swishes yes they do it's crazy
ah that's pretty much all i have to say
for hot and heavy hardware so we can go
ahead and move on to our next segment
let's see ever so popular okay my pc ooh
the blatant ripoff segment from matt
philly at squash and TV his his show
pimp my setup is really great and it's
better than ours because it came first
he actually created it and then we
ripped him off because that's how we
roll here at awesome hardware that go
ahead and check him out if I case should
update our lower thirds forfeit my pc
yeah i think people are sorry this room
working for you like what the hell the
hell does that mean there's ostriches oh
come on it's it's brilliant this is an
internet it all makes sense starting off
with skull chula skull chula just called
sculptural I hunter he has a 3570k based
system at 4.2 gigahertz a 750 ti and h80
liquid cooler eight gigs of ram right
RGB colour changing / white theme what
case is this this is a striker striker
no no it's not striker would have a
scout it's a scam storm scout that's
small yes gets scattered white yeah it
is RGB this it is it's a Hail it's an
NZXT power supply to hail 80 well you
know the fans are rgb2 up top it looks
like they aren't or a GV right they look
that will they look like they're moldy
i'll definitely multi-colored up on top
it's gonna cool
so basically you've just got like a
party going on here it is a party a bit
of a rave there's there's no real like
hardcore color scheme here because I
think you've just designed this case to
be flexible or the system to be flexible
with the RGB LEDs everywhere but
internally your components wise you've
got blue memory within your RAM actually
has blue LEDs on that so I mean unless
your RAM LED accents were RGB as well
it's kind of difficult to match that
with every other color on the spectrum
you've also got a white power supply and
a white rim it looks like or going
around your radiator fan for that course
air cooler so white very neutral the
thing that the great thing about having
a white case and and RGB LEDs is that
the white will just reflect any color
that you assign the LEDs to yeah so you
can kind of have any color system you
want any time but when you throw in the
blue LEDs on the RAM for instance it
kind of throws that off a little bit
becomes a bit more noticeable so that's
probably the one thing that I would say
aesthetic wise if you wanted to really
have that flexibility granted if you
wanted to be blue and you wanted a blue
theme there's probably no better ram
than those sticks that you have in there
already yeah as as we usually say with
the pin my pc could use a little bit of
work on the cable management it's not
bad by any stretch and you've got some
white cable extensions on there these
could just be cinched up they could be a
little bit totter maybe consider even a
cable comb if you want to look really
nice both the 24-pin and your your six
pin for your graphics card there they
could just be cinched up a little bit
more I also noticed your fan is facing
up on the power supply which isn't bad
it's probably just fine I would have
faced it down in this case because you
do have a you have a direct you know
there's this analyst ventilation down
there so um you would you allow it to
pull in a fresh air from outside the
case rather than pulling in warmer air
from inside and also that kind of leaves
leaves your power supply open to just
sucking in any kind of little screws or
anything this might fall into it I've
had that happen before the power supply
is mounted up and you know your undoing
the radiator your fans
whatever at the top of your case and
just like a screw slips happens all the
time and follow straight into your power
supply you got to shake it out take the
whole system and put it upside down to
get out of there so if you have the if
you have if you have a case that can
handle it go ahead and flip it other
than that nice looking system I think
functionally looks really well Oh what
Mother of Jesus what mother of Jesus I
just saw some what happened look at the
top of the hard drive cage what is that
what is that the others an apple looking
that is an apple sticker that is a
sneaky mother of God maybe it's a
hackintosh mmm-hmm what no I just want
to be dramatic look I got I got nothing
against well stickers sticker to fight
his way I look at it like if you're at
all if you're an all Apple user and you
buy all the Apple pre-made products and
everything that's fine it works for you
sure sure you know no problem no
problems there but you know if you want
to build a computer and make a
hackintosh and load Apple's operating
system onto it it's actually like can be
more challenging than building just a
standard computer with the windows or
linux even for that matter right right
so I don't I try not to hate on the on
the hackintosh a--'s and the people who
throw with a focus in there although
chad is Chet Chet would just prove
strong that is disagreeing with me
strongly right now but I mean that's
what what can I say yeah look if you're
buying your own hardware any building
you own systems and you should have the
freedom to use whatever software you I
agree and I will say that if it if this
is if this is a hackintosh build then it
makes a lot more sense yes it would all
right thank you very much skull chua for
sending that system in go ahead and
hopefully you'll survive the rest of the
show with chat on your ass now next
system we've got is from ken ken thank
you for sending this magic gear on
Twitter logic gear yes we've played
several games together and Ken's awesome
guy got a 46 90k yes znat 7 gaming 5 gtx
760 superclocked eight gigs of sniper
gd-r gd-r ddr3 memory from g.skill right
and i always got the pc part picker link
there too so we'll look at that in just
a second but Kyle any immediate thoughts
from the build overall so first off this
is actually a pretty clean-looking
system cable management is
actually not something I need to really
point out here everything looks really
clean if I'm getting really nitpicky I I
do see that there's a kind of a fan
cable that's that's going drooping down
from your rear exhaust that looks like
it's going to a port that's near your
cpu cooler up here which I guess can be
routed a little bit more cleanly or in
the very top left there's also a cable
that's kind of coming from the corner
there but again super nit picky here
color coordination is good I think there
are some things that you can do to spice
it up if you really wanted to you could
get some black and red sleeved cables if
you know if you're not in the if you're
if you're not willing to actually spend
the time to create your own custom
cables because it is very time-consuming
you can check out cable mod they they
kind of customize it for you as well or
mainframe customs will actually do some
really high intelius leaving for you
that you can pretty much tell them
exactly what you want and then because I
think there's a lot of potential for
more integration of red because you have
you already have a lot of red accents on
your motherboard but nothing else in the
case really stands out as as such so
maybe having some red cables in there I
would probably take off the power supply
EVGA g2 power supplies are really
reliable and I like them a lot are you
but they're still be looking at the
single picture on Twitter yes there's
like five really good pictures on the pc
/ Picard link are there yeah are they
he's getting he's got blue LEDs in sight
for example are they all are they
different from what I'm seeing yes oh
this is it I've been showing them to
chat sorry there's blue LEDs inside
which is I have to assume those are blue
there's a chance they're white but I
think they're blue they're only white if
the cameras acting weird or something
like that again with these cleaner
pictures your cable management looks
really nice looks good with the side
panel on love the derp squad sticker on
your sticker always representing yeah
but but still everything I said go like
you say to plug on one of your hard
drives is about to pop out that's my
only feedback this could just be a
little loose justices a little crooked
yeah it's probably still works though
but other than that man other than you
know spicing it up with some cables
may be upgrading your cooler in the
future if you're going to be doing some
more heavy overclocking something that
looks a little bit more but with a with
a hyper 212 you've got ninety
ninety-five percent of anything you're
going oh yeah of course I just mean on
like the aesthetics front honestly this
is a really good solid build I wouldn't
change much Thank You logic here next up
we've got all of our other Oliver I love
a twist Oliver toad Oliver Oliver toad
Oh phone he duct-taped the psu logo and
he has a build log on PC part picker
nice all right nice thank you for also
taking lots of good pictures with the
ample lighting here just taking a glance
at the interior the main section of your
system there's a lot of work that can be
done with the cables the one that stands
out to me the most actually two of them
is the one that's going right over your
cpu cooler you could easily route that
around it because it just looks really
nasty going straight over the fan blades
and also it's probably not the best idea
just in case you know somehow the cable
gets pushed in it gets snagged on on
that fan I mean it's a pretty sharp Finn
because it's a smaller blade and it has
to spin faster rpms I've gotten nicked a
couple times on intel stock coolers so
probably not the best idea to have the
the cable right in front of it just
looks a little a little messy as well
also the rear exhaust fan again there's
just this droopy cable that could be
routed you know you can actually zip tie
a good portion of excess cable from from
any cable in your case really and kind
of tuck it away I usually for the rear
exhaust I like to zip tie my cable as
short as possible and then put it stick
it behind the actual fan so you can't
see it and then I route it through like
you know the Rio Rio you know if I can
between like the intel gigabit ethernet
and not important this red arrow is
pointing at what is the red arrow
pointing at I'm confused
halation these are hex is a hex Vince
I'm really not sure all right also bear
mine you're looking at the one of the
build log pictures there's no graphics
card in there yet ah God what's cards
comes in there later let's see oh wow
there's a lot of hunters here I will say
you have lots of room on your desk and
don't put your computer on the floor
yeah even though it's kind of clean down
there either get it something that puts
it a couple feet up above a little stand
or something a little bookshelf for
something to pop that up on make a shelf
on the wall put it up there or just put
it on top of the desk because there's
lots of room on top of the desk that
yeah definitely yeah looking at these
other pictures that Paul pointed out it
does look a lot cleaner and you've got a
pretty strong you know black and black
and blue theme going on here deepcool
case too we don't see a deep pools
pretty big company but I don't see a
whole lot of their cases around yeah
maybe more popular in the Eastern
countries but thank you very much for
that Oliver I love a toad next up we've
got spunky chickens spunky chickens
let's see if his rig is as spunky as his
name with a flickr album flickr good old
flickr so we got the shot of the desk
desk shot looks pretty clean there I
like the wooden basketball hoop game
game wow this is the same case he's me
just saying don't see many deep cool
cases why exact one no yeah my goodness
what are the odds that is crazy to
conspiracy next week on conspiracy
theories right so why is there a picture
of money we are kind of missing here's
here's kind of a wide shot of the case
alright a power supply mmm there's some
serious cable management issues going on
here that could be resolved by wreak
abling yeah I also see that your
computer is sitting just right on the
carpet fit which I was about to say
maybe flip that power supply but don't
if you're keeping your computer in the
carpet right there don't leave a power
supply of the van face up firewood
please
please get a just get a piece of plywood
get something yeah I mean you look a few
books yeah books at the carpets look
like really you wanted a couple feet off
but but but I mean if you can just get a
piece of plywood under there it will
provide much if you do that when if you
look here Paul looks like he was just
putting it on the carpet for the
picture-taking okay because look at this
picture I don't know he's not flicker
works he's got it he's got it in a
little shelf on its on a piece of others
a little shelf all right that's that's
player it's still really low though
you're still gonna pull away more dust
into the system you're gonna have to
clean out the dust in that right to
three months earlier than you might have
otherwise oh that's nice I hate these
stupid ads so lending should show me
pictures of money we know you're poor
they put the anyway just just rip
out the power supply and get a new one
yeah and rewire everything watch my
video on cable management there's a
bunch of other good ones too yeah clean
your computer yeah overall it's
functional but um I mean this is this
actually look at the look at toads wait
what suppose his name toad friendly toad
Oliver toad all of your toes look at our
Oliver totes build cuz he's got the same
cases you and different he's got he's
got some pretty decent cable management
going on there some stuff up he's used
to space behind the behind the
motherboard tray yes use todos a good
example cool thanks okay for that one
one more here this is samuel n ste know
you're gonna say samuel jackson say no I
say oh we're so honored to have you or
Sam droid um alright he's build needs a
name guys in chat can we help can we
help Sam out with a name for his build
this is a fractal divine define our five
and FX 8320 a hyper 212 evo cooler asus
m5a97 motherboard two-by-four get
crucial kits and a gigabyte looks like a
gtx 950 7 i'm sorry 750ti graphics card
right so and it looks like he's in a
defined
our five wait no GPU is an msi ar9285
our for that was weird that's definer 5y
there to the power supply looks scary
how come here it says gigabyte GV n 750
OC and over here it says wait anyway all
right oh it was easy a power supply oh
is that I was looking at the motherboard
nothing yeah okay now yeah so honestly
if you had just swapped out all the
cables for black ones it would look like
the little doll the overall look of your
system would go from like a fifty-dollar
rig to like a thousand-dollar rig I mean
that's how just that's just how cheap
ketchup and mustard cables make the
system look yeah if you just had nice
black sleeps cables in there or white or
blue any three of those colors would
work by the way it would just instantly
up the value of the entire system and
also people are calling it the melting
pot okay called or crayola crayola Pink
Panther pulse call it I'm offended about
destructor the merciless just pretty
good one looks wicked aim the heat
blaster like that Medusa takes cables
everywhere don't look it in the eye um
apart from that maybe get some some nice
blue memory sticks get some effects
Ursula memory kit some of exes yeah but
the blue plasma the plasmon said that is
right now you've got those nasty green
you know I mean they're functional but
they're just nasty they're all green yep
yeah most of the visual issues with this
build I think come down to the cabling
on this power supply which is an ocz
power supply ocz doesn't make power
supplies anymore they made some okay
ones when they did make them but um they
also made some bad ones which got them a
bad rap swapping that power supply out
or all the cables and then that SATA
cable like I said I think would be a
huge difference then the memory again is
functional it
stand out that much but that would be
the next step I think yeah getting that
memory swept up thank you very much
Samuel and that's going to conclude pimp
my pc for tonight folks we've got one
more segment which is Q&amp;amp;A Cui's nazy's
as always we take your questions and
give you subpar answers as we always do
yes we put this at the end of the show
so that we're tired and that we just say
whatever pops into our heads yes first
question is from Adam JP tech he
probably didn't even know he was asking
a question whoo it is hyper x Ram food
yes i have got it yes it is taste
delicious it is and doesn't come out
well though it's also non-volatile so it
makes you know it's easy on the stomach
comes out fast not about 1600 megahertz
wait now it's volatile memory nevermind
I was wrong about that tried to make it
I was a noble effort Jeremy joke it just
fell face ok um those questions
questions in chat uh-huh nice jeans no
one's asking questions what's easy looks
sad liquid vs. air lately I've been
leaning towards air I I can't say air
because i have a water-cooled system i
mean i have a full water cool time
either but that's like it's like it's a
separate are you you know like something
like that of course you have the time
and the spare money and and everything
to invest when a liquid cooled system
it's awesome and it's a lot of fun and
it's a challenge and you learn things
and all that stuff so that's great but
when it comes down to just like i'm
building a system should i get an air
cooler or a liquid cooler given in
practically speaking spending 30 to 50
bucks on an air cooler which gets you
95% to the performance of a liquid
cooler and lets you overclock usually
just the exact same amounts and then you
don't have to deal with the potential of
like leaks or like the pump dying or
anything like that yeah air cooling is
just simpler more cost-effective and
everything but um you know if you're if
you're looking for the best and you know
you want you want to build a super sweet
system and you want to have that liquid
cooling and be able to tell people look
it's my water-cooled processor you're
like the way it looks or something and I
mean it's not like you get nothing out
of it liquid cooling is more efficient
it'll cool your processor down more you
might be able to overclock a little bit
more but again if you have a good air
cooler chances are you're going to be
limited by the overclocking capabilities
of your processor or your graphics card
if you're talking about that around more
so than your ability to cool off fast
enough true Saturn's rings coca-cola or
dr. pepper coca cola dr. pepper will you
guys come to pdx land if not this time
around some other time haphazard damage
ass I'm not gonna be able to make it
this time it's like next week right yeah
yeah but that would be an event I'd like
to go to next year this year's like the
first year that we've both been
independent and I've kind of been
focusing on it just a couple main events
that i've tried to go to write next year
I want to try to go to some more like
land events community events that kind
of thing Texan ticket is setting up the
land a big line up and I think it's in
seattle in april and i'm going to
definitely try to go that one nice if
invest in gaming mouse or gaming
keyboard ooh good question honestly if
if they're both equally and you're
in equal need of either or at sidmouth i
would say a depends on how bad i would
say mouse because for the longest time
when it came to keyboards and people are
asking like what keyboard should i get
the answer was a fifteen dollar rubber
dome keyboard that was all don't matter
what brand just get a fifteen dollar
keyboard because that's all you need and
it works just as fine and it's just as
fast and functionally does everything
exactly the same as a mechanical
keyboard mechanical keyboards have a
different feel yes they will last longer
but not necessarily to warrant spending
a hundred dollars versus 15 right five
fifteen dollar keyboards will probably
last just as long as one hundred dollar
mechanical keyboard so yeah for that
reason I take it to mouse because the
mouse is the mouse I mean you get more
out of like the precision of the laser
the optical sensor that you get you
might have more buttons that you can put
on there but yeah I think you can get by
more easily with the 15-dollar keyboard
then with osito amount house that's true
yeah yeah pc building and chill yes oh
yeah every night how goes the steam
controller
the named a nation s I've been using it
here and there I've had a pretty good
time with it so far definitely there's
definitely a learning curve to it and I
need to use it more to get more used to
it but um as a living room option
because you can use it to control the
mouse it's nice it's convenient it's
good good to have that I think it's a
nice addition to the repertoire it's not
for everyone some people it's going to
piss off but I think for people are
willing to like sit and use it for a
while and kind of get used to where the
buttons are and how it reacts and all
that stuff I think it's pretty good
controller and fifty bucks wireless you
know plug-and-play works with windows
all right I think it's pretty decent
it's MK plays as do i get cable
extensions for custom modded for custom
modded ones or do i buy full-length
modded custom sleeve cables dependence
of the power supply that you're working
with yeah some power supplies will like
some manufacturers are to the point
where they offer cable kits you can buy
specifically if you have a fully modular
power supply if you want to be safe
either get get different cables directly
from the manufacturer you bought it for
or just get extensions I would never I
mean I don't know it's I just I wouldn't
really I wouldn't risk buying new
modular cables from anywhere other than
the manufacturer yeah if they cross a
line or something like that the great
thing about extensions is that you can
use them from power supply to power
supply yeah so they're pretty much good
I mean that universal connection isn't
going to change no you're both safe on
that better investment Lord mustang gts
are we doing after show yes we are a no
in fact actually has a question how you
gonna do I'm going to go ahead and post
it in chat right now the question is
what game should we play tonight yeah
there's a couple options Paul is gonna
be playing from my house we are going to
have dinner really quick after we end
the show and then we're going to go
ahead and jump into a game so go ahead
and let us know which game you want us
to play we've got options like rocket
League GTA 5 lovers in a dangerous
space-time which we played a couple
times a few weeks back as well as brawl
holla which is a game that i recently
picked up last night actually been
playing that a little bit here and there
super fun so far it's like a super smash
brothers l type of i wouldn't say it's a
clone it's kind of on its own then
you'll probably kick my ass at it ah but
that's okay probably but yes yes if you
guys want to see ask
is paul got his ass beat in that game go
ahead and vote for that one but yes this
is also subject to being overruled so
you might be like oh I want you to play
GTA 5 and will still say no they don't
feel like it so this is just really to
make you feel like you have an illusion
of choice anyway I think that's pretty
much all we have to say for the show no
thank you guys for joining us for
episode 36 go ahead and hit that like
