2016 is brought to you by need for seat
go to need for seat USA comp for the
ultimate gaming chair experience for
your desk in office and Corsair they
make good products and you should buy
them what's up guys welcome back to
coverage of CES 2016 on awesomesauce
network I'm here chillin with Brian from
fantex how's it going Brian good good is
it really going good though it's going
good well I walked in here and there's a
lot of stuff going on but I kind of
narrowed it down to just a few
particular new things that you guys have
here speaking of which we've got this
Eclipse p400 is that correct what tell
me tell me about this new case what's
what's new with it well this is our new
series the Eclipse series it's gonna
have two different models the P 400 and
the p400s the main difference between
those two the P 400 is gonna be our base
model no bells and whistles just a
straightforward case the p400s is gonna
be a slightly upgraded version with
dampers on all panels the left and right
side as well as a front it also comes
with a three-speed fan controller both
versions of the case will be available
in all three colors black white and
anthracite gray these are these fan
controllers touch operated capacitive
touch the buttons are actually located
beneath the panel oh yeah okay gotcha
so there's a physical button underneath
there but but it's kind of stealthily
hidden so it cleans up the aesthetic
nice yes and also it comes with a 10
color LED controller similar to the one
found on the deluxe and you've already
got some LED strips in here which don't
come included with the case but you can
buy those from the fantex website
correct that's correct the additional
LED strips come in one meter and two
meter lengths gotcha and how many how
many drives do these cases support it
comes with two three and a half inch
drives on the bottom and then you have
the option to upgrade to four additional
three and a half inch drives if you
bought the modular HDD bracket okay
awesome and I also like the kind of like
the really minimalistic style here I see
you guys have been omitted the five and
a quarter inch Bay which not honestly
not many people utilize these days but
yet you still have a lot of good airflow
coming up from the top here and I
believe there's ventilation at the
bottom as well filtered air from the top
and the bottom you can fit up to a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator in
the front which should provide good
cooling for any
CPU or even a GPU yeah I like I like how
the how you've also stuck with the
really modular drive trays here on the
side so you can kind of remove them if
you don't if you're not using them and
that really opens up a lot more airflow
whether you're installing fans or for
that 360 radiator you could you have
more than enough room for for exactly
awesome well thanks I see a bunch of
other stuff around here but I'm gonna
let you do your thing you got a lot of
other things to do here at CES but
thanks for your time I'm gonna go ahead
and walk around and mess things up at
your at your suite here is that cool
thanks all right guys check this out
this is the pro-am but it looks a little
bit different right
it's a 89 $99 case originally but for 10
bucks more you can actually get this
really nice clean looking acrylic window
so you can see all the innards of your
case this when I first saw this in
person you can't really tell from the
camera but it looks like tempered glass
but I don't think I think fantex has
something against tempered glass and
they would really never use that kind of
material because it's too fragile oh
wait nevermind they do use tempered
glass actually this is their evolved ATX
one $79.99 was the original price for
additional ten bucks just $10 more for
$10 more you can get this beautiful
tempered glass side panel to really show
off the inside on both sides of the case
and not just the the left side but the
back side as well which which is
actually pretty remarkable I'm gonna
give a shout out and kind of poke fun at
Dimitri from hardware connects right now
because he just built an awesome killer
system in the original evolved ATX but
he has the old window and Dimitri you're
probably killing yourself right now but
but I hope you're I hope you stay alive
for when I meet you later at CES but
that's pretty much it for this part of
fant --ax no no we have more stuff over
there let's go over there follow me all
right guys now we are over here on this
section of the fantex
room and we're looking at this beautiful
system right here which is right
currently a prototype but you will be
able to buy this eventually in q3 of
this year this is being called the
project nine one six is this the
official name or this subject to change
it could be subject to change but as of
now this is kind of like the codename
for the other fantex crew but we use
what you essentially have here as a dual
system chassis and you've got a full ATX
motherboard right there you've got a
mini ITX down below this is fully
water-cooled by the way beautiful job
from the guys at fantex but you've also
got some really neat features with the
powers
why there's two power supplies in here
so we've got one in the back here and
we've actually got one behind the
motherboard tray as well now what we're
these motherboards or power supplies are
connecting to is this little combo unit
here and this is also a fan Tech's
innovation what this essentially does is
it allows you to regulate the voltage
that's going through the power supplies
and reaching all the different
components and it's it's it's also a
failsafe so if if one of the power
supplies happens to die the other one
will kind of come to the rescue and back
it up so that your system is continually
powered on so that's a really nice
failsafe bit of technology there also
it's it's just there to provide a bit
more stability in terms of voltage
regulation for overclock so if you're
overclocking your GPUs or your CPUs you
get a little bit more stability with the
combo device as well now from the combo
device we have a bunch of cables going
into there power supply splitter now
that essentially just routes all the
cables it gives you two outputs going to
the single splitter and then out to both
of them other boards in the case so
really just a full full blown like
well-thought-out piece of piece of like
system this is a really great system
that hopefully we'll be able to see in
q3 of this year but that's pretty much
all gonna do it for now here at the
fantex booth for CES 2016 before I go I
