I see oh I love it I mean it's pretty
much perfect I just wish it was a little
smaller that was easy
so here ask for my spicy mini oh wow you
did something useful for once nice spell
check it next time too seriously Heather
what kind of request was that you're
gonna ruin it for everyone the customer
is always right
ladies ladies there's no need to fight
Oh let your voice be heard by visiting
the fractal design contact page and
making a product suggestion within
reason while you're at it you can also
check out the new mesh if I see Minnie
click on the link below to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel today I'll be taking a look at
this brand new CPU cooler from the folks
over at be quiet this is the dark rock
Pro for the long-awaited successor to
the dark rock pro 3 a very highly
regarded CPU cooler however this unit
brings about some much-needed
improvements like a new installation
process as well as a brand new heatsink
design now this is gonna be a pretty
straightforward review but on top of
testing the thermals and acoustics of
this 250 watt TDP unit I'm also kind of
curious at the end of the video if we
can actually get away with running this
thing 100% passively by removing both
the fans I think I think we might be
able to do it honestly I mean it's a
pretty phat heat stack so that's kind of
why I'm curious but more on that later
on now before we dive into the
installation process I wanted to quickly
go over the unit itself for starters we
have this dual heatsink design so you
actually get two towers and they're
pretty pretty fat heat sinks and they
have this sort of wave contoured shape
to them and these little dimples that
are supposed to encourage air so
halation the finns are treated with a
special black coating that actually
promotes heat transfer as opposed to
some cheaper paint materials that can
often insulate the heat additionally we
have some fans here these are silent
wings three high performing fans you get
a 120 on the outside very standard 25
millimeters thick and then a 135
millimeter fan on the inside that's kind
of sandwiched in between both of these
heatsink towers both of the fans are
four pin PWM and they have nice blacks
leaving to match the rest of the cooler
the dual heat sinks are joined by a set
of seven copper heat pipes which also
received the same special black coating
that we saw with the fins themselves you
get a copper base plate at the bottom
and finally a very nice brushed aluminum
finish top cover with these various caps
that just kind of add to the nice unique
aesthetic the cooler supports all of
today's most popular AMD and intel
sockets with the exception of thread
ripper and the installation itself is
pretty straightforward
there's a backplate that you have to
fasten or secure to the back of your
motherboard and there will be four
screws that kind of pop up you basically
have to take four mounting posts screw
those two those screws and then mount
your CPU cooler onto your CPU with some
thermal paste of course next you lay a
single crossbar over your copper plate
and prepare for screwing there's one
screw on either side of that crossbar
that needs to be accessed and the only
way to reach them is by unscrewing two
of the caps on top your aluminum cover
and using the included screw driver to
bolt them down afterwards you can mount
both of the fans using the included wire
brackets which are kind of a pain to use
and can easily scratch some of the
special coating off of the fin stack if
you're not careful if the outer fan is
interfering with your RAM modules
however these wire brackets do allow
enough flexibility to lift that fan ever
so slightly so that you have a bit more
clearance for your memory it's also nice
that be quite includes an additional set
of brackets if you wanted to mount
another 120 millimeter fan to the other
side of the heatsink last but not least
connect both of the fans to the included
fan splitter and then to your
motherboard CPU fan header the
installation does take a bit longer than
most air coolers I'm used to but overall
the process has been simplified and is
much more seamless than that of its
predecessor now that it's installed
let's go ahead and fire it up and do
some testing alright guys so I currently
have our core i7 8700 k-6 core 12 thread
part overclocked at the moment to 4.8
gigahertz at one
point to five volts and that's on top of
a gigabyte horas Z 370 gaming seven
motherboard paired with 16 gigs of
g.skill tried NZ RGB ddr4 at 3200 speed
with the help of the built in XMP
profile we also have a gtx 1070 for the
wind card from EVGA that's running its
stock settings no overclocking on the
GPU and that's all being sort of encased
inside of this mid tower from fractal
design there defined s and I've actually
removed all the top much of nth covers
just so we have as much air flow going
in and out of the case as possible
taking a look at the screen here
evidently we have GTA 5 running at 2560
by 1080 that's 21 by 9 or an ultra wide
resolution and you can see we have an
OSD here that has some Diagnostics
including our package temp on the CPU
which is hovering around 60 degrees
Celsius right now which is fantastic for
an overclocked 8700 k over here in
hardware monitor 71 degrees Celsius is
what the is the hottest our package got
at any time which is actually isn't bad
at all especially when you consider that
it was only at that temperature for
about a second or two before diving back
down to its average range which again is
around 60 C so what I want to do now is
pop off one of those fans actually it
will start with the 120 that's on the
outside of the cooler just to see how it
affects our thermals I'm guessing that
will increase a few degrees but also
reduce some of the noise levels and
that's what got me so excited the
beginning of this video was to see if we
could run this cooler 100% passively but
now that I have it up and running under
full load about an arm's length away
from me it's already really really quiet
and I don't see the need to remove any
fans or tweak it further for acoustic
purposes that being said I'm gonna try
it anyway because I said I would and
because I can so let's go ahead and
start off with popping off that's
popping off start off by popping off
that 120 millimeter fan
all right so run around the streets of
Los Santos once again here this time
with one less fan and it looks like
we're still hovering at around 60
degrees Celsius max package temp 70 C
same as it was last time and there are
no ill signs no thermal throttling of
any kind things are looking good I think
we're ready to remove the second fan to
see once and for all if the dual
heatsink towers can hold their own
alright guys so we've just booted into
windows with zero fans we're now
completely passive and we're launching
steam right now we're not even in game
and we're already hovering at around 80
to 83 degrees Celsius I think we've
reached a tipping point here and we
cannot go any further
in fact the cameras didn't catch this
but we've already besotted three times
since removing the second fan I'm gonna
try seeing what happens if I if I
launched GTA 5 I'm guessing another be
sod and I think the reason why we were
so easily able to ditch that 120
millimeter fan and not the 135 is
because the 135 is right in the middle
it's actually serving a dual purpose
sitting in between both of the heat sink
towers it's pulling air through one heat
sink and pushing air through the other
so it's kind of serving two purposes and
it's working twice as hard if you will
as that outer 120 milliliter fan which
is why it makes such a huge difference
please PC gods please please let us not
be sod Oh God
89 we just hit 89 and there's the B sod
so clearly everything I just said rings
pretty true here as demonstrated by this
beautiful super ultra wide B sod so
immersive so closing things out here I'm
very impressed with the cooler overall
it's definitely exceeded my expectations
in almost every area performances top
notch here honestly I'd put it on par
with a lot of 240 millimeter liquid AAA
OS well I haven't tested against those
directly in this video obviously for my
experience it is best-in-class in terms
of a err CPU cooler
additionally the high TDP at 250 Watts
also indicates that you might want to
pair this cooler with a warmer running
CPU it'd be kind of wasted on something
like horizon 5 CPU or maybe a core i5
8400 for example but if you're gonna be
doing some serious overclocking with a
higher TDP chip this is definitely in
the running as a potential contender
additionally it's quiet AF I mean this
thing is almost silent even if you have
a case that has a lot of open air
ventilation under load you're not gonna
really notice it that much and when you
do it's not going to be distracting it's
sort of a low kind of calming hum
overall and it's it's not going to take
you out of the game whatsoever the
installation
has been much improved upon since the
last generation it's still a bit
long-winded but overall I'm very happy
with the changes that be quiet made
there and then finally I think it just
looks great I think for the money it's
one of the best looking air coolers on
the market
definitely blows any noctua coolers out
of the water noctua coolers perform
fantastic in their own right but from an
aesthetic department this thing
definitely takes the cake between the
two so those are my thoughts in a
nutshell on the dark rock Pro for guys
let me know if you feel the same way in
the comments below
