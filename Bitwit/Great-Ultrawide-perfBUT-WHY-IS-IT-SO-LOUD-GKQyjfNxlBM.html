come over here check out this Tower of
Power
damn and the perfect pair to match oh
yeah go haven't touched him with you
like I can barely put my hands around
the room that's the laughs guy said he
looked me straight in my eyes as he was
feeling him up said you've never seen
anything like it
I can't believe what I'm hearing right
now you guys are disgusting
oh you guys talking about the case fans
oh sorry
continue
did she think we were talking about the
case the new H 500 P from Coolermaster
sports a pair of 200 millimeter RGB fans
generous radiator support and phenomenal
cable management packed in a unique
industrial exterior click the link of
the description to learn more what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
I'm taking a closer look at September's
PC of the month which is the portable
AMD gaming system featuring a Rison 5
CPU and RX Vega 56 graphics card now
instead of testing the system here in
the studio I ended up taking it home
because I was running short on time and
I did all my benchmarks there but the
only moderate that I had at home was the
34 40 by 1440 curve ultra wide IPS
display the Acer predator X 34 so I did
all of my benchmarks on that display and
while I could have dumbed down the
resolution to more conventional 1080p
and 1440p 16 by 9 resolutions I thought
I would switch things up today and just
to run 30 for 40 by 1440 all the way so
hopefully that's cool with you guys
doing something little bit different
today but nonetheless we're still going
to take a look at overall gaming
performance as well as acoustics and
thermals which I'm almost more curious
about inside of the portal chassis here
from Goodell BitFenix because I've never
worked with it before and a lot of
people were commenting in the comments
saying commenting in the comments saying
that you know how does this thing get
air flow it looks like it's completely
closed off are the thermals just
complete shite we're gonna be taking a
closer look at all that as well later
today now diving right in here when
wifey sauce initially built this system
it was with arisin v 1600 but since then
I've had to repurpose that chip for
other things it's the only 1,600 I have
on hand so I've actually dropped in a
1600 X to take its place which is what I
use to conduct all of today's benchmarks
hopefully that's cool the main
differences that we're talking about
here going from a 1600 to a 1600 X is a
higher TDP going from 65 to 95 watts so
we might be introducing a tad more heat
into the equation and then additionally
you know it's probably Costin what 25 to
30 dollars more right now MSRP for that
XQ and then finally you do get a bit
more overclock ability of course silicon
Lottery's is a huge factor here but we
you might be able to squeeze out a
hundred to one hundred and fifty
megahertz more out
your core frequency with an ex-parte
again that's assuming that power and
thermal conditions are all good now that
being said I did manage an all core
overclock on our 1600 X here to three
point eight five gigahertz I did the
temp to three point nine and the system
would crash every time the screen would
actually go black in the middle of
gameplay until I dialed it back about
fifty megahertz and then it seemed
perfectly fine so 3.85 is what we got
away with that was with stock V core was
not touching the voltage whatsoever
ambient temperature in my room at home
is much warmer than it is here in the
studio so please bear that in mind with
these temperature results it was about
eighty degrees Fahrenheit at home but
with that said the CPU temperatures were
hovering in the 70s there abouts with a
max package temp of 83 degrees Celsius
it's definitely not the greatest but it
is under t.j.maxx and we were not seeing
any sort of signs of throttling or
stuttering or anything like that that
might be caused from overheating now in
part one a lot of you guys seemed
curious as to how the CPU and
motherboard in this case receive airflow
because it seems more or less closed off
at the front here but believe it or not
there's actually a 120 millimeter fan
pre-installed at the front of the case
more or less right in the middle that's
aimed straight at the CPU and
motherboard and we do have ventilation
strips at the top and bottom of the case
there's tons of ventilation holes when
you when you see it at first glance but
then you realize there's another layer
of plastic underneath this mesh that has
very few ventilation slots that kind of
limits the amount of air that that
single fan can really bring in which is
kind of a curious design move I'm not
sure why they didn't just leave it as
open as it appears if we had a bit more
open ventilation to the front I'm pretty
sure we'd see the CPU temperatures fall
a couple degrees but speculation of
course but at the very least this system
or this chassis I should say does
support 120 millimeter radiators so if
you wanted to throw in a IO on top of
your CPU you could do that and
potentially drop the temps even further
but moving on here allow me to refresh
your memory as to which Ram kit we're
running here that's the Corsair
Vengeance lpx 16 gigabyte kits that's
two by eight big sticks rated at 3000
megahertz we got them running stable e
at 29 33 close enough I say and that was
using Rison master funny thing about
rising math
it kind of sucks it's been super buggy
for me throughout my testing it was sort
of a bane to work with um the way it
works is you apply all your changes
within the software while you're in the
operating system and then the system
reboots in order for those changes to
take effect but more often than not
every time I would reboot only some of
those changes would have actually taken
place for example the memory would be
running just fine at 2933 but my
overclock on the CPU was just not there
did not apply for whatever reason or
vice-versa it took me about a dozen or
so just random restarts just rebooting
the system turning it off and on again
until finally both changes took effect
and I perceived to run all my benchmarks
quickly before something bad happened at
this point I'm convinced that these are
issues with the software and not the
hardware that we're using so AMD if
you're watching perhaps look into this
and see if there's anything you can do
to make it run a bit smoother but moving
right along with our graphics card we've
got the RX Vega 56 but you can see peer
in through the top window of our case
here the Vega 56 is pretty much AMD's
response to the gtx 1070 from nvidia and
it does compete fairly closely with that
card the one I have here today is the
reference design so we're talking in
close shroud a blower style fan can get
kind of noisy can get a little warm
let's see how it did inside of the
portal here well actually under load
what I noticed at stock settings this
thing was ramping up to about 84 degrees
Celsius so at that point I did not want
to overclock it at all it's a pretty
fast card as is on its own out of the
box I'm leaving it at stock and that's
what I did for the rest of my testing
now again remember I was testing this in
a fairly warm room so your mileage is
going to vary based on a number of
different factors including your own
ambient temperatures of course that
being said there isn't much this case
seems to be doing to help the GPU
thermal situation I mean the graphics
cards mounted in this sort of upper
chamber of the case the PCIe riser card
which puts it apart from the CPU and
motherboard and it seems a bit starved
for airflow in this area I mean there's
a window right here which is nice you
can see through it and see your graphics
car but it doesn't do squat for thermals
and you've got some ventilation from the
front and the back but like I mentioned
before there's a lot less ventilation
going on to these holes than you might
think so overall it seems to be a little
pocket of air that with that single
blower style fan face up facing the the
window it it is quite starved for
airflow and this all sort of makes me
think that perhaps an open-air style
shroud would perform better in this
particular case where you have more area
around the graphics card for in taking
fresh air as opposed to just having that
single blower style fan that's facing
away from any sort of airflow that's
taking place elsewhere in the case now
an unfortunate effect of having a hot
running graphics card is that the fan
tends to spin up a lot faster and make a
lot more noise good news is that you
can't really hear the graphics card fan
like at all the bad news is that the
only reason you can't hear it is because
the power supply fan is so frigging loud
that it drowns out the sound of every
other fan in the system including the
graphics card fan the case fans the
right spire fan this FSP unit that I
took a gamble on did not provide any
worthy returns other than the fact that
it powers the system and it hasn't blown
up yet it is so noisy that that little
fan whatever is in there is making so
much noise whether you're at load or
idle it makes the same constant loud ass
whirring noise that pretty much ruins
the entire experience of the system I
could understand if it was just ramping
up to that level under load because I
could care less I've already got my cans
I'm listening to ingame sound I could
barely hear it anyway but if it's that
loud when I'm just browsing the web or
something it's a huge distraction and it
really puts a damper on the overall
again overall experience that I'm having
so far I guess the RX Vega 56 reference
design card has finally met its match on
an acoustic level but I think we can
talk about benchmarks there's really not
much to talk about I did run five games
just some quick benchmarks to throw at
you using the latest crimson driver at
the time which was 17 9.1 and these are
of course all being run at 34 40 by 1440
21 by nine ultra wide so without further
ado ladies and gentlemen here are your
gaming benchmarks for the portable AMD
game please
alright y'all so those are the results
overall some pretty nice numbers from
our risin 5 &amp;amp; RX Vega 56 pairing 4 of
the 5 games we're seeing well over 60
FPS on average which is fantastic and
that's also great news for users who are
on more common 16 by 9 resolutions 1080p
1440p they're gonna be seeing even more
performance at those pixel count which
is great pub G was the only game of
course that did not top 60fps I think we
got 45 FPS on average 34 fps with our 1%
lows still very playable no jitter no
stud or anything like that however it is
noticeably less smooth than our other
titles of course this is to be expected
as pub G is still in early access it's
not a hundred percent optimized at this
point however a developer blue hole
recently released a patch that optimized
the game for CPUs with more than 4 cores
so the performance scaling we're
actually seeing going from 4 to 6 cores
is massive and you guys should check out
Nathan's article from legit reviews I'll
put it as a link in description below
some fantastic findings they're very
convincing and compelling makes you
really want to upgrade to 6 cores if you
haven't yet especially if you're into
pub G in our case we're definitely taxed
in that 1600 X putting those extra cores
and threads to use however I think we
just need a little bit more GPU F to
take on the game in its current state to
sum things up here the system really
does pack in some decent performance
that allows it to gain comfortably at 34
40 by 1440 where it really falls short
is in the GPU thermals Department of
course that might be able to be improved
upon with a custom board variant for
example we're not really gonna know
until we have one of those in
additionally the noise situation is just
god-awful because of that power supply
if we were to swap that out for a
quieter unit I would imagine that noise
emissions would be somewhat reasonable
in this particular system but that's all
I got for today guys thank you so much
for tuning in let me know what you think
so far of these findings in the comments
below and don't forget to toss me a look
on the video if you enjoyed it before
you guys go you can subscribe to my
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon and until next time I
will see y'all in the net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
