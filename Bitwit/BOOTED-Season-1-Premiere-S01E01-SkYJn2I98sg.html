will check my vitals am I am I here am I
here can you see me can you hear me tell
me right now how things are looking on
your end some I'm gonna go ahead and
check the stream here it looks like it
looks like I'm streaming just just give
me a sign give me a sign I'm waiting for
chat to blow up any minute now yes it
has begun it has begun loading alright
hey dude guys guys and gals mostly gals
mostly dudes I know it's a sausage fest
in here but that's okay thank you so
much for joining this first episode of
this first season of booted my
user-submitted PC livestream where
basically essentially every single month
15 contestants go head-to-head they show
off their their rigs which is a very
brave thing to do on the internet these
days and and I basically just ripped the
 out of them I just talk on all
of them and I give you guys a hard time
no I mean I'm gonna do a little bit of
that but mostly it's gonna be a fair
balance of pros and cons taking a look
at the good and bad of each of these
systems and by the end of it by the end
of each season we will have one winner
that's voted essentially by the live
audience you guys if you're watching us
live yes it's not awesome hardware me if
you're watching me live you will vote on
one of those 15 contestants to take home
the grand prize of a $500 gift card in
either the form of a steam or Amazon
gift card of their choice so the stakes
are pretty high it's kind of like pit my
PC with like brass knuckles on you know
this isn't there's no more child's play
here so first off quick shout out to the
to the homies in chat manic geek Steve
Cell Ethan all you guys who are regulars
thank y'all so much for joining as well
as those who I might not recognize as
much thank you all for being here it's
it's difficult to get to round up the
Internet these days to to watch
something that doesn't exist yet people
have their own agendas and very little
attention span so thank you guys so much
for the support on this first episode
I'm amazed I even got a sponsor for this
episode but before we talk about our
sponsor why don't we go ahead and tell
you what this show is all about because
while I'm sure some of you already are
very familiar with the concept some of
you probably either stumbled upon this
video just by chance or someone told you
to go watch it and you have no idea what
you're doing here
so for those those of you who have no no
clue why don't we go ahead and talk
about how this stream actually works how
this show works and I've got a basically
a little graphic here and you can see
it's already kind of pretty much we've
got three brackets we are in week one
currently we're currently a week one
where we've got five new contestants
four of which will get booted off the
show by you guys I wipe my hands clean
of all you know judge and jury here this
is all up to you guys I give my two
cents about you know JJ don't sue me I
give my two cents about each of these
systems but in the end you guys are
gonna be the ones voting on which one
you feel deserves to win so in week one
we've got five contestants we axe off
four of them one of them is left
remaining as a finalist then we go to
week two same thing five new contestants
four get booted one more finalist and
then week three same deal the third
finalist is chosen and then they all go
on to week four the final round where
those three finalists compete for the
grand prize of $500 again we will be
taking a look in depth at each of these
systems their pros and cons and also in
the final round we'll be taking a look
at their backside cable management for
the first time to kind of reveal like
the skeletons in their closet if you
will to really kind of I guess like
maybe even the odds if there was a neck
and neck that might be a determining
factor for the voting system it really
is all in the hands of the live audience
thank you Steve for the dollar donation
I maybe we'll all work my way up to
taking my shirt off maybe maybe in a
future episode because you know you know
I am cheap like that that's why that's
why Steve's the only one donating right
now is because he knows me well enough
to know that I'll strip for like a
dollar but that's pretty much how it
works guys so hopefully that clears
things up it's a very simple concept
which can be kind of long-winded to
explain especially when I explained it
not the best at explaining things
fluidly but hopefully that graphic
helped you out now before we take a look
at our five contestants sue contestant
number one who's going to be contestant
number one on the first episode of the
first season well we'll get there but
first of all I want to give a huge shout
out to today's sponsor actually not just
a day sponsor but this month's sponsor
which is Fanta X now fantex
super cool websites are a super cool
website they have a cool website too but
they they are a great brand if you guys
aren't familiar with fan texts go ahead
and push that
that you're living under off of your
head and open your eyes and and see the
Sun and see the sky because fantex is a
really great brand they're actually the
first vendor that I approached to
potentially sponsor this show because
I'm a firm believer in their products I
use their cases regularly I have my wife
system is in an empty we evolved ITX
outstanding little mini ITX chassis and
I've also built my white build that I
assembled a few months ago in their
evolved luxe or the enthu luxe excuse me
so all around really solid quality stuff
you can go ahead and check out their
website at fantex com
they've also got these new extension
cables that they're showing off I
actually have a pair a set of these that
I haven't really tested out yet but I
kind of just took them out of the
wrapper and flex them around the really
high quality that they have a few
limiting options black and white which
are really common red also very common
and a red and black which I believe
we're gonna add some more colors in the
future but a good start so far two
sleeve cables I don't like how there's
ads on the site but that's okay
this isn't add it's an ad with an ad
ception we're going ad ception right now
also their power supply splitter which
was really cool they were demoing it
demoing it at CES this year in one of
their new upcoming dual chassis cases if
you don't want to wait for the project
nine one six you can check out their end
through mini XL DS which has been around
for some time now but now with the the
power supply splitter you can actually
take a single power supply and install
into your case and have that power to
individual systems which is really great
this this case is really really the tits
if you asked me because you can do a lot
of like pretty much an infinite amount
of possibilities with it have like one
gaining machine it's a dual its the dual
system chassis essentially you have one
gaming machine in there as well as like
for example a server or or even a stream
machine so you can have a perfect
combination of things to your liking so
thank you so much
fantex for pretty much sponsoring this
season because honestly that $500 grand
prize gift card that's for one of you
lucky winners
that's that wouldn't be possible without
sponsors like fan tech so thank you guys
but enough of this jibber-jabber
Chimay brush matter and I haven't not
been drinking apart from this bottle of
wine that's almost empty so why don't we
go ahead and take a look at our first
contestant of the show my goodness
drumroll please and that's not something
I need to work on too is getting a sound
board for the show so I can do things
like drum roll or like a fart noise you
know like if I just
got to kill time just just mash the fart
noise button it'll kill it'll just kill
it'll kill bro so let's go ahead and
move on to number one PC number one is
from Andrew now I'm labeling these pcs
by number because that's essentially how
you're going to vote on them so if you
like this PC you're gonna vote number
one and that'll all be like you know
more clear when the poll comes out in
chat but more on that later so Andrew
Andrew Andrew Andrew Andrew Andrew what
do you got what do you got for us here
so the case is a a fractal define are
five white and you know what before we
even get into critiquing Andrews build
here there's a couple things that I want
to say on how I'm actually looking at
these systems because for pin my PC it's
all about like giving advice if you guys
are familiar with pin my PC the little
segments that I do with Paul and Paul's
Hardware on our show awesome hardware
which is on Tuesdays 10 my PC is more
like giving suggestions to people who
need it right they're there they're
seeking our help they're seeking our
advice for whatever reason I'll never
know why but it's kind of a helpful
tutorial type thing Q&amp;amp;A type stuff where
you know everyone's having a good time
this is different this is like cutthroat
I'm gonna be more brutal with things
that I see if I if I can point out a
flaw or like some kind of inconsistency
with your build I'm gonna like chew you
out for it I'm gonna like go to town
because that's how dramatic this is
okay it's not it's not all like friendly
hugs and kisses and rainbows all right
that's pin my PC it's child's play it's
child's play so um just just and also
it's it's for theatrics as well don't be
offended if you're a contestant and I
slam your rig for some you know small
point for having a crappy SLI bridge or
something which Andrew does we're gonna
go ahead and talk about that as well but
yeah
just just keep that in mind so I'm gonna
be talking about the system specs kind
of how they mesh together whether or not
they're compatible or if they're a good
fit for each other it's not necessarily
about it's not necessarily about who has
the better video card and better CPU
guys I'm not gonna be like okay you get
extra points for having a 980ti instead
of a 970 that's not really what it's
about it's like do the the components as
a whole match up do you are they are
they compatible with each other do they
make sense is it a sensible matchmaking
of a build so things like that as well
as aesthetics of course you got to throw
aesthetics in there if it looks like
crap I'm gonna dock you
points by the way anytime I mentioned
points in this series they don't mean
anything it's like whose line is it
anyway the points don't mean a damn
thing but if your rig is ugly as hell I
will dock you some points for that so
let's go ahead and move on to Andrew
with that said okay first of all
beautiful case fractal define are five
in white not as popular as the
traditional black steel but the white is
very very attractive and I like that
case a lot especially because it's one
of those white cases that actually has a
painted white interior as well a lot of
times you'll see a white case that still
has a black painted interior which I
feel like if you're gonna go white on
the outside you just go white on the
inside too and I know that sounds a bit
racy but it's totally not I swear so
okay I'm cool with the case why don't we
go ahead and take a closer look at the
side here and also examine some of his
internal hardware we've got an andy FX
8320 very it's an older chip but still
can can crank out some some decent
performance CPU cooler as a beat quiet
dark rock Pro 3 now this thing is
massive I can't even see what his his
dims look like his RAM configuration
because this thing is just huge but I've
read so many good reviews on it it's
just unanimously awesome across the
board so good choice on that it also
matches your black and white thing quite
well instead of getting like a chromatic
heatsink for example I think that was a
smart choice on your part an excellent
performance all-around motherboard is an
MSI and 3 plus SLI crate Edition a nice
little budget board there 12 gigabytes
of EVGA 1866 ram again I can't really
see it but I'll take your word for it
and we've got two video cards in here
guys they're both GTX 950 s
but they are of different manufacturer
varieties we've got a PNY that's the one
on the bottom and then an EVGA GTX 950
on top so that leads me to believe that
you probably had one of them first you
probably had the EVGA one first for
example and then you kind of stumbled
across the the second one there and just
happened to be like maybe you've got a
really good deal on it you weren't
really expecting to go SLI in this bitch
but just happen that way and that's why
they don't match and more on that later
you've got a 120 gig SSD SanDisk 240 gig
crucial I wrote 240 gig twice on the
crucial that does not mean it's 480 gigs
that is strictly a typo hard drive you
got a WD blue one tear
but you got some WD in there how
are their hard drives and of course
there are M 650 watt power supply ok so
take a look at this picture Andrew here
my thoughts here the pros ok I'm diggin
the black and white I think that's a
solid classic choice you can't really go
wrong with black and white these days
however there are a couple things no I'm
not gonna talk about the cons yet we're
just doing pros black and white solid
for the most part you've done a bang-up
job of color coordinating things like I
said the black on your CPU cooler as
well as the sleeved extensions are
really nice the cable management here is
pretty clean for the most part I like
how you took the 2 PCIe cables and kind
of strung them together you kind of like
you know mesh them together tied them
down with a zip ties and whatnot I think
that's a really good choice it looks
really clean used black SATA cables for
your data I think that's also a wise
choice altogether it looks like you
clean this either regularly or you built
it recently because it looks pretty
spotless from from this angle anyway but
there's there's a couple things that I
did want to point out that I was like
huh I don't know I don't know about that
the first of which being this fan cable
that is braided so that's nice but it's
kind of just dangling on top of your top
video card there and I feel like you
just kind of ran it across your system
it was like you kind of like did a
kool-aid man where you're just like I
have a cable and it's just gonna plow
through my entire system I don't care
how it gets there but it's gonna just
plow through everything until it reaches
the the header that I want to plug it
into that's kind of what you did here oh
yeah but I think it would have been
better had you gotten like some kind of
extension for that for that cable and
maybe routed it behind your motherboard
tray and then up through your CPU
grommet and then down between your rear
exhaust fan and that CPU cooler to
discreetly plug into that header I don't
know just a thought because this is
probably the sloppiest part of your
system here the other thing I don't know
if you can tell really really really
well here maybe this is a better picture
yes you can see that sli bridge that I
briefly alluded to earlier it's yes
don't do it I don't like it it's it's
copper ish color I mean I know you have
to have it but I mean they come in black
man they come in but just get a black
one
cuz that is no bueno I'm sorry that is
just not I don't like you here Lera move
the specs really quick so you can see oh
oh no I mean honestly it's has it's just
an aesthetic thing Oh God goodness the
thing is your view we're going so strong
in the black and white theme but that
that crossed though the sorry the SLI
bridge kind of kills it as well as that
power supply sticker for that matter
very easy to peel those things off get a
heat gun or even just you know do it the
wrong way and just use your fingers and
stand there for an hour to peel it off
but I think changing those two things
would have really helped your overall
black and white theme here and I think
that might dock you some points with the
audience again points don't matter I can
only just say what I want to say but all
together all together man a solid solid
build and that's why you are contestant
number one of this here episode so why
don't we go ahead and move on to Akash
and sorry if I'm butchering your name
Akash Akash but I apologize I'm not that
culturally diverse but hey you've got a
really cool system here it's a Corsair
200 R which is a very great budget case
mind you but still has kind of like it's
a it's like a it's like a super budget
case where it can still do well in the
realm of like a mid-range system and by
the way I probably forgot to mention
this at the very beginning of this
episode guys but this is a mid-range
season so all the all the contestants
all the rigs you're gonna be seeing for
the month for this month are basically
mid-range and I didn't really categorize
builds based on price because prices are
not very stable they fluctuate
constantly so it was more just kind of
an overall judgment that I had to make
on a per per case basis or a persistent
basis if you will so keep that in mind
I'm not gonna have budget systems
competing against high-end water-cooled
builds so for the month of February
these are all mid-range let's go back
and check out the rest of the cash is
built here so of course there are 200
are let's take a look at the side
profile alright so what do we got going
on here we've got an Intel Core i5 6500
which is a non cased you you've got a
cooler master now I didn't know you
didn't mention which which cooler this
was it's not a 212 Evo be
because I can just tell from the shape
of the the the heatsink there but it is
something equivalent it's kind of in
that same that same tier of cooler
probably similar price range and things
like that you've also got a gigabyte h1
70 gaining three no I like your your
choice of motherboard and CPU here
because you you definitely had it in
mind to cut down on costs by not going
with a case q chip from Intel and you
knew you knew ahead of time that that
meant you didn't really need like a z170
motherboard or a board that supported
overclocking so you went with H 170 to
save a bit more change I think that's a
really nice pair up so you definitely
get some points for me for that you've
got one eight gig stick of G scale 2133
I honestly would have liked to see some
dual channel memory in there especially
I mean mainly for performance to take
advantage of that that that ability but
also for aesthetics in a way - it kind
of looks a little lonely there with just
one dim sticking out it looks like he
lost his friend you know and adds
nothing I hate more than a lonely dim
it's just the world just looks a little
dim when I'm sorry I'm sorry
moving on you've got an asus strix gtx
960 4 gig version ok awesome card I love
the Strix coolers they're very effective
super quiet you've also got a Seagate
one terabyte hard drive no SSD in this
case unless you just forgot to mention
it but it doesn't look like you have an
SSD in here either there's probably no
room there's definitely no room behind
the motherboard tray for an SSD at least
natively unless you did some velcro ee
stuff but it looks like you only have
those two hard drives and there's only
two SATA cables coming out of your SATA
ports on your motherboard so no SSD here
but that's ok and of course err CX 430
so you kind of did a mishmash here a
mash-up of really budget parts combined
with more mid-range parts and I think I
I really like the way you did it because
you knew where to cut corners in a
system you knew that you could save a
lot of money on a power supply and a
case for example to spend a little bit
more money on a CPU and a graphics card
and I think that really shows here with
your system and we've got a few more
pictures here you got a money shot there
as far as like you know your color
scheme you don't really have one I mean
I guess it's kind of like black and red
but the power supply just kind of
because you're stuck with those hideous
ketchup and mustard cables that we that
we always love to point out in on
awesome hardware so there's not much you
can do about that honestly it'd be
pointless to get like sleeve extensions
for this thing just because I mean what
are you gonna do there's there's hardly
any room behind the motherboard tray
just gonna have more cable clutter in
the end so maybe in the future getting a
better power supply cuz that's really
not doing you any favors in the looks
department honestly
here's another side profile okay yeah I
mean altogether a pretty solid build but
you know that there are certain things
that do need to be worked on as far as
the aesthetics again the power supply
and the white SATA data cables aren't
killing me I mean they're killing me a
little bit they're not killing me a lot
but I feel like they would blend in a
lot better with black if you just had
straight black cables cuz you don't
really have too many white components
here in this system so I think that
would have been a wise choice but
altogether thank you a cash for year
submission why don't we go ahead and
move on to PC number three here we go
alright this is Mason Mason is in an in
win 703 now I don't have much experience
at all with this case I have seen it in
person it does look fairly decent
I haven't read too many reviews on
either but it does have a black and red
color scheme this particular model so
let's go ahead and see what you did with
the inside if that kind of corresponds
and yes it does for the most part you've
got a an AMD FX excuse me Oh AMD FX 6350
well that was stuck at CPU cooler is a
corsair h 75 you've got an msi 970
gaming motherboard 16 gigs of hyper x
ram you didn't really specify the speed
but we do see that there are four sticks
in there so you got four by four which
is nice GPU is an msi r9 380 and a data
SP 120 gig SSD WD blue one terabytes
hard drive in a roswell arc 650 watt
power supply so r9 380 excellent choice
for a mid-range system I think the 6350
is also a great choice for a mid-range
computer you can definitely get some
nice overclocks with that especially
with the cooler that you have on there
so I think wise choice in hardware
selection overall and it looks like you
have plenty of room in this case for all
of your components it doesn't look like
you have like too much room and it
doesn't look too tight either so well
balanced in terms of spatial awareness
there the power supply seems to be the
weak link in a lot of these builds so
far because you've got Rosewill which
okay though they're kind of hit and miss
in my opinion in terms of hardware and
stuff when it comes to reliability it is
80 plus certified this arc power supply
here and while it while it does seem
reliable it is also of the ketchup and
mustard variety when it comes to cables
and I think that that should just not
exist anymore manufacturers need to stop
doing that and people should stop buying
power supplies with that with those
cables if they send a message to
manufacturers everywhere no I'm getting
too into crazy like in over my head
right now
but yeah that's the that's the thing
that kind of kills it for me also that
fan on the bottom the fan on the bottom
is almost as hideous as the sticker on
your power supply and it's really not
the fan honestly the fan just looks bad
because it's got that horrible cable
wrapped around it it's that yellow cable
ooh that's just repulsive but that being
said your cable management altogether is
pretty good for for the case that you
have honestly you don't have like the
best cable routing options in the the
the 703 but I think you did a pretty
fair job and there's another money shot
here we can get a closer look you know
even though your cables aren't pretty
like your 24 pin and even this god-awful
clear wire that's for your fan looks
like a fan header right there even
though those are pretty awful it still
looks like you executed the the cable
routing quite well so points for you on
that to my brother but of course I think
there could be some much-needed
improvement for aesthetics the things I
already mentioned here's a nice LED shot
of of your system powered on and you
went with red of course of course I'm
glad you went with red but what I like
about this too is that you kind of have
three different light sources you have
multiple light sources you it looks like
you've got an RGB LED strip
no not RGB sorry a red LED strip at the
top of your case I can kind of see some
LEDs peeking out there as well as an LED
fan at the front and that ugly one at
the bottom which looks much better when
it's lit up like that and I think this
kind of provides a nice even glow for
all your components as opposed to just
one LED strip on one side of your case
you know giving some really harsh
lighting on one hat like one side of
your components but leaving the rest of
it in the dark I think this is a really
nice well lit and evenly lit system with
the LEDs on so good on you good on you
mate for that and then we've got this
other picture this is this I found
interesting because I let you guys send
me two optional photos of your choice
and you decided to send me a picture of
the back of your case which you're the
only submission you're the only guy I
got who was like you know what I'm
sending him my rear you know maybe
you're just into rears I don't know I'm
not gonna judge but you know maybe you
wanted to show off the three badass
antennas that you got there on your
tp-link Wi-Fi adapter right maybe that
is what's gonna win this competition for
you but all together pretty clean I like
it there's not much else I can say
you've installed everything correctly
from this picture so thank you very much
Mayson for that let's go ahead and move
on to number four candidate number four
we are getting close to deny to the end
close to the end folks with Luke I am
your father
and this rig is your baby I am sure cuz
it's a it's pretty sexy Luke it's pretty
sexy I like what you've done here in the
NZXT h 440 white edition again one of
those great white cases that has a white
painted interior very popular as well
let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the inside here Luke you've got a Core
i5 4690k
okay NZXT Kraken X 61 that's an AO and
yeah it looks like you've got your two
fans in the push configuration right
there exhausting some holiday off the
top there good and then your motherboard
is an MSI z97 s SLI crate excellent 16
gigs of teen group elite memory looks
like you've got two dims in there you
didn't specify but it looks like you've
got two dims so eight gigs a piece very
nice and then you've got an ATI Radeon
r9 265 now this was kind of interesting
because you have a
pretty a pretty powerful core i5 chip in
there that is unlocked and you've
probably overclocked it based on the
cooler that you have there as well but
you've got this very entry-level kind of
budget card and if your CPU with
anything less if you were like on a you
know a 6300 or something I would have
put you into the budget category
instantly but because you had this like
kind of mishmash of hardware I just
threw you in here with the with the
mid-range
especially like given the case and other
factors you know put me made me to
believe that you should be in the
mid-range category so I'm guessing that
you're probably not using this for for
much hardcore gaming because you
probably can't with that kind of card so
essentially you're either just browsing
the web and watching blu-rays or not
blu-rays but you're watching doing a lot
of media streaming and playback where
you don't really need to tax the video
card all too much or that's a temporary
solution and you're you know you're just
sitting on some some dough to save up
for a better card but you know as long
as you're not doing any hardcore gaming
if you're trying to do hardcore gaming
with this then I'd say it's a bad setup
but you know honestly I don't think
that's the case I think you're just your
gaming needs aren't really typical for
the average PC gamer so I think that's
fine I'm not gonna dock you any points
there that's just something that I
wanted to mention the other thing is
you've got another again a beautiful
black and white color theme here cable
management looks pretty on point we can
go ahead oh but but but there's a little
bit of the PCIe cable that's kind of
hanging down going into that bottom cut
out of the h4 40 I would have liked to
see it just a little bit tighter had you
put like a zip tie around it to instead
of just kind of let it water fall down
into the the the routing hole there I
think that would look a lot cleaner cuz
it just looks a little bit looks a
little bit messy quite honestly but um
altogether I like your I like your SSD
right there looks very nice let's go
ahead and take a look at your money shot
here get a closer look at your video
cards definitely a budget card but you
know what
everything's pretty clean I like how all
your fans are also matching your rear
exhaust fan your your to radiator fans
are also very matchy-matchy kind of just
gives a really cohesive look to to the
rig as a whole and then we've got
another shot
with your side panel on okay and now we
can also see that you've got some white
LEDs I believe I did see a strip that's
kind of on the right side if we take a
look again one more time here wait sorry
you can kind of see that there's an LED
strip right on the the hard drive cage
wall you can barely see it there but
when it's lit up you can kind of see the
LEDs like the the glare of the LEDs
through the window and I think I think
you intentionally took the picture at
this angle so that we would have a
harder time seeing the LEDs inside your
case and I think in order for LEDs to
really be pulled off well into a case
they shouldn't be visible from the side
panel window from where you're standing
at any point unless you like at a super
extreme angle they shouldn't be that
visible and I think there's kind of a
little bit too much LED reflection here
there's there's too much LEDs showing in
this particular case and and you can
even see it amplified here again this is
also what I was talking about where I
believe it was either Mason or a cash
one of them had really nice it was just
Mason I think had really nice even
lighting around his case and this is
kind of what I was talking about where a
lot of times you just have one LED strip
in one region of your chassis and it
kind of just it casts a lot of harsh
shadows on your components which doesn't
look all that great it looks much nicer
with it with a lot of even lighting so I
might have duck you some points on that
but the the the effort is definitely
receiving an A in this category so thank
you very much Luke for your age for 40
built here and finally we are moving on
to Errol Errol I hope I'm pronouncing
your name right as well Errol's got a
very nice system here with an NZXT
phantom 410 this is actually the red I'm
sorry the red I'm currently colorblind
at the moment in other news this is the
white and blue version which I'm not a
huge fan of but when you take a look at
the side here you can kind of see that
he's done a fair job of matching
components fairly well here everything
from the the PCIe are the expansion
slots which I believe you've
spray-painted blue which is actually a
very accurate blue to the the
that you find in the chassis so I think
that's a smart choice that was well done
on you and also the the RAM there so
let's just take a look at the specs
we've got an Intel Core i5 6500 hyper
212 Evo a-coz 170 K now I have an issue
here because you've got a z170 board but
a non case Q on your CPU so I don't know
you you what what was the point I guess
other than maybe aesthetics or other
features that you might get with a z170
chipset I mean one of the main features
the the main feature of z170 is
overclock abilities so without being
able to do that on your current chip I
feel like that's a bit of a wasted a
wasted decision or a wasted component
there so that's that that would
definitely dock you some points on on my
end and you've also got the g.skill
ripjaws 5 it didn't specify how many
gigs or the capacity of each of those
dims I would guess either 8 or 16 and
MSI r9 380 very nice little budget card
there as well as the Samsung 850 Evo
didn't specify the capacity and a
Seagate one terabyte hard drive and a
corsair CX 600 M now Errol Errol Errol
it looks like you went to great lengths
at kind of tailoring this build to meet
a certain look to pull off a certain
aesthetic and I feel like if you really
wanted to drive at home drive the theme
home you could probably afford to get
either sleeved black sleeved extensions
or blue sleeved extensions with the same
shade of blue that you have already
going on and ripping off that power
supply sticker immediately or getting a
new power supply altogether maybe saving
that CX model as a backup for example in
case you need it for a rainy day or for
another system down the line but that
ketchup and mustard is just staring at
me it's like it's like right in the
middle of your system - it's like the
butthole of your rig and usually the
butt hole folks is the ugliest part of a
person's butt so yeah there's that you
also have a money shot here money shot
is kind of dark this is probably as dark
as I will accept for my my PC
submissions on booted but
I did I did the blush so okay I can't
really see too much here but it looks
like everything's routed pretty nicely
for the most part so altogether there
are a couple things missing that I would
like to see here Errol but a valiant
effort all around and holy smokes guys I
think that's all five the first five
contestants of this here series so wow
that that won by I don't know that go by
quickly or slowly that will greatly
determine whether or not this is good or
this is a good show so at this point
we're gonna quickly recap each of the
systems I'm just gonna quickly like for
5-10 seconds recap each of the builds so
it's fresh in your mind who we're all
voting for and then of course we're
gonna put it to a vote so let's go ahead
and take a look at PC number one pretty
soon number one was Andrew okay
there's PC number one now we've got PC
number two a cash and his Corsair two
hundred are with the 6500 and his Strix
gtx 960 full gigabyte they've got mason
number three this is number three now
remember the numbers that correspond to
each of these pcs guys cuz that's how
you will be voting on them as by their
number so you got mason at number three
you've got Luke at number four this is
PC number four and then finally we just
took a look at Ariel's PC number five
all right guys so right about now you
should be seeing a link pop up in chat
that my beautiful wife Heather who's in
the other room currently watching the
stream should be pasting into chat
furiously right now if she's paying
attention honey I hope you are and at
that point you guys should click that
link and vote on which of these pcs you
think it deserves to go on to the final
round in week four remember these are
the five pcs that you're voting on I've
got some thumbnails right here so you
can get a side profile of the five that
we talked about with their corresponding
numbers so again if you thought you know
this PC was the best you're gonna vote
for number three and so forth now don't
don't vote in chat you're going to
- wait you're gonna have to wait for the
link to come out and I'm replying to
people who are you know cuz the stream
difference the time difference whatever
so while you guys are voting I'm gonna
give you guys a little bit of time to
think about it now remember that all the
things that I told you about think about
the hardware layout the specifications
did the did the components make sense
not just which one had the the highest
performing components it's really not
about that guys it's really about the
computer as a whole so judge it as a
whole be smart about it you guys have
probably built a PC or two in your time
maybe some of you sure some of you have
built more than I have so think about
all facets of the PC build before you
just go ahead and vote on whichever one
you think is the prettiest or the most
expensive but in the meantime while you
guys are thinking very carefully and
analytically about your votes we're
gonna go ahead and take one more look at
our sponsor for today which is again
fantex go ahead and check them out at
fantex dot-com dan text dat can gas and
check out all the cool stuff that
they've got going on her her alright so
they're empty and through pro em as a
budget case very very nice if you're
trying to get into the enthu line of
chassis x' and one kind of that
feature-rich experience but don't really
have the budget to fork out so it's kind
of a kind of a nice entry-level way of
getting into that that that line of
chassis but also the the fantex crew was
telling me just earlier today that they
are pretty much launching a RGB LED
strip and sorry for what's going on
right here they're launching an RGB LED
strip that's gonna be compatible with
the asus rog formula 8 or I'm sorry the
Maximus 8 formula which as many of you
guys know will have like a built in
header on the bottom of the motherboard
for you to connect an RGB LED strip and
then you can therefore then control that
strip or those strips in the ORA
software so fantex just alerted me today
that they're gonna be coming out with
one of those now they didn't really have
any documents to give me in time for the
show that i could show you so i don't
have any actual pictures of the strip or
what its gonna look like but so i took
it upon myself to create my own ad for
the RGB LED strip from fantex so here's
my add new
I have a bunch of experience in
advertising and marketing I worked at
Newegg for a few years in their video
department so I know about how to make a
strong and and selling ad that really
speaks to the audience so this is what I
have it's a new RGB LED strips from
fantex supported by asus rog maximus I
actually put seven but it's it's eight
that's all part of the marketing thing
you know throw people off make them
think no man that's really supposed to
say eight you know that's good marketing
the Maximus eight formula and Ora
software and here you can see the board
sporting his brand new RGB LED strip
from fantex and you can see the RGB
color the colors are just shooting out
because it's just that it's just that
powerful and magical so that is my ad
that that fantasy actually paid for so
thank you fantex again so much for
sponsoring this go ahead and follow him
on Twitter I know they're not super
active on Twitter these days but maybe
if you give them some love at fantex
they might start updating more
frequently or something like that so
thank you so much fantex
now now then what am i doing where we
going here I think that's enough time
for you guys to put in to input your
votes so on that note why don't we go
ahead and take a look at who our first
finalist is and some of you probably
already know because you just look at
the results cuz you're all cheaters
that's no fun guys it's no fun you
should vote and just close your eyes and
wait for me to reveal who the winner is
I shouldn't say a winner cuz you're not
the winner this episode you're the
finalist here you're a finalist
you're just one cog and a bunch of a
bunch of wheels alright anyway let's go
ahead and take a look at our freakin
straw poll cuz I am I'm actually curious
I already have my vote I already kind of
know who I would vote for but you never
know you never know I could be wrong I
hope I am wrong I hope you guys have a
mind of your own and I hope we're
different people I don't know what I'm
talking about
so which PC ladies and gentleman should
go on to the final round in week four
let's go ahead and take a look at the
results now whoever is at the top of the
straw poll as soon as I click results
will be the winner you guys ready
drumroll
and the finalists from week one yes PC
number four Wow okay
PC number four by quite a landslide
actually 55 votes 52 percent of you over
half of you guys voted for PC number
four that's okay interesting I might
have seen that coming
because PC number four was a very
formidable system quite robust I think
he executed a lot of things very well
here
cable management for won a very strong
theme with nothing standing out right
things like ketchup and mustard kale was
I think that probably docked a lot of
people a lot of points in certain
aspects but also you just had a very
strong build all together and I like the
fact that you guys voted for Luke's
build even though he had an R 9 to 65 in
there because the last thing I wanted
was for people to vote based on how
awesome the video card or CPU was or a
combination of both so thank you guys
for voting honestly and openly and
smartly for this this first episode I
hope that kind of philosophy continues
throughout the series and Luke
congratulations I don't know I'm still
showing this stupid thing
congratulations Luke you are our first
finalist for the series for season one
of booted and we will be seeing you
again in week four where we take a look
at the other two finalists that will be
chosen in the two in the next two
following weeks but that is pretty much
gonna conclude it for this first episode
