enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory over cloth
get yours today at the awesomesauce
store wuzzle guys so if you happen to
catch my recent gtx 980ti 2-way SLI
video you probably also heard my big
announcement that i'm currently planning
my first ever custom water-cooled build
which will also feature the same beastly
duel card setup now having a powerful
graphic solution is key to building an
epic gaming PC sure but as we all know
all components of a computer should be
more or less on par with each other in
terms of quality and performance in
order to achieve a cohesive and well
balanced rig perhaps that's explanation
enough as to why I have this wickedly
built and feature packed motherboard
sitting pretty in my office say hello to
the AC saber-tooth x99 and give him a
warm welcome to the awesomesauce family
because I've officially selected it to
go inside of my custom water-cooled PC
not only are you going to get to see
this board in action but today I'll be
conducting a proper full review of it as
well so you can learn or be reminded of
what makes this board special while much
of its charm is obscured within the
details of its specs and server grade
componentry the rest of what sets this
board apart can be seen at a glance aces
tough branded thermal armor is nothing
new to there sabertooth line but I'm
glad to see the aggressive military
cover plate make its return to their x99
board the two-tone plastic shroud in
black and gunmetal gray looks
combat-ready with its bold edges and
diamond plate pattern surely this kind
of design is a lover hate affair but
based on the circumstances you can
probably guess which way I swing stop
not only does this give the board a
truly unique aesthetic it offers
thoughtful dust protection while
creating a channel for airflow with the
included but optional 40 millimeter
assistent fan this implementation
funnels fresh air to the pipe connected
heat sinks of your 10 phase digi+ vrm
creating a direct method of heat
dissipation not found on most boards the
fan can also spin in Reverse to eject
dust upwards via the special dusty fan
feature in thermal radar to which we'll
touch on later if you need full access
to the board's PCB for cleaning and
maintenance the thermal armor is easily
removable using the nine screws on the
back this is
you will also find the tough fortifier a
rigid metal backplate that keeps the PCB
from bowing and potential trace damage
went up holding heavy graphics cards or
CPU coolers a much-needed support system
for my two gtx 980ti s like the thermal
armor asus has engineered the fortifier
with versatility in mind doubling its
use as a cooling mechanism via an
underlying layer of thermal padding
effectively reducing the board's
temperature by up to 6 degrees celsius
with the board exposed here's a quick
look at the integrated audio chip with
dedicated amplifier and trace separation
to help reduce electromagnetic
interference up front and center we get
our 2011 - 3 socket for Intel's latest
haswell-e CPUs tightly sandwiched
between 8 dimm slots with support for up
to 64 gigabytes of ddr4 at 2400
megahertz
the slots are painted alternately in
black and dark beige a neutral color
scheme that's also been implemented
across the boards many connectors apart
from an X 4 and an X 1 PCIe slot you get
3 x16 slots for 3-way crossfire or SLI
configurations the 210 slots being PCIe
gen3 and the bottom slot running at Gen
2 if you're using a 40 PCIe Lane CPU
like the 59 30 K or the 59 60 X single
and dual card setups will run at x16
across the board
whereas triple card configs have the
bottom card running at x8 a 28 linked
CPU I'm talking about you 5820k will run
a single card at x16 2 cards at x16 and
x8 and three cards at x16 8 and for
removing the small cover plate between
the bottom 2 PCIe slots reveals access
to your CMOS battery and to stealthy m2m
key slot for SSDs of varying lengths
well I like the clever orientation here
m2 support is limited to PCIe drives
only meaning the slower but cheaper SATA
m2 drives are in this case unusable with
less expensive board supporting both
protocols this is an unfortunate
limitation but ASA scores big points
back for having full SFF 86 39 support
when paired with a hyper kit meaning
you'll be able to utilize the full speed
of PCI 3.0 x4 drives like Intel's
wickedly fast 750 series nvme SSD the
storage frenzy continues with SATA
Express and 10 SATA 6 ports eight of
which are natively controlled by the X
and
ix chipset other notable i/o on the
board includes two USB 2 and one USB 3
port mm okay button which bypasses
memory issues that keep your system from
booting three temperature leads to
connect the included temp nodes for
tracking your systems thermals and 11
for pin pwm fan headers hopefully my new
computer doesn't fly away
managing 11 system fans is no easy task
which is why asus has brought a ton of
functionality to tune and monitor your
system parameters in thermal radar to
the control room if you will found in AI
suite 3 in addition to providing the
temperatures of 10 built-in sensors and
the three nodes that you place manually
you can also set custom fan curves for
each fan based on the thermal status of
those sensors for a more automated
approach we're all used to seeing the
pre-configured silent standard and
performance modes in similar
applications but Thermal radar too goes
a step further by giving you the ability
to run a one-time test on your fans to
figure out each of their unique
parameters like spin up voltage and max
rpm the software then uses that
information to individually program the
fans various profiles for finer grain
tunability a super handy feature that
optimizes your case cooling with minimal
effort though I've only just scratched
the surface of this extensive software
it might actually be best for me to show
it in action when the water cooled build
is finally finished so let me know in
the comments if you'd like to see a
dedicated video on AI suite 3 and
thermal radar - getting back to the
hardware asus has decked this board out
with a feature-rich IO for starters you
get 5 USB 2 ports one of which is
reserved for the tough detective feature
a technology that lets you monitor and
control your system using a connected
android mobile device through the
downloadable app you can check details
on your current post codes
monitor temps voltages and fan speeds or
perform basic functions like power your
system on and off or clear the CMOS
while this ability does seem like it
could prove useful having the Android
device tethered to the PC certainly
limits the number of scenarios where it
might be handy moving on you get two USB
3.1 type-a ports that yield speeds up to
10 gigabits per second or twice the
throughput of USB 3 as an added bonus
these along with 4 USB 3 ports support
USB 3.1 boost which speeds up the
transfer rates of connected ua SP
devices plus all of the USB ports on the
back support
Ã¡i charger plus allowing you to charge
your portable B C 1.1 mobile devices
three times faster than a standard USB
port the bottom right USB 3 port also
supports BIOS flashback with the
dedicated button rounding off the i/o
are your Intel and real tech Gigabit
Ethernet LAN ports optical s/pdif out
and your 3.5 millimeter audio jacks with
the board you also get some nifty
accessories like these little dust
defenders which plug up just about every
unused port on your motherboard the
three temperature nodes a Q connector
for easy installation of your front
panel connectors six SATA cables half of
them straight to the other half right
angle a ribbon style sli bridge IO
shield stickers documentation and driver
CD and a certificate of reliability
recognising that the board has passed a
handful of server grade tests which make
it live up to the tough moniker by
putting it in the ranks of an enterprise
level product this along with a
five-year warranty from Asus
demonstrates their utmost vote of
confidence
I also took a tour of the board's latest
UEFI which by default boots you into
easy mode where you get a comprehensive
look at basic system stats and some
useful options for setting XMP profiles
enabling Intel rst boot priority and
even a custom fan curve for any
connected fans in advanced mode I had no
problems finding certain settings as
everything is clearly labeled and well
organized one big gripe I have is the
clunky sideswipe transition when going
from tab to tab waiting for the
transition to finish before the selected
tab is highlighted slows down the
navigation process and can get annoying
rather quickly on the bright side I was
impressed by the clear descriptions for
each of the settings in AI Tweaker which
should make the overclocking experience
for novice users less intimidating in
case you were wondering I did take the
time to do some overclocking on this
board and was quickly able to get my 59
60 X up to 4.5 gigahertz at 1.3 volts
that's a full 100 megahertz faster than
I've ever been able to do on my x99
gaming g1 Wi-Fi so where does all of
this leave my conclusion of the
sabre-tooth x99 well the tough grid
componentry and attention to detail make
this board feel like a quality product
that exhibits toughness in the
traditional sense not only can it
withstand a high-end system teaming with
some of today's bleeding edge hardware
but it comes packaged with easily the
most customizable and intuitive tuning
software I've seen the
features in thermal radar - were so
useful I almost wish I had a third
monitor just to have it up 24/7 in this
way Asus has not only delivered a
finished product they delivered an
experience during my time at the board I
found myself tuning a system in ways I
hadn't before granting me a higher level
of tunability that other enthusiasts are
sure to geek out on for days this along
with more features than you can count
make this x99 board a great bang for the
buck option at just north of $300 well
it does have some inherent flaws the
pros definitely outweigh the cons here
and I'm even more thrilled having done
this review to start using it in my
first custom loop system but let me know
you guys think of this board in the
comments below and feel free to toss me
