channel so I've got some different plan
for today
not your typical and boxing or review
but rather instead I'm going to be
testing out a product that I already own
which is my GTX 970 it's an EVGA for the
win edition so it's factory overclocked
it's running its stock right now I
didn't push it any further for the
purpose of this video what I'm gonna be
doing with it today is I'm going to be
running GTA 4 at 4k and I'm going to see
how much we can get away with in terms
of eye candy and different filters and
things like that and what kind of
sacrifices you might have to make if
you're going to try to play this game
with a 970 at 4k so this is actually
running at 4k right now I'm getting
about there's an FPS counter in the top
left corner of the screen it's really
tiny it's the steam overlay one and if
you can see I might try to enlarge it
and post-production if I can but I'm
going about anywhere from the low 60s to
the hub to the mid 70s it's it's a
little lower than average right now I'd
say because there's a lot of foliage
like I'm in the mountains and grass is
really taxing on your hardware in this
game performance really takes a hit when
you're running through a lot of greenery
but so bear that in mind but basically I
want to start off also by saying that
since this is a GTX 970 that we're
working with we only do have three and a
half gigs of gddr5 memory not the
advertised for and there's that whole
debacle that I'm not going to get into
right now I'm just strictly talking
about the specs as they stand so we need
to be mindful when tuning the settings
in this game to not exceed that 3.5 gig
limit I'm going to the settings here and
under graphics you'll find the majority
of your settings and you'll see right
here I'm running a 4k I've got vsync
turned off and I've got pretty much
everything on minimum settings this is
like the lowest lowest of the lows right
here actually I take that back we can
actually crank these up all the way
because they have no effect on
performance whatsoever uh but as far as
all these other settings here and you
know how much of a difference do they
really make well I was kind of exploring
experimenting and with trial and error
today and I kind of drew some
conclusions that I wanted to share with
you guys the first thing I want to show
you guys it's easier to just show you
than it is to explain it but I'm gonna
run through drive through the mountains
here and visually the game still looks
great even with everything turned down I
mean everything's super sharp and it
looks it still looks way better than
then the original on ps4 or Xbox one but
you might notice especially when I'm
running past the trees if you look at
the trees that are in the distance and
as I approach them and the hillside as
well this the shadows kind of just pop
up out of nowhere when I get close
enough to them which can be kind of
distracting and that's the that's the
shadow the shadow draw distance
basically or the distance at which the
game engine begins to render shadows and
right now I have that like I said
everything's turned way down and like
you know the lower quality textures I
can deal with and even the like the
shadows that are like the shadow of my
car even though it's not like super
sharp it's a little blurry I can deal
with that because it's consistent and
it's not constantly changing in front of
me so I don't really notice it it kind
of just blends into the the rest of the
environment but as far as like the
shadows on the trees and all the other
objects as I'm approaching them that's
what really throws me off and pulls me
out of the game personally so what I
want to do is address that problem by
going into my settings and this is just
speaking of personal preference I mean
you guys can emulate this if you want on
your own systems but if you don't like
it obviously you don't have to this is
just kind of me sharing my my thoughts
and my experience on this game so what I
what I did is actually with shadow
quality you'll notice that if you go to
advanced graphics that the extended
shadows distance option is completely
grayed out that's because you can only
access that setting if you have your
shadow quality turned to very high so
I'm going to turn to very high
and then you'll notice that I can now
adjust the extended shadows distance
setting so I'm going to crank that up
all the way as well as as well as
distance scaling extended distance
scaling and crank that up as well now
it's saying it's going to increase our
video RAM usage so I'm going to be
mindful
I have gpu-z opened up on another window
so I have to keep a lookout on that
window to make sure that we're not
maxing out our video Ram because then
we're gonna start getting artifacts and
it's gonna be bad so I'm also going to
go to graphics here and just turn up the
regular distance scaling I don't know if
you noticed but when I was driving
through those mountains there would be
some bushes that wouldn't appear until I
was like 30 feet away or even some road
signs that wouldn't appear until I got
really close to them and that's what
really brings me out of the game it's
not so much the lower quality textures
of the environment as a whole it's when
things are appearing out of nowhere
magically in front of me that that
really kills the kills the vibe or kills
kills the realism of the game so now
you'll notice as I'm driving through
here frame rates have taken a bit of a
hit we're at 50 low 50s now so that's
that's to be expected then you'll notice
I can't really drive right now yeah
frame rates pretty choppy right now but
then you'll also notice that when I pass
through the trees the the game engine is
actually rendering the shadows a lot
further out the draw distance for the
shin both the shadows and the objects
themselves are a lot further out so
they're being rendered a lot earlier and
I'm not noticing them appear magically
right in front of me as soon as you know
when I get 10 feet away from them and
this really helps bring me back into the
game where I can kind of just focus on
what's ahead of me and because you know
our eyes are very focused on movement we
can catch the smallest thing moving like
the smallest net or fly in the distance
moving because our eyes are naturally
really good at picking up motion so when
those shadows and those objects are
appearing out of nowhere fairly close to
me it's distracting so
and also speaking of which we are just
under our three and a half gig memory
limit we're at three point we just hit
three point five actually we we passed
it we're at three thousand five hundred
and four megabytes so we're actually
four megabytes over what we should be
over our threshold here but hopefully we
won't see any artifacting so far
everything looks pretty crystal clear on
my end honestly I think forty four the
the mid 40 frames per second range is
too low for most of us in fact it's too
low for me and I wouldn't I wouldn't
consider it enjoyable gameplay its
playable but it's not enjoyable for me I
want some buttery smooth at least you
know in the mid 60s average before I can
be like alright I'm completely immersed
now so what I'm gonna go what I'm gonna
do is go back to jump back into the
settings here into graphics we're going
to try to find a way to up our frame
rate again so in the Advanced Settings
I'm going to reduce this just a little
bit msaa if you're rocking this a 4k on
a single card even if it's a 980
probably turn it off I mean it does help
a lot it really smooths up the edges on
pretty much everything at just at x2 but
there's an even bigger impact on
performance there I mean I was seeing at
least 15 to 20 frames being dropped
going from off to 2x which is just it's
just too much it's too big of a
sacrifice for me fxaa is you know
obviously not as taxing on the GPU but
it doesn't look quite as nice as MSAA
either instead of sampling the instances
of a jagged line or an edge it kind of
just blurs it it kind of creates the
illusion that it's smooth but it kind of
gives this blurred effect and I don't
really like the way it looks personally
these three I found no difference in
performance so I kind of just left it
preference if you like lots of people go
ahead and crank it up all the way it
doesn't really matter as far as texture
quality doesn't affect frame rates as
much as it does video RAM and since
we're limited on that
at this point I'm definitely keeping
that to normal theater quality I mean
kind of the inverse of texture didn't
affect my video round as much but
affected my frame rates by like four to
six frames per second so keeping that on
normal as well but back to the issue at
hand I went on a huge tangent there I
kind of just rambling here we're just
hanging out
hangouts casual there's no script here
can go off the handle that's cool I need
to find a way to raise the frame rates
back up all right guys I just stumbled
upon a discovery just now that I wasn't
expecting obviously I went to the
settings and I had a hunch that the soft
shadow setting was doing something
finicky because it was working I was
getting much higher frame rates earlier
than what you just saw when I had the
soft shadows changed to soft and then I
was doing some reach research online a
lot of people were saying I was switch
to you know the the manufacturer of your
of your graphics card which I also said
earlier and I switched it back to soft
just like that and my frame rates
instantly went back up to the mid 70s
or the low 70s I guess which is still I
don't know like 10 frames per second
better or more than than what I was just
getting you can see I'm at like 79 80
right now so apparently that is a huge a
huge consideration for for hardware
impact performance impact and and the
shadows we don't really look that much
different to me honestly um I am going
to do more research on that but that's
I'm really glad that I stumbled across
that because now we're getting beautiful
like in the mid to low 70s range you
know and now now instead of dipping into
the 50s and even the 40s which was
virtually unplayable for me anyway
now we're dipping into the 60s instead
and that's much more tolerable and now
and now this is great this looks
fantastic I'm gaming it 4k pitches I
mean obviously it's hard for you to tell
exactly the quality that I'm seeing
right now because
you know obviously I'm rendering this
video out at 1080 and uploading it to
YouTube and there's compression all that
sort of thing but it looks really really
good to me and I think the trade-off
here is worth it in my opinion I think
that getting those extra pixels really
make the game look a lot sharper and
despite the the filters the various
filters that you have to turn down to
normal the game still looks better than
it does at quad HD with a lot of those
filters turned out well this also leads
to questions about the GTX 970
in general is it still a good card
because it's only three and a half gigs
well I think it's still a good card if
if that's if three and a half gigs of
video ram suits your play style for
example if you want it to game if you
want to play this game at 4k and you
still wanted some of that extra
additional eye candy you know like msaa
and whatnot then I I don't know I don't
know if I would recommend the 970 is
someone who's who's looking for that
kind of gaming experience however if
you're like me and you're satisfied with
the way this looks or you just you know
you're like me and you game it something
lower than 4k regularly like I gave it
quad HD I'm at 2560 by 1440 95% of the
time and so you know obviously at that I
have a lot more leeway and I can crank
up the settings a bit more and the game
looks fantastic but yeah if you're a
power user especially if you're using
like texture packs or you're doing a lot
of mods like you're playing Skyrim
things like that you're gonna want that
extra 500 gigs that extra 500 gigs goes
a long way like I said I'm at I'm at 3.6
gigs of video ram usage right now and
knock on wood that I'm not getting any
kind of artifacts for tapping into that
slower bank of memory that's a board my
GTX 970 but um it's just uh it's just
you know that it is what it is and you
have to make the call for yourself based
on your specific needs as a user so do
you think it's worth having that higher
resolution having those extra pixels and
turning down a lot of those filter
I don't know what's the trade-off you
know how did the scales weigh in your
guys's opinion I'm really curious to
know but this has been a cool video
thank you guys so much for watching I'm
