mid-tower features a sleek aluminum

the front and top respectively and

dismantle of all modular design step up
your case game was the a500 aluminum TG
and click on the link below for more
info so my mom has this friend who she's
known since high school that she still
keeps in contact with and I actually
grew up with this woman like she's
basically family to me auntie Glenna hi
auntie Glen if you're watching and
auntie Glenna has a 13 year old son
named Brandon he's very much into gaming
right now he's on console not sure
exactly which one but he's really
looking to get into the world of PC
gaming he particularly according to his
mom really wants to play games like
fortnight and well fortnight I'm sure
he's got other games on his list but the
important thing here is that he's trying
to elevate his gaming experience with a
full-blown desktop PC which is pretty
exciting now he has a budget of about
$500 and his mom told him that I would
be building him a system for $500 little
does he know that I've actually got a
bunch of sponsors to chip in on a 2 to
$3,000 high-end gaming PC that will be
surprising him with by the end of the
video so that's what this is all about
today so it's gonna be really exciting
to see his reaction we have a seriously
drool-worthy line-up of hardware for
this one guys that extends beyond the
tower itself because as a console gamer
I don't think Brandon already has a
gaming keyboard mouse headset and
monitor so we're gonna be hooking him up
with peripherals as well the whole
enchilada every single thing he needs
really to get started into the world of
PC gaming we should be pretty exciting
so I'm gonna call off the parts one at a
time as we go about the build so you'll
slowly but surely get an idea of the
kind of beast we'll be assembling today
or you could just look at the links in
the description below but where's the
fun in that
don't you like surprises have you no
sense of adventure
to quote the great mr. clause you boring
sack of toys ok so I kind of lied
because we're actually revealing like
half of the parts right now but that's
only because we need these components
for our very first steps to building
this PC so for starters we have the
Rison 720 700 X for our CPU eight core
16 thread processor super great for
streaming gaming I don't know if brandon
plans to stream but that's definitely a
possibility with the CPU
he wants to tap into that later down the
line it's also got higher clock speeds
right out of the box and better
overclocking potential than its
first-generation counterpart and of
course with great overclocking power
comes great responsibility so to cool
that chip we have the NZXT kraken x 50
to 240 millimeter liquid area which is a
fantastic unit as well we also have the
asus rog Strix b 450f gaming motherboard
from asus this thing is an absolute
prize I really love the way it looks all
the ACS boards are just fantastic
especially from the ROG Strix line and
there's a bunch of i/o here as well
including multiple M 2 slots USB 3.1
gen2 and the list goes on
we'll be pairing that with a 16 gig dual
channel kit of g.skill trident z RGB
ddr4 at 3200 speed and these fast memory
frequencies will help us make the most
out of our horizon processor while
directly improving in-game performance
so if you'll excuse me a minute I'm
gonna mash all this stuff together and
we'll get this build under with so the
motherboard is pretty much all prepped
and ready for case installation NZXT has
provided their flagship H 700 I in black
and blue because Brandon really loves
the color blue according to his mom this
thing's built like an absolute tank it's
mainly steel and glass construction
through and through it has a built-in
smart hub that controls the RGB lighting
strip that's pre-installed and it can
also create dynamic fan curves on the
flies it's a wonderful wonderful case
amazing cable management and it comes
with four fans right out of the gate
powering the system we have the
tried-and-true EBG a 750 watt g3 80 plus
gold certified fully modular and just a
beast of a unit as well in its own right
our storage setup is pretty
straightforward we have two drives for
our operating system we have a 240 gig
HyperX fury RGB two and a half inch SSD
we also have a two terabyte Seagate fire
CUDA which is a mechanical drive I
thought I was buying a three and a half
inch drive when I purchased it but
apparently we got a two and a half inch
drive but that's fine it's still 2
terabytes of storage nonetheless and the
nice thing about these fire Cudas is
that they actually have a smaller
capacity of built-in NAND flash storage
cause if you're loading times from games
now
locations so again links to all this
stuff can be found down below let's
carry on
all right we're getting down to the wire
here just a couple more steps to go
we're actually gonna use some cable mod
pro series mod mesh extensions for
Brandon's build look through there black
and blue just like his case so we're
gonna get all fanatic and matchy-matchy
these are really great quality cables
and then to top it all off the moment
that a lot of you guys have probably
been waiting for the GPU we will be
using this is actually a donor part my
own favorite GTX 1015 this is gonna be a
solid performer you know these are
pretty underrated cards and honestly I
am totally full of crap this is not the
card we're giving him just thought I
would control a little bit this is the
card that we're giving him this is the
asus rog Strix r-tx 2080 and it's an
absolute animal the cooler on this thing
is amazing it's super quiet for one
those axial fans some of the quietest on
the market right now also the max
contact technology that Asus uses keeps
thermals to a minimum you've got a dual
BIOS switch and a bunch of other
features that make this an all-around
amazing card so it's one of the few
cards right now that's actually worthy
of being in today's pill on that note
let's get this thing unboxed and finish
this thing up
all right the build is done and it looks
really really good
wifey sauce actually thinks this is one
of her favorite bills that I've done and
I kind of agree it looks great
not too many complications at all with
this build it was super straightforward
I only hit one snag and that was the SSD
our HyperX fury RGB after I loaded
windows onto it it would sometimes boot
into Windows just fine and other times
it would say you know boot media not
found
I changed cables I changed SATA ports
everything the only thing that worked
was changing the SSD itself so I've
actually swapped it out for a T force
Delta RGB actually did a video on that a
while back
great SSD unfortunately it uses a three
pin addressable RGB header not a four
pin and this motherboard has no three
pin a RGB headers on it so there's no
LEDs it's just not lit up so that's kind
of unfortunate but apart from that it's
still a great SSD works just fine 240
gigs same capacity actually no this is
250 gigs so hot but that was the only
real hiccup we encountered the build was
super easy apart from that especially
inside of the lovely H 700 I just a
fantastic case to build and really we
are far from done people this is not
over yet because we still have all those
peripherals that I mentioned earlier so
let's bring them out one at a time here
huge shout out to Asus for being not
just the sponsor for our graphics card
and motherboards but for all the
peripherals that are in this video as
well that also means that they all
support or sync so Brandon will be able
to coordinate all the LEDs on his
peripherals with the lighting in his
system that's pretty cool this is the
asus rog Strix flair this is the same
keyboard that i use at home
granted it's a new model I'm not giving
Brandon my old used flare what I'm
saying is I like this keyboard a lot
it's got genuine Cherry MX switches
there's a volume scroll wheel a little
customizable led badge you can update
some under glow lighting and the USB
pass-through a bunch of other stuff here
so fantastic keyboards next up we have
the ROG pugio poggio hood GUI I'm sorry
I don't know how to pronounce this but
it's an optical Gaming Mouse and it it
looks really nice I haven't actually had
a chance to try this thing out yet but I
really like the shape it looks to be
ambidextrous and it looks like you can
actually swap out the switches for you
know customized feel configurable
modular magnetic side buttons it's a
really nice looking Mouse not exactly
short the price point is here for
Brandon it's free so it doesn't matter
that we have the ROG Delta get a little
cramped up here this is a
headset it's got a quad DAC that means
it's it's got to be four times as good
as a single deck headset right that's
clearly what that means from what I've
heard through the grapevine these are
supposed to sound pretty decent yes even
for a gaming headset it's also got two
different pairs of swappable ear cups
supposed to be really comfortable it's
also got a noise cancelling boompole
microphone but I have saved the best
peripheral for last
Brandon is getting hooked up with an
asus rog swift PG 279 gaming monitor
this is a 27 inch IPS 2560 by 1440
g-sync supported 165 Hertz display
that's up that's all I need to say
really this is an extremely beautiful
monitor with a ton of performance packed
in and Brandon will be able to drive it
with this system I mean we've got a
risin seven chip here with an RT X 2080
so he'll definitely be able to push the
frames and pixels on this thing no
problem I think I think that's it holy
moly I think we're ready for the big
reveal though let's do it
but before we do I want to give a quick
shout out once again to all the sponsors
who chipped in for this project
including Asus NZXT g.skill and EVGA
this wouldn't be possible without you
guys also my aunty Glenna thank you for
this opportunity and she actually
covered the costs of all the parts that
weren't able to get sponsored for this
project so huge shout out to her as well
now as far as the big reveal goes let me
get you guys up to speed really quick so
we're all on the same page
Brandon's initially gonna get led to a
decoy PC like a $500 decoy PC it's
actually gonna be the Walmart PC kind of
funny and he's initially gonna be told
that that's the build that I built for
it but then shortly after I'm gonna pop
out and drop the real surprise with the
full-blown PC and peripherals all hooked
up powered on ready to go and hopefully
we'll catch a cool moment there so
that's how it's gonna work
let's see what Brandon thinks of his new
setup
hi stranger
believe he's like so tall Glenn well
this is your PC you want to check it out
okay can look at it Kyle's in the
bathroom but he should be out pretty
soon and if you have any questions or
something you can you can ask him okay
hey hey how's it going good to see you
it's been forever how's it going man
Brandon it's been a while yeah so you
were like what five my gosh how you been
yeah good yeah wait is this the computer
mom this isn't though why'd you bring
this one out no no no this isn't this
isn't what we're giving Brandon though
yeah this is what we're giving Brandon

the mouse we wanted to surprise you
Brandon for Christmas this was
orchestrated by your mom my mom myself
and a bunch of a bunch of awesome
vendors so you can take all this home
tonight and we really hope that you you
enjoy it you know you don't need to say
anything man
you just need to game on this non-stop
just start ranking up in fortnight you
know and once you go MLG cut me a you
know some commission from your checks
we'll call it even
okay what's going through your mind
right now like I don't know yeah it's
crazy
what are you gaming on right now a
console er which one guess what
have you been wanting to ascend to the
PC master-race lately or three years ago
yeah yeah what made you want to switch
play get a different experience and to
do homework to cuz you know I just have
a little laptop right yeah well wait for
your mom to leave and then we can have
the real conversation oh you're doing a
great job right now were you uh were you
