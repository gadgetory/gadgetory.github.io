what what the hell are you doing here oh
yeah just in the area so I thought I'd
dropped in see how you're like my note -
OH - dude help them how the hell did you
get in here
bathroom window was open so I just
crawled in through there breezy by the
way your a/c was like not even on man
it is hot your Ida crank that these
chips are pretty good can't even off
that one did you know that you only have
basic cable like basic basic so did we
launch a Netflix not everything belongs
in your living room for a quiet and
compact companion check out the node 2
oh 2 from fractal design you can find
more info in the description below
what's up guys so the concept of today's
video is something that I've sat on the
fence with for quite some time now
because it's so far outside the realm of
anything I've done before but after
enough contemplation I realized this
kind of video would just be too much fun
to pass up not to mention I've already
indulged in stranger things here on the
channel so today I will be doing a
handful of impersonations of some of my
favorite tech youtubers with Halloween
just around the corner I felt this would
be a good opportunity to dress up and
play some different roles so hopefully I
can do them justice well I will be
poking fun at each person along the way
of course these impersonations are not
meant to be offensive in the least I
have nothing but the utmost respect for
each of these guys and I'd consider many
of them to be my trustworthy pals let's
hope this video doesn't change that so
without further ado guys here are my
celebrity tech tuber impersonations for
2015
so yes if you happen to be in the market
for a new solid-state drive and you're
on a fairly tight budget this SSD from
crutial might be a great option but that
pretty much wraps it up for this video
guys before I go I did want to mention
that half of my house burned down
yesterday after a massive earthquake
which is why I'm currently fuming with
anger as you can probably tell feel free
to subscribe to my youtube channel so
you never miss another video also go
ahead and click that like button because
you're all decent human beings and as
always thank you for watching oh boy the
microphone wasn't recording this entire
time well I tell you I have never been
more upset
hey guys this is Austin there's been a
lot of buzz around the iPhone 6 but here
are some things you should consider
before buying although what packs one of
the best rear facing cameras on the
market the front-facing camera only
sports 1.2 megapixels which isn't great
for taking selfies and while the a dual
core processor zips along with ease I
was disappointed at the phones one gig
of ram considering its a flagship device
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one
all right today we're taking a look at
this nerf gun from nerf and it's got six
bullets or darts and this revolver thing
you get a smile inside to the top here
because uh you know sculpture from noobs
and there's some engrave text on the
side that says do not aim at the eyes or
face so that was your intention might
want to read over nerfs Terms of Service
so that you know what you're giving
yourself into moving along here at the
front there is a camera the hell's our
webcam doing this thing is it recording
we've got a kind of information does
nerve hope to gain from spying on kids
you know what I think we're just gonna
have to cut this review short guys I
don't think tech semuc it's gonna be
reviewing another nerf gun anytime soon
unless it's all black we then we may
check out one of those
hey guys Jerry here aka barnacle YZ and
today we're going to be unboxing the
junk box for the month of September aka
October yeah ok it's the month between
August and October yeah
for those of you who don't know junk box
is a monthly subscription service where
each month they send you a box of
collectibles as their way of saying oh
you think that like me with all this
crap so let's dive right in with our
trusty bat-knife by the way in case
you're not familiar with a special
edition old to maker printer that I also
3d printed I would a 3d printed a
replica of my wiener but I ran out of
filling it ladies
as you can see this card has 390
millimeter fans which push downward on
the aluminum heatsink and this thing is
definitely on the longer side so it
might not fit the tight spaces get your
mind out of the gutter
clearly this card would do fantastic in
a high-end gaming PC but what I'm
probably gonna end up doing is mounting
it to my bicycle because for one the
added weight will help me burn extra
calories during my 50-mile bike runs
that I take during my lunch breaks and
to because I have 15 of them in fact
Little J has really been getting into
mspaint lately so next week I'm going to
try to water cool 9 of these bad boys in
SLI for her new system
so after posting our recent guide on
building your own Nvidia grid
supercomputer many of you voiced
concerned that much of the hardware on
the channel lately has been a tad Oh out
of reach for the average consumer
so today's focus is centered around a
budget gaming rig featuring the cheapest
CPU we had on hand this 18 core Xeon
processor whoa whoa whoa whoa hold the
phone Linus that CPU retails for several
thousand dollars how could that possibly
be anywhere near a budget gaming PC well
I'm glad you asked because for a limited
time on slick deals you can use offer
code Linus to get 20% off select Intel
CPUs guys thanks for watching like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked and stay tuned for
part two of this video which premieres
tomorrow on vessel
alright guys I think that 10 minute long
cinematic intro is enough teasing for
today so let's get started with this USB
flash drive review Kingston has really
gone the extra mile to create a
beautiful design with these device
complete with brushed aluminum finish
this truly is one of the best looking
flash drives I have seen and it looks
almost as nice as the shots in this
video the unit is retractable for
protection and durability which is
especially useful in bringing this drive
on the go I love how the light shines on
the enclosure and in case you were
wondering I am using a broken BES clamp
that I got from a garage sale - like
this shot and it still looks amazing so
I'm giving myself a damn good award
alright in there you guys have it
hopefully you enjoyed watching this
video as much as I enjoyed making it and
also be sure to let me know in the
comments whose impersonation you felt I
perform the best before you gonna like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you thought it sucked no wait that's not
right Oh God
