are you hungry oh yeah actually uh
Paul's wife mrs. Paul's hardware gave
this to me and apparently I didn't even
realize this is like a famous spicy
ramen like people have people do
challenge videos trying to down this
without dying I'm up for the challenge
how about you wifey I don't know this
chicken looks like he's in a world of
hurt right now he's holding a bomb that
doesn't seem safe hot chicken flavor but
we look at the ingredients and it's
apparently vegan everything's artificial
you didn't know wifey sauce was a vegan
it's probably cuz you haven't talked to
her for more than 15 seconds ok looks
like we're actually gonna give a proper
lunch because we are actually
legitimately hungry but we will be
saving this for later on in the video so
stay tuned you're away so lazy why don't
you pay rent don't you help us with
chores so lazy in a kiddy way why don't
you like that ball is it cuz you haven't
had your your kitty smack on it yet oh
it's pretty good huh oh yeah that's the
stuff this is what addiction looks like
people
you gettin violent with it I think this
is laced with PCP you junkie cat the boy
doesn't care cuz he's not an addict he's
high unlike you got Lance and every time
we do a vlog you're eating limes
especially beer ICP Cole I probably
shouldn't show that
right into your wifey sauce Cheers
what's on the menu spinach enchiladas
and they are so good that is a metric
ton of beans I'm actually not gonna be
standing next to you for the rest of the
day I got a lobster burrito looks like a
12-inch er well that was delicious
lively salsa night literally did not say
a word to each other for the whole 10
minutes we were eating our food we
should not talk to each other more often
yeah where we going now we don't we
don't need that they're not that great
they're necessary to make like cinnamon
roll cinnamon rolls are overrated
they have Dole Whip oh they have Dolvett
dough dough the concept of doy this is
quite simple delicious pineapple sauce
sir he used to be you could only find
this at Disneyland but lately he's been
popping up in other places
might give me some give me now you're
horrible at spooning I am good at
forking right so we're still kind of
full not quite ready for the spicy ramen
challenge just yet but wifey sauce and I
both agree that we want our own pack we
want our own packet cuz we're fat so
we're actually gonna go to an Asian
market that's down the street from the
house and see if they had excuse me
ma'am can I have your spicy nudes can
you give me some spicy nudes of yours
yeah thanks oh hello nudes come on
they've got to have it how many news
there are sit no that's not it
oh yeah it is this is it it's the 2x
spicy come on let's buy before there's
none left all the candies that they have
here what you doing girl you're not
working you're definitely not working if
you're in this good of a mood well I
just found my happy birthday card from
my parents which actually includes an
Amazon gift card Hey No give me my gift
card please so as I was saying my lovely
parents got me an Amazon gift card for
my birthday hundred dollars hell yeah
let's spend it let's go spend it right
now we shop in we shopping personally
Amazon gift cards are always challenging
for me because I already have everything
I could possibly want and anything that
I could potentially see myself buying is
usually work-related and in that case
I'm not supposed to use personal
spending for that I have to use my
company credit card that way I get the
tax write-off and blahdy blahdy blah
guys what what should I buy what should
I buy right now you know what I'm
actually gonna tweet I'm gonna tweet you
guys right now you guys always have
terrible ideas I'm gonna ask you what I
should buy with $100 Amazon gift card
right now all right there it is it's out
there and now we play the waiting game
all right let's see what you guys
suggested a gift for wifey sauce
terrible idea thermal paste and send it
to the verge like the idea but I think
it would be better coming from Lisle
something you don't need but like three
months from now you say to yourself damn
I'm glad I bought this thing I already
have a butt plug my soul sorry George
what I'm trying to spend a hundred not
five baby oil I already got that Lube
already got that me I'll pass
sequin home decor pillow covers Nic Cage
pattern I need this in my life
Oh wifey sauce would never let me have
it though okay if I don't get off to
Twitter I'm never gonna buy anything so
I've actually picked out three things
that I seriously want the chameleon
chameleon
this is actually a card game sort of
that I've played many times with friends
and family it's an awesome awesome
awesome super fun party game so I'm
really glad to be giving that finally
I'm also getting a 12 volt DC portable
air compressor for my car it's good to
have one of these in my car especially
since I've been giving a lot of flats
lately so this is definitely more useful
that gives me some peace of mind and
finally I got two bags of Lay's ketchup
chips these can only be found as far as
I know in Canada stupid and they're so
good but I never buy them online because
they're $15 for a single freaking bag
but if it's a gift card who cares that's
the point of a gift card which brings
the total to nine to 7-eleven so thanks
mom and dad I really love my birthday
gifts because I picked them out myself
now we're on our way to an LA Kings game
hockey hockey and we're picking up my
mom mommy saw mommy with bit mom hi

wise young Wayne Gretzky once said you

random guy for correcting me play of the
game right there play the game so we
went to the Kings game had a great time
we're back home now so it's finally time
to fulfill our promise by undertaking
the spicy ramen challenge
alright alright for this I guess I
pulled my hair back this is well spicy

instincts are telling me not to eat this
right now I'm excited it looks delicious
alright let's do it ready all right a
little bit
not exactly hurry up cheers Cheers tasty
trick hmm kick hits you instantly a very
thick sauce - the flavors really good
though it's not crazy hot though yeah
maybe it's like a built I think it's a
building rapid heat

lower I'm actually sweating a little bit

is that a spice it up that might be a
spice and you stick up and give it I
don't get that often my mouth is
starting to I'm trying to feel it a
little bit just catch it up just
catching up with me oh the hiccups or
full throttle you know I don't say
things are spicy often but this is a
very expect this is objectively spicy

I might not be able to finish this it is
it possible to die from hiccups no okay
