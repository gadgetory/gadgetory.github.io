might have caught wind that wifey sauce
and I recently bought a house it's our
first house ever we're very excited we
haven't moved in yet it's actually a
fixer-upper and it needs quite a bit of
work which is why we got a pretty good
deal on it but I want to show it to you
today I just want to give you guys a
grand tour mainly because it's a huge
milestone for for wifey sauce and I and
it's also going to be the new bit wit
office for now the current studio that
we're in we're actually gonna be moving
everything out of there and this is now
bit with HQ so I guess it's somewhat
related to the channel apart from just
being a sort of personal vlog but here
we go the inner max lick fusion 240
millimeter all in one liquid cooler
features a one-of-a-kind RGB sink water
block with built in flow indicator
static pressure optimized RGB fans and a
high efficiency ceramic bearing pump for
exceptional durability and noiseless
operation click on the link below to
learn more now for starters you'll have
to forgive me for not wanting to show
the front of the house just for obvious
reasons I don't want people driving by
and recognizing it and then my address
leaking out somehow so we'll start here
at the entryway so we have a nice we
have a nice door I'm not going to show
you the full door either but it's blue
but this is what you first see when you
walk in a mirror I think wifey sauce and
I don't need to get security cameras
because anyone who breaks in through the
front door we'll just get spooked by
their own reflection and they'll just
head the other way I don't know how we
feel about this we actually get scared
every time we come in here we're not
used to it yet so that might stay if we
get used to it or it might go away
sometime later but there's gonna be a
lot of changes to this place and then
you also have this wall that looks like
a Christmas gift it looks like a
Christmas gift just waiting to be
unwrapped and repainted the sort of a
fork in the entryway here you can either
go down the hall and there's the three
bedrooms three bed two bath house or you
can go left and explore the rest of the
house there's wifey sauce ayane and here
on the left of the entryway we have our
family room this is like the nice or the
fancy room this is what I call it where
you have the really nice furniture that
no one ever sits in it's where you put
the Christmas tree and stuff like that
and we are sort of in a woodsy area here
in LA but just to make us feel more
connected to the ocean blue carpet of
course as much as we love the sea wife
your sauce and I have agreed that this
is probably gonna have to go
oh yes oh yes let's let's take a look at
the switch first mime switch the mime
switch we're definitely keeping this in
fact we're gonna try to find it and then
just put it on every single light switch
in the house right totally then we also
have some nice big windows here a lot of
natural sunlight little doorway here and
that gives you access to the dining room
and there's kind of a straight shot to
the livingroom area which we'll take a
look at in a sec kitchens over here we
got a sort of a big fireplace that's
very Game of Thrones II we might keep
the fireplace but just kind of redo the
the actual style the dining room is huge
which which I really like you have a lot
of cabinetry here there's a ceiling fan
we might swap that out but it really
gives you a lot of space for a large
dining room table so that if we have
friends and family over for lunch or for
dinner or just want to play some
tabletop games we have plenty of room to
do that here the kitchen is also really
nice IMO I think it looks good YP sauce
is it likes most of it for the most part
she likes it too but there are a couple
minor things that we want to do just to
make it a little bit more our own we
want to paint all the cabinets not sure
what color yet but we also want to
change the knobs they look a little bit
dated and stuff but for all intents and
purposes it's a pretty solid looking
kitchen you know pretty nice stove got
wasn't that thing called a hood
it's a hood we got we got a hood that
double oven though wipey sauce really
likes the double oven this is kind of
her domain I don't really do I don't
spend much time in the kitchen but she's
digging it so far the fridge was
included so that was that was cool and
then it's kind of interesting because
right next to the kitchen you have the
laundry area so there's the laundry
hookups washer and dryer and then sort
of another door that leads to the
backyard and we kind of want to separate
this especially because you know we have
those two pesky cats and that massive
self-cleaning litter box that needs to
go somewhere this is really the only
place in the house that it could go but
we obviously don't want it next to the
kitchen so what we might do is just
build a wall right here right behind the
the stove here and then create a door
going this way that way you can still
have access to the kitchen from the
hallway so this is the hallway the the
first fork in the road that I show you
guys earlier with the bedrooms here we
are again back at the front of the house
and let's go down the hallway here so
first of all we have a closet some
closet space
one place to keep the bodies this is the
first bathroom one of two this is the
guest bathroom I suppose and it's look
at this mirror like what's going on here
it looks like they paid extra to have
seven years bad luck this is the design
this is the actual that was intentional
toilet looks like a great toilet but
we'll probably change it anyway the tile
obviously here is really dated in the
shower this probably needs to be
completely redone whether or not that
gets done sooner or later and we're
still deciding we have a lot of other
things on our plate like the roof the
roof needs to be changed we need to redo
all the plumbing as well because it's
still original galvanized the house was
built in 1965 so we need to switch that
over to copper ASAP and then you know
the actual aesthetics of things can come
later and then we also have our first
bedroom
so again ocean carpet we have a nice
ceiling fan here and the weirdest kind
of sketchiest looking closet doors I've
ever seen we'll get rid of those things
but they are sliding so that's good oh
look they left behind a little little
nightlight for us bonus ad and if we
mosey on down here more cabinetry this
is the the dungeon room this is the room
that gets the least amount of natural
lighting it's just that one window and
then look at this brick what's going on
with this brick oh it's a retaining wall
that's right so it's a retaining wall
but what's what's going on with the
paint I mean it can still be a retaining
wall and not look hideous
can it so yep paint job paint job
incoming there so this bedroom is
probably gonna be like the office area
sort of like you know where our editing
stations will be because it is so dark
that actually helps us in a way so we
when we're doing color grading and stuff
we actually have a pretty decent sliding
glass door here or closet with some
interesting shelving there as well I may
also do some shooting here because
sunlight can make things trickier when
you're trying to shoot being able to
control your lighting with with your own
lights and stuff is pretty key ah
lighting punch so this might also be a
shooting room I haven't decided yet as
well as the first room that I showed you
that's also gonna be probably a shooting
room and additional storage the last
bedroom here is the master still the
same carpet but now we have a nice
pistachio green to the walls again
flooring and walls in the entire house
is going to be redone ASAP probably
before we move in and then this is the
master bath
so it's it's tiny it's not very not very
impressive or anything but hopefully
with some love and care and by love and
care I mean completely ripping
everything out it should look a little
bit nicer the master bedroom has the
largest closet as well it almost spans
the entire width of the room and it is
mirrored so since this bedroom is the
last one down the hall you can kind of
see or at the end of the house and we're
gonna walk back towards the front we're
gonna turn right go back to the dining
area and the last actual room of the
house is the living room this is the
part of the house that wifey sauce and I
fell in love with the most because it's
a nice big open space we really wanted
something to grow into something that
wouldn't feel cramped you know a nice
big common area for hosting friends and
family get-togethers and things like
that
what's that lying about what oh it's not
what's your favorite part oh I don't I
don't even know who you are anymore
all right okay I'll just give me a sec
so this is the part of the house that I
fell in love with the most wifey sauce
does not agree but it's a great space
for entertaining and there's a lot of
potential here even though it has its
own quirks so we have a step that goes
down sort of a weird multi-level thing
and then it goes back up so basically
this whole area starting from starting
from this step all the way to the end
where that window is this is all an
add-on and the reason why they lifted
this part of the room is because of
drainage if you actually had this whole
area flush with this floor then water
would most likely creep into the house
should a heavy rainstorm or some
flooding occur to make matters even
weirder we also have a really low part
of the ceiling here so I am relatively
short I am five-seven and you can see
here if I had a wider lens the ceiling
is right here there's only maybe a foot
or so over my head and so people who are
taller or obviously going to have issues
or potentially hit their heads when
they're walking in or out of this place
so what we want to do is actually take
this roof because the whole place needs
to be removed anyway so in the process
of that we have a really nice pitch
ceiling here and we're actually gonna
extend it all the way potentially this
is all assuming that things go smoothly
which totally always happens we're gonna
extend that all the way so that this
entire area this entire white part will
look just like that and I think wifey
sauce wants to also dry wallet so you
don't actually see the wood paneling but
it's just it's just going to look
like more white wall and then we'll
actually lift this whole wooden area to
be flush with the carpet here and the
tile there so it's all just one even
level this is definitely gonna be the
biggest renovation project that wifey
sauce and I undertake before we move
into the house so hopefully when it's
all said and done it'll look a lot nicer
in here and be a bit more practical as
well that's also kind of an interesting
little outlook window from the kitchen
you can see right there
so when wifey sauce is cooking or
whatever she can keep tabs on me while
I'm watching the game I actually don't
watch sports eSports game and then we
also have this weird space helmet it's
actually a fireplace and it's a really
really old one and it's not safe
actually the inspector came in and was
like you should remove this this is a
fire hazard never use this and you know
it's also really ugly so why Vsauce and
I are gonna take that out as well and
then wifey sauce is favorite part of the
house allegedly is the backyard oh well
if you sauce wanted a fairly large yard
it's a nice yard I like it because
there's not a ton of grass oh yeah
there's no grass that's even better
because it's just less to maintain
things like that kind of has a desert II
feel obviously there's a lot to be done
back here but there's loads and loads of
potential like the rest of the house and
also that's not even it like there's
this weird other patio area and this
barbecue pit here just looks really old
we'll have to I'll have to remove that
at some point there's the the door that
leads to the the laundry room there's a
sliding glass door that leads to the
living room so two ways to access this
area or get back into the house so yeah
yeah my stuff lots of big trees nature
and stuff all right now I told you guys
I wasn't gonna show you the front of the
house but I kinda lied because I want to
show you the garage this is a garage
door so now you know what our garage
door looks like but since we are working
out of home at least for the time being
this is going to be partial storage it's
a two-car garage nothing fancy but it's
space and this way we won't actually
need to buy like a public storage unit
or something like that
not sure what's up with these stains it
looks like something from dune came here
but they left a really cool workbench
here it's small but it's really cool
it's kind of old and vintage II with
this sort of Pixar lamp on it we also
got this built-in shelving just ready to
go so very much looking forward to
working from home again obviously there
are pros and cons to working in an
office but I think this time around
working
homes gonna work a lot better for wifey
sauce and I because we have more space
than we did in that 10 by 10 room and my
grandparents place so we're gonna have
more room to be organized there's not
gonna be computer cases just in every
single room things like that and overall
I think we're gonna be a lot happier
here by the way if you guys are worried
at all about awesome hardware don't be
Paul and I are still gonna make the
drive to each other's place every single
week to do the show this place is
actually not much further away from him
than my grandparents place was so there
it is guys this is wifey sauce a nice
new house and we're so incredibly
excited to turn it into a home and
invite you guys into it with with our
videos and stuff moving forward also a
huge huge thank you to our friends and
our family especially who made this
possible literally impossible without
you guys so thank you so much from the
bottom of our hearts and finally thanks
to all of you just for all the support
that you've given us over the years or
even if it's just recently we really
appreciate it we also wouldn't be here
without you so thank you that's gonna do
