ant-man tonight I mean obviously the
movies gonna butcher the original
storyline but come on he's like the most
underrated character in the Marvel
Universe
hey screw ant-man man let's go to Vegas
the venturi fans from fractal design
make everything cooler that's right even
you check the link in the description
for more also guys welcome back to my
custom water cold belt log this is build
like six I can't do six because I'm
holding the camera with my other hand so
six whatever where I'm gonna be doing
some hard line tubing for the rig in
case you didn't already known you have
been following the series so far I
already put some soft tubing in there
didn't love the way it looked so I'm
going to be pulling it all out today and
replacing it with some hard line tubing
that I'm going to be bending myself and
oh by the way the entire video is going
to be taking place in my car I'm totally
joking I'm actually on my way to Paul's
house because Paul has some tools I need
as well as the ability to kind of guide
me throughout this process it is my
first time and he's done it once before
with his Arctic Panther build it's
really cool turned out really great with
his hardline tubing you can go check it
out on Paul's hardware his personal
channel but he did get the help of Jays
$0.02 Jay is a custom water cooling
maestro and he definitely taught Paul a
lot about hard line tubing so hopefully
Paul can hand some of those lessons down
to me so that's what I'm hoping for so
I've got all my gear with me today got
my backpack with the the fittings inside
of it as well as my laptop in case I
need it I've got the PT G tubing right
there sorry it's really hard to film
with one hand while driving at the same
time my rig back there I did not buckle
it up I'm a terrible PC parent and I've
got some more tools back there I'm
totally looking for it I have no idea
what you're seeing right now probably
like a can or something back there but
yeah I've got a bunch of stuff back here
I'm bringing it all the Paul's and we're
hopefully going to be able to knock all
this out in a single shot so say your
prayer for me cross your fingers and
let's all hope
goes well alright guys so here's the rig
of the hour as you can tell I'm at
Paul's humble abode I think he's outside
doing some stuff but here it is as you
can see I took out all the tubing and
the liquid drain the whole system I also
put in these new primo chill fittings
which are compatible with ptg tubing and
hey look it's it's a Paul in the flesh
I'm filming okay say say hi to all the
people hi all the people that that's
Paul it's hot outside it is very hot
outside but it's nice and cool in here
which is good for computers so I guess
at this point we're just going to use
this heat gun some PT G tubing and we're
gonna start bending this and
hopefully we don't mess up right I hope
that never happens don't film me I don't
know what I'm doing we're joining you
ladies and gentlemen you're joining us
here this is Kyle's third third Bend you
know maybe four spins report is actually
attempting his skill has been slowly
improving and doing a great job actually
from the get-go it's working to avoid
bubbles though so check here if you guys
won't try this at home is I hold the
tube over the heat you got to put the
black tube inside that tube though first
the silicone tube then twist it slowly
as Kyle's demonstrating right now and
you have a chip
that's not part of them because it sir
she has soft in the middle part you're
going to be able to bend a little bit
maybe I really want to bend in tail to
get soft enough to bend
are you ever gonna bend this to Cali
okay now here we go trying to bend it
really tight I'm trying to make a
perfect 90-degree angle and I don't want
a very wide Bend because I'm gonna have
to bend it again like right here without
making it look like an S but more like
how to focus sucks you suck I know how
to focus on things but not when it's
burning me alright now here's the tricky
part got to cool it dump it in the water
but you got to make sure to keep the
shape when you're dipping it otherwise
it'll freeze in that wrong position so
90 degrees looks good boom and hope for
the best take it out and just like that
it is pretty much solid now let's solid
again it's beautiful and a little bit
less than 90 degrees but I think it's
workable
to bring everybody up to speed
Kyle Kyle's got a little crazy
here's his progress
got this got this been done let this
been done everything's looking pretty
good Kyle did all this
I actually all I did all I did was this
one I did that one right there taking
full credit for that one hour but Kyle
in the meantime has decided to just go
all out with this last Benz he's going
like from here all the way here and down
and over and up and then so um I have no
idea if that's gonna work or full hold
up under the force of gravity but he's
just going for it
right now he's doing the bend actually
back to the CPU and then he's going to
do another bend in the middle right here
to go up I don't know I think it's
already it's already looking doubtful to
me
now let's stay positive Kyle I did a
good job you're doing a great job I have
to sit and wait for to see the results
of this but you guys get the same right
now this is the last tube being fit to
the Ghia the system here I'm just gonna
screw it down and and then we're good
Stoops crazy turns a tooth whacking ah
then just gotta kind of shape this I
mean it's a little droopy this is say
look like shaggy I mean the top like
across the top this looks fairly
straight right yeah I mean if I could
just maybe like find something to barely
prop it up like a millimeter or two I
think it looked pretty straight all
around yeah what's up guys okay so I am
back home now and I brought my rig with
me of course and here's a closer look at
it because you probably haven't had one
before but there it is I think it looks
pretty great
honestly this is so much nicer looking
to me than the soft tubing that was once
in here I'm really
I made the switch and special thanks to
Paul for helping me out I honestly
couldn't have done it without him I mean
I probably could have but it probably
turned out a lot crappier than this but
a couple things not everything went
perfectly I'm really happy that this
actually worked this whole big loop
around and how it's kind of going
underneath this this tube going to the
CPU I'm really glad that worked out
however there's a little bit of a bowing
out on this edge right here it kind of
bubbled up I held it a little bit too
close to the heat gun for just a second
and because of that it kind of got a
little distorted so I'm actually going
to be doing that one over again honestly
believe it or not I got this one on the
first try
this little one right here took me three
or four tries believe it or not because
um the bends are so close together this
Bend and that Bend I really wanted it to
be and I'm probably going to do this one
over to actually I know that I'm a bit
more familiar with how it all works
I really wanted to go straighter across
and then straight back but as you can
see it's kind of like at a 45 degree
angle which I'm not a huge fan of
honestly it doesn't look terrible and I
could leave it there but I still have a
bunch of tubing left over so I might as
well give it a shot the other thing that
I'm not so I'm not a huge fan of with
this long one is that I should have bent
it down a little bit more to the right
hello Kyle I should have bent it down a
little bit more a little sooner I should
say because with the side panel window
on it's a big side panel window right
there but it still kind of covers up
this portion of the tubing when you're
looking at it dead center
you have to kind of move to the right in
order to see that beautiful tubing right
there so I'm actually going to bend it a
little sooner right here try to not f up
on this part do this one over probably
and also I'm gonna have to redo this one
actually I'm redoing everything except
for this little guy here there's a few
scratches on it but it's it's so small
and it's tucked away so you can't really
see it and this one's perfectly fine but
the other reason I'm doing this one over
is because I'm waiting on a Y fitting a
little splitter fitting so that I don't
have to actually have my drain valve
crossing over the outlet right here I
can just use one splitter fitting for
both of them and so I'm going to do a
hard line I'm probably going to go
straight out straight back and think
I think I'm gonna go straight up and
then straight I'm just gonna do it all
hard because I don't like the angle
right here just kind of clashes with the
rest of the straight tubing which
reminds me and this is all building off
of stuff that I learned today if you are
going to be doing right angles in your
hard line tubing build which if you're
doing hard line tubing you probably are
get like a box or something that has a
right angle inside of it so you can
actually as your right right after you
bend the tubing and you're trying to get
that perfect right angle press it up
against one of the corners of the box
for example so you know you have a
perfectly straight right angle because
it's really difficult to try to get it
perfectly unless you're you know a
master at this like Jay or something but
that would have really helped me also
it's kind of hard to gauge where to bend
the tubing I mean you you hold the the
piece of rigid tubing up and you kind of
eyeball it and you put your thumb okay I
want to bend it right here and then you
bring it over with your thumb to the
heat gun and then you just kind of go to
town but the whole time you're kind of
guesstimating where exactly you put your
thumb and sometimes you get it and
sometimes you don't it's really hit or
miss so honestly what I'm gonna try next
time when I reduce some of this tubing
is I'm gonna mark exactly where I want
to bend it with a sharpie and then wipe
it off with acetone after it's finished
and I think that's gonna result in some
really clean really clean looking tubes
in the end also you want to be aware of
fittings and part of the reason why this
little guy appears scratched is because
I think the fitting right here was kind
of like rubbing up against the edges of
the fitting we're rubbing up against the
edges of the tubing and it just cuts
into it really easily the just the
slightest you know jolt back and forth
it can can result in some pretty nasty
scratches so just be really careful and
gentle with your tube with your tubing
as well as the fittings when you're kind
of sliding them up and down and getting
ready to screw them in and I think
that's pretty much it guys so let me
know what you think of this build what
you think of the hard line tubing think
of my work again this is my first time
so I know it could be a lot better and
it probably will be a lot better after I
give it a second go but again special
thanks to Paul for helping me out
honestly a big help
huge help and thank you guys for
watching this video be sure to subscribe
for more tech videos coming really soon
and
by the way I'm getting married next week
so if I'm not as active on social media

next week
that's probably why and please forgive
the shortage of content in the next week
