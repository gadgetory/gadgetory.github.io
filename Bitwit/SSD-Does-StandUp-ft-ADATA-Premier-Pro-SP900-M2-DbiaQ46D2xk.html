you were such a bad public speaker
thanks everybody good night nicely done
kamijo that was beautiful now next up is
an MDOT - SATA SSD on the rise who shows
great promise with his fearless
confidence and wicked punchlines ladies
and gentlemen please give a warm welcome
for the adata Premiere Pro SP 900 thank
you thank you it's really good to be
here tonight now I already know what you
guys are thinking and that is that I'm
pretty tall for an MDOT - you know I
mean I'm 22 by 80 so I think that's why
I went riding in a small car it always
feels like a long drive but that's
probably why I don't get out much - you
know I play a lot a lot of video games
and I prefer a mouse and keyboard when
I'm playing but I'm kind of stuck with
this controller at the moment it's a
sand force get off the stage so so so I
use mlc nand which is great but it's
asynchronous and people always give me a
hard time about it they're like hey man
synchronous is faster you should get
some of that synchronous manned man I
like to call those people manned
believers identity' fat SSD once who
knew she didn't support trim thank you
you've been great okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
