channel today I have a very special
unboxing for y'all it is the one and
only HTC vive the virtual reality
headset this literally just arrived on
my doorstep no more than an hour ago I
actually stopped what I was doing I was
working on another video when it got
here I completely dropped that just so I
could film a really quick unboxing no
this isn't gonna be very information
heavy it's not going to show you any
benchmarks or even any experiences
this is strictly me taking crap out of a
box only because it's a really cool
product that I've been looking forward
to opening or checking out for a really
long time I don't think I've done this
excited for a product since I don't know
that Nintendo GameCube
maybe the n64 even so this is really big
stuff really exciting stuff it's
actually also kind of funny because I
was expecting my oculus rift to get here
first but due to the component shortage
that I'm sure a lot of you are aware of
this ended up happening first which I'm
totally cool with so on that note I have
a knife here this is the knife guys this
is the knife that I'm going to use to
open the HTC but this is the table that
I'm using to put the HTC vibe on there's
so many historical things happening
right now I can't contain myself let's
go ahead and slice this pricker open
whoo okay so here we go
oh wow it really is that big this is a
big box this is a big-boy box alright so
um it's actually not as heavy as it
looks despite me moaning like a little
girl it sounds wrong get this guy look
at that look at that alright beautiful
but really simple you get the vive
branding here as well as HTC get a nice
little cartoony looking diagram of the
headset itself and up here in the corner
says steamvr powered let's go ahead and
flip it over to the back side there's
nothing on the back side let's go back
to the front side and open this sucker
up oh oh what's this first thing first
thing is a paper uh that's nice it's
really nice oh oh oh oh everything so
oh my gosh all right so we've got got
the the motion controllers here comes
with a package of two pair of two I
can't talk right now I'm so excited
so yes can't wait to get my hands on
these later and we've also got some of
these I believe these I believe these
are the cameras motion tracking cameras
that you put on either corner of your
room to track your movements this must
be the headset with a very long cable
attached to it look at that
thank you your beauty huh Oh selfie I
got to break them in oh it's not even
connected yet and it's still amazing how
is that possible it's just like but I'm
so impressed all right cannot wait to
check that out later okay what else we
got
I'm like a kid on Christmas morning all
right let's move this box there's
probably stuff underneath it okay I've
got some adapter stuff cable and adapter
this I believe is the mounting bracket
for the two motion tracking cameras is
that it is that all the things those are
all the things maybe oh no no wait what
is this you've got more stuff in here
whoo another another foam pad for the
the visor for the headset microfiber
cloth cables cables adapters and what is
this got a HDMI mini DisplayPort USB 3
and DC power so this is a clearly an
adapter pass-through type of thing for
connecting the headsets to your PC I
would imagine but hey those is that
everything that's everything man get a
warranty guide and it's in English
Francois and espanol I I speak all three
of them based on the color of my skin
but hey guys thank you so much for
watching this little unboxing here I
know it was kind of vain wasn't really
super info heavy or anything like that
it was just kind of like hey look what I
got but rest assured this does mean that
there's going to be a lot of VR content
from my channel coming soon and also
feel free to let me know in the comments
what kind of things you'd like to see
with this particular headset or VR in
general since I will be getting the rift

maybe months who knows but that's going
to do it for now guys be sure to toss me
a like on the video if you enjoyed it
