so sells drunk is so drunk I seriously
did not touched it how did you do okay
use paste in there well the the text was
gone the the link itself
I see so cells cell I see your cursor I
see you I see you you caught caught
Redford already right there what are you
doing with our links buddy I'm gonna
tweet out hey everyone welcome to Calais
a bustling hardware hey welcome this is
episode 167 side beef he missed side a
it's on Paul's channel you can check the
link in my description and go to youtube
me Paul sweet is hardware no stop doing
things me Kyle used my laptop last week
I had him do anything cuz he logged into
all of his accounts all I can do is
tweet from him just be yourself Paul I'm
trying to be me
a cell said I don't know it's it's
posting shit in other places this is
weird
what's it Google Google has got a mind
of its own drunk shit alright so welcome
to shit on awesome hardware occasionally
we drink beer and use foul language
right yeah if you're sensitive of that
then you should we just transition us we
transition into my have so seamlessly
forgot we have to like start over and
yes so yes
don't language keep on top beer hey buy
stuff from our stores oh yeah stores my
store is a bit with tech slash store or
you can just go to a bit with no tech
but that's easier I've got things there
and and and by the way anyone who
purchase something on paul's half will
get a johnson shout out during the after
party so stay tuned for that also anyone
who donated will read your messages soon
and then so yeah desk mats mouse pads
mugs pint glasses i'll run their shirts
go to pulse store to paul's harbor net
paulist√£o worried that there would you
be everything to be everything sure it's
been a sock he's also got lots of things
saying a lot of the same things that I
do but his design but it's got my logo
he's got his logo his designs and he's
got his own Paul flair to it suck them
all we're gonna yell John's - you really
loudly like look super loudly like no
one's here at the office anymore so we
can be as loud as we want
will top the charts for you and then is
there anything else we need to say here
any more beer I don't think so you have
the beer I think you need more beer -
you're in charge of everything for this
round
oh no I can't tweet what can't just log
out as me like why do you stay logged in
in fact I feel uncomfortable that you're
chosen they lock me logged in on your
laptop it's a little disconcerting Paul
that I have been logged into this
computer your house last week my
password isn't saved too much effort
no I sign alright so you keep keep your
passwords on station I should safe and
dandy I can add the after party link to
my video description up there you go all
right so we've got some news to talk
about why don't we dive right into it
first off the core I nine ninety nine
hundred K has officially hit a world
record blasting seven point six
gigahertz by the one and only der Bauer
of course this is an article from hexxus
Thank You hexxus that's not her Bauer by
the way then display v' slave slave
split pores
slave pores I love the caption
straightforward no bullshit so on
October 12th Intel was hosting their
fall desktop launch event featuring the
9900 Kade a bunch of EXO sears extreme
overclockers we're trying to break a
bunch of world records including mr.
devourer
roman he's good guy he's very very
knowledgeable about this stuff and he
was able to hit seven hundred and seven
thousand six hundred and thirteen
megahertz on all course with some liquid
helium
that's a dim expanders I've seen this
whoa that looks like a dim dot too like
a dim got to type thing before your RAM
wait what's the point of that so you can
oh maybe so on a dual what I don't
understand how that works so if you only
had city okay no of course not
both you're reporting on it wait so he's
got oh okay so but it's basically an
expander so okay so he can fit four dimm
slots or four dims into a to dim slot
board all right god I didn't know that
existed that's kind
cool I have to grab one of those um so
anyway 7.6 gigahertz is absolutely
insane but when you're dealing with
something like liquid helium it
definitely becomes more possible um he
used the asus rog Maximus 11 Jean Z 390
motherboard with eight gigs single
channel single channel DVR for memory
and whoa there's a lot of a lot of ln2
smoke going on there there were other
xoc years like slave and forget the
other guys there's a bunch of other
people they broke like 16 benchmark
records combined
I believe it's titled liquid helium Kyle
oh sorry this this is the Healey sorry
helium Healy
whatever helium nitrogen they're
basically the same I'm just I'm just
trying to trigger slightly different
elements my goal look right now is to
just trigger everyone and property
mainly all the all the chemists in the
house no ok so correction it is liquid
helium that he is using thank you Paul
so there were 15 global first place
records in the eight core category
achieved obviously this is the the
highest clocking 8 core CPU we've seen
in a while and wow that guy looks was
that an overclocker
hmm look like my grandpa I was just
interesting to see him like overclocking
stuff
and then there's also been a new world
record in PC mark 10 against all other
processor categories so Wow looks like
your Bower is getting a hand with this
helium he's got he's got help I feel
like all those guys broke that world
record that had a lots of people man in
the rod yeah you know all their hands on
Romy's right so congratulations and well
job well done mr. Roman thanks for
pushing the limits of this hardware I
imagine that everyone in this picture as
they're like just talking amongst
themselves and discussing things have hi
hi chipmunk voices because of like just
Oh although all the helium helium liquid
in hey Liam inhaling in helium inhaling
there's a deadly helium yeah what I
would expect really helium so that's
that's cool yeah mm points it's
literally hey okay cool
absolutely chilly so cool moving on
though we've got this this issue that
the tech power up has has brought to our
attention here about SLI and gsync
causing framerate issues this is
interesting there were some users that
noticed performance issues on their SLI
systems recently and skip one no exes oh
wait this is the gpu-z story you're not
talking about that no this is Google
being a dick okay I'm sorry yeah they're
men okay so um techpowerup found that
okay so so there are some people saying
hey my SLI system is performing under
par it's not it's not enough and people
found that there seems to be a problem
when you have SLI and gsync enabled
simultaneously it actually tanks your
performance in certain titles some more
than others
extreme tech actually confirmed the
framerate drops when both technologies
are enabled and the issue seems related
to timing to timing according to the
data but there's really no clear
solution yet maybe this could be patched
with a driver update who knows no
official word from Nvidia yet but some
titles like I said are affected more
than others in The Witcher 3 you go from
113 frames per second down to 75 frames
per second with you know SLI and gsync
enabled versus not or I should say SLI
it's probably SLI with g-sync versus SLI
without J sync is right so 113 to 98 not
terrible definitely significant but
maybe you wouldn't notice it necessarily
but then rising storm 2 for example 206
frames per second geez down to 75
horrible that that's that's like that's
crazy that's less than half that's
insane yeah so the test setup included
two gtx 1080s and an acer XB 280 h HK
which supports 4k at 60 Hertz made it
really easy to tell any any kind of
discrepancies here between the two
configurations inconsistent behavior was
found between the games so in Deus Ex
mankind divided the gap appeared only in
DirectX 11 mode in Far Cry 5 the penalty
size actually increased as the framerate
rise rise rise had risen got bigger got
bigger um so in hitman and hit mans
results were even more confusing so it's
it's really kind of hard to say or
predict how this weird phenomenon is
gonna affect your your game because it
depends on the game but it is a problem
and there's no solution right now and
Nvidia said nothing apparently the issue
seems isolated to anything before Turing
so Turing doesn't seem to have an issue
with this which is why their test system
was using 1080 so now it's just another
underhanded sneaky technique for Nvidia
from Nvidia to try to get people to buy
the latest generation of graphics cards
and I'll take the goes right along with
them working the performance of all the
cards with updated drivers it's rampant
these days this is true apparently this
isn't really a new issue though it's not
true ok
[Laughter]
I'm sure that's thus far it is now that
you said it but now some people some
people exited the video break right
after I said that I believe that good
job so Tom's Hardware has already
there's actually forum post on Tom's
Hardware dating back to 2016 about a
year and a half to two years ago
regarding this issue so apparently this
isn't something super recent people of
experiencing this for a while now
it's just now being brought to attention
on a bigger scale and hopefully now that
it has Nvidia will do something about it
because that's it's no good you know you
usually you usually uh SLI and gsync are
technologies that are reserved for like
people who are willing to pay out the
ass right and then want the create the
greatest experience possible and it's
kind of ironic that those are the
technologies that are actually hurting
performance in certain scenarios so
hopefully if I get so ironed out the
more you know there you go
maybe maybe it's also sign that
you can just stick with a single card
yeah I mean why am i single talking
about sli related and people are like oh
I'm considering SLI this versus to
single this we're usually like yeah I
get the single card cuz stuff like this
like when I when I like build crazy
custom water-cooled systems I only do
SLI because it looks more badass yeah
having two cards in there it's purely
visual thing really visual it's just
like I've got the bigger CAC but you
know what even if the cock doesn't
perform as well as the smaller cock it
still looks more impressive to the naked
eye
pun intended so yeah I guess that's the
light sort of the same way moving on
here ASIS and there's e3 90 motherboards
have been recently found to push
software into your windows installations
this was discovered by techpowerup once
again during their testing they notice
that there's covered bases as well and
and and poly oh yeah thank you by the
way for sharing these articles with me I
did not have much time to this one I
think you found yourself oh did I maybe
okay but but I forgot to thank you for
for scouting some of the other articles
oh yes no problem I'm just saying I also
experienced this oh did you because I
used one of these ASUS motherboards and
I saw this but I tweeted about this with
that with the last generation one of the
other mm ASUS motherboards have popped
up okay but yeah basically clean fresh
Windows installation with nothing else
going on
you got an asus motherboard you plug it
into Windows and you get this pop-up
that says issues armor and creat driver
auto update manager would you like to
download and install the asus armory
crank driver manager asus armor and
create as a service helps you manage and
download the latest driver updates yeah
it's it's it's asus bloatware that like
you know i don't know some people might
find it useful to have any handy in the
background apparently there is an actual
BIOS setting there's a BIOS setting that
you can change right will make that not
pop up this this correlates to a piece
of script that will will actually
install certain files into your system
thirty-two folder without your
permission so it's it's the months you
don't even need to connect to the
internet it's like nope the motherboard
does it yes that's garbage yeah so it's
it's kind of sketchy I feel like you
know the whether or not this asus Armory
software program is good or bad is the
is like an irrelevant question and all
this it's more so how it's being rolled
out to users and the fact that this
setting in the UEFI which is also kind
of obscure and kind of hard to find it's
like within the tools category the fact
that's that it's enabled by default I
think is a bit controversial give users
the option and disable initially and
maybe have something on the home page or
on the home screen of the desktop that
says hey if you want this option you can
enable it in the UEFI here's how to do
it they could have taken a much better
approach to this even if the software
whether the software is good or bad it's
just a matter of how they've delivered
it to users kind of slipped it under
their noses and the fact that this
setting that's automatically enabled
when you buy the board is installing
files to your your system32 folder
without any sort of user interference
without any sort of permissions because
it overrides all the administrative
rights and permissions that you know you
just it's by the time you install this
motherboard and boot it up for the very
first time all these files are installed
and it's tapping into your registry and
all that so it's a little bit invasive
and this this type of behavior is pretty
is not uncommon on OAM builds and like
laptops for example we've seen this as a
prime example is like I think lenovo
like super fish and shit like that now
obviously that was a really bad piece of
bloatware that was it was it was a
rootkit and stuff like that but the fact
of the matter is when you're building
your own PC I think there's more of an
expectation of having greater control
over what's on your system right that's
kind of part of the reason why we do it
ourselves sometimes so I feel like it's
I don't think Asus meant any harm by
this I think they're just trying to roll
out software that they genuinely think
users can benefit from Asus develops
companion software that goes with their
hardware they're much boards and their
graphics cards and they put a lot of
work into it I think some people see it
as helpful and useful other people see
it as something that's gonna use up
system resources and pop up and prompt
you to do an update when you had no
interest in doing anything like that so
for some people yeah maybe it's useful
but I think Asus approached this with
the idea that we need to get this
software that we invest our time
developing rolled out to more users now
let's create this way that it'll just
automatically get installed just like
Windows you know just like Windows
Update or something like that right and
I don't know personally I don't like it
at all
yeah definitely not absolutely not I
don't mind if they leave it disabled on
boot and by default that's fine but
don't enable certain permissions to
install files to my system 32 folder on
my very first boot I don't like that at
all
and also there's issues with cyber
security here because if there can be
any sort of vulnerabilities but that can
be exploited there is little way to fix
it but with BIOS updates from Asus
themselves so there's there's a whole
security issue here to that again
you're being unbeknownst to you or
you're being signed up for from the
get-go so yeah it seems pretty innocuous
on on Asus as part they just need I
think their their rollout plan here
needs some tweaking some serious
tweaking needs a sixth week and and more
transparency more transparency for the
user exactly what you're signing up for
when you boot up an asus motherboard so
yeah i'll continue to be a supporter of
asus boards i just hope that they learn
from this little full finding and we can
use if you're looking for user feedback
on this we don't like it we don't like
it don't do it you've heard it stop it
you heard it first here well second here
first it take the power out them and
then us all right moving on i'm trying
to find when i tweeted about because i
tweeted about it was one other last
boards hmm and it was a while back
though so XIII 70 maybe I maybe it might
even have been an AMD board I can't find
it like this here oh you posted a
picture look guys there's here oh oh
just bring him to the office you having
to bring him here yeah I mean how would
he be if he if you brought him here into
like this a place even but you were here
he'd be okay he'd be fine no he's very
chill oh yeah
the only thing he gets upset by is being
separated like I don't like being by
himself things I do yeah so yeah maybe
we'll have a bringer bring your dog to
work day here here it here at my office
yeah I'm fine all right let's move on
we've got one more article to talk about
before pip my PC Samsung has filed a
patent on full display fingerprint
sensors for notch less bezel free next
Galaxy next-gen Galaxy phones um this is
from hot hardware thanks how high rate
the patent describes technology for
embedding a fingerprint sensor into the
entire display meaning that you could
just put your thumb anywhere on the
display on the screen and there will
unlock or or give you you know
authorization for whatever apps that
utilize this function that's a good idea
we're just pretty cool I mean that that
would remove essentially remove the need
for having a pesky sensor on the back
earphone put your thumb here which is
crazy how quickly things are advancing
here because your thumb here or her or
here or here that's gonna be the key
note that's big yeah could put your
thumb or you pull your phone out of your
pocket and it's upside-down by accident
you can put your thumb sure so I think
it's pretty cool it's crazy how fast
things are advancing you know at first
the fingerprint sensors were at the
bottom of your phone on the front of
your phone and there's I got it sold
news is not organized put on the back
put on the center back of your phone oh
my god is amazing and then like two
three you're like two years later it
seems like that's old shit just make it
anywhere on the screen
and it seems like a little thing but
it's not because when you're unlocking
your phone 50 times a day
convenience in that sense the user
experience really really goes a long way
so they've created a patent they made a
patent for this and it's gonna change
everything
this is also an alternative to facial
recognition which I'm not a huge fan of
actually not a fan of at all
I would never enable that feature I saw
Austin tweeting that like his facial
recognition on his phone just stopped
working yeah I would at least never have
it as a screwed you're just like no your
phone doesn't recognize you anymore
I'd never have it even as a or at least
as a exclusive option like if I did
enable it who knows maybe I'll enable it
one day but I would never have it as the
soul the soul authenticators like there
should be a backup what happens if
you're like in the pitch-black dark you
need to unlock your phone
oh shit like that anyway there's this
whole mess of issues beside besides that
but anyway it's kind of cool you can use
your phone you can use your thumb
anywhere to pull this off Samsung plans
to embed the sensor the fingerprint
sensor into the actual display layer and
this would be powered by a second lower
processor so very very low it wouldn't
drain battery much the display would
essentially go temporarily into into
high brightness mode with three
different scans taking place the main
concern here is how long it'll take to
register a full scan because according
to the patent
it'll take 60 to 90 milliseconds for all
three scans but the processor and it
there is what does ACS grid driver auto
update manager and how is it suddenly
appearing with this pop up on a
completely clean Windows 10 installation
yeah yeah this is the this is a
predecessor to the armory crate do you
know what platform this was can you tell
I don't use this picture bring up and
conjure up any memories I'm yes I'm
curious if it's on building there might
have been one of the rise in
motherboards okay so this is something
they're rolling out on both yeah both
sides
but they did have an existed and never
mind me gonna but see that doesn't
matter because even if you never
remember me like according to the
article that I was reading today if you
reboot it resets all that shit and so
everything starts all over so even if
you were to delete it from your system
it thee since it's this code this script
because in the UAF I will just boot all
over again and so the only ways I've
really get rid of it is to disable it
within the UEFI which most user is
seeing a pop-up like this on a fresh
clean install they're like I think oh I
have to it's just some setting of the
you have to disable so it's it's very
not transparent right shut up about the
htpc look at how long the hood paul had
to scroll for years just to get to his
last HTTP see video which he still
hasn't done the follow up to this one
day one day we will have justice oh my
god it's been well over here part one
delete the part anyway doesn't exist so
this is cool anyway you know the
processor that handles this brightness
adjustment for the fingerprint scanner
would need 200 to 300 milliseconds in
between each one each of these
brightness scans to adjust the
brightness totaling 700 milliseconds
okay 700 milliseconds is a long time to
wait but hopefully Samson can pull this
off will most likely see this technology
introduced into the next Galaxy phone
which would be what Samsung Galaxy S 10
I don't know
also Samsung will probably continue
their quest for a fully bezel free phone
which which means no not their galaxy
nya and their Galaxy Note 9 or whatever
did not have notches neither of them had
notches which I'm a huge fan of just a
straight black bar across I'd rather
take like a just a slim top bar black
bar at the top which is why if I upgrade
to a pixel 3 I am still once again going
to with a non XL model
because I just despise the knotch that
much I'm not a very opinionated person I
don't have many opinions which is
sometimes like shitty but I have really
strong opinions about the knotch
and I can't I can't stand it I can't I
can't do it man I can't do it
I don't know I'm talking about not the
stare drop the tear what is that is that
like a mini notch where it's Jess
instead of one a notch it's just one
little bloop for the feel like a camera
lens I feel like that's even worse
what about that's even worse what about
a circle
we're not should be but like actually
separated from the edge it's just a
circle with the lens in it why not just
make do you do you see do you see how
small cameras are front-facing cameras
are on phones like just make the bezel
three millimeters who's gonna be like
then it's kind of yeah that's Camelback
and Marquez and all that all all the
phone reviewers would be like I got a
bezel no I can't even look at this phone
it's got a bezel it's disgusting most of
my face the bezel bezel the three
millimeter bezel will at least be a lot
less noticeable than the teardrop but it
looks like a big piece of shits on your
screen all the time and that's it just
gets me so fired up you know and it's
only a thing because Apple contention
it's only a thing because Apple kicked
it off and now it's like everyone needs
a notch because the iPhone acts as an I
don't I don't like the like how many
manufacturers jump on and and copy Apple
with stuff like the like ditching the
headphone jack like that that irritates
me yeah right
like like that's like removing feature
because when Apple does something even
when that something is removing a
feature it's suddenly trendy that's a
trend now oh it's trendy to remove a
feature that users have grown to be
accustomed to and love
over the years and actually utilize
Apple did it so it's not it's not bad
it's good anything Apple does is good
it's that mentality that I can't stand
because then you're right it trickles
down to everyone else the competitors
who we rely on to be different than
Apple are now copying the thing that we
you know the company that we we're not
necessarily our first pick so I don't
know that's the last story I have let's
move on to pin my PC I'm a PC you guys
have tweeted in pictures of your
dilapidated outdated and just all-around
scandalous rigs we do yeah there's
nothing I know oh maybe you should just
next time I come over your place I'll
bring that USB Drive
oh really quick yo that's that's my
that's my father-in-law god it's the
father-in-law Brad really quick he
texted me earlier today I didn't get
back to him he said on a scale of 1 to
10 really quick how much does Paul loved
his tesla powerwall cuz i think he might
be considering getting one so since he's
here in josh does i love it
how much does you love the power of all
I'm wondering 1 to 10 I'm thoroughly
happy with my decision thus far they're
really happy that's pretty good my power
bills and this is another promised video
that I am still working on and I will
produce because I want I want to have
one of a kind of a wholesome look at the
entire process from signing up to it to
getting it installed to like afterwards
I'm just well I need more data
I need more sure more time more more
electric bills to come in but yeah are
you planning to make a benchmark video
of your pet deer of your power wall I
think that would be super cool like you
can't you can't really benchmark it
because it's just there and it just runs
and does its thing it's it's affected by
how much power you use it's affected by
how much sunlight there is and whether
there's any cloud cover sure
so it'd be a very dynamic yeah so that's
you can't exactly do that for some
reason a bunch of people keep seeing
like like when we're doing the
overclocking competition that like can
you plug into your power wall to like
give more power to the answer to
computer and like nothing limitless
120 volts coming into all my plugs right
yes that doesn't affect that and even if
it did it would just break the computer
can't handle the heat I mean is
switching power supplies it could
probably handle up to 220 bit Hey
point being thoroughly impressed oh yeah
I've been very happy that I'm saving
probably 150 bucks a month plus so far
and is that like in the summer time or
is that just in general it has like
three months which is all the time I've
had to look at it so far right but yeah
a very very very nice drop and you know
I'm pretty confident at this point that
it'll probably pay for itself within
about 10 years yeah give or take and
everything in there's like it has at
least a 10-year warranty and a lot of
this stuff is fifteen or twenty years I
think you know I have an interesting
question really quick sir about sir but
I digress sorry Jay
can you you can I would assume that you
could move your power wall to a
different house if you were to ever move
in the next 10 years you can take it
with you or is it permanently tied once
it's installed you you could probably I
mean I don't know how practical that
would be I think I'm not I wouldn't I
wouldn't I'm not intending to do that
myself oh yeah I'm just pathetic like a
house and yeah I mean they they make up
they have a bracket they attach the
bracket at the wall and then they mount
it to that so it could be removed from
that so I mean sure that's possible but
I wonder if it also ups the resale value
of your house at all I would hope it
does but I don't know I mean that's
quite an investment that you have to
come and have them do a read every
assessment of my own value for that okay
thanks for shedding light on that yeah
all right let's move on to pin my PC I
started with a Yi Joe
sorry if Lyle was here he'd be able to
pronounce your name flawlessly the link
you put didn't work sad to go straight
to his Oh his you too
or his Twitter page Twitter has a
picture of lightning that's creepy music
computer all right there that's what you
yes yeah so um oh yeah yeah the leak
does not work maybe he deleted his tweet
and is not no longer no longer wants to
be featured this is here
yeah that's true that's weird I don't
know maybe I fucked up on copying the
link or whatever
Oh cells doing stuff on an AMD x47 60 K
that's an old older AMD processor using
one term at WD hard drive and a 125 gig
a data SSD kingston hyper fury 2 by 4
gig ram kit and an r7 370 4 gig graphics
card r7 370 what oh wow what is it 3
what 370 not 100% sure I just remember
it being made by sapphire and being 4
gigs yeah I don't think that's exactly
maybe if maybe if RX 473 and r7 now why
it's appears to be on a bed which is a
little weird and it also appears to be
sitting on top of some earbuds ok
those are your buds yeah those earbuds
are gonna improve airflow for sure we
have some just about the most horrible
cable management that you could possibly
have exacerbated by the fact that it's
probably a pretty budget power supply
with no aesthetic consideration when it
comes to the cables at all
so much dust to that power supply looks
gray very dusty memory kit well
functional is completely in contrast
than any other anything remotely
resembling a color scheme in the case
least of his worries though it's ketchup
mustard everywhere there's a I mean CPU
heatsink fans are there generally
functional
you have it this direction but I still
always feel like it's awkward I would
want to rotate where where do you live
coz if you live I don't care where you
live people should be earning this looks
like it's a Sarlacc pit or something
that shipped me your computer Alf
I'll pimp it out for you yeah seriously
there's also these two extra fans here
next to the harddrive cages which they
just look loud those look loud they just
look I can see the noise I can see how
all right so ye ye you you've got a
functional computer congratulations when
it comes to aesthetics I don't think
there's anything that we can tell you
it's a complete loss
you should probably upgrade your
platform anyway before work on the
aesthetics you're a lost cause you've
officially broken pollen count yeah x28
ASUS Maximus 5 formula intel i7 3770k
nice I saw that I saw three seven seven
zero K on a license plate the other day
we did it you can check it out true
story EVGA gtx 780 super clock corsair
dominator plats two by eight big sticks
at 1600 and looks like we've got a
Corsair obsidian 550d he likes the d
ladies and gentlemen um alright so for
starters you have a really nice
motherboard a very pretty nice graphics
card and a stuck Intel CPU cool stock
CPU cooler mr Sasson what are you
thinking on that city 3770k these are
Dominator platinum memories memory likes
the kids right that's a that's an
expensive high-end memory kit you pay a
lot of extra money for that over
comparable you do are they um often
times it doesn't matter usually it would
be the the two red slots here that the
memory would go on usually asus has you
pop it at the outer slots first but
often it doesn't really matter as long
as they're in every other slot it'll
still be dual channels
bothers me yeah I agree I would position
them in the outer slots to make room for
the epic upgraded CPU cooler that you
install there you go
yep beyond that I mean you got all black
cables things are looking to look a
little a little loose a little loose and
sloppy yeah I mean it's not horrible by
any stretch especially compared to the
last video last so that's true anything
that's good compared to that but
anything you can do to take these little
just loose cables that are that are kind
of lazily going to their their sources
and just cinch them down time tie them
down wrangle them a little bit but not a
say it's mainly that CPU cooler like
like swaps that out CPU cooler and like
tidy up cable management and if you
wanted to if you want to spend the money
like black and red extensions sure would
do wonders for this build
yeah that would look as nice as these
course area X cables are if you do go
that far then I would also recommend D
labeling your power supply cuz your gold
accents here from the eggs and 50 aren't
doing me any favors yeah PSU delete
thank you for your submission though
thanks Brad and next up is Montes with a
dark based Pro 900 mm case it's red
ripper 1915 MX the tech 360 TR for the
EVGA gtx 980ti for the win 3 30 40 50
skill flare X memory 3200 Castle ad 14
systems a blue zenith extreme X 399 what
a beast
alright so great specs here's user deal
I am slightly concerned about your
cooler then cuz it's stretched no
because the original version of the
inner max liquid tech is prone to
failure oh so much so that they recall
they made a successor to it if you look
at the Amazon reviews for example
they're they're not so hot
there's there's a liquid tech tr4 and
tr4 - - right right here and if they
updated so and I bring this up because
it was enough that people were like hey
there's t really wrong they had to come
out with an updated new version of it so
that's just something I'd point out and
granted when it comes to failure rates
with with hardware's you could be
talking about just a slightly higher
failure rate than normal which is enough
for them to do something about it yours
could be fine
but it's just something I would I would
be aware of so what was the main issue
was the pump was dying I think it might
have been the pump honestly I don't
recall specifically I okay yeah I just I
just know the tr4 - was created to
replace it yeah so yeah but beyond that
beyond that let's let's get back to to
aesthetics here alright so we have a a
Noctua situation went back to a fans
note - is always so torn about because
they're really good fans so we're in no
position to tell you to replace them but
they Oakley as hell but they're not
pretty but they ugly
they don't match oh they have there's no
excuse nowadays they have black
beautiful black fans they don't have
black versions of their they have the
the NFF and ff12 x 25s though they have
comparable fans that are killer
performer is better than most you can
find on the market that are black in
color neutral and don't look like
someone vomited a brownie there's just
crow max series they have industrial
series fans that aren't this color
consider that would look a lot prettier
I'm imagining these are just n FF
twelves their newest newest fans they
have not created an other colors up so
if that's what you're using here then
you can't get better than that at this
point so but if these are the older
versions then yes you couldn't swap them
out for the I believe either the chrome
acts or the industrial versions at least
get gray and black are all black and
that would look a lot prettier and I
would I find it interesting that you
have a mostly pushed configuration on
the radiator
with a single pull man he's probably
trying to direct more air flow to his
GPU that could be which may help a bit
it's okay does it it stands out a little
bit to me but I don't I don't hate it or
anything right
why does his that top drive look like
it's in a box but I'm not yeah I think
that's just the oh no the this case has
you have you work with the 900 deep
there the not 989 yeah it is the 913
dark breathe 3900 900 right so it's got
these cages that mount to this back to
the back plate and they kind of
completely surround the drive but they
have a barcode on the front of every
cage I think it's just open right here
and that's the front of the drive Oh
hard drives often have barcodes on them
for enterprise environments so you can
you can scan the barcode I see it just
doesn't look like a the front of a drive
yeah I think it's just a weird okay fair
enough
yeah beyond that um I don't know there's
a little bit of a bunch up of cables
down at the bottom that could could look
prettier too but everything else is
pretty clean and tidy I don't know if
this little loop of cable clean that net
up rotate the fan make it come up at the
top there sleeve cables PSU sticker
delete you're good to go
yeah solid advice okay next up Brent
brand Zeon build us a Nova X 50 675
overclocked to 4.5 yards hmm this is P
60 X 58 LGA 1366 motherboard 12 gigs of
g.skill ddr3 1600 megahertz ram to 2
gigs per dim by 6 and triple channel
configuration gigabyte geforce gtx 960
for Meg graphics card acquiring h5
cooler WD 250 gig hard drive 3 terabyte
hard drives see sonic power supply glue
Master mb 5 case master box el master
box yeah
and a black magic mini recorder you
capture card in there okay so first
thing I'll say is that you're the blue
heatsinks on your motherboard clash with
the red dims on your heat spreaders or
the red heat spreaders and your dims I
think it's probably easier to
spray-paint the the blue accents on your
motherboard red then it would be to
spray-paint your dims blue I disagree
really well the memory he could just
pull the memory out and and do a little
mod on it the for the motherboard you'd
have to pull them on the whole
motherboard out of there
that's it sure yeah but you have only
have one motherboard to deal with
instead of six dims all right well
either way either way either paint all
your memory blue to match the heat
spread the heatsink there pick your
poison paint your heatsink red to match
your memory dims sure and probably
alright so to further your point
painting this red would also match some
of the ports and stuff on the
motherboard elsewhere true so maybe
rapidly holy a little bit a little bit
cleaner overall yeah although then you
have like a blue PCI Express slot so you
can spray pin that to what it's doable
I appreciate the multiple views of this
system yeah I like that very very clean
cable management when it comes to like
the thing that we typically talk about
the most here looks like he's got a
custom super clean like panel like this
is the least this is the least
irritating I've ever seen
ketchup and mustard 24 pin cable B right
oh yeah somehow I realize oh it's routed
around so that you can't even really see
the the sleeve goes really out of the
cables here oh yeah so so well done
there yeah other than that it really
it's just a bit of colour mismatching
going on yeah I can excrete not easy to
to to modify so you know feel free to
completely ignore us there I would pull
this little blue cap off of your sli
bridge on your graphics
- I also don't think he would
necessarily need to remove his
motherboard from the case to spray-paint
it as long as he did a good job covering
it up with like newspaper and stuff he
could probably just spray pan I would
remove that heatsink entirely
oh the heatsink for sure yes the CPU
cooler yes but I just mentally yeah yeah
no I mean remove the oh the actual
heatsink the heatsink from the
motherboard okay separate so you can
yeah shoot it from if the CPU cooler cut
out for that case is large enough you
might not need to remove the motherboard
entirely if there's screws behind the
motherboard terrassa heatsink okay let's
move on uh see there's an in metal jaw
yeah we haven't honorable mention here
metal jaw I thought this is pretty cool
little setup here
he's dual setup that they're both
wall-mounted and this is a complete
custom sort of pegboard type of thing
these are wooden slabs and he's provided
the spec lists on each of the monitors I
didn't realize those were monitors at
first I thought those are just black
backgrounds that he had photoshopped in
there but those are monitor he's got an
old Troy on the left and a 16 by 9 on
the right it seems and the one on the
left is a little bit more high-end 6700
K with a gtx 980ti the other one is a
core i5 4570 with the gtx 770 seems to
be an asus fan with his motherboard
choice on the left and yeah in his
graphics card on the right so this is a
pretty sweet setup I like the fact that
you've got two TSA's pretty cool systems
side-by-side which would be great for
like laning and stuff also for the Horde
or the Horde yes the Horde the Horde -
the little emblem there will shield and
the cable management is really clean
I think the cable management really does
it for me here it gives me a whole big
old stiffy yeah you know you've taken
extra love and care with the system and
it looks fan freakin tastic so it's also
a great way the fact that like the power
supply on the system on the left is
sitting right here with a cable coming
into it and all the other cables coming
out that side yeah can't even see
anything right so
a lot of stuff is being passed behind
this board here yep so cool and it looks
the board looks pretty close to the wall
- doesn't look anything like that yeah
that thick so job well done job well
freakin done and that concludes my half
of the Shaw so I thank you very much for
tuning in don't go anywhere that we've
got awesome know you got a awesome
hardware after party after party about
to begin
pulsing to play some overwatch we're
gonna read off donations and she had
some Johnston's to y'all and just have
some fun so so that's linked in the
description if you missed my half of the
show it's also linked down there thank
you guys for watching hit that thumbs up
button thumbs up we back next week over
time stairs I don't hate you if you
times leave loves the time stamp maker
yes alright we'll be right back guys see
you soon I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
