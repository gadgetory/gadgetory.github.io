Squarespace the quick and easy way to
build an awesome website what's up guys
hope you're all well and I hope that
you're hanging in there despite all the
chaos and confusion lately I mean with
riots out your front door and social
media having turned into a complete
flammable warzone wasn't it nice when
the only things exploding were
smartphones and graphics cards now I
can't fix the world's problems hell I
can barely tie my own shoes that's why I
keep them permit I'd and wearing like
slip ons but anyway in a time where the
human race is more divided than ever
it's comforting to know that this
community stands united in our love for
technology so let today's video be a
common ground that we can share and
appreciate together even if it's just
for a few minutes now that said let's
move on quickly before we start singing
Kumbaya because that noise
so following my review of invidious
budget-based gtx 10:50 TI which i
benchmarked inside of my high-end silver
build for testing purposes it was clear
to me that the mashup of hardware might
not be the most realistic or sensible
configuration for an entry-level gamer
so today we're rebadged marking this
pascal card inside of a budget rig that
i put together for just north of 400
bucks on pc part picker at the time of
filming this should create an
environment that better suits our sub
150 dollar graphics card while putting
the pcs price point in certified console
killer territory kind of weird to keep
using that term though when consoles are
already dead today we'll also be
comparing the frame rates between this
PC and the one in my initial review to
see how much the gtx 1050 Ti is crippled
by lower end components so starting with
our only constant in this test we of
course have the MSI GTX 1050 Ti which
retails for just 139 USD I've also
applied the same overclock settings as
in my review with a core clock offset of
220 megahertz and 350 megahertz on the
memory clock on the CPU front AMD
continues to be a crowd favorite for
these budget builds so here we have the
athlon x4 860 K at a hundred bucks it
packs in quite a decent value for a quad
core chip however it'll probably be the
biggest culprit behind any performance
dips coming from the silver build with
its overclocked Core i5 6600 K
especially in CPU
tens of titles the Athlon chip comes
bundled with AMD's much-improved Wraiths
stock cooler which you can check out my
hands-on review of for a detailed
analysis connecting all the things is
the Asus a 68 MH + MF M 2 plus micro ATX
motherboard with PCIe gen3 support as
well as front and rear panel USB 3 I
snagged this and a single 8 gig stick of
Myshkin essentials ddr3 at thirteen
hundred and thirty three megahertz for a
combined total of just 80 bucks
now as affordable as SSDs have gotten
over the last few years there's still a
royal luxury for this kind of budget so
here's a $40.00 one terabyte Hitachi
Deathstar 7200 RPM good ol mechanical
hard drive providing the electric nectar
of life to our humble gaming PC is EVGA
s 430 watt W one unit for 30 bucks you
get a 120 millimeter double ball bearing
fan 80 plus white certification and a
power supply that won't cause a nuclear
meltdown last but not least we have one
of my favorite budget micro ATX CH a C's
the core 1000 from fractal design a
steel internal frame front panel USB 3
and included 120 millimeter intake fan
aimed right at the GPU make this case a
solid value for the 30 bucks I paid for
it totaling the final cost of this build
to just 413 dollars here's a
side-by-side look at the specs for
today's build and the one I tested in my
review besides the graphics the hardware
in these rigs couldn't be further worlds
apart so it'll be interesting to see how
they stack up with the same video card
all tests were run in 1920 by 1080 with
the nvidia 375 dot 5-7 little driver on
windows 10 ladies and gentlemen I now
give to you the gift of benchmarks
all right so pretty telling results but
nothing too unexpected
apart from that tomb raider score where
the budget pc outperformed the silver
bill by 7 FPS wait half of seven is
three and a half three and a half minus
1/2 is 3 half-life 3 confirmed yeah this
is lord gaben confirming that you are oh
damn it oh well at least we have the
steam controller still thanks for that
so I can't really pinpoint the cause of
this anomaly with Tomb Raider but what
we do know is that the budget Riggs
average FPS barely flinched in subtitles
and saw as much as a 38 percent decrease
in others when compared to the silver
built with several of our games being
CPU whores these performance hits aren't
too surprising when you consider the IPC
difference between a modern-day Core i5
and an aging Athlon chip as a result
users would probably need to lower the
quality settings on some of these games
to maintain playable frame rates
personally I think the x-48 60k is a bit
underpowered for this GPU and I'd
probably opt for something more akin to
an FX 8350 to help reduce or even
eliminate the presence of any
bottlenecking
be that as it may this little budget
system here scored over 50 FPS on
average in five of the seven games three
of which were on Ultra I mean bear in
mind that these are also some of today's
most demanding titles so the fact that
this 400 something dollar PC can take on
triple-a gaming is quite a testament to
the gtx 1050 TI's capabilities as an
entry-level 1080p card that makes the
budget vga market all the more
competitive meanwhile the three high-end
Nvidia cards who have still found zero
matches on tinder have since resorted to
circle jerking besides gaming there's a
ton more you can do with this budget PC
like browse the web draw a picture or
build a website with Squarespace
I've tried making websites with other
services or software in the past and I
remember the frustration I felt trying
to get the exact look that I wanted
bringing your vision to life with
Squarespace

design into the one thing I never
thought it could be fun
it's actually kind of fun once you dive

lot you can do with little effort then
the ideas start flowing and it can get
addicting pretty quickly and in the
unlikely event that you can't figure
something out for yourself they have a
super friendly support team who's ready
to help you out at a moment's notice
just message them to say hi I don't
think they like that though as a DIY PC
enthusiast I forbid you to pay someone

ton of money instead and do it your gosh
