yes stupid sometimes I overthink my
tweets I'll sit there I'm taking a
or something yeah it'll just be like
there for like ten minutes like wait how
do I want to word this what does it say
about me as a person well tweet sir
forever you know they can be easily
misinterpreted I know yeah there's so
much pressure people misconstrue them
and then suddenly you know you're mixing
you know you're a police puppy killer
yeah and people think you kill puppies
I'm like dude I just I just said I'm
gonna kill all them bitches didn't
necessarily mean I was talking about
humans though female let's talk about
one female women just one big ugly puppy
come on it'd be horrible guilty whores
starting after your side of the show on
the right foot that's what this episode
is all about damn straight
life oh we're live do you really I have
no idea hey everybody welcome to the
live show this is awesome hardware the
live show the pole and I do every single
Tuesday right here at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
Time on Tuesdays I already said that
welcome to the show this is episode 115
whether you've been watching us from
episode 1 or you're just tuning in for
your first time live we welcome you and
we say we love you and we're gonna have
some fun together we already actually
streamed Paul's half of the show we like
to split the show up into two halves so
if you missed that too scandalous you
can follow the link in my video
description if you're watching me on
youtube it'll take you to Paul's jail or
you can go to youtube.com slash Paul's
Hardware to watch site a it'll set up
the introduction and the sort of tone
for the rest of the episode may you can
come back here or you can just watch
this to have the show and be like I
don't even care what happened in the
first half
cuz whatever and my psychiatrist has
been telling me to be more present and
I'm looking looking ahead I'm here I'm
here in the now here in the now in the
present time I don't know
we're not here to tell you guys what to
do no we're not no we're not so you just
do you you do you will do us us
generally consists of drinking a frosty
beverage an alcoholic adult beverage
cheers to all of you who might be doing
the same if you're a legal drinking age
nurse in your country so fuse to that
and yes I have had a couple drinks yes
you can tell thank you very much for
pointing that out let's so let's do the
things that we always do at the
beginning of each half of the show which
is plug our respective websites yeah we
sell merchandise on merchandise that all
of you should buy immediately if you
have anything any money that you can
give to us use it in this way where you
can buy a limited-edition bit which in
navy tri-blend shirt it's awesome
incredibly comfortable I've never worn
one personally digit spinners are still
in stock do not know at first they were
a limited edition will not be restocking
them ever but they've been selling so
quickly that I might restock them I
don't know yet but they're there in
classic black there's also hats it
depends how long that trend just clings
to life as long as as long as fidgets
spinners are in is are in the limelight
and our hashtag trending they'll be
there but would hats are also for sale
you're going to a baseball game bring
one of those wear one of those hats to
the game while you fidget spin on a bit
with spinner and people will never ask
you anything about baseball no girl will
ever bother you yes you will never be
approached by any any intimidating women
nice time Meister all stored relatively
speaking is much less appealing because
I don't have as much new stuff pulse are
bred met those where you can check my
store out I just want to point out the
zero insertion force shirt because it's
still clever still clever after all
these years and it's more relevant in
turns more on the map for Rison now if
you're a rise in fan rise and zero
insertion force shirt is for you like
obviously these are zips sockets and
that is horizon it like if you're if
you're using an LGA processor whether
you're talking thread ripper or intel
stuff that is not as if socket it is not
a zero insertion for a socket
it's a fraud you're gonna be a good lied
to you never be a good shirt it's you
had a GPU that's like like think of a
GPU that's been Tory I had an oil wine
idea for a new shirt like a GPU that's
notorious for coil wine and saying like
don't you hate wine and then have a zip
socket CPU replying and saying I
actually prefer Zinfandels or as if and
else you have the one for free
yeah I'm afraid I'm just new sure that's
just for you new t-shirt coming soon cuz
we're friends you haven't given me
future design coming I have an idea for
one I have an idea for one I've had my
ideas better sword fight I'm not I'm not
telling you my idea I'm not telling you
mine okay cuz way better anyway alright
thank you get my idea fleshed out first
thank you Jeff for always supporting me
okay let's talk about some tech Jess as
usual we've got an 8700 case spotted in
the wild this is a core i7 Coffee Lake
hexa core allegedly this comes from
video cards calm so greener salt as
always they found a spec sheet from a
Chinese website pretty typical first off
let's talk about the core i3
8350 K that was mentioned it's a quad
core according to the spec sheet with a
base base clock of 4 gigahertz and it is
unlocked so and once again we're seeing
this trend of Intel starting to
implement unlocked core i3 which you
know beforehand before the last
generation of Intel Core CPUs that was
not really a thing so much so here it
whoa is it the 70-75 30k no 73-53 50k so
very similar sort of the same vein there
quad core unlocked very cool remains to
be seen how the how it all stacks up
against the competition but there were
also some first leaked images of the
core i7 8700 cake
from Baidu I don't is that's website
right I do it's a social social social
network social network okay in China
okay Chinese social again from China
some leaked images of a core i7 8700
right now is but I do the as a search
engine that's a web services company
it's Chinese
yeah it's China so some leaked images
came from China to different CPUs were
shown the image that you're seeing there
shows three CPUs but you'll notice that
the one on the very right is different
excuse me then the other two a search
engine for websites and fifty-seven
searching Community Services okay there
like it so probably something at Google
akin to like a Google and Google there
are Chinese Google cool um so like
that's where this information is coming
from you can see a picture of three
different CPUs actually or two different
CPUs that the two on the left are the
same according to the picture and the
one on the right is slightly different
based on just like the sort of layout of
the dye elements and stuff I'd have to
look at that more closely yeah um and
these images also came along with some
cpu-z benchmarks showing a single thread
performance of 23 23 or 23 hundred and
twenty-three and a multi-threaded
performance score of thirteen thousand
nine hundred and eighty which according
to the article is better than a 70 700k
by about four thousand four hundred and
forty three points which if they're
comparing if that goes for the
multi-threaded performance that's
basically putting these scores 46
percent higher than kb lake which seems
way too extreme so it seemed exactly
where it should be if it's comparing a
six core - no no this is the 80 no
that's the any 700k that's carry a
6-quart or four core that's exactly
where it should be I guess maybe you're
right I get yeah I guess if you factor
in the 50% more performance yeah okay
you're right
- this call - a few four
centage points for overhead or whatever
you want to call it ray
so that's that's reassuring I mean it'll
be interesting to see how hexa-core
coffee likes stack up against risin 5
because that would probably be the
competitor their core wise right because
risin 5 6 cores 12 threads and again it
really depends on pricing to whatever
Intel decides to price these chips at
will determine which rise in CPUs it's
going up against but I would imagine
risin 5 and yeah that's pretty much all
we have to go on for now that or if if
the IPC is still if they still have an
IPC lead over Aizen with these chips
which they should theoretically if it's
just a new revision some somewhat of a
14 nanometer process that is roughly the
same as what kb lake is yeah built on
and they can get away with bigger
quarters Intel might still try to do
something like oh well our eight cores
go up again there are six cores go
because they write for sure and and so
on and so forth yeah you could see them
doing and you know might work for them
if the performance is where it should be
I mean that's what ultimately that's
what most what happens most of the time
is the cpu price ends up being where the
cpu performance lands they're usually
pretty good at doing that I think it's
why people are pissed at Intel right now
is because the pricing for this guy okay
Skellig exto outrage is not lining up
with the performance but right skylake X
CPUs well I can't speak to the 7900 X's
right now but I know the 6950 okay
was that a nexus in the the the
Broadwell II mm-hmm apparently sold
really well the 69 the 7 the $1700 10
core 69 50 X apparently sold really well
so for all the people who are like 1,700
bucks for the 10 core and like so much
more expensive and whatever
lots of people bought it Wow hi yeah
like I'm surprised too I would just
think like wow that's a niche product no
one's gonna buy that yeah yeah according
to a couple different articles I read
recently sales for that from Intel
well sales outpaced expectations is is
how it was it was listed so that doesn't
necessarily mean they sold tons of them
or anything like that but it was a
successful product so for everyone who's
talking unlike the sky like X
processors that are priced between a
thousand and two thousand dollars if
their performance is there I mean
granted hopefully if thread Ripper is is
providing the proper you know Titian
then there should be some sense that
goes into the content a question of what
you invest your money in but you know
there's like if if it lines up with that
then I would expect people to like 2,000
bucks versus 1,700 bucks yeah and it's
an 18 core instead of a 10 core if
people are buying the $1700 one faster
than the Intel is expecting then people
are gonna buy the $2,000 one two I'd be
interested to see who like what what
kind of audience was buying the 6950
acts like if they were all like you know
small business like workstation type
stuff
or if they were like gamers or like like
where's ya never kind of blend it's hard
to say because it's yeah it's not like
the Xeon product where they have you
know a certain level of you know
stability I guess that goes into it or I
wouldn't be surprised if it was like
something in the in the financial
markets area because I know that's
another big sort of area of DIY PC stuff
that doesn't get talked about quite as
much as as people do financial market
stuff you want really really fast
computers but yeah I'm not positive I'm
not sure well you know AMD this year I
feel like has been having a lot of fun
at the least of their press conferences
throwing up these benchmarks especially
in the Cinebench multi-threaded tests
showing how their CPUs are hands-down
decimating the Intel equivalents
you know for the same price but you know
the the rise in SKUs have way more cores
and so there I feel like that's what
they've been pushing the most in their
press conferences like look you can get
way more cores and way more threads from
the same amount of money and coffee like
is like the first time really that we've
seen hexa-core CPUs in the mainstream so
that might all fall to for AMD
where whereas before like yeah okay
Intel had the upper hand when it came to
single threaded performance and higher
IPC's maybe now with coffee like at
least against the current offerings of
Rison we might see intel edging out the
competition in both single threaded and
multi-threaded performance it'll be
interesting to see if that actually
happens and what kind of effect that has
on on the market but again this is all
speculation for now most of it until
further notice so let's move on to our
next story that we have a lot more to
talk about knew there was some some
speculation that another unannounced
thread ripper chip was going to come to
market relatively soon and it's called
the 1920 those of you who have been
following all the news with thread
Ripper know that right now we've got
three confirmed SKUs from AMD when it
comes to thread Ripper we've got the
1,900 X we have the 1920 X and the 1950
X and this article from an antic van
come is saying that you know there might
be a fourth skew on the rise in the
thread Ripper group all of the 1920 non
x skew this is basically the they're
deriving this from the fact that there
are a lot of motherboard makers who have
this skew listed in their cpu supported
lists for various motherboards these
motherboards include very mainstream
boards like the asus rog zenith extreme
the asrock x3 nine professional gaming
and x3
Taichi Giga Byte X 399 gaming 7 these
were all published this week confirming
that according to these motherboard
manufacturers that there will be a 1920
non x skew coming soon again this is no
official words name makes you wonder if
there will be also 1999 15 on decks
right yeah but it would be interesting
why they wouldn't show support for a
1950 if if that were the case but but I
think it makes more sense that a 1920
would exist as opposed to a 1950 non X
because if you look at the price points
you've got the 1950 X at a thousand
bucks and then the 1920 X at just 200
bucks cheaper and then you have the 1900
X which is like way cheaper like 550 so
it would make more sense for AMD to put
a stop gap between their 500 part 500
other part and their $800 part right I
feel like that sort of closes the gap
between those two they're pretty far
apart compared to where the 16 core and
12 core parts are but interestingly
enough according to the article it's
speculating that the the 19 20 will also
have 12 cores and 24 threads as it as it
will support SMT which is the same as
the 1920 X so imagine maybe a six
hundred and fifty dollar CPU that has
the same core and thread count as the
1920 X but with lower clock speed
according to the article and half the
EXIF are so instead of getting that nice
boost f2 4.2 gigahertz they would only
go to 4.1 but again you could
potentially like overclock that and make
it all the same
the other difference is that the 1920
specularly will have a lower TDP of a
hundred and forty watts compared to the
higher-end risin SKUs that have 180
watts so maybe you wouldn't get quite
the the amount of overclocking
capability with the 1920 as opposed to a
1920 X kind of similar how we've seen it
on the 1600 versus 1600 X
or the 1,700 1,700 X that sort of thing
but again usually I feel like the non
excuse at least with Rison are the ones
that a lot of tech tubers including
myself and possibly even you have been
recommending when it comes to bang for
the buck so perhaps the 1920 X or I'm
sorry the non X the 1920 might be a good
option if you're if you're looking for
price to performance yeah if it's 150 or
200 bucks cheaper then than that and if
it's still unlocked they're all supposed
to be unlocked right everything's
supposed to be unlocked for overclocking
so it should just work so yeah yeah
so and certainly something that people
would be interested in because you know
the 1900 well it is 1900 X what is an
appealing CPU to like get people onto
the thread Ripper platform and get you
into X 399 and everything it's still
like an 8 core so I feel like there's a
certain level of like wow 1900 X is cool
and all but it's an 8 core just like the
mainstream rice and stuff come on you
gotta have 12 cores or something like
that right you gotta upgrade at some
point so yeah yeah I mean definitely
like you said there's a big gap so that
that's for sure a product that would fit
right in there right and and and some
people are asking chat how many PCIe
lanes that wasn't confirmed in the
article but excuse me everything and
Deborah there has 64 lanes
every thread Ripper AMD was very adamant
and very proud about that at their tech
day there's gonna be aiming that day we
go even the 8 core yeah even the a core
so if a cheaper $550 SKU has 64 the full
64 PCIe lanes then granted you know a
seven hundred six to seven hundred
dollar chip is going to have the same I
mean we can pretty much assume that
obviously anything's possible but you
know I'm pretty sure we're allowed to
say that right yeah yeah yeah we said
that we saw that last week yeah sort of
weird in between sign where thread
Ripper has okay what can we say in what
can we not say it seems like every day
there's a new embargo that lifts
because it's not personal the embargoes
is like 30 I mean granted the whole
entire review embargo lifted lifting of
like lots of people who aren't named
Linus
are allowed to actually post Red River
Gorge benchmarks like that's cool but
there's some there's some cool
information about thread Ripper that
we're not allowed to say yet that I'd
like you guys will be interested in so
gotta save something for coming soon gay
but yeah we'll keep an eye on that a
report as we see fit so let's move on to
our next story though which is about
Asus who is on track to release the
world's first 4k 144 Hertz
HDR display by the end of 2017 this is
very exciting this is about the rog
swift PG to 7uq g-sync HDR panel it's
got HDR 10 compatibility with support
for the PCIe not PCIe PCI p3 color space
and the peak brightness of a thousand Rd
slash and squared whatever this color
space like what the I don't even
know how to say that do you know
thousand thousand rewrite Ness is
usually MIT's I know that's all I know I
don't know if now's an RD / M thousand
radiations per square meter thousand
radiations of brightness per square
meter that's clearly what it is my
goodness
but yeah so this is pretty crazy guys
atomic measurement I feel like we've
been waiting for hyper 60 Hertz 4k for a
while and and we've had the means to do
it
I mean this is all going to be done on
this panel with a display port one point
for cable and connection but we we've
had yet to see any hardware from from
display manufacturers until now so I
believe the was it the X 27 from Acer
the really big huge deal monitor
that came out or that was announced
recently at Acer special event that
everyone like ranted and raved about
this is basically the same sort of specs
this is going to be
the the one-to-one rival of that panel
but apparently the Rises I'm sorry the
rest the Acer panel is going to be
delayed till next year 2018 whereas the
this Asus model will be available to us
this year in 2017 which is exciting so
with that what that means is that the
panels themselves the actual display
comes from the same fabs because you'll
often see this from manufacturers like
Asus doesn't manufacture panels Acer
disease to have a feb they might I'm not
positive about them but I don't think so
the the panels come from the same
locations and then the manufacturers
Acer or Asus take the panel build the
housing around it builds hardware that
goes in there possibly built like UI and
all that kind of stuff and they put that
on but the base specs of the panel and
what the panel is capable of which is
going to be like the resolution 4k the
refresh rate 144 Hertz the color depth
HDR and whatever HDR specs it matches up
with those are the same so yeah it's the
same reason why you can often find a lot
of like third-party Korean panels for a
lot cheaper that use the same sort of
Samsung displays or whatever that are
used by well-known brands just for a
fraction of the cost so it's the same
sort of thing the color space is going
to be 25% wider than srgb which is
pretty awesome uses a quantum dot
enhancement film or q def QD EF to Korea
to create deep saturated reds and greens
out of blue light and that's going to
display uh it's gonna be able to give
you more realistic images you know
darker darker scenes will look a bit
more rich and full things things of that
nature
um and yeah it's gonna be a pretty
badass monitor so stay tuned for that
there's not much else information on it
as far as pricing and exact release date
we don't know so but we've been it's a
technology that we've been waiting for
for a long time
the limiting factor now for a panel like
that is gonna be graphical horsepower
right you're gonna buy this display for
maybe a thousand bucks or more at least
a thousand bucks plus but you're going
to need the system to drive it so you're
probably gonna need at least
two gtx 1080p eyes or above in order to
even even even play with that 4k 144 FPS
sort of range so it'll be interesting
we need more graphics we need more
graphics cards yeah we need a competitor
for the 1080i so that Nvidia launches
whatever they have sitting in their back
pocket for whenever than 1080i gets
beaten yep rune for you AMD let's move
on to our next segment now which is oh
joy this is generally segments that way
that's that's displayed on Paul's hack I
have the lower thirds ready for it ready
to go beautiful you are on top of things
as always sir
so oh joy we get to talk about some
articles that unlike the the title of
the segments usually all bad news
yes all bad has no solutions right no no
no light at the end of the tunnel yep
yep so very very fun hopefully none of
you are suffering from depression
otherwise you should probably turn the
way now yeah let's talk about the first
story though on that note X 399 is
reportedly not going to support
something that you may want and that
something is bootable nvme rate there's
been a lot of emphasis on this with X
299 V Intel high-end desktop platform
for the X series yeah a lot of x-29
boards have two or even three nvme and
got two slots on them that support nvme
that you can raid and boot from that was
a huge thing we talked about a copy text
Zenith there is a vertical m dot too
rich either not know about did you
realize that your 960 Pro was tucked
away under I did not did you did you
read the packing west near the pub I
read the packing list I was on the verge
of emailing AMD me like hey I didn't get
denied no you just send me like
twenty-five hundred dollars worth of
product but there's not this SSD in
there that was were you really about to
I know I'm sitter dead at least I
considered it but no I got it sweet I
got it sweet about it
must I'm guessing that sweet was either
from someone else who got a reviewers
kit or from someone who saw someone else
who got the reviewers care it's like
it's it's it's installed on the
motherboard and as I go then I looked it
was there I so yeah I had no idea I had
you I installed the whole thing is the
question this is the question for the
reviewers out there and it's it's a
question that goes to the heart of your
of whether you're completely objective
or not
did you reformat reformat the drive yeah
I didn't use the drive you didn't use
the drive no oh you just pull it but
what did you guys anything
I used the same ad that SP 900 SSD that
I used for all of my rise and testing oh
okay so you're I completely threw it out
same all right ompletely just started
the drive broke it in half third in the
trashcan I snapped it like a stick of
gum so that so the reviewers kits that
had that drive installed on it and n60
Pro nvme SSD is samsung 960 Pro very
very very nice SSDs oh yeah like top of
the line pretty much the fast license
nvm nvm iam and that's an SSD that's it
that's out there at worst of the birch
came pre-installed with a with a Windows
10 operating system on it yeah which I
mean AMD did this they set it up so that
it was already installed with Windows 10
and that it was already set to use the
rise in the right reset power balance
yeah the rise and balance profile on our
plan or whatever right which is that way
of trying to make sure that people use
that because that is helpful to use I
don't know why I just but I was like now
I'm very formatting I don't know I don't
know another tricky I don't know whether
order the tricky stuff is on the strands
that's true I'm reformatting you yeah
and I just used to have just been a new
dream ever just been using the
high-performance power plan anyway yeah
okay um but anyway um some of you might
be upset that these needs this who
really needs any food is this the deal
breaker and if so who is this a deal
breaker for because like to people
personally I don't care I would never
use nvme SSD especially for a bootable
Drive I've always kind of implements
the idea that my boot drive should be a
single drive and not rated yeah because
it's the most important drive on my
entire system and I'd rather not have
the the the added risk of raid zero yeah
that's just me though some people might
be like look bro
I've been booting off of raid zero
arrays for centuries and it's never had
a problem and that's cool if that's your
experience you've never had an issue
then go for it
and that's who this is gonna be a deal
breaker for us this is just one of those
things that Intel could possibly
leverage you know to amp up their own
platform against the MDS because overall
AMD's kind of winning they've got more
PCIe lanes they got more cores for the
same amount of money and this is the one
thing that's like okay Intel could
probably stick it to them in some way
look we got bootable nvme but here it is
getting warmer I think they might have
shut the AC off it's okay about 20
minutes ago so I will make this quick
but um yeah clog any closing closing
words closing closing thoughts I agree
it is something that is a bit of a more
of a niche issue and although oh joy is
not supposed to have any any silver
lining or potential you know solutions
or anything it is something that might
be added in the future right so we don't
know when but it might initially
welcomed and and grant and when you look
at the Intel side of this you know they
have if you're MDOT to nvme slots and
your motherboard or write it to the PCH
then you have support for up to three
nvme devices in a raid configuration
which is what most religious mostly most
people would want as far as home users
go beyond that they have the vrock the
virtual raid on CPU which might cost
more money isn't available yet requires
an extra add-on dongle thing that you
plug into the motherboard and is only
supporting Intel nvme SSDs yes
so the support like the 1960s lavro look
side to this isn't necessarily a much
better solution on the Intel side reins
and at that so important I think to have
a view of that
hire landscape because comparisons of
that will probably affect either
company's decisions for how to implement
it in order to make it something that's
appealing to people rather than just
something that people like I'll never
use that yeah yeah all right so what's
next I think that we've got an article
from ARS technica about a company who
the tracks ISPs recently found that
almost 200 of these ISPs are imposing
data limits in the US and these are
monthly caps that are being noted not
all of them are enforced but customers
of many ISPs have to pay overage fees if
they ever go past that data cap so this
is just kind of it's like just some
interesting facts here they'll
regurgitate to you guys right now I'm
ballistic caps range from 3 gigabytes to
3 terabytes per month Comcast for one
has been steadily implementing data caps
across its territory and many other
providers have sort of followed suit you
know also just implementing their own
sort of data caps for larger ISPs a
typical plan has a 1 terabyte monthly
allotment and charges a $10 fee for each
extra 50 gigabytes that's been used over
that one terabyte allotment buying
unlimited data is sometimes an option
Comcast for example charges 50 bucks I
think for if you if you go over and you
want to add a little bit past your cap
larger providers with data caps that
made the list include AT&amp;amp;T Comcast Cox
CenturyLink Mediacom Suddenlink eggs
heed some of these I've never heard of
HughesNet the later two are the latter
two are satellite ISPs okay exceed
exceed exceed exceed okay a comment from
broadband now the company that compiled
all this data what do they had to say
for them say I said statements from
internet providers suggest the data caps
are a necessary step to combat network
congestion opponents of data caps
believe that the motivation for data
caps has more to do with recovering
declining cable
or creating a roadblock for streaming
services like Netflix so okay so if
that's the reason why these data caps
are being enforced because because ISPs
are losing money on their cable
subscriptions for example like you know
wifey sauce and I have totally averted
away from cable and just opted for a
peer Internet entertainment experience
we can get all of our content through
the internet
um so cable cutters huh so that that
might be a reason why you know our ISP
which is Time Warner might implement a
data cap is because they're losing
they're losing customers too for cable
like me and wifey sauce and they're
trying to make up for them they're
trying to you know try and try to
balance it out by implementing data caps
and charging us more if we ever go past
our caps so we need the FCC to to
preserve and protect the yep engrained
FCC means you need to take their dicks
out and just slap all the ISPs
around you know and be like look bitch
yeah the kinaho Hazel's internet the
broadband cable model I think the FCC
really needs to protect and preserve
protecting to make sure that you need to
pay for a set of 200 channels of which
you will watch three or four as long as
a armpit achieve whatever the hell his
name is
what's with the ads eaten pie as eat pie
the other thing I was gonna say next
yes as long as he's not in church lord
but he is in church I know I know
and it's the shitty thing he still needs
to be reconfirmed for 2018 hasn't
happened yet but that's like the other
thing that's not let's say that it's
saying here is you know it's either
these data caps either have to do with
making up for the declining cable
revenue these ISPs are experiencing or
it's for creating a road block for
streaming services like Netflix so in a
way I mean implementing data caps for a
streaming service or any website in
general I feel like that's kind of anti
net neutrality like by definition it's
almost like imposing certain data caps
well if data caps are imposed
for specific websites then that is an
tight net neutrality and that's
technically not legal right now right
because that hasn't been approved yet
thank God
now data caps are illegal data caps are
it's just it depends on how your
contract is laid out and that kind of
thing but isn't it like the data cap is
legal for all web sites
it's like universal right it's like your
data cap yeah it applies to any website
you go to not just like apply you have a
data cap for Netflix and you have a data
cap for like that's not kosher right now
that's not cool no it's not so you know
if what they're saying here is true then
that's that's kind of shady if they're
just data capping you for certain
services like streaming websites and
then the quote goes on to say whichever
side you believe the outcome is the same
data caps are becoming more commonplace
so the problem was that there's a lot of
internet service providers who offered
certain like they would offer deals to
people with a certain level of promised
available bandwidth mm-hmm which for a
long period of time was totally fine
because you could offer a bunch of you
could offer all your customers this much
bandwidth because realistically speaking
you know when you go back ten years
Netflix wasn't a thing people aren't
using up all their bandwidth and it's
very rare for them to use even even a
small portion of that they're using it
in small bursts but we're browsing in
that kind of thing yeah it wasn't
install video streaming became more
prevalent yep that suddenly the ISPs are
forced to be like oh this amount of
bandwidth that we sold this person that
we're promising this being is at least
authority I'm out they're paying they're
actually using now yeah like holy crap
right we're experiencing congestion and
sometimes when in the evenings and
whatever oh no all of the money that the
government gave us back in 1996 that we
said we were going to use to improve
infrastructure and we decided not to do
that just cuz it's much more valuable
for us to limit the amount of bandwidth
that people have so we can say there's
not enough bandwidth we have to charge
you more for it oh yeah
like that's all it
but anyway um it's all so it is
it really is and we'll leave it at that
he is to make your own conclusions
let's move on to our next story though
for oh joy which of course is going to
be another wretched awful article this
time about Game of Thrones and the whole
the whole series the whole thing being
hacked Game of Thrones
HP get hack packed be attacked be hugged
they got hacked with body odor no not
really but a lot of the stars of Game of
Thrones
have had their details leaked online or
threatened to have their details leaked
online as HBO hackers post a ransom note
so yeah there have been a couple
hackings recently with HBO and Game of
Thrones for example one hacker released
episode 4 which is the one that just
passed I believe in full it was up at
least a week before it ever aired on HBO
pretty much Sunday mellow episode super
mellow don't even like that much you and
I'm not worth watching at all and then
that was sort of that sort of
overshadowed this other hacker group who
who stole a script of a future Game of
Thrones episode and the group is now
back with not only the script but some
internal emails of a top executive which
does contain personal contact
information of the Game of Thrones cast
who we talking about here
hoo hoo and Game of Thrones would you
love to have their information leaks if
anyone at all no none of them Kyle I
respect people's privacy and I wouldn't
share that type of information that is a
 you're lying to your fans
you're lying to your fans you're lying
to me and I don't appreciate it Paul we
we are drinking the reason why we drink
on this show is so we don't have to
cover up lies it's as hot like
worth so some kind of serious bubbles to
the surface but okay here's here's whose
details weren't really at the very least
Peter Dinklage which I that's who I
would vote for
first off because I would call him
immediately and just want to have a chat
with him
Lena Headey which is a Searcy
fantabulous actress shame shame shame
shame very shameful actress she should
all she didn't have all the tomatoes
through her face saying shame on the
people who shared the stuff anyway maybe
a client Amelia clarity which is a
Denarius Targaryen don't want that at
all
I hope she's got a new phone already I I
would hope so otherwise I will be after
her digits so this appears to be the
hackers or the people who have this
information have some sort of ransom or
some sort of ongoing thing that they're
trying to a stork from HBO right so the
reason why none of this stuff was
initially suddenly available but it sort
of started to the creep out is they're
trying to get they're trying to make
money off of this stuff that they settle
they're trying to make money and I mean
it's all for ransom right there's a
ransom note that they've included which
I'll read some some quotes from that
soon enough but it doesn't really say
how much they're demanding that was not
listed what the dollar amount is I would
imagine it's a lot but but but here it's
kind of interesting this is what the
ransom note says this is what the
hackers wrote to the execs at HBO
they said it's a game for us money isn't
our main purpose okay so they're calling
them there they're cleaning themselves
to be white hats which is a term that
I'm not familiar with very much white
hats oh and then in the hacking world
this hats white hat me like white night
oh my white hat is supposed to be a good
hacker I see someone who hacks like a
Robin Hood hacker yeah someone who ha ha
ha ha finds an exploit or something like
that and then instead of sharing it with
the entire dark web they go to that
company and say hey I found this
vulnerability on your website here it is
right and then sometimes the company
will pay them or whatever but that's
white hat that's supposed to be good
there's gray hat which means
a little of both and there's then this
black hat which is hackers who are
hacking for personal gain or that kind
of thing I I still feel like ladies HBO
is not gonna be like oh they claim to be
white hats it's all gravy like this is
still I feel like white hacking
white hat usually doesn't involve like
give us money like I just yeah yeah yeah
like that's we're like we're dangling us
information on on a straight gray hat
gray hat would be fair like a gray hat
at the very least right nothing about
what they're doing here seems white hat
related and they're saying the hackers
have claimed HBO HBO is their 17th
target and only three have refused to
pay in the past I quote leakage will be
your worst nightmare
the note threatens so make a wise
decision this is verbatim what the note
says so make a wise decision they have
threatened to dump more videos of future
shows with their with their logo HBO is
falling the video ultimatum ends with an
image of Game of Thrones night King the
white Walker assume with his arms raised
with the word standing in one hand and
falling in the other so it's kind of
like there it's like a threat it's like
poignant how how do you want to approach
this HBO we just hacked you to call your
information and we even sent you a cool
fun mean picture of the white walk of a
king white Walker saying choose your
fate do you want to pay us and be cool
or do you want to not pay us and get
Burt great am I reading that right it
seems like what they're doing but yeah
they're totally white padding it we
don't want to endanger HBO's in
situation nor cause it to lose its
reputation we want to be your partner in
a tiny part of HBO's huge income we want
to be your partner in reelin and all the
dough that like you owe us money because
we were able to hack
database and infrastructure so I mean ed
sucks
you know HP I mean HBO and the cast of
Game of Thrones everyone involved is
seeing tremendous success from the show
that's that's unquestionable but you
know life has a way of you up
and dicking you over according to these
crazy articles they've got some that's
some to handle so best of luck to
the Game of Thrones cast I hope that we
don't see any you know Peter Dinklage
nudes on right at anytime soon not what
I'm into Emilia Clarke I mean you know
 happens I mean you know whatever if
that happens it is what is this
slightest hopefully not no it's totally
this delicious no no one's nude should
be leaked let the record show Peter
Dinklage is such an awesome name
Yeah right it's like penis penis e penis
ding clear means penis penis ding and
Dinklage sounds like the dangle enos of
a penis yeah yeah the Dinklage that
penis had quite a bit of Dinklage how is
your Peter Dinklage doing today
oh my English is minimal today 60%
exactly but oh is it 100% Peter all
right it's like if you if you're gonna
make a stage name make it two names you
both mean penis and some to some extent
and you'll get hired by all the big yes
yes chaos is a ladder all right all
right let's move on to fit my BC doozy
pin my penis I mean been on PC good lord
this first one comes from Chris Chris
for the 37 seven minutes 37 37 7 3770k
4.7 gigahertz we've got what else a gtx
770 at 1306 at 250 gig Evo sin
Samsung you know I guess for OS 16 gigs
of g.skill memory at 1600 speed and the
Sound Blaster titanium HD SIM card so
we're looking at meteor 3 memory we're
looking at several noctua fans I wonder
if they're Chinese or Taiwan also seems
to be a combination of that two of these
are the industrial ones right it's black
those look like some - special edition
ones we also have water-cooled CPU
levels GPU both with all-in-one units
yeah Hugh I like the addition of the
extra heat sinks here for the memory on
the back of the 770 overall I don't know
I feel like this isn't the greatest
camera that the pictures are being taken
with right that that takes away from it
I think cables and fans are the things
that don't match the rest of yelled as
well as they could
fans definitely stand out I mean as not
to offend do you have to take it with
the like balance of like alright well
then act to a fans I mean even if it was
like the black red and brown of the nock
to us I'd be cool with that the swap all
swapped the beige not to of fans with
more of these industrial fans and that
would blend in a bit more yeah okay
potentially that's reasonable or even
the other way just you know get rid of
the industrial ones and use more of the
brown ones that I mean that could work
too yeah I will say we're also dealing
with a pretty decent amount of video
card sag here especially since you have
the sound card down here to compare it
to which actually needs to be moving
doesn't the sound cards appear to have
negative sag it's it's weird if it's
like an optical illusion because of the
GPU side I'm working really is going up
I'm seeing negative sag here oh because
look at how the other molex cable
I think the molex cables pulling it up a
bit
straightening those that would balance
things out of it and then of course we
have the ketchup and mustard cables on
the CPU issue and the power supply issue
here and that yellow sticker on your
rear i/o that clearly no no that yellow
sticker if you go all the way and you
swap out the neck to a fans and you
really try to make things look look
pretty than definitely remove those
stickers too yeah yeah so obviously you
got a very nice system here if you're
looking at aesthetics there's some stuff
you can do hopefully our suggestions
have helped NEETs move on to tell a lot
of dumb uh he can't find his motherboard
he's got 600 okay 16 gigs of ram and 850
Evo and a 1070 founders Edition a very
nice little compact system here is what
looks to be the Nano s from freckle
design which is a micro ATX chassis and
you've managed to fit a massive nock to
a cooler in there which props to you
Sarah for doing so
damn um I think overall this is a really
clean looking system I think probably
just because the components look so big
inside of the chassis but you almost
don't even see any cables yeah which is
apparently a good thing if you want to
clean things up or just make it look a
little bit more unique I guess you could
maybe spray-paint the fans I mean you
would only have to spray paint the
outside of the fans I don't think the
blades are very visible from any old
angle not if you spray paint the fans
either black or maybe even the same
shade of green as the GeForce GTX
branding on the founders edition there
that would look pretty good
oh yeah be fun to be different um I kind
of like that sticker on the power supply
it's one good thing that I've mentioned
about the the new RM series from course
there's the the stickers look pretty
nice they're very neutral yeah very
neutral kind of sporty looking so I
don't mind those at all
I mean Franklin does a good job of
having a nice black and white theme out
of the box with their cases you've
already got the white blades on those GP
fans
I believe the GPS so maybe if you Wanda
maybe if you want to spray paint those
Noctua fans the same sort of scheme as
the fractal fans that'd be kind of cool
yeah right I mean black on the outside
of the frame and then white on the
blades that will look pretty sweet
actually and you'd still get the same
performance of Noctua and
only other thing I would suggest I mean
if you really wanted to go all that
would be a sleeve to kit of cables more
your power supply which he has lots of
independent cable sleepers who do that
for that you just have to tell them what
kind of brand of power supply you have
indeed that would look nice granted
you're only gonna see the small bits of
it and when you actually install it the
parts at the bottom at the power supply
and then maybe a little bit of the 24
pin and you're right oh so worth it yeah
it's but overall a very clean build and
it looks pretty cool with the complete
lack of motherboard indeed that's
visible next up we've got Gabriel with
an i3 6100 a nice use h1 10m our
motherboard and gigabyte rx 470 and a
one terabyte hard drive with a 120
gigabyte SSD a very nice little budget
build I do say so myself and cable
management looks super clean I mean with
what you have to work with with with a
budget case like this and a ketchup and
mustard budget power supply this is one
of the cleanest cable management jobs I
have seen on Pitt my PC with a system of
this price range I will say that you've
done outstanding job here and still it
somehow manages to look budget because
they are ketchup and mustard so um I
don't know how much more room you have
back there
I really don't doesn't look like much
but if you could find a way to get some
black sleeve cables on there it would
clean up the look quite a bit or maybe
just swap out the power supply for
something that comes natively with black
cables so you don't have this sort of
ketchup and mustard you know red and
yellow scheme going on of course there
are bigger fish to fry here I mean
you've got a pretty modest system with
an RX 470 in the i3 you could stand to
upgrade those components as well and you
know I guess if you have the money
upgrade the whole system upgrade the
platform if you were looking to get into
maybe you know quad HD gaming or
something like that maybe ultra wide not
not to say that the system's better
anything it's going to be
a 1080p champ regardless but I don't
know it's super clean I don't know what
do you think Paul yeah I mean I agree
with Kyle you're gonna want to upgrade
the core component components before you
invest too much and everything else yeah
your case is just fine your power supply
could use an upgrade at some point in
the future but it's getting the job done
as well and again I'd rather update
these core components hang on in that
case though and your cable management
skills are very nice I think they would
be better appreciated if you had a case
that had better sleeping you know just
even all-black cables or something like
that but a nice clean build overall and
hang on to that case because it's got a
nice feel a lot of space in there yeah
that's yeah I'm to work with definitely
consider Rison I would say because right
now with the 6100 I think that's a
dual-core and if you're trying to you
know step it up to maybe some more
triple-a gaming if higher settings than
a quad-core I think would be a good move
I think in 2017 that's not a lot to ask
to get a quad-core for a decent price
you can even go with like a you know
horizon 3 processor or even rise in five
if you can muster muster the price point
there yeah 6100 is a dual-core with
hyper-threading yeah so I mean you've
got four threads that's that's good
but still I know a lot of games lot of
triple-a titles that will suffer even
from having a dual-core hyper-threaded
CPU in there so depending on your needs
but overall I mean this this what five
to $700 system looks more well
maintained and clean than many $1500
rigs that we've seen on my PC so good
job on you for that
thanks very much Gabriel let's move on
to our next guy molten fire Walton fire
on via with a little suspect but we've
got some picture here she tells the
story I mean looks like a lot of cabling
going around looks like you've got a
fractal is that a frankly as a fractal
case might be a core 1,000 or some
1,100 1,100 yeah 1,300 whatever I don't
know I don't know what the names
are but uh okay
cables are everywhere but it's hard to
make the cables look super nice when you
have that power supply with ketchup and
mustard and also very limited back space
behind the motherboard tray so I'm not
gonna fault you for that it looks like
so used to be a core 2300 his oh yeah oh
the 2300 okay that think cool Chuck
doesn't it look like the top fans are
intake yeah so that's okay as long as
you have a dust filter otherwise it
might get pretty dusty in your case you
might want to consider swapping those
two exhaust just so that you don't have
as much dust buildup inside your chassis
unless you're totally cool with cleaning
it like once a month or once every other
month then that's totally fine but
generally you don't get a dust filter at
the top of your case because it's
designed generally for exhaust that's by
design so you might want to flip those
yeah I mean it it actually it looks like
all of your fans in this case are said
to exhaust I don't know about intake Oh
intake sorry yeah right to intake so I
don't care how this radiator is set up
but definitely the top right and the
front saw to brighter air intake yeah so
I'm not exactly sure
I mean if temps are good doing well for
you then then I'm all for it but you
know you don't want too much dust
buildup at least you got a dust filter
I'm sure at the front with that case but
I'm not sure about the top unless you've
added one yourself everything else looks
you know cable management could be
tidied up a bit here and there
well you don't have much potential with
us in this case if I was you practically
speaking leave these two front to it and
take flip the top two to exhaust and
make this rear and intake as well
that'll give you fresh air going over
your CPU liquid cooler exhaust at the
top but yeah it should be pushing it
and then beyond that your cable
management is not that great it could
use some tidying up and you're just
you've just got a fractal power supply
that's not that great as far as the
cable cables are usually and you don't
have room for incisions so swapping that
Paris flight could be an option but
honestly kind of like one of the other
builds we looked at earlier in this one
you might be more interested in
upgrading your core components before
you do something like that but yeah I
agree with everything you said could at
least use a rewiring job I feel like
indeed that would help a lot give some
zip ties I think you very much molten
fire next one more lastly we've got Nick
Nova the core i5 6600 K GTX 970 for the
wind from EVGA 16 gigs of DDR 4 Corsair
and AZ 170 I mother board from Asus with
an H 100 i cooling down that I 5
looks like we were in a zoo we evolved
it's the pro gaming z170 i motherboard
z170 I'm with oh yeah alright so right
Nick the first thing you're gonna want
to do here because you have a white case
you have a graphics card with a blue
accent you're gonna want to look at my
video which is very specifically on this
motherboard and how to make it look good
which is to remove that pro gaming logo
from it and I also painted the heatsinks
on the top as well to remove the red
accents I feel like that would do a lot
in this build actually spray paint it
white just because the red is only on
the motherboard there granada' you've
got the corsair logo as well here I'm
not sure if you can change that around
at all
yeah when and then maybe something with
this cabling here and the lower-left
that might yeah look while the spray
paint modifications that you'd want to
do are very simple yeah granted they
would require you to uninstall the
motherboard completely so as long as
you're willing to put in some extra work
in a few hours of labor I feel like the
the end results would be devastatingly
more awesome so
also I'm not exactly sure why you
decided to keep the the fantex cover
over your graphics card I feel like that
could easily be removed I don't think it
really affects performance much but it
at least shows off your card a bit more
unless you're just trying to hide the
the PCIe cables and that make sense
cabling seems pretty fair for what
you're given here in this little case I
feel like obviously an extension kit
maybe with some White's leaving would
look really really nice especially if
you did the basic modifications that
Paul suggested and I was showing my
video right now Paul will demonstrate
with his own it's not playing back very
well for some reason of his own
experiences I had the heat gun off the
pro-gaming logo on this thing and then I
did some spray-painting on stuff it was
just a sticker that was on there or was
it a bad it's like a badge with a metal
piece on the back but actually when you
take it off the piece its underneath
doesn't look bad at all um which was
cool and now chrome is completely locked
up hold on
nice good job chrome I really need to
upgrade that system with like a 7 whoa
more RAM
yeah you should what the I don't know
what just happened
wait there's a little weird but anyway
that could probably help this system out
I would say other than that the cam
management isn't terrible um you could
just use a facelift and we essentially
might look nice here yeah and you've got
plenty of room underneath that power
supply shroud you've got a basement
there so you could probably work with it
and you've already got the white accents
I really like the Corsair fans that
you've added with the white rings I
think that's a nice touch yeah white
extensions would just complement that
all the more and make it just kind of
give it a more premium feel so but yeah
that's pretty much it for a pin my pcs
thank you very much everyone who
submitted their rigs if you didn't
happen to get called or
chosen for this week there's always an
opportunity for next time
so bear that in mind and that's pretty
much gonna do it from I have the show
apart from some questions some donations
that you guys put out a donation let's
read those Rock nerve and so we had one
that came in at the end of my half but
we didn't catch it so sorry about that
from Adam Moore who donated $5 and you
said I just ordered my friend some parts
for a 1063 gig and rise in three twelve
hundred build what are your thoughts on
this combination let's pretty salt I
think that's an excellent combination
yeah I think 1066 gig is a nice bump up
from the 1063 gig if you can find it but
the prices for those tend to get
outrageous pretty quickly so 1063 gig is
perfectly good and happy pairing with
that CPU yeah for sure I just did a rise
in three 1200 build with a 1050 ti4 gig
and like did a bunch of 1080 gaming with
it and it was it performed really well
like it's a really good job so yeah I
think it's a good combo yep I think
that's actually the the graphics card
that I like the highest end graphics
card that I recommended pairing with
horizon 3 CPU was the GTX 1060 because
as soon as you get into the ballpark of
the gtx 1070 or beyond you start to
running into some serious bottlenecking
with rising 3 it's a big jump to go from
10 60 up to 10 say today's so yeah so
you did a good job with your friend
there good job Adam
next up we've got Paul you have a
donation quirt Byron I have dollar
donation from court are you going to use
the baby oil I sent you on stream or is
that for behind closed doors I haven't
checked my P o box in it no we had a
baby oil already with our faces on and
everything oh yeah it was since we have
it it we're still two bottles it just in
my might in my window no Silver's it's
very visible so if anyone like all my
neighbors who walk by like walk by our
house every day they look up to my
window and they just see two bottles of
baby oil with our faces on it so you
would be very canal but it's not here
it's Beckett comes back in my house I'll
have to bring it here
I always thought it'd be fun like like
sell suggestion to do like a thumb
wrestling match with with maybe you go
oh yeah maybe have like I'm not a
slippery hire like a professional mc2 to
nari the whole thing and you get Terry
Crews I bet he'd be good for that yeah
Terry Crews would totally do that
sweet yep thank you very much shakes
burn does Joe know I bucks what's up
guys we meet again lol which thread
ripper will you all be benching first
the 1920 X or the 1958 which X 3 I am
motherboard so far is your current
favorite so first on the only x99 board
I've used the zenith extreme from Asus
Singh it's super nice and I also 550
freaking dollars is it really that much
yeah oh thanks for any they start it
through mail started the cheapest
asrock is 330 or 340 or something like
that
wow they're really expensive yeah and
then then like yeah this like sex you
9334 the cheapest asrock 384 the next
cheapest msi and then everything else is
between 3 380 and 500 bucks for what's
available at lunch it's pretty it's
pretty and it looks like X 299 starts at
250 ish to it you can get extra 99
there's already two hundred different
motherboards available for X 299 200
different one hundred according to an
article I read earlier there's already a
 ton of motherboards for XNA night
Lord so yeah there's gonna be $250 X 399
motherboards just that right now it
looks like that for right now X to $2.99
on intel side is around starting it
around 250 um whereas like Paul said 350
for X 399 which is pretty insane so
again that asus motherboard the zenith
extreme is freakin awesome
yes I really really like the board
really expensive yeah I'm Steve I can
say I've benchmarked the 1950 X I'll be
giving a video on that at launch YouTube
I'm also going to be doing a follow-up
video that's more more focused on the
night
20 X I will not be doing a follow-up
video the week of lunch because I am a
slacker oh I'm trying I'm trying to get
a 1920 X video pretty pretty quick as
well be more badass but we'll see how
things go later tonight and tomorrow and
the day after it's a lot of stuff still
to do monkey dog 24 the ten dollars many
bucks but a 7700 K about a month ago
worth trying to hit five gigahertz or
just settle at 4.8 with less effort I'm
using the Kraken X 62 AIO bro
you can hit a 5 gigahertz overclock
stabili as long as you don't have a
complete junk CPU all of the silicon
water I don't know you should be able to
hit 5 gigahertz with the next 16 tens on
your processor eveson just have another
k that is that is like I thought point 9
I thought was good at 4.9 I was like man
it can't hit 5 that's okay I'm good at
4.9 tried it again in the summer when
temperatures were 5 or 10 degrees hotter
it's completely instability just not
completely not completely failed still
worked just enough weight and
instability to where I was like alright
4.8 4.8 for me like when I'm
overclocking it's all about trying to be
like alright what can I get it up to all
right it was a little finicky there what
can I get it to work so no it's never
gonna have a problem and 4.8 is probably
where you want to be with the 77 ok for
that yeah unless your deal inning or
something like that I mean you could
easily hit 5 you it really just depends
on the CPU you get yeah when it comes to
1 to 300 megahertz of what you're trying
to achieve it is just based on what CPU
you get so just play around with it
and good luck El Jefe reviews $5 cows
look with pin my PC potato Edition oh
yeah bro that's I should do that soon I
completely forgot about that thank you
for reminding me a potato Edition would
be great the the problem with doing like
a special edition of hit my PC is that
like prompts a lot of trolls to go out
and seek specific pictures of rigs that
pertain to that category whether said if
I do there's no Edition subreddits where
there's just a treasure trove of
yeah like shitty battlestations and so
right that yeah so that are all gonna be
used I like to make it more relatable
and like something like a you know just
so that everyone can continue you have
to Google Image Search everything that's
sent to you to make I know posted I know
all that baby child put the harm
congratulation on the new studio man
looks a grade would you be down to have
a small fan zone like Rekha if I sent a
picture of my peepee would you put it up
on the spray in a corner for all of
YouTube to see what the that I just
read holy I know that's to send you
a pic dick pic this is a quarter my fix
am i that kind of YouTube channel that
just seems kosher with putting up a
picture of some random fancy don't
answer my question
TV as much as I appreciate all of your
donations and all of your contributions
to the channel for both me and Paul over
the last few months and years I love you
so much I don't think I'm gonna put a
picture of your dick on my wall
just just sames putting that out there
no I mean we're friends and all I
wouldn't even put a picture of Paul's
dick how about that like the guy that I
stream with that I've known for like
years and years he's practically my
brother from another mother I would look
if you came to me tomorrow Paul we're
like gal I just got these head shots
like head shots of my dick would you
want to throw them up on your wall like
the background of awesome heart I'd be
like you dude
I mean I'll put them in my bedroom yeah
but not you haven't seen the pictures
hit can't you're right
you know you're right cold judgments
you're right maybe you'll just be like
that is a glorious do you that is a
glory you have these in a larger size
the most can you see blown up you can't
read it it's it's larger than it needs
to be ready just say good is there any
room for everything
knowing
detail would be well thank you theity
for the thought at the very least in the
donation Michael Brooks for the 20 bucks
building my first PC in 15 years rising
1600 GT X 1080 16 gigs 3200 speed picks
coming soon monitor shopping asus mg279q
or PG 2 7 a cute
I want 140 feet 144 P and IPS what I've
been missing it a lot by not going
g-sync Kyle here's money this time thank
you very much Michael first off I
appreciate it
I think the bill that you're going with
is pretty solid arisin 1600 with a gtx
1080 I think that's pretty fair yeah um
as far as monitors go you want 1440p and
IPS I don't go off the off the top of my
head what the difference is between the
two asus models you have listed here
would you be missing a lot by not going
to gsync yes you would
if you're buying a GTX 1080 you should
you should consider investing in and
work out the variable refreshing monitor
it's really really really worth it it's
amazing it's so um I don't know what the
price difference is between these good
people oh really what wow what is this
so the asus mg279q and the Aces PG - 7
AQ both 27-inch both ok alright little
they're different resolutions
27-inch 1440 or 27-inch 2160 or 4k the
1440 is 144 hurts and is $540 goat the
2k but does not include Jesus oh jeez
oh no no no get it 2 kg Singh yeah - kg
sink nicer sweet spicy $930 that's too
much presuming this you don't need
relatively accurate this was 14 months
ago this might not be accurate 4k will
be wasted on you
I guess yeah go for a 1440 G sink panel
in the five to $700 range you should be
able to find that I believe and that
would be yeah what I would recommend
Acer has some pretty competitive options
there as does Asus I'm sure Scott
Dilbeck six dollars and sixty cents what
are we going to get a tour video of the
new place and did you guys enjoy sushi
last week
hell yeah weeks ago it's two months ago
and yes we enjoyed it very much good um
studio tour is coming soon it's been
delayed a little bit because I'm
currently waiting on here here's the
thing when I was at my grandparents
place operating out of there I felt like
I had a surplus of hardware I had way
more keyboards way more monitors way
more everything than I needed and now
that I'm in this space that's literally
triple maybe quadruple times the amount
of space I feel like I've experiencing a
deficit of hardware for the very first
time of stuff I don't have enough
monitors all of a sudden I don't have
enough keyboards and so before I give
you guys the full-blown studio tour I
kind of want to make it presentable and
in such a way where you guys sort of get
an idea of what its gonna look like in
the end so I'm currently working with a
lot of vendors like Asus Corsair fully
which is a company that does like the
up-and-down electric tables oh I'm
working with a lot of them right now to
sort of populate this space so that it
looks a bit more presentable for when I
finally do that studio tour it should be
pretty epic when it finally size around
you can easily take advantage of your
the fact that you have new space in
general right now and do like a like
first look studio tour yeah like I
barely got moved in and here's what
we're working with
true and then a month later here's what
I've done with the studio now with all
this new awesome stuff in it this is a
good point so can I tell you so perhaps
you can spend like an hour and walk
around here with a camera and pointed it
stuff and people we will be very
interested I know I know which say you
should do that no you're right you're
right
and I am strongly considering that
because the more I am in contact with
these various vendors the the more I'm
realizing like oh it's gonna take them
like time way longer to
send me those products than I thought so
perhaps you might get you guys might get
a sneak peek earlier than you might be
expecting way that's a li p21 does Ellis
so Oh cow quick question what is your
opinion on the EVGA DG eighty seven I
want to do a case womp blending on that
one love your videos keep it up I never
actually built in that one but I will
say Dimitri unfortunately in one of his
videos talking about the cases of 2016
was like EVGA why does your case look
like a rear projection television and
that's all I can see now I do remember
that I do not saw him to say with the
DG's that's all we got Tilly building it
ourselves we have no other comment
Edward Creek ten dollars my wife says I
look like Paul I take that as a
compliment well there is a better photo
on my Twitter post under this week's pin
my PC thank you both for the great
content keep it up why thank you Edward
I hope you continue to look like Paul
yeah in many years so I continue to
decompose just in sixty three five
dollars I have the choice between an
asus rog Strix be 350 and asus primed x
370 pro which would you choose to pair
with an r5 1600 i'd go with the cheaper
Strix be 350 motherboard um which i
would assume is cheaper that depends
yeah if you're talking about paying for
either one and a 30 40 $50 difference
then you have the B 350 but even if it
was going for multi-gpu like an r5 1600
is not really going to keep up with that
unless your planned upgrades assume
right if if the price difference is an
issue completely agree with Kyle goes to
be 350
if someone's saying like here choose
between these two motherboards then get
the x3 7 oh yeah if you if you get it
for free it's more capable but you can
do more things of course
when does that happen but yes your us
but like Cal said you know you might not
take advantage of all those things so
it's might not be worth paying extra
money yeah but there you go that but
money wasn't listed here as part I know
I'm just saying I understand unless
you're putting two GPUs in there me PC
thirty bucks thank you following since
episode 35 inch Wow
finally catching a live show here's
something for the two of you to split
keep it up thank you very much Judy you
have any money that's awesome
thanks Judy that's awesome that you've
been watching for that long yeah it's
great it's also crazy that we're doing
it's a hundred and fifteen episodes
right now that's weeks crazy so many
weeks that's almost 100 weeks steelbook
zero seven for the 500 PHP not PCP I
love your vids Kyle your white belt and
December PC inspired me to build my new
rig awesome
question will a nine Santa Mesa well a
GTX oh there you go
well a GTX 970 bottleneck arise in 1600
no by the way in case you're wondering
that's 500 Philippine Peso
about 10 USD well I thank you very much
sir I just feel about that um no I don't
think your your your GTX 970 will
bottleneck a risin 5 1600 very much
they're very capable CPUs these are not
the same sort of you know FM 2 socket
CPUs and shits that we've seen from AMD
in the past I think you're pretty good
with a 970 yeah you should be fine you
should be totally fine
what are cool fool for the 10 bucks
which board would you choose for thread
record I was looking at Asus going to
get the 16 core CPU if you're going for
the 16 core you're willing to spend a
bit more go for the zenith x3 and zenith
extreme it's a beautiful or this $550
$500 I'm expecting there to be more
boards in the 250 to $350 range and it
maybe come out around or after lon
that's true might be a little bit more
reasonable because honestly you're
getting a lot of cool stuff with that
board but you're not getting a lot of
extra performance you're true it's not
necessarily gonna overclock it really a
heck of a lot better or anything like
that at that point look at the
individual features that each board
manufacturer offers because some of them
might be total fluff and useless to you
others you might really see a value in
and just base it on your own needs just
have RGB LEDs on the analog
else for the sound though which is kind
of fun which I posted an Instagram I did
an Instagram post on that when after and
posted without knowing us and a couple
comments for like dude I'll just post
and I'll look at yours and I was like
clearly I need to follow Paul's
Instagram comparing more closely you
should I had no idea it was very funny
and I looks like almost the exact same
picture and stuff it's funny because I
had actually taken that picture a day or
two before yeah and then I remembered I
say oh yeah yeah sitting there running
benchmark since I posted it yeah but uh
cool yeah grace Black Raven 0 1 3 5 mm
Ellison I currently have an i7 6850 at
4.6 gigahertz is there any reason to
upgrade to X 299 or X 399 for gaining
new I dunno soo if I 1650 dude you're
you're smooth sailing man especially if
you're not gonna get any higher
frequency than you already at with
either of those platforms yep and gaming
is more about the frequency right then
it is about anything else and you've
already got six scores with 6850 so good
to make any sort of noticeable
difference you're gonna have to upgrade
your GPU long before your cpu sublime
$10 heyo finally catching a livestream
awesome question are you guys open to
helping fans part out Bill's got an idea
for a multi-function beast and would
love help so I can learn honestly dude
it's one of those things where so many
people ask us all the time like 24/7 you
wouldn't even believe like how often we
get asked like hey can you check in my
parts list hey this is look good to you
where it's like I physically cannot look
that's a full-time job or at least a
part-time job that I have to hire
someone to check on all that stuff
without missing out or sacrificing all
the other work that I'm doing behind the
scenes because it's a lot like there are
a lot of people asking us to review
their parts lists that we just don't
have time as much as I would love to
like every time I see it it's it's like
one of those like bittersweet like oh my
god love to like check it out and
actually give you some like meaningful
feedback but at the same time there are
just so many requests that I have to I
guess I both of us we have to sort of
prioritize you know I mean there's a
thread Ripper launch on
way but we have to like 10 - we can't ya
be giving you guys advice on every
single parts list that you guys throw
our way I do I do a video at the
beginning of every month where I part
out systems and I say here's parts lists
and people ask me questions and I do
straw poll and people can give me
feedback on what they want me to do
granted that might not be exactly the
parts list that you're looking for but
but it's night ring I try to make them
reasonable and and and very four months
two months so might be good starting off
points relevant to possible
math you see keratin 5 domination no
moments so make it Matthew Luke $5 Paula
you should electrocute that piece of
wood for your media PC electrocute it I
don't want it to start a fire we're in
California we never were that that's
really dense
woman I'm worried that I'm gonna wear
out my tools working on Jack Nelson five
Australian I would assume I think so I
hope to use the evolved shift for my
next build but I'm concerned about
thermals Kyle what's your experience
with temps near new htpc I have yet to
hook it up to an actual monitor and and
and and check the temps on it but there
will very likely be a follow-up video to
the HTPC refresh that all that stuff
will be covered including like what it's
like to actually put a gtx 1080i inside
of the ship decks or actually it's the
shift which is he which is saying even
more because it's slightly more
constrained and perhaps a tad more
thermally limited but more of that later
Matthews he trained again for the five
dollars just bought risin five or I'm
sorry rise in 1950 X so thread Ripper
wait how did he do that
with a GPS Oh pre-ordered okay GT X 1080
going to kill frames in stream good idea
yeah yet I mean you probably have way
way way way way more than you ggtort CPU
horsepower than you need for all that
but um yeah the nice thing about the
1950 X is the frequencies are very nice
and it does have I'm
there's this stuff we're not supposed to
talk about it's got good stuff for
making sure that if you're not using all
the cores that it's running at a higher
frequency so gaming performance has been
pretty good yeah so I think you've got a
good solution there especially if you're
looking for something that can handle
both the gaming and streaming yep max
finally max mikheev 5 bucks does a 560 X
from AMD Strix pair well with a phenom
ii x4 98 as it's a slightly older
recommendation and I'm not as fresh with
that knowledge yeah I may be I don't
think you would be severely but when I
have phenom ii x4 980 is getting pretty
outdated at this point so um I might
consider horizon 3 or keeping up upgrade
options in mind I would say Rison 3 is
probably a fair pairing with a with an
RX 560 and yeah and the Rison 3
outperforms that phenom 2 quite a bit so
I feel like you're a bit o peed with
your graphics resolution at the moment
and then finally Joel shall see that
$5.00 hey guys kitchen wife's came again
and had to remind you that Aussie money
is dollar really lose yeah dollar e dues
why thank you very much for the five
dollar reduced Joe appreciate sir

words in the circle 20-amp pint glass
and then I know that's but not least
we've got one for Vicky Vicky picking up
a stay positive tri-blend shirt thank
you guys and gals so much for tuning in
for this episode of awesome hardware we
wouldn't be here without you so we
really appreciate you guys tuning in
every week and we will be here yet again
on another Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time right here on twitch TV slash
awesome hardware or a respective YouTube
channels pulse hardware and pin plates
but yeah thank you guys so much we'll
see you guys later
like why if you like the videos I think
