first V 270 board on the channel and by
proxy going over all of the new features
that come with Intel z2 70 chipset
that's right
all two of them this is the MSI V 270
gaming m7 which as you can see sports
built-in customizable RGB light then
again so does this coffee mug holder but
rest assured there are bigger features
than dancing LEDs afoot so let's see
what this new board and chipsets have to
offer as most of you guys know z2 70
supports until ATIS seventh gen KB like
processors which support the LGA 1151
socket meaning this board is backwards
compatible with skylight CPUs if you
happen to only be interested in
upgrading your chipset one of the main
draws of the 270's that it packs for
more PCIe gen3 lanes than v 170 giving
you 24 lanes via the chipset alone
factor in the 16 lanes available through
the cpu and you've got 40 PCIe lanes at
your disposal for things like graphics
cards of course and storage devices this
is good news for heavy storage users
since ports no longer have to share
lanes as readily as they did on z170
meaning more connections on the
motherboard can be utilized
simultaneously it's no surprise then
that we find generous storage options on
the m7 including a uq connector and
three m2 nvme SSD slots with raid zero
support all natively controlled by the
chipset one of the slots even includes a
metallic shield with thermal padding
underneath to help reduce heat and
thermal throttling which can be an issue
for certain m2 SSDs when they become
available this is also where you could
slot in an Intel obtain drive to be used
as a cache for super fast access time as
of now this high-speed caching feature
is only supported by V 270 though most
modern ship sets will allow opting to be
used at a regular storage device
staggered about the m2 connectors is a
trio of reinforced PCIe by 16 slots
which support 2-way SLI and 3-way
crossfire and apart from four dimm slots
supporting up to 64 gigs of DDR 4 at
4,000 megahertz overclock you get six
SATA six ports a pair of USB 2 and 3.0
headers and another welcome addition
found on select c 270 boards a USB 3.1
header for chasis that are fitted with
front panel USB type-c granted there
aren't many right now but with onboard
integration hopefully we'll start to see
more cases ships this year with our new
favorite reversible port next of the
surface mounted power and reset you'll
find an overclocking knob with
incremental levels of aggressiveness for
automatically increasing the voltage and
frequency of your CPU with the system
powered off I slipped a dial somewhere
on the uppity scale and upon my next
boot my 7700 K was clocked at a stable 5
gigahertz at 1.3 a 2 volts if you find
the knob inconvenience users have the
option to auto overclock from within the
BIOS as well which is just as quick and
easy some other onboard mentions
included debug LED 6 PWM fan headers and
a 4 pin RGB header for 50/50 LED strips
that can be controlled in the MSI gaming
app as you might have guessed this also
controls the onboard LEDs with a number
of effects to choose from and don't
worry you can disable them entirely if
you like color accuracy of the LEDs is
spot-on with certain colors and way off
with others so it's too bad the desktop
app only lets you choose between 7
preset colors when the lights are off
however I do appreciate the m7s color
neutrality for a stealthy subdued
appearance MSI's mystic light app lets
you play RGB God from your smartphone or
tablet so the app wasn't finding my PC
for some reasons though I couldn't try
it out firsthand on the bright side
MSI's apps support a growing list of
third-party RGB products that can be
synced in harmony for a cohesive color
scheme circling back to the hardware
plenty of connectivity options lined the
rear i/o
including a ps2 port 3 USB 2 ports one
supporting BIOS flash back a clear CMOS
button display port an HDMI killer
Ethernet LAN 2 USB 3.1 gen2 USB 3.1 gen2
one of which is using a type C connector
s/pdif out and eight channel audio
powered by an isolated audio boost sound
ship after spending about a week with
the gaming m7 after all it was the board
I used for my 7700 K review my
impressions of it are mostly positive
due to the solid build quality and
plethora of storage options the board
has no issues taking a 7700 K to 5
gigahertz assuming your chip isn't a
silicon dud and I'm always a sucker for
those little onboard touches like
surface mounted
power and now USB 3.1 like most
motherboard manufacturers though the
software and LED color accuracy have
much room for improvement also at around
250 bucks MSRP there are definitely
cheaper z2 70 motherboards out there so
if you don't think you'll be using most
of these features I would suggest
looking at MSI's gaming m5 model or at
least some of the other entry-level
offerings from other manufacturers
otherwise this board brings a lot to the
table that should satisfy the needs of
most modern-day enthusiasts but that is
going to do it for this first looks guys
feel free to share your thoughts on the
board in the comments below and also let
me know if there's V 270 board out there
that you currently have your eye on also
feel free to toss me a like on the video
if you enjoyed it as always I'm Talib
itwith thank you guys for watching
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and I will see y'all in the next
