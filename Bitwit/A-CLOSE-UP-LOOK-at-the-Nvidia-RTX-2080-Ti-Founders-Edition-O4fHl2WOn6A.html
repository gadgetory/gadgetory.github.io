NVIDIA has just announced or in vailed
three new graphics cards as part of
their twenty series family featuring the
new Turing GPU architecture very
exciting stuff I'm gonna quickly run
down the core specs of each of the cards
but the main focus of this video is
going to be the new founders edition
card / cooler because it's vastly
different than pretty much anything
we've seen from a reference card from
Nvidia in the past but some quick bullet
points here before we dive into the
finer details all three of these cards
are featuring in videos new RTX
technology which basically integrates
real-time ray tracing into the rendering
process to create much more realistic
images and that's mainly due to how the
lighting shadows and reflections are
rendered and how they operate
Nvidia showed us quite a few demos of
r-tx in action and they were pretty
impressive particularly for me the
battlefield demo was unbelievable it was
really kind of mind-blowing and it
definitely sets a new bar it's also
worth noting that devs have to add
support for RTX in their games in order
for the technology to take effect
thankfully it looks like we're starting
off with nearly a couple dozen games
with our tech support added in which is
quite exciting and I'm sure that list is
gonna grow as time goes on but let's
quickly go over the specs of these three
cards starting with the RT X 2070 which
is of course the successor to the gtx
1070 it's got 20 304 cuda cores a base
clock of 1400 and 10 megahertz a boost
of 1700 and 10 asterisks here because
the new founders edition cards are gonna
come factory overclocked so you might
potentially see that the efi version of
the card perform faster than some of the
base models that are released from ad
and board partners you've also got 8
gigs of GDD are 6 memory with a memory
speed of 14 gigabits per second on a 256
bit bus 448 gigabytes per second memory
bandwidth with a 6 phase power supply
175 watt TDP one 8 pin power connector
and it's gonna retail for $5.99 u.s.
$5.99 that's the price for the founders
Edition card which there will be a
premium on non founders Edition cards
are gonna start at $4.99 we'll just have
to wait and see if those prices actually
hold up when these cards are now
or released there's also no release date
yet for the RTX 2070 let's move on to
the next card which is the RT X 2080
successor to the GTX 1080 this is again
specs for the founders edition cards 20
944 CUDA cores a base of 1515 megahertz
a boost clock of 1800 megahertz with 8
gigs of GDD are 6 memory with a speed of
14 gigabits per second on a 256 bit bus
448 gigabits per second memory bandwidth
an eight phase-- power supply a 225 watt
TDP a single 6 pin and single 8 pin
power connector with a price of $7.99
and non founders Edition cards will go
for $6.99 September 20th is when this
card officially launches pre-orders are
available now however and then finally
we have the big boy the RT X 28 e TI
founders Edition at 40 352 CUDA cores a
base clock of thirteen hundred and fifty
megahertz a boost of sixteen hundred and
thirty five megahertz eleven gigs of GDD
are six with a memory speed of fourteen
gigabits per second on a three hundred
and fifty two-bit bus six hundred and
sixteen gigabytes per second memory
bandwidth thirteen phase power supply
two hundred and sixty watt TDP to eight
pin power connectors with a price of who
you might want to sit down for this one
eleven hundred and ninety nine dollars
non founders Edition cards will run you
for a cool grand this launches on the
same date as the r-tx 2080 on September
20th I believe pre-orders are also
available for that card now some quick
thoughts on this these are definitely
the highest prices that we've seen from
Nvidia for the cards belonging to these
tiers
so hopefully the performance of these
cards will scale with respect to the
prices and then finally this is the
first time that I can recall the TI
model being unveiled and and released on
the same date as the X X 8 0 SKU
generally the ti model has come you know
weeks or even months well after the 80
SKU but this time they're they're coming
together now switching gears here we can
sort of discuss the new founders Edition
cooler the whole cooling solution the
card itself most of the bureau that you
see from here
now is gonna be of the r-tx 20 atti so
just bear in mind that that cooler is
slightly different than the r-tx 1070
it's more or less identical to the 2080
but just bear in mind that these images
are going to be mostly of the r-tx 2080
ti first of all this is a completely
redesigned card from the last generation
as I mentioned before they've kind of
ditched the aggressive tessellated look
of the last gen for a more sleek and
minimal aesthetic of course everyone's
gonna have an opinion about this you
guys feel free to drop yours in the
comments they've also done away with the
blower style fan in place of dual axial
13 blade fans not exactly sure how big
they are they look about a hundred
millimeters I could be wrong but this
definitely makes the card look more like
an added board Partner card as opposed
to the traditional Fe shrouds we're used
to the fans are allegedly much quieter
than a blower style fan which makes
sense just because they're they're much
larger they not to spin it as high of
RPM and there's two of them and they
have like a you know fancy blade design
or whatever so all those things combined
I would imagine is gonna make for a more
comfortable gaming experience now
there's a silver shroud that's kind of
hugging the outer edges of both of the
fans I believe it's made of aluminum I
couldn't confirm that but it definitely
looks to be made of a material or
something similar and then there's this
rather plain black surface in between
the fans which is my least favorite part
of the card cosmetically just a little
bit too plain and boring you'll also
notice that this black area is much
larger on the r-tx 2080 and the r-tx
2080 ti than it is on the RT x 2070 you
can tell because the the margins around
the branded lettering is spaced very
differently and that's because the 20 80
and 20 ATT eyes are actually about an
inch and a half longer than the RT x
2070 at ten and a half inches and nine
inches respectively the two faster cards
are also slightly taller than the RT x
2070 at four point five five six inches
versus four point four three five inches
you still get the green LED backlit
branding on the side of the card but now
it says RT x instead of gtx to reflect
the new names and it's not our GB so new
I'm sure a lot of people are super
disappointed
it's not ready to be but who cares it's
also an open shroud card now so previous
generations had you know the the typical
blower fan and it was an enclosed card
ejecting all the hot air out the back of
the card now it's being ejected from
both the sides and also the back
basically these new EFI cards will be
exhausting hot air inside of your case I
think that definitely changes things you
know I've seen a lot of people including
myself used the older founders edition
cards inside of small form-factor cases
where getting heat trapped inside of a
little space can be really detrimental
to to your thermals in your performance
but you know people might have to look
elsewhere and check out some adding
board partner models that feature an
enclosed shroud to sort of accommodate
those scenarios so it's quite
interesting you guys also let me know
what you think of all this stuff
additionally we've got an SLI finger
that's in the same positions in the same
spot but it's been redesigned looks kind
of different here unless I'm just not
seeing it from the right angle but it's
been redesigned with support for envy
link so you know it's gonna be
delivering 50 times the transfer
bandwidth of previous technologies and
the high bandwidth SLI bridge seems to
have also received a makeover the top of
the card gets the old backplate
treatment but you can see here it swaps
the usual black color for silver which
again I believe is aluminum and this
backplate is unique in the sense where
it actually extends to wrap around the
edges of the card where it eventually
meets the fans like I mentioned earlier
on this creates sort of a unibody look
which i think is a refreshing change but
you guys let me know finally on the back
of the card we get three DisplayPort 1.4
port's meaning we can finally do 4k at
120 Hertz and probably well ahead of its
time still is 8k 60 Hertz support but
you know I'm sure Linus will put 55 of
them together and play minesweeper on it
at some point we also get a single hdmi
2.0 B and one USB type-c port for
virtual link which is the new open
industry standard that's currently being
developed to meet the power display and
bandwidth demands for next gen VR
headsets this is really cool because you
no longer have to eat up one of your
video outputs to play VR you have like a
4 panel setup or whatever a triple
display with the
companion monitor you don't have to
unplug one of those if you want to plug
in your VR headset or whatever it is so
that's actually pretty cool so that is
the new founders edition card for this
first wave of 20 series Turing GPUs what
do you guys think love it
hate it somewhere in between let me know
also share your thoughts on those prices
what kind of performance are you
expecting
now that the official pricing in specs
are out on the table that's all I got
for now guys thank you so much for
tuning in toss a like on this video if
you enjoyed it and get subscribed for
more tech content on the way including
more coverage of this new family of GPUs
very exciting stuff have a good one
y'all I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
