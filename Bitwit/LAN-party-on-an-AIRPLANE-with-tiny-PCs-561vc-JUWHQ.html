featuring a DIY in-flight entertainment
system where I actually had a little
portable monitor with a Raspberry Pi
strapped to it and that was suction
mounted to the entertainment screen on
the plane seat in front of me and it was
a stupid idea I mean for all intents
purposes it was very impractical it's
like why don't you just get a tablet
just get a frickin iPad and call it a
done deal I completely agree 100% but
little did you guys know that whole
project was essentially just preparation
for a much bigger project that we're
discussing and exploring today which is
essentially taking that same idea of a
portable monitor but replacing the
Raspberry Pi with a windows-based PC
creating multiple instances of that set
up and then essentially trying to run a
LAN party 35,000 feet in the air on an
airplane oh god that was like the
perfect intro and then the phone goes
off good lord hate spam spam sounds
really good right now sorry anyway this
is probably a dumb idea but it sounds
really cool and I'm up for the challenge
you know it sounds exciting we're
essentially going to try to do a
three-person land party myself wifey
sauce and crisps we're gonna be on a 13
hour flight to Taipei for Computex 2019
where we'll be doing event coverage so
it seemed like the perfect opportunity
to try and pull this off now the
hardware we chose for this was critical
to the missions success because we're
dealing with a confined space with
limited power options and a number of
other factors that we really had to take
into consideration before just picking
out parts willy-nilly so we each have an
Intel nook eight performance G mini PC
these things are super powerful for
their size I think I've heard Intel say
that they're currently the smallest
desktop pcs capable of delivering some
decent VR experiences and it seems like
they have the specs to back it up I mean
we've got an Intel Core i7 88 0 9 G 16
gigs of DDR 4 memory along with the
Radeon rx Vega em gh graphics processor
so yes that is an AMD graphics chip
inside of an Intel product and believe
it or not it pairs very nicely with the
Intel Core i7 chip that's in here
there's also a 1 terabyte SSD on board
and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Wi-Fi we don't
really care about so much for this
project but the Bluetooth is going to
come in handy as you'll see in a moment
now the AC outlets on our aircraft are
SPECT at 110 volts with a 100 watt peak
that our
might exceed underload but hopefully by
down clocking the heck out of our CPU
and GPU we can get these systems juiced
up on the plane this is by far my
biggest technical concern of the project
so we'll just have to wait and see what
happens now as far as monitors go to
gamers will be using the same you
perfect 13.3 inch 1920 by 1080 IPS
display that I featured in my in-flight
entertainment video because it's a great
panel and if you guys watch my dedicated
review on that product you'll understand
why the main draw here is Thunderbolt 3
support and since the Intel nook also
supports Thunderbolt 3 we can send power
and video to the monitor over a single
Thunderbolt 3 cable making the whole
setup a lot cleaner more seamless it's
gonna be awesome unfortunately I wasn't
able to secure a third you perfect
monitor here in time before a flight
which leaves in two days so I had to
slum it down to an eye yo-yo monitor
which is a cheap Chinese brand kind of
like you perfect actually
but this display gets its power straight
from USB there's no Thunderbolt 3
support so we have to use a standard
HDMI cable to get the job done a little
less graceful but it should still work
out now in order to get these systems
connected to each other so we can
actually land I picked up a black box
100 megabits per second 5 ports which I
like the fact that it's pocket-sized it
means it's not going to take up much
space it's good for travel but more
importantly its USB powered and since
all of our AC outlets will already be
occupied by the Knux we really needed to
find a switch with an alternate power
source plus I feel like we're gonna
incur a little bit less cable clutter
this way too now while we're landing it
up in the sky our fingers will be
interfacing with the lovely Coolermaster
SK 61 mechanical keyboard there's a
practically new product from
coolermaster it's a 60% keyboard with
genuine carry mix low profile switches
so it's very thin fits in the backpack
easily but also that 60% 10 keyless
design makes it relatively narrow as
well which is perfect for super thin
fold out trays on aircraft carriers like
the one will be on the cherry on top is
that these are Bluetooth supported so we
can connect to our nuts wirelessly
that's one less cable we have to worry
about the cherry on top of that cherry
however is that you can actually charge
with a USB type-c cable while you're
using the keyboard so you'll essentially
never go dark even midway through your
flight and how could you the things
chock-full of RGB lighting shocker
now it's also worth noting that we're
each bringing their own Bluetooth
headsets so that we can hear the in-game
audio and even talk to each other on the
plane without disturbing passengers
around us the last piece of hardware
here is the Logitech G 305 Gaming Mouse
this thing is awesome I bring it
everywhere is the same Mouse that I used
for my in-flight entertainment video it
is wireless but I would still use this
mouse as a daily it's super fast very
low latency and incredibly comfortable I
can keep it in my hand for hours on end
now then that's a lot of tech that each
of us gamers has to worry about finding
a space for a tower passenger seat of
course we could just throw the Knux on
the floor of the plane and proper
monitors up on the little fold-out trays
in front of us and call it a day but
there's just a few too many compromises
with that idea the first main issue
being safety I mean if you have knucks
on the floor with cables running between
them someone could easily trip and fall
that wouldn't be good also safety of the
device itself something that small could
easily be stepped on and secondly it's a
comfort issue and this is a bit more
subjective but at least for me when I'm
on a plane I can't stare at a laptop or
a tablet that's on my little fold-out
tray for very long without getting a
bunch of neck strain because I'm looking
downward it's such a steep angle because
it's so close to me and it just sucks
it's definitely no way to game on a PC
so because of those various compromises
I want to find a better solution and and
we have we're gonna emulate the sort of
system that we used for the in-flight
entertainment setup which is essentially
taking the PC and fixing it somehow to
the monitor and then taking that
two-piece set up and mounting that to
the seat in front of us the first step
was actually super simple because all
three of our monitors feature evasive
mounting holes and the Intel MUX
actually include a basa mounting bracket
so it was a completely seamless
integration that took all of 20 seconds
to set up securing that bulk of hardware
to the seat in front of us wasn't quite
as straightforward we basically had to
remove the backplate of the nook drilled
two holes in it before mounting a cheese
plate that contained a bunch of quarter
inch and three-eighths inch holes then
after reinstalling the backplate we were
able to attach a suction mount to the
cheese plate using the suction mounts
quarter-inch thread at that point we
basically had a compact DIY all-in-one
desktop PC that could be mounted ilvl on
any plane to any passenger seat in front
of you with an entertainment screen now
bear in mind this is a fairly heavy
chunk of hardware I mean with the
monitor and the nut combined we have
just shy of three pounds of actual
weight and so I actually did a 3-hour
mounting test with our suction mount to
ensure that it would fall down but
flight or anything like that
and it passed with flying colors there
was not an ounce of struggle no signs of
instability the suction man actually did
a great job as far as setting up the
actual land goes it was pretty much as
easy as getting all the PCs connected to
the switch and then assigning IP
addresses to each system before having
the host PC create a land match and
having the other two systems connect
using the hosts IP but with all that
said in all of my testing everything
ended up working flawlessly
after ironed out all the kinks albeit in
a controlled environment here on solid
ground so the big question now is how
did all of this perform 35,000 feet up
in the air I have no idea because I
haven't tried it yet so let's fast
travel I'm gonna fast travel roughly 48
hours into the future to Taiwan so I can
tell you all about the experience when I
get there I'm good all right I'll see
you on the other side okay I'm here in
Taiwan on the fourteenth floor my
Taiwanese hotel balcony and not so great
news the attempt to do a LAN party in
the air was a complete flop because the
outlets on the plane wouldn't actually
power the systems on at all even though
the outlets on the plane were rated for
the spec that I thought they would be
110 volts 100 watts the amperage is
probably the thing that was holding us
back in the end we all just kind of
looked at each other and after having so
much hype built up to make this work it
was a very very discouraging moment so
after several hours of sobbing silently
to myself I finally pulled myself
together and thought okay we have one
last chance to make this work on the way
home albeit we'll be down a gamer
because Chris actually has to leave to
go back home a day before wifey sauce
than I do so the very best we can hope
for a two-person LAN party so we put our
heads together and thought okay maybe we
can track down an AC power bank and we
actually happen to find one at the inner
pad stores that is from a brand called
enter pad the store was located in a
local tech shopping centre here in
Taipei they actually had three different
models available I was looking at the
two larger ones that had much higher
milliamp hour ratings but the store
employee assured me that those would not
be allowed on any Taiwanese Airlines so
I ended up going with the smaller one
the 40k model which is forty thousand
two hundred milliamps 120 volt output
with a hundred watt continuous output
and 120 watt peak brought the battery
back home plugged the Nook into it and
by golly it booted we got into Windows
10 just fine and we celebrated we laugh
we cry but then once we tried launching
csgo and we were just about to get into
the match for the first time the battery
died and clearly we went over the 120
watt peak limitation that the battery
had and it completely died killed off
the Nook and everything and so we were
very sad once again then I remember that
the Nook can be overclocked which means
it can also be under clocked so I
immediately plugged the Nook into the
wall jumped into the BIOS down clocked
our core i7 to 20 500 megahertz on all
cores then jump back into Windows so I
could get into AMD Walkman and then down
clocked the RX Vega graphics by 43% and
that's it our core clock down to around
2 to 300 megahertz under load powered
the Nook down plugged it back into the
AC power bank booted and then upon the
second attempt to launch into csgo we
were in and we were still getting well
over a hundred FPS in game because csgo
is a very demanding in fact we were able
to game for a good hour maybe just under
an hour before the battery finally died
so it's not great for longevity purposes
if you're actually trying to game for
more than an hour but for the purpose of
this video and just to show proof of
performance that a LAN party can be done
on a plane this was definitely good
enough for our needs so we immediately
went back to the store to buy a second
AC battery bank for wifey sauces system
and that brings us to present time where
we are here now at least in the context
of this video now our flight home
doesn't leave for another two days and I
don't want to wait that long so I'm
gonna fast travel into the future once
more in a last-ditch effort to make this
now two-person LAN party in the sky a
living reality and please by the might
of the PC gods let this work ok here we
go guys wish us luck
alright we're back in LA hey I'm getting
really good at snapping thanos would be
proud
so by golly we did it we actually got
the land party working on the way home
it is amazing how we were able to pull
this off now I have to apologize right
up front here that the b-roll footage
that we got on the plane isn't the best
because there is slight too heavy
turbulence at times and the cabin lights
were either dim or off during the entire
time we were filming so sorry about that
picture quality's not the best but still
very excited with the end result as
expected the battery packs gave us just
under an hour of continuous gaming
although we discover
but the plane outlets actually had no
issues recharging them so we could have
technically had multiple hour long
gaming sessions on the flight with a
couple hours of charging time in between
our keyboard and mice fit perfectly on
the fold of tables and apart from a few
brief moments of heavy turbulence that
would rattle the monitors and throw off
our mouse aim the experience was
comfortable enough that if we had
continuous power from the plane outlets
we could have easily played during the
entire flight rest assured I'm already
thinking of ways to make our next
airborne land party attempt more
streamlined in every way and finally
winding down here some of you guys might
be wondering does this break the current
world record for highest elevated land
party previously set by myself Paul and
a bunch of other tech youtubers several
years ago at the peak of Mount Elbert
and Colorado some 14,000 feet above sea
level I don't know you know it was never
really a goal or intent of this project
to break any records but I would kind of
say yes and no you know technically it's
a land party that we hosted at over
twice the elevation but it's also
relying on an aircraft to get us off
solid ground so it's sort of an its own
ballpark
to be honest it doesn't really make a
difference to me I just figured it was
worth addressing because people are
probably gonna bring it up anyway and
it's an interesting topic for discussion
if you guys want to share your thoughts
on it down below but think that's it
that's pretty much it this has been a
land party on a friggin plane guys thank
you so much for joining us on this wild
ride I already know there's gonna be a
part two follow-up where we try this
again at some point and knowing what we
know now I think round two is gonna be
exceptionally awesome so thanks for
sticking around for that guys toss a
like on this video if you enjoyed it get
subscribe for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon and I will see you all
in the next day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
