description for more info what's going
on everyone welcome back to the channel
hope you're all doing well today we're
doing a fun kind of video where I'm
pretty much just going to play around on
Amazon and try to build the best PC I
can for a ridiculously low budget once
again I am joined by none other than the
infamous wifey sauce she was hiding
behind me sneakily the whole time she's
just going to be chill in the background
and actually maybe you can help me with
this video a little bit honey so I'm
going to be trying to part out the best
PC I possibly can for a very low budget
but I haven't really decided what that
budget is going to be yet so maybe you
could just toss out a number again a
budget PC I'm going to say less than
let's do less than $700 could be any
number you want I have added our PC
before right I did do the $500 VR PC
back in the day
why don't we take it down a notch and do
400 400 dollars okay wow you're really
really putting the pressure on $400 okay
so $400 is the price point but I don't I
don't want to cut too many corners at
the same time you can build like a $200
PC no problem but if you're going to try
to game on it you're going to be making
some huge sacrifices along the way so
let's try to get let's see if we can
have our cake and eat it too
starting with the processor let's see
the best bang for the buck processor
under $100 has to be Intel G 45 60
perhaps it's 83 bucks
it's supposed to be way cheaper than
that one down there 443 that one 453
that's the G 4400 okay this is G 45 60
right here see this is a good this is a
better processor it's a dual core but it
has four threads because it supports
worth reading but it's a very good price
to performance chip its LGA 1150 51 it
came out q1 of this year I believe so
it's fairly current got Intel HD
graphics but we're going to try to get a
discreet graphics card here for 83
dollars though it's still a steal I
would say because other than that you've
got what core i3 but you're going to be
paying well over 100 bucks for one of
those and probably get similar
performance when you're when you're
talking about gaming specifically so
we're going to add this to Kearney go
why uh what a core i3
oh these yeah I like you should like I
think when they first came out they were
like seventy bucks maybe 65 around $70
this processor was just so darn good
that that's probably why the price has
gone up since q1 but I'm still going to
add it anyway we can always go back
nothing's set in stone we can always
change things around if we need to but
that's that's a good starting off point
so LGA 1151 it's not unlocked so we
don't need AZ 270 chipset for example
but we still need an LGA 1151
motherboard so let's do price low to
high fine my favorite my favorite
sorting option look at this forty seven
dollars for a gigabyte gah 110 M MDOT -
oh it's got an MDOT two slot on it
probably won't do us much good at this
price point but you never know
micro ATX board which is fine you can
usually find some pretty cheap cases
that are micro ATX oh it's only got two
DIMM slots which for a budget build
isn't an issue unless you really want to
upgrade and max out the ram later on but
look at that I mean it's pretty basic
it's got it's only got a four pin EPS
connector for the CPU it's got a PCI
Express by 16 slot there that's good USB
3 I'm going to say we do it with a
little oh hold on what's what's the next
one up there's a $47 also the same price
oh this is LGA 1150 though screw that
and this is and it gets more expensive
for the other ones okay we're going with
this the the h1 10m m dot - adding that
to cart no we don't want - for your
peripherals we want - for your
peripherals plan peripherals protection
plan for four dollars it's only for two
to me accent we have a budget at Florida
bucks you're right
$130 so way to stay frugal we are
already at 130 dollars I think we can I
think we can so we got let's get the
other big component out of the way next
which would be the graphics card no can
be kind of tricky because with all the
crypto currency mining that I was
talking to you about how that's been
inflating the graphics card prices
fortunately some of the lower end GPUs
haven't been hit as hard with with the
inflated rates right so let me see what
a gtx 1050 TI goes for these days
yeah it's still yeah that's eaten up a
lot of our budget right layer 150 we
need a card that's closer to closer to
100 I think so let's just remove the TI
and we have the gtx 1050 which still has
a 2gig frame buffer for that's still a
little pricey I think we can find wait
110 109 dollars for an MSI gaming GTX I
actually have this card I'm pretty sure
it's ever so slightly faster than the rx
560 even though they're about the same
price two gigs
let's do it Add to Cart four-year PC
peripherals Protection Plan B alright
we're going to load you sure yeah all
right there's trick question you
answered correctly 239 dollars so far we
still have quite a few that but you know
what we have our big ones we have our
CPU our motherboard and our graphics
card out of the way and those like those
like the money eaters for sure so next
up let's do we got to have RAM we need
we need the Rams you could get away with
four gigs you could but it would be
difficult to run certain triple-a titles
but just demand more of that particular
resource sorry my phone's going off
battlefield one I know is known to get a
little bit of micro stutter if you only
have a four gig stick in there if I
remember correctly so let's let's do
eight gigs going to be tough man how
much does eight gigs of DDR four go for
these days what's the cheapest you can
find it's crucial for gigs so we can get
two of these it's 30 bucks 31 bucks for
one stick is this ECC I don't think so
things are some normal EPP ECC is like
like server grade memory so it wouldn't
work technically in this gaming PC we're
going good I mean it's not flashy by any
means NAND flash definitely um but it's
functional assuming it works out of the
box so probably didn't come in a box
this probably comes in like a ziplock
bag but for 31 dollars we could get two
of them and we would have dual channel
and that would be better than just a
single dim in there so get professional
inspiration for only 81 dollars oh wow
great for more than double the price of
the product you're buying will install
it for you thanks Amazon no we're just
going to add this to cart - let's add
two of them where are you at 300 we just
talked $300 because I put two those
sticks so we've got eight gigs here so
we under we only have we have what was
$99 we have nine we have less than $100
now to get our case our power supply and
our storage our CPU cooler is already
taken care of actually I should have
mentioned that because a stock fan
cooler comes included with the CPU okay
the last time it's a crappy one but it
works what we should do next power
supply okay let's do the case okay
plastic that's funny
oh no wait what if we could do a case
and power supply combo because you know
some cases like especially the really
crappy
cheap ones will come included with a
power supply that's generally garbage
but if you're trying to save a crap ton
of money it could be a it could be an
option I'm not gonna say a good option
but it's an option so let's say let's
say Kay some power supply for last
let's do storage okay storage I say
let's start with a hard drive because
even if we don't have room for an SSD at
least we can put everything on the hard
drive let's do a one terabyte I feel
like one terabyte is pretty standard
just because games are getting so much
larger these days and you run out of a
500 gig drive length back so let's see
what we got here is this what is this
et gig that's not going to cut it this
however for five dollars more you go
from 80 gigs to one terabyte this is
Western Digital as well caveat Green Egg
good for the environment Add to Cart for
30 dollars yes we're doing it and
and power supply and cake uh well hold
on do you think we can fit an SSD in
here oh yeah because even though an SSD
isn't that why you're not me even though
an SSD isn't required because very hard
driving here it makes the overall
snappiness of your PC just so much
quicker and it really is a game changer
so maybe we could squeeze in let's see
they're going to be like 128 gigabyte a
scale stability so yeah it's gonna be
tough man's gonna be tough we are
getting close 64 gig I don't think this
is gonna happen because we only have
like $70 left to get a tooth in a car
you just
boysband dollars hold on hold on
you look chronic there's 128 gig SATA
Drive hold on let me double check to see
if that motherboard actually if the end
up to slot supports PCIe and standard I
can't add or you don't get the ollars
but hold on ultra-fast end up to a PCIe
gen - okay so it's got PCF and say the
mode it's got say that as well so the m2
slot on this motherboard actually
supports SATA drives not just PCIe or
one of the other that means this drive
technically would work for $50.00 it is
kind of steep but let's let's add it
tentatively for now and that gives us
about 20 dollars left for if we can find
a really crappy case in power supply
combo then at least then at least we're
not really short cutting much of the
other components we're still getting an
SSD for a boot drive that's a decent
capacity CPU and GPU pretty strong I do
not care what the case looks like if the
budget is $400 so let's just try case
case and power supply so we've got this
law justice 480 watts see look this one
comes with a 480 watt power supply but
it's $45
I do Lois dad Oh Oh
Zellman ATX this kind of power supply
shoot does not not ever Rose will come
on Rose well oh wait so there's an
option for case and power supply oh wait
what the heck that's a mini ITX case
though and it's $55 okay wait does this
not come with a power supply then no it
doesn't we might be in trouble here
honey I think we're gonna have to get
you might succeed
hold on what is this cables unlimited
80s oh that is ugly a special kind of
ugly only a mother could love a case
hopper working that's pretty gruesome
hey at least no one would steal your
system right no one would like walk into
a land party look at that thing and be
like coming with me yeah
are you dollars I mean you wouldn't
really go down too far over the budget
and it comes with a 300 watt power
supply which is enough for our CPU and
GPU I think it's what 75 watt TDP on the
GTX 1050 probably 65 watts
I would guess there abouts for the G 45
60 what is this crap I don't think it
has a power supply for your budget it's
going to be hard to find it together
nothing's impossible
I can do it no getting rid of the SSD
would kill me that's a huge compromise I
have to do the ugly case go back to mr.
ugly really we're gonna go with the oh
man are we doing this there's only one
left in stock popular I'm shocked
hey you know what it's got ATX support
it'll support our motherboard we can do
it oh man computer Add to Cart add four
hundred and ten dollars so we did go
over a little bit over but $10 isn't bad
honestly most people have $10 at least
to to fork out if they were going to buy
PC like this and this is cool because
this is not too far away from like the
price of a console so if you are
considering getting like an Xbox one or
ps4 pro for example or even one of the
next-generation consoles
you know the names of them but for $400
I think that's a pretty good deal do you
think we should just buy this stuff and
like build it later yeah okay good
answer so here's a final look at all of
our parts for this $400 PC it's looking
pretty good I think we'll be able to run
most games even some of the triple-a
titles at high settings because the GTX
1050 it's a pretty damn good bargain and
from what I've seen on like benchmark
reviews and stuff like that it's going
to pair really nicely with the G 4560 so
I'm really excited to actually see this
all built and tested so I guess you guys
can consider this the end of part one to
this little mini series build thank you
