stylings three here I think you're gonna
love them
nice can't wait to check these out
thanks by the way my car broke down and
I was wondering if you what the whoa
whoa whoa hey hey stomach start don't
don't know what's happening hey be quiet
in here Oh Kyle wasn't prepared to be
blown away by the new silent wings three
fans from be quiet are you for a cooler
quieter system click on the link in the
description for more info lots of gas so
this week I spent some time testing out
the fastest $1,000 PC which I put
together a week or two ago so if you
missed that build video be sure to check
it out now the main objective of that
system was to get it under a mid-range
price point but have it deliver high-end
gaming performance using a 60 600 K and
a ZOTAC gtx 1070 amp Edition so how did
it do well the results are in and
congratulations you're not the father
wait that's not right
these are the results we're talking
about today and as you can see here I
pushed our 6600 K to 4.5 gigahertz on
air with the hyper 212 Evo which did a
nice job of keeping low temps from
surpassing 58 degrees Celsius
overclocking our GPU on the other hand
was a bit of a struggle due to thermal
constraints not due to the cards custom
cooler itself but rather the limited air
flow in our petty axq pack 3 chassis now
in the build video from a week or two
ago i voiced my concerns about the cases
single 140 millimeter intake fan and its
ability to provide adequate cooling for
our beefy GPU unfortunately I was
correct in my assumption as the
overclocked card quickly rose above 81
degrees Celsius when maxing out the temp
targets something I rarely see
aftermarket cards in well ventilated
chassis x' do to keep thermals in check
I dialed back the temp target to the
safe rated limit of 81 degrees Celsius
which did squander our Max OC potential
a bit allowing us a core clock offset of
just 125 megahertz and a 400 megahertz
boost on the memory clock with these
settings the card had a max core clock
speed of 2070 megahertz but after 20
minutes of Unigine Heaven 4.0 we did
encounter some thermal throttling with
the frequency averaging down to 1979
megahertz as a result I'd be very
curious to see how upgrading and
expanding the fan situation in this
chassis would improve thermal conditions
and thus the cards overclocking Headroom
but even though we couldn't swing any
balls to the wall aggressive o'seas this
is a gtx 1070 after all which is a
powerful card even at reference speeds
so on that note let's see how it fared
in the seven benchmarks I ran on Windows
10 with the 370 2.70 wickel drive
you
so even with a mediocre overclock on our
GPU the GTX 1070 amp Edition showed
pretty solid performance all around
yielding over ninety FPS in four of the
six games tested at 1920 by 1080 and
topping 60fps in five of the titles at
2560 by 1440 not too bad for the
somewhat underwhelming score in GTA 5 I
should mention that the game was run
with 4x
msaa which is pretty crushing on the GPU
and to improve frame rates users can
probably crank the setting down to 2 X
for example without much loss in visual
quality especially at quad HD finally
the acoustics of the system were tested
in order to see how much noise was
generated when idling and under load
here's a listen
as you can hear the ridge was no louder
idling than it was when powered off
thanks to the zero rpm fans on the zotac
cooler and I suppose that's one benefit
of only having one case fan load
acoustics are definitely audible from a
few feet away but it's far from
bothersome and easily drowned out by
even the slightest in-game audio
wrapping things up here it pains me to
see a killer card like so tax GTX 1070
amp Edition unable to reach its fullest
potential due to the cases thermal
constraints and users looking to build
out this exact system should really
consider upgrading the front intake fan
and installing a 120 exhaust at the back
of the case if they can spare an extra
30 to 40 bucks that being said the rig
still delivers great gaming performance
at 1440p with enough horsepower for
turning on all the eye candy that we PC
gamers love oh so much all the while the
PC maintains a favorable acoustic
profile for unobtrusive gaming sessions
case in point if the budget for your
next PC is in the ballpark of $1000
today's findings indicate that this may
very well be one of the fastest gaming
PC's your money can buy but that's gonna
do it for now guys before you go don't
forget it does me a like on this video
