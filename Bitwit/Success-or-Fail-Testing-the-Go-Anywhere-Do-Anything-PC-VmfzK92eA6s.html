it going welcome back to the channel
today we're taking a closer look at my
new go anywhere do anything PC which I
put together last week the build video
is already up you can go check it out if
you haven't already essentially what
this rig is and the objective of this
build was to build something that could
that I could bring with me on the go to
events like land syndicate in Seattle as
well as Computex all the way in Taipei
so these are really meant for
long-distance travel something that I'm
going to be taking with me on a plane
and a carry-on bag carry-on size was
very important to me because I just
prefer to have my really expensive
computer hardware with me and not put it
in the hands of you know the airport or
TSA or whatever whatever it is so this
fortunately the no 202 case that we're
rocking here does fit into carry-on size
bag but there were there were some good
questions and comments that you guys
brought up in the first video which was
if you're looking for something portable
that you can just you know take with you
and go why not just get a laptop and
that's a very very good good point
because that would be a lot easier
granted to just be able to put that into
a backpack so for portability I
completely agree with you 100% it
already comes with you know a monitor
you have to bring a monitor or a
separate keyboard with a laptop whereas
you do have to bring all your various
peripherals with a desktop however I'm
going to be posting a video probably as
we get closer to land syndicate showing
you guys exactly which peripherals I'm
using and how I'm going to fit
everything all those things inside of a
single carry-on bag which should be
pretty sweet and the fact that I'm that
I'm using a carry-on this is meant for a
carry-on also gives me a little bit more
breathing room and leeway to work with
then let's say if I were trying to
squeeze everything into a backpack
because this no 202 here is certainly a
bit too wide to fit in most backpacks
out there so um the other reason why I
went with the desktop over a laptop is
because the the amount of power that's
in this thing the amount of sheer horse
power would cost a fortune in laptop
form that's that's just the nature of
notebooks guys
I would have to spend easily to $3,000
plus in order to replicate the amount of
processing power that's in this system
by the way it's a 6700 K as well as an R
9 nano from AMD but but yeah I mean I
already have a nice a very nice gaming
laptop it's the MS GS 16 goes pro from
MSI and it's got a gtx 970m in there
very great awesome mobile processor I
also did a video on that whole laptop
but it honestly just pales in comparison
to the sheer amount of power that this
thing has so and the last reason why I
went with the desktop other than the
fact that I really like building pcs is
an upgrade path so I really wanted to
have the option to slap in a new video
card or something like that or new
processor or new chipset or whatever it
is more memory and that sort of thing
the day that any one of those parts gets
old or that it just isn't cutting it
anymore and with a laptop sure if you're
you know strictly memory bound or
storage bound you can generally swap out
those those components in most notebooks
however if you know your CPU or your GPU
is just getting really sluggish pretty
much the only option you have with a
laptop is to buy a new one and I didn't
want to run into that issue so overall
pretty happy with my choice here I'm
sticking with it's going with a
full-blown desktop but on that note why
don't we go ahead and crack open the
crack open what do we go ahead and
switch over to the desktop here so you
can get an idea of what I'm looking at
on this system by the way I'm using this
PC to record this video that's why it's
all hooked up and stuff so fun fact also
you should probably go full screen right
now if you're watching this so that you
can see all the little little numbers
and stuff that we're about to check out
so right now I've got sapphire tricks
open it's a overclocking software from
sapphire of course just like MSI
Afterburner or precision decks from EVGA
the reason why I chose Strix initially
was because it allows you to overclock
HBM which the r9 nano has however any
time I try to mess with it even if it's
like a 5 megahertz
you know overclock even with like power
limit increase it just crashes every
single time and I didn't really have
time to troubleshoot anything so if you
guys have any idea why I can't overclock
HBM right now go ahead and blow up the
comments let me know and all
check it out later but apart from that
this is a great overclocking tool as
we're about to see there are some issues
when overclocking the r9 Nanna or with
let's let's just ignore overclocking for
a moment if it's just if you're just
running the Nano at stock clock
frequencies it does have a tendency to
throttle and the reason why is because
it only has has a smaller power envelope
than say the theory or the theory X it
only has 175 watt TDP compared to 275
watt on those other two cards and so
because we're dealing with a smaller
power WAMP power envelope or we're
seeing a lot of throttling and I'll give
you an example of that right here with
Unigine of unige in heaven 4.0 you can
see right now we are at stock we're
operating I've got GPU C open here and
these aren't the max values these are
just the real time values that the card
is spitting out right now
I hope hopefully this system doesn't
crash as I'm making this video but here
we go you can see right now we're at
around 990 to 980 megahertz but we're
not actually hitting that 1,000
megahertz at all in fact you know
granted wheat we are getting pretty
close and there are a couple instances
where you do get that 1 gigahertz that
one like right there 1 gigahertz like
that that's great however it's not very
consistent and we were seeing frequent
dips below that at just our regular
stock frequency so that's that's no good
we want to actually change that and the
reason why additionally why via the our
9 nano throttles isn't just because of
power but it's thermals as well and so
you can see here I've set a pretty
aggressive fan curve within tricks to
kind of aid in that throttling issue so
the first thing we want to do here
because this is power bound we're going
to increase the power limit and see how
that affects our clock speed so as you
can see right now we're operating
consistently at a thousand megahertz
which it is pretty amazing considering
all we did was increase the power limit
now granted if we had a more in-depth
software to take a look at you know real
real time statistics we'd probably see a
couple dips below a thousand megahertz
even with the power limit where it is
but that's okay because they're very
slight compared to what we what we were
just saying and
overall your gaming experience is going
to be more or less smooth and you're not
going to really notice the difference so
I'm pretty happy about that now that
we're actually hitting the frequency
that our stock card is rated for now we
can begin to start overclocking the card
and I was already dialing in some stuff
earlier before recording the video and
what I found to be a stable overclock
for for my car here was about 1045
megahertz so we're gonna go ahead and
try that out I'm going to click apply
let's not crash because if I crash if
the system crashes by the way I Lou I
have to start this video over from
scratch because OBS won't actually
record the video if it's not if I don't
manually stop recording it so fingers
crossed everyone and now you can see
we're at a thousand forty-four megahertz
I don't know why it went from 1045 2044
but whatever we're pretty much at our
desired overclock here and we're hitting
that consistently and I can even open up
the hardware monitor within tricks just
to get a second opinion here actually
it's probably using gpu-z anyway so
they're going to be the same but yeah
we're hitting a very consistent clock
speed now but the other thing I wanted
to address here is system acoustics now
because the yarn I nano has an issue
with thermal throttling like I said I
had to make this fan curve pretty
aggressive we're going all the way up to
80 or 80 or so percent on the GPU fan
speed just in order to maintain some
decent thermals but but that's okay
because even though the system does get
pretty noisy under load when gaming it
doesn't get noisy at all when I'm
editing in Premiere Pro for example and
that's really important to me because I
get super distracted with fan noise when
I'm editing
however when I'm gaming I'm using a pair
of cans anyway and all my my sound is
coming through my headphones I can't
hear the system at all so even though
yes acoustics aren't the greatest here
they're not going to be much of an issue
for my purposes so on that's no - ladies
and gentlemen why don't we go ahead and
take a look at our benchmarks here so I
ran three different games at 14:40 so we
only only doing quad HD results right
now the reason why is because I just
feel like the r9 nano kind of hits that
sweet spot where it's great for 1440
it's a little bit overpowered for 1080
and not quite 4k ready as it's
as plus that's the resolution I can see
myself gaming at for the most part with
this system so we're going to do quad HD
results however I am testing both
overclock frequencies as well as stock
clock so we're going to be able to see
the impact that overclocking has on
gaming performance with this card which
which is pretty revealing and it's it's
good I'm going to let you know right now
it's good so starting off with Metro
last light which is a very demanding
title as you can see here all the
quality settings that I'm using didn't
enable physics or anti-aliasing
but overall we got an average frame rate
of 66 so very playable frame rates all
around you can see the GPU was about 66
degrees Celsius not too shabby however
our 6700 K this is where we're also
talking about temps well while I go over
the benchmarks the the temps really
aren't that great we're getting
eighty-three degrees Celsius on the
hottest core on core number three
fortunately this was the hottest the
chip ever got geez do you guys hear that
there's no sorry I live by a noisy
Street just to just ignore them but yeah
so this is really not the greatest not
too happy about that I actually even had
to disable turbo boost in the BIOS
because just that extra 200 megahertz
that the 6700 K spits out that it can
ramp to was just overheating the chip
like a like a like a bitch like a bitch
like a total bash it was getting to like
ninety degrees Celsius which is not OK
so bringing that down disabling turbo
boost really helped to alleviate some of
the thermals there but as you can see
it's getting pretty toasty let's go
ahead and look at our overclock settings
we've got 74 74 frames per second on
average so that's a pretty nice boost
there from going from 66 to 74 I didn't
do the percentage and stuff this time
but you can figure it out yourself it's
actually a really nice boost from just a
forty six or forty five megahertz
overclock there without even touching
the HBM mind you and as you can see
we're still pretty hot here on the on
the 6700 K with 81 degrees Celsius it's
not super alarming where it's like your
system is going to blow up or melt but
it's not ideal either and the GPU 406
degrees Celsius man that is that is
quite toasty I tell you I know this is
actually a bug with
gpu-z for whatever reason wasn't reading
out correctly you're going to see that
happen again later in the benchmarks but
on average I was seeing the GPU hit
anywhere from 75 to 76 degrees Celsius
under load while gaming with my fan
curve that I put in which again is
pretty it's pretty beefy fan curve
getting up to pretty high RPM's there
but here's GTA 5 at stock frequencies
once again we're seeing a pretty decent
performance even at stock ninety six
point eight frames per second on average
now this was a blend of high and very
high settings in GTA 5 so the game looks
super crispy very very very nice and the
a lot of eye candy is turned on however
MSAA is not I figured since we're gaming
at quad HD the jaggies aren't quite is
noticeable so might as well save some
frames there by turning it off now you
can see here the 6700 K is doing a lot
more reasonable in terms of temperatures
we're getting low 70s this time around
which is really nice to see considering
even the GTA 5 is a pretty CPU intensive
game so I was happy to see that 494
degrees Celsius on the GPU whoo-whoo is
that is that hotter than last time
yes it rose it rose by a whole almost 90
degrees but again just to bug nothing to
be alarmed of and then going on to our
overclocked 104 frames per second so
going from 96 or almost 97 to about 104
it's a it's a modest gain but still
definitely will get you a little bit
more smooth ease up in there and then
we're seeing that the CPU really be put
under load a bit more here at 79 degrees
Celsius at the max core definitely quite
a bit hotter than at stock and then GPU
is actually reading out pretty pretty
well right now 70 degrees Celsius so
that's a bit more reasonable and in line
with what the actual operating
temperature is not 400 whatever degrees
and then moving on to Crysis 3 our most
demanding test for today we saw an
average of 53 frames per second on
average this is pretty this is maxed out
this is a completely maxed out with the
exception of MSAA
in Crysis 3 so that's that's just a nice
way to show show off the performance of
the r9 nano it's flexing its muscles a
little bit here we've also got some
decent temps
again 71 degrees or 72 at the hottest
core and GPU just don't pay attention to
that and then overclocking we went to we
broke 60 frames per second which is nice
so going from 53 to 60 very very sizable
gains right there mad gains bro mad
gains all around with overclock in the
Nano and finally we're taking a look at
3d mark fire strike extreme we got 62 98
at stock again don't look at the GPU
temps CPU temps were fairly decent in
the low 70s and then going to
overclocked we broke 7,000 which is
really nice to see again CPU temps
looking good and the GPU actually got
fairly hot fairly warm that time around
but granted that was just with the
synthetic benchmark and not real-world
gaming so I'm not too concerned about
that and I think that's pretty much it
kind of sums up this video more or less
we kind of blasted through that just now
so yeah the other thing that I wanted to
say before we head out before I head out
is future plans for this guy might
include if I can getting my hands on a
6700 a lock skew processor and swapping
it out for the 6700 K that's currently
in there and using that chip just
somewhere else where it can be
overclocked and really realize its full
potential because it's just kind of a
waste of performance in this system like
I said in the first video the only
reason I used a 6700 K is because I
already had one lying around didn't want
to spend the extra 3 400 dollars on a
new chip but that would be something to
look out for for me in the future is if
I can find a good deal on on the locks
cube process or I might just do that but
let me know guys in the comments what
you think of these numbers and these
performance results that we've seen
today and yeah perhaps in the future
I'll do another one of these builds but
make it like even more portable and just
as powerful if not more so that features
liquid cooling for the the CPU maybe we
can go with a Core 500 from fractal
design or even one of those silverstone
like the SG 0 v 2.0 versions that
support 120 rads and things like that
but yeah that's that's for another time
thank you guys so much for watching this
video
oh I know it's really loose kind of
format today I'm not even wearing pants
actually I never wear pants so that
that's irrelevant but yeah sorry for the
crappy webcam quality hopefully the mic
sounds good because that's a nice mic
and it's a mess in my room so there you
have it it's one of those just one of
those videos guys it's just one of those
days
ow I didn't really hurt being dramatic
now okay thank you guys for watching
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already go ahead and toss me a like as
well if you enjoyed this video if you
thought it was a fun fun fun and and
insightful ah and yeah I hope you guys
have a good whatever day it is and I'll
see you guys very soon take it easy guys
