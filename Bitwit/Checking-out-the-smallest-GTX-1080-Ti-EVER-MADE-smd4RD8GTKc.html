you by LastPass LastPass is a service
that securely manages all your passwords
so you never get stuck at the login
screen again we've all been there
scratching our heads trying to remember
that 10 character alphanumeric code
until throwing our hands up in the air
before resetting the damn thing for the
third or fourth time oh my favorite part
is when the verification email takes
forever to arrive so suspenseful
LastPass keeps track of everything so
you don't have to write remember or
reset your passwords all your data is
securely protected at every step and not
having to remember a complex string of
characters means you can make them as
complex as you want and unique to each
account so you know that Eclipse that
everyone won't shut the hell up about
well those come around about as often as
I log into Facebook so whenever I do I
get hit with a thousand security
questions that feels like some twisted
game show about how well I know myself
what's your favorite band Kyle you know
from like 12 years ago and we asked you
the first time eventually I just started
putting not Nickelback or all my
security answers the point is LastPass
saves you all the time and headache that
comes with logging in put your passwords
on the autopilot once and for all
with LastPass click the link in the
description below to get LastPass for
free what's going on everyone welcome
back to the channel hope you're all
doing well today we are taking a look at
this guy
this is Zoet X GTX 1080p I mini you
wouldn't really know by looking at the
box because ZOTAC sort of cheaped out
they're using the same the same
packaging as their regular GT X 1080
eyes apparently because there's no mini
I don't see a mini here that's why when
I got this box I was really confused I
was like wait but this is in fact a
smaller than average card if you
actually stack it up next to a gtx 980ti
founders edition then you can see it is
quite a bit definitely a few inches
shorter there at eight point three
inches long for all of you who use the
smarter measuring system that's two
hundred and eleven millimeters while
it's much smaller or shorter I should
say than a founders Edition card it is
quite a bit lengthier than something
like the gtx 1070 mini from gigabyte you
can see here it's actually about an inch
and a half longer which puts it in sort
of a it's sort of a stopgap between
certain mini cards and a full-length
graphics card which isn't too bad I mean
all things considered this is a GT X
1080 Ti this is one of the most powerful
graphics cards
on the market today so the fact that
they're able to get it down to even this
size is pretty impressive but if you
were looking for something ultra compact
then maybe you know you might have to
resort to something like this gtx 1070
which again it's still a very high-end
card but pales in comparison in terms of
performance with the gtx 980ti here so
let's talk a little bit more about the
card before we actually swap it out for
the 1070 here and run some benchmarks
we're gonna become actually running it
inside of my go anywhere do anything PC
which takes place inside of the node -
OH - from fractal design it's a
wonderful mini ITX case I just figured
someone who's buying this card is
probably most likely going to be putting
it in a system somewhat similar to this
in terms of the form factor factor
that's mini-itx maybe some limited
airflow so I feel like we're gonna be
testing it today in a pretty and in a
system that's more or less
representative of what the average user
who's interested in the card like this
would be putting it in themselves so
that's we're gonna do today let's talk
about the card first off the shroud the
shroud looks pretty nice it's color
neutral time got this gunmetal gray and
for being fully plastic it's actually
pretty sturdy I think the fact that it's
shorter as opposed to longer helps with
that you get somes otech branding on the
front which does light up in white
there's also some white LED accents just
these little these little edges right
here let it and white very tasteful not
too overdone and the fact that there's
no RGB on this card some of you are
gonna really like others you like now
what an RGB but there's actually a
practical reason why they've omitted RGB
on this card it's because without the
RGB controller they're actually able to
free up some space on the PCB or rather
make it shorter so you know they're like
you know what let's just forget about
RGB whatever we'll reduce the size of
the card even further also the the
copper heat pipes we've got five six
millimeter copper heat pipes that have
also been bent in such a way to reduce
the the cooler size overall take a look
at the fans here for a minute you might
have noticed that they are actually
rocking different blade designs and
sizes for that matter so the one on the
left is a 90 millimeter
it's got got these slightly more angular
or sharper maybe a little bit thinner
blades on them this is optimized for air
flow and then this is a 100 millimeter
fan that's got slightly wider blades
optimized for static pressure just
intended to keep the airflow over the
main components a little bit longer so
apparently ZOTAC has figured that this
combination of fans somehow optimizes
the cooling for all the main components
including the GPU memory and vrm of
course we're gonna put this to the test
inside of our little system here so
that's pretty cool the fans look again
very high quality and all that stuff on
the front here oh I should mention that
you can disable the LEDs if not in the
software then by simply unplugging the
appropriate cable we've also got two
eight pin plugs to power this card which
may or may not be a great thing
depending on the situation so if you're
trying to put this for example one of
the reasons why I really like this mini
1070 here is because it only has one
power plug and it just makes a little
bit more convenient and easy to sort of
route that instead of having two plugs
especially when you're in a cramped case
like the note 202 so that's something to
be aware of a mini card that still has
two full-blown power plugs that's that's
something to consider for your next
build if you're going the mini ITX route
that being said the other thing i've
just romantic standpoint while we're
making little critiques here even though
though tech has done a bang-up job of
making this card pretty much color
neutral from head-to-toe up to the fans
the cooler itself the shroud and even
that really nice backplate there's no
more like yellow just smearing all over
the graphics card so that's really nice
but I will say that it would have been
cool to have some nickel plated copper
heat pipes instead of just the raw
copper there I'm just saying it's not a
huge deal but even if it was just that
one even just this one maybe the ends of
of the other ones sticking out and I
don't even care about this no one's
gonna see that that would just make it a
little bit more color neutral than it
already is but not a big thing we've
also got SLI fingers you could actually
pair two of these guys in two-way SLI
and just have a beast of a system taking
up not too much space at all this would
go really nice and like a micro ATX
high-end gaming machine or something
like that you can get all these ideas
stop yourself cows stop yourself now
video outs we should probably look at
the video out so dual link DVI that's a
standard reference we've got three
DisplayPort 1.4 s and a single HDMI 2.0
B now the last thing before we get this
installed I just want to quickly throw
up all the basic specs here on the
screen so you guys can take a look at it
go ahead absorb it all right take mental
notes alright looking pretty good all
around we're still getting 11 gigs frame
buffer this is just so much spec inside
of such a little card it's pretty
exciting so on that note ladies and
gentlemen let's go ahead and install
this
and run some tests alright the graphics
card is installed inside of our node 202
system we've got GTA 5 fired up this is
running at 2560 by 1440 in windowed mode
we've got Franklin chillin on the
garbage truck just rolling around the
streets of lo Santos and we've got some
interesting observations here with our
GPU first of which here's here's a quick
look at some of the afterburner settings
we've I've maxed out the power limit
slider I've left the temperature limit
slider as is at 84 degrees C because as
you're about to see this cars getting
quite warm I also did not do any sort of
overclocking whatsoever because the
temperatures that we're getting right
now under load are spiking up to 83 84
degrees C this is just with the the fan
speed running it auto cranking up to a
hundred does cool things down by a few
degrees not quite as much as I
anticipated and it does also make the
system quite noisy as well but you'll
also notice that the GPU load
utilization right here is not quite at a
hundred percent like even most of the
time or really any of the time it seems
to just be sort of fluctuating in the
all over the place anywhere from the 50%
to the 80% range occasionally going up
to 99% but because of that we're also
seeing some fluctuations in the core
clock frequency and to be honest since I
started testing this card I have yet to
see it just lock in sort of a sustained
frequency it's just all over the place
again so this is kind of interesting I
did do the benchmarks already as I
mentioned and the results the actual
performance seems to be okay it seems
there abouts within the range of what
you'd expect from a gtx 1080p i but just
to verify to see if we're really missing
out on any performance and if so how
much i'm also gonna be testing i've
decided i'm gonna pop in the 1080i
founder's edition and run the same
benchmarks just to compare performance
between the two all right so our so tech
mini cart is taking a breather while we
test out the 1080i bounders edition
which is running right here we've got
Unigine heaven' 4.0 loaded up you can
see here temperatures are about the same
well first off we're not overclocking
we're just maxing out the power slider
temperature sliders the same as it was
with the zotac card at 85 degrees C and
Auto fan curve and all that so same
temperature is more or less 85 84 the
fact that the zotac card is pretty much
as hot as a fan addition card isn't the
greatest it's not something that I would
personally advertise and then also we've
got that same sort of fluctuating
frequency the core clock frequency is
all over the place once again however
when you take a look at GPU load with
our founders Edition card you'll notice
that we are now more consistently
hitting anywhere from 98 to 100 percent
utilization so the question here is even
though the temperatures and the
frequency seem to be a little bit dodgy
with both cards ours otech cards load
utilization is all over the place
whereas the founder's edition seems to
be at a more constant 100% usage so does
that make a difference when it comes to
gaming benchmarks we've already run the
tests on the zotac card so I'm just
gonna run those same tests on our
founders Edition here and throw up all
of that data on to some graphs for us so
we can compare the performance between
either of these cards to see if that GPU
load utilization fluctuating so
drastically on ours otech card is going
to affect its performance in any way oh
and by the way the risin 7 1700 for
those of you who are curious is running
its stock frequencies I have not
overclocked it at all for this test and
then we've also got the memory running
at 29 33 which is the highest I could
actually get it to stabilize and food
properly so on that note here are the
benchmarks
alright so there you guys have it just
to summarize some of the results that we
were seeing pretty comparable
performance between both cards which is
kind of interesting since this the zotac
mini card here it's actually coming out
of the box factory overclocked with
about I'd say a 38 megahertz
boost over the founders edition and yet
we were seeing pretty much on par
performance there were several instances
however where the mini was outperforming
the 10 atti founders Edition albiet by a
small margin probably anywhere from
between 1 and 5 percent at the very most
we were seeing the mini perform a little
bit better but for the most part very
similar cards actually even though they
looked drastically different just in
terms of the performance that they're
both delivering again both of these
cards were tested at stock I didn't want
to overclock either of them particularly
because of the temperatures we were
already hitting which is another
similarity between both cards 84 to 85
degrees Celsius of course we that's
where our our temperature slider in
afterburner was also set at and I feel
like if this cooler was able to keep
that GP 102 GPU just a little bit cooler
or maybe significantly cooler we'd
probably see the performance pull even
further ahead of the founders Edition
just because we'd have a little bit more
thermal Headroom and GPU boost would
kick in a little bit more extra
performance and speed up the frequency a
tad but that's unfortunately what we
were saying today not to say that this
is a bad card by any means but really
most people who are buying an admin
board card with a non blower style
cooler on it is probably going to expect
better temperatures than what you're
getting with the mini here so that's
something to be aware of you are hoping
for really cool temperatures in the mini
form factor that is not going to be the
case now because the GP is getting so
warm the fans have to spin up a little
bit faster and that makes the card a
little noisier in fact we're pretty much
getting around the same noise levels
with the founder's Edition on our mini
here if anything is actually a little
bit louder to be honest but not enough
to the point where you could even tell a
difference unless you did a straight-up
a B comparison which you guys can take a
listen of right now
at the end of the day I got to
appreciate the fact that ZOTAC has
somehow managed to cram a GP 102 into a
card that's significantly smaller than
the founders Edition equivalent at the
same time I do wish that the card was a
little bit quieter and a lot cooler and
I also wish that it performed a little
bit better than the founders Edition but
that being said if you guys are in the
market for as much power in as a little
space as possible well you don't really
have many other options at this point so
