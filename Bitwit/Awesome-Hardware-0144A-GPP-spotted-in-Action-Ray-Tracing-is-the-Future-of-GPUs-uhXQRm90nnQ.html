the show this is awesome hardware
episode 144 this is a tech news show
that Paul and I do every single Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right here and
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware we also
stream the show in its entirety to our
respective YouTube channels into two
halves today and just just contradict
yourself oh shit we stream it in
entirety it's entirely in half its
entirety
yeah sorry I'd really tired eat yes they
would have never noticed you would have
never noticed that you not pointed it
out though now the whole the ebb and
flow and the energy of the shows off and
it's gonna be a disaster but you know
I've had more than it usually I wanted
to get that out of the way so that the
rest of the show could be awesome that's
right I always start on a bad note so
what we learned today I take that home
with you guys but this is a fun show
it's pretty casual and relaxed we like
to have a beer or three on the show if
you're of legal drinking age feel free
to join us and drink responsibly of
course drink from your homes so you
don't drive anywhere trend ahead and
drink from your heart drinking your
heart and not not your head listen to
your what do your heart wants to drink
okay it's gonna stop there and what else
what else should I say about this show
we have we like to have fun occasionally
we'll have a potty mouth and we'll slip
a couple curse words in there so if you
have a blanket of sensitive hearing or
little ones around make sure that you
adjust your settings accordingly
additionally we saw stuff on our stores
so that we can generate a living and
continue doing what we do if you would
like to help in that cause feel free to
buy something from either of our stores
mine's bit wind-up tech slash store look
at all the stuff I'm so in hoodies
there's women shirts and more hoodies
and shirts and glasses the large 20
ounce glasses can fill lots of beer curd
deer loins they are very nice glasses
and I can't eat the glass I finally got
some for from my studio I'm so acceso we
can use them on the next episode finally
we have to resort to those stupid glass
little mugs that we got today did they
show up because you proactively
contacted John or did he actually just
catch us talking on the show about like
well we should really ask you
anyone ever proactive when it comes to
the stuff it's always John's so he saw
he apparently saw that self without
saying anything the glasses I love you
John so yes go ahead and stuff for my
sandals both of our stores my store is
pulsar bread dotnet where you can also
buy things there they all come from the
same place if you order from both of us
the same time it usually ships together
and if you buy stuff during the show
we'll give you a shout-out at the end of
each F will shout your name and Johnson
Jones and you'll get Johnson means that
you could get Johnson by two grown men
tonight just just keep that in mind
folks um so she was getting better every
minute it is that's how we work that's
how we want preach shout-out to cell
processing our moderators oh he's in
chat being being his his own damn self
yeah so um let's uh let's move on to
let's get on with the show yeah with our
first segment I thought I would switch
things up once again and start with a
pip my PC where we take a look at all
the submissions you guys have submitted
that's why they are submissions of your
own systems and these are every
submission that you see here folks is
just a cry for help
people are in need and and we're gonna
help them we're gonna give them what
they need
if by yelling at them and telling them
what they did wrong so first off we have
nilus bailiffs
Nilus with with a Z 370z motherboard
from Asus it's an asus rog board with an
i7 8700 k NZXT crackit X 62 ROG Strix
1080 TI very very nice hey she still
tried to Z and all that good stuff sy
were you reading that oh no it's another
rest of the specs don't matter we
already covered CPU GPU but let's see
okay a dark dark based pro 900 it's a
very nice case from be quiet it was the
official hardware canucks case of the
year for 2016 if I remember correctly
well well that's a gosh darnit nice
feather in their cap right what's you
for speaking honestly here the first
thing that stands out to me is I can't
work camera leave something to be
desired photography's a little washed
out here yes here we got a flash going
on yeah you don't use flash which is is
reflecting across a few parts of the
mothers drive for natural lighting you
know your images which makes it seem
very bright now here I feel like
everything's blue is that just is it a
is it a rainbow and he just caught the
picture during the worst worst blue
although LEDs are blue
oh you're right LEDs on the yeah the
motherboard the Kraken I would the
memory and the graphics either
coincidence like you said he just
happened to take it during some weird
strobing cycle or he just likes blue
LEDs which I mean why not Orange now
here we have orange grommet it does
require two separate software suites to
control these you need the cam software
for the Kraken and you can control
everything else with the Asus software
drum so he would have had to sync those
some way so maybe you just decided to go
with all blue for that reason yeah
that's possible whatever floats your
boat I would like to see it more yeah I
don't know it's not oh wait here's
here's another picture now it's yellow
and yellow yellow blue and orange okay
so I mean if it were up to me I would
keep it either like orange LEDs to match
because there's definitely a prominent
amount of orange in your case itself
yeah the accent color so I think that
would look really nice just have it sort
of like thematic but you know if you
want to switch things up that's fine if
you like it if you like that color combo
I'm not gonna fault you for it but apart
from the lighting I don't think the
power supply sticker is doing much for
you yeah it just looks a little it's red
to the text on that so that would that
would clean up your color scheme a
little bit and then that is glossy the
one on top it's just a much a text on
there so pulling that off might be good
now your kill management I definitely
approve of it's very clean everything's
tight in there you don't have any extra
loose loose thingy tangles hanging
around there so well well done there I
guess it's just maybe this is just the
place I feel like what the quality of
the part we're in here it's not like
blowing me away right right yeah but you
you got a solid build day I feel like
maybe just maybe just some different
pictures do some do some glamour shots
and then maybe fix up your your LEDs so
you catch them at the right time right I
don't know it's hard to do orange with
LEDs yeah that might be an option for
you
Ducati q Thank You nightless for sending
that over I said we've got Logan Logan
ball game with an i-5 6600 k 4.5
gigahertz a coolermaster liquid master
liquid light 120 gtx 1070 TI Duke
I believe that's from MSI and we have an
MSI gaming Pro carbon z170a motherboard
with 16 gigs of HyperX ddr4 2444 speed
all right
is that cooler master I'll go upside
down no no it's not okay it's right side
up which is great hey the cable
management shot we don't always see that
cable MGMT I think they are including it
those looks just fine to me fine as long
as the side panel gets on their cable
management on this side however could
maybe be a little bit neater I see a
couple cables dangling around that are
kind of stretching a little bit longer
than they might need to like a fan
connect a fan cable the top right of
your motherboard some of the cables that
are here yeah that just looks like it's
reaching right I mean it could have gone
through that grommet that's good ramen
there's a couple of cables coming over
here for the I guess is there front fans
maybe the AI oh right
it just looks like it's stretching over
you know trying to I know the candor
else looks pretty looks pretty tight
though
is that a cable underneath the graphics
card what is like coming from the
chipset oh he has a sound card or some
other riser card going over he's wired
underneath G okay that's most likely a
sound card cuz that's probably the h HD
audio right there yeah HDD audio cables
are notorious for allowing interference
and being crappy I would be somewhat
curious if you actually use your front
panel audio very often or your front
panel like headphone jacks right I mean
I didn't notice it at first really I
don't know I also I like here's here's
the nice don't worry we got that we got
the rear view here but we don't have a
picture with the side panel on because
that's what I'd be kind of curious to
see is what's covered up here I would be
somewhat in
clients like look you got some LEDs
shown in the corners here but I'm pretty
sure that's probably not visible when
the side panels on it's a Zalman case so
it's not a full window I've never met a
Zalman case that I liked yeah but this
one just from the internals doesn't look
terrible
yeah my basement at least this all build
up you know you got a nice choice of
hardware here and that's it's a very
nice gaming PC so yeah you go there I
don't know I don't have any immediate
suggestions for improving things other
than a couple of little cable issues
academician yeah I'm pretty much the
same okay
what's good good job Logan thank you for
your submission Kaito Kaito Kaito with a
AMD risin 5 1600 MSI X 370 gaming +
motherboard a team T force Vulcan ddr4
2666 he's got 8 gigs of that gigabyte
GTX 1063 gigabyte windforce d5 and he
says he's planning to buy a 250 gigabyte
960 Evo and about 2 SSD and sleeved the
power supply cables and some RGB I'm
glad you mentioned that thing about the
power supply cables because that was the
first thing I would have pointed out you
know the ketchup somehow matches here
because you do have red accents and your
other board but the mustard however it's
not quite quite as fortunate so there's
a purple in there - there's a purse yeah
not much can be done about the perps so
I think the system looks pretty good
overall it does look like you have some
LED fans at the front of your case which
you know from the outside you did give
us one external pic of your system all
lit up and stuff it looks really nice
actually
but and with a side panel on you
probably can't really see those front
fans anyway also really nice cable
mention on the back for like a budget
case like whoa
overachiever over here and yeah I think
once you sleeve those cables you're
gonna be in really good shape
you know it's a pretty simple build so
there's not a lot that we can ratite
here and looks like you've routed
everything properly as far as I can tell
I want to give a shout out to the little
like this is like carefully routed
yellow cables back here yeah like yeah
it just said it's kind of symmetrical
whatever like it it's like everything
here was done with purpose
yeah like everything's so purpose or
intention yeah
all right so I mean it seems like you've
already got a pretty good idea of what
you want to do next you know power
supply sleeve cables would obviously be
very nice and you got a red and black
theme so your RGB implementation is
gonna be somewhat limited by that but
you know there's there's ways to go
about that so yeah maybe we'll see it up
an update picture from you yeah those
cables steady cool
thank you management looks real clean
though all right yes you can that you
can buy on Paul's hybrid net this is
available right now Paul Harbor down net
Walterboro net high quality bottle
opener do it now opens all the bottles
screen was blue it's so easy so smooth
Wow I've been here all night with my
fingers beer tastes better man with okay
my confidence has been boosted careful
Armand Darius I'm suffering from
priapism now Thermaltake view 31
tempered glass RGB case and i-5 1600 X
at 4 gigahertz a EVGA ACL 280 CLC the
Thermaltake ring 14 fans asus prime X
370 pro motherboard and 82 128 gig em
that to SSD Samsung 850 Evo 250 Tara
hash - and 50th 50th SSD g.skill RGB
memory an EVGA 1080 for the win there
will take to fire 750 watt power spot ok
ooh here's the night here's the night
view ok one of these pictures is doable
alright so I'm gonna look at the non RGB
one first
ok I thought the LEDs that one okay yeah
I guess very that one yeah that lights
off yeah that's off first
ok because you know the LEDs could be
anything really so first order is here
it's a pretty color neutral system with
the exception of your graphics card
cables black and red is what you decide
to go with even though your ATX cables
are just sort of the rig
you know power supply cables so it's
kind of interesting I would say match
those up if you could maybe gets a ATX
extension as well look at all this
thermaltake ring garbage oh my gosh yeah
Paul and I were just having a discussion
right before we went live today that
adding RGB into your system just makes
things so much more complicated with
wiring stuff and controllers etc but it
looks like you know that everything is
wired properly like your cable
management looks pretty good on the
business end of things or on the front
end I would say that the hard drive
peeking out the top right looks kind of
distracting yeah the green PCB
definitely stands out there especially
with the light in this in this
particular shot yeah
trains really going to Tam on the horn
there I also find it interesting we have
it we have a power link here but we are
using the graphics cards in the vertical
position which still makes sense what
shrink puts the power link on the side I
guess it makes sense a little top
yeah that's we may be that it has yeah
so that's to me yeah that's true it is
interesting because you see more of the
power earlier you see the power link
from a complete like 90 degree offset
angle yeah then you then you normally do
and you really notice it a lot more
instead of instead of the power link
sort of blending in with the GPU becomes
more apparent when when it's mounted
vertically yeah so that's that is
interesting but it doesn't I would like
to see like I don't know I don't know
what your options are here for your
cable extensions of it because they're
so visible because they stand out so
much I just I like to see a more even
swoop yeah right they just they seem a
little tweaked and not like they they
just did their little overwrought to me
I feel like those could be redone
somehow I don't but that's really what's
standing out to me here other than that
you know your night shot here reveals
what you probably see most of the time
when the lights are off in the systems
on yeah it's pretty cool with all the
lights and a nice like a lit up case
it's very that's a good case for it it's
lit BAM
tempered glass side panel yeah I mean I
don't have too much too much else to add
yeah my power supply label could be
remove - yes yeah black that a little
bitty good power supply label parts boy
label the greens and get just put
something you can put a black piece of
plastic here I don't know something
that'll handle at least some warm
temperature behind the PCB for the hard
drive right and then maybe remove the
label or also do some other aesthetic
improvement on your a data SSD your
you'll m2 SSD there - yeah that would
clean things up for you hey Oh God for
some reason the video that I just posted
on YouTube is only buffered at 360p or
it's only at 360 P oh good so I'm gonna
make it private and I will upload it in
4k when I get home I mean literally I
mean did you wait for it to render yeah
well yeah it to process it uploaded
right when I left from your house from
your house
so that should at least be a 1080 no no
you don't think so depending on the
length of the video it's never taken
this long though it can they can get
stuck at 360 for a while sometimes okay
I've been I mean I haven't had it occur
to me to me happened to me too much man
I've heard from several people just on
Twitter and stuff like that about you do
processing sometimes sometimes taking to
take it out long for 4k but never from
like 360 to like but you didn't even 720
you didn't render it at 360 is I use if
you're worried about that you've
rendered it a lower resolution no I
definitely didn't it's definitely
there's definitely a 4k so maybe it's
just maybe you're right it's just taking
longer than usual alright so sorry
anyone who is in the middle of watching
the video if it just stopped randomly
shouldn't be watching that video anyway
she watching our live show yeah this is
an experience that you only get to
experience once a week that's true or
you can watch you know you can you can
multi stream us and gamers Nexus if
they're still streaming they're
overclocking world-record-breaking
ltte slapping live stream
that I heard was going on right now
subtle subtle plug for it I didn't hear
about that
no I am let's move on to Gabriel no we
just did Gabriel right did we do kiss
yes so Hermanson Hermanson Hermansen I
don't know okay
mr. h and i7 4770k a master licking 240
a io from coolermaster 16 gigs of ram
that leads to the saber-tooth z87
motherboard a gtx 750ti gaming from msi
a 550 watt corsair proud
power supply 2 terabyte sshd the Seagate
Barracuda you choose 2 and the fractal
design define C alright first look
reveals I was gonna say kill
management's looking not too bad with
this loop down here at the bottom
sticking out is great that looks
unnecessary and then and then there's
also a bit a bit extra at the top here
that might be unavoidable due to just
making sure you got all your plugs
connected for your the saber tooth I
forget I feel like there should only be
one supplemental CPU connector for that
but I I could totally wrong about that
you got ketchup and mustard power supply
cables which is always of course a no-no
for us or an easy thing to improve oh my
gosh this old-school Crucial Ballistix
memory i think i have a kid of that
still lying around somewhere
holy smokes i remember that these three
it's like yellow and match with nothing
pretty low profile this is nice
yeah it yeah difficult to match
definitely doesn't match with like your
graphics card and that's the thing if
you buy one of those MSI gaming cards
that you're kind of stuck with red in
your build some degree right here oh
here I was upset about something so it's
gonna be a right here oh thank you I'm
not too sure but I know I know our shows
not when it was interesting to listen to
that they know try to have some manners
so yeah I mean I would just sort of try
to color coordinate that a little bit
more if you could
it matches with the label in the power
supply but they can't see those rowdy
but he can't see them but at the same
time
oh this Coolermaster AIO is upside down
it is water block so that could be which
I'm not sure why was because it actually
makes the hosing yeah it seems like it
stretches the hose a little bit so yeah
rotating that 180 degrees might be a
possibility for you and if and if you
want to bring you even closer you could
like put the radiator fans on the other
side of the radiator yeah I feel like if
you flipped it though that would give it
enough slack that that I do too yeah
yeah yeah so interesting interesting
choice there that's that's all I guys
that's I mean looks pretty good I'm not
fixed that weird cable loop and get some
extensions it's got a Vardar fins on
that colormaster
rip rip anyone who has ears and then
finally we have an honorable mention
Thank You Hermanson Hermanson
mispronounce through your name duck
crafty duck I just want to give a shout
out to to him or her it looks like him
because his PC looks pretty badass and I
thought you deserved an honorable
mention i with an asus z170 hero 6700 k
mmm-hmm when she's overclocked a 4.7
gigahertz and Astrix gtx 280 IOC very
nice and he has a lot of carbon fiber
work done in here but he's customized
everything from the power supply to the
actual like motherboard tray that he
sort of covered up partially it looks
really nice looks pretty pretty well
done it looks like at just a panel that
he custom cut inserted there yeah I
don't think that's part of the case no
definitely not
this is the dark Bass Pro 900 yeah dark
bass 900 or something like that I like
see this is this is a good example of
like having all your fans match up and
even be positioned in the same
orientation
it's a nice clean finish some very nice
looks to hold that shot we gotta
appreciate that too everything's looking
very clean there oh yeah
and yeah here's a null so like to point
out the the trend of power supply shreds
being pretty pretty common these days I
don't mind seeing this part of a power
supply right when it's looking like this
exactly right you know yeah I mean yeah
you definitely got to put in a little
bit more legwork to make your power
supply area look good but when it does
if you do that then it looks just as
good as any other part of your system I
agree so good job nice going
crafty duck and that concludes pimp my
PC for today thank you everyone who
submitted let's move on to our next
segment which is ask the audience we
will be asking you guys some questions
you'll be taking some polls answering
honestly as honest as the Internet can
be and Paul I will guess what you've
answered will ressort of figure out how
well we know you guys and then whoever
gets the farthest away answer to being
correct will have to die a horrible
death or they can just drink some beer
if they want to opt for that instead we
leave up calls we'll leave it to them
lived a nation will cross that bridge
when we come to it I guess indeed so our
first question is about Nvidia's GPP the
infamous GPP which we'll talk about more
right we shall I actually haven't looked
into this that much at least
beyond last week you know they're the
recent developments right I'm relying on
you to yes we'll be talking more about
that on my half the show so stay tuned
for that but the first question here is
would you boycott would you actually
boycott nvidia gpus if they moved
forward with their GPP the geforce
partners program that's what it stands
for right geforce partner program so um
yeah for those of you unfamiliar the
good ol penis process in a nutshell GPP
is this program that Kyle Bennett from
heart OCP first
sort of wrote an article on before
anybody else did because he talked to
some added board partners and people
like that and kind of got the idea that
in video is planning this program we're
select adding board partners could opt
in to be a part of it and we'd get
special treatment in terms of marketing
and GPU inventory allocation and a bunch
of other things if they aligned their
top-of-the-line gaming brands
specifically with Nvidia and all AMD
cards would have to go under some other
subpar brand that wasn't asus rog or
gigabyte or as' or msi gaming it had to
go under some other sub brand that
wasn't quite as appealing to the the
mainstream market so it's very
controversial and so my question is and
as I've read like threads and different
forum posts about this are you laughing
about the last option
no one choose that option it's not it's
not real so that's what can I say that
don't think either probably can't be
used now so I don't know what do you
think about this ball what do you think
our audience weren't even our audience
lies when it comes to the GBP and how
far they're willing to go to show how oh
sorry says how much they disapprove of
this move from AMD or Nvidia sorry so
your new link did it apparently you
can't post strawpoll links directly in
youtube chat when did that happen
what I don't know so season it sells
cell has bit lead it for us oh wow
that's nice geez thank you so I clicked
on the most recent bitly link and brick
broke this drop all good lord
all right thanks thanks for your taking
Kevin so you can if you want you can
handle the other pull links as well
that'd be awesome
so Paul where do you stand on this where
do you think our audience stands on this
specifically
like the spirits will say yes but the
reality will say no yeah that's my
that's probably why I met on that one
yeah cuz I mean it's also they're more
more details forthcoming of course but
at least based on we talked about last
week there was still some question as to
how egregious this actually is and what
limitations they're actually placing on
the vendors are working with when it
comes to other partners namely AMD
Radeon so you know it could be something
that's being blown out of proportion it
could be something that is really
seriously like a crappy thing and that
is an injury so that hurts consumers and
gamers or it could be someplace
somewhere in the middle and probably
gotta wait and see a little bit more to
for what actually have you but I like to
like I like to come from a place of like
they just because having an ideal or a
principal or something that's like a you
know something that's perfect like right
just because we know that's not
attainable doesn't mean that shouldn't
be something that that we strive towards
I'm trying to be deep here so point
being I'd like to say that if in video
was to do this and it was detrimental to
customer experience or the amount of
choice we have or the price that we're
paying for graphics cards not that can
get much worse but whatever I'd like to
think that people on the room the
principal would say no that's stupid and
crappy and we're gonna you know speak
with our wallets and yeah whatever I
don't actually see that happening but
yeah okay I'm probably in the same boat
I would I'm probably still gonna buy
nvidia gpus okay before we see what the
audience thought about that one let's
quickly take a look at the next question
and we'll post that burden we post that
in chat hopefully - what's gonna get
sorry if someone said Kyle join GPP and
all he got was a hoodie
oh yeah you obviously yeah you got me
paid shills sellout damn her here I with
his nvidia dollar bills i can't believe
i with his his jensen bucks yeah if I
have the Jenson bucks this this would be
made of Nvidia should start like its own
cryptocurrency call it envy coin or envy
coin yeah that work oh god you'd be so
envious of all the people of the envy
coins right right yeah
duel me oh my god it's like that club in
Vegas every what's a cool day nvm so
envious T that's weird envy other people
nd oh oh my god I'm so jealous that's
why I feel okay hey describe how I feel
about you right now okay
but I digress point being the words
already talked about mmm envy coin let's
talk about coming out currency you can
move on to our next question
oh yeah well so the next question is
half and you shut down your PC yeah this
one's pretty straightforward yeah
everyone everyone vote on that yes and
means and let's let's go back to the
results here what's your boycott nvidia
gpus okay
no yeah GPP is messed up but they make
good GPUs Wow
so that's a that's half the voters right
there yeah 51% actually just over half
yep they have a majority
realistic choice oh yeah that's that's
realistic yeah but I mean surprisingly
like a third of people are saying yeah
they're not gonna they're not gonna
stand for and they're not gonna support
a business that's gonna be anti-consumer
if they end up going that route which
you know I feel like the surveys are
just surveys right and when volta comes
out it's like oh we're good and AMD's
options are
we'll see well we'll do this poll again
maybe and see if anything changes but
it's nice to see the enthusiasm and the
support or the anti support I should say
for the program and I'm like Paul said
there's a lot of details that's love yet
to come to light that could sway our
emotions one way or another so so you
you won this one right I didn't really
give him a straight up answer one way or
the other I kind of okay then we'll both
drink i wuold all right
we both copped out Cheers yes I would
enter choose it being an issue now oh no
we didn't drink beer no no runtime okay
so how often do you shut down your PC if
you asked this before I think that's a
similar question to this before but it
is a good maybe they have it's a good
question though
oh yeah again here I can't give a direct
answer because I have multiple computers
right and I have those eaters in your
house there's one or two of them that no
I'm sorry the htpc always stays on
that's really interesting because right
now cuz it's it's that's the plex server
is on they speaking of which where's the
HTPC video Paul I'm doing I'm doing no
I'm doing a video I know I don't know
this week hmm
no it sounds like something you said
five months ago no but I actually had a
good idea for that's right well I can't
wait to see it I'm sure it's gonna be
you me it's gonna be awesome
yes that stays on all the time okay
no what about like your daily driver
like the one that you're on for you know
most of the time I know it's hard to
figure out what your the times this
computer is a streaming pcs like what
I'm on when I'm out here working and
like I'll use it to play music or to
look capture video that's a good one
let's use that what I'm gonna game it's
on arctic panther right which I haven't
really done much of recently which kind
of sucks but you know and then if I'm
doing like email or
like I guess everything else goes on the
computer in the computer room right it's
different vibe in there yeah very like
that more of an office and this is more
like a workspace again yeah uh anyway so
but yeah I do try to shut down most of
them cuz I don't know saves a little
power I guess she's lots of a concern if
you're done if you're just putting him
to sleep cuz that's a pretty little
power draw anyway right um yeah that's
what I usually do I usually put my
system to sleep I haven't shut it down
like a really long only shut it down if
it like needs to be shut down like it
starts acting out and I'm like you know
have you tried turning it off and on
again type of thing and the stupid thing
is with Windows 10 now like a shutdown
isn't shut down anymore shutdown is a
soft off and restart is the only thing
that actually does it actually does a
real restart what what yes as a win as
of Windows 10 wait shutting down your
computer doesn't actually shut it down
I've never heard about this yeah it's I
have to pull up an article audit or
something to get into specifics but yeah
I'll be damned
well I'm reaching for the power supply
switch now if you should do is you want
to actually do a an actual restart on a
Windows 10 computer you need your like
ever just what what yeah that's true
some people like yes thank you cure cRIO
when fastboot is enabled Oh ask boots me
yeah because when you shut down it wants
to be able to turn back on really
quickly in order to turn on quickly was
that you start will actually wash
everything and do it do like a yeah gold
shine well you learn something new every
every day I mean more you and anyone who
chat who's like oh my gosh what the hell
is this it's the same exact reaction for
me and this went and this wasn't
necessarily like like right when Windows
10 washed it took a while before I
actually found that out I don't really
baby okay
we do boot fast now I mean yeah booting
up quickly so that's that's cool alright
so I guess we can move on to our
last question or should we skip it
because we're we have some a lot of
stuff left sorry what was next let's
let's let's just get the last question
okay
Sal hold off on the last question ask
the audience we'll just jump jump into
the results for under the new for the
for the straw poll give two more
segments list but it's it's just it's
more like I guess it's like an extended
okay it's just one segment justices 60%
59% Daly shut down the computer when
they go to sleep wow that's more than I
thought that's a lot more than I thought
I thought quarter say only when they're
afk for a few days or more and 16% are
with you with the never just that's the
half inch layer of dust that covers the
power button hmm I'm in the second
category myself yeah yeah if I'm going
on a weekend trip or something I'll
actually powered down other than that I
just go to sleep well but now that after
this now that I know I'm actually not
powering it down I'm just putting it in
some weird very low-level idle state
that I mean it's to power up it's not
it's not like it still uses less power
to shut down versus versus sleep from my
understanding yeah but yeah so this is
another one that neither of us really
picked it side on right yeah not really
okay
we both drink Cheers groovy
a little something extra that's means
there's like I think there's like 2%
more alcohol in these beers it's like
they added a shot disappear this isn't
brilliant it's like free free booze all
right moving on to our next segment this
is kind of yes and it's an extension of
the news our segment that we'll be
talking about later on but there is a
huge announcement across multiple
companies about ray tracing so this
segment is called RTS not real-time
strategy but ray tracing stuff is what
it stands for
unfortunately down the lower thirds I
ran at a time I was gonna make one you
know I mean we're not even like partners
yeah
not even twitch partners so the idea
that we would actually make a lower
thirds graphic for our show so so
outside the realm of possibility I guess
or you know pausing and do on the fly
fuck it we'll do a live we'll do it live
I could I could show everyone - yeah
alright so what Paul shows you guys his
little Oriole will put some little BTS
do you get this one for free guys you
get this one for free positive do little
BTS here I'm gonna just jump into all
this ray-tracing stuff which is
coincidentally the name of our segment
today I have to i forgot i did this so a
couple companies i think it all started
with microsoft that GDC they announced
that they would be implementing
ray-tracing support into DirectX 12 and
this is huge this is big news because
ray tracing is is the technology that we
see in like Michael Bay movies where
they have like photorealistic imagery
that looks just so so good it looks so
good
look so good we want now on and now we
have this sort of window that's been
opened to implement this technology into
games via real time ray tracing which up
until now has just been so incredibly
taxing on existing GPU architecture but
companies like AMD and NVIDIA are aiming
to change that now that Microsoft is
sort of implemented support for amazing
technology that will take the graphical
fidelity of gaming as we know it to the
next level it's very exciting stuff I'm
excited I'm super stoked I mean this is
like the quantum leap that we've been
waiting for I think and obviously it's
gonna take probably a decade plus for it
to really be you know refined and
finessed and for the architecture for
the technology on the hardware side to
really keep up with it but essentially
the way ray-tracing works in a very
high-level sense and you can you should
probably read the Symantec article
for a better you're standing but just
really high level it basically creates
it's a method used to create images by
tracing rays or paths of light as they
bounce off of an object or several
objects and in the scene and so this
creates like a photo realistic image
with shadows that are correctly casts
reflections in water are completely like
pretty much one-to-one with real-life
think everything is and I think one of
these articles has like yeah we gotta
lower Thursday oh also sort of beautiful
and use the same the same iRobot image
or whatever yes as whatever was in there
before which was like a I don't tend to
mess with that kind of thing I gotta get
the point across somehow it kind of
works because it looks like a really
nice graphic yeah imagine that guy's
name is Ray he's probably a robot named
Ray and he's been traced tracing he's
tracing his rounds as as illustrated
here yeah
view ray I mean that's Ray's head right
there so I mean basically this is more
more lifelike everything more lifelike
scenery more lifelike smoke explosion
effects pretty much anything you can
imagine
and it all has to sort of do with
lighting and just how how the lighting
is recreated in a 3d rendered image and
it sort of emulates how the human eye
works but in Reverse if that makes sense
because in in real life you know light a
light source let's say the Sun it
bounces off objects objects first and
then that goes into our eyes and and
then we interpret that whatever with the
phone the technology neurons do the
Botox yes that's the word I was looking
for but this sort of works in Reverse
where the lighting is traced these paths
are traced from the camera angle from
the viewers eyes out to the objects and
then bounced off of the objects on to
other objects in the environment to
create a again a photo realistic image
again really an antique article it
doesn't much better explaining at these
things than I do but the long short of
it is that Microsoft has implemented
port for this technology into direct x12
which might be like the the core
technology we've all been waiting for
with this new API with more or less new
API I mean DirectX 12 was you know we've
been talking about it for like four
years now there's some games it's been a
while since we've talked about it very
well and this could be like the big
thing that it needs to really be a game
changer I think and so Microsoft my
computer shutting down why I hate no
because they don't have employment why
aren't your battery cuz I forgot the the
charging cable and I was gonna ask you
if I could borrow the one from your
razor blade charging fake and then okay
it's not here okay so while Paul gets
that more more BTS stuff you should just
carry like a like a little webcam so
that people can watch you know what
Paul's doing wait what
you gave me an extended one I thought
that was mine I did not steal it anyway
d XR is Direct X ray tracing is what
Microsoft announced at GDC and it's a
universal sort of standard part of their
API where developers can now all
integrate this technology into their
games I stole that yes like I like I
just took it from you because I let you
borrow I haven't seen two of those at my
office alright and I had a one that was
longer
Elson junior thank you for the power
real friends give other friends power
that works yes more beer
so this is really exciting Nvidia
announced that they were on board with
their r-tx
I think it's RT x I don't know ray
tracing whatever their initiative their
efforts to bring real-time ray tracing
to two games really and it's
super exciting and the other thing is
that rate racing isn't this whole
initiative with DirectX and Nvidia AMD
it's not trying to replace the existing
method of rendering in fact it's
actually sort of trying to coexist or
work very closely alongside traditional
rasterization so that because
rasterization is more much more
efficient right then real-time ray
tracing that takes a lot of freaking
burden it taxes the hardware so hard
that you can't do that 100% of the time
so the way that they're trying to make
this possible with like existing or
future GPU architecture is that you're
only ray tracing certain parts of a
scene that are absolutely necessary and
you're filling the rest of the blanks in
with rasterization so it's kind of like
the two go hand-in-hand right you're
gonna have
rasterization and ray tracing working
alongside each other in real time so
that you get the best of both worlds
amazing imagery with photorealistic
pictures but not to the point where it's
it's just crushing your system and it
can't handle it so it's actually pretty
cool okay great everything still is
running fuck you being that is good yeah
yeah it's Nvidia r-tx as they mentioned
anything else that I missed here AMD
announced that they're you know
supporting ray tracing for their Pro
render rendering engine and radeon GPU
profiler 1.2 it's gonna be focused on
game and graphical development Radeon
Pro render will bring support for mixing
real-time ray tracing with traditional
rest rasterization as I mentioned for
greater computational speed though
they're supposed to release a press
press they're supposed to be you I'm
sorry they're supposed to be a press
release I thought was supposed to be
today but maybe it's tomorrow with more
details from AMD specifically on how
they plan to implement these changes so
this is all to say that we could be
looking at a crucial point in history of
of graphical quality bulken in PC gaming
being taken to the next level which is
super exciting so that's all I want to
say about that I'm not the best
authority
to talk about all the ins and outs of
the technology but it's coming and
that's exciting and I should also
mention that Nvidia said that this
ray-tracing stuff will first be
introduced to Nvidia the Nvidia only
only only only a video gets to render
pixels photon technology but they will
only be are going to start implementing
it with Volta the Volta architecture so
but that's not to say that your existing
DirectX 12 cards won't be able to handle
the real-time ray tracing but I think
it's gonna be more optimized for a Volta
architecture onwards we're talking about
Nvidia specifically but your mileage
that your performance mileage will vary
based on which architecture you're using
as well so again more details to follow
very fun stuff let's move on to our news
of the day starting with this was just a
reddit post that I found in the in the
hardware subreddit but reddit it's
showing basically the the post was
saying like hey it looks like in videos
GPP is already in action or it's at
least taking it's taking effect in some
very sneaky ways this was posted by
redditor evern essence and he basically
is like linking a lot of his findings
here and findings from other people in
the community that it seems like
gigabyte MSI and asus when you look at
their manufacturers site or different
retailers that gammas on Newegg are have
already started this sort of GPP
behavior where AMD cards are being
stripped of the ROG Strix the Auris the
gaming X branding in various ways so
there's there's other links here that
I've provided and whatnot where you can
see that like on an amazon product page
it still says ROG Strix in the titling
but if you look at the packaging and the
card itself there's no branding of that
to be to be seen it's completely
stripped of it hey Zeus we have the
Radeon corner right yeah but there's no
ROG there's no strict there's no
owl like the owl with the big eyes and
stuff it's completely gone they've
removed it from all the stickers and
logos which is somewhat suspicious to
say the least
and that goes you know just the same for
MSI on their on their global website
it's missing the gaming branding for
their RX 5 80s 5 70s and 5 60s gigabytes
website has also removed horas branding
from AMD cards and ironically switched
it to gaming which is what MSI typically
uses but still it's not a part of there
under there or ass umbrella so I mean
and if I were to guess which ad board
partners were to be a part of this
program the first three companies would
be these ones a CS gigabyte Nemus I'd
they're the three ones that move the
most volume exactly and also who work
with both with both team red and team
green yeah so so it's kind of like shit
you know I mean I don't know I mean it's
it's weird and here's the other sketchy
thing is that if this is if this does
have anything to do with the GBP it's
kind of sketchy that it's already
happening without us having like more
broad details about what it is well this
isn't like some things Nvidia does and
like big companies do where they want to
talk about it and they want to publicize
it and they want people to know about it
if they're doing something like this and
it's something that the public wouldn't
be happy or wouldn't have a positive
reaction to then it's probably something
that if they're still gonna do it
they're gonna do it and try to kind of
sweep it under the rug Greg just do it
and have it happen and nobody notices
yeah if Andy becomes aware of this which
is my this is my assumption based on
just stuff we've heard about it over the
past couple weeks and the fact that when
Kyle and hardware CP did his article he
said very straightforward like AMD
approached me with this story first of
all he didn't think there was enough to
it at the time but he followed up and
did more background research by working
with different contacts that he has
within the industry
the story that he'd uncovered was such
that he felt he had to write the article
that he wrote and expose it on a larger
scale so if this is happening right now
then maybe it was evidence that AMD saw
it happening and tried to bring it to
light but if it's already in the works
by the time AMD hears about it and tips
off Kyle and Kyle does this research and
you know weeks or go by or whatever then
maybe this is the results and definitely
seeing graphics cards listed without the
word gaming on the graphics card isn't
something that you see that often like
graphics cards usually have gaming
somewhere in the title so I don't know I
don't know if we're gonna get any public
acknowledgement or statements or
anything like that from any of these
companies
because nvidia obviously probably is
just gonna want to ignore it and wait
for it to die down and go away the
companies are working with are probably
under contractual obligation not to
speak about it so all you're really
gonna hear about it it's probably this
type of thing and us discussing it on
shows like this and we can't even tell
you for sure right whether this is just
people pulling stuff and trained to
create a story of something that already
existed and they're just manufacturing
something or this is actually the result
of GPP right we don't know that for sure
and it could just boil down to you know
the fact that Nvidia is just gonna keep
this under wraps and and even though
like we'll all be able to infer and
figure out like what's happening
no company or adding board partner will
ever go on record and be like yeah it's
actually happening wherever confirm
what's going on and I feel like that's
that's kind of a it's an interesting
situation because I feel like everyone
who already knows what they're buying
like everyone who knows like tech and
hardware in the PC space they're already
gonna know what what Nvidia and what AMD
are offering in terms of their silicon
and their GPUs and whatever branding
that Nvidia is trying to sway is not
gonna really affect
the the salesmen but at the same time
it's it's kind of like this unspoken
it's kind of like a secret like a secret
cult that they're like pulling the
strings behind the scenes and you know
no one's really ever confirmed that it
exists but based on what you see and and
here you kind of can can can guess I
don't know it's I'm really curious to
see how much this actually surfaces is
GPP ever gonna like come out are they
ever gonna like come out of the closet
and be like yes we're here we exist or
is it just gonna be this forever like
speculation where we're just like it
seems like it really does exist I think
no one's ever said or confirmed that it
does probably though probably not right
because it's the partner program it's
made for partners of NVIDIA GeForce
right and that's not us or any of you
guys which kind of sucks because it
technically has you know on paper it has
nothing to do with the consumer but in
reality it does affect the consumer in
many ways I would think possibly
possibly so I don't know I'm not calling
Nvidia gay stop it chat stop it getting
off task ok so that's that let's let's
put it aside for now and move on to our
next article which is about was from a
man tech there was a power outage at the
Sampson fab destroyed three point five
percent doesn't sound like a lot but
three point five percent of the global
NAND flash output for March for this
month alone when I first read this I I
read it as power outage destroys three
point five percent of global NAND flash
just in general worldwide oh Jesus oh
geez like any SSD you own is now three
point five percent but see tax rate on
it because of this failure just how I
read and more than three point I'm more
expensive so there was a thirty minute
power outage this is insane this is just
gives you a
idea of how massive Samsung's fad here
is in Pyongyang Tech South Korea a 30
minute power outage halted production
and damaged tens of thousands of
processed wafers that's you know
apparently up to 3.5 percent of the
global NAND supply for this month in
March and that potentially might mean
higher flash memory pricing and coming
weeks we don't know yet
hopefully not it's already high enough
as it is how much is three point five
percent of one man and has been slightly
more reasonable than prices have been
coming down but by a bit so yeah and and
like who knows if you know hopefully it
all just continues on and this doesn't
get affected but three point five
percent of one month's global man supply
is about 50 anywhere from 50 to 60,000
wafers global in supply from this from
Samsung yes but Samsung is a big player
so yeah they're huge this is their fab
here that we're talking about is
actually one of the largest in the world
so wonderful said like I'm just I'm just
curious the the the vitals as far as
like how the power outage affected the
wafers I have to imagine it has
something to do with temperature I mean
I mean think about all these wafers are
moving on an assembly line yeah and if
any part of that process gets disrupted
to the point where you know it's a
half-ass job you can't just like reset
it and the error is very assembly line
right yeah so anyway any of those wafers
that were on the assembly line are
locked for the most part so I mean the
the bright side is that Samsung
reportedly has a stockpile of NAND chips
just on hand which they can use to
fulfill any short-term shipments for the
month any any other commitments they've
gotten and that hand they got named on
hand that's their motto and they've
already produced enough Galaxy S 9 and s
9 plus units for the next coming months
so that's all good they don't have to
worry about that so hopefully this is
just like a little fluke given we're not
gonna see any increased pricing form and
specifically this bean and it was B NAND
flash memory but all these wafers were
carrying
and unfortunately the production lines
themselves haven't been damaged and the
fabs all back up online and it was just
the wafers themselves that were kind of
kind of compromised no damage to the
machinery no damage to the machinery
right that would have definitely put a
damper in things a lot more is there any
more beer everything
yours is oh oh shit yeah can I get one
of those classic Paul's hardware openers
why certainly you can pay to our cast
Hardware done it why thank you okay
moving on
an antic also has told us about AMD and
partners slashing prices on select yes
good news damn it prices are falling on
select rise and CPUs everyone rejoice
this is good if you know you're looking
for a deal and the reason why these
discounts are coming around right now is
because rising 2 is on the rise
unattended I think in April April
something anyway I think well this oh oh
we're at liberty to say is April right
now if you April so they have confirmed
it's next month the second gen rising
will be coming to store shelves and so
right now until the end of March we get
some pretty nice discounts on select
rise and CPUs this includes just
mainstream rising as well as resin
thread Ripper
so 1950 X for example is discounted from
$9.99 to 869 there are some like I said
rising CPUs that just aren't discounted
whatsoever like the risin 5 1600 which
is one of their best sellers if not the
best seller in the mainstream platform
so that's not there but everything else
the in 2007 line up 20 $20 discounts on
the 6 and 8 cores up here yep a 10 or
$15 discounts on your 4 cores down here
mm-hmm not on the AP use those those the
G SKUs are not eligible hey these are
new and
is there new yeah exactly and they don't
really compete too much with the other
with second gen rise and that's coming
out next month but some nice deals if
you want to snag something you know get
a new twenty thirty bucks off of select
CPUs this is something to be you can
take advantage of this is with
participating retailers including Amazon
Newegg Micro Center and Fry's it's kind
of unclear at this point whether the
campaign is global or only applies to
the confirmed countries of the United
States Canada UK and France I find this
to be a reasonable marketing technique
because people are aware that rise in to
is coming out people are in a situation
right now or they're like oh should I
buy now or should I wait mm-hmm
this is probably reflective of the price
drops that we would see on their eyes
and trip chips after rising to launches
anyway exactly making it happen trying
to parent it yep cool they're smart they
know marketing and then finally for
today's news we have an article from
hexxus about the smallest vr gaming rig
you've ever seen in fact it's part of
Intel's nook which I just learned from
this article I feel really dumb this
pronounced nook and not nook I've been
calling it nook for ages and they're
like no it's an acronym and the
pronunciation is next unit connected
okay
well but they made it seem very
objective so I was WOW okay okay I mean
if they're based in the UK they're very
really know you continue air about their
pronunciation of things from and then
sometimes they put the emphasis on the
wrong syllable but Intel published some
close-up photos of the Hades Canyon
motherboard there it is beautiful very
visible you can see the core i7 8 SKU G
processors we don't know exactly what
kind of coffee like ski we're getting
here but it's a definitely an 8 SKU with
some Radeon Vega graphics this is a
graphics with the HBM yak yes exactly so
it's got the HBM stack and very
prominently seen right there on the PCB
it's gonna be able to handle VR folks
the smallest VR gaining
you could possibly get your hands on
coming up in a spring of this year there
are two models that will be offered with
this particular device we've got the
Nook 8i seven hvk which is based on
unlocked core i7 eighty eight zero nine
G which is a four core eight thread SKU
with a max core clock a 4.2 gigahertz
with radio and rx Vega mg GH graphics
and then we have the nook 8i 7 H NK as
opposed to the hvk which uses an i7 87 0
5g which is also 4 cores 8 threads you
get that it's all the same but it's 100
megahertz slower at 4.1 gigahertz with
Radeon rx Vega m GL graphics so the
graphics chip is different slightly
slower slightly different and slower CPU
and those will retail for 940 and 770 US
dollars respectively
so upwards upwards of a grand for the
flagship model which you know given the
size and and and you know based on how
well it performs especially if you want
to take VR on the go I think that's what
I'm thinking I'm catching some of the
English people who have offended in
Czech it's ok oh god you've got the
Brits on your ass now shit that was a
being serious so so yeah I mean I think
this is pretty exciting stuff the fact
that we're able to push VR with a unit
so small I think it opens the doors in
some ways for VR as opposed to just
always having to be at your house or
some fixed location this kind of like
allows like the possibility of mobile VR
like if you want to take VR to a
friend's house you could just put this
in your pocket you wouldn't have to haul
your entire system or whatever let me
get like a flip out you know portable
monitor or something like that
and I think the lighthouse is if we're
talking about the vibe specifically
would be the biggest challenge at that
point is how do you you know take your
your life
or your sensors or whatever from your
home and install them at your buddy's
place but you know what they buddy
everybody should just have the
lighthouses set up already if he if he
doesn't he's not a real buddy and you
should find new friends because he sucks
picking a VR speedy Bri we're going to
talk about the HTC vive pro over on my
half of awesome partner friggin well
shit I was trying to do a segue that was
a great segue okay so let's move on to
our final donations and Johnson's so

unable to watch night but because Yolo
here is money enjoy my youtube if you
like human pups I don't know if I like
if I mean the human pups

of dogs who pups stand there but if
anyone would like to explore what human
pups are you can check out pup Shepherds
YouTube channel thank you very much pup
for the donation very generous of you
sir
hope you have a good evening des Jones
$5 what are your thoughts on the galaxy
1080 1070 TI hall of fame do you think
it would do well on 1440p resolution
absolutely yes even handle ultra wide
1440p no problem yeah I mean I love my
galaxy 1070 galaxy I and the hall of
fame cards Galax does a pretty good job
with they over build them they do really
good with the power delivery you know
it's just a shirt card it's just a shame
that you can't find them more they're
not quite as accessible in the US yeah I
had to buy mine from their actual
manufacturer website which you know had
to pay top dollar for it then it took
like two weeks to arrive but totally
worth it if you can do it Scott Dilbeck
six dollars and 66 cents Rock thank you
very much Scott
appreciate it sir Paul yes how are the
dogs this is from Scott doesn't get
Paddy's day drinking game video was
hilarious and the editing was on point
thank you very much it took 12 hours to
edit so I'm glad someone noticed yeah
but yeah it was a fun video pighead
x100 what is this SEK what what currency
is this where is he from
piggy deluxe SEK Singapore no Swedish
Krona Swedish viadon which is different
from Norwegian kroner well yeah latish I
would think so there are two different
countries so Swedish Krona I'll take
I'll take some Swedish Krona I'll take
any of that Cronus Sweden in Norway it
was a mixed emotion crota American Crona
which also sounds like time Crona like
chronotron like Kronos Swedish Krona
trigger it was a Swedish video ok no man
so anyway um thank you very much for the
donation Pigot hi Kyle and Paul today is
my 26th birthday happy birthday happy
birthday you two are my top three
youtubers who the fuck is number one
that's okay
I'm not jealous I'm listening on my
phone everyday not killable you guys
what you guys will keep my workdays
going I don't know what I'd do without
you guys well thanks Deluxe I appreciate
the fact that we're your number two and
three I do too not salty I don't mind
being number two so when you're number
one everyone's getting for you yeah when
you're number two no one cares because
you're the first loser when you're
number two you're the shit about that
all right David Oh Lavar is for the 15
bucks I have a rig with an FX 6300 16
gigs of RAM Asus m59 9 FX Pro are 2.0
gtx 660ti times 2 which would indicate
that would indicate sli would you
recommend i upgrade to an AMD FX 8350 or
perhaps an FX 95 90 i don't gain much
but I'd like to
I would not upgrade to either of those I
would upgrade to rise it I would swap
your system out your FX 6300 for
something like a risin 5 1600
it's not on sale currently as we just
discussed but it's still a really good
bang for the buck value and that would
get you on to the latest architecture
that developers are currently optimizing
their games around no one's note
helpers like how do we make this game
perform really well on an FX 95 90
that's that's the thing of the past it's
a little bit dated at this point you gtx
660ti is I'm sure a great an SLI but at
the end of the day I would probably
upgrade to something like the GTX 1060
maybe a 1070 then again GPU prices are
abhorrent so if you can find a good deal
on any 10 Series card or maybe an RX
Vega 56 dare I say then go for something
like that a good luck on whatever you
decide to do those are my two cents El
Jefe reviews ah five dollars when will
we see a Kyle versus Paul stack attack
oh that is a great quick I saw this
question earlier and I should stay state
for the record and to be very clear Kyle
has invited me to do stack attack
multiple times now I've been diligent
Inc probably like three three different
times you make me feel like a desperate
ho no no no that's not what I'm trying
to do what I'm trying to say is it's
completely my fault that I have not
participated in stack attack I've
watched stack attack it looks like fun
I'm totally dented participate Kal's
invited me I have had to decline on
multiple occasions for multiple
different reasons so I'm sorry I haven't
participated but I plan to in the future
and and and whyphy sauce will be very
grateful that you sign on every single
episode so that would be really fun to
offer you a challenge to be super cool I
looking forward to something like that
we'll make it happen thank you very much
El Jefe for the donation David Dunham
ten bucks
hello thanks for the great videos you
you're welcome David thank you very much
we appreciate the support
Matthew deal or dial not sure $5 hey
Paul thanks for recommending the
lumberyard to me while I was in
California oh it's delicious the
restaurant yeah that's us
I'm never late it's in Laguna yeah
that's where my my friend works and it's
like okay yeah oh nice and your
lumberyard now I don't know it's a
higher end restaurant it's it's like
Laguna it's it's a it's a it's a nice
area like they have in art oh yeah it's
a name in our community but like if you
guys have ever watched
oh gosh why brain for look you know curb
no no rest of the moment Arrested
Development summer I knew that's what
you were guess Arrested Development's in
the first two three seasons they go and
they take part in the art the art
festival thing which I'm also forget in
the name of Sunday it's like live it's
like life they recreate masters pageant
of the Masters I got you bro I got you
the bastards anyway that's all right
down in that same malaria yeah
lumberyard is a restaurant this part
that's just right there okay you know
it's it's not a chain or anything that's
cool well thank you very much Matthew
for that donation in question
Aidan lad with the ten Australian I
believe building a new gaming setup in
shortly motherboard Asus prime X 370 pro
CPU AMD risin 5 1600 X Ram Kingston 16
gigs 2 by 8 gig HyperX ddr4 2400 and GPU
is Asus GeForce GTX 960 should I
changing not really yeah I mean it looks
pretty solid to me yeah and you know
it's obviously gonna depend on your
needs are you gaming at 1080 or 4k with
a 1060 I'd say you're good with 1080 or
even 1440 to a certain degree and yeah I
mean the only thing I would want 6 gigs
in that as long as it's a 1066 big it's
a 1066 cake better frame times I could I
could see that build working with the
better with a higher-end graphics card
but you're probably dealing with the GPU
market as a whole right now so whereas I
would look at that and be like oh you
know a $400 GTX 970 would be great yeah
like those exists yeah you got a solid
configuration there yeah hey didn't
thank you
next up is wifey sauce oh hi baby so I'm
sorry I forgot to text you and that's
what this is about
$5.00 honey are you coming home for
dinner or having dinner with no I said
he was gonna have dinner here yes I I
asked Paul Guzman for dinner he was like
hey let's hang out or he asked me and I
was like yeah I want to do it so I'm
gonna have dinner with Paul very sorry
honey so you can you should have dinner
with my grandparents although they
probably ready had dinner but you should
hang out with them and keep them company
and I love you and I'll be home soon
okay go to a meeting with Paul I think
the five bucks appreciate your support
is invaluable and ruch wire for the five
Canadians hey guys was wondering what
type of camera to get for both streaming
and content creation was thinking of
getting into it we use a g8 well Paul
uses h5 now for his primary a cam I use
gh4 which is the predecessor and still
works just fine we use mine for get by
with like a g7 what you want is a camera
that's like a mirrorless or that kind of
thing that you can put a decent lens on
that has a clean HDMI out and Panasonic
has several good options for that there
are cheaper solutions so you bear that
in mind what we're using our cameras
that cost a thousand to fifteen hundred
dollars for the body more than that if
you're talking the g h5 and there are
less expensive solutions for that that i
don't know off the top of my head how
much is the g h5 body more than 1,500 i
it was like a year ago that i bought it
and i'd need to look again pretty sad
she's good enough s7 it's the most brain
there's also GG 5s now as well on bnh
right now okay 1800 is what the GH 5
cost but you can do 4 k 6 5 right but
you can do 4k 60 that's nice it's also
got a it also doesn't do the the 4k crop
on the sensor which is nice too yeah
yeah it's annoying because you frame it
up you frame it up on the gh4
yeah and then yeah it crops right a
sensor so you don't get quite as
the visual fidelity race it quits it
okay what's next moving on we've got one
from automatic Matt for the ten dollars
thank you for your automatic donation
hey guys long time no see I've been busy
studying CCNA don't know what that is
so I've had no time to watch the show
but I'll be back to binge watch your
channels in five weeks hopefully good
luck on the CCNA s again not sure what
that is but it sounds like a really hard
Cisco Certified Network Associate there
that's what I was going to say next I'm
sure you're gonna ace it Matt you're a
smart guy cuz you donate to our show and
I have the utmost confidence that you're
gonna kill it and you probably be way
better at networking than we are after
you're done okay definitely probably
even right now so thanks man good luck
hope you do well you guys make me super
sad because you didn't hashtag Pitt my
PC sorry about that
however I'm gonna have to rebuild my
entire system because my cable
management hashtag feels bad man well
good then once you've redone your cable
management submit it again and maybe
we'll pick you and then we could take a
look at it and then we'll make you feel
even more like shit that sounds
reasonable sounds good thank you we doe
Canton fat bag $5 what is the best GPU
for programs like SolidWorks I would say
a Quadro or a fire pro for some like
SolidWorks typically the look at the
suggested required workstation graphics
Kurtz will be a good option yeah like 3d
3d modeling specifically with SolidWorks
I would go with the Quadro I don't know
the Quadro model family like I should so
but depending on the software sometimes
you can get by with a gaming grade
graphics card which can be less
expensive I can't speak to SolidWorks
specifically but I would definitely try
to research and see if there is GPU
acceleration available where SolidWorks
take this advantage of Goethe for
example or OpenCL in which case you
might be able to get by with something
that's a little bit cheaper yeah good
luck on that
and then finally David Olivera is $5 I
don't have much money for a whole new
rising rig I'd love to though thanks for
the answer you are very welcome and
however close you were to building that
rising rig

less closer but we do appreciate it
