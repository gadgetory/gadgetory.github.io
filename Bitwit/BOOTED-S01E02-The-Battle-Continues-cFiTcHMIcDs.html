episode 2 in season 1 so glad to have
you all back if you're just joining us
welcome to the show this is a new user
submitted PC contest where each month 15
users submit their PC to the show and a
live audience which is all of you guys
if you're watching this live right now
on awesomesauce Network I get to vote on
which one of those pcs per month gets
the grand prize of $500 in a gift card
of their choice either Steam or Amazon
to upgrade their system welcome back if
you guys join me for the season premiere
last week thank you so much for coming
back and for supporting the show early
on how does everything sound is the
audio good is the video okay let me know
if there's any like glaring issues
there's not much I can do other than
maybe tweak a few things here and there
so hopefully everything's coming through
clear on your end but whew man I am so
much so much less nervous this episode
than I was the first one because it was
the first one obviously um so hopefully
I'll be talking a little bit more slowly
this time around so you guys can
actually understand what the hell I'm
saying um but we have a great show for
you guys today I keep saying we it's
just me it's just me I'm all alone hey
hopefully help me but why is the lag
real I'm lagging why am i lagging hold
on
how about how bad is the lag guys super
choppy super choppy eh okay let me see
if I can fix this really quick hmm
I cannot edit the settings while
streaming is that so hmm okay okay let
me go ahead and tap into the live
control room here where we have uh-huh
yes yes what are our ingestion settings
vitals by those captain
it doesn't look good doctor I don't know
why captain the doctor would be working
together under any circumstances but
let's go ahead and see if we can change
the stream settings here maybe the bit
rates a bit too high I've underestimated
overestimated the bitstream
settings ingestion what about what if
what if you chop it down to I don't know
is it viewable at 780 or 720 I mean let
me know let me know let me know
15fps really mmm okay okay let me go
ahead and take a look at this right here
trying to see if there's things I can
change without having to stop the stream
now the word we're in it but let me go
ahead and let's do the enable 60fps
maybe I won't enable 60fps Save Changes
I cannot change the setting without okay
I'm gonna do something really quick guys
I'm gonna I'm gonna cut I'm gonna cut
really quick and then we're gonna come
back so don't go anywhere
give me a second I'm gonna change tweak
the the bitrate and then I'll be right
back argh okay let's see
broadcast let me take a look at my yeah
or not we're not overheating on CPU wise
let me go ahead and redo it here
broadcast but restarting now message not
sent error try again huh I can't even
freaking huh buffering it's loading now
guys guys I'm sorry I'm sorry guys so
alright I don't know what I'm doing I
don't know how does drain
wait it's working really much better
much better
yay it's live it's fine I guess
yes it's good is it choppy do I do the
choppy the choppy dance test lalala I
mean most of the time you gonna be
looking at pictures anyway of people's
pcs but when you want to look at my
beautiful face it shouldn't be choppy as
hell shouldn't be sharp at chop yes yes
yes no I'm not drunk again yes yes all
right your anus is ready okay I take
that as a green light to go ahead and
continue on with the show
sorry about that technical difficulty
guys I know what the problem was though
for some somehow the encoder was
actually switched to quick sync instead
of X h.264 so I switched it back and I
think that might have solved the issue
so happy about that sound is good yep
still a little bit choppy it's not gonna
be perfect but okay let's go ahead and
continue on with the show I'm sorry if
it's a little choppy but the show must
go on
I'll investigate it for for episode 3
when we come back next week but let's go
ahead and say hey welcome back to booted
this is episode 2 sorry for the rocky
start
but this is a user PC submitted contest
user submitted PC contest we're 15 guys
go head to head or girls could be either
and someone wins someone wins a how
much do they win $500 at the end of the
month to do whatever they want they can
buy a bunch of Steam games or upgrade
their their current system or build a
whole new one or buy a bunch of cat food
it doesn't really matter but stakes are
high in this little game here that we're
playing so why don't we go ahead and
talk really quickly about how it works I
already have a video on how the on the
whole series works and I even discussed
it in last week's episode but you know
last week I realized that I didn't
actually set the stream to public it was
unlisted so only the people on Twitter
got the link that I sent out so it was
kind of a bummer but for those people
who missed it and didn't even get to
catch the rebroadcast let me just
quickly explain to you how this show
works I'm just gonna blast through it
I'm blasting through it guys so week 1
that was last week week 1 5 computers
were featured and you guys voted 4 of
them out four of them got booted and one
was claimed as a finalist this is week
two this is where we are right now this
is what you're watching this is week two
of season 1 5 new computers 4 of them
will get booted again by your votes and
then week 3 we do the same thing and we
have we end up with the three finalists
who compete go head to head in week 4
the final round
leaving us one winner for the $500 cash
prize shouldn't say it's cash it's kind
of like cash but that but yeah yes
that's pretty much how it works if you
guys didn't happen to catch last week or
you just need a refresher it was pretty
awesome actually the first episode went
super smoothly somehow smoother than
this episode's been going so far but
actually Luke from from the UK I believe
he was worries from was our first
finalist in season one who got who
actually won by a landslide I was I was
pretty surprised because there were some
strong contenders there but you guys
voted him as the worthy PC of being in
the final round
later this month so I'm excellent
excellent job Luke looking forward to
seeing your your rig again in week four
and you've got some pretty healthy
competition lined up though I have seen
the other candidates of course and
they're gonna give you a run for your
money there but on that note why don't
we go ahead and quickly talk about our
sponsor for today because this show
really wouldn't be possible without them
fantex you guys are awesome you guys
have been supporting me from the start
and and you guys are just um you make
really great products that that should
really be well known at this point if
you guys are new novice PC builders
fantex is a great chassis manufacturer
they also make CPU coolers and things
like that but actually recently they've
just launched today in fact their
Eclipse p400 case so if you guys are
interested in doing like kind of like a
low powered or a mid-range system and
you still want to give some some water
cooling a try whether it's custom water
cooling or or just stick an a io in
there for your CPU or GPU this is
actually a really nice budget case that
comes in at a very attractive price of
just 70 bucks I believe for the the non
S version there is an S version that's
silent Edition it's got like sound
dampening material on on like the side
panels and the top vent covers things
like that it's also got some really nice
lighting effects kind of here on the
bottom of the case that you can see they
are interchangeable or it is kind of RGB
it's not super flexible with like sixty
million colors but I think there's like
seven to nine there's a number of
different colors you can cycle through
just like the the enthu looks that i did
the the very famous and popular white
built in which is really cool we're
gonna talk a little bit more about this
case in a little bit later on in the
show but I just wanted to introduce this
case to you guys because it's a it's
actually really nice and we're gonna
take a look at a little video on it
later on but that is pretty much all for
the sponsor spot for now why don't we go
ahead and take a look at our first
victim our first contest
it for for this this week's episode who
was Brandon and Brandon sends in his rig
I should probably get you know the
location so you like Brandon from
Wisconsin but that's not really
important here Brandon this PC number
one here he's got an NZXT s340 very
popular case we're gonna see another one
on today's episode later on got an Intel
Core i7 4790k of fantex you typed eight
points for having a CPU cooler that
belongs to today's sponsor Emma size Z's
z97 SLI crate very popular motherboard
as well HyperX fury 1600 kit speed kit
at eight gigs you've got a GTX 760 in
their super clock from EVGA which i
think is a little bit low powered for
the cpu in there but hey maybe you do a
lot more CPU intensive applications on
your system than GPU intensive so you
know I don't know I'm not gonna judge
there I definitely don't see you know
any any CPU bottlenecking there of
course I've got a bx 200 i believe
that's a crucial SSD at 480 gigs very
nice barracuda 1 terabyte good luck on
that one in an e BG a 500 watt power
supply and i don't know why we're taking
a look at the the swag the the mountain
dew and doritos first that was one of
his optional his optional hump pictures
that he sent in this was the other one
because i give everyone who submits a PC
to booted two optional pictures that can
take pictures of whatever they want of
their case and Brandon here decided to
go with Mountain Dew and Doritos I think
he's kind of like appealing to the
audience you know like like yeah I'm a
hardcore gamer I've got I drink Mountain
Dew and eat stuff that's bad for me but
absolutely delicious how about them
Doritos commercials on on the Superbowl
by the way those are some of the best
ones of the year so uh let's let's take
a look at your actual system I'm gonna
look at the side profile here obviously
the the H for the S 340 is a great case
but let's see what you managed to do
here excellent job on the
black-and-white color coordination I
think that's absolutely fantastic also I
can go ahead and queue up some some nice
PC review music in the background if you
guys are interested which is gonna go
ahead and play right now is it is it
though there we go let me know if the
music's too loud guys but I thought
maybe we'll spice it up with a little
bit of tunes in the background for happy
for happy viewing all around excellent
color theme here man
and cable management looks pretty good
for the most part until they get a
closer look at your money shot no wait
not the money shot it was the site the
side shot because your CPU cooler fans
they have these really nice black sleeve
cables but that doesn't mean you can
still string them anywhere and it looks
like you've clearly just kind of run one
of them across across your video card
and into the motherboard header header
this is actually one of the the most
annoying things that I talked about in
my top annoying things about billing PC
is where to find a place for those fan
cables when you're routing them to those
motherboard headers especially when you
have a case with a sight panel window
and it just looks a little bit sloppy I
might say where everything else is is
wired so cleanly but that CPU cooler fan
cable is is kind of ruining it for me
maybe you could get a zip tie to tighten
up those PCIe cables as well but
altogether this is a really solid build
let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the money shot money shot baby do that
upskirt beautiful CPU cooler again
everything's matching very nicely as
well as the video card you even got some
some black and white it looks like you
might have no it doesn't look like you
spray-painted I think it just comes that
way but it's very nice job all around we
can take a look one more look at the
mountain Dew and Doritos which I think
are fantastic not color-coordinated at
all too loud okay
I'm gonna I'm gonna turn the music down
or off let's go ahead and turn the music
off apparently that was not a good idea
I'm sorry guys I'm sorry the music
turned down the music okay you know what
I was trying to you know someone someone
like in the last video was like music I
really want music but I guess he was the
only one or or it's just too damn loud
and I forgot to change the volume on it
appropriately so on that note Brandon
nice job there are certain things here
though that I would have changed instead
but we'll leave it up to the audience to
decide how exactly you you do and that
was that was a long time spent on that
first guy so I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of
go a little bit quicker on these next
few we've gotten so far you're very
close to to being Jafar from Aladdin but
I'm sure you get that all the time so
I'm sorry that's very immature and it's
sensitive of me but you've got a fractal
design defined s amazing case no bias
here whatsoever
AMD FX 8350 a 99 FX Pro R 2.0 board 16
gigs of Ripjaws g.skill memory at 1600
speed gigabyte g1 gaming geforce gtx 960
and a you've got 3 WD blues in here 300
gigabytes i believe he told me that
we're you mentioned that they were taken
from laptops which is perfectly fine and
of course err CX 600 so let's go ahead
where'd I go let's go ahead and take a
look at the side here and ok just
starting out it it looks like you kind
of made an effort to color-coordinate
the dim heat spreaders to the heat sinks
on your motherboard but kind of fell off
the boat with the the cable management
not the cable management the power
supply really ketchup and mustard cables
are never really that nice to look at
they don't really match with anything
unless like you go out of your way to
make like red and yellow your main
primary colors for your system and also
the sticker on your power supply is is
definitely killing it for me so I
probably would have to dock you some
points for the pack just the power
supply alone including with those cables
also this the stock cooler I think that
you know you you probably could have
found something in like the $30.00 range
that just looks a lot nicer and it's
also much much quieter when you're under
load clearly you're doing some gaming on
here with the gtx 960 and i don't want
to I wouldn't want to be in your room
anytime that stock cooler you know picks
up speed
maybe maybe test out a wraith cooler one
of those new AMD wraith coolers that are
coming out soon but yeah you know
honestly let's go ahead and take a look
at this at this portion here very clean
though cable management is on point
despite the the ketchup and mustard
eveness and you even tried to manage
hiding hiding that cpu cooler cable
which which is not just like hanging out
kind of like like Brandon system was so
I think that's that's really good that's
gonna gain you some points there
altogether a pretty solid rig but I
don't know I think I think there are
certain certain that shortcomings here
where you could have really improved
upon the the power supply I mean you can
get a nice power supply or just get some
cable sleeping and ripped that that
sticker off
and you'd be good to go but all together
a really nice build
Zafar vet and ass I love it I love it a
lot
and then the next up we've got Marcus
within NZXT this is the other s340 that
I was talking about earlier with a n FX
6300 you've got a coolermaster vortex
plus cooler the gigabyte 970 a ds3 p
motherboard 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix
sport ddr3 and an msi r9 380 F video
card 120 gig SSD you've got a one
terabyte Seagate drive in there as well
as a 500 gig EVGA power supply alright
alright let's see what you got here see
what you're working with here Marcus
let's see what you got here ok the first
thing that catches my eye is that awful
yellow sticker that's on your CPU cooler
I mean it's got a horrible looking cable
anyway that maybe could have been routed
a little bit better out of sites you
would have had to go the extra mile
there but the least you could have done
was take off that yellow sticker cuz it
the only thing it really matches is the
Justice hideous 24 pin cable with that
with that mustard enos and yeah it's
almost a shame to see that you have a
power supply shroud which is covering
the ugly sticker that is probably on
your EVGA power supply but you've still
got that 24 pin so maybe you should have
gotten some some black sleeve cables for
the submission Marcus if you were really
thinking thinking ahead there but there
are certain things to like about this
build cable management though I mean is
is kind of I'm on the fence about it
because the top half looks really good
but the lower you go especially with the
PCIe and the static to say the data
connectors that are kind of just like
octopus in at the bottom there there's
no real rhyme or reason for them they
just look a little bit messy I think
that could have been taken a little bit
you know it could have been handled a
bit better and it kind of looks like
your PCIe cable right where the
connector is it looks a little bit
tangled I don't know maybe you should
have zip-tied it a little bit tighter I
don't know if that's really the the nod
it looks like it's kind of in a knot to
me and that doesn't look the best in my
opinion but it does look like the rest
of your system is fairly clean not a
huge fan of that Brown PCB on the
motherboard either if we're going if
we're just talking
strictly about aesthetics the brown PCB
not doing anything for me I think the
audience will have to decide for
themselves whether that's worth docking
any points for your build overall but
why don't we go ahead and take a look at
your money shot to get a closer look the
other thing is those green PCBs on the
dims I know Crucial Ballistix you know
that they've got the reviews on them are
kind of polarizing but I think the thing
that stands out to me most when it comes
to Cosmetics is that not-so-hot
green PCB that kind of kills the kills
the vibe of what you've got going on
here and granted it doesn't look like
you tried to make your system black and
blue because none of the other parts
except for the case are really have any
blue accents on them but at the very
least you can make the the other
components more neutral more color
neutral to not clash with that that that
blue on your s340 so much so um yeah man
I don't know what to say it looks like
again that that bottom area where your
cables are just kind of going through
that one cutout it looks like they're
all rushing to get there let's see what
you got over here LED blue LEDs so it
does look like you're kind of going with
the blue theme and I guess with the LEDs
on you can't tell the color difference
as much with all the different cables
and stuff and components but it looks
pretty good it looks like there's a fair
amount of even lighting around here in
your case which which I rather liked so
you've got you've nailed that one on the
head and just looking on the outside it
looks like you take pretty good care of
your system as well there's not too much
dust buildup maybe you know you could
have just cleaned it right before you
took pictures and submitted your PC to
the show but but but I'm none the wiser
so nice nice job Marcus let's go ahead
and move on to Mitchell Mitchell's got
an H 440 NZXT cases all around all the
NZXT cases we've got a core i5 6600 K an
NZXT kraken x41 ACS z170a our
motherboard so that's nice that you've
paired an unlocks Q of CPU with an
overclocking board I like that 16 gigs
of Corsair Vengeance 2400 and a GTX 960
super super clocked Cod from EVGA S 850
Evo SSD from Sam Samsung 500 gig and a
CX 750 m and beautiful thing about this
case is you don't have to worry about
that
that's stupid power supply sticker
because you've got a power supply shroud
and Wow actually this looks pretty good
not not too shabby man at first I see
the LED strip right off the bat the
first thing I see but granted it's not
going to bother me that much in the long
run because you're not gonna see it with
that side panel window on with that side
panel on and I realized why you did it
because last week we had a guy who had
the same case and took an LED strip but
he actually had it stripped lining the
wall lining that hard drive cage wall
and it was just too close to the actual
side panel window where you could just
see the the glare of the LEDs peeking
out from the outside and I actually
knocked him some points for that so not
kudos to you for really realizing that
and putting the LEDs further away from
the side panel window I think that was a
smart move altogether I do wish that the
top fan matched the fan on your 120
radiator there I'm a big stickler with
like matching fans inside of a case
especially when they're close together
if you had gotten like a fan with like
some white blades at the top ooh that
would be that would be sexy so maybe
some miss points on that so let's go
ahead and take a look at the rule okay
this ain't bad this ain't bad I think I
think you've been taking notes sir I
think you noticed the color scheme of my
desktop setup back there and end of
hotline and I think you purposely
programmed the hue plus to to those
particular colors but you have to
remember sir while I do like this very
much and I think this looks sexy is how
I'm not the one that's gonna be voting
on your system so hopefully the the
audience that's watching us right now
has a similar taste as as yours truly
but very nice execution there you can
definitely see that the LEDs do not
they're not super bright or close to the
the right side edge of that window which
is really nice money shot take a look
here okay cable management pretty on
point I can't tell I can't tell if
that's a brown motherboard it kind of
looks like it is and I'm gonna give you
that I'm gonna dock you the same number
of points as I did the last guy for
having a brown PCB if that is in fact
Brown I can't really tell from the
picture but
Brown PCBs remind me of poop and in fact
they are the poop of all motherboards
everywhere so shame on you doc can you
points I'm taking all the points away
even though the points in this show
don't matter just like whose line is
anyway
but thank you Mitchell for that system
that was number four everyone and our
last contender for tonight is Robin
Robin brave Sir Robin he bravely ran
away shark shark Coon shark Coon there's
a case named shark Coon t3w Intel Core
i5 4590 stock cooler which I'm okay with
in the fact that you don't have a
unlocks Q but not okay in the fact that
they don't look the prettiest or sound
the prettiest MSI z97 gaming three
motherboard HyperX fury eight gigs of
ram at 1600 and r9 380 GPU from msi one
terabyte WD blue and the chrome esta be
500 feet to pass a plan yeah okay let's
go ahead and take a look at the side
profile ah okay um you know for for just
a really budget case that probably
doesn't have many cable routing options
it looks pretty clean I mean it looks a
little bit loose I feel like things
could have been tightened up around the
PCIe as well as the power supply itself
all of those routing into that one big
grommet there could have been routed and
squeezed together and just as if just
zip tied down not to mention the ketchup
and mustard problem with although that
is a non modular power supply as well so
you're gonna get you know you got to
deal with that that's that's something
to consider you're not gonna have the
cleanliness that you might have
otherwise with a with a modular unit
that stock cooler is just staring at me
and it hates me it hates me right now
this could honestly be a pretty nice
matching match you rig being red and
black as your main colors but the case
accents it is that looks like a red
painted interior on the motherboard tray
so you don't see many cases that have
like a red painted motherboard tray but
that could work out really nice to your
benefit with that gaining three
motherboard that you have as well as
that MSI
r9 380 there that cooler everything's
very matchy-matchy but there's just
certain elements here that are missing
to really create a cohesive color scheme
that I feel you might get dots and
points for so let's go ahead and take a
look at the other side or an outside
look here's just another shot of the
case not a huge fan of the aesthetic of
the case that's just a personal
preference of mine you know it's it's it
could just be because it's just not not
my taste or it's it's really budget but
the other thing to consider here that I
didn't even realize until now is that
you've got an unlocked you've got a lot
you've got a locked processor that you
can't overclock on but you have a z97
board that that is that that's used for
overclocking you pay an extra premium
for that kind of feature it's like one
of the main features of that board so
I'm gonna have to duck you some more
points here Robin I'm sorry bro but that
just that just doesn't seem like the
best decision from the get-go unless you
plan on upgrading your CPU to you know
something like the core i7 and like an
unlocks a skylight processor in the
future or you could even get get get a
locked
skylake processor and hope that Intel
doesn't nerf the BIOS overclocking
feature on on those types of CPUs but in
the current state that it is I'm not
sure that that was the best decision the
best pair up component wise for CPU and
motherboards so on that note Robin
brave Sir Robin that is pretty much
those are pretty much all the entries
guys I know this was I kind of I don't
know if this seemed a lot quicker I
actually made a point to condense the
amount of time that I talked about each
of these systems because I want this to
be easily digestible it should be about
the length of an actual show 24 to 30
minutes and the first episode was like
40 minutes long which I was anticipating
15 so hopefully you guys are cool with
that little bit of a length change there
but why don't we go ahead and quickly
recap the the five the five contenders
here I'm just gonna go through them
really quickly we've got butter on done
this is PC number one remember remember
these pcs by their number not their name
because that's how we're gonna be voting
for them guys so this is PC number one
with his s340 very nice there and
we've got PC number two was this guy I
can see you guys already voting in chat
but hold on the link is about to go out
but not quite yet we've gotten PC number
three I'll give you guys the side
profile here just give me a sec this is
PC number three all right got PC number
four give you another side profile
all right that's PC number four and then
lastly we've got the one we just looked
at piece number five okay those are your
five options those are the five folks
that we have to vote on and right about
now you should be seeing a link pop up
in chat my beautiful life is uh posting
a link in chat she'll post it a couple
times so you guys don't miss it but at
that point click the link and vote on
whichever PC you feel deserves to go on
the final round and really think about
it guys cuz I'm gonna give you some some
time to think about that and I'll leave
the thumbnails up here so obviously if
you think this PC was the best vote on
number two if you think this PC was the
best phone number one and so forth but
in the meantime while you guys give it
some some long hard thought I said long
and hard let's go ahead and take a look
at our sponsor one more time fantex
thank you so much again for sponsoring
the show I hope you don't regret it now
that we're two episodes deep but again
taking a look at their clips p400
they've even got a freaking youtube
video on it
that's pretty snazzy I think the audio
is in there so let me know if it's it's
too loud just like my music from earlier
but yeah take a look at that sexy beast
is this is this too high of you know
what you don't you guys don't get 1080
he gets 720 because 720 is more
manageable and even that might be too
much is it lagging lag a lagging oh it's
totally lagging ermahgerd maybe video is
not the best idea here let's do let's do
480 House 480 do still lagging good my
bear still oh yeah at any rate you can
kind of see all the different features
here there's tons of cooling up to 6
fans in the case
it is ATX so full size motherboards it
even supports eh TX I believe up to 360
millimeters of radiator clearance at the
front or a 360 rad support I should say
and then you know bust out the dubstep
as soon as you show all the air flood
got SSD mounts at the back with the kind
of nice little mini drive cage at the
bottom right right in front of the power
supply look at all that room for routing
cables guys this is a $70 case and you
get a ton of great cable management
options outstanding storage
configuration and that 360 custom water
cooling radiator support at the front
they're very popular modular drive trays
right there all the dust filters you
would need and again those LEDs at the
bottom of the case that are configurable
in several different colors to match
your your overall desk theme this is
also compatible the RGB is compatible
with the RGB strips that fantex offers
so as you change the colors with the
button on your case the LED strip that
you buy separately will also change
inside of your chassis so excellent
stuff I actually had a chance to check
these out check these cases out while I
was at CES this year and they were
pretty sweet honestly I overestimated
underestimated how much they were I
think I guess it's like uh you're
probably selling this for like 90 to 100
bucks and the guys they were like nope
it's it's 100 or it's not nope it's like
70 bucks so really good offer a really
good deal and an outstanding value all
around from fan text if you guys want to
check more of their stuff out I put a
link in the description below but I
think on that note guys and sorry that
this has been a little bit laggy but it
is time man this is intense it's time to
look at our results for the voting I
believe I've given you enough time I'm
putting the music in I'm putting some
dramatic music because it just needs to
amp I just need to amp this up can't
stress to you the gravity of this
situation right now hopefully it's not
blowing your ears out but at the other
day five of you came here today and
submitted your pc's gave it everything
you got for a grand prize of $500
unfortunately only one of you can beat a
grand
prize finalists or just a finalist in
general the other four will be booted
and sent home with nothing so on that
note ladies and gentlemen who is the
week two finalists PC number four by a
landslide Wow
49% the other four of you with the lower
score scoring votes you gave it your all
you put in a valiant effort but I'm
sorry you've been booted so PC number
four who is that Mitchell and I actually
kind of would have gone with the same
route honestly your your cable routing
was on point sir I like what you did
with the LED strip I already mentioned
that and just a really clean
black-and-white aesthetic with nothing
standing out in terms of you know ugly
power supply cables or you know Brown
PCBs well I don't know about that brass
piece of you I'm not sure about that but
I think this was a great belt and
obviously the live audience today feels
the same way because we will be seeing
you in week four of this season so
congratulations sir we're all very proud
of you you'll be going up against Luke
and let's just take a look really quick
one more time at Luke's build which is
right yeah kind of similar Hey look at
that they're both they're both NZXT
cases and stuff yep so we'll see we'll
see how this goes
but guys before you go before you head
out and we close this out guess what a
lot of you guys have been asking me this
on Twitter and and I'm said Facebook who
uses Facebook Twitter and Instagram and
and all the other socials and YouTube
especially you can now submit your PC to
booted submissions have now reopened for
season two they've been closed for like
the last two weeks they've been closed
for a long time and you guys are like my
know the submission is gonna be open
whatever the submissions gonna be open
they're open now but it's it's gonna be
a budget PC Edition guys so budget pcs
only under $700 I know this is hard to
quantify does he mean $700 like at the
time when I bought the parts or $700 you
know currently like what they're worth
now just just it's opened it up to
interpretation if you think that you
might be eligible for a budget PC entry
submit it there's a link in the
description on how to enter with all of
the relevant information guys make sure
you turn on Anna
patience for for that as well because
there's a vital information there the
submissions are gonna be open till
Friday February 12th so get crackin
that's this Friday submissions will
close for a season two and they won't
open for another month or so so if
you're if you got a bunch of piscine you
want to show it off go for it and now
we're going bungee pc's because I know a
lot of you guys don't have the money to
fork out on high-end systems and those
are the people who really could use the
$500 to amp up the rigs and get that you
know smooth 60fps gameplay at 1080 or
higher so that's why we're going with
budget guys hopefully that's
understandable for all of you if you
guys want to watch the show live if you
want to catch it live that is not why do
I click on that that's not it no I don't
know what I'm doing catch it live on
