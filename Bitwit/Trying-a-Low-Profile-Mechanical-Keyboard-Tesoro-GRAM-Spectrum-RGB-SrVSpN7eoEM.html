guys welcome back to the channel today
we are doing another review on this
beautiful keyboard right behind me this
is the Tesoro gram spectrum RGB but
meaning to do this review for a while
just now getting around to it and you'll
excuse the loose unscripted format for
today's video I've actually kind of been
in a rush this week because I leave for
Hong Kong in just a couple days so I'm
trying to pump out a lot of content
before I hop up my flight so I actually
have stuff to post while I'm abroad so
yeah but this is a pretty cool keyboard
we're talking about today it is a
mechanical keyboard it features two
sorro's agile switches which are not
cherry MX I know that's a deal-breaker
for some of you but it does have a few
tricks up its mechanical sleeve to make
it more enticing so why don't we go
ahead and dive right in to see what
makes this keyboard so special let's
check it out check it out now alright so
here's the keyboard it's got some
backlit LEDs 16.8 million colors Oh Matt
so many to choose from although my eyes
can really only ever see about eight of
them so there's that but you do get your
options there well we'll dig into the
software in just a bit however you can
see that we've got this white very clean
kind of pristine looking light on the
LEDs on going you see we've got this
really nice white aesthetic here there
aren't too many keyboards that do this
they're just completely white I feel a
bit conflicted about this one part of me
is like yeah all white its unique it's
cool the other half of me is like this
is gonna look awful in like a few weeks
after my grimy hands have been you know
typing away on keys you know I'm opening
boxes everyday that you know are in the
mail they're all dusty and dirty and
stuff and then I go ahead and type on
the keys that might really mess this up
very quickly so bear that in mind if you
are going to go with this white version
they do offer a black version as well
and I think that's probably going to be
a lot more forgiving when it comes to
wear and tear and dirt buildup and that
sort of thing also you do get some
variety of switches these are the agile
Reds and I can take this off even though
you can't really see from there maybe
I'll cut to some b-roll or something
these feature agile red switches these
keyboards will also come in
blue black or brown switches so you have
your pick there now let me break it down
for you what's different about these
agile switches and how they compare to
their cherry MX red counterparts so
first off the actuation distance and the
travel distance on the agile switches is
actually a bit shorter than it is on
Cherry MX red so for actuation distance
we get 1.5 millimeters which means you
only need to press the key 1.5
millimeters down until it actuates the
keystroke and sends the signal where as
Cherry MX Reds I believe is 2
millimetres right so that's that's a bit
longer that you have to go down in order
for it to depress or to actuate I should
say for bottoming out your travel
distance total on the agile switches is
3.5 millimeters so that's basically from
the very top to the very bottom
bottoming out the key whereas on the
Cherry MX Reds it's four millimeters so
you do have to go a little bit further
down now it's a personal preference
thing some people like that extra
actuation distance or that travel
distance I should say because it's just
it's more tactile and I would tend to
agree with that I feel like these keys
are not quite as tactile because of that
reason as something like the cherry MX
Reds however they do seem to be a bit
quicker when you press them down because
you're not actually having to bottom out
the keys quite as far so that's kind of
a nice feature there
Tesoro is advertising the gram spectrum
to be the fastest mechanical keyboard
with the fastest switches I don't know
if that's necessarily true I mean if you
take a look at the Cherry MX speed
switches which are exclusively on the
Corsair k70 rapid-fire right now those
have an actuation distance of one point
two millimeters so that's actually 0.3
millimeters faster than the agile Reds
here at least given that particular
specification so as far as like typing
though if you're if you're talking like
subjective review stuff here like what
do I actually think of the typing I
think it's it's actually pretty nice
like the typing experience the gaming
experience I played half an hour of doom
with this thing and once you get used to
the shorter travel distance I think
that's the biggest kind of thing that
you have to get used to it actually
works really well and it's comfortable
my typing experience has been fairly
positive on it so far not really too
many complaints there again it's just
going to rely heavily on preference and
how much you're in doctrine into the
Cherry MX universe where you know is it
going to be too much of a change going
to something like these agile switches
the X
have low profile key caps as well so
these key caps are half as tall as like
most standard issue key caps so I guess
that also kind of provides a different
feel again something you might have to
get used to I'm not a I'm not a huge I'm
not a huge fan of them nor am I like
hating on them either I just I think
that you know they don't do much for me
but they're there some people might
prefer them just for the aesthetic thing
it kind of gives your keyboard a lot
slimmer of an appearance which kind of
might jive well for your style and
tastes so there's that rattling off some
other fun specs here you get sixty
million keystrokes per key as well as a
1,000 Hertz polling rate and 100%
anti-ghosting with full six or any key
roll overs so you can pretty much smash
your face against this thing and every
single key that your face hits will be
actuated because we've all been in that
situation where you're smashing your
face against your keyboard it happens it
happens all the time you've also got a
very nice detachable cable here it's six
foot braided USB and look at this it's a
mini USB connector which I really really
appreciate over the micro USB just
because there's a bit more rigidity to
it so that's a big plus for me as far as
the keyboard itself the construction is
super well built I mean build quality is
top-notch here the key caps are double
injection they look really nice at least
on the day of unboxing wait until I eat
some Cheetos first and then go on a
typing rampage the body itself is
actually really solid as well I mean
there's like zero flex it's completely
sturdy it's got a plastic housing but an
internal metal base across the entire
thing so it gives this really nice heft
to it so it doesn't slide around
additionally to help with that I'd leave
on the underbelly we do have some some
some stuff here we've got some rubber
padding which again for anti slip stuff
as I've sang saying stuff a lot saying
stuff way too much and you've got these
little flip-out feet to flip out feets
which give it actually at a decent angle
a nice incline for a more ergonomic
typing and those feet actually have
rubberized pads on them as well so just
to aid in the non slippage in the top
right corner here you get a Tesoro logo
which thankfully isn't too intrusive
right beside three LED indicators in
blue now I wish these were either white
something more color neutral to match
with your theme the theme of your desk
or if you could just configure them all
together two different colors in the
software
match and tie in with your with your
color scheme and stuff unfortunately
you're stuck with blue what can you do
these are representing your caps lock
and unlock and gaming mode so this
keyboard can actually switch between PC
mode and gaming mode gaming mode
essentially enables any kind of preset
macros that you've configured in the
software by the way you can also record
macros on-the-fly from your hardware
itself just start a recording session
with the home button and then you're on
your way to recording a macro simply by
tapping some keys which is kind of cool
the other thing that gaming mode does is
it disables your Windows key so you know
you don't back out of the game
unexpectedly take a look at our F Keys
up here first off you've got five
profile Keys f1 through f5 you have five
different profiles that you can switch
between again your windows lock keys f6
f7 through f12 are your multimedia keys
now one small gripe I have here is that
you get you know your volume up and down
keys which is fine better than nothing
but I've gotten so used to having a
volume knob on the k70 RGB that it's
just it's super convenient and I think
at this sort of price point for a
mechanical keyboard especially if you've
got a number pad in there and it's not a
super compact keyboard then it should
have some kind of volume knob or volume
wheel because it's just super convenient
especially when you're in the heat of
battle and you need to turn something up
or down someone comes in the room
whatever I've gotten really really used
to it again this is huge personal
preference but that is how I feel about
it so on that note before we hop into
the software and I show you what that
all entails I kind of want to show you
guys what is possible on the keyboard
itself without ever loading up the
software because there are a couple
things you can do here for example if
you hold function and you tap on the up
and down arrows you can change the
brightness there's four different levels
of brightness on the backlighting as
well as off so you can of course and
disable it all together if you wish but
via brightest level is super bright and
honestly the RGB implementation like the
LEDs on this keyboard are some of the
best I've seen I said this about the
last Tesoro keyboard I reviewed almost a
year ago or so that it was just a cut
above everything else this is honestly
nicer backlighting then the K 70
rapid-fire it's it seriously is in a
league of its own and I do commend
Tesoro on that achievement however we're
going to see what else it can do here so
let's go ahead and check
got some of the other modes so I believe
this one this is kind of yours they have
names and stuff fun names trigger so
this is probably just you know Firefly
we'll call this one Firefly you tap it
it lights up for a second and then it
goes away beautiful this is kind of a
ripple effect we're pretty familiar with
this one boom boom boom how do we got
here and I'm basically just holding down
function and doing left and right on the
arrow keys this time this is called
firework or fireworks if I remember
correctly and it kind of does like this
a OE thing where it lights up the
surrounding adjacent keys
just kind of cool you also got this is
like Glaser you 2qq breathing of course
it wouldn't be an RGB keyboard with
fancy LED effects if it didn't have a
breathing mode and then of course you
have the very nice pretty one this is
the spectrum mode or a rainbow way
whatever they call it
and it doesn't have any kind of reactive
properties it's just boom it's just boom
and then there's this one which it kind
of looks like a game gaming mode sort of
thing where you've got your WASD and
surrounding keys all lit up pretty much
the right-half the keyboard is
completely out but there you guys have
it that's pretty much what you can do
from the keyboard in terms of
illumination now we can go ahead and
jump into the software and see what kind
of finer tuning we can do with that as
well as things like macros and stuff so
let's quickly dive into that alright gel
so here we are in the software and holy
smokes look at how small this font is
just geez geez gee whiz super tiny I
mean I've got that gonna do to a grass I
got a good vision and I still have a
hard time seeing this little stuff sync
program macro setting I can't imagine
like any old ladies who were rocking the
gram spectrum right now please get out
the telescope late us I can't see a damn
thing in this software so um yeah I
don't know if there's like some sort of
UI scale or the good scale up the font
maybe that big let it go any cool look
in the mid to sorrel but getting back on
topic here let's see let's we're gonna
mess with profile 1 everyone click the
tilde key it will be our little guinea
pig for today and you can see all these
options here you got options so you got
a macro you can write a name for the
macro you can record and do some keys
you can stop you can change oh my god
look at the font it's even tinier here
what the hell what does that even say
set selected items to 50 millisecond gee
I I can't read this at all Tesoro this
is unacceptable I can't like enlarge the
window or anything I can't even move the
window this is just not good not good
guys but yeah ok I'm gonna go ahead and
change this to what I think is 25
milliseconds according to my eyesight
change that you can change all that you
know you can you can select them all you
can select none you can delete them if
you want delete them if you want insert
a single key insert a copy item you can
have the macro repeat as many times as
you like you can have it repeat
continuously while pressed or repeat
continuously until the key is pressed
again press ok and next time I hit the
tilde key in the appropriate environment
it'll do all those keystrokes that I put
in there earlier so that's nice key
assignment it's kind of like a boring
macro I mean basically just Jay this
used to be a tilde key and now it's the
number 5 there you go
that's that's special right exciting
sync program so what this is is so you
know how we've got different profile
modes here you've got five different
user user defined profiles well it can
be kind of annoying if you've got
different profiles for different
applications like you've got one profile
for Battlefield you got one profile for
h1z1 well basically this function allows
you to switch profiles on the fly so as
soon as you launch up a program it will
switch over to the profile that you've
assigned it to that way you don't have
to manually switch it every time even
though it is pretty easy doing it on the
fly with those F keys up at the top of
the keyboard it is much easier just just
to have it all done for you so that's a
pretty cool feature there again you've
got disable default put your key back to
its default setting that it shipped with
and then there's launch programs so if
you wanted to you could assign a key to
open up a program of your choice which
is kind of cool as well really quick
before we move on you do have the option
to export or import profiles there is
512 kilobits of onboard memory and this
is a this is all being like powered by a
32 bits cortex premium processor that's
going to handle all your led stuff all
the macros and things like that so
moving right along to LED effects here I
believe these are the seven or eight
different presets that we looked at
earlier so you can slow
them of course through the software
itself there's also spectrum colors
which again is is lighting up your WASD
Keys for gaming and the in the
surrounding keys so you can have that
breathe you can have it apply a static
color where it just stays static or you
can do trigger which is kind of the more
reactive touch to type effect like so so
that's fun over here you get
illumination
I'll only exit out of here illumination
and it says select a backlit color so
let's do red apply boom and there's red
looks fairly accurate looks a little on
the pinkish side I did notice that when
going to white and applying that it does
look fairly pink I'm not sure how it's
coming across to you guys on camera but
here from here it looks very pinkish I
think that could be maybe because
there's some red housing underneath the
key caps as we saw earlier which I
wasn't a huge fan of especially not if
it's affecting our LED color so what you
could do is potentially I don't know
cool it down a little bit by by applying
just a little wee bit of blueness that
that seems to help a little bit you kind
of have to get the right shade of blue I
did it earlier I did it earlier I
promise
not a little dogs too blue now that's
too blue but and here's another problem
that I have with the keyboard see this
looks good this is nice and white looks
looks much cooler much more true to
being white however um this little color
bar here in the software is all you get
that's your color picker right there and
it's very tiny and it's really hard to
be precise
I mean if you wanted to really go
through all 16.8 million colors it would
be quite a tedious task to say the least
of course you do have some preset colors
here which I don't believe you can swap
out for for colors of your choice let's
say there's like a custom color that you
wanted to save to one of these I don't
think that's an option here so fairly
limited on how you can actually pick and
choose your various color options which
good there's some room for improvement
here but apart from that it works well
again the LEDs themselves physically are
some of the nicest I've seen on any
mechanical keyboard the software on the
other hand could use quite a bit of work
so on that note
before we close out this video why don't
we go ahead and fire up a quick little
sound test comparing the agile Reds
which is on the gram spectrum to the
Cherry MX red switches on my Corsair k70
RGB now the last thing I wanted to
mention about this keyboard is the price
which is a hundred and forty dollars USD
at least at the time of filming this
video on amazon.com so that positions it
kind of you know in the high end I mean
it's not the most expensive mechanical
keyboard that we've seen I mean the k70
RGB rapid-fire is 165 I think on Amazon
right now that's twenty-five dollars
more than what you pay for this granted
you get cherry MX keys which a lot of
you just need you just need that cherry
MX in your life zero zero tolerance for
anything else which I completely
understand but you kind of just have to
value you know figure out what your
priorities are in a mechanical keyboard
what I would do is potentially find a
way to try this out see how you like it
with typing and gaming make sure you
game on it too because the experience
there can be completely different than
writing an email or typing on a Word
document for example so make sure you
try it out to see if you are a fan of
the low profile switches of these agile
Reds you know honestly it's a really
high-quality keyboard Tesoro has done a
nice job of making it feel like a
premium product which it is and the LED
backlighting again I can't really rant
and rave about that enough
however the software again should be
improved
Tesoro I can't can't read anything I
just can't see anything so just make
make those changes and then get back to
me and I'll be I'll be happy
cool and everything else I said just
make everything just do what I say all
the time ah that's pretty much gonna
wrap it up for this video guys again
sorry for the loose and unscripted
format hopefully that was okay and thank
you all for watching this here video be
sure to give me a like on it toss me a
like if you enjoyed it also feel free to
let me know what you think of this
keyboard in the comments below before
you go don't forget to test me know I
already said that whoa deja vu I'm going
crazy check out my store where I'm
selling shirts and hoodies and
merchandise and things like that more
items will be added to the store in the
near future so stay tuned for all that
and subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already thank you all for
watching and I will see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
