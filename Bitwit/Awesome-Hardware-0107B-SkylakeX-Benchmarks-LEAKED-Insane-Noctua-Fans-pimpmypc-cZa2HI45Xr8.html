time say pineapple three times fast and
look at the light any light in the room
the brightest light that you can find
and your sneeze you're premeditated
sneeze will be neutralized instantly
it's amazing I know it works but why
would you ever want to stop a sneeze
unless you're like about to kiss someone
you're right now I feel unfulfilled yeah
you should
sneezes are awesome Hey well they
released dopamine they make you feel
great and now that's been taken from me
yes it has you wanna sit well
temperature yes yes I feel so feel Rob's
order to let them feel so robbed okay
all right life hacks with Kyle yep it's
a new segment coming soon um all right
so what what's happening we should
probably go live to YouTube we are we
are already dead
hey welcome everyone welcome remember a
few minutes a minute ago when I was like
I'm gonna go live to you - nope don't
reveal it at all okay
um hey is there usually more than one
thing we go live - uh no no I just have
a really poor memory right now
jet lag jet lag jelly I pull it up to
get excuse playing the jet lag like
Laurel and Hardy like Laurel and Hardy
this those those old-school gangsters
the routine no Laurel and Hardy did
who's on first right right I said who
did who's on first
what does have to do with them being
gangsters nope all cuz it was the same
time period like well gigs gangsters
again stirs exist now but just in the
streets of our city I know you know
they're called Bloods and Cripps doesn't
mean that they're related to louis c.k
just kiddies a comedian
it said Laurel hard you do who's on
first
cuz if I can at least remember that
there's a oh man yes Laurel and Hardy -
who's up first all right they're not
gangsters no and I'm sure they Jews
teens where they pretended to be
gangsters but probably where I got that
you know it really sucks is that I
googled it and there's actually a lady
called named Laura Hardy Laura on rock
rock Laura Hart Laura Hardy oh she
probably gets that all the time any
relation til it's Laurel and hurry
well I also knew was Laurel and Hardy
despite the dude who was talking about
that did misspell that so I knew that as
well I'm trying to dig myself out of a
hole here yeah
stop trying Abbott and Costello wait
Internet no you're right I was wrong
it's a Vedika still it is nevermind
you're on a string right now my my
knowledge of like early comedians and
everything is alright haven't as soon as
that I'm gonna stop but like no those
comedians those were those download
movies just cuz I'm comedians
yeah I know I'm imitating what you would
say next shut up at the rate you're
going wouldn't go to fancy all right
yeah again the time again we're putting
up pull out all the stops for jet lag ah
um we are so just like gravy right I
need a much bigger shovel seriously dude
I'm not gonna try to I'm not gonna try
to say anything of consequence or
importance now this is the show how is
this show like suddenly deteriorated so
much since your half never in mind we've
been drinking a little bit I feel like
we're way more loopy right now because
of the jet lag and that's not an excuse
just because we were already pretty
exhausted and we're in tight we're on
Taiwan so your wife has just passed out
right there yeah he's you go to the
bathroom you guys know she's just
wifey sauce is dead you like she's
probably dead she's probably not even
breathing right now we wouldn't even
know you're looking at her she's just
it's just the jet lag we're using Ellis
using the jet lag I know she's a biatch
you know just for sucking up all the all
the glory and rub it in our faces I'm
just gonna sleep right here where they
could see me so whenever they go to the
bathroom like ah I wish I could do that
right now I have to host a live show
that's how she thinks that's for how
evil she is yeah somehow does it must be
so hard finished erections okay let's
let's go onto the show here all right um
this is episode 107
outs a sounds crazy to say that then 107
of these we still have no idea what
we're doing but thank you for joining us
nonetheless this is a side B if you have
a watch side a which is the first part
of the show go ahead
want to watch that on pulse a YouTube
channel that's youtube.com slash pulse
hardware um but if you're just doing
this welcome welcome to the show we have
some stuff that we like to sell in our
stores that if you buy we get money from
that and it helps us pay for things like
clothes and Who am I kidding we got all
over clothes for free motorcycle
boobs and milk motorcycles boots boots
that's what I was going to say so uh my
store is bit with top tech slash store
um I know that some of the things are
sold out right now I'm currently working
with my with my merch guy the same guy
that Paul were even on vacation because
I make it okay then in order that's fine
um but I'll be restocking stuff very
soon Paul is also selling stuff on his
store Paul's hard work on that stuff
lots of stuff just buy all the things
buy all the things on both of our stores
it's great it's really high quality so
these cities great we let you might be
like yeah it's summer Paul why would I
want a hoodie do you know it in
Australia it's winter yeah it's always
winter somewhere and Australia is a
theme for today's show yep totally is
because eye-opening yeah it was a Sesame
Street yeah I think so today's show was
brought to you by the country Australia
Australia um alright let's let's just
dive into some here I'm gonna start
usually we start the second half of the
show with with a continuation of tech
news but I'm gonna switch things up here
and sort of do a little bit of a warm-up
sort of an icebreaker where Paul and I
talk about our favorite Computex tank
that we saw at Computex 2017 this year
our favorite comp UK Compu tech yes
exactly that's what the name of the
segment is Compu tech compound yes come
to kissed that's very sorry in Czech
phonetic spelling but um with the s by
the way anyone who's donating in chat
right now we will be answering all the
messages or questions that you attach to
those donations at the end of this half
of the show so feel free to go crazy go
ham on that um all right Paul
what was your favorite thing to context
or some of your favorite things I don't
remember
wow I was I was like what a dramatic
pause and then he's gonna hit me with
like this Gloria saying okay okay okay
it's impractical practice right let's
talk about something practical here okay
fantex Eclipse p300 yes mmm I agree I
thought that was a nice nice piece
hardware the mm-hmm fantex
after coming at CES and being like look
at this case we made the fantex p400
know the enthu elites you're the open
nine hundred oh yes here's this thousand
dollar crazy top-end blah blah blah
over-the-top thing which most people
were like wow that looks pretty cool no
way I'm ever even going to touch
anything like that
sixty dollars they did a really cool
thing I felt like with the with the body
it's just one of those design elements
where they took what is essentially the
single piece of steel that they wrap
around for the bottom of the case and
they just continue to wrap it up the
side which meant that that single piece
is the base as well as the PSU shroud
and that's also the external piece on
that side right they have a smallish
piece of tempered glass that just sits
right on top of their basic you know
design for that painted black interior
only comes with a single hundred twenty
millimeter fan but sixty bucks and it
looks like a really solid starter case
that anyone could build a nice looking
computer in and not have to worry about
spending outer bucks or something like
that on it small ATX as well what I
really like to see it actually then make
a micro ATX version of that just make it
like 2 inches shorter and micro ATX
that'd be pretty sweet yeah I feel like
there should be more micro ATX
motherboards you know I feel like
there's been a dearth of those lately I
feel like mini ITX has really taken off
and obviously ATX is sort of the
standard but I feel like micro ATX
started gets left behind in a sense at
least for the few you know the current
generations and stuff from from Intel
and AMD grandeurs like be 50 be 350
boards from Thrifty be 50 boards from
from AMD and stuff Verizon CPUs that are
micro ATX but I don't know I feel like
it it could use a little bit more love
that important factor and and I feel
like that would also bring on a bunch
more
protects options in the chassis market -
I agree with that I feel like there are
a lot of good budget cases right now for
ATX not so many and even for ITX not so
many for micro ATX I agree with that
another another cool budget case not
quite as inexpensive as the P 300 but
also very compelling was the the Enzo
from BitFenix honestly I feel like I
haven't really kept my eyes on BitFenix
and what they've been doing in the last
year or two but the Enzo really caught
my eye I did a video on it at the event
and it was pretty impressive
I mean 79 bucks $80 price point for the
Enzo and it looks fantastic
I mean you see in the video it looks
great it looks even better in person
it's got some addressable RGB
implementation at the front this is it
um yes that's it
so that bad that comes stuck you have to
include that already comes with it $79
case it looks absolutely fantastic
there's a tempered glass side panel nice
power supply shroud for meets function
in this sort of you can see wifey sauce
just kind of trolling in the background
drinking our coffee a little bit of an
Easter Egg there but a fantastic looking
case that um is really nice just just
being a total troll right now you can
even do some custom water cooling it
overall a very fantastic little little
chassis there's a 240 millimeter support
for a radio at the front I'm compatible
with ACS stressfull RGB LEDs and all
that jazz so I thought it was I thought
it was a nice nice offering um kind of
refreshing as it has a nice like
stylized look that's not too
over-the-top
kind of minimalistic so um what's the
other things that I saw at Computex um
from a graphic standpoint really wasn't
expecting much from from the video card
sector just because memory I was hoping
to see something a little bit more
tangible from Vega yeah like it's either
one that was on the like ready to go but
not quite not really yeah would you
would you which is fine because I'm
looking okay they're just finalizing
some things they're really taking their
time with they're not trying to rush
things like some competitors we know but
the zotac booth I went to so Tech and
they had a mini GT X 1080 TI that was
eight point three inches long I believe
dual fan design which is just cute it's
Dora Bulls o Tech is a pretty known for
for some pumping out some mini some mini
GPUs okay gtx 980ti this is
probably the smallest yet most powerful
car that we've seen as of yet which is
pretty exciting they're still working on
the thermals they said it was hitting
like 82 degrees Celsius at the hottest
and they're trying to rework that so
that they can get it down to like the
mid to high 70s yeah which i think is
acceptable um but I could I could see a
lot of possibilities with this
especially with like you know a lot of
mini ATX cases that um you know are uh
are getting really popular these days
like I think they had done away with the
yellow as well on the back plate
yeah no yellow I'm I'm glad about that
too I'm cool with that
nice we haven't we haven't seen a card
this small with dual eight pin PCIe in a
washer that did one up a lot of the PCB
space yeah actually that they have done
some interesting things to get the PCB
down to that size for this for this GPU
for example the heat pipes there you can
see they've kind of bent them like sort
of vertically that kind of like bend up
I guess you know originally they were
sort of flat down there older cards and
they've kind of bent them to decrease
the the actual length of that it takes
up they've also done away with like
frilly things like the RGB controller
and the fan stop controller so even
though this doesn't use ero decibel at
you know low idle states anymore
it does allow them to free up more room
on the PCB so that they can actually
shorten it customize it to be the size
that it is so that's kind of cool and
who cares I don't really don't mind it
it doesn't have RGB especially if you're
gonna be slim though no fan stop mode no
fan stop mode but the fans seem
relatively quiet for what I could tell
at the booth just play my ear up to it
actually I didn't have it running
nevermind I don't unpack about um but
you know fun stuff there I J like jog ah
let's see anything else anything else
you want to talk about what Paul what
else did you fancy at Computex this year
um well we already talked about it a
little bit on my half of the show but it
was really cool seeing an x3 99
motherboard um in the flesh right there
four four four
Rison thread ripper whenever that comes
out um also cool that AMD's got an LG a
platform going on I mean I know that's
just kind of one of those I think I
didn't know it's less significant
it's compared to like a lot of the other
things like how many cores it's gotten
raw power and everything like that but
um it's cool for some reason to see AMD
with an LGA part coming in especially
having over 4,000 pins on the socket
that's pretty crazy - yeah it's also
nice to see you know Asus already
working with them to have a high end
zenith board that they've got um you
know that looks like it's pretty much
ready to go
um right who knows who knows how long
it's going to be in be same summer time
is when a thread Ripper is going to
launch an X 299 so should be within the
next couple months
theoretically yeah when does summer
actually end when does the first day of
fall that's let's turn that over first
day of fall told your room Friday
September 22nd ember alright so they
could they could push it as far as
September 21st right
that's their that's their deadline June
July August September sets about three
months so it could be anywhere within
the first the next three months but
that's still pretty good and that means
they would be still hitting well within
the well well prior to the Black Friday
and the holiday timeframe and even
within enough time theoretically to
launch before the back-to-school rush
which is kind of the first retail rush
that happens when when people start
spending more money towards the end of
the year right um but yeah that's cool
other than that's what what else I don't
know um was your favorite case favorite
case yeah you checked out a bunch of
cases um I liked seeing the new the new
the new half than that yeah that's one
case I didn't get out you didn't see
that not to get to check it out I have
you know time let's see if I can 0t
imple where is here here's one of my
videos liked on your channel
Gideon gave me a moment just a moment
where'd it go
here it is the half
so um so Coolermaster is they've redone
their naming scheme you're gonna jump I
gotta jump ahead jab head jump on her
that's all the purpose so I've redone
the naming scheme so they still have
just they're calling everything master
cases still yeah
so there's master case and then there's
there's three five and seven three is
mid is micro five is full tower seven is
I'm sorry five is mid tower seven is
full tower okay so half is going to
start with H okay so H five hundred
means half mid towers an hour I don't
know what's P means and that was it
explained to me but there's P and they
tower but they're still P all right so I
am a big fan of large fans I'm a you're
big fan fan
they're just yeah big fan fan and that's
what the haps been all about before so
these two fans in the front or 200
millimeters they're new two hundred
millimeter fan with RGB in there they
were very quiet obviously it's a loud
floor environment they're like it's on
the comfortable red everything so hard
to say exactly but big fans typically
can move more air while spending at
lower rpms that's just kind of one thing
something that can do so it's really
cool to have the removable plates that
they have on the front and on the side
it is a plastic finish for the top piece
and the side piece here but doesn't it's
it seem like it's a it's fairly high
quality um tons of UI Oh got USB 3.0 and
2.0 up there on the front it's nice I
would be cool what I what I was missing
here is that USB 3.1 gen2 I'm not sure
if that's going to be something that can
be added on as part of the master K
series I don't know if this is something
that you that you could swap out a panel
for or something like that right but the
top piece and the front piece here both
just kind of like pop off kind of like
the the master mastercase pro 6 that I
worked with recently it's really easy to
remove then they have a covered
completely covered bottom panel here
down by the
for the power supply the option to break
out the graphics card and put it
sideways here so you can have a better
look at it temper glass side panel
window and then again like just that
integrated RGB controls it just seems
like a nice looking case those look nice
this is the cosmos see 700 which was
also there which is a full tower much
larger case and this one was unique in
that it had a curved tempered glass side
panel which is kind of cool also a
unique kind of color control option
therefore controlled an RGB s and a
pretty cool building there I don't I
just like the half a little bit more
just because the the cosmos is is really
large Apple Tower right and I tend to I
don't know it's been a while since I've
really wanted a massive full tower
system I feel like unless you're doing
some insane custom water cooling I can't
justify saying custom water cooling or
like I need a Vedic 'old Rebbe yeah
exactly
you know plus a bunch of other things or
some cards or whatever yeah but yeah oh
oh and a half they don't know the price
yet but they were talking in the 130 to
150 dollar price range okay which for
what you get there seems seems pretty
nice yeah especially but I mean I
believe it comes with the least the two
front fans and a couple our top and rear
fan included yes I mean and having
really nice large fans included with the
case um you know that that's a lot right
yeah cool alright well I think that's a
good summary just briefly of what we
what we would cut our I at Computex this
year so let's go ahead and jump into
some of the tech news and discussion
that we have lined up here the first
thing on the list is I kind of wanted to
just sort of address the whole X 299
situation with sky like X and KB like X
and you know obviously a lot a lot of
other youtubers and just journalists
like Press websites have weighed in on
this topic including you know Jay from
Jays two cents and Linus which you
brought the video up already which
already has like you said almost two
million views so this is sort of a viral
topic here that I feel like we could we
could address on the show
and we've already sort of talked about
it briefly on your half but just to go
into more detail about just sort of our
thoughts our opinions on on what what
intel has done right and what they've
sort of you know missed the mark on one
thing I feel like we didn't really
address too much well we briefly just it
was the whole raid paywall with with a V
Rock yes which is um you know the the
ability to raid multiple SSDs nvme SSDs
that need to be Intel based SSDs in
order to be bootable which is already
sort of a strange restriction it seems
kind of anti-consumer additionally if
you wanted to do so so raid zero comes
free out of the gate but if you want to
do let's say raid 1 or a 10 you have to
pay $100 for a dongle that you plug into
your motherboard in order to support
that and we've we've talked about you
know that sort of technology competing
with Intel's own enterprise market which
is understandable but it just seems like
a slap in the face to consumers who want
to take advantage of these of these of
these technologies without having to go
the enterprise route because there are
people who want to raid one or a 10 or
even raid 5 that aren't necessarily
small business they're just regular
consumers maybe power users like me or
you or your I and then $300 I believe is
for the dongle that supports raid tens
or just if you just want armed sorry
raid 5 if you want raid 5 you have to
pay $300 for a little dongle these are
these are rumored values by the way
rumored values of course that are you
know obviously still subject to validity
but usually the situation is rumors like
this are either a the company in
question is putting out feelers so
they're kind of suggesting this to kind
of see what people's reaction is or be
yes that's exactly what they intend to
do and it's just leaked a little bit
early so that's that's kind of what
we're dealing with right now but yeah in
particular for the raid situation it
just seems like something that has been
just there in a veil
for people to do when it comes to the
SATA can raid configurations that intel
has made available for people for quite
some time going back to Scott Sandy
Bridge able I believe you know where as
now having to pay to take advantage of
what is a pretty cool feature vrock or
virtual raid on CPU which allows you to
take basically an expanding number of
MDOT to nvme SSDs whether you're
connecting them directly to the board
itself via MDOT two slots are you got
two slots or you're using breakout cards
like the Asus card the dim Donna that
they used Asus also has dimmed that too
but they're tired specifically about the
cipher in bat to card here which allows
you to add four more MDOT to nvme
devices and also allow them to be
addressable and configurable by the
motherboard using the CPU as kind of the
brains of the RAID controller and also
to set that up as a raid configuration
that can be bootable right which is nice
which is a very nice configuration atom
which a lot of people want to be able to
do so how much functionality you get on
the motherboard aside from this when it
comes to raid configurations with rapid
storage technology I think is a big
question and again whether or not Intel
is actually going to be requiring people
to pay a hundred bucks for using raid
one or three hundred bucks to use raid 5
is a big question and something that I
think people should hold Intel
accountable for if that's something that
they're planning to do again this is
kind of rumor right now we're not really
sure how this is going to play out and
as we talked about it might have to show
a little bit
intel has already in the information
that they've launched about core X and X
to 99 so far they have said that you
should be able to access 3 n dots who
are you dot to nvme devices with rapid
storage technology which is the pre boot
rate environment that you guys might be
familiar with if you've setup any sort
of raid configuration on X 99 or Z 270
or z170 or any of the chipset based raid
controllers and Intel sag going on for
the past four five six seven years um so
yeah and yes I am tired or JetLite yes
we're both just just don't hold us
accountable for the next 35 minutes or
so yeah um and then the other issue you
know that I want to talk about so that
we should address is like K V like X and
how that sort of doesn't make much sense
I mean essentially what you have is a
glorified 7700 K or a glorified KT Lake
processor line that is being offered on
the X 299 chipset which means you're
going to have to buy a new board to
support these group support these CPUs
which don't really have doesn't seem
like they're going to have much of a
performance boost other than maybe
slightly higher clock speeds out of the
box and maybe a little bit more
overclocking Headroom but I mean the
fact that Intel has sort of I feel like
smash together these lower end KB like X
chips and these higher-end sky like X
chips on the same platform means that
motherboard manufacturers are sort of
forced to make motherboards that kind of
kind of um you know accommodate this
wide range of CPUs whether you're
talking you know sixteen PCIe lanes is
it on KB like x16 or up to 44 on the
higher end core count chips or Sony or
28 with the middle or 20 in the middle
range so any anywhere between that range
which is huge for a single platform
which means if you want to get on the KT
like X bandwagon you can potentially
you'd have to buy a motherboard that is
is really fitted for for way more than
what Kb like X on its own can offer
which means you're going to have a lot
of features on that board that you can't
utilize with with that with that
processor which also means you're going
to be spending a lot more for a
motherboard going X 299 if you are going
to be considering KT like X which is why
KB like X makes no sense you'd be
spending out the ass for a motherboard
that you're only going to you to a lot
be utilizing
part of as opposed to just buying into a
platform
firm that is tailor-made for a cpu of
that caliber
like for example coffee Lake which is
going to be more mainstream not high-end
desktop but is also going to offer you
know just a the it's not going to be
it's like you won't feel so bottle
necked I feel like it doesn't make sense
to buy a motherboard next to nine board
that has eight DIMM slots and then put
in a cable ik X CPU that only supports
dual channel memory where you can only
fit for dims into that board and you
have four dimm slots that go completely
unused and unable to be utilized and
potentially more than that you know M
about two slots that might not be
available to you with KB like X because
you're so limited on PCIe lanes like why
would you only have access why would you
have a CPU that has only 16 PCIe lanes
on a platform that is really supposed to
be fitted for for maximum expandability
when it comes to different peripherals
and storage options you're going to be
basically you know beat it doesn't make
any sense
you're gonna have em bout two slots you
can't use you can have DIMM slots that
you can't use so you're paying more for
a board that you can't use so yeah and
like I was saying you only get a dual
channel memory controller integrated
with the cable X K be the X processor so
one of the things that I was kind of
surprised to see well not surprised to
see but startled me I guess when I first
saw it was the configurations that you
have so this isn't this is an apex board
from Asus which is an X 299 board which
has four dimm slots which they
specifically did because using fewer
DIMM slots allows for better memory
overclocking since it's a cable like X
CPU
they are only populating two of the DIMM
slots on one side that's the way it
works when you have KB Lake X with a
quad channel configured motherboard you
only use two of the you'll need M slots
on one side of the CPU so there's two
more DIMM slots on the opposite side of
the CPU here those are basically useless
with the cable a hex process it's just
not that's not symmetrical at all it's
not symmetrical yeah
but it also means that you could buy an
X $2.99 motherboard with four dimm slots
which some of them have and a KB like X
CPU and end up with two DIMM slots
available instead of what you would have
on a z2 70 motherboard which is
typically going to be at least four
unless you're talking Mini ITX or
something like that
right so it does seem very cut down on
what is like what you're going to be
able to plug into the board so it just
seems like worth X 299 where you're
probably going to be spending at minimum
$200 on a motherboard and that's
probably going to be the lowest lowest
end motherboard possible yeah most XA
and motherboards are probably going to
be 250 plus 250 or more if you put in
keep it like X processor into it you're
not going to get the full functionality
of that board so it's going to be really
difficult to say yeah here get this KB
like X 7740 X or whatever the CPU is
called and you know this X 299 board and
and you're getting you're getting a good
value for the money because what you
could equivalently get with a 7700 kiz
270 motherboard seems like it would be a
much better deal with what's available
there and what you pay for the
motherboard and the fact that you're not
basically paying for extra functionality
on the board that gets shut off because
you only have 16 PCIe lanes to work with
versus 28 or 44 yeah now all that said
here is my assessment of like alright
I'm going to try to take intel side on
this for a second okay
until side of this and let me ask you
guys who are watching this if Intel were
to present it this way would it change
the way that you're that like your
feelings about this platform your
initial perception because again we're
still at least a few weeks off from
anyone coming out with independent
reviews of these CPUs or of these
motherboards or anything like that
so please bear that in mind a lot of
what we're talking about right now is
reaction to the specs that have been
laid out by Intel and it's not
unwarranted there's still there's
definitely tons of stuff to be upset
about but we're still ways off from
actual independent reviews so what if
Intel were to say this KB Lake X is four
overclockers what if they just came
straight out and said that you know what
we understand we're not expecting a lot
of people to get K be like X CPUs we're
not expecting huge sales in that realm
but what we did was we took a KB leak X
processor we took the KB leak die
we removed the GPU from it the AI GPU
from it which again you could look at
both ways you can look at it as like oh
now I'm losing more functionality of
like quick sync and stuff and stuff like
that that's viable but what if they said
well we're not worried about that if you
want quick sync go Z to 70 they said we
remove the eye GPU from it we increase
the TDP we dropped it into a platform
that is by and large going to have
better power delivery that's made for
much higher end processors and guess
what you're going to get 10 to 40%
better overclocking Headroom out of this
chip and we know even for most people
who are buying this at home that makes
no sense this is for overclocking world
records I mean that's what we designed
this for that's what it's made for
that's we're marketing it for they
haven't said any of this mind you but
what if they did would that change your
perception of it would you instead think
of this processor is being like oh why
did they do this it makes no sense it's
confusing it's it's it muddies the
waters of this platform
maybe you think like oh well those are
just there for people to be like hey we
just hit 5.7 gigahertz on air or we just
hit 7.7 gigahertz on a 77 40k X or
whatever the CPU is which no one's come
close to which is at 7700 K would that
make more sense to you I mean if they
could guarantee 10 to 40% I thought you
have them throwing in that number
changes a bit changes things a bit right
as soon as you start throwing out hard
numbers then it's like okay well
you can measure things a bit more
accurately and precisely so I mean yeah
if they can say like 40% more
overclocking they're going to be there's
gonna be a you know definitely a market
for that people who just want to push
things as high as they can go
who are going to invest in a more
expensive motherboard just to hit those
higher clock speeds and maybe milk that
that frame rate just a bit more I can
understand that but they're they're not
the thing is like they're not ready to
say that yet I feel like there's they're
not saying that but yeah they're not and
okay I could say that but they didn't so
I feel like that's the issue I have it
so far well it's it's so and this goes
back to them to Intel being sort of
Intel sort of rushing this whole thing
right I'm sort of rushing this thing as
not so much like some some premeditated
plant they've had in the works for for
the last six months or they'll even the
last few weeks but just sort of a
reactive type of move sort of a
marketing sort of a reactionary thing
where where Intel is feeling threatened
by AMD and so they've kind of just
blasted all their cards on the table
even though they're really not ready to
play them and I feel like if they had
more concrete specs I mean they don't we
that they've announced you know they're
they're 14 to 18 core processors like
like through here already but we're not
even going to see them till six months
down the line plus and so there that's a
rumor that's a rumor that's this is this
is a rumor I mean we've heard rumors
from from Asus reps and things like that
but the the fact is is that Intel
doesn't seem to really know a hundred
percent of what they can offer it seems
like the marketing reps at Intel went to
the engineers and said so AMD thread
ripper was just announced and they have
this you know 16 core 32 thread like
what's what's the highest core count
that we could get away with saying on
paper to our audience and then engineers
were just like well theoretically I
guess we could probably do 18 cores and
so the marketing team was like yes great
awesome
and then engineers are probably like but
we don't really know anything else about
like that's probably like that's the
only spec we can give you right now and
Intel marketing was just like it we
don't care
18 cars is good 18 course 32 threads
will go to the market with that we'll
present out of context that's like two
cores higher than what then what thread
Ripper is and we don't know that we
don't know the TDP we can't tell them
the turbo clocks 36 36 beds sorry
36 divides whatever Devils in the
details all of that but I just feel like
because this is such a rush thing that
your proposition makes a lot more sense
where if Intel could give us the
specifics of what their their new
platform could achieve that would
instill a bit more confidence in the
end-user right because it means like oh
they're actually on top of their game
they actually know what they can offer
whereas now it seems like they're sort
of dangling something on a string but
they're they're trying to reel us in
before we really see the full picture
before they're able to give us the whole
story so I feel like there's there's you
know it's a bit dishonest to the the end
user in a way simply because Intel
doesn't want to look like they're you
know second-best to to AMD but certainly
any and yes and when it comes to the the
high-end CPUs that again were announced
by Intel but don't seem like they're
ready they seem like it seems very very
very much like a paper launch and very
much like them trying to get something
out there that can be a counter to the
thread Ripper CPU that AMD seems to have
you know somewhat ready to launch but I
mean you can also look at Intel and what
they've been developing on the server
side for many years and what they've had
on the Xeon with with Zeon's for quite
some time which is which is steadily
increasing number of cores on the CPUs
so they've been able to make CPUs with
massive numbers of cores like that's not
something that is challenging for Intel
porting it to the consumer side selling
it at a price that makes sense to
consumers without at the same time
hurting their server-side business I
think is the challenge that they're
going through right now but I think when
it comes to the cable ax stuff at the
low end I think people see that as just
something that is confusing and
something where they're like alright
is Intel really trying to sell that to
me right now and I think as reviewers
who you know our job is typically to
take a product test it see how it
performs and say here's where this fits
within the the consumer space right now
here is where this product makes sense
for you at home if you're going to
invest X number of dollars into a new
computer or something like that and I
think that's why cabling X is hanging
people like so it's like so confusing
and difficult to swallow for so many
people because because it's because it's
coming for the point of like is Intel
really does Intel really think they can
sell us this and I think you and I and
most people who are familiar with the
space would say no they're gonna have a
really hard time selling KB like X to
people and we're gonna have a really
hard time recommending it to people
because I'm gonna have a really hard
time saying yet invest that money in X
$2.99 motherboard and then get a fork or
four thread CPU like I'm not I'm going
to say that but I guess all I'm saying
with that is like I feel like if Intel
were to change the way that they're
framing at least those KB like X CPUs
treat them more as as sort of a unique
little extra that's been tacked on to
this that's that's less of a focus than
like the rest of the stuff the hike or
count powerful processors that we've
kind of come to understand as being
fitting for the high end desktop
platform from Intel I think it might at
least clear up some confusion on that
but again I like that's just speculation
I have no idea if Intel has any plans on
treating it that way do you think
there's a strong chance that initially
before thread river was announced that
Intel initially planned K be like X to
just be launched on Z 270 as sort of a
KB like refresh on the same platform but
once thread Ripper came in with a
completely new platform on x2 net 399
Intel felt like they had to develop
their new KD Lake processors on a
complete
new platform to stay competitive I don't
I don't think that's the case
I feel like KB Lake X has been planned
for a while I think himtell had this
idea in their head for some time now I
think the reaction to thread Ripper is
the high core count CPUs the the 14 16
and 18 core CPU is that they've
announced but again that are still
mainly paper at this point I think those
are the reaction to thread Ripper
I think KB Lake X is an idea that's been
there that they've had that they're
going ahead with because it's already
been in the works and they've already
got CPUs manufactured and that kind of
thing again I think it's the type of
thing that makes less sense but I feel
like if they were to market it in a way
that's not like hey we think you should
buy this because it's a good value but
hey we made this because we thought it
would be fun for overclockers to play
with I don't know I think that changes
at least part of the perception of that
platform but again that's up to Intel
and if they even want to say that the
other argument for KB Lake X is that
it's designed for system integrators
which is a completely other area of the
market that we who do DIY stuff
typically don't even grasp that much
because I haven't like I have no idea
how many how many computer system
integrators move like boutique
manufacturers pre-built computers I have
no idea and I'm completely aloof blind
when it comes to that area of the market
but is it enough that Intel thinks that
hey providing these CPUs on this
platform will allow system integrators
to say here person who doesn't know that
much about computers here's a quad core
eight thread based computer that we're
selling you and they probably don't even
care about the socket or the chipset or
anything else going on in there they
just care about a few basic facts such
as core counts and memory that you know
their friend who's into computers told
them about they're like the Apple users
of the PC world I mean yeah potentially
to some degree but you know system
integrate integrators that's that's
another side of it that's the other side
that's been explained to me is this
the reason why cable a hex exists it's
for the dark and again I don't fully
grasp that and I don't fully understand
how that can be sold to people who don't
who might be less familiar with the
internals of a computer but that's just
that's that's what's been explained to
me so so far so ya gave you like X cable
again when you don't know what you're
doing or or really awesome overclocking
see that's I don't know no no no I just
like I feel like there must be some
Intel marketing people out there right
now who saw who seen in Linus's video
who are kind of like in that realm of
like hey public perception of this isn't
going so well right now and and I I
guess I'm saying is I feel like that
would be a way to market that wouldn't
be immediately shadowed and shat upon by
our viewers and everything yeah actually
yeah yeah all right moving on though I
feel like we gave that a good talk good
talk Paul good talk yes become let's
move on to some sky like X news and
other news we're talking about the
actual a couple models now within the
sky like X family that have had their
benchmarks leaked online via geek geek
bench the Geekbench 3 database has
revealed some some telling benchmarks of
the 7800 X and the 7820 X both core i7
skylake Hicks processors this article
comes from WCC F Tech so take it with a
grain of salt
in other words um so just just for
starters let's talk about some of the
specifics here within skylake X starting
with the core i7 7800 X this is more of
the entry-level six core 12 thread
Scylla kicks processor with a base clock
of 3.5 gigahertz boosting up to 4.0 and
we've got eight point two five megabytes
of l3 cache quad channel memory support
with 28 PCIe lanes when overclocked in
the 7800 X scored 60 134 points in
single threaded performance and single
row tests and 37 thousand three hundred
and forty four points in multi-threaded
tests now the main competitor as a
now to the 7800 X on the AMD side is
would be the risin 5 1600 X since it
also sports six cores and 12 threads but
rolls in at a hundred and twenty dollars
u.s. cheaper so technically the 1600 X
would be the more cost-effective chip
that scored the 1600 X scored fifty nine
hundred and fifty six points in single
threaded tests and thirty six thousand
and sixty one points in multi-threaded
tests and this again is with both CPUs
overclocked the 1600 X mind you was
heavily overclocked to five point four
gigahertz and you know obviously the
stock results were a little bit less
we're quite actually significantly less
than what the overclocked ones were able
to achieve but at the end of the day the
78 7800 X again based on these rumored
specifications 70 7800 X had a three to
four three to four percent lead over the
stock 1600 X in single threaded and
multi-threaded but is 56 percent more
expensive so if we're reading this right
let's assume that the rumors are true
just for the sake of argument that
doesn't seem like a great value to pick
up a 70 70 100 X which is only going to
be a few points higher in performance
over a 1600 X but is it going to cost
over 50 percent more now bear in mind
that Rison does have on the CPU itself
ate fewer PCIe gen3 lanes but that's not
going to affect everyone but that's just
again these are just the results that
we're seeing right now with with these
rumored benchmark leaks the core i7 78
20 K which is our 780 20 is a K or X X X
X sorry I was at the typo there 78 20 X
which is the fastest guy like X 8 core
16 thread model this is a bumping up
from the 7800 quite a bit
double the I'm sorry to 2 extra cores
and 4 extra threads this is a $600 CPU
from Intel with a based in boost clock
up sigma33 point 16 Hertz and 4.3
gigahertz respectively the max boost 3.0
clock frequency is 4
point five gigahertz again that's on up
to two cores optimized and and this is
also sort of a thing that we were kind
of criticizing about skylake X
particularly with the CPU it's an 8 core
model that has only 28 PCIe lanes where
the last generation in Broadwell II that
8 core model had 44 44 44 44 40 PCIe
lanes so it seems like a big step
backward here if you were to you know be
able if you wanted that extra that extra
bandwidth for for you know additional
expansion cards peripherals m2 u2 SSDs
and so forth but besides the point
this is $100 this to this chick this
$600 chip is $100 more expensive than
the competing Rison 7 1800 X on the AMD
side which has the same core and 8 same
core and thread count
8 and 16 respectively the 78 20x scored
6034 points in single throat of tests
and 47,000 and 32 points and
multi-threaded tests respectively or
multi throw tests versus the 1800 X
which got forty three hundred and eighty
seven and three thirty four thousand six
hundred and forty seven points in the
same runs respectively single and multi
core multi thread applications the
overclocked 7820 K R I'm sorry of
seventy-eight 20x scored thirty nine
percent higher in single threaded and 35
percent higher in multi-threaded tests
than the 1800 X and it costs twenty
percent more so technically this seems
like again if these rumors are true in
these benchmarks are legitimate that the
the 78 20x seems to be at this point a
better value over the 1,800 X then the
7800 X would be over the 1600 X so
there's that there's that and then
finally they did they were able to find
some links benchmarks in the database
for Geekbench 3 on the core I 970 900 X
which is $1,000 CPU 10 core 20 threads
so it's technically replacing the 6950 X
from Intel
is the Broadwell e-equivalent corn
thread count which was let's see what
sixteen seventeen hundred dollars at its
launch so this is technically six or
seven hundred dollars lower at launch
but seems to perform a little bit better
actually nine percent faster in single
threaded and multi-threaded tests and
Geekbench 3 then the 6950 x4
significantly less dough so it seems
like the seventy nine hundred x again if
the rumors and benchmarks that we're
talking about are true but the seventy
nine hundred x core i nine seems to be
the best value over the 7820 X and the
7800 X with with the seventy eight
seventy eight hundred X seemingly being
the worst the worst value of the bunch
but those are the three CPUs on the sky
like X side of things that have been you
know more or less tested against the
rise and counter parts or even their
internal Intel counterparts but I guess
the the main point here is that things
look promising at least for the
performance you know if you are going to
go the sky like X route definitely sky
like X makes a lot more sense right now
than Katy like X which we're still
trying to justify the reason for however
obviously we're not going to really know
that the true benchmarks until these
processors reach us the reviewers the
correct series itself is under NDA until
the 12th of this month and the you can't
really purchase any of them until the
26th of the June and on that date on the
26 you're only be able to purchase for
four of those Skellig X
CPUs the other the the rest of them will
be later on later on months months away
the the high-end are the high court
count the HCC chips are not quite ready
this month launch will only speak for
the lower core count processors on
scaling X I don't know anything about
what you're talking about right now
Oh neither do i I I did I said nothing I
don't know any of that I thought we
already discussed that on the show but
maybe apparently we didn't deny this is
all just speculation these are all
random thoughts and theorems always said
is this stuff's probably coming out in
the next few weeks
yes that's what I said I'm reading these
dates from the Artic that's the WCC EFT
art tech articles completely false yeah
it's stupid why are we still cite them
anymore um all right moving on to our
next story before things go south even
more a thread river thread repair Andy
thread Ripper proposed again this is a
rumor this could easily be the rumor
mill segment of today's show a thread
Ripper is to cost eight hundred and
forty nine US dollars um so I'm
blackmailing me in comments stop
blackmailing jack go away I hate all of
you um all right so this is articles
from tech power up and they're just
saying hey there's rumor out that AMD
thread ripper might be eight hundred and
forty nine dollars this would be the
entry level this speaks for the entry
level 16 core chip eight forty nine the
thread Ripper 1998 will come in at 3.2
gigahertz with a 3.6 gig gigahertz boost
155 watt TDP and is absent of X afar so
you don't get any of that extreme
framerate benefits there um this would
be an insane an insane truth if it were
true as it this would make the entry
level editor frequency range accepted
free I don't always take seven frames
sorry jet lag what I planned the jet lag
plus the beer extended frequency range
whatever it's all the same um this
would be insane if it were true and $50
price point for 16 core CPU would put
would put Intel I'm sorry AMD's CPU
cheaper than Intel's 10 core 7900 X so
that would be too few recourse for fewer
threads but it would be more expensive I
mean because the cheese Jesus a thread
Ripper is if it were $850 there would be
a lesser Intel CPU that would compete
with it for a hundred and fifty dollars
more because the 7900 X is a thousand or
a portly going to be a thousand bucks so
again this is all speculation the rumor
we don't know I'm not breaking any NDA's
by talking about this right now
um so I don't know that I mean
wishful thinking I suppose I would
assume that we're all hoping that it's
gonna be edited $4 that'd be cool it
remains to be seen you know these these
rumors so I feel like sometimes the
rumors are just so on point where
they're not even rumors like someone
just got the information straight from
the source and they just know and they
just leaked it and then other times
rumors are just way off base and they're
just sort of like to grab views and have
no have no foundation or validation
whatsoever so it's hard to say at this
point how expensive an entry-level
thread Ripper CPU would cost but $850
for what it's worth is pretty compelling
if aim D can pull off that price point
so on that note let's talk about our
last article here let's do a little
change of pace you ever talk about Intel
and AMD CPUs pretty much the whole time
here yeah awesome hardware let's let's
blitz up let's take a step back here and
talk about something completely
different which is fans let's talk about
the fans Paul not not you fans will talk
about the fans made by not to us
specifically this was one booth or one
the exhibitor that I did not get a
chance to check out at copy text this
year however they were showing off some
pretty cool stuff and PC gamer was able
to get the scoop on their latest
creation which is their a series line of
new PC fans um it's very exciting
actually
these fans these a series fans have been
in development at Noctua for over four
years with over 200 prototypes being
tested and rather than stick with common
PBT plastic for their fan blades not to
ax is going to be using what they call
sterics material which is a liquid
polymer related to Kevlar it's very
tough the molecular chain structure of
this material is fairly ordered already
in the liquid state when you push it
into the injection mold and I'm
definitely you're citing a lot of this
verbatim because I don't understand it
fully and it gets to a very organized
structure once it hardens out in the
mold basically it's a lot more stable of
a material it doesn't have the tendency
to shift or change shape once it's been
in use for several months or years for
example we will talk about more that
more about that insect whereas
conventional polymers are complete
chaotic in the liquid state and solid
state this matters because the aligned
molecular molecular structure gives it
more rigidity way more rigidity
so actually what PC Gamer was saying is
that when you actually feel the fan
blades themselves you don't get any sort
of flex like you do with regular PBT
plastic it's it's much more sturdy it's
a lot denser and firmer and they're
saying that this these fans feel like no
other fan in the PC market that they've
ever felt before this is like a brand
new thing when it comes to our this this
market as using this sort of new new
polymer material for fans and engineers
actually call the sterics material in
emergency only material since it costs
about four times the amount of PBT
plastic and that basically lets us know
right off the bat this is not going to
be the a-series is not going to be a
budget fan line Noctua in general has
never been known for their cheap prices
but more so for their performance and
low noise and this is going to outdo
their existing line of fans by being
even quieter and more efficient those
are the basically the two new advantages
two main advantages of this new sterics
design so for the quieter operation
addressing quieter operation typically
with in even with included vibration
corners or pads that fans come with out
of the box there's still there's still
micro vibration that occurs on the
surface of the fan itself on the blade
itself and as as a fan blows and/or
sucks I'm not going to judge here
pressure on one side of the fan is
greater than the other than the pressure
on the other and this new material
reduces the vibration thus lessening the
noise output so that's all it's all very
very scientific that's fairly
straightforward the other advantage of
course being efficiency via a tiny tip
clearance which is not nearly as dirty
as it sounds this is the space at the
tip clear and says basically that I
learned some new today is the space
between the fan blades and the housing
alright so you know your fan spins in
this frame this is rectangular a square
frame and the amount of gap that's
between the fan blade
itself and the housing actually has an
effect on the efficiency of the fan
itself so for example if you have a
large gap between the fan blade and the
housing then as the fan spinning
especially when it's attached to a
radiator or heatsink there's going to be
a lot more airflow that's being leaked
through that gap and that's that's more
airflow that's not being pushed through
your radiator or heatsink or whatever
fin stack that you have attached to your
fan so what not to is done with the
a-series is that they've actually
created a very very slim gap only 0.5
millimeters between the fan blade and
the housing so there's less air leakage
there's literally less air leakage when
the fan spinning so that more of that
air can pass through your fin stack and
that would theoretically increase
efficiency it's kind of interesting too
because the reason why PV T doesn't work
so well for this is because PBT blades
will actually extend I didn't really
know this maybe I did I heard about this
why are you laughing
this is science why are you laughing in
the face of science you should be
ashamed of yourself as a tech reviewer
you have no right is are you are you
about to are you about to blame the
blend the jet lag is anyone listening is
anyone listening are you a Utah are you
laughing because I'm talking about tip
clearance Oh what is it because I'm
putting you to sleep
I heard a word you said for the bus have
you literally just been completely zoned
out what have you been thinking about
have you even have been thinking at all
has this all just been sort of uh sort
of a blur to you this is like my head
take my integrity our process was
focused alike right Cal's gonna finish
talking and I just kept going I never
get I'm gonna be like yeah that sounds
good but there's only so long that you
can dose before before you just start
losing and losing your sanity
I'm sorry I'll try to wrap it I'll try
to wrap this up
shitty PBT fans that we mostly use right
now
yeah the fuck'em the fan the blades will
actually get longer did you know that
Paul really like without the use of
hallucinogens oh the fan blades will
actually extend if you use these like
shitty fans did not show you fans any
fan these days they use this plastic if
you use it for like months or years on
end they'll extend like 0.1 or 0.2
millimeters the blades will actually
extend because the tensile strength of
these blades is not nearly as as robust
as sterics material for example soma
sterics you actually don't have any sort
of fan flex and and this structure and
shape of your fan will stay static it
will remain the same in constant
throughout the entire life of the fan
which doesn't seem like a big deal but
when when when not to is trying to
decrease the the tip clearance between
the blade and the housing
you really can't allow the fan blades to
expand much otherwise they could
interfere with the housing themselves so
you know I don't even know I don't want
to continue cuz I know you're just just
going in one ear out the other right now
I'm trying here Paul I'm trying I'm jet
lag - I'm Jay I'd like to tune out
everything you're saying - you know but
I can't because it's my half the show
and anyway the a series is gonna be
great it's gonna be a great lineup stay
tuned
let's move on to pay my PC hey this is
the last segment of this half the show
good oh good oh thank god I'm done with
that story um alright yeah it'd be
really quick though this is really quick
alright torn Brian thank you very much
this is an honor of the new half case I
was innocent Computex he's been pimping
his og half 9:32 for like six years
yo x58 platform core i7 950 thirteen
fans holy crap um honestly I would say
get a new computer your all of your work
everything's dorms fine all the
customization wrote it all away
no I like I like the action figures I
think they're adorable they live a
delivery
a lot of personality I had some
character in there I see that enter max
man just straight up just dangling looks
like it's right in the middle on top of
your SD almost looks like the graphics
card has been swapped out was the 950 an
upgrade to something that required PCI
Express no the 950 is the processor core
i7 950 oh right well graphics card that
it looks like a little low-tech little
mini card maybe it's a 950 years I'm sad
is their peg connectors here that looks
like they were previously connected to a
graphics card also what's with these
clear fans the old dance what are those
they're for graphics card maybe but it's
not with you a graphics card of that
power would really need help with
airflow it's kinda confusing here you
know I'm a mishmash right for customized
original half 9:32 this this case I'd
say is worthy of like getting it and
replacing it in the system inside yeah
it's still a beginner if you gotta hang
on to that for future use
6:58 and an i7 950 is getting pretty
yeah
pretty old right but I like I like the
customization mmm nice terrace place
still probably good oh yeah these
periscope story thanks for next we got
Sasha Sasha sash it rises I have 1,600
gigabyte or is xax 370 gaming 5 a
sapphire r9 290 try X and the be quiet
silent bass 800 beautiful a compilation
of hardware there Sasha and very nice
LED implementation looks great when it's
all lit up thanks for that LED picture
at night good shot that's a really good
shot looks fantastic let's see what
we're just looking at it straight on um
it looks pretty solid all around the one
thing I would say is you could really
use some extensions on that power supply
as we often say for a lot of the
submissions we get here on pin my PC a
little bit of sleeved extensions goes a
long way my friend and I feel like in
your case I would either go with
straight black or I'd get some white
ones or you can even get black and white
ones
let's say you've got already a very
neutral color scheme here so that's
going to let itself to be pretty handy
so black and white black and/or white is
going to be
nice as far as the rest of the system
goes from an aesthetic standpoint the
only thing I could really point out here
is that the Arctic branding on your
water block for the CPU is upside down
which is not going to bother some and
it's going to drive others who are
slightly OCD like myself sometimes when
it comes to this sort of thing quite
crazy so that's the only other thing
though
I agree how do you feel about the Arctic
does it drive you insane or do you not
give a um or somewhere now now that
you've pointed out pointed it out it
would be cool to have something done
about that I think it but again to you
to do towards the end of the aesthetic
list of things to be corrected on this
computer I think it's okay as is yeah
potentially flipping it or just you know
figure out some of the solution to paint
over it or something like that could be
an option I feel like even well I don't
know if you could do with this cooler
but even like sideways I don't mind if
that if the text is like I can't go well
you might be able to sort it there the
bracket knee on the tee that's why I'm
saying yeah yeah cool for the most part
thank you very much Sasha very very nice
like a build though yeah fantastic
looking Oh Ben Ben Benjamin air-five
Hornick z170 ex-gay mning 7a 6700 K and
GTX 1060 from MSI with an H 115 i AI o
white LED Corsair AF fans those are high
airflow AF bro um let's see this is a
pretty nice looking system here I don't
know why I picked this one there's not
much to pimp here the fans all match
there's no colour clashing of any kind
um cable management looks pretty good
from what I could tell
again sleeved extensions even if you
have the flat black cables that come
with your power supply even some sleeved
black ones will look a lot better in my
opinion the graphics out a huge feel the
3.5 inch drive is upside down yeah just
fine
it actually looks okay that way it might
looking as I don't know crying it out
that's an interesting way my buddy put
in yeah because it's like black on black
sort of um the thing that stands out
about this to me is a graphics card
seems small and underpowered yes
compared
to the rest of the system yeah 6700 K
appeared with a 1060 GTX 960 just seems
sort of imbalanced um and just I don't
know like the rest of this build looks
really fierce and yet you have this
level like I don't it's like it's like a
really buff guy with a tiny penis you
know um so maybe just get a bigger penis
there you go
well put Kyle thank you Jeff El Jefe
interviews with an i-5 3470 system with
the niceties 77 motherboard 16 gigs of
ddr3 gay bi 1050 Ti yep h 105 all-in-one
a Gigabit Ethernet card to do to the
motherboard port being dead oh yes sad a
sad situation but hey triple San face a
good use of an expansion slot so glad
that you were able to still get that up
and running
yeah all right so you know not not the
most terribly high in system but uh I'll
immediately point out you've got you've
got a pretty massive all-in-one h 105 on
an i5 3470 which is not an overclockable
cpu not like the worst faux pas you
could ever do by any stretch but you've
got a hundred plus dollar all-in-one
which you like the I would have just
gotten a 3035 what is I can't remember
the SKUs for the Ivy Bridge processors
35 735 somebody canyon I've just gotten
a 35 70 K right instead of that 3470 but
maybe it was an upgrade down the line or
something like that so whatever won't
give you too much of a hard time um kale
management looks on point you have some
slightly clashing colors in here because
you have a motherboard with that light
blue aesthetic that asus was going with
back in the C 70 70 days but somehow at
least with this picture it looks pretty
good yeah I don't know whether it's the
blue white LED lights that kind of match
with that or something but the ones on
top of this case yeah yeah that doesn't
look too bad
no SSDs and again that it looks like you
have an rj45 cable coming up right here
in the middle of the case inexplicably
why why is that there
no I mean no no actually I bet that's an
LED that's an LED Oh naturally it's top
of trends it looks like an rj45 for a
second though yeah it does um see ya
Jeff I don't know what to tell you as
far as making thing looks prettier
you've got some nice sleeve cables on
here and it for your power supply take
the sticker off of your kingston SSD
okay yeah and if you want to maybe make
it a bit more unique maybe you could
like spray-paint one of those SSDs blue
and the other one red sure
any cool fun idea yeah or just
spray-paint Buzzle and black and make
them stealth yeah but hang on to your
each 105 and then upgrade everything
else what do you do when you do upgrade
goodie oh look here's a backplate other
graphics card backplate cool that's nice
thanks Jeff thanks Jeff and then finally
we have an honor of I mean the honorable
mention this is a just one system I
wanted to commend this is from Samuel
and you know it's not like the craziest
most baller doubt system that we've seen
here on pin my PC but I just feel like
he did a good job for what he had um and
it's not like you know again the most
high-end components or anything he
actually didn't even list what specs
that were rocking here but I just feel
like it's efficient oh he did I laughs I
got a 30 I did get that text play tweet
pea 8h 77 - V motherboard 16 okay of
ddr3 iron sapphire 7950 Akula master
enforcer 6-hour supply and of course 128
gig SSD with a WD 500 gig blue drive so
yeah like Cal said not by any stretch a
high-end system I mean a little bit
older but still uh you know perfectly
adequate for gaming it reminds me of I
got me pre-built almost I think it might
be the case I feel like it looks just
reminiscent of like a modern-day
pre-built maybe from MSI or something
like that primary black a couple blue
accents that go along with the blue LEDs
on the cooler in the fans you know
everything looks pretty clean I feel
like that CPU cooler really matches with
the case sort of aesthetic not familiar
with this cool I'm not either I was just
like that's a weird cooler but somehow
it works so well is it a vapor X but
somehow it works so well with the case
and just everything else that
and the graphics are everything looks
just like the appropriate amount like
the proportional amount of cheesy got
today sir in a good way
it's a vapor exploit yeah yeah okay it
almost looks like a sapphire logo anyway
that's Henry but um
yeah I mean apart from like you know you
get maybe some ketchup mustard in there
but with the blue LEDs that sort of
washes it out you can't really tell it
all um I think it's a pretty solid build
here yeah pretty solid wood consistent
let's say you've kept it clean to over
the years that's nice so thank you very
much Samuel for that thought you
deserved an honorable mention like some
but what should we do now it's eight oh
six do you think we should just dive
into sourdough nation stuffs or do more
Q and a I think we should I was just
damage donation but I because people
will ask even Matthew Murray okay you
take a Metheny way to get a start on
this um oh my god there's so many one
doesn't even start yeah what is your and
have started my hat I am going to look
for that right now
did you do okay um again there's so many
people and so many people what
what you call Kyle sir hahaha so I got
your comment self okay sorry I'm almost
done
this is the last we're on the last
stretch we're with the last stretch yeah
we need to hurry up you need to shut it
shut your face
all right I'm gonna go through these uh
go through these donations really quick
x-ray gaming five dollars chug chug chug
we are literally out of beer I have zero
beer I cannot chug right now I'll owe
you one on the next show
Adam Jager $5 thank you very much sir no
comment
Scott Dilbeck also no comment $10 thank
you Scott Bobby jr. Bobby J are $2
Abbott and Costello did who's on first
thank you Paul has already realized that
he was wrong and admits that he sucks
sigh Dheeraj Cohen asani for the 40
whatever currency that is guys try
wallpaper engine from steam for your PC
I'll bear that in mind if I don't forget
it by the end of this episode
x-ray gaming again $5 with all the black
y'all where do y'all listen to techno
where's the correlation there I've never
seen a line graph with the direct
correlation between people who wear
black and listening to techno music I I
just don't know where that comes from
but yeah I wear I listen to lots of
techno music and I wear lots of black so
there's probably some truth to that
automatic meant for the $5 hey guys
ahh you could say Andy is thread ripping
Intel a new one ha ha ha boom uh also
say hi to Bianca and Cheyenne she on
whose Bianca and Cheyenne Janka who's
that I don't know who those people are
but hi take it over Oh probably people
that you're with Matt I was like we
don't have anyone here by those names
I'm Kyle and he's Paul um delinquent
jack five Canadian just pipe it in to
say you guys are awesome I think you
might happen in Cheers though Quan
Guerrero for the hundred dollar
don't nation what goodness good Lord
love the content Kyle as for Paul I just
started to watch his channel I posted on
the pit my PC lol mine is a thermal take
the tower 900 just tell me what you
think I built it when I got bored also
my first time watching you live always
working when you're alive
awesome one I'm gonna look for your
build at some point on Twitter after the
show I'll let you know what I think
about it sure enough thank you so much
for the hundred dollar donation that's
awesome thank you on kinesin Diddy's for
the 5 bucks my remaining budget for my
GPU is 800 USD and I just have to ask
should I wait for the 1080 TI kingpin or
get what is now available for the 1080p
ah'd um kingpin is going to cost you
significantly more for probably not
terribly much more performance um III
would just go for a relatively
affordable affordable gtx 980ti
it's still good I think it's better
priced performance in the grand scheme
of things as price performance II as you
can get with a card of that caliber
again if you have the kingpin cards a
guaranteeing that you can over you can
run it at certain 2025 megahertz which
is a nice overclock for a 1080i but it's
not like an insanely good overclock for
a 1080 yet yea diminishing log returns
if you're willing to spend a lot more
money for a little bit more performance
than kingpins where you're at otherwise
go elsewhere in Dredd you for the $2
release date on fantex glacier res pump
I don't know I believe they're saying q3
for most of that stuff yeah and but you
should do it either tweet fantex check
the fan text or directly or they said
that their water cooling stuff was going
to be up on performance pcs right so
keep your eye out there Daniel drew Zach
for the $2 share some love over to Kyle
- thank you very much yeah Tom's Tom's
brim grouse prims bits a hundred a
hundred and ok what's that okay I don't
know listening every week while working
at night I have 7600 K at 5.1 gigahertz
on water and 1.31 5 volts my question is
about PCIe lanes if I put 960 Evo SSD
does that mean it steals x4 lanes for my
980ti knows because another region Crona
we've we've dealt with this before
Norwegian crota is a massive the 960
Evo that would be a sada but 1909 she's
really done - ah so yes it would steal
for links technically from your API I
believe that's correct right uh yeah no
I mean it it can run on nvme it can run
a PCI gen3
by - but it will be you wouldn't the man
it is made to run a PCIe gen3 by four
right and so yeah you'd want to avoid
limiting the bandwidth to possible
indeed um and then we've got I love cat
weasel for the ten British pounds the
goop thank you very much Kent weasel
watch Laurel and Hardy's 1932
oscar-winning movie the music box it's
comic genius thumbs up from the UK maybe
you think it maybe I should refresher
that I will I will not mistake the
Laurel and Hardy's that's okay I didn't
know they were before this country uh
Matt Graham's for the twenty bucks
I agree micro-atx doesn't get enough
love especially on Rison asus has a Z to
70 Strix board with RGB options and it
looks really freaking good the lowly P
350 Asus boards look like iMHO you
can really tell less effort went in
absolutely and of course those boards
are also paired with lower price points
so it's sort of understandable but it
would be kind of cool to see a more sort
of a thoughtful micro ATX port that
maybe has some of the nice bling
features for once for maybe even a
little bit more money I think some some
some builders would we need a crosshair
six gene gene gene is my ex please write
a Seuss yeah good old gene um I always
think of like an old guy when I think of
gene yeah motherboard gene it's better
gene like the genes that are in your in
you G team fettering you yeah I don't
want an old guy named gene and me that's
for sure
Ryan Bisco barns for the fifty Canadian
thank you for the help with my first
build go Leafs go who are the Leafs is
that a Canadian football teams for Anto
Maple Leafs
oh the Toronto Maple Leafs I'm sorry I'm
an uncultured American well thank you
very much Ryan I do appreciate that
donation very generous of you des Jones
with the two bucks are five sixteen
and at the 350 motherboard plus EVGA for
the win32 gtx 980ti
winning yeah I couldn't agree more
I cannot dispute that whatsoever thank
you very much des Pete cotton $2 Corsair
sink it best new RGB tech or wait and
see um
I am excited for the new Corsair
software assuming that they do come out
with it because it's purportedly or
proposal II going to replace Corsair
link and Q which I think would be a good
thing instead of having three different
softwares to control all the things just
have one application to rule them all of
course there's increasingly coming out
with more RGB riddled components there
hydro series of coolers RGB strips there
cases etc memory so it makes sense to
just have one application to do
everything and the demo they showed
while it is was a concept at Computex
hopefully does surface as a end-user
product it's at some point uh the
address it to get the fanciness of the
individually addressable LEDs at least
for the time being is going to be more
of a proprietary solution that you're
going to have to invest in one company's
hardware to make it all work that said
of course here's option does seem like
the most full-featured flexible option
for controlling everything at least that
I've seen so far but yeah I mean like
you're not going to be able to take that
and have interoperability with something
like an NZXT Q or that kind of thing so
there's again there's going to be a lot
of fragmentation in that RGB market of
like versus just your typical RGB power
plug that a lot of the boards have right
now versus like individually addressable
more functions more features more
controls but yeah I mean as long as
you're willing to invest all in Corsair
stuff it does seem like they have a
pretty viable option for that indeed
next up we've got Greg Greg Greg Reid's
lost my place $20 thank you very much
Greg I hooked at my new console killer
PC to a 4k TV today nice know of a good
resource I can use to calibrate the
color also I got some good tips on
painting the case from Kyle's older
videos so thanks
you both a pic sweet I haven't seen the
tweet yet but hopefully I'll get around
to it um let's see a good resource you
can use to calibrate color I have no
idea jeez I I honestly have not done
that on any of my panels to be honest I
I know I should be shunned and crucified
at the stake but um it seems like a
simple Google search creator look at
this tech great article there you go
December 31st 2016 which is the first
year but when you search google for 4k
TV color calibration got a little google
i don't know TechRadar is a good a good
company so this is like this is how I
would start yeah I'm just getting
something that this mystery y-you guys
you've been asked this question there's
color calibration tools you can buy that
like hang down in front of the TV and
connect via USB and actually sense the
color that's on there there's probably
less expensive options to the color
calibration tools are probably going to
cost you one or two hundred dollars
often really really high ends like pro
art style color depth accurate monitors
will ship with the color calibration
tool because they're that expensive as
is indeed but uh yeah hopefully that at
least gets you started surfing on that
serpent XFX always a pleasure guys from
$10 donation Kyle how's that camera you
brought to Computex doing also z2 70
Taichi with zebb 7700 K or as gtx 980ti
and 960 Evo was this a bad investment I
bought it in February 2017 no I don't
think so
whatsoever that sounds like a fantastic
system sounds like pretty much the
fastest rig you can get right now on I
mean for that amount of money to be
honest if you're talking just pure frame
rates of 7700 K is going to actually
crush it paired with I mean that's
that's really one of the most worthy
CPUs to be paired with a GTX 280 I feel
yeah it's it's not going to bottleneck
even if you're at like GTA X 1080 I'm
sorry even if you're in 1920 by 1080 for
example not nearly as much as some of
the other competitors but the camera
that I brought with me to Computex was
fantastic the RX 105 was just an
absolute fantastic solution it was
completely what I wanted was a
lightweight package super portable easy
if in the pocket but also strapped to
say like a PCM recorder to get some
really high-quality audio when that was
attached to my wireless love setup and
it was amazing it won't be the last time
that I'm using that setup for an event
that's for sure
Sebastian Casella for the 50 a RS thank
you very much sir great coverage of
context also doubled Jenkins trademarked
- Kyle double Jenkins I'm gonna start
doing double Jenkins malice - Kyle for
pronouncing bueno satis at Argentine
peso ah yes that's right for pronouncing
Buenos Aires right on one of his
attempts in the last show nice Wow
awesome I'm glad my lease photo that
worked my pronunciation is on point
there tom revin Smith's
brems mitts for the 15 nook by the way
this is this these are Norwegian Crohn's
yes sausage and Crona yes Crona sorry
when will be next pin my pc segment
perhaps next week who knows I always
miss them and only remember when
watching the stream hopefully next week
if not next week definitely the week
after I usually do it either every week
or every other week Juan Guerrero for
another $50 donation bye guys I forgot
to ask
I run a four monitor setup and game use
using Nvidia surround on my three asus
swift PG 2 for 8 q 180 Hertz monitors
what card should I use to run games like
Battlefield 1 on next settings or the
division I have or the division I have
an msi gtx 1070 so if you have a forum
on our set up you're probably using 3
own like you said 4 surround get a gtx
980ti i would say at the very least to
run those um 180 Hertz monitor you're
probably not gonna be able to push 180
Hertz on all three of those to be honest
at 1080 over today but with with a
single 1080i
I mean battlefield 1 on max settings mmm
I don't know about that probably not but
um get two of them maybe get to 1080i
for your like for your configuration
with high frame rate that's when I guess
we basically want as much GPU horsepower
as you can handle yeah so let's start
with the 1080i right now yeah and then
maybe consider two of them consider to a
ten seventy but I would opt for a single
1080i of the horrible forcing before to
a ten seventy yeah and the motion for
the two bucks can I use a 3216 by 4 gig
ram kit with Rison 1800 X probably not
depending depends depends on the RAM kit
the - depends on what types of actual
the dedicated circuits are used on that
Ram kit if it is not a kit that is
already validated specifically for Rison
then you're probably not going to just
be able to run 3200 speed especially
with a 4 stick kits out of the box it's
just that's more of a challenge for
rising your best bets right now or to
get memory that you know works with
Rison there's some core circuits and
some g.skill kits that have been
validated for higher speeds and your
best bet is to stick with this few
memory sticks as possible so I would opt
for a 2 by 8 gig kit versus a 4 by 4 gig
kit and upgrade later maybe down the
line once compatibility improves yeah
we'll eat $10 but my first PC based on
your guys's videos couldn't have done it
without you awesome year asus asus IX
was at 9 Hero III 777 ok EVGA GTX 1080
for the win - EVGA 750 want g3 Corsair
Vengeance ok just much respects I hope I
have chosen well that's a nice system so
it's good
nice to see today so we said ok why not
you're gonna have people coming at you
telling you you should have bought a
Rison and blah blah and you could get 6
course cruisers but you know what for
gaming it's a 7700 K and your setup
you're totally fine yeah give yourself 6
months to a year and a half before you
start thinking to yourself maybe I
should get a higher cork out CPU if you
are going to do any good things other
than you know game if you're gonna be
streaming for example editing whatever
x-ray gaming for the two bucks wake up
Paul I'm trying to stay awake we're
almost done but you guys keep donating
we can answer your stupid questions
no I'm just kidding we love you all
thank you for donating right again bread
rant $20 holy crap for Paul hanging in
there well at least he tried to tell my
best he's an old man his time has come
Daniel drew Zach again for the 2 bucks
not to a fan sleeper agent active
activate what does that mean not to a
fan sleeper agents as I was falling
asleep while you were trying to explain
this stuff about this ah yes of course
yeah that's like that's like the
ultimate Paul lullaby
is a series not to a fans they don't use
the TBT into that all right the Pvt
plastic stuff is different but all the
stuff about the distance between the
fins and the thing like it's all from
last year talked about it all next guy
well it was a refresher who knows you
might have been asleep last year when
they were announcing all right Adam
Yeager $2 can you wish my wife Rachel
happy birthday happy birthday Rachel
over at their birthday you look you look
21 years young anymore
I really hope you're happy return
actually older than 21 otherwise that
would be a compliment
um Brian to Alverez $5 worth the pricing
with the pricing of the ASUS Maximus 9
code plus a core i7 SETI 700
is this a sound buy or should I wait for
the X $2.99 chipset plus Scylla combos
honestly no just good just get the disc
at the Maximus 9 code with a semi 7 okay
it's gonna be awesome
do it don't I mean unless you're unless
you're doing some really high-end
that's workstation based if you're just
gonna be gaming get the semi someone who
came I agree with Kyle if all you're
doing is gaming yeah Dylan Gregory $2
thank you for the donation Dylan Gregory
for $5 do you guys wanna get
recommendations for external optical
drives no nope they're all pretty much
the same to me yeah they all the same
yeah get one that works yep
there is a new 4k blu-ray optical drives
that just recently launched for
computers but I haven't
Asus had one at their booth they did
this year it was RGB I wasn't ready to
be optical drive fairly yeah okay III
featured in my in the outro that I did
for that that booth I didn't get that
far okay deep down the rabbit hole you
had to go Oh cotton peep gotten $5 you
guys are awesome thanks for the great
response
thank you for the donation Christian up
on $2 hey they wait and how can a fan
buy a build from you unless your local
I'm probably not gonna ship it because
it's gonna cost a lot of money and also
risk damage in the process so usually I
only you know sell or pawn off systems
for giveaways if I'm going to be
shipping it otherwise you pretty much
have to be local
sorry Bobby jr. for the 10 bucks hey
guys I'm a fairly new subscriber and I
really enjoyed both your channels just
wondering well technical back
you guys have do you guys have degrees I
don't I mean I have a degree but it's in
something completely different than
anything related to tech really I mean
as multimedia production has nothing to
do with like building pcs or knowing
about DIY hardware things like that I
pretty much learned a lot that I know
today from Paul after working more after
getting a job at Newegg about four or
five years ago now I just sort of
learning you know learning the ropes
from him and and then after breaking off
