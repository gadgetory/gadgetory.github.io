awesomesauce Network welcome back to the
channel I'm sorry I'm really sweaty
right now and not too presentable
although I'm usually not that
presentable anyway but it's freaking hot
in this house and I've been working in
the garage all morning so that's kind of
why I'm the way I am but that's besides
the point today I'm going to be focusing
on well let's say this first off this is
the first video in a series of many
videos on my custom water-cooled build
that I am planning I'm currently in the
really early stages right now so I'm
just now starting to actually take
action the first thing that I'm going to
do is I'm going to do some custom
modding now not a huge modder by any
means I actually have like no modding
experience so I'm slightly terrified
that I'm going to just f everything up
in this one run but I've done a lot of
research online I even asked some help
from guys like Bill oh and stuff like
that and this is by no means a tutorial
also so do as I say no don't even do as
I say don't do anything that I'm doing
even though I have looked into it
extensively this is my first time doing
it so this is not a tutorial this is
just me documenting my experience with
modding this particular kind of mod
which is painting I'm going to be custom
painting some stuff today which is the
thermal armor on the Z I'm sorry the X
99 saber tooth board so here's the
thermal armor that I've taken off of the
motherboard right there it's in the
defined s by the way which is the case
I'm building this epic system in so my
color scheme that I had in mind was to
do a black grey and hot pink build I
know you're probably like what hot pink
who-who are you Linus but that's that's
not the reason why I'm doing it
as much as I love lies I'm actually
doing it just just for myself I think
that color scheme has not really been
seen too much in the custom modding
community and you know I'm kind of sick
of seeing the red blue green black and
white type stuff so I just thought I'd
do something different so that being
said I'm going to do some painting on
this Thermal Armor it's very easy to mod
I would think very easy to paint because
it's removable obviously
you like you can see but I'm going to
keep the black in there like I said
black is one of the theme colors so I'm
going to keep that sexy black finish
right there I'm not going to touch that
I'm actually going to mask all of the
black off it's just this upper region
and this side region right here that
I'll be spray-painting over I'm going to
be spray-painting that in gray I think
going pink with that is a little bit too
bold and if you're worried that this is
going to look like a piece of bubblegum
when it's all done don't as far as the
computer goes because the only thing
that's really going to be pink in the
system is the fluid and I've got the
fluid right here it's from mayhem it's
Mayhem's pastel perfect pink and I can
take the cap off really quick hold on
check this out
yeah feet for the win alright so I'm
gonna show you guys the color of this
pink I'm going to bring it to the
surface just a bit so you can see it
making sure not to drip it all over my
parents carpet or my grandparents carpet
so there it is it's nice nice vibrant
pink right there and I think that's
going to match pretty well with the
black and gray so I'm pretty excited
about that I have done some test
painting already that's when I was doing
this morning in the garage and I
actually painted a couple fans the other
two were downstairs so I can't show them
to you but this is the first one I faded
I left the blade as is it was already
gray was a full black fan but I painted
the frame in gray now this isn't the
gray that I'm gonna use but it is very
similar I actually ran back to the
hardware store because it wasn't the
exact gray that I wanted this is a
little bit darker than the shade that I
was looking for but I think the paint
job came out pretty nice the brand
amusing is I think it's rust rust Oh
something it's super popular you guys
probably know it right away but and you
know what I'm gonna put the cap on this
before I knock it over and cry myself to
sleep because I would do something like
that
the first thing I'm going to do today
and into this video because I'm going to
save the fans for a later video
spray-painting all those today I'm just
going to be focusing on the thermal
armor for for the the x9 saber-tooth and
the first step I need to do is mask off
all the black stuff so I don't get any
overspray and then I'm just gonna go to
town and spray this bitch and it's going
to look awesome
hopefully I'm actually really scared
that I'm gonna mess it up so yeah let's
let's go ahead and mash this off and
let's
all right so here's the Thermal Armor
all masked off with the painters tape
that I had looking pretty good as you
could probably tell from the time-lapse
I was also using a straight razor with a
brand new blade and a very small
flat-head screwdriver just to help me
get all the edges and cut away any
unwanted tape so I get really smooth
lines and it's looking pretty nice also
you want to make sure that you wipe it
down with a tack cloth before you start
spray painting this just gets off all
the dust little particles as well as
finger oils that are on your subject
before you start painting because once
you paint over that stuff it's pretty
much on there for good so pro tip right
there actually amateur tip that the pros
use because I am an amateur but the pros
also do it this is the paint I'm using
it's a EXO rust professional primer and
yeah it's pretty good I actually did
another test spray on this fan this is a
different fan than the one I showed you
you can see here I spray-painted the
blades this time let me go ahead and
turn the aperture up so you can actually
see there it is so that's the the finish
that I'm going for that's that's the
coat that would be doing for the thermal
armor I could have used one or two more
coats but I just kind of wanted to get a
feel for the color but the quality of
the paint is really good and hopefully
with a steady hand
I can achieve the same results oh and
one more thing I should mention this
hanging contraption I have here with a
cat5 cable very professional definitely
don't do this by any means I mean unless
you want to attach to a light fixture
studio light with a sandbag for sure to
weigh it down obviously you could do
this if you wanted to but just make sure
that the cat5 cable or whatever string
or cable that you're using you don't
mind getting a bunch of paint on or you
can mask it off I guess you could do it
that way too
also I'm using just some little bits of
wire to hang it routing it through the
little holes where the motherboard
screws go that seems to hang it up
pretty nice without interfering with the
object so on that no loose gentleman
cross your fingers for me say a prayer
and let's get spray painting
alright guys so this is the day after
that I spray-painted this thing it's not
completely dry it's been a good 16 hours
but the can says wait 24 hours until
it's fully dry of course it says it's a
safe to handle and whatnot so I actually
put it back on to the saber-tooth x99 so
I can kind of get a feel for what it
looks like
and I'm actually really happy with the
results as you can see it came out
pretty smooth
Thermal Armor still retains a lot of
detail I'm not sure if you can tell from
the camera but you can still see the
texture on that this part of the plastic
piece as well as all the the text is
very legible as well so I'm really happy
I did probably do a few more coats than
I should have and I think that made the
the gray come out a little bit darker
than I would have liked the reason why I
did so many coats was just simply
because there were so many nooks and
crannies in the thermal armor that
weren't getting coated evenly so had I
only done like two or three coats you
would have definitely seen some patches
here where the color the original color
would be showing underneath and I didn't
really want that so at the sacrifice of
a cleaner look I I made the gray a
little bit darker but I think it's gonna
work out alright I actually put some of
the mayhem pastel perfect pink liquid in
this little vial here so you can kind of
get a better idea of what it looks like
especially next to the next to the other
colors so this is kind of going to be
the color scheme guys it's gonna be
liquid go in all through all the tubes
with black and grey as far as like the
beige color on the sabre-tooth x99 I was
a bit concerned about that at first but
I'm not so much anymore because I
realized that most of this is going to
be covered up once all the components
are installed anyway but overall pretty
happy with it if i zoom out a little bit
here you can kind of get an idea i've
started installing the radiators just
for for placement and just trying to see
where my runs are going to be i'm you
can see I've got a 360 up here and I've
got a 240 at the front I think I'm only
gonna be doing push for both of these I
couldn't really get away with push pull
up top here because the the RAM is going
to be designed enough Ram clearance
therefore push pull here and I probably
could do push pull here because as you
can see I have the front panel of the
define us taken off the amount two fans
here and I could mount
two fans here but it's just gonna make
routing the the tubing from this port to
the reservoir a bit more difficult or
it's gonna look you know messy or untidy
so just you know I'm a beginner here I'm
a total noob guys when it comes to
custom water cooling so I'm just gonna
keep things simple and from there I can
maybe upgrade later on down the road if
I if I am so inclined but yeah there's
the pump reservoir combo pumps at the
bottom we've got the nice 204 millimeter
I believe is the length of that tube
which I think fills up the case pretty
nicely so yeah this is pretty cool stuff
I also have my um water block here I can
just put that there don't worry I have
the socket cover on I know I probably
almost gave someone a heart attack there
but that's what its gonna kind of look
like obviously it's gonna really come
together once everything's all installed
but I think that's pretty much gonna do
it for now guys let me know what you
guys think of this paint job like I said
it's my first time so go go easy on me
but personally speaking I'm pretty happy
with how it turned out so thank y'all
for watching hope you guys enjoyed it
please subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already be making more videos
especially about this water cooling
video coming really soon water boiling
build coming really soon
and I'll catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
