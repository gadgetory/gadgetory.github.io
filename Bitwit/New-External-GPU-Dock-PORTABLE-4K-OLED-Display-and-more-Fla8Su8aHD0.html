to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info alright
y'all so let's talk a little bit about
Asus and some of the cool things that
they were showing off at their hotel
suite this week starting with oddly
enough a router that's actually pretty
cool
it's the blue cave AAC 2600 dual band
wireless router for smart homes but of
course it can be used for much more than
that
well we'll touch on that in just a bit
it features intel Wi-Fi technology built
right in with 802 dot 11ac Wi-Fi and
speeds up to 2600 megabits per second as
the name suggests it's also fully
integrated with Amazon Alexa and echo so
you can pretty much boss your router
around and tell it what to do set up a
guest Network and it'll do so for
temporary three hours or something like
that whatever you specify or you can
tell it to pause the internet
temporarily while you do a lengthy
benchmarking session or something like
that so that's actually really cool I
might get one for the office it also
controls all of your smart home devices
from the desktop GUI or even remotely
from the supported app there's also an
option to create family member accounts
you know with parental controls you can
limit access things like that you can
schedule backups to the cloud with a
iCloud which is of course a Seuss's
service and there's also a device
intrusion technology built right in so
if you were to try to connect a infected
laptop or any infected device to your
network for example it would
automatically block it before any real
damage could actually take place you get
four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back
and according to the asus reps this
thing is supposed to have really really
good 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi
performance and this is of course thanks
to you a couple actually I think for
antennas that are actually built in
their internal antennas that sort of go
around that middle blue part they kind
of like wrap around it if you will and
so they're positioned in such a way that
they they give you the best possible
signal in pretty much every direction on
top of all that it's super compact so it
can pretty much fit anywhere in your
house not to mention I like the way it
looks it's it's not it's like hideous
like some other routers out there and
this is launching in just a few days
January 18th for a hundred and
seventy-nine US it's a little bit steep
for my tastes but at the same time
you're getting a lot of functionality
built in here so let me know what you
guys think about
that in the comments below next up we've
got the XG station Pro which is an
external GPU dock that's more or less
aimed at the pro and workstation crowd
but that doesn't mean you can't use it
for gaming and we'll talk about that in
just a moment
asus has sort of designed this to work
fluidly with something like one of their
Zen books for example for anyone who's
doing like 3d modeling if you're a CAD
artist or something like that this is a
really nice solution they've actually
co-developed the case design within
Wynne and it totally makes sense the
matches the soul the sort of a design
language that anyone usually goes with
aluminum construction it's very nice and
in person it looks beautiful it's
professional-looking very sleek and
modern I actually like the way it looks
a lot more than their gaming --xg docks
to be honest those are just a little bit
too aggressive for me and this one just
looks really nice on your desk
Thunderbolt 3 is the connectivity of
choice here and they have included a
cable thank goodness this is also
supporting not just pcs but Mac's as
well if you're into that sort of thing a
lot of graphic designers and you know
CAD experts and stuff who are using
Mac's so that makes sense
it can also house pretty much the latest
AMD and NVIDIA cards up to two and a
half slots wide so that's fantastic
lengthwise too it can actually fit an
ROG Strix GTX 1080i in there which is
awesome now this unit has a fairly small
footprint compared to most other GPU
Doc's that I've seen however there was a
bit of a sacrifice they actually had to
take the power supply and make it
external which is gonna bother some
people and others won't mind I I like
the decision I think it makes sense it
just looks nice and like nice and
compact and probably easier to carry
with you than just a larger enclosure
overall the power supply is 330 watts so
that's enough to drive some fairly
high-end graphics cards bear in mind the
PSU only has to drive the the actual
card and not things like a CPU or your
motherboard etc so that is nice on the
right side of the dock you'll find two
fairly large fans that are there resting
right up against the the GPU back plate
to help exhaust hot air when under load
and then we've also got dust filters
plenty of ventilation on multiple sides
and this is gonna retail for 329 us
which is actually a lot cheaper than
their gaming oriented GPU docks but it
is still a little bit pricey all things
considered still very very beautiful and
well thought-out design
finally we've got the PQ tutu you see
pro art 4k HDR OLED portable display
that is a mouthful but this item is one
of the one of the ones that piqued my
interest most at the AC suite like the
last item that we just talked about this
is also aimed at workstation
professionals who are on the go
primarily so there's a twenty one point
six inch 4k matte display very glad they
opted for matte here at 60 Hertz with a
point one millisecond response time this
thing is lightning quick so is it meant
for gaming no could you game on it
comfortably most definitely I would say
so obviously they didn't have any gaming
demos set up on this panel because it's
not how it's being marketed but I would
love to get my hands on one of these and
just test it out myself
we also get high color saturation with
100% DCI p3 coverage and HDR 10 support
so not only is this gonna be really
great for media playback and such but
also editing color grading graphic
design pretty much anything that has to
do with color you're gonna be sure to
get some really accurate rich vibrant
colors that are just very well produced
here on the side of the display we find
USB type-c and micro HDMI I believe the
protocols or I would assume that the
protocol is being used here are gonna be
DisplayPort 1.2 for the types II and
probably HDMI 2.0 B for the micro so but
don't quote me on that that's just a
guess this is a really cool lot of a lot
of cutting edge technology that's
crammed into this really portable design
this is sort of portable frame it's only
eight point four millimeters thick or
thin I should say it's super thin you
can pretty much take it anywhere you go
and fairly light it's just 2.6 pounds
that's incredibly light for a display
included is a carrying case that also
functions as a stand and if that's not
good enough they are selling an optional
hard foldable stand with tilt adjustment
so if you want a little bit more
flexibility there and just elevate or
maybe you just want to elevate the the
display off of your desk a little bit
that's a great solution don't know what
the pricing or availability is on this
thing but I would like to get my hands
on this and like I said try some gaming
with it but I would imagine that with
all the technology and the sort of form
factor that we're dealing with here that
this thing is probably not going to be
super cheap but that's pretty much all I
got for you guys right now for from from
Asus for CES 2018 guys let me know if
anything tickled you
fancy in the comments below and feel
free to toss me a like on the video if
you enjoyed it you can also get
subscribed for more tech coverage at CES
2018 right here on dead guys thanks for
watching I will see you all in the next
