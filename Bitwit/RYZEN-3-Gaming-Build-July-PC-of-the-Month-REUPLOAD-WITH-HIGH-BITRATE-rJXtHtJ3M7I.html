think it can be a game-changer like at
50 bucks Kyle okay isn't Indy rising
just the best Kyle focus oh yeah hold on
let me fix that here we go
damn it over here sexy Kyle focus got it
the focus G from fractal design is a new
budget case done right click the link in
the description for more info what's
going on guys welcome back to the
channel today is very exciting because
we are continuing our pc of the month
series which i have not been following
through with for the last couple of
months and i apologize for that but
finally it's back hopefully that's okay
even though it is towards the end of the
month this is going to be July's pc of
the month just in time but it's going to
be a budget system i'm going with a
budget of 650 dollars today because i
think with the latest offerings from AMD
we can make that happen and still pack
in quite a bit of horsepower so let's
take a look at the parts that we're
rocking here first and foremost with
this processor around here this is the
horizon 3 1300 x this is the higher of
the two skews that are going to be
released very soon so this is still
under embargo actually so i can't reveal
all the juicy details and they won't be
able to show you guys any performance
numbers until part two of this video
which is generally how to defend my pc
how pc of the month goes anyway but this
is a 1300 x it's a fork or not eight
thread chip because it does not feature
SMT or simultaneous multi-threading like
Rison 5 and Rison 7 does that being said
with 4 physical cores we're actually
doubling our core count over something
like an intel core i3
that exists in the same price range now
i say that lightly because i don't
really know what the official price is
for this particular CPU
AMD has not given us that information
yet but based on the horizon 5 1400
which is their lowest end skew in the
risin 5 class which is going for 165 ish
dollars us right now I would imagine
that the 1,300 X is probably going to go
for around 140 dollars
ballpark so that's the price that I'm
using to factor in the CPU into the bill
next up we've got our motherboard here
through the Asus Prime be 350 plus a
fantastic board that we've actually used
before in the spec alpha build me to the
month or two ago it's a great value in
my opinion for under a hundred bucks and
it has plenty of connectivity more than
enough for a budget gaming system
including for gem slots got USB 3 m2 of
course so really solid aim for offering
there from Asus we're gonna be pairing
that with this memory kit from g.skill
this is a Ripjaws 5 very popular with
horizon builds because it just works
assuming that you've got to you know
your proper BIOS updates and whatnot but
this is a 8 gigabyte kit now I know you
guys are going to scream at me for
buying a 2 by 4 gigabyte kit however I
decided to go with a dual channel kit
instead of just one 8 gig stick for a
couple reasons first off we have four
dimm slots on this motherboard so
there's nothing stopping us from popping
in another 8 gigs and that would give us
16 of course that would cap us we
wouldn't be able to add any more without
fully removing the kit entirely but I've
actually seen some test results and what
not testing single Channel versus dual
channel with Rison and not only does not
only does frequency of your RAM affect
performance when you're talking about
AMD Rison but apparently dual channel
can also improve your performance quite
a bit so I'm actually going to do
another video very soon
comparing single channel and dual
channel memory when it comes to rising
performance so stay tuned for that it
should be pretty interesting but yeah
that's pretty much why I've opted for a
dual channel kit of smaller capacity per
stick than one larger capacity stick and
again will validate all that in a future
video coming soon I also forgot to
mention that this kit is rated at twenty
eight hundred megahertz we're going to
have to get into the BIOS and see if we
can actually overclock this at all
potentially to 2933 or even beyond that
if possible to again take advantage of
that infinity fabric that comes along
with Rison
and and hopefully get some additional
frames out of our gameplay next up we've
got our power supply the vs 400 from
Corsair this is a budget unit of course
it I think we got it for $35 or
something like that the cables are not
pretty by any means they are ketchup and
mustard it's pretty gnarly we're not
going for aesthetics here but it's still
a pretty decent unit at least it's not
like got a hideous sticker on it or
something like that and it is 80 plus
certified so that's nice our graphics
card of choice is the EVGA gtx 1050 TI
or gigabyte model I think this card is
going to pair pretty nicely with a 1300
X and honestly if you go right now with
all the cryptocurrency mining craze
going on still if you go anywhere above
a GTX 1050 Ti let's say a GTX 1060 and
above or even if your dabbling in the rx
400-series from AMD you're going to see
a ridiculously inflated prices granted
they might have come down a little bit
because the the price of the value of
aetherium has dropped down for example
but still it's pretty inflated but as
soon as you get to 1050 pi and below
you're pretty much safe from from those
crazy inflated rapes so I wanted to just
be able to get a card that was going to
pair nicely with our CPU and also
something that we could get for a more
or less retail price so obviously we're
going for 1080p gaming that's what we're
striving for I've already done some
testing on the 1050 Ti in the past which
has shown really good results at 1080p
you can get away with you know high even
very high settings in some instances
depending on the game so this should be
pretty nice can't wait to test this
overall storage includes this a data SP
600 128 gig SSD this is gonna be for our
boot drive and maybe some basic
applications web browser and stuff like
that it's not it's not the biggest drive
again this is a $650 rig and I just
think at that price point you should be
able to fit an SSD in there even if it's
not the biggest or highest capacity 128
gigs should still be enough for Windows
10 and in all of our basic or basic
applications you can always upgrade that
later down the line that's another thing
I like about this system so far is that
it seems very upgradable if you want to
upgrade to 1300 X 2 say you know a 1700
or maybe even an 1800 X in the future
and you can very easily do so because
we're still rocking the am4 motherboard
here the same socket between all the
rise and chips so far
that's really nice obviously the
graphics card would be really easy to
swap out as well later down the line so
128 gig SSD we've also got a 2 terabytes
the hitachi drive I found this this
might have been a refurb so sorry if it
is but I think we got this for like $25
or something like that for 2 terabytes
which is pretty killer so that's
obviously where all of our games and
other big applications and files are
going to go and then finally our case
this is a I think sort of a new case
from thermaltake this is the core G 21
TG the T G stands for tempered glass
this is only a $70 case it's a full ATX
it supports a lot of water cooling
features like looks like you've got some
some reservoir supports in there 360
read at the front I believe even though
we don't have again going with this sort
of theme of expandability and being able
to upgrade in the future if you wanted
to you could add some liquid cooling
flair into the system no problem with
this particular case even though it's
still fairly budget oriented because
honestly the case is one of the most
difficult and pain in the ass things to
upgrade because obviously you got to
take everything out of your build and
start from scratch kind of so from the
looks of it you get tempered glass on
both sides on the other business end on
the back and on the front end it looks
like you've got a power supply shroud as
well which should help with cable
management and kind of a nice mesh front
so hopefully lots of healthy intake from
that end but those are all the parts
ladies and gentlemen is the priest of oh
you know what I completely forgot to
mention I'm sorry the CPU cool you guys
are probably wondering those of you who
aren't aware this the Rison 3 the 1300 X
actually includes the Wraith stealth
cooler which is very similar to this
Wraith cooler it's almost exactly the
same actually I think it's the same
exact fan the only difference being that
the the heatsink for the stealth over
there is actually you know about half
the height of this particular one which
came included with what the risin 5
series so there's no RGB on it either
but that's ok if you guys are at all
interested in any of this stuff
I've left links to everything in the
description below maybe except for
rising 3 because it's not out yet but
other than that let's go ahead and start
building will circle back and I'll let
you guys know how it went
oh god it's hideous just look at it look
at it I can't do it guys I can't see
what were you have an extension
all right here she is late and gentlemen
let's go ahead and boot her up for the
very first time assuming she works
ah-ha looking good okay great let's
let's talk about some things here first
off this card looks really tiny it looks
really small in this system actually
when I initially started planning the
parts for this build
I had a micro ATX case from Thermaltake
in mind and the reps there convinced me
to use the core g21 instead because it's
more current it's a newer case it's more
relevant I figured it'd be more relevant
for you guys to show you a new case so I
went with with this one instead which
happens to be ATX but I did not change
my choice of video card so that's why we
still have this tiny little guy here and
he looks really small in this cavernous
interior that I was not at first
anticipating so hopefully that's okay
you guys already saw me add in the
sleeved extension these are all from
cable mod I just threw these in for the
video sake because they look nice
ketchup and mustard sucks and and
besides the cables don't affect the
in-game performance of a system in any
way shape or form so I figured I'd just
throw them in because they they look
pretty cool
matches definitely with the the RAM and
the red accents on the motherboard for
sure then we've also got some things to
say about the case here coming back to
the g21 the core g21 Thermaltake is
under the impression that if you buy
this chassis you're probably going to
buy an AI o along with it because it
supports hell of water cooling at the
front up to a 360 I believe and because
of that they don't include any front
intake fans the only fan that comes
included with the case is this rear 120
so bear that in mind if you're buying
this chassis and you're not planning to
water cool then you might want to load
up on some additional case pans 120 or
140 s are supported here at the front
especially if you're going to be
installing hotter running components in
here we've got some pretty cool
components here the 1300 X isn't going
to get very hot the 1050 Ti is not going
to get very hot either so I'm not too
concerned at this point but if I was
running anything faster
like a you know maybe a 1070 or
something like that I'd probably want to
install at least one or two case pans at
the front so bear that in mind
cable routing in the G 21 was also
pretty pretty smooth obviously you're
not getting any sort of like cable
routing grommets which would have been
super nice but for 70 bucks you can't
really expect it to much instead you get
this sort of cable wall plus you've got
this really nice basement to store all
of your excess cables which really helps
tidy up the backside of the case behind
the motherboard tray and there's a
healthy number of tie-down points as
well to make that all happen you'll
notice that the basement is sort of open
right here that's just because if you
wanted to install like a reservoir or
pump I would imagine or maybe even a 120
fin I don't really have much else to say
about the build for now other than I'm
super excited to test out Rison 3 the
1300 X here should be getting tested
really soon actually part two of this
video hopefully it'll line up for with
the with the launch with the rise and
three launch note no promises on that
but it's coming soon it's coming very
soon so stay tuned for that and let me
know what you think of the think of the
build so far I'm digging it diggin it
ain't the most like high-end case I
think the front is probably the part I
like the least
aesthetically but with the tempered
glass on both sides it definitely looks
a lot more premium than the price you
pay for it so let me know what you think
of the case as well guys that's going to
do it for now be sure to toss me a like
