hot
Fred look this other everywhere oh my
gosh navigations River erosion ladies we
don't all the way across the country
like to tour hey hey hey honey well at
least this thing is silent stop talking
get out introducing the node 202 from
fractal design it's cool compact and
quiet check the description below for
more details
what's up guys welcome back to the
channel today I am gonna give you guys a
tour of my new and improved land set up
that I'm gonna be bringing with me to
PDX land this weekend in Portland Oregon
it's my second ever land on this scale
it's like a 500-person land I think
correct me if I'm wrong but it's huge
it's supposed to be one of the biggest
ones in the country PDX is known for
throwing these huge ass land parties and
it's my second one ever the first one I
ever did was a few months ago actually
in Seattle that was Lansing to get
hosted by the folks over at tech
syndicate
I guess formerly Tek syndicate now their
crit TV I believe I don't know still a
better name than bit wid now not to brag
or anything but for my first land party
ever I was actually really happy with
the amount of hardware that I brought I
mean I got a fully fledged desktop
gaming PC I had a mechanical keyboard
the works pretty much and as satisfied
as I was and still am with that setup
there were a few little tiny things that
I wanted to change or improve to it so
that's basically what I'm gonna be
sharing with you today starting with a
look at my my old setup my current setup
that I had at land syndicate and then
from there we can work our way forward
and check out some of the new things
that I've added since then for PDX land
alright so here is version 1.0 the OG of
the land party and a bag so this is
where it all started folks and I'm not
going to
spend too much time on this because I've
already done a video on it but just
really quick running down the basics
here we've got a G chic monitor honestly
the model number escapes me at the
moment but I put links to all this stuff
in the description below so you can go
ahead and check those out if you're
interested in picking up any of these
products so G chic monitor it's an IPS
15.6 inch display it's actually been a
treat to game on however just the size
is not exactly where I wanted to be for
long periods of gaming if I'm going to
be gaming for an entire weekend at a LAN
party I would like a little bit more
screen real estate especially if I'm
going to be doing like some streaming as
well having extra screen real estate for
that sort of thing for twitch and xsplit
would be very handy so this is going to
be one room of improvement for our LAN
setup also here's the bar mil OVA 87 and
mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX brown
switches it's also been a really good
little keyboard this is actually a wifey
sauces daily driver and I do love gaming
on at Cherry MX browns are currently and
still my favorite switch of all time
however this is also going to be swapped
out because I wanted something a little
bit slimmer as thin as the bezel of this
thing already is
you know we've got those 60% or 68%
keyboards now with mechanical switches
that I just wanted to give a shot I've
never tried them before so that's going
to be replacing this keyboard pretty
soon and then we've got the the Logitech
g600 wireless gaming mouse this is
honestly just one of my favorite
wireless mice ever just because it's
super precise there's literally zero
input lag that I can notice the only
problem though is within a big event
like P DX I'm a little bit concerned
that having a wireless mouse is just a
little too easy for someone to walk by
this my setup unattended and just slide
this into their pockets so I'm going to
be replacing that mouse with a wired one
of course you can only improve things in
terms of performance with a wired
connection so that's also on the plus
side there but I'm going to be retiring
this for land land party in a bag 1.0 I
work where as I forget which headphone
which headset I was using I think I was
using the old-school Corsair hs1 A's
which have been out for like five six
years now and those were really nice but
I'm going to go wireless this time with
with with these these are the Sennheiser
Sennheiser SteelSeries 8
Wireless and there's some of the nicer
kind of more high-end wireless gaming
headsets out there it's got a
retractable mic somewhere in there it's
also got this wireless box it uses its
own radio frequency to connect and it's
it sounds really good and I really love
the hot swappable battery feature you
can basically just that's the wrong side
but you there's a hot swappable battery
somewhere in here
I didn't plan this video out very well
anytime your battery dies you pop off
the side you take that battery out and
there's a fresh one that stays charged
inside of the unit itself you can just
pop that in start charging the old
battery and while continue on gaming
uninterrupted it's a really really nice
solution for battery swapping which
means you literally have zero zero
downtime and then finally we can move on
to the PC itself the note 202 from
fractal design still remains one of my
favorite mini ITX cases just because
it's so portable it's about 10 liters in
in capacity but it fits a lot of awesome
hardware in there up pun intended whoa
but I'm not actually going to be
changing this desktop at all I'm still
going to be bringing it still still
using it for PDX this weekend however I
have made one change that was very
critical to the health of the PC itself
and that was the a i/o liquid cooler
that I had stuck in here which was
initially a Corsair H 55 oh look that
looks like a Corsair age 55 because it
is this is actually the cooler that was
initially inside of the do go anywhere
do anything PC the reason why I took it
out is because I was noticing
temperatures skyrocket to over a hundred
degrees on all cores forcing the PC to
shutdown and freak me out so I was like
what the hell what's what's going on
here so I opened it up cracked it open
took a look and noticed that the wire
the pump wire is complete was completely
fried now I don't know if this is a
Coursera thing or maybe something got
really hot on the motherboard and was
just touching the the cable too closely
but it basically cut right through part
of the wire and so basically what I was
dealing with was a broken pump it was a
dead pump there was no water being
circulated through the loop
and that's what was causing the
temperatures to skyrocket and ultimately
crash the system so I installed a new
one I installed a different one it's the
cooler master sided cooler master side
in 120 that's what it's called so I
installed the side in granted it's
actually got a slightly thicker radiator
than the aged 55 and it was just they
barely fit inside of the note 202 just
barely bear in mind this case is not
even officially supported with a iOS so
I mean I really had to cram that sucker
in there but once it finally fit it was
working out for a while
mind you I was actually using it with
this fan 120 millimeter fractal design
venturi static pressure fan sorry for
the bad focus but the fact that this
system is running right now without that
fan installed on the side and probably
queues you in to believe that something
went awry and yes it did for the first
half an hour or so it was fine
temperatures were all normal in the 6700
K which is overclock mind G 240 400
megahertz but after after that maybe
after 45 minutes to an hour I started
noticing the temperatures on the CPU
getting as hot almost as hot as when we
were using the H 55 so I was like what
the hell is going on what's with why why
can't why can't we cool this CPU down
why is it getting so hot so let me go
ahead and pop off the the panel here
take a look inside and I will show you
exactly what was going on and what I did
to fix it so here's a look at the
innards and really quick for those of
you who are unfamiliar with the system
so rude of me for not telling you what
GPU is in here it's an r9 nano from AMD
but more on that later we're going to
talk about our non nanos in just a bit
but moving on to the topic at hand which
is the overheating issue for our
overclocked 6700 K over there now if you
guys are familiar with this fan that you
can see I've installed on the radiator
then you probably already have an idea
as to what was causing that overheating
problem which was with a standard 25
millimeter thick fan like the fractal
venturi or any other fan with the same
dimensions and a slightly thicker 120
millimeter radiator like the one on the
side on here with both of those
installed in the no 202 and a side panel
closed or the main panel closed
there's hardly
any breathing room between the fan and
the case the side of the case itself
which meant whether the fan is in push
or pull configuration it's not getting
any kind of airflow it's either not
exhausting air the way it should be or
it's not able to intake air the way it
should be so as a result I swapped out
the venturi for this 15 millimeter thick
side slipstream slim fan it's a slim fan
I've had this fan for like ages you can
see I actually had to chop off some of
the the the mounting holes here so I
could get the screws in there because I
didn't have any radiator screws that
that would fit the 15 millimeter thick
fans here so I had to actually cut that
cut that part out but anyway that
improvement has drastically increased
our thermal dissipation and improved
thermals quite a bit so I'm really happy
about that because otherwise I don't
know what I would have done had this
slipstream solution not worked I
probably would have had to go back to
using an air cooler that low profile
knock to it that was initially in here
which granted isn't bad for what it is
but nowhere near the performance as a
120 millimeter a i/o so on that note
let's go ahead and fire this guy up
again and we'll actually take a look at
the thermals we're getting with this new
solution alright so we've got the system
vitals all queued up oh by the way I
also installed an LED strip yeah
couldn't resist looks pretty cool though
right
so since I'm using one of the z170a mini
ITX boards from MSI I'm also using their
software here super handy the MSI
Command Center used that to overclock
our 6700 K 240 400 megahertz on all
course that's running all nice and good
and taking a look at our temperatures
here again you did in heaven 4.0 that
we're running in the background we've
been running this for about 15-20
minutes now so thermals are subject to
increase a little bit more if we are to
run this test even further but others
should give us a good starting off
indication on what kind of thermals we
can expect so far so on our hottest core
we're getting 65 degrees Celsius think
about that guys 65 degrees Celsius core
i7 overclocked to 4400 in a node 202
like
come on I probably have one of the
coolest CPUs that's overclocked
in in this particular case I I'm pretty
proud of that so that's a really really
favorable number I think we could
probably get it lower if we were to
increase the fan speed by the way
actually we can't I take that back
the scythe slipstream is that a hundred
percent fan speed it's just it's maxed
out and honestly it's not even that loud
you can't really tell right now because
my AC is on but that's an indication you
can't even hear it over my AC much maybe
you can go onto this side I'm wearing a
lavalier so that's not really going to
do much but it is fairly quiet
especially if you're going to be
bringing this thing to a land where
there's going to be chaos and commotion
and ambient noise through the roof and
plus you're going to be wearing
headphones and stuff so you're really
not going to hear the acoustics at all
and even when you're not even in a quiet
room that that slipstream fan at 100 is
not too bad so that's that's pretty much
as cool as it's going to get I guess on
our 6700 K but I'm happy with those
temperatures now as far as the our 9
nano is concerned I've got MSI
Afterburner on here and you can see the
only thing I've adjusted in the settings
is the power limit crank crank that all
the way to 50 because if you don't
well the r9 Nano is a very power
constrained card and without cranking
the power limits um you are going to run
into some thermal throttling issues
which if you can see here we're not
we're not getting any of that GPU core
clocks at a steady 10,000 I'm sorry
tenta whoa that's that's impressive
1045 megahertz not dipping it's not
going to a thousandth not going to 980
it's staying straight at 1045 megahertz
which means we are not thermal
throttling which is something to be
happy about I guess and the reason why
I'm not cranking up anything else in
terms of the the GPU core clock or
memory clock is simply because I'm going
to be gaming at 1920 by 1080 at the land
which is I mean the r9 nano is
completely going to crush that
resolution with pretty much any game I
throw at it max settings more or less
across the board sure there's always
exceptions and stuff but for the most
part I'm not too worried about trying to
squeeze every last ounce of performance
out of the card at this resolution
especially if it's going to mean
introducing more heat into our case
louder thermals I'm sorry aloud our
thermals louder acoustics and things of
that nature so I'm pretty happy with how
it is right now I'm going to
some gaming later on do some testing and
if everything checks out I'm probably
just going to leave it as is is that if
I see that there's some room for
improvement or if I'm not happy with the
frame rates I'm getting which I really
doubt that's going to be the case then
perhaps I'll put a moderate overclock on
there although I will have to switch
from afterburner to Trix because
currently Trix I believe is the only
overclocking utility that supports HBM
overclocking so I would have to do that
but um an upset about the hardware
everything is running super smoothly oh
I didn't tell you the temperatures here
temperature is on you probably already
saw this though what the freaking hell
was that Unigine crashed oh no you
didn't crash display driver stopped
working Oh God
what the Hooten who nanny's wrong with
this thing I don't understand
we weren't even overclocked I mean other
than having the power limit cranked to
the max I mean since it crashed I
actually took off 5 megahertz on the GPU
core clock just to be sure just to be
safe but that's weird
there's only 76 degrees 76
that's super reasonable for the r9 nano
I don't know why a crash it could have
been just an anomaly but I'll keep a
close eye on it but the show must go on
if it happens to crash again I will
address it by the end of the video if it
doesn't happen to crash again I'll also
point that out but moving on the show
must go on people so now that we've
taken a look at kind of the system and
how it performs which is overall good
apart from that stupid crash what do we
go ahead and take a look at some of the
hardware that I'll be replacing this
stuff with for PDX this weekend so
starting with the monitor look at this
look at this this is a bad boy we're
moving on from a portable monitor to a
full-fledged desktop panel this is a TN
panel however it is very high refresh
rate 144 Hertz and 1 millisecond
response time according to the
manufacturer of course it's an AOC g2 4
6 0 PF links to all this stuff
in the description below guys in case
you're curious want to find out more or
maybe purchase one for yourself so this
is a free sync panel it's got free sync
phrasing panel guess how much I paid for
it $200 $200 for a free sync 144 Hertz
for a refresh rate panel which is pretty
damn cool 24 inches so I'm used to
gaming on 27 inches at home except for
the predator that's that's a little bit
larger than
seven inches but up until this point
it's usually been 27 inches for me for
land obviously I'm going to scale down a
bit so 24 inches coming from the fifteen
point six inches on that guy holy moly
there's going to be a huge improvement
when gaming away from home so I'm really
excited to use this if you believe it's
got both HDMI and DisplayPort outputs or
inputs I should say so SuperDuper
exciting also I'm going to be replacing
the keyboard as I mentioned with this
magic force mechanical keyboard it's a
68 key so 68 percent IRR it's a much
smaller than than the VAR mill OVA 87 M
there which is kind of why I bought it
it's just so cute it's just so adorable
I did not get it in white it comes in
white but I opted for black because I
will destroy white keys in a heartbeat
if I have them so I got the black
version it's got white backlit LEDs
we're going to go ahead and plug that in
a bit and show you it all lit up and
stuff it's very sexy keyboard it does
come with the variety of switches you
can get it in either you know black blue
brown and it also comes in different
brands of switches too you can get
cherry MX Gator on I believe kale I went
with the Gator on cherry imitator on
sure what the Gator on Browns which feel
freaking fantastic they feel right on
par with cherry MX actually just a very
very slight difference I can barely
hardly tell or distinguish the two but
we're going to go ahead and check that
out in a bit as well going to actually
haul this monitor across and finally
you're probably wondering how the hell
am I going to actually haul this monitor
to the land in Portland I live in
California so yes I'm going to be taking
a plane there well let me tell you I got
this thing this is the row cat tusko or
tusko whatever the hell it is it's a
carrying bag for an LCD monitor supports
monitors from anywhere from 20 to 24
inches wide screen panels what do you
know it looks really cool what's very
tactical it's got a nice very nice
rubber handle carrying handle and stuff
and I'm hoping that it fits this this
AOC modder like a glove now in case you
guys are wondering how exactly I'm going
to haul this monitor from California to
Portland for PDX this weekend I did pick
up this rocket 2 skull I don't know if
I'm pronouncing that right at all
rocket to scho LCV carrying bag
it's pretty cool actually it looks very
tactical it's got a carrying handle it
supports monitors from 20 to 24 inches
in in diameter
no.not diameter in in diagonal diagonal
dimension there's definitely a word for
that that I can't think of right now but
anyway it's a pretty cool bag the only
thing I'm concerned about is whether or
not I'm gonna be able to actually carry
it onto the plane as a carry-on I did
look up reviews on Amazon and other
places online and most everyone there
everyone online is saying that they've
been able to take it with them on a
plane but time will tell I hope that I
can bring it on as a carry-on otherwise
I'm leaving it behind in my car in the
parking lot of LAX because I am not
letting someone check this and handle it
themselves they will totally destroy it
but it's a pretty cool bag it's got some
really sturdy or what appears to be
sturdy latches here you can even a put
your your keyboard inside like that I
don't know if I will because that
exposes your keyboard and also since I'm
using a mini keyboard it might not even
fit quite well but it's also got padding
on the inside so it protects your screen
the screen side I believe there's only
padding on that one side though but
that's the important side so I'm very
very excited to try this out see how it
works out and I'll report back to you
guys and let you know how it goes so on
that note I'm going to go ahead and set
all this stuff up on the desk to give us
a final look at all the hardware that
I'm going to bring in with me to this
weekend's land all right here is setup
2.0 of land party in a bag although I
guess now that I have a full desktop
monitor it's it's more like land party
in two bags there's one for the monitor
and one for the desktop anyway looking
pretty good so far
kind of digging how the the red accent
on the chin bar there is matching with
the red LEDs I just put in the no - OH -
fancy also on the gaming mouse this is
my Logitech gt500 as many of you know
it's my daily driver this is what I will
be bringing with me - PDX
because it's oh so comfy and I love it
so much the only thing kind of killing
the the overall theme here is the yellow
on the mod met good lord
my setup suffers from ketchup and
mustard syndrome but apart from that I'm
digging it so far
the SteelSeries H Wireless looks
absolutely perfect resting on the end
- OH - there and in case you guys are
curious about this monitor again its 144
Hertz TN one millisecond and for $200 or
210 dollars that I paid for it you
actually do get quite a bit for your
money it is a matte screen and fairly
thin - of course it protrudes a little
bit more from the back you do get a vase
amount the stand itself is really
high-quality actually everything about
this monitor is much higher quality than
you would expect for the price point it
does feature like Full Tilt swivel and
panning adjustment on the right side of
the panel you get two USB 2.0
pass-through ports the orange one on top
actually supports fast charging so
that's really cool if you're in need of
charging a mobile device like a
smartphone or tablet there's also two
more of these ports on the underside of
the panel so you get four word total
those ones do not support fast charging
though as far as video inputs you get
dual link DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
however however only the DisplayPort
input is going to support free sync I
already tried hooking up the HDMI does
not work which tells me that it's
probably older than HDMI 2.0 it's
probably 1.4 or older but that's still
pretty cool I mean whatever just use
DisplayPort who cares overall I'm
digging this set up so far however I
haven't even had a chance to game on
this monitor yet so why don't we go
ahead and fire up some games I'll play
for anywhere from half an hour to 45
minutes and then we'll take a look at
our thermals to give us a better idea of
what kind of temperatures we can expect
under a working load in this exact
scenario
all right so that gives you guys an idea
on the kind of performance we can expect
with this system and I'm sorry that I
didn't use the most intensive games for
that test I don't actually have all that
all the games that I want to play at PDX
loaded up on this PC I have to do that
tonight before I board the plane
tomorrow but from what we can tell
everything is looking really good I mean
GTA 5 max that out with the exception of
msaa which still ran at 2x no problem
was able to hit you know 50 to 650 to 70
FPS on average which is pretty solid in
my opinion I really did like the way
everything functioned like the setup
works really great for a little portable
station I think it does really well the
only thing that I will say is that this
keyboards defective my op Wow
I'm serious the WASD Keys are not
working like they should in game works
perfectly fine for typing when I jumped
into GTA 5 the a and the D we're not
functioning as they should
it was actually kind of reversed
sometimes or sometimes just wouldn't
work at all so I might have to automate
this keyboard guys I know that's
probably a very rare sight and doesn't
paint a good picture for this magic
force board here but I'm hoping that it
is just once in a once in a blue moon
occurrence for their QA process apart
from that everything else works
flawlessly the monitor is great too game
on the color is actually not even bad
for a team panel of course I did have to
mess around with some of the settings in
the OSD but once I took care of that it
looks fantastic
the free sync is a-okay it just looks
absolutely great so again quite a deal
for 200 bucks I'm very excited with the
performance so far and I think that's oh
let's talk about temps I told you guys I
was going to show you the temperatures
so let me crank the settings or the the
brightness down here so you can see so
core i7 6700 K overclocked at 4400
megahertz
I played for over an hour guys over an
hour and we didn't top 75 degrees
Celsius on the hottest core which is
just it's just fabulous guys and then
for the r9 nano again not overclocked
although the power limit was increased
maxed out pretty much we got 79 degrees
Celsius which
I'm I'm happy with I'm totally happy if
I can put an AMD card in here in it stay
below 80 especially in the Mini ITX case
I am a happy happy camper so all things
considered I would call this little
setup here a huge success I cannot wait
to game on it come tomorrow or I guess
later this weekend and it should be fun
on a final note I'm going to go ahead
and pack this stuff up in particular I'm
going to actually put the monitor inside
of the rocket carrying bag to give you
guys an idea of what that looks like all
situated and then we'll close this video
out and he or she is all suited up
there's the monitor in the case and to
be honest with you it fits like a glove
it fits really well it looks really nice
and you definitely get a sense of
security with the the padding here on
the front it's not super thick which
keeps a slim profile however it does
feel adequate to protect your your panel
your screen from any kind of accidental
horrors so to speak one thing I will say
though is if you are going to buy a
monitor for this bag to get a panel that
has a stand that's easily removable or a
stand that can fold up flat that way you
don't have to actually remove the stand
and replace it if you're going to be
traveling with it as a carry-on because
as a carry-on I don't think that this is
regulation here I think I'm gonna have
to remove the stand pack that up
separately in a different bag and then
just bring the monitor itself in in the
in the carrying tote but apart from that
very nice it even has some some stash
some stash room here got a zipper pocket
for like your power cables HDMI video
cables whatever DisplayPort and yeah
little pockets down here as well OOP
these two straps here are where your
keyboard would go if you were to carry
that along as well however you are going
to need a lengthier keyboard in order
for that to work for example the
defective magic force here it's not
quite long enough so 10 keyless boards
probably not long enough to take
advantage of that but all the other ones
should be fine
alright y'all so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this little setup tour of my new
land station here I really do enjoy
putting these setups together just
