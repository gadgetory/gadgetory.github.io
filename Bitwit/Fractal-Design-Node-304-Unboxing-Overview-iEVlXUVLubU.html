unboxing and overview of this note 304
Mini ITX computer chassis from fractal
design now is it the right case for you
I won't think one person knows for sure
I'm talking about myself
all right so taking a look at the front
of the case you you can see that fractal
is kind of sticking with the
minimalistic design of their chassis
which I personally am a huge fan of you
can see also they have their fractal
logo right there it's pretty small but I
like that it's not too obtrusive but you
can still see the fractal branding
there's actually an LED power light an
LED indicator right there which will
power on when your system is on on the
side here we have a power button of
course and two USB 3.0 ports and
headphone microphone jack right there
this cutout right here this ventilation
is actually for your power supply
exhausts so unlike most cases when the
power supply is mounted in the back here
chassis this one's actually mounted
towards the front and as you can see on
the bottom here there's your intake
ventilation for your power supply
they've been so kind to include a
removable dust filter so you can go
ahead and remove that and spray it down
with some compressed air when it gets
nasty enough and you've got four rubber
feet to prevent this guy from sliding
around on your desk or scratching up
whatever surface it is on and take a
look at the back so on the back here you
have a 140 millimeter fans set to
exhaust and it also has mounting points
for a hundred and twenty millimeter fans
so you can actually mount 120 millimeter
radiator if you want to do some liquid
cooling in this bad boys um and also
you've got some expansion slots right
here so you can see that you can
actually fit a dual slot card to slot
cards so you can actually have some
pretty good gaming performance with this
little with this little guy
and there's cutout for your eye oh
she'll for your motherboard and there's
your power supply port so even though
the power supply is mounted in the front
of your case there's actually a little
pass-through that goes down and connects
right over here so you don't have to
have a stupid cable sticking out the
side of your case from your power supply
on the side here we've got a lot of
ventilation this is a very nice and open
and this is practically where your video
cards are going to sit because you can
see from the expansion slots right there
so you're actually gonna have a lot of
fresh air coming in from this side of
the chassis because it's just so nice
and open you've got the top here with
some basically just a sleek aluminum as
we saw the rest of the body and some
aluminum mesh grille right here so
there's actually an intake fan - and
take fans ninety-two millimeter Hydra
bearing
fans are here which I'm going to pop the
front bezel off show you guys there they
are the two fans and you should here's
your front I owe you can actually
disconnect these cables right here if
you want to remove this bezel completely
that will give you some more room if you
want to maybe swap out the fans or you
just need to get to the dust filter
that's right here which pops out just
like so can dust that off but wait I
totally forgot to mention that there is
actually a fan controller at the back of
this chassis I totally overlooked it
because it's just so darn tiny but there
you have it there's low medium and high
so you've got three different voltage
settings for your fans and just gonna
pop this outer shell off so we can take
a look at the inside so I don't know if
I already mentioned it but there are
four thumb screws that's all you really
need to unscrew in order to pop this guy
off if you're wondering what this fifth
um screw is right there that's basically
just to hold your expansion slot
brackets in place alright so the four
screws are gone and Wow graceful very
graceful Kyle so here is the outer body
the majority of it three sides there's a
ventilation on both sides that I talked
about but it's all aluminum as I
mentioned it's very sturdy let's take a
look at the rest of the chassis alright
so the first thing you guys would
probably notice about this chassis is
that freckle has once again gone with a
black and white color scheme with the
fans as well as the drive cages right
here or maybe that's the first thing you
noticed where the drive cages because
they're kind of in a in a unique
position right here right they're kind
of suspended up above so in total you
can have up to six drives whether those
be three and a half inch or two and a
half inch drives because each of these
cages can hold two so two four six and
simply you just kind of unscrew two of
these thumb screws and one Phillips head
screw to remove one of the drive cages
which I'm gonna do right now by the way
if you can tell there are fractal design
logos on each of these drive cages so
it's kind of like one of the first
things you see looks kind of cool but it
slides out just like that when you have
the screws removed so there's the logo
and here you can see that they've
included some rubber grommets on both
sides for reducing noise and vibration
for your mechanical drives since those
are the ones
moving parts and you know what while I'm
here I might as well just remove the
other two cages so you can get a much
better look inside the chassis so give
me a second alright and now the last
cage is finally removed and here you can
see the interior of the chassis you
actually have a power supply when they
turn it around here there's your power
supply bracket so as I mentioned earlier
the power supply is mounted at the front
of the case and but as you'll notice
there's a plug at the back as I
mentioned so the way that they have
solved the problem of having it mounted
at the front but being able to plug into
the back is this little pass-through
cable right here so just connects from
the back and it has a little L style
plug that plugs directly into your power
supply I move it also there's a little
latch at the bottom here so you can
actually stuff your cable right in there
keep it from moving around too much this
is just a bag of your motherboard
standoffs and mounting screws they've
tied it down to the power supply bracket
to ensure that it doesn't rattle around
or scratch up the inside of your case
when it's being shipped to you and
here's a internal look of the 292
millimeter hydro bearing fans and they
each have three pin connectors three pin
headers as well as very nicely sleeved
cables that are that are black the front
panel connectors right here they've
gracefully zip tied them together or
twist tied them for you and this is
pretty much just your typical
run-of-the-mill front panel header stuff
so you've got your power LEDs indicator
lights hard drive lights power and reset
and stuff like that and then here's your
USB 3.0 internal header if your
motherboard doesn't have a 20 pin
internal header you can still utilize
those two USB 3.0 ports at the front of
the case by using this little USB 2.0
port right here
they'll just be diverted to USB 2.0
speeds at the back of the case here you
can have a internal look at the fan the
rear 140 millimeter fan and there once
again is a 3 pin black braided cable
this is actually your fan connector
cables right here so if you can see
close got a power molex connector as
well as 3 2 pin fan headers so you can
control up to 3 fans at a time with this
controller but keep in mind you can
always you don't have to use this
control
right you can plug in your case fans
into your motherboard fan headers and if
you choose to do that you can actually
remove those cables completely toss them
aside just to free up a little bit more
space in your case when you're dealing
with the micro eight mini ITX chassis
saving any kind of space where you can
is is definitely welcome alright guys I
really quickly wanted to touch on this
before I forget it this chassis actually
does support video cards up to 310
millimeters long so that's like that's
like over 12 inches it's like 12.2
inches or something ridiculous like that
so I could actually fit a reference GTX
680 in here if I wanted to or a
reference Radeon HD 7970 if that were
the case the only thing they have to
keep in mind is that you have to remove
the left leftmost drive cage right here
if you want to fit in a discreet card
that long and you'd still have room for
four more drives right with those other
two bays so that's awesome and the CPU
cooler clearance by the way which would
be right about here
that's actually 165 millimeters so just
to give you guys an idea of how tall it
is I think a hyper 212 Evo is like 159
millimeters so you can actually fit like
that full-size Tower in this Mini ITX
chassis which is really cool because a
lot of times when I'm searching for
parts for a mini ITX build when I get to
the CPU cooler and it's time for me to
pick out a CPU cooler I usually have to
narrow down my search right I have to
search for something that's low profile
or something that's under 100
millimeters height and by the time I get
my search results back it's like one
page of hardware like there's like three
three coolers I can choose from I'm sure
a lot of you guys can relate to this and
that really limits down the
customizability of your build and that's
what you know PC building is all about
so definitely a nice feature with this
bill being such a small form factor
alright guys that is gonna do it for
this unboxing and overview of the note 3
or 4 from fractal design and as much as
I want to do a review of this thing I
just didn't have the components at the
time to actually do a full build and I
feel like if I'm gonna give an honest
review of a chassis I should have built
a system in it in order to give my full
opinion on it but that said I still want
to give some of my thoughts on this
chassis from what I've experienced with
it thus far and that is starting with
the cons I guess because I'd like to end
on a good note these the overall size of
the chassis for a mini ITX chassis it's
it's a little big for a mini ITX Jesse
but that said I still understand where
fractal design was coming from because I
mean you can fit six hard drives in here
you can fit a foot long graphics card a
full-length CPU cooler Tower so if
you're looking just to like save the
most amount of space and you don't want
a powerful Brig you just want something
like a little tiny workstation like nuke
status or something then maybe this
isn't the chassis for you
but what this chassis is for is if you
want really big performance in a very
small space because it allows all that I
mean that's one pro is it has
compatibility up the ying-yang right you
can fit pretty much anything in here as
long as you know is except for the
motherboard form factor of course the
other con I was gonna say not really
combo just to kind of a personal opinion
was just the shape of it overall when I
first saw it I mean it's not necessarily
a tall tower and it's not necessarily
wide it's just kind of square and um
when I first saw it I was just kind of
like well where would I put this thing
you know because it doesn't necessarily
fit really nicely in like a flat wide
shelf of my entertainment center and I
don't know if I could see it like mix to
my TV because it's not like tall and
Tower or whatever but you know personal
opinion stuff but all that aside I still
feel like there should be relatively
easy to find a spot for this guy to sit
just because overall it still has a very
small footprint but moving on to the
pros I didn't want to say that there's a
lot of little fine details in here like
the painters interior the sleeve cables
for all the fans which by the way three
fans 292 millimeter and one 140
millimeter and a mini ITX chassis I mean
that's just like a ton of airflow and
the other thing I want to say is
compatibility once again I mean I could
I could put components in this thing to
make it kick the crap out of the the mid
tower chassis behind me right and aside
from that I also want to say that this
is very versatile it's a very versatile
system so whether you want a ridiculous
gaming rig or you want to make this a a
file server or even an HTTP C for that
matter but aside from that I think
that's gonna wrap it up for this quasi
review huh maybe there will be a part
two someday but thank you all for
