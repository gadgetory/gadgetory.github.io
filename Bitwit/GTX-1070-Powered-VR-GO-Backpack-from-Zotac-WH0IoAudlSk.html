you know what this is
I I posted stuff on Instagram Twitter
about this I've been talking about this
all year it's the VR go backpack from
zotac it is finally here look at there's
even a retail box look at that I better
be able to do that move that guy is
doing with with this product otherwise
it's otherwise it's false advertising
ZOTAC just saying so basically if you
guys have no idea what this is it's
essentially at its core a gaming desktop
PC particularly one that you can throw
on your back using this contraption here
just basically just some backpack straps
that fix this to the back of that I'll
show you a little demo on that later but
you can wear this on your back for a VR
experience and the reason why that's
necessary is because with a headset with
a VR headset and hmd you've got a big
ass tethered cable coming from the back
of it that needs to plug into your
gaming PC which is you know usually on a
desk or somewhere further away from you
and that causes a lot of annoyances with
your feetsies because that you get
tangled up in that cord the cord gets
wrapped around you you got to kick it
off it's really distracting in game and
it brings you out of the whole immersive
experience which is what VR is all about
so this has been a challenge that
vendors have been trying to find a
solution for for quite some time ever
since VR became a thing and this is so
taks first response but the VR go so
we're gonna be taking a closer look at
it today I'm pretty excited actually I
did get to try out the prototype at copy
Tech's but I've never tried out the
retail version that we have here so
should be fun
now the MSRP on something like this
doesn't come cheap there isn't too much
competition in this market as of yet and
this is packin some pretty heavy specs I
will admit so the MSRP you're going to
be looking at is 2000 USD yeah that's
that's quite a pretty penny even for the
specs that are in here but that said you
are getting something very unique you're
getting a very unique type of
functionality that you really can't find
in too many other places so you are sort
of paying for that exclusivity of a
feature now as far as specs go we've got
like I said we're packing some heat here
we've got a core i7 skylake platform
6700 T and that's a quad core chip we've
also got a gtx 1070 that's a fully
fledged desktop GPU no mobile graphics
here so that's going to be doing some
damage and bear in mind like look look
at this the straps are off with the
straps off it just looks like a small
in fact our gaming PC and that's totally
what it is when you take off the strap
so even if you're not hugely into VR
maybe you've got to be our headset and
you want to dabble with it but at the
end of the day this can still be used to
do some triple-a gaming at you know max
settings more or less so that's actually
pretty sweet granted you can also go
completely cordless if you wanted to not
that I don't know why you would unless
you were doing they are but you've got a
pretty intense battery system here I'm
going to get back to that though I'm
going to continue on with the specs
we've got 16 16 gigs of ram actually
give me a second to flip this over and I
can show you the internals so here's the
backplate that I just removed with five
or six little Phillips head screws they
came off very easily and that gives us
access to our internals here
unfortunately we can't see our CPU or
GPU they're actually on the other side
of the PCB there but we do see our RAM
so we've got 2 8 gig sticks these RS o
dims ddr4 21 33 megahertz I believe
giving us a total of 16 gigs here on the
DRAM side of things of course this is
expandable if 16 gigs doesn't tickle
your fancy you want to upgrade that to
32 maybe 64 I don't know if it's support
64 maybe it does don't quote me on that
but you can definitely do 32 if you
wanted to then you are free to do that
quite easily as well you've also got an
m dot 2 slot here with a pre-installed
SSD you get 240 gigs right there it is
preloaded with Windows 10 64 bit it is
the m2 interface once again but not the
PCIe nvme protocol unfortunately it's
using SATA so it's not going to be quite
as fast as something like you know a 960
Pro from from Samsung or anything like
that but it is probably going to help
keep costs of this unit down overall and
then finally you get a two and a half
inch drive bay so this is empty this is
for you to fill up if you wish to you
can install either an SSD or a two and a
half inch mechanical drive right there
for expanded storage and stuff so moving
back over to the front here I did want
to point out that the enclosure for the
most part is made out of this kind of
hard plastic and it's a it's actually
fairly durable it seems like I mean I
wouldn't want to drop it on a hard
surface by any means but I think the
reason why they went with plastic is
just to keep it more lightweight
especially since it's going on your back
so that's good for me that I think this
thing weighs around 10 pounds I can't
remember if that's with or without the
batteries installed but you're looking
anywhere from like 9 to 12 pounds I
would say we're going to find out once I
actually strap this on and do some games
if that's too heavy
from my liking but we'll get back to
that in a sec so that's that's the
enclosure for the most part it does have
some ample ventilation on on these on
the front here as well as on the side so
we're also going to fire up hardware
monitor when we start gaming and I'm
going to be testing the thermals in this
guy because I'm curious to see if this
the cooling solution in here is adequate
as well now as of now you can kind of
see that we're sort of in the desktop
mode of things right we don't actually
have the backpack straps mounted onto
the unit yet so this is kind of just
what you would this is how you would set
it up if you were just using it as a
regular PC and when you're doing that
you don't really need to be cordless as
much as when you're playing VR obviously
so instead of running on battery life
you could just run on the AC core that
they provided there's a port on the back
which I'm going to get to that side in
just a sec so that's all taken care of
but when you are doing a VR experience
when you're in VR you're playing the
game I looked at the battery LEDs on the
on the batteries just lit up cool I'm
glad that's working when you are playing
a game in VR and you are going to be
going cordless in terms of power you are
going to be relying on the battery packs
so they've included two of them in the
package you get you get two gonna have
to buy it buy one seperately or anything
like that and they basically just slot
in to the bays like so that shit is BAE
yo you can see there's actually the
battery LED indicator has two strips
running down it because there's two
batteries that you can install at a time
so this represents battery one this one
represents battery two and they light up
to indicate the battery life however you
don't really want to install both
batteries at once granted you could you
could definitely do that and that would
theoretically give you more playtime but
the reason why I would leave one out is
so that while you're gaming and this
battery starts to drain eventually when
it gets tapped out right before it dies
you can hot-swap this one into this bay
here take this one out and start
recharging it and just continue playing
uninterrupted you couldn't really do
that if you had both batteries installed
and they both died at the same time
you'd be shit out of luck waiting
another two hours for those batteries to
recharge so cool little system that they
have worked out here oh yeah one more
thing estimated play time with one of
these batteries is supposed to be two
hours in game we're gonna verify that
once we actually strap this on and start
playing moving
to the right side of the system here you
get an assortment of different ports
including your DC which is where
obviously your AC power comes from
headphone and mic jacks you get it you
get an SD card reader 4 USB 3 ports
display ports actually 2 display ports
and two HDMI
I believe that's HDMI 2.0 and
DisplayPort 1.4 I'm going to double
check on that though I'll let you up so
I'll let you know if that is anything
different
you also get dual Gigabit Ethernet LAN
as well as a 12-volt DC out and let's
take a look at the top here now the top
is is where your headset would go
alright it makes most sense if you're
going to be using this on your back and
you have an hmd strapped to your face
you're going to want to plug in that
tethered cable into the top here it's
just a bit easier access it makes more
sense based on where the headset is
located so you get your 12 volt DC out
here as well
HDMI and 2 USB 3.0 ports and they do
have these little rubber covers you
don't get any covers for the side there
but you do get them for the top is there
anything that we missed
as far as okay you get some rubber feet
you get rubber feet here if you're going
to be using it in desktop mode I'm just
going to call it desktop mode so it
doesn't slip around when you're when
you're doing it that way and you also
get more rubber feet at the bottom here
when it's standing upright like the
monolith from 2001 Space Odyssey alright
so here we have the backpack strap and
I'm gonna go into all the little details
that this offers in just a bit when I
actually have it suited on but for now
I'm just going to strap it on to the
back of the device here and show you
exactly how that works they've made it
super straightforward and simple
actually so you get three these notches
three holes plus a little slot or a
little opening for a locking mechanism
and on the back of the strap you get
three pegs and the locking mechanism
right here so all you do is you kind of
line that up the pegs with the holes and
you lock it into place like so and to
seal the deal they've given you this
there's a little velcro door just opens
like that it's like it's like a seals
chaps alright and then there's a little
dial here to put the locking mechanism
into place simply close the velcro door
and voila she is not going anywhere
pretty rock-solid super easy I like how
straightforward it is again so that's
how you strap that on I think at this
point
I'm all ready to boot this guy up it's
already got a battery in there so why
don't we go ahead and do some VR testing
see how this baby flies so you strapped
in with these little Clips here they are
adjustable so even if you have big-ass
stomach like myself you should be
perfectly accommodated and then there's
a strap up here as well so I've got the
cables from the hmd all coiled up here
and there is a spot to put them actually
this little stretchy stretchy pocket
thing
stretching strap you can just route the
cables straight through there the other
little stretchy straps are for your HTC
buy of controllers the motion
controllers can go in kind of like
holsters you can see I've got both
controllers there this by the way I'm
fully aware of how ridiculous this looks
but then again you are probably going to
be using something like the VR go inside
of your own house not in public
which I guess makes it a little better
but yeah it looks totally ridiculous
function function is what we're what
we're looking for here today so now that
that's all situated I can go ahead and
put the headset on everything is looking
good I can pull out my controllers let's
just go ahead and play ready to rock am
I gonna be I'm gonna be facing away from
you guys apparently sorry sorry I know
I'm like horrible at this so first thing
I will say is that the backpack is very
comfortable the straps are I mean I
don't know it's one of those things
where like you're so immersed in in
something like VR that you kind of
forget that you're actually wearing
anything
I mean I'm aware that I'm wearing
clothes of course I don't think I'm
naked right now
but as far as like the backpack any kind
of hardware it does feel pretty um
pretty lightweight you don't notice it
too much the backpack definitely stays
on pretty well um oh I got a shield now
I'll do it in this hand please ah oh god
what is this I don't remember this thing
oh I guess this is like a different kind
of shield now uh there was there have
been some serious updates to this game
that I am unaware of
become dead alright so that was my first
game so far
so far so good like no problems it
doesn't feel too heavy which is a good
sign so what an issue that I want to
quickly point out is that I have no idea
what the battery life is on this
backpack right now I don't know if
there's a way that I can see that from
within the hmd so I think the only thing
I can do is really take the hmd off and
either physically look at the battery
LED indicator on the backpack which
means I would have to turn it off or
maybe or maybe have a mirror-like point
point the backpack towards the mirror
and then look over my shoulder and and
look at it that way so that's kind of a
interesting interesting thing that might
need some some fixing
all right let's fire up a different game
now let's go - wait what we got
alright we're gonna play some raw data
so notice I think that I will mention
about this experience so far is that the
gameplay is super smooth again there's a
gtx 1070 in here with a core i7 there
are absolutely no stuttering there's
there's no signs of stuttering or any
kind of lag that I'm aware of it's it's
super smooth oh my god what's the hell
good lord
see that was Oh God what why are they
why don't they have plague that's
creepiest get the swag oh shit oh there
- oh how do you do that
ah no my headsets blowing up whoo
alright so um that was fun that was
honestly just as smooth as like my GT X
1080 system that I would use and after
you remove your headset there's actually
a little clip on the left side left
strap here which you can use to lock
your headset into place so you don't
have to carry around
voila you kind of look like someone in
the military you know with all this
stuff hanging on here on your big ass
vest type of thing but it works the
gameplay experience again with super
smooth I definitely felt like I was
getting that 90 Hertz refresh rate on
both eyes and I think raw data is
probably the most graphically intensive
game that I have that
actually own so I was I was pretty happy
with how that was performing if we take
a look at the back here what I'm bad so
we still have we still have about 80%
battery life if you look at the
indicator there there's five it's a in
increments of 20% and we only have one
green dot missing so we still have quite
a bit of time I mean I was probably only
playing for maybe 20 minutes so I mean I
guess that kind of adds up I'm not doing
math right now
but yeah it definitely feels like
there's still quite a ways to go for
this battery pack which is awesome so we
had to hardware monitor running the
whole time while we were gaining and it
looks like our CPU again the core i7
6700 T got up to 67 degrees Celsius on
the hottest core 66 see on the package
that's actually not bad it's actually
not bad at all let's see how our gtx
1070 did oh wow 70 degrees it topped out
at 70 degrees see guys that's actually
pretty good
I was I was anticipating high seventies
at the very least so theoretically you
do have some thermal Headroom there if
you wanted to do some overclocking on
the GPU you could probably do so no
problem just bear in mind that that
would shorten the battery life quite a
bit I guess it depends on how much
you're overclocking but obviously
dialing in a hefty OC is going to put
more strain on the battery it's going to
require more more power to drive more
pixels and higher frame rates and all
that but you are going to be seeing
significantly reduced battery life but
wrapping things up with some closing
thoughts here overall this is a really
solid product I do like it a lot
performance is top-notch if you want a
high-end vr gaming experience this is
definitely capable of that and it's
gonna be not just good enough for now
but it's gonna be able to play the next
generation of VR games as well so that's
that's also very key you're gonna be
making that initial $2,000 investment
the hotspot mechanism is totally on
point that was kind of like a
make-or-break thing was like how the
battery situation was going to work but
I think overall they made a right choice
also the fact that you can use this as a
regular gaming desktop PC is awesome it
makes it a bit more versatile a lot more
versatile than just if it were like you
know can only be in backpack mode
that would be kind of a bummer so I
think the one complaint that I did have
was that I couldn't really tell what my
battery life was unless I removed the
hmd and looked in the mirror behind me
looked over the shoulder I guess if you
have someone with you they can easily
tell you but that's one thing that I
would try to find a solution for the
straps work pretty well I think having a
good place to hold everything is nice
the I think the cable the cabling
solution could be a little bit cleaner
instead of having to wrap your cables up
like that I think there could be a more
elegant solution to that but I don't
really know what that is at the moment
but for a first run I think this is a
this is just really nice it's it's a
really good product and I would
recommend it if you have the budget but
I think on that note we can go ahead and
wrap this video up so let me know what
you guys think of this thing in the
comments I'm very curious to hear your
thoughts on what you've seen today with
the demo as well as like the specs and
MSRP especially I want to know do you
guys think it's worth the price let me
know in the comments be sure to toss me
a local in the video if you enjoyed it
have a good one you all subscribe if you
haven't already and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
