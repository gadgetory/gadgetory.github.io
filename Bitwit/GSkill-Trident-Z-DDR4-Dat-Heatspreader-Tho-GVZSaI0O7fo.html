arrival of Intel skylake and z170
platform has brought about a number of
changes to the PC industry perhaps the
most significant of these features is
the mainstream adoption of ddr4 memory
and while the platform does allow for
the utilization of both ddr4 and ddr3
modules most motherboard vendors are
jumping on the next-gen bandwagon so for
those of you looking to build a skylake
system in the near future chances are
you'll need to find a working ddr4 kit
as well today I'll be taking a quick
look at one such offering from the team
over at g.skill this is their Trident Z
designed with high-speed performance in
mind for six gen Intel Core skylake
processors before your eyes is a 2 by 8
or 16 gigabyte dual channel kit at 3,000
megahertz though this is on the low end
of what's available as speeds go all the
way up to a blazing 4266 as vendors
continue to raise the bar for memory
speeds it can often feel like our needs
as consumers are increasing at the same
rate but it's important to bear in mind
that the outrageous cost of wicked fast
ddr4 rarely justifies the real-world
gain in most cases meaning you shouldn't
feel outdated for having a sub 3,000
megahertz kit 21 33 megahertz is
currently the jtech official standard
after all on that note I'm going to stop
myself from discussing the finer details
of memory before you all switch over to
watching this video of paint dry it gets
really good about halfway in though
taking a closer look at our tried n Z
modules we can see that they feature a
cast latency of 1515 1535 a theoretical
bandwidth of 24,000 mega transfers per
second and support for XMP 2.0 for
automatically configuring your RAM
timings what caught my eye literally
about this kit however wasn't its resume
of impressive specs but the beautifully
designed heat spreaders elegantly lining
the black PCBs sure there's little to no
use for heat spreaders these days other
than for showy marketing purposes but
g.skill can mark it to me all they want
if they continue to pump out designs
like the Trident Z the two-toned brushed
aluminum plates feature a sporty triple
fin design on both ends with a red
accent strip running down the spine of
the module that together create a
balanced mix of ferocity and class the G
scale and tread NZ branding looks sharp
yet unobtrusive and the overall build
quality here is truly something too
marble suffice it to say this is the
best-looking and highest-quality ddr4
kit I've seen to date and my
request here's that I'd love for g-scale
to release an all-black addition to
match more system builds in the future
while I would have loved to do some
testing with this kit this video had to
be trimmed down significantly so I could
have it ready in time for my two-week
honeymoon in Thailand which I leave for
in just a few days though I will be AFK
till the end of November I do have some
pretty cool videos to post while I'm
away including the long-awaited white
build and my epic sleeper PC so be sure
to stay tuned for that
before you go toss me a like on this
video almost forgot what to say there on
this video if you enjoyed it and also
feel free to leave us some love in the
comments as always I'm kind of awesome
sauce Network thank you guys for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
