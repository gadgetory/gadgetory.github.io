little follow-up to a previous video I
did where I benchmarked two GTX 670 s in
two-way SLI today however I'm going to
be benchmarking two Radeon HD 7870 s in
crossfire X and this is a sapphire card
I actually did an unboxing of this not
too long ago you can check that out if
you haven't already after you've watched
this video of course but in no way shape
or form am i comparing the 7870 to the
GTX 670 because they're in totally
different tiers right did you take with
the GTX 670 being a much more expensive
high-end top-performing card compared to
the 7870 but what I am comparing or at
least taking a look at today is the
difference in scaling between Nvidia
cards and AMD cards when put in SLI or
crossfire X and put to the test with the
given games that I have tested today
as well as some synthetic benchmarks so
without further ado why don't we take a
look at the hardware that I'm using so
I'm still rocking the 2600 K overclocked
at 4400 megahertz
I still have the Z 68 chipset and
motherboard I do promise guys that I'm
going to try my very hardest to upgrade
to a PCI gen3 motherboard in the future
but until then you can see the other
specs there I did update to the latest
13.2 beta 5 catalyst drivers and the
video card specs there on the right 1050
megahertz core clock it is a factory
overclocked out-of-the-box card so keep
that in mind and yeah I think that's
pretty much it all tests were run at
1920 by 1080 so starting with Skyrim and
once again just like the 2-way SLI video
that I did I'm gonna go from least
performance to most performance so
starting with the worst performance as
far as we saw in scaling wise we had
skyrim at 3.4 percent and take a look
just underneath that you can see it's
11.8% scaling with sli so if you notice
FXAA was turned off so FX is naturally
an nvidia technology so I figure like if
I would have turned FX a a
on I wonder if the scaling would have
been even worse because you know maybe
this AMD card isn't really optimized for
FX a
as much as an nvidia card would be so
let's be interesting I should take a
look at that and rerun some tests but as
you can see there SLI definitely
performs quite a bit better with Skyrim
taking a look at Borderlands 2 we can
see 4.6% still not that great
compared to SLI with 15.1% scaling and
once again we had fxaa turned on this
time so that could be a reason why I
took a performance hit as well as
physics so physics is a very toted
feature of Borderlands 2 and I had that
set to high so once again if I would
have set that to medium or even low I'm
pretty sure the scaling performance
would have been higher but not the case
here I wanted to use all the same
settings I did for the two-way SLI video
so that's why they are set to the way
they are moving on to Far Cry 3 we
definitely saw a huge jump here 91.5%
and scaling and this actually beat out
the SLI configuration which only had
72.3% performance increase and I feel
like a huge reason behind this is
because AMD was actually sponsoring far
cry 3 this is one of the games that they
were working side by side with the
developers and when one of the
manufacturers when either AMD or Nvidia
works with the game developer
they're often pouring a lot of money
into driver development and they're also
giving those developers all of their
technology to work with so generally
those games from those developers tend
to perform better with hardware from
that particular manufacturer that was
sponsoring that so here obviously you
can see it basically blew SLI out of the
water
moving on to hitman absolution once
again just incredibly even more southern
Far Cry 3 95.1% scaling as opposed to
33.3% with sli once again this is an AMD
back to game if any you guys have
noticed any of the gaming bundles or
gaming promotions that AMD has been
going on hitman absolution and Far Cry 3
have both been on there so even with
FXAA turned on and and all that good
stuff we still saw just like a massive
increase so
if hitman absolution is the only game
you ever play it's probably worth it to
get an AMD card and even more so get two
of them and crossfire X that
because damn that's pretty damn good
performance right there
battlefield 3 once again we saw a
improvement over the SLI configuration
with the GTX 670 s not by as much mind
to you as hitman or Far Cry 3 but still
a significant amount 96.3% scaling as
opposed to eighty seven point five
percent with SLI which still isn't bad
and that is basically the top performer
as far as scaling goes with the real
world gaming benchmarks moving on to
these synthetic benchmarks at our lowest
point we had Metro 2033 at fifty two
point nine percent and I don't know if
the synthetic benchmarks matter as much
to you guys
I'm personally I'm kind of on the fence
about synthetic benchmarks I really like
them because they're so consistent every
time you're gonna get the exact same run
run through every time you run the
program but does it really tell you
anything about how it's gonna perform in
a real-world situation what do you guys
think just leave a comment in the
section below let me know is it worth my
time for you guys for me to do synthetic
benchmarks or do you just want to see
the real world gaming stuff because I'm
really not sure but here you can see sli
really did outperform crossfire X in
this case with 80.6% and moving on to 3d
mark this is a new one that I have just
added this is the new 3d mark from
future mark guys and it's a pretty cool
test I ran it I ran the fire strike demo
which is basically for DirectX 11 based
hardware and as you can see here I
didn't do it in the last video for the
2-way SLI so I had no results to compare
it to but it's still pretty interesting
nonetheless so the main score the main
score is kind of like a compilation of a
physics score and graphics score and I
kind of wanted to more focus on the
graphics score on this slide just
because it's really just testing the GPU
alone as opposed to the overall score at
all it also faster factors some physics
in there which is basically a lot of
parallel simulations that are being run
on your CPU so here you can see 95.1%
scaling for the graphics score for the
regular fire strike demo
and the for fire strike extreme which is
basically just a more intensive run
I got ninety two point one percent scale
and the max temperatures are there
listed for you in red moving on to a VP
you can see here pretty much the closest
I could find SLI and CrossFireX
compared to each other so ninety six
point zero to ninety five point one
virtually the same I'd say it's a very
negligible difference there and you can
see it's not really clearly optimized
for either one maybe a little bit in
favor of crossfire X and lastly this is
pretty awesome Heaven 3.0 we saw a
hundred and one point two percent in
scaling performance with crossfire X as
opposed to the eighty seven point eight
two percent with SLI so I was pretty
blown away that I actually achieved over
a hundred percent increase in
performance with this test so that was
pretty cool alright guys so after taking
a look at the results what does it all
mean right what does it come down to do
you get an AMD card or do you get Nvidia
card do you go for crossfire X or SLI
and I know you guys hate hearing this
because I know you probably google this
question a million times and searches on
YouTube but it really does boil down to
personal preference yes I said it I know
crucify me it's horrible but it's true
you know because I mean it depends on
your desired functionality at the end of
the day what do you want out of your
gaming experience do you care about
things like physics or fxaa
do you mind if those things are turned
off or disabled in your game do you care
about achieving higher frame rates if
there's no noticeable change in gameplay
experience you know do you tend to find
yourself playing games that are more
generally supported by Nvidia or AMD
these are all questions that need to be
answered before you can make up your
mind and decide which video card or
which manufacturer is right for you so
at the end of the day hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and enjoyed the
