more info lots of gas so but the recent
launch of the RX for 80 AMD has focused
heavily on bringing virtual reality to
the masses by promising a VR capable
graphics card at the 200 ish dollar
price point meanwhile nvidia continues
their use of deep learning technology to
find the meaning of MSRP up until now
we've been seeing VR builds popping up
online ranging anywhere from 700 to
1,000 bucks which isn't exactly in reach
for the majority of gamers at least when
you're my height so it got me thinking
as dangerous as that sounds if we were
to use the RX 480 and follow the minimum
recommended specs for the oculus rift
and HTC vive what's the absolute least
amount of money we could spend on a br
Reddy PC and inevitably what kind of
experience could I hope to achieve in VR
poor or games well instead of building a
fresh system from the ground up I
instantly turn to my Black Friday bill
that I put together last November for
just 400 bucks I'll beat it with the
help of some killer Black Friday and
Cyber Monday deals the rig sported an FX
6300 eight gigs of ram and a Radeon HD
7950 packed snugly inside the fractal
design core 1000 with all those holiday
savings out of the picture however I had
to make a few part changes to maintain
the low cost of the build while hitting
those minimum VR specs so I swapped out
the CPU for an FX 8350 change the
corsair CX power supply for an EVGA 430
while
unit tossed out the g-scale RAM for some
cheaper HyperX fury modules in the same
capacity and of course replaced the 7950
with the rx 488 gigabyte reference model
what I was left with apart from more
empty retail boxes was a five hundred
and fifty five dollar PC that was fully
via already at least on paper and
according to the 6.7 score in our
steamvr performance test now if I'm
being fully transparent you might think
I was a ghost you might have also
noticed that I swapped out the old AMD
stock cooler for a fancier Wraith I had
lying around but I left the CPU running
at stock speeds as such this cooler swap
should not affect our gaming performance
I just couldn't hear myself think with
the old stock cooler which I have since
donated to my deaf cousin who thought it
was so ugly he donated it to our deaf
and blind cousin now initially I plan to
overclock the AR X 480 for today's
testing but after sources like Tom's
hardware and PC perspective reveal that
the card was drawing power significantly
outside the spec of the motherboards
PCIe slot I've decided to stick to stock
speeds until aimed he releases a driver
update to fix the issue
this topic is thicker than a black man's
taste in white women so if you want more
info I put links to some relevant
articles in the description and with
that it's time to put the system through
its paces so today we'll be testing five
games on the vibe and another five games
on the rift remember that in the best
case scenario we're going to want to see
an average of 90 FPS to match the
refresh rate of the headset lenses and
relatively consistent frame times with
few irregularities of course none of
that data really matters if we're not
getting a perceptibly smooth and
enjoyable experience so starting with
our set of games for the HTC vive let's
take a look at hollow point and you'll
have to excuse the crappy footage
quality of my monitor here but I didn't
want a fraps or OBS screen cap recording
to affect the performance results in
hollow point we saw an average of 87 fps
just shy of our 90 FPS goal while there
were some dropped frames introduced
there was too few of them for me to
really notice any stuttering whatsoever
coming from my core i5 PC sporting a gtx
980ti visually I could see no difference
with our budget PC frame times were in
good shape as well averaging 11
milliseconds with 99% of all frames
staying within 22 milliseconds the our X
480 stays at a moderate 75 degrees
Celsius on average with zero thermal
throttling and also notice how we're
only using 30 to 40% of our CPU and
memory a trend we end up seeing with all
the games tested on the live things go a
bit haywire when we switch over to hover
junkers though averaging 69 FP
us with inconsistent frame times the
data points are nowhere nearly as
grouped together as we saw in Hollow
Point indicating frequent instances of
judder and framedrops that made the
experience less than ideal job simulator
brings us back to solid gaming with 85
FPS on average which again we're losing
some frames here but not enough to
perceptibly notice so this game was a
super smooth run through in our headset
similar results were had in space pirate
trainer averaging 85 FPS and consistent
frame times across the board this game
was an absolute joy to play on our poor
man's PC saving our most graphically
demanding vive title for last the
gallery called the starseeds scored just
60 FPS on average with frame time plot
points that are divided worse than a bad
boob job frame time variants constantly
switched between 11 and 22 milliseconds
plaguing the game with constant judder
and making the overall experience quite
unpleasant on a side note it's worth
mentioning that the gallery utilized
over five gigs of VRAM so there is a
fair chance that the four gig rx4 ad
will be constrained for memory buffer at
some point when playing VR now with two
out of the five games on the HTC vive
performing less than adequate I was a
bit nervous to try out the rift but I
had also forgotten for a moment that the
vive titles are still not quite as
developed and often feel like unfinished
products compared to what you might find
in the oculus store so strapping into
the rift I was delighted to see an
average of 89 fps in the climb with
solid frame timings whose occasional
spikes went unnoticed to my eyes here we
see our CPU and memory are being
utilized significantly more than they
ever were in the vive but not quite to
the point where we should be concerned
as we'll see in the rest of our rip
titles the GPU load of the arts 480 also
fluctuates considerably
whereas we saw mostly a constant 100%
usage with all of our HTC vive titles
whether that's due to rift games using
GPU resources more wisely or simply
being less demanding is hard to say and
will likely vary from game to game a
Valkyrie was another title that showed
great results 88 FPS on average and
delivering a tightly grouped set of
frame times that paved the way for an
incredibly immersive and smooth
experience the game scored horribly
however in my motion sickness test again
with Apollo 11 we see a strong average
FPS and beautiful frame times with the
99th percentile scoring just twelve
speedy milliseconds sounding like a
broken record now Lucky's tale was a
walk in the park
yielding solid numbers all around while
barely taxing the hardware of our VR
beater rig finally an oculus dream deck
we only signed 81 FPS average our lowest
score on the rig
we shouldn't hold those extreme frame
time spikes against it though since that
data is a result of the screen going
black when switching between scenes and
the demo still this was the only test on
the rift where I experienced some
occasional judder when moving my head
quickly side to side and even then it
was quite minimal compared to the few
sluggish titles on its rival platform
overall it appears that our humble PC
here delivers a rich and fluid VR
experience for the oculus rift but tends
to be more hit or miss when it comes to
the HTC vive I'll have to keep a close
eye to see if that trend continues as
more polished vive titles hit the steam
store while this build might be a bit
underpowered for someone looking into
the vibe at the same time I'd almost
expect someone on this tight of a budget
to have their eyes set on the more
affordable rift sure you'll have to pick
up the oculus touch controller
separately later this year but buying
your VR set up a piece at a time might
just be the way to go if you're strapped
for cash now a final thought to consider
when building around minimum spec
requirements is that while they're good
enough for today there's no guarantee
they'll be well suited for the next wave
of VR content it's kind of like buying
pants that barely fit while the
McDonald's dollar menu continues to grow
more compelling with that in mind I
would suggest waiting to see what NVIDIA
has up their sleeve with the GTX 1060
but as of filming this video I remain
impressed with the price to performance
of the rx 480 and the VR experiences
we've managed to achieve with this 550
dollar machine that's gonna do it for
now guys so let me know what you think
