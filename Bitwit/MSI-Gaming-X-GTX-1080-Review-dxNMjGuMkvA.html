signings three here I think you're gonna
love them nice can't wait to check these
out thanks by the way my car broke down
and I was wondering if you kept
what's the whoa whoa whoa whoa hey hey
stop it stop don't don't know what's
happening hey be quiet in here Oh Kyle
wasn't prepared to be blown away by the
new silent wings three fans from be
quiet are you for a cooler quieter
system click on the link in the
description for more info what's up gas
today I'm checking out a custom GP 104
card from MSI this is the gaming x GT X
1080 and it's been fitted with the
latest twin frozer six cooler to achieve
lower temperatures improved acoustics
and higher overclocks
than Nvidia's GTX 1080 founders Edition
which we won't be able to make a direct
comparison to today because like an
idiot I water-cooled the only one I had
rendering it fashionably useless I would
have fired myself for incompetence but I
hate confrontation rest assured I'm in
the process of obtaining a second
Founders edition for future reviews and
we will be taking a look at this card's
gaming performance across seven
different applications before we dive
into the benchmarks though here's a
quick look at the specs of MSI's card
which show a fairly aggressive factory
overclock when using the OC mode in
MSI's gaming app this setting takes the
base clock to seventeen hundred and six
megahertz and the boost to 1847
megahertz
that's a 114 megahertz gain over the
founders Edition out of the box not
inside the box though we don't know what
happened inside the box the memory clock
also sees a bump to ten thousand and one
hundred and eight megahertz while the
other specs stay true to the reference
model including the eight generous
gigabytes of gddr5 X on a 256 bit bus
now I'm going to refrain from discussing
the cards cooler in depth today since
I've already covered the Twin Frozr X
extensively in my gaming X gtx 1070
review but there are some features worth
reiterating for starters the fans only
spin up once the GPU exceeds 60 degrees
Celsius so the card will stay silent
until you attack her with a heavy load
do monetize the cooler spans 279
millimeters long and has a significant
height of 140 millimeters which can pose
potential clearance issues and
exceptionally compact small form-factor
jassi's MSI has added some LEDs on the
card to keep twelve-year-olds for
rioting and the lights can be configured
or disabled in the gaming software you
also get a lovely metal backplate with
ample ventilation on the side of the
card is an 8 pin and 6 pin power plug
which allows for greater OC stability
and finally you get the usual assortment
of display outputs for DVI HDMI 2.0 B
and 3 DisplayPort 1.3 powering up the
card I was able to manually push the
clock speed past its factory overclock
with a 150 megahertz offset taking our
max core clock speed to 2075 megahertz
I was pleased to see our GPU maintain
this frequency with no signs of thermal
throttling and I reckon we could have
easily hit 2.1 gigahertz with some minor
over bolting assuming they had
permission from their parents apart from
being a solid overclocker the card
stayed wonderfully cool never topping 72
degrees Celsius under load that's just 2
degrees warmer than MSI's gtx 1070 and 4
degrees cooler than EVGA s GT X 1080 for
the wind per my review what's equally
impressive is that the Twin Frozr 6
keeps thermals in check at very little
expense to the acoustics
clearly the card is whisper quiet and
still manages to stay 10 degrees cooler
than the GTX 1080 founders Edition this
one doesn't count for testing all
applications were run on my ex 99
Broadwell a testbed with a 69 50 X at 40
300 megahertz 32 gigs of DDR 4 3800 and
an Asus x99 Strix motherboard rocking
the 370 2.5 for wickel driver on Windows
10 on that note let's see how the gaming
X GT x 1080 fared in today's tests
so there you guys have it as you might
expect the GTX 1080 completely
obliterates the frame rates at sub 4k
resolutions topping 100 FPS at 1440p in
three of the five games tested while
it's not the 4k 60fps behemoth that is
the tight necks it still did hit 60fps
or higher in the majority of games which
is nothing to scoff at overall I'm
really happy not just with the
performance of this card but it's
exceptional cooling and acoustic profile
throw in some additional features like
LEDs and a reinforced backplate and MSI
is seemed to check all the boxes for
what a solid aftermarket GPU should
entail on a final note the pricing of
this card is super jacked up on Amazon
at the moment so if you are gonna pull
the trigger you might want to try out
new egg where it's about a hundred bucks
cheaper but that's gonna do it for now
guys so for all of you GT X 1080 owners
out there let us know in the comments
which board partner you're currently
using and how it's been treating you so
far before you guys go don't forget to
toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it and check the description
below for some awesome shirts depicting
PC parts in peril as always thank you
guys for watching subscribe to the

will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
