to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or don't alright guys
so if you take a look at this this is
the captain IX from deep cool many of
you guys have already seen this cooler
it's one of the most recognizable a iOS
in the market right now just because it
has a really unique look but you can see
it's actually changing colors right now
which is not something it did before
because it now has where's the sign RGB
LED integration which is pretty sweet
right now this is kind of a prototype so
it's not completely fleshed out but the
final retail version will have this
little adapter so you get a little
controller here that's going to connect
directly to the AO and it's going to
allow you to basically change to up to
sixteen point eight million different
colors in any way you choose there's
also lighting effects as well so that's
pretty sweet to top things off they've
also included this magnetic RGB strip so
you can place this anywhere in your case
assuming that you know you've got a
longer metal surface to work with and it
will sync perfectly with the LED on the
actual waterblock to whatever your
heart's content so that's that's pretty
cool MSRP I believe is twenty dollars
more than what the non RGB captain DX is
so pretty reasonable for those who are
looking for the utmost customization in
their systems one thing I want to
mention is that this is the 240
millimeter radiator version it does come
in two 140 as well and hopefully we're
gonna be able to see this in black and
white according to the reps here again
this is coming in March so stay tuned
for that alright guys so you remember
the Tri stellar welcome to the quad
stellar so this thing is pretty beastly
and the reason why I already like it a
little bit more than the Tri stellar is
because it supports full ATX not just
mini ITX so there's a ton more
functionality you can squeeze into this
bad boy look at this drive drive
situation here pretty ridiculous get two
USB 3.0 ports on their full tempered
glass we're gonna get back to this front
area in a second or something pretty
cool that might be able to show you RGB
LEDs there's an RGB controller that's
inside here right behind that panel that
you can pretty much get access to
anywhere from you know zero to sixteen
point eight million colors no big deal
and we've also got this ridiculous setup
for for graphics cards you've got three
PCIe slots right there by sixteen you
can see that they're completely
separated from the motherboard which
actually gets mounted underneath I can
see some grommets in there
they're not actually letting us access
in here because it's kind of prototype
II but from what you can tell does look
like some there's some decent cable
management I mean it's obviously pretty
large it's a pretty out of a banana for
scale unfortunately but it is it is
pretty sizable however it's made of
aluminum so it does stay relatively
light for its size and the thing I want
to say about these panels is that they
look closed right there they're super
close right now right so it kind of
looks a little bit restrictive but
there's actually temperature sensors
inside the chassis and when it gets past
a certain threshold these panels will
actually automatically open up to allow
more airflow inside the chassis so
that's pretty cool and that's that
already comes pre pre done you can
actually adjust that threshold as you
see fit for whatever your thermal
requirements may be and that's pretty
much it I think they said they're trying
to keep this around the 300 dollar MSRP
mark which I believe is a little bit
cheaper than try stellar actually so
that's super exciting to see all right
guys that is gonna wrap it up my
coverage of deep cool here at CES 2017 I
want to give a huge shout out to my
sponsors before I go MSI fractal design
and cable mod go ahead and check out
their stuff in the description below and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
