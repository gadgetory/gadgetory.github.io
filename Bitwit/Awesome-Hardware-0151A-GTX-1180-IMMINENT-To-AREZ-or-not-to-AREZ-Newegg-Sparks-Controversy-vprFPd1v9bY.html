that's how all this that's all the
streaming stuff works oh yeah this
little little spark of electricity
that's how you that's how YouTube works
it's handed live streaming it's hamster
hamster exploitation hamsters gerbils
I'm triggered right now any any kind of
small rodent I'm boycotting all stream
with decent you know food intake to
power output ratio that would be kind of
cool to make a hamster build we actually
have the the like a hamster wheel in
there and you have the hamsters actually
crank the fans some hands to the wheel
and it's all hamster cooling is what it
whenever you game their hamster just
strapped in a box full of hot air just
extreme heat get incinerated you know
that's why they got to keep that's why
they gotta keep running they run or they
overheat then they have to find that you
know negative reinforcer you teach them
what life that life is all about balance
these millennial hamsters are so
entitled these days everything anyway
welcome to the show mister hello
everyone hi guys welcome back this is
awesome hardware episode 151 and it's
not a tech like Picardie like Bacardi
yes they're very very good Paul brings
me back to my college days from what I
can remember and this is a tech show
that we like to talk about tech on and
you know have a few drinks so if you're
of legal drinking age feel free to drink
along with us or you know it's not thank
you we occasionally will use foul
language only when appropriate because
there is an appropriate time to use film
in which trust me about language warning
yes so you've been warned and let's see
we sell stuff dude my store is bit
McDuck tech slash store where you can
find a smorgasbord of various items
including desk pads mouse pads shirts
shirts glasses mugs sale on this and so
forth there is a sale on the evolution
gamepad that's an ultra-wide
it's an ultra-wide it's actually super
ultra wide desk matt paul also has them
on his store
that specific one but I think that's
beside does the oxblood the oxblood
thumb structure your shirts hoodies some
hoodies up now Guess's bottle openers
metallic hoodie metallic is that new
limited edition super metal what is this
what's going on here
pol sure I'm sure getting familiarized
with his own store right now and there
was a few weeks back we talked about
putting some new stuff up and I was like
cool and then that's how automated John
makes everything for us well rich guy is
just so on top of it explore the new
merch yeah let us know if it's cool
we'll shop will shout John that you at
the end of the stream if you happen to
pick something up from either of our
stores that's all real nice it's all
real good stuff high-quality um that's a
shirt you damn traitor if you never be
wearing those competitors our biggest
rivals merchandise on this show he
barely paid me any money to it was like
wow it was like just a few grand Steve's
like worried about shirt whoa wait here
is several thousand dollars in unmarked
bills don't tell anyone about this so
you're saying that you're you're
shilling for I saw a youtuber who
constantly is accused of being a show
yes like she'll sections act now yeah my
guys he actually pays other people to
show for him you're a shill of a shill
you're you're all shells and I sold this
advertising space on your show which I'm
also proud of I am I'm very upset
hmm this is why I have to counteract it
with my with my own brand my own state
pause had a shirt pocket bump so that's
also in the store you like a message I
like the message of that it is a very
positive message for lack of a better
phrase um all right so that's that let's
go ahead and dive into our first segment
of the day which is hot and heavy
hardware we're talking about hardware
that's hot and heavy Wow I was perfectly
I'm not I'm not super prepared for this
show this is my half of the show when we
get to any is gonna be on the shorter
side that's okay but it looks like I am
it really does so I shouldn't have said
that I could have maintained that you
could have fooled everyone
I never mind the ruse is gonna mind
everything that's gonna be perfect in
awesome it's okay it's gonna be and will
distract the most minute with dancing or
something at some point first articles
from PC world are
buddy ol pal Gordon Mong wrote this one
Gordy and it's about the razor blade the
new razor blade 15.6 inch model there's
actually a lot of fun little video to go
along with it with Gordon himself this
is a new razor blade and I really like
the form factor here 15.6 inches I think
is a sweet spot for just kind of
everyday use the 13 inch Mac sorry Mac
razor blade Pro or razor blade was a
little bit small for my liking very
portable it made it very light and easy
to travel with
nothing 15.6 inch gives you a bit more
screen screen real estate there it's a
sweet spot it is a nice sweet spot
especially if you're gonna be gaming on
it so what's what's the deal here 0.66
inches tall this is a damn borderlining
you know this is definitely under
Ultrabook category or territory if you
say the specs here and 8th gen 6 core i7
8750 h it's also the same as the msi
ge62 5 stealth so I guess it makes it a
competitor look at the copper in that
cooling helicoper me it is 4 or 5 pounds
so that's probably probably due to the
the copper because I believe that
they're still going with an aluminum
unibody and whatnot or I don't know if
it's a unibody but definitely aluminum
frame the screen is there's two options
here there's two models that you can
choose from there's a 1920 by 1080
screen at 144 Hertz or a 3840 basically
a 4k panel or screen which is it didn't
didn't say it's 60 Hertz obviously both
of these are IPs and factory color
calibrated
you can also spec out the GPU as you see
fit down from a GTX 1060 max Q max Q all
the way up to a gtx 1070 max Q you also
get some SSD options PCIe of course 512
gig up to 2 terabyte I don't want to
know how much that that spec costs up to
32 gigs of DDR 4 2667 Ram Thunderbolt 3
is onboard perky lit keyboard as well
and typical Razer RGB fashion um so if
you want to get the base model at the
1060 GTX 1060 and a 256 gig SSD that
also comes along with the
1080p 60 Hertz panel so there's also a
1080p 60 Hertz panel well that'll start
at 18 99 $15.99 that is way cheaper than
I did I expected this is in a perfect
world where we can all rejoice and be
happy about MSRP s that would be nice
but I know this is actually eight
hundred or closer to around $1,900
$1,900 that isn't quite where the
decimal was in your life and your
initial thought a lot more it is a lot
more um the top-end 4k is even more than
that the 4k version with a touch
touchscreen and whatnot 16 gigs of ram
512 GB SSD and of course the gtx 1070
max-q
will go for a whopping $2,900 thanks
that's almost I think that's about as
much as a base level razor blade row row
base level but still a lot bigger and
stuff it sure is yeah 17 18 inch screen
GTX 1080 so um but yeah I mean it looks
really nice it looks kind of like they
straightened out some of the edges like
the overall design of the actual unit
looks a bit sharper in my opinion I feel
like the the razor blade last gen was a
kind of more rounded features this one
looks more like just like like an actual
razor very sharp and very square and the
bezel is so much thinner which I very
much like yeah it almost goes out to the
edges and yeah it's yeah that was the
one thing about the razor blade at least
the one I have is just the bezels are so
huge it looks it just looks low doesn't
look all that great and you kind of miss
out on some of that space so that's
what's going on with razor they'll get a
new laptop check it out
that's it next up we have an article
from Engadget reporting on nvidia
quietly unveiling a new graphics card
kind of this it's the gtx 1053 gigabyte
model okay so you know we already have
the gtx 1050 2 gigabyte and we have a
gtx 1050 TI 4 gigabyte but this is the
first gtx 1050 that has three gigs of
gddr5 and it's got a faster base clock
but a lower memory bandwidth of 84
gigabytes per second compared to
112 gigabytes per second for the other
two models it has the same number of
CUDA cores as the TI which is nice which
also means that it'll probably run about
10% faster than the GTX 1050 2 gigabyte
card according to Nvidia 10% faster for
you know a few bucks more right now the
MSRP for the 2gig gtx 1050 is about a
hundred and nine dollars and then it's
about a hundred and thirty nine dollars
for the TI if it's that's good sure just
ignore all of this pretend those like
you're trying to save what's the
framerate no this is relative oh my
government 1x to Equus the chart
baseline what accident
that's horrible horrible Nvidia I mean
they're always confusing I mean that's
how much does this cost what do we price
hasn't been unveiled yet but somewhere
in between what a 1052 gig and a 1050
ti4 gig would cost you so street prices
street prices are a different story
right so you could probably estimate
anywhere from 50 I would say anywhere
from forty to sixty dollars more than
MSRP at the time of this broadcast with
GPU rates being what they are so if it's
if it's MSRP for 125 then let's just say
180 to 200 for for one of these guys
when they first launched which you know
isn't the most ideal but that is the
situation I don't know do we need this
card have we been long it seemed it
seems like it doesn't seem very close in
performance to a 1050 Ti right so I just
can't see I don't feel like this is
hitting any sort of demo that the other
two cards around it weren't so you still
have to pay like a hundred and eighty
hundred ninety bucks for a 1050 Ti right
now I think if you want to buy one so if
you suddenly launches and you can buy it
and it's a thermos or
and it's a hundred twenty bucks or
something then then maybe that will fill
a need for a certain you know number of
people who just want to build a
relatively cheap gaming PC that'd be
great but I mean the odds of that
happening are pretty low and you say
well I mean with the lower amount of
memory memory can be an issue with
mining depending on what you're mining
and stuff so that might deter some
miners from from being interested in
buying it and yeah I mean I guess it
just depends on availability and if you
can actually buy it and what the price
actually is so yeah cuz gtx 1050 s
aren't hitting nearly as bad inflation
wise as the 1050 t is mainly because as
Paul said you I think three digs of VRAM
is the sort of minimum recommendation
for mining aetherium for example so the
idea here is that with the gtx 1053 gig
it kind of barely it gets as close to
being inflated as possible our or gets
close to as close to being desirable by
by minors as possible without actually
being targeted at miners which meant
might allow it to the 2gig ten fifty s
they're selling four hundred and these
are sold out need your for about 150 and
these are similar yeah that's about
that's about $40 more than MSRP the
cheapest ten fifty two gig you can get
is one hundred and sixty-five dollars at
Newegg right now so that's still pretty
ridiculous
yeah I know yeah and maybe so maybe we
could I would imagine that's the price
that's probably the lowest price we
could see one of these ten fifty four
gig I'm sorry three gig cards go for is
around one hundred and sixty maybe one
hundred and seventy bucks but we'll just
have to see um you guys let us know yet
if if this does anything for you what
your thoughts are our next articles from
hexxus X talking about the NZXT th 500
and H 500 I'm mid towers that launched
that
that were announced and launched I guess
they haven't officially launched
launched it's it's not going to be
available some until mid-june so gamers
Nexus reviewed the H 500 okay so um the
article says available before mid-june I
mean it's before mid-june now so maybe
they're available now I haven't really
checked but there's there's two models
here h 508 500 i they're very similar
and the fact that they both have a
tempered glass side panel they have a
power supply basement that sort of
innovative cable management on behind
the motherboard tray that we've seen
them like the H 700 I it kind of looks
just like you know it's the the design
of the case kind of reminds me if like
the s 340 elite and an H 700 I had a
baby
I believe the H 500 is replacing the s
340 in their lineup okay that makes a
lot of sense it is now it is now in each
case instead of an S case yes and it
looks like the tempered glass doesn't
really span the entire side it looks
like it's kind of cut off
I believe it touches it tucks right
under this lip ring right which so I
don't know who I filled out that I'm I'm
okay with it that at least I didn't
fantex have a case that kind of had them
the tempered glass mount that way aid
the p300 it was okay for me cuz it was
an it was secure enough down there that
you could set it in place and like
that's the only time the tempered glass
your mounting irritates me is like the
ones that just have the four screws
going out and they're not long enough
and you're setting it there and then you
have to get the first screws in yeah
it's like if there's any moment where
you set it there and you have to like
take your hands off it where it could
like easily fall off like them that's
what freaks me out so I'm true yeah from
a practical standpoint I just mean from
from an aesthetic standpoint I kind of
like the clean just all tempers less
personal thing but it's still a very
handsome looking case that being said
tempered glass basement it's got a
removable water cooling bracket at the
front that can support up to 280
millimeter radiators that's pretty nice
that's cool looks like dual USB three at
the front there on the front panel power
button no type C no type C unfortunately
and with the price point I probably
wouldn't I wouldn't expect it to be type
C compatible if
their next generation of case than it
should have the next generation of a
connection again yes I wish in a perfect
world that they all the new cases in
2018 head type-c may be in 2019 will
finally catch on to that trend so $95 us
about I'm just converting this from the
the great British pounds that was listed
in hexes hexes this article so $95 US
for the H 500 and 135 dollars
thereabouts for the H 500 the difference
between the non eye and the eye skews is
that the eye model will get you the sort
of a built-in smart device that we saw
in the H 700 eye which is basically like
an RGB and digital fan controller that
will basically use machine learning and
all that crap to generate automated fan
curves based on you know different
Gnostics and in your system you could
like talk to it and ask it to schedule
appointments for you and stuff yes it's
got a whole built-in built-in Google
assistant no that's not true
that'd be pretty sweet though you also
get two pre-installed fans with the H
500 I but the article didn't specify if
these are a or RGB fans I would assume
so because there's a much bigger focus
here on the illumination and the
lighting I'd also comes with LED strips
integrated RGB lighting vertical GPU
mount although a riser card is not
included so if you'd like RGB and you
want to do a vertical mount and you want
that smart device then go with the I
model if you don't care about any of
that stuff
the non-ai is virtually the same there's
a picture of the flip side of the H 500
this is from gamers Nexus review on it
that they posted today they also said
that the cooling was middle-of-the-road
okay not great but fine yeah I mean
where is it even getting its intake from
I mean there's gaps at the sides of the
Front's okay because I couldn't tell
from the 3d generally I believe the the
generated pictures or whatever yeah so
there's the gamers Nexus is set it was
looking pretty fly these days
well they got that the peg talked about
it's all about the pegboard it is about
the pegboard looks good so that's that
we can move on to our next piece of harp
maybe hardware which is what happened to
that camera sorry which is from Samsung
preparing their 49 inch 50 120 by 1430
displays for the heads-up chat I'm not
sure why the camera froze Oh weird we're
good now though yeah yep cool so this
article is from hot hardware how
appropriate that it should be featured
on hot and heavy hardware haha and this
is a sort of Samsung's follow-up to
their CH g90 that they released last
year which was the 49 inch super ultra
wide super ultra wide 144 hertz panel
that had a kind of polarizing resolution
of 3840 by 1080 1080 vertical isn't
acceptable and I did a review on this
monitor actually pretty recently and
specified or mentioned in my review that
this resolution is definitely not for
anyone you're essentially taking to 1920
by 1080 monitors smashing them together
which can feel very vertically
challenged for lack of a better term but
this panel will actually have a cool
resolution count to 1440 which i think
is a bit more reasonable okay
so 50 120 by 1440 this is known as all
these new with every new resolution
comes a new terminology or no what's it
so it's dual quad HD duel or DQ HD
alright so I mean I guess that makes
sense because you know you're being you
basically have to 2560 by 1440 panels
smashed together so it's kind of like I
find that acceptable yeah it is it's
just fun to see all these new terms come
about again this will be a 120 a 120
Hertz panel which is slightly down from
144 Hertz with the chg 90 but that makes
sense because we have more more pixels
to push so maybe you can't get away with
there's not quite as much bandwidth to
get 144 Hertz at this higher resolution
it still maintains an 1800 our curve
which i think is not just good but
necessary for a panel this wide because
I believe this is a VA panel if it's
gonna be like the chg 90 and already
went with a CH D 90 if you
the just looking at the the corners the
the edges the far edges of the screen
you start to see some color distortion
just a little bit of distortion because
the viewing angle isn't the greatest you
have to like turn your head completely
from one side to the other to look yeah
and like if you have text that's just
right on the edge of the screen then
it's a little bit harder to read because
the screen so wide that all of a sudden
you look to the very left or right of
your screen and you're looking from a
pretty extreme viewing angle so it makes
sense for it's almost practical for a
screen this size and this wide to have a
curve to it which i think is a smart
move we haven't confirmed this yet but
I'm gonna assume that this is gonna
support freesync too very much like its
predecessor and possibly HDR since
that's all the rage these days with
high-end gaming monitors um and I'm not
exactly sure how much this is gonna
retail for the chg 90 is around a little
shy of $1,000 right now I would assume
this one's gonna be around a thousand
maybe 1,200 because you get more pixels
and stuff like that a couple more bells
and whistles but wait this the the 1080
vertical one is it just like 1000 yeah
yeah yeah I would I would expect this to
be 1200 to 1500 then yeah mm-hmm yeah
all right or or who knows maybe they'll
keep it closer to a thousand and then
drop the price of the CH g9b if they're
not selling many of those it is it is a
like a more elegant solution than like a
dual monitor setup if that's what we're
going for and then especially if you
wanted a game on it I mean gaming on two
monitors is pretty silly
you know three is acceptable but you got
the bezels in between right but this
kind of yeah that could be fun yep so
that's that um moving on here this is
our last article for hot and heavy
hardware which is about the Acer
predator X 27 this is the 4k 144 Hertz
panel HDR and all that jazz that's been
listed for pre-order pretty early on new
egg for a whopping $2,000 Wow 2,000
bucks
finally we know the price of this
monitor that's been touted all over the
web
for months now it has wings it has wings
it gives you wings you know why does it
have wings I guess you can't wear your
hat can no land cheating I don't like
this hair really I don't know I think
maybe it's to keep light out or
something that would expect it to be for
glare yeah right but that's that's what
I mean yes maybe if you're bringing it
to a LAN party then yeah you know I
guess a bit of protection for the person
sitting maybe if they're like trying to
target to like eSports you know you want
the guy looking over you or whatever
sitting next to you I'm not sure no but
yeah people are saying check its for
glare that's got the knobby doodle you
and I were correct Paul it's got a
little old knob joystick looks like
lobby guy
this means that that photo team at
Newegg has already gotten their hands on
these right either that or the board
that Acer provided them with all these
years it's ramps that's that's the case
I mean it's hard to know these these
these look very precise ah the new new
the photo team they do really good job
so it's sometimes hard to tell the
difference between these professional
manufacturer photos first estate
professional retailer photos yeah at any
rate um if you also look do it release
date where Oh June 1st that's in about a
week or so this so limit limit one per
customer can't be lining three these up
nah bummer but hey people are already
answering questions why did you choose
this person who obviously can't even own
the product yet this alright this is
supported wait someone asked that why
did you choose this yeah who knew egg I
don't I don't know anyway guess that it
says no a new I guess that
yeah automatically to someone who
pre-orders it I guess okay then they
said need to automated email because
it's the only monitor that has the
specifications it has probably that's
yeah so yeah if you've got two thousand
dollars just lying around there's just
like man I really wish that I found
something who doesn't
I mean exactly yeah but we all have that
problem well what are we going to do
with this spare two thousand dollars
guys Oh life sucks it's looking for well
something to spend it on here's
solution to all of your heart problems
all right that's that's hot and heavy
hardware let's do some pit mouthpiece
things these guys by the all who sent in
some submissions of your crappy rigs
that suck and we're gonna tell you how
you can make them less crappy I'm not
I'm just kidding we try to be nice about
it
we provide aesthetic feedback when I
build only an attempt and then attempt
to give you ideas on how to make your
build look prettier that is very
accurate so let's start with Caesar all
right
Caesar concepción core i7 core i7 5820k
and the Asus deluxe x99 motherboard and
gigabyte g1 gaming GTX 1080i 16 gigs BTR
for 2666 crucial and a bunch of other
stuff
he led he led with the cable management
picture he sure did we got a brave soul
what's looking here 540 yep yes err 540
case from Corsair and yeah vertical GPU
mount yeah I'm doing the vertical GPU
mount actually looks pretty nice
especially when you move around and it's
not right up against the side panel
exactly that's not start for you okay um
side panel on I like that shot too
interestingly you have to wait what what
are you talking about the first thing I
was gonna point out is that you have two
fans that are red the red and red ring
and there's really nothing else in your
system that's Reds they kind of stick
out to me but they don't you can't see
them on the side panels on and if you go
to the picture
yeah it's truth blocked that's true
that's true that's true
sometimes it sometimes they still
bothers me I only say no things if I
know it's there okay so white rings
those are interchangeable those fans
come with white rings there's a pair of
dirty shirts on the floor under the
table Oh God hey better the shorts and I
just couldn't help but notice that it's
really it's how do you know those are
shorts it looks like shirts I'm gonna
say those are shorts I guess they could
potentially be pants but yeah anyway
all right no I feel like he's really
asking for feedback on this picture
because he led with it
yeah man do you have a method of cable
management's or drapery or what what
have you here that perhaps you know you
don't see often I want it I want to dub
this it's like a it's like a cyclone
it's like a twister it is yep they're
wrapping the one cable around the other
I've actually done similar cable
management to this in the past I was
gonna say now I've seen it like this
before
yeah maybe not to this extreme but I
have definitely seen you do this
performs like front panel connectors
yeah smaller cables just a way to eat up
some of the excess cabling without it
going everywhere right so I will say
that I appreciate the you know perhaps a
slight bit of increased airflow that you
get from this here but I wouldn't say
it's like showroom ready I don't think
it looks especially good
no definitely not it's that which is
probably why he reserved it from this
side of the case and enough the beauty
side yeah that's true because you know
over here look at this people won't be
able to see anything relative also the
the the cable coming off of your water
block is a little bit loose let's
flailing out there over the dims yeah
right here I took that it should be that
is the one thing that I feel like should
be should be handled right but apart
from that very clean cable management on
this side of things
so great great build there say sir gee
thank you in gee thank you for sending
that over next is we do boy we borrow
eight Jesse Joey days Corsair carbide
spec oh one with an Asus a 78 M - a
motherboard this is a slightly older

several hard drives an 80 gig is there
really an 80 gig hard drive in here that
is that is interesting I've have thumb
drives that have mark fasting well I
have like a 500 gig thumb drive so I get
said that
anyway um all right power supply my god
power supply power supply power supply
what is this is this a fan cable where
right here this red and red black and
white twisty guy yeah let's do there all
right that looks horrible yeah
huh we have how many is that three three
three memory sticks
wow this hurt this power supply actually
goes beyond the ketchup and mustard and
has a clear business and has a clear
like the clear plastic connector which
is just just reeks of aid of a very
cheap power supply also just the
completely closed in housing with a
little little finger where all the where
all the cables come out you know that's
good this case the system also looks
like it's on the ground I don't I always
computer off floor that's what I always
demand it'll last situation yeah all
right so I new power supply new case the
case is passable actually new platform I
mean that core platform is really what
you should be investing in right now
this is getting to be pretty pretty
agent yeah and yeah I mean if the the
thing that's just standing out the most
over everything is that power supply
with the closed second being the fan
cable that's that's draped over here
with the twist eNOS and the extra colors
and the mismatched RAM mismatched RAM
yeah I mean if you're being practical
and the power supply is functional no
upgrade your power supply your
motherboard and your processor and your
memory save it for that everything else
is you can work with yeah otherwise that
power supply is gonna be shooting flames
out the back before you know it
so get on that we dboy thank you for the

be quiet dark rock 3 cooler the zotac
you textin 60 amp of course there are
MXM 50 powers plot fractal defined c
tempered glass some dynamic GB 12th fans
and a silent wings in there alright what
is happening here so what is what is
happening like so for starters the front
fans one is set to intake and the other
set to exhaust your right Kyle
weird that is you don't see that area
strange so I would perhaps not the best
of a scheme for airflow for your air
flow I would flip the white fan and I
mean I went to intake as well maybe he
did a bunch of tests maybe he took all
of his fans flipped them different
directions like in all the different
combinations they could be in and
decided that this was actually the best
cooling performance if you did that then
leave them how they are if not then flip
your your top fans Benante can imagine
all right now also the cooler the cooler
if it's know if it's vertical is not
horrible but there's no top exhaust for
here right this is gonna mesh up on the
top on this case alright and then fancy
doesn't have MIT or maybe he's got the
panels is those panels yes the mod you
vets the weird thing is that the modern
covers are installed
otherwise you'll be able to see like the
light for dogs so if you're gonna keep
your cooler in that orientation
bark-bark-bark and I've tested I've
tested thermals inside of I don't know
fine
that have the mod you vent cutters enter
and slightly turned down the volume okay
I turned it back up
please continue found I'm gonna make
sure that nothing removing the the Naja
vent covers oh boy
removing the mod you meant covers of
this case can dramatically reduce your
thermals your temperatures so especially
if you have your cooler pointed up where
you're trying to exhaust hot air out the
top your case then pop one or two or
maybe all of those panels off if noise
isn't a concern that's a pretty quite
cool I'm sure it wouldn't be or flip
your cooler 90 degrees counterclockwise
and have the air aimed at the rear fan
to aid in exhaust that's what I would
recommend power supply cable extensions
would be a solid here I mean at least
they're black no ketchup and mustard but
still they don't look the prettiest yeah
EVG a lot of the EVGA power supplies
have this and it's starting Johnny like
this drink the second follow-up to the
the ketchup and mustard like the big old
fat heat shrink that goes over whatever
the heck is in the middle of the cable
right there it's standing out in this
but I mean your color schemes on point
at least right yeah that's good very
much very color neutral black and white
it looks great but somebody asked
somebody are you replied and pointed out
despatched and taking exact the only
ones
alright thanks Kai Thank You Kai next up

terabyte hard drive CD and DVD Drive G's
still tried on Zr to be memory I go RGB
120 fans I do not is there any SSD in
this
it does not appear so all right that's
the problem all right
you know this system could really use an
SSD I feel like it's got some pretty
high quality componentry going on
including like RGB memory SSD oh my gosh
yeah you're missing out on so much you
so much responsiveness from the system
without having that sisty that said huh
all right so we got some LEDs so you
know some some lights going on and stuff
maybe this is it's like a it's it's like
it's like an industrial sort of but with
the lights going it yeah going on I
don't know it's industrial but pretty
yeah yeah we're trying to be pretty yeah
it's got RGB with the with the treaded z
memory and and the LED strip I think
that's a strip um but you know obviously
the nock to a fan that you have in your
cooler is very high performing but isn't
really gonna match jack you might
consider you could probably you know
sell that for a decent you know a few
bucks and maybe swap it just was one of
their crow max ones or one of their
industrial ones that would match a lot
better care management there's a lot of
cables going on so turn to fault you too
much for that cuz they're going where
they need to go but there's there's
definitely a bit of whatever this is in
the middle here it's tied up out in
front where does it seem necessary right
right in front of this little bunch yeah
yeah that's for the optical drive it's
nothing a lot for me there and then I
would say flip your power supply cuz it
looks like your Kate this is look case
this is a practical case no that's
thermal think what it's the suppressor
35 shocker that you would confuse a
thermal take Kate yeah but I do believe
there is a dust filter there at the
bottom so um you would you would benefit
from that yeah that's very suggestion 'z
yes all it said but before you worry
about any of the aesthetics you get an
SSD and get off the floor
really good it's on the floor get off
the floor maybe it was just moved to the
floor for the pictures I hope so
no probably it's not plugged in on not
close but you have the floor not floor

watching this show right now who's gonna
probably not you never know
this doesn't come up too much unfit my
pc but the fingerprints on your tempered
glass side panel would drive the little
bit of OCD I have here up the wall yeah
yeah I give that little wipe down well
why don't it's being exaggerated because
it's catching the flash right there so
true but yeah it's busted it's standing
out um very solid strong theme here with
the black and red you've got a splash of
green as well with the air fan so sure
whatever floats your boat
I think that color combo I can't tell
for sure but the two pictures with the
fans and these are obviously digital
fans because he's got the the NZXT fans
he's setting these two blue to red and
green so I think that's his intent here
yes here's my question
why is your keyboard which I can see a
reflection of blue and purple this
should also be writing green I want this
to be a Christmas themed PC now yeah and
that's kind of what I want to go for it
purple has no place in Christmas land to
fill out the Christmas theme I feel like
you should get a little mini Christmas
tree put it right here in the front of
the case when you get those replacement
LEDs from NZXT to replace the broken
strip you can also do like a little
wrapping around there
I think that would be really cool yeah
and then you made the Christmas PC
that's what you should do indeed and
maybe upgrade your cooler one day
because the hyper 212 is as great of a
bargain as it is is starting to look a
bit dated with that with that heat sink
and that glossy black plastic fan yeah
why it's not standing out quite as much
to me um there are some loose cables in
here let's go but let's get back to our
roots with it with my PC we got some
loose cables just hanging about in here
those can be tidied up a bit too so yeah
there's there's there's as you can see
there's cutouts I mean you already are
aware of the cutouts for your behind
your SSDs behind your hue plus and your
SSD there's those cable cutouts I would
route your USB 3 through through one of
those cutouts as well where as opposed
to how you have it now kind of
stretching all the way across that
reservoir bar but looks good overall
looks great Thank You Izzy thanks Izzy
and thanks everybody my place Lee
pictures we'll do this again soon so
don't be discouraged I had a lovely time
and also if if you've submitted your PC
like three or four times in a row and
I'm still not picking it it's probably
because your systems good enough there's
really not much Justin sucks it's not
good enough it's because I hate you as a
person
it's very personal basically yeah so
don't get offended don't be like Oh Kyle
hates me it's probably just because
there's really not much for us to
comment on and so I just keep skipping
past it every week so just want to put
that out but thanking everyone who
submitted and we'll catch you guys next
week
I'm news let's talk about some news
circling back to new egg here we sort of
briefly mentioned them earlier but this
isn't an actual news bit at Newegg about
new egg changing the review system to to
basically aggregate reviews across
multiple processors a large egg logo
this III initially found out about this
through WCC F Tech Keith our buddy in
Powell and Twitter actually did a video
I I could be wrong here but then I feel
like they have been doing this for a
long time like this is not new really
maybe if not
I know Amazon Amazon at least has been
doing this for a long time
Amazon hi yes okay short but I feel like
I feel like when Amazon does it I'll
take a read
I feel like Amazon does it to a degree
but you know like you'll see a mixed
variety of product reviews you know
different products or reviews for
different products for you know on a
single product page but they're not like
drastically different it might be for
like a different like if it's a battery
pack it might be the exact same model
and everything but just a different
milliamp rating or a different color you
know they're pretty similar but from
what it looks like here new egg is sort
of aggregating reviews for just all
types of different products especially
for motherboards that have completely
different price ranges are different
prices and feature sets you can see here
you got the Z Z 370 gaming 7 all the way
down to you know Z 370 HD 3 which is
which is a significantly lower end board
but yet they're combining the reviews
for all of these products and feeding
them to the patoot to a product page for
one single product without without it
being super clear that they're doing so
and so what you find is that even in the
sidebar here you can see it says
terrific 5 out of 5 eggs terrific
motherboard at a great price
so people who are visiting this page
think oh wow people really love this
board but you find out later that that's
actually a review for a different model
board that's about a hundred dollars
cheaper and this continues even within
the review tab if you go to the review
tab on new you can try to test it out
right now you could look up a board or
whatever on new egg and see for yourself
all the reviews are now combined for you
know for example a chipset is this is
the example that we're looking at here
which can be very misleading I could see
how this would be misleading to people
who aren't aware of this change on the
site or who just aren't very experienced
PC builders and as the article is saying
PC building trying to like knowing which
parts are compatible
is hard enough that's that's like a huge
challenge for a lot of first-time
builders and this kind of makes them a
bit more confusing for those people I
think when they're trying to figure out
wait are these the is this the board
that I'm actually reading reviews for so
I think it's a little bit misleading
whether they intended it to be or not I
mean obviously they didn't intend it to
be but I think the reason why Newegg is
doing this is to create the illusion
that they have a flourishing review
reviewer community like Amazon ah I
think that's what it is because now all
of a sudden because no they definitely
weren't doing this before never before
have I seen a motherboard on Newegg with
700 plus reviews but doesn't happen to
notice that all of these asrock
motherboards have the same gem 42
reviews right hmm very peculiar on those
this one does so and then so and you
realize they all have a 4 out of 5
rating all the MSI boards have 362
reviews yes and that's what's even more
concerning is that the a grading the
grading that was such a huge fundamental
part of the new a reviewer system is now
compromised because you're getting the
review rating the a grading of a
smorgasbord of different products rather
than just the one you're looking at all
the Asus boards has certain 36 reviews
which makes every board on the site look
amazing all these products oh my god
they're all so well reviewed when in
reality that's not the case and pretty
stupid
it's I feel like they're shooting
themselves in the foot it's a in case
you guys weren't aware and this is this
is a pass that there's no like legal
reason for this but Kylie I both used to
work for Newegg and I back when we
worked there knew of people who very
ardently defended the Newegg review
system because they realized that if you
allow compromised if you allow a vendor
to come in and say like hey this product
has a bad review how about you just
change that or something like then it's
worthless the review system is worthless
so this is obviously you know we haven't
been there for years I
who the heck ins in charge of this now
but they've obviously made the decision
decision that we would like to make our
review system worthless you know yeah
great job
it's very informed that call yeah you
really have to dig now for reviews on a
specific product
they're not just there on the product
page they're jumbled up with a bunch of
a bunch of reviews for other products I
do think there that you can search
reviews so at least that's an option so
maybe if you are looking for a review on
a specific product you can take the the
products like model number how do you do
that put it into the search I've never
done that before
well done nothing for this beer let me
see if I can do it reviews all right so
let's look at this awesome as that's how
many reviews that's that's those are
reviews for all your products those are
all the products that you're getting
reviews for 742 reviews mm-hmm and even
says review of asrock extreme for right
here dead on arrival awesome it'll say
at the bottom and that's not even 0 to
70 Pro for related product ah at least
they're tagged related products so how
do you like filter out there at the top
here uncheck all related product reviews
ha now there's 184 reviews right and I
think it's got a better rating it's good
damn it
yeah totally better yeah I mean I'm sure
this depend if T much the word you're
looking for sure alright well that's how
you get around it guys we've discovered
this but if you've heard here first so
just let it's stupid but it's stupid
because it presents you with a different
thing and you've got to go in here and
check some other my suggestion would be
just to leave it unchecked by default
Newegg you have it unchecked
give them the option to check in don't
give them the option to uncheck it leave
it unchecked by default yeah and here's
where you would search by the way to and
can search them there so I don't know
it's confusing it's confusing not really
for like me or Paul but for like new new
people I feel it could be bad I don't
know for people who aren't doing the
taking a few extra steps to investigate
further
they might get a they might be misled in
their impression of the product and how
many reviews it has and how many people
have actually bought that product used
it and then thought enough about it in
one way or another to go online and
poster review but I know it's really
weird as it was like literally last week
when I was on Amazon I had Amazon and
Newegg open looking at the same product
and there were tons of reviews on that
product for on Amazon but maybe only
like two or three undoing and I was like
wow the review community is really good
no and I literally thought that last
week and then this happens so they knew
egg clearly has been seeing the same
things seeing the same issue I've been
trying to rectify it in one way or
another so let's move on though all
right the UH this is an article from
tweak town our good friend Anthony wrote
this one up
hi Anthony if you're watching GTX the
gtx 1180
will sample june 15th according to
rumors from tom's hardware
good to know and yeah holy crap it's
it's coming this is gonna be like tweets
like purple now they made it purple no
Paul that's this just the lighting and
that's at a yeah yeah nevermind good
stuff getting my hopes up throughout for
a purple founders edition card but this
will be a batters Edition card dream cap
we can don't let them be dreamers Nitra
June 15 the GTX 1180 founders Edition
will allegedly launch and it's going to
top the performance of the current
flagship Nvidia card the Titan X little
P which is very exciting
this is launching apparently the week of
coputex which is kind of interesting
it's it's gonna be a show stealer for
sure if that's the case and will also
mean that Paul and I might have to stop
by the Nvidia booth just to see if that
sampling June 15th right book launching
august september
well august september for admin board
partners the founders edition card will
launch several months before that well
launch june 15th that's what it made it
that's theoretical made it seem like
that would actually be III not Computex
I believe June 15th
yeah okay that makes sense yeah cuz June
it's the first week of June is Computex
so that could be something that they may
be announced at the e3 yeah you show you
three is June 12th said June 14th I
wouldn't be surprised if okay June 14
okay
so shortly after at any rates June 15th
we should have many more details about
this typed up card cool and we don't
know what the price is yet the tight
next little P is around $1,200 right now
and this card maybe I can't imagine it
being that much so maybe around a
thousand nine hundred to a thousand it
would be my guess
if this is just the this is just the
1180 the successor to the 1080 and
they're not pretending like the graphics
card pricing bubble is something that
they're like I don't know I I it's hard
to tell for sure what's gonna happen in
the next month or the next few months
but like I feel like the manufacturers
themselves aren't suddenly setting MSRP
s in relation to like the increased
demand and and overpriced stuff that's
been happening so yeah I feel like this
should still be a alright probably a
$600 card when they launch it and then
they'll drop the price when the 1180 TI
comes out to 550 or 500 in the 1180 I'd
be 650 or 700 or maybe that jumps by
fifty or hundred bucks this round
because of the increased prices because
of you know things get more expensive
every year you know the $6.00 burger the
Carl's jr. now costs like six dollars
and fifty cents or something like that
well now the name is accurate no it's
not accurate it costs more than six
dollars that's false advertising this is
called the six dollar burger yeah
they're just rounding down when the
sixth our burger came out it was like it
was supposed to be a joke no it's four
bucks it 399 and they came out with it
cuz I don't go to like Red Robin or TGI
Fridays or wherever and pay 6 bucks for
a burger you can get that same quality
burger for four dollars and you don't
pay six dollars and that's why it's
called the six dollar burger right but
now it actually costs more than $6 might
say yeah they should rename it to the
eight
they should or something come on I don't
know Carlos mercy didn't get on that
shins seems like garbage boy cutting
Carl's to you exactly so um yeah alright
I guess we'll have to wait for more
details to come to come to light but I
wouldn't expect this card to be very
cheap and you know I think NVIDIA is
probably kind of glad in the sense that
they don't have to be the ones answering
to consumers as to why the prices are so
high they can set a pretty attractive
MSRP and then be like well frickin
Newegg and Amazon are the ones who are
marking up the prices they're the ones
who are selling it for twice the MSRP we
this is our suggested price this is what
we want it to sell it for but now I'm
sure they don't mind being in that
situation at all so we'll just have to
see how it plays out
but let's move on it's articles from
guru about Asus and and their
confirmation that there Ares branding is
here to stay the Ares line of AMD GPUs
that was sort of spawned because as a
response to the GP P the GeForce
partners program which is now absolved
and or not it's all dissolved dissolved
dissolved and no longer a thing a lot of
people were speculating that Ares would
go away along with it due to a tweet
that came out from a supposed Ares
Twitter profile that ended up being fake
so the fake profile that was posing as a
sustain well this is were gone there's
no more areas sorry Ares is no more and
then and then a bunch of interesting
like kid guru themselves and a lot of
other very credible and reputable you
know um journalists and stuff were
reporting on this saying that Ares was
was gone it was going away but it turned
out to be a fake account that kind of
duped everyone huh and Asus eventually
confirmed that Ares is here to stay
so um so that's I don't know that's
that's what's up with that do you have
an opinion either way on Ares were you
looking forward to an Ares branded card
Paul or is like
I feel like it's a little bit more
exciting now that it's not something
that Asus has to do because of GPP it's
now something that they have fun I
really feel like they're sticking with
it because even even though Nvidia
rolled it back and was like alright guys
we're not gonna do that
I feel like Asus is like no this is that
wasn't because because Asus never said
nothing directly and they never made a
public statement you know as a result of
GBP we're creating the area's brand it
was always assumed you know and it's
pretty I'm fairly confident that that's
why it's happened sure but I feel like
cases it just me like no it's what we
wanted to do the whole time I mean this
was intended yeah you keep doing it I
don't know I have mixed feelings I I
don't think it's like it's all the same
cards - it's just the same exact designs
of the ROG cards it's just like called
Aries instead of ROG so yeah yeah I
don't know I I'm fine with ROG I don't
think there needs to be more and more
sub brands for different companies
because I think it's right it's it's
more confusing yeah you know if a card
is listed with an AMD radeon GPU then
you know has an AMD radeon GPU even if
it's an ACO Sergi card yeah I don't know
it you know in part of me like I think
it's kind of a twofer for asus and in
one regard they're like well you know if
we just carry on with ares then people
just assume that we weren't involved
with GPP and it won't be so obvious that
we were doing this just because of GPP
on the second hand I feel like they've
probably already dumped a ton of
money into branding this yeah they're
invested at this point it'd be a huge
loss if they just backed out all of a
sudden right let's get rid of
all the ares it's also stickers and then
ares tags or whatever all the packaging
all that for thousands and
thousands of cards so yeah it's a 2 for
free suits in the sense I would I would
have to think but yeah that's that's
what's going on there and then our final
story here of the day or at least for
this half of the show is from
overclocked 3d dotnet reporting on EVGA
x' plans to no longer use DVDs for their
driver
in place of USB sticks this is actually
our good buddy old pal Jacob from EVGA
who tweeted out that no more driver DVDs
in future EVGA motherboards we love
Jacob he's a good guy
yes and he's never steered me wrong he's
never lied to me so I would have to
assume that his tweet is accurate and
and precise he also mentioned that USB
the USB drives would cost 20 times more
than DVDs with the same files on them 20
times more and because of that he and I
quote doubts that other manufacturers
will switch to USB drives any time soon
saying that it's about time someone sets
the standard for 2018 so there are other
manufacturers who do this to some degree
asus does do USB stick drivers with some
of their higher end higher-end ROG
motherboards I think you also get a disc
along with it I didn't your USB Drive
with my rampage 6 extreme hey you did I
did yeah I must have missed it pretty
sure what did it look like
I think the zenith and yeah it's it's
like a little orgy
well I'm missing out on a free USB
Drive often looking at them but they're
saying they're doing this with all their
motherboards
which is like a statement to make and a
cool thing that you can say across the
board
whereas Asus has a ton of like budget
motherboards where they cut every corner
possible to sell a board a really great
competitive price and they're not gonna
want to do this with that right so yeah
and yeah I mean how many systems
honestly have optical media these days
here's where you should click through to
that's weak that article but oh my god
there's an ad that plays before I can
see the picture
that's sweet week town come on you don't
have you don't have you block going all
right wait I don't
oh wait is that it right there this
thing no that's it's just a little USB
stick it's it's probably one of these
done here oh my god tweet Tim oh wait
here we go
oh no not that see oh there it is oh
jeez my screen is touch screens list oh
yeah we clicked on something first time
it didn't so that's just tweaked M being
crazy okay fine um cool EVGA good on you
for setting some trends I hope other
manufacturers follow and then it won't
raise our motherboard prices by 20 times
I agree okay you need to pull up your
super chat you want your donations do
not believe cells you're at today oh
okay all right let me get around to that
it's just in the meantime here I'm going
to start telling us some Johnston's cuz
I've gotten a few orders Johnson that
 a few orders have come through
actually two orders to be more if you
were a specific first ones our guests
Johnson tiga Thank You Gus from Missouri
goose he got the desk mat it's a big ol
long one
Kyle's using that right now it's doing a
great job it's very long tracking the
night movement and Rex Rex T from Cali
right here in Cali got the Pug last set
the single pup last I should say and the
Star Wars black t-shirt the awesome
hardware shirt if we didn't mention it
before if you buy awesome hardware merch
from either of our stores the proceeds
are still split between us so John
arranges that for us cuz he's awesome
and we do that so you guys don't have to
feel conflicted
to store you back word it's very
thoughtful of us weird I you're welcome
I also have two orders one for Kevin
Kevin
you bought Jobson Kevin Johnson to you
for picking up in evolution gaming desk
and Johnson for Gus double Johnson
Billie words in a circle pint glass
thank you very much sure and I do have
super chat pulled up here so let's read
off some of your do nations those Inga X
Kyle what do you think of your ROG
rampage six extreme motherboard that we
were just talking about thinking about
getting one but want to see how you like
the one you got I spent probably two
months actually using mine on a daily
basis and it's been perfectly fine I'm
able to hit a decent overclock on my 78
9 B or a 79 80 XE and it's been stable
it's been rock solid and especially if
you're gonna take advantage of some of
those higher end features like the
dimmed 2 slot want double + BM e drives
on there it's it's great it's a great
board he did - oh it's also visiting
ganks so be sure to read this one next
I was just if you want to group them I
thought oh yeah sure I be it ex also
said the to married men saying they do
not have $2,000 laying around go figure
is that is that is that our wives are
spending all over money or my wife makes
money to my wife that makes money that
from our company but she still works for
it so I don't know that means I'm not
sure if you're saying our wives are
somehow gold diggers or something that's
not true actually when I first met wifey
sauce when we first started dating she
had a job and I did not and she paid for
literally everything I was the gold
digger I was the gold I was just digging
there was it's really that's why I did
it was for her money
he ain't messing with no broke girl's
house broke wifey's I ain't messing with
no broke wife he's that's that's that's
my cringe comfort like cringe pump
contribution for the day let's move on
mb 67 for a 30 no and 37 cents as usual
Kyle what do you look forward to seeing
the most at Computex
man um geez I don't know man it's so
hard to find innovation these days I'm
just looking for something that's
different probably looking forward to
seeing like a tray of Xiao long bao at
didn't iPhones in probably yes probably
oh my god I cannot wait for the food in
Taipei oh but as far as you know I want
to see some cool cases I really like
checking out cases I want to see some
cases with USB type-c on the front that
have good smart anterior layouts that
are no frills but just all function that
still look good and yeah I mean what
else are we lacking right now I feel
like cases is a big one half priced
memory just just freeze three memory
there's a new line of memory it's six
richer is that it costs half as much as
memory now we called the deal Wow
awesome Buddha knows right through
buh-buh-buh-buh deem at 8:12 sorry for
calling you Buddha hey Kyle would you
ever have barnacle ease on stack attack
or maybe Jays two cents uh yes I would
consider almost anyone even if they
weren't trustworthy or had any talents
so Jay and Barna Cleese are definitely
considerations and you know you never
know I already had call on and that was
fun
[Laughter]
fun you know yeah that's a good good
burrito it was a good burrito yes it was
yeah they did deliver quite literally
but yeah you know special guests are
definitely something that we're we're
trying to push and yeah you know I can't
I can't just keep beatin poor wifey
sauce left and right you know if you
should I need some sort of a challenge
don't don't take that out of context in
the game doing better than her world and
stone okay important just so we'll see
we'll see that we have our next straw
hat I will tell you right now next Agra
Tech will not be Wi-Fi sauce it'll be
someone else
straw hat brought you two dollars solve
the freezing problem the freezing that's
all that must have been back when the
camera the camera froze a couple times
yeah that was like so last 30 minutes
again and then just say to dollar
donation how do I show a rig I built for
my brother how do you show a rig so if
you want to get a rig on pin my PC you
really need to follow mainly Kyle
because he never use them and he'll
usually tweets on Tuesday before awesome
Hardware between one and one in four
hours before the show usually yeah
sometimes earlier than that but you just
gotta kind of watch yeah cuz when he
tweets is when he's looking that's when
you got send your pictures you send it
before then or whatever like it might
show up yeah but um that's how you do it
yep
all right pup shepherd $10 wags wags
wags wags wags since you missed them
last time we miss your wags I always
miss your wax but I apologize pup but
your wags have been noticed senpai okay
Phoebe ciao Valerie he always donate ten
dollars very consistent what do you
recommend for a CPU and a mother bowl
and a ram combo under the $500 $1,000
maybe I'm a sitting on an ASUS Maximus
impact six who knew my dinner was going
to run off into the sunset you bring
like dinner back to me it was almost 34
for canine snack Jesus Christ why am i
didn't have to be so round
can you uh please tell my next mirror to
a cat so uh what do you recommend for a
CPU and motherboard Ram combo under $500
thousand dollars I'm sitting on an ASUS
Maximus impact six for the 4770k
it's still good I don't need to upgrade
but I would much I would very much like
one um so you have 4770k wait Animax was
impact six then those are both great
components
CPU motherboard and RAM combo I don't
know man you could either go risin risin
is really compelling at the moment or or
get an 87 third K those are your choices
right now so yeah I don't know I don't
think you probably you probably don't
need to spend all the money on high-end
desktop either way
87 or BK if like gaming's your priority
if you're gonna be doing like more
multitasking more I don't know like
multi-threaded applications are your
priority over gaming then looking to
rise into 2700 X would be pretty key
large dog trying to large doggie trying
to sniff your balls each other stuff
where I want to be and require five
Canadians hey guys what's the good
editing and thumbnail programs on the
cheap editing editing and thumbnail
programs just get creative cloud fifty
bucks a month very affordable I think
that's affordable for having the whole
suite of Adobe software I mean it's a
lot cheaper than it used to be having to
spend like fifteen hundred dollars yeah
single avid or whatever but if you're
really trying to like go super cheap
with it but yeah but if you don't want
to spend money if you're really on a
budget GIMP it's similar to photoshop
it's a bit of a learning curve I've I
never got into GIMP to the to where I
can use it the way I know Photoshop but
you can do a lot of the same stuff that
you can do with Photoshop and it's free
yes GIMP is a good one yeah
savage tech $2.00 what cooler would you
recommend for a sixty seven hundred K at
4.8 gigahertz at one point four seven
volts a cooler if you're looking for an
air cooler Noctua make some really good
coolers you'd probably want to go with a
beefier air cooler for an overclocked 67
30 K especially at that frequency or you
can get like a 240 millimeter a IO
there's plenty of good ones out there
some some brands from some good brands
that I've come across include ones from
Corsair deep cool even makes a pretty
good one there Captain anorak series I
know max NZXT Silverstone perhaps
options up there any choices so many
choices Rick Sanchez as soon as that DVR
drops I'm on a rising platform not the
GPUs but the memory that's docked me
yep yeah I feel you man we're right
there with you too much stay it's for
its forecast to stay woke to drop in
price and ya know if that's true or not
but fingers crest yeah okay that's it
for my half of the show yay
hell yeah thank you very much for tuning
in but don't go anywhere because Paul's
half is right around the corner that
will start streaming here in just a
couple minutes if you're watching a
slide go ahead and follow the link in
the description below of my youtube
