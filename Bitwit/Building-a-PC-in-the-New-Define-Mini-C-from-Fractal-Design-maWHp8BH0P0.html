channel today we're taking a look at a
brand new case from fractal design this
is their define mini C and if you're
watching this video on the day of upload
it has just launched today and it's a
micro ATX case which is kind of exciting
because it's been a while since fractal
released a chassis in this form factor I
think the last one we saw was the define
mini which actually looked a lot like
this one in fact this case looks very
similar to all the other recent fractal
cases we've seen like the defined s to
define nano s kind of has that same
Scandinavian minimalistic design however
once we take a look at the internal
layout we'll see that there have been
some drastic improvements made that the
other cases do not currently have so
that's going to be pretty exciting as
well so taking a look Oh first off I
should mention MSRP $80 on this bad boy
80 bucks
not too shabby very competitively priced
that's for the windowed version it does
come in a non windowed version as well
for five dollars less so you could save
some money there if you don't care about
seeing your innards and showing off your
handiwork now with that said take a look
at the front of the case here you do get
that same faux brushed aluminum finish
that we're used to seeing on these
fractal cases however it is a plastic
construction on the front panel and even
though it does have this very nice
closed off look you still get ample
ventilation on both sides of the chassis
so you do get fresh intake going to the
rest of your components inside which is
also nice to see now if you pop off the
front panel you do get a removable dust
filter along with some mounting options
which I will get to in a bit moving on
to the top you've got your front panel
IO which includes mic and headphone
jacks power and reset along with two USB
3.0 ports just behind that you get a
single module bed cover we've seen these
before from fractal it's got some sound
dampening material on the underbelly if
you want to tailor your system for for
silence for example however you can
remove it there's some internal latches
that allow you to pop the panel out very
easily and that'll actually open up the
case for more airflow if you wanted to
slap a couple 120 millimeter fans on
there you can slap up to two of them or
if you wanted to install a 280 mm I'm
sorry 240 millimeter radiator you can do
so however you want to make sure that
your RAM is no taller than 40
millimeters that's from the motherboard
to the top of your memory module
otherwise you could run into some
interference issues with that radiator
at the rear of the case you will find
one of fractals new dynamic x2 GP 12 120
millimeter fans with these white blades
I would assume there's also been some
kind of improving
the bearings or airflow and things like
that this is one of two included fans
you'll find in the define mini sea
there's also one at the front intake of
the chassis but this one on the back is
actually positioned on these flexible
mounting strips which allow you to move
the fan up or down preferably down if
you want to open up some clearance for a
top radiator potentially now just
beneath the exhaust fan you'll find five
expansion slots and this is kind of the
beautiful thing about the micro ATX form
factor is that you kind of hit this
sweet spot between a mini ITX build
which is super compact and portable but
not very feature filled you can't do a
dual GPU setup for example and a full
Tower ATX chassis where you have all the
features you can do you know four-way
SLI four-way crossfire if you wanted to
however you're dealing with a lot more
real estate that you're taking up on
your space so for users who don't really
have all that space in their rooms on
their desks but still want to run maybe
a multi GPU setup or even just a couple
different PCIe cards in their
motherboard this might be a good option
is going with a micro ATX case like this
so five expansion slots gives you plenty
of functionality without sacrificing too
much in in real estate now towards the
bottom of the case you get this power
supply bracket which you can remove with
these two captive thumb screws speaking
of which both of the side panels also
include captive thumb screws so that's
very much appreciated but to install the
power supply you simply remove that
bracket screw it on to whatever unit
you're going to install and simply slide
it back into the rear of the chassis
before remounting those thumb screws
super simple you also get a power supply
dust filter which spans the entire
length of the chassis because there is
an optional 120 millimeter fan mount at
the front floor of the case as well so
you're going to want ample coverage for
a dust filter to cover both that
optional fan mount as well as your power
supply assuming that you're installing
the unit with the fan face downward on
top of that the the filter is accessible
from the front of the case simply
because it's just kind of a pain
sometimes when you want to clean that
out to have to reach around to the back
your chassis much more convenient to
have it at the front in my opinion
taking a quick look at the bottom here
you get four of these shiny plastic feet
with the rubber pads at the very bottom
as to not scuff up the surface of your
desk and to also keep your system from
slipping and sliding around as far as
the side panels go I already mentioned
the captive thumb screws which is very
much appreciated you'll
get a fairly large side panel window
here on the main side of your system
which is kind of a plasticy acrylic
plexi material whatever you want to call
it it's not tempered glass it's the
typical plexi that we're used to so it
is fairly prone to fingerprints and
especially scratches so I would make
sure to leave on that plastic wrap that
plastic packaging until you're
completely done with your system just to
avoid any kind of accidental scratches
essentially do the opposite of what I
just did here there is no sound
dampening material on this side panel
simply because the window itself takes
up most of the real estate on the panel
it would be kind of pointless to even
include just a little sliver of
dampening material anywhere here however
on the other side panel that's pretty
much all you get is just sound dampening
material across the entire thing to
again reduce noise and vibration and
optimize the chassis for silent
operation so I think on that note that
pretty much covers all the external
features of the chassis why don't we go
ahead work our way inwards now I'm going
to take the side panels off and we're
going to start installing all of this
Hardware I'm going to go I'm not going
to say what all this stuff is until I'm
actually ready to install it we'll just
call it out as we go and we'll take it
from there
should be good let's do it neck all
right so we've got the main side panel
off now and it's time to install the
motherboard I've already prepped the
motherboard installed the CPU memory and
cooler and all that jazz so we're just
going to go ahead and start installing
these standoffs they are not
pre-installed
however fractal does give you one one
bonus when bonus stand up in the middle
to kind of get yourself oriented which
is thoughtful what I'd like to see
pre-installed standoffs just to cut down
some of the installation time but what
can you do you guys can probably see the
generous CPU cooler cut out here which
is very nice as well as plenty of
grommeted holes for for routing your
cables through you got two up here
preferably for your 8 pin EPS for your
CPU may be like radiator fans things
like that and two very large cutouts on
the side here for your 24 pin ATX USB
three whatnot there's also a couple
other cutouts at the bottom of the
chassis which we'll take a look at in
just a moment and drop in our
motherboard like so and you guys are
probably wondering what trick and
motherboard is this we're actually using
an older platform for today's test build
the
cuz turns out the only micro ATX board I
had on hand that was available was a Z Z
170 or Z 77 board so you can see we're a
couple generations old here rocking that
Ivy Bridge lifestyle we've got a 35 70 K
Core i5 in here which I actually take
from my htpc I'm not sure if you guys
caught that from my Instagram post but
wifey sauce was not too happy when she
found out that the htpc was not in order
additionally we've got 8 gigs of some a
data memory that's just some budget
economical kit that I've had for a while
along with a very new NZXT cooler this
is the kraken x 50 to 240 millimeter but
it would be a nice way to test out the
radiator support in the define mini s
here are the started to define mini c
and wha-la
while we're at it why don't we go ahead
and pop out the mod you vent cover while
we're here just to open up a little bit
more airflow and I just wanted to point
out that the radiator support at the top
as well as at the front of the case does
feature the same kind of flexible
mounting strips that we saw on the rear
exhaust fan so if you wanted to kind of
slip and slide the radiator
whichever way you wanted to gives you a
little bit of flexibility there speaking
of which we are going to finish
installing this ki yo I'm going to go
ahead and position the radiator at the
front of the case I think it'll look
pretty nice right there
now really quick we're going to pause
for a second on the radiator
installation here to show you one of the
newest additions to the defined family
of chancy's which is a power supply
shroud many of you guys are familiar
with these you've seen them on plenty of
chassé ease in the past and I think
we've been waiting for fractal to
implement one of these for a long time
now so it's nice to see that they
finally have if you're unfamiliar with
power supply shrouds it's basically a
compartment it compartmentalizes your
chassis into a separate unit for your
power supply itself as well as to stash
any excess unwanted cabling and keep
them out of sight for a cleaner more
tidy look overall in your system
additionally there's a hard drive cage
underneath here which we're going to get
to in a bit another thing I wanted to
point out is if there's a lot of
ventilation at the top portion here of
the shroud and that's just to allow for
some more airflow either for your power
supply if you were
to mount it with the fan facing upwards
or for a second graphics card if you
were to if you were doing two-way SLI or
crossfire your bottom card might be
start for airflow if there wasn't any
kind of ventilation on this shroud here
so that's a that's going to ensure some
cooler temperatures hopefully maybe
we'll do some testing on that in the
future now circling back to our radiator
installation here since we're dealing
with the 240 millimeter unit we are
pretty much good to go we can just slap
our fans in there we can even probably
have some room for push-pull in this
configuration which is really nice to
see however if we were to try installing
a 280 millimeter radiator you would have
to make some adjustments to the case to
get that to fit at the front here
including removing this front panel
there's a panel that's embedded into the
power supply shroud which you would have
to remove in order to open up some more
clearance for that 280 millimeter
radiator and also the hard drive cage at
the bottom underneath the shroud would
have to be positioned further back
towards the back of the case closer to
the power supply which can be done in
this chassis so you would have to do
that I'll show you guys how to do that
in just a bit but a couple modifications
there if you were to fit a radiator at
the front of your case that is of the
280 millimeter right and radiator
installation complete alright our supply
installation remove the bracket two
thumb screws very simple and we're going
to screw this on to the power supply
like so I already tried you cannot
install the power supply from the
backside of the case it has to be
through the rear and nothing else it
just simply doesn't have the clearance
which is fine I would have liked to see
the option for both but at least there's
still a viable solution that's pretty
easy so why don't we go ahead and get
this guy installed
alright alright the screws various
screws
then you shove all the cables in there
and yes pusher in that's an easy there
we go
just screw it down there you have it
alright so now that we're ready to
connect our front panel connectors to
our motherboard which includes things
like HD audio our power reset and things
like that you can see that there's
actually a couple cutouts there's three
cutouts there's one at the very rear
want the towards the middle where where
your USB 2.0 would presumably be on your
motherboard and one at the front here so
you get three cutouts
they aren't grommeted they're actually
too small to even be grommeted but they
are there so that you can easily route
your front panel connectors to your
motherboard very tightly and neatly
neatly and discreet be beautiful just
get off now taking a look at the
backside of the case here we can kind of
see what's going on underneath our power
supply shroud so of course we already
have the unit installed as well as our
hard drive cage now the hard drive cage
can support up to two and a half inch or
two three and a half inch drives if
you're going to be supporting the
lighter it does the trays come with
these rubber vibration vibration pads
for optimal silence and they are made of
metal so they're very sturdy I'm going
to go ahead and slop this in right there
right there and if the hard drive cage
looks a bit a bit loose to you right now
it's because it is there are four screws
that are holding in place at the bottom
of the case that I have already loosened
to show you just how flexible this cage
can be so this is the default position
that it comes in but if you wanted to
you could slide it all the way over and
pretty much hug the power supply unit as
close as you would want to before
interfering with the the actual cable
plugins and that's again to open up room
at the front of your case for a
lengthier 280 millimeter radiator and
you could do push-pull with a with with
the radiator that size as well you would
just have to perhaps use the fans
install the fans outside of your case
not necessarily outside but outside of
the mainframe underneath your front
panel the plastic front panel there so
you'd have one set of fans there and
another set of fans your
and then you could fit another set of
fans just before the hard drive cage
there now of course if you wanted to you
could remove this hard drive cage
entirely and have even more room for any
kind of radiator business at the front
there and you would still have
additional room at the bottom at the
very very floor of the chassis there is
a mounting point for a three and a half
inch drive and that does come with
rubber vibration pads as well so you're
not just installing it straight to the
floor of the metal chassis you actually
do get some some buffer there for or
reduced noise and vibration which is
really cool since our radiator is
already installed there's no other
alterations of this case we need to do
in order to install our hard drive so
we're going to go ahead and do that now
boom he has a really quick look at the
drive cage from the bottom of the case
again you can see that it can slide
pretty far off to the right to open up
clearance for that 280mm eater radiator
and you can kind of see the little
cutouts here for the rubber vibration
pads if you were to install a single
three-and-a-half inch drives at the
floor of the case and remove the cage
altogether
there we go now also at the back of the
case right behind the motherboard itself
actually overlapping the the generous
CPU cooler cutout you'll find your
dedicated SSD mount where you can fit
one two three three SSDs I believe
that's pretty generous actually it's got
the single thumb screw that holds it in
place you can remove it like so let's go
ahead and mount some SSDs to this bad
boy we're just going to mount one
actually in the middle and see how that
goes does come included with screws for
you to do that simply just align it and
screw it down
and boom now one thing to keep in mind
with this kind of SSD layout here is
that you're going to need a flat SATA
cable to connect it at least on this end
properly right angle say the cable in
this configuration will not work you can
probably get away with that with the
hard drive cage down there but not for
this kind of more flatter orientation
installing the graphics card in the
define mini C is quite straightforward
pretty much like most cases that you've
probably seen simply remove the PCI
slots which do have thumb screws go
ahead and slap the card in for our test
build we'll be using an unnecessary GT X
1080 founders Edition because we can
replace thumb screws now I should
mention here that you get three hundred
and fifteen millimeters of GPU clearance
length if you are going to be installing
a fan at the front of your case if
there's no fan at the front then you get
three hundred and thirty five
millimeters of GPU light length which is
probably more than any of us should ever
need as far as the i/o goes if you
aren't using an arrow and you're going
to be using just a standard CPU cooler
Tower
then you get a hundred and sixty eight
millimeters of height clearance with the
windowed version of the defined mini C
and 170 millimeters of clearance with
the non windowed version alright winding
down - pretty much the end of the road
here last thing we got to do is tidy up
these cables and talk about cable
management in this particular case and
so far just from looking at it before I
really even get started with everything
exploded all over the place I think this
is going to be pretty straightforward
and also pretty hassle-free because
we've got a lot of mounting options here
or routing options I should say there's
plenty of tie down points you get a four
of them right here below the SSD
actually there's three more right here
just but just a right next to the power
supply shroud and you've also got this
kind of like recessed area to the left
of the motherboard which you can really
tuck in a lot of cables especially with
the help of all these handy velcro
straps frightful design has included
three of them for you those work really
well from my past experience you've also
got plenty of room underneath the power
supply shroud itself between the hard
drive cage and the unit especially if
you were to remove the hard drive cage
entirely
then you would have even more room to
just stash extensions I don't know if
you wanted to actually integrate like a
water cooling pump down there you
probably could find some way to MacGyver
that there's tons of routing options
here so why don't we go ahead and start
tidying this up and see how we do and
voila there it is
cable management's all wrapped up in
about five to ten minutes of tidying
let's see how easily the side panel goes
on this is the wrong side panel this is
for the Nano s good lord where are you
Kyle come back to us here we are so pop
that on like so and holy smokes there's
like zero push back there's literally it
might as well be empty back there there
was zero push back completely screwed
down no problem sweet and I've also
connected the extensions on the other
side as well so that means we're pretty
much complete let's go ahead and pop the
the rest of our stuff back on here
including the dust filter still in focus
front panel tada there she is ladies and
gentlemen all built from the ground up
very straightforward although there was
one thing that I forgot to mention
earlier in the video and that is if you
are going to be removing that top mod
you vent cover fractal design has also
included this nifty magnetic dust filter
figure this lamp right there at the top
like so that way you get all nice and
clean doesn't get all overrun with dust
it's it's a match made in heaven let me
tell you so yeah when we go ahead and
cut back to a wide shot so you can see
my beautiful face I'll wrap things up
with some closing words and we'll end
this here video all right so as far as
my closing statements on the define mini
Sego honestly there's not too much to
complain about here it could be nitpicky
and say while I wish they'd
pre-installed the standoffs to make the
build process go a little bit quicker
but again it's an $80 case and for that
price point it's pretty much
unparalleled the term in terms of like
how much hardware you can fit in this
thing how much water
cooling support there is in terms of
radiators you won't really find that in
a micro ATX case at this price range
especially because the size I don't know
if I did a side-by-side comparison maybe
I'll jump to a b-roll shot right here
but this case the define mini seat isn't
that much larger than the defined Nano s
it's actually much closer to that size
of that Mini ITX case than it is to
something like the definer v or the
defined s which makes it even more
compelling if you're short on space desk
space room space at your place of usage
so that's that's also pretty pre pretty
cool now one thing to consider here if
you are going to be installing two
graphics cards if you're doing a dual
GPU setup is that your bottom card might
be a little bit starved for airflow
especially since the power supply shroud
here is where it is now I did mention
that there was some ventilation that
could help with that however after
installing a standard ATX power supply
I've noticed that it's actually pretty
much up to the brim of that ventilation
rendering it more or less useless to any
kind of video card that would be
directly above it so if you were going
to do SLI or crossfire for example in
this case I would suggest maybe opting
for an sfx power supply unit something a
little bit smaller to actually open up
that ventilation a bit more and then
making sure you have ample airflow going
to that part of your chassis by having
you know either a fan at the bottom
there or making sure that your radiator
your front radiator reaches all the way
to the bottom giving some fresh intake
to your graphics card there but apart
from that fractal design has done it
again with a small but powerful little
chassis here and I give them full marks
for water cooling support on a budget
especially in this form factor so that's
all for now guys let me know what you
think of this chassis here before you go
be sure to toss me a like on the video
if you enjoyed it and be sure to
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already as always I'm Kat a little bit
whit until I change my channel name
again thank you all for watching have a
great day and I will see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
