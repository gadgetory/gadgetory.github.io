something a little bit different today
as you all know it is now summertime
ambient temperatures are rising and you
might be thinking to yourself how do I
stay cooler how do I actually stay cool
and beat the heat this summer
not just your system but you yourself
admin temps are very important also so
what we're gonna be doing today is
trying to find a way to keep you guys
cool by DIY in our very own USB fan
not just any fan though we're gonna be
using a standard 12 volt PC case fan
like this one to conduct all of this
madness it should be a lot of fun and I
have a lot of spare fans to burn in case
this doesn't go well so I can't really
think of any other reasons why we're
doing this the inner Mac saber a full
Tower chassis features premium RGB sync
lighting included RGB strips and three
pre-installed twister bearing RGB fans
enjoy a tempered glass window power
supply shroud and extensive water
cooling support with two included front
panel options for prioritizing silence
or airflow compromise nothing with the
enter max a beret you can learn more by
clicking the link below I should also
mention that the items I picked to
complete this project were not picked
with a budget in mind so this is
definitely gonna be more expensive than
your typical USB fan that you can buy on
Amazon but you can always tweak the
items that I picked here to kind of
align with your budget if you really
want to shave things down and you can
find links to all this stuff in the
description let's quickly go over all
the parts that we're using starting with
the fan of course this is just a typical
200 millimeter RGB fan yes it has RGB
this is actually pulled from the H 500 P
mesh so that case is now missing a fan
you can see here we've got our three pin
fan connector as well as our four pin
RGB connector I was thinking that we
would just plug this all in once it's
all said and done into a laptop so I
don't I don't think we're gonna be able
to utilize the RGB element of this fan
which is quite sad but who knows so this
is a 200 millimeter fan but you can
really go with any size fan you want
doesn't matter if it's 80 millimetres
120 140 it's your personal preference
and all I'd say most PC case fans are of
the 12 volt variety
however USB as most you guys know is
rocking 5 volts so what would happen if
you actually stripped this wire and your
fan wire and
and merged them together you started
them together the fan would still
technically spin up but it would spin at
a much lower rpm than what it's rated
for simply because it's not getting
enough juice which would equate to a
lackluster fan experience you wouldn't
get quite the airflow you're looking for
and it wouldn't be very worthwhile in
the end so we have a way around this
though I actually picked up a set of
four of these step-up boosters on Amazon
for about 10 bucks for all four so it's
fairly cheap what this essentially does
is it converts say a five volt input it
even has micro USB input so we don't
even have to solder the wire here for
the micro USB it converts a five volt
input to pretty much any volt output up
to I think 28 volts for this particular
unit here there's an adjustable knob for
voltage and we can essentially keep
turning that knob and testing the output
voltage with a multimeter for example
until it reads 12 volts that way we know
that the USB is now giving us 12 volts
of power and that our fan will will
actually spin at its proper rpm at full
speed now with that said we'll obviously
need a soldering iron like this one
pretty simple I think I got this on
Amazon for around 20 bucks or so we're
gonna have to solder of course the fan
cable to the step-up converter so this
will help us do that with a tube of some
basic solder and I have a wet sponge on
hand so I can sort of deoxidize the tip
of the soldering iron and also keep it
clean while it's in use final items
you'll need include electrical tape so
that you can mask off any of the handy
work that you've done once you're
finished with the step-up converter and
then a wire cutter and stripper not that
kind of stripper this is just a wire
cutter I don't have a stripper on hand
so we're just gonna be using this for
both and last but certainly not least
we'll need something to mount our fan to
because obviously you could just stand
the fan up on your desk or whatever but
it's not the most stable and
just it's here we have a tablet stand
this actually fits I believe 7 to 13
inch tablets and I already do the
measurements and our 200 millimeter fan
will fit no problem you want to make
sure that whatever tablets stand you're
buying can fit obviously whatever size
fan you're opting for and you can really
choose any style of tablet stand as well
this one just kind of sits on your desk
and articulates a little a few ways but
there's also the tablet stands that can
clamp to the edge of your desk that have
like a three foot long bendy arm so
really the choice is up to you it's a
personal preference thing we're gonna go
with something a little bit more simple
today so those are all the things those
I think there's like about 10 items here
that we're using to finish the job and
again you can find links to all this
stuff in the video description but I
think on that note we're pretty much
ready to go
so I guess I'll start with step one what
is what is step one I've never done this
before
alright so the first step I want to take
here is to calibrate our little step-up
converter you can see I've actually
already plugged it in with the USB and
the u.s. the other end is plugged into a
laptop here so we're getting constant
power and then I have the multimeter
hooked up to the endpoints the the
output points right here and then you
can see we have a voltage readout of 17
around 17 volts at the moment I'm gonna
go ahead and turn this knob as I turn it
looks like we're going down in voltage
which is the correct direction we're
looking for and there we are
at around 12 volts perfecto so now that
that's out of the way we can move on to
destroying our fan we're actually gonna
snip off the 3-pin connector goodbye ow
and we're gonna have to figure out which
of these wires is positive and which one
is our ground because the other one the
third one is just a sensor for the fan
itself which we won't be needing so I'm
gonna go ahead and strip the wires down
that way we can expose the metal strands
underneath let's do a little test boot
here if you will I'm gonna bring the
laptop back briefly plug in the USB
cable which is still connected to our
step-up so all's I got to do now is pick
any two random wires and sort of make
them touch our soldering out
points and hey look at that we have a
connection so first try nailed it
we've just identified our positive and
ground wires so we can move on to
soldering all right soldering iron is on
and it's pretty much all heated up I
actually have it at 350 degrees Celsius
so it is hot and I'm gonna go ahead and
just brush it on this wet sponge briefly
just to remove any oxidization and this
is actually my first time soldering
folks so everyone say a prayer and
probably look up like an actual YouTube
tutorial on how to solder and don't do
what I'm about to do well it's not the
finest soldering job but hopefully it's
enough now we can let the solder dry for
about 30 seconds or so all right so now
we can test my soldering job by simply
plugging our USB cable into a power
source
ahahaha god works it works Oh feeling
cooler already it's got a nice it's got
a nice kind of breeze to it and it's
fairly quiet - good job Coolermaster
definitely feels like it's operating at
the full 800 rpm yeah yeah oh yeah at
this point I say we take care of this
ugly step up I mean it's functional we
know that now but it's also kind of an
eyesore so let's tape it up with some
electrical tape and then finally mount
the fan onto the tablet holder and then
we'll be done tablets span it sounds
stupid why they call it a tablet holder
what am i grandpa electrical tape
what I like about this is that at least
with the fan that I chose and the stand
I guess maybe they kind of pair nicely
together it actually kind of just looks
like a regular desk fan I mean you'd
really have to kind of give it a second
glance too to tell that it was sort of a
DIY project I'm not trying to toot my
own horn or anything but I don't know it
looks but it looks pretty good I
wouldn't be super embarrassed to have
this on my desk yeah I made that no big
deal I guess this is all to say that if
you guys are into tinkering with your
Hardware careful how you interpret that
and you like DIY projects then maybe
this is one to try out I don't know and
if you guys have already done something
like this or this exact project let us
know how it went in the comments below
if you have any tips to share with the
class as far as the RGB thing goes I
have not hooked it up I don't really
have a proper way to hook up RGB via USB
at the moment it'd be nice if I could
just pop it into the laptop along with
the fan but I do have a power supply
that's off-screen at the moment so I'll
just plug this in just to give you guys
a little hint huh that's what it would
look like if there was some some LED
action unfortunately I don't have the
controller set up or anything so we're
stuck with green so one out of three
ain't bad
you know we're missing that the R and
the B but at least we got the G thank
you so much for watching this video toss
a like on it if you enjoy this kind of
wacky stuff that we do occasionally and
maybe we'll do more of it in the future
go ahead and subscribe to the channel
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon and feel free to check us out on
floatplane for 3 bucks a month if you
want to watch our videos a whole week
early without ads I'll put a link for
that in the video description till next
time guys thank you for watching this
one have a good one and I'll see y'all
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
