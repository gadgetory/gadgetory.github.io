h1z1 and the occasional email check but
if she's gonna be working for me she's
going to need something a little bit
more substantial so we're going to go
desk hunting today at Target she
actually found the debt on their site
and the sale ends in three days so we're
just going to go get it now and we're
gonna revamp this whole corner because
it's just look at how tiny it is I mean
this is an m2 evolve this is their IPX
chassis which is already super tiny you
can see it already takes that pretty
much half the width of the table so it's
just not going to cut anymore we're
gonna try to put a filing cabinet under
here so that's what we're going to be
doing today and is there anything else
we need to get I think that's pretty
much it
my new chair possibly new chair I don't
know what's wrong with this one
this one looks perfectly adequate I mean
just because I have a $500 gaming chair
doesn't mean you need that Simon you're
gonna see any back support deal okay
you're right I don't want to pay a bunch
of health insurance for this gig so for
hiring you so maybe we'll get a new
chair as well let's just go to Target
see what's there yeah oh wait wait
well first off give me some of this
pwnage hmm we should probably call
target the one that we're going to you
to make sure if they have that table in
stock
hi I was wanting to check to see you had
an item in stock an item number one have
two four nine do a little dance Jeannie
okay okay thank you
you're doing great you're doing a good
job keep it up well you haven't finished
the job yet pull the storage cube we're
not put in with me here on that it needs
to be like a flat surface in camera no
but I mean it can't be like old cushiony
and fabrication it looks like it's
covered in a t-shirt dissident if it's
Tom and covering machetes at Unity
schools now I need to be wood or it
needs to be a solid complete solid
surface no because it's going to
infinity I'm the boss I'm putting my
foot down
hold it I guess services yes okay
perfect thank you very much go go go go
go go go go go driving in the car now
head to the target go to five desk-bound
and maybe a fine Japanese good now I
don't need some more fish there's simply
not enough we need your room for her
desk top now and the mechanical keyboard
end eating of a badge you can do a
little count
we're trying to find out where target is
you just look for the big red balls
better than blue balls I guess so slight
change of plans well we're sitting at
the table and all but we might have to
also get a little stand for the computer
so we can put it on the floor obviously
it's not going on the carpet the reason
why we're going to keep on the floor now
is because I forgot wifey sauce actually
needs to upgrade her keyboard to one
with a 10 key number pad and she'll be
doing like accounting and stuff and data
entry so she won't have much Dex desk
space left for like writing things in on
taking notes and stuff if there's a
computer on her desk so we need a little
bit of a platform here but so far we
haven't really found anything that looks
good like we could technically flip this
over but then that's not that's not
really flush so I'd love to keep looking
we found the desk I mean we're already
holding it for us at the front and guest
services but at least you get to kind of
take a look at it before we bring it
home looks nice
good good pick honey maybe the filing
cabinet could go to the left of the
table like you said and then the
computer could go on top of that but
then that adds quite a bit of length to
the table that it's probably gonna
encroach onto the weather where the TV
is so what in the middle of Target seems
like a weird idea shall we shall we
checked out oh yeah Cheers which one oh
yeah that's a crappy chair wait that one
I know that one good thing about the
chair we do have is a tiny and it will
fit
she said heck
and what the hell all right so I think
we're going to check out with our table
now and we're actually gonna head over
to Staples because hey they probably
have a wider selection of filing
cabinets in this place and B they'll
probably also have some platforms
potentially for our little computer so
hopefully we'll have better luck there
little bit don't get any ideas no you
don't you hate it that is that is not
the chair you're looking for all right
it is now night time we've been out for
a while we've been doing we've been
doing work so this is a final score guys
you get actually four wifey sauces a or
other business but we've got the chair
in the back there oh yeah we got a chair
we got a new chair for there's a table
of course desk dammit the desk and then
we've got a full trunk here a lot of
office supplies little knickknacks tape
staples and we got a filing cabinet -
whoo yeah we just we just kicked this
day in the balls let's go ahead and set
everything up now go
oh right it is all set up
mission complete y'all the desk and
everything else looks looks phenomenal
actually compared to the old desk there
wasn't even a desk was really just an
end table you can see how small it is
compared to the new one there's just a
lot more real estate to work with here I
also wanted to mention that she is going
to be using this desk for gaming as well
as you can see she's already fired up
some h1z1 it looks like she's already
kind of personalized it and made her
given it her little touch of flair this
is a pretty cool desk actually for only
what 86 months that we paid for it with
tax and everything it was under 90 bucks
out the door which is awesome you get
some like power to AC pastors as well as
a couple USB 2.0 pass-through boards
there just makes the cable management a
little bit more tidy the only downfall
is that well you can see over here we've
got the system now resting on the new
file cabinet the only bummer is that you
can't see the window now it's facing the
wall there so that's kind of a bummer
but maybe we can get some cool magnets
to put on that side and the chair the
chair is really nice as well
and I'm really happy with these
purchases because with the table the
table the chair in the filing cabinet
plus a bunch of other office supplies
from staples and stuff the total the
grand total came out to like four
hundred and fifty bucks for everything
so we did a pretty damn good job and I
think this is going to be a very nice
new comfortable home for wifey when
she's working for me or just you know
kicking ass in video games and stuff but
how do you like it honey I love it I was
saying earlier how I can't remember the
last time I had legroom like I can
actually stretch out my legs and school
bars right here actually kind of acts
like a footrest oh yeah I want to that
is kind of nice it's good for short
people like us when's the last time you
actually had a proper desk that wasn't
like you know and makeshift end table
probably when I was still
animal that wasn't even a real desk
either it was a Secretary's desk which
are the ones that have like cool thing
at the top and we pulled down like
literally like this big and like this
but I never I've actually never had a
property
well nice nice work today you did good
we both did a good good teamwork oh and
now we got to do the we got to do the
awkward this grab but cool thank you

me know what you think of the YP desk
