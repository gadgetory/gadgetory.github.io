another episode of stack attack the
ultimate 1v1 gaming showdown where
virtual combat meets real-life
challenges today I'll be going
head-to-head in the game of csgo arms
race but with me frackle Josh yes
Josh do you have any final words before
we get started today yes but they're all
four letters and you have to censor them
so we'll leave those unsaid perfect the
less you talk the better without further
ado let's jump into the rules the rules
of stack attack are simple before the
match begins four attack cards are dealt
randomly to each player players can play
their attacks on each other at almost
any time during the match but only one
attack per player can be in effect at a
time all attack cards are single-use
only the effects of some attacks are
time-based while others expire once a
challenge has been completed once per
match a player can summon a stack attack
by playing two cards at once to deal a
devastating combo once the player in the
lead is one kill or point away from
winning they'll have to surrender all
their unused attack cards to the other
player those are the rules may the best
player win now that we've got a little
refresher on the rules why don't we have
wifey sauce come in and deal out the
cards for to each person completely
random we're going come on make it make
them count honey okay
do it oh yeah I can already tell I got
the good ones so this besides me rude oh
no man I've got one or two here that's
well let's wait and see get over to your
battle station let's get this on the
road shall we just get this done I'm
ready to destroy your ass whoa let me
rephrase that
never mind just cut the pc3 7x gaming
headset from a strop and Sennheiser
brings you into the game with an open
back design featuring angled drivers for
pinpoint locational accuracy be heard
clearly through the fold-down noise
cancelling mic and enjoyed the
long-lasting comfort of large plush
velvet ear pads now available in an all
matte black finish so the headset looks
as good as it sounds for more info click
the link in the description and catch
the drop before it's gone
all right let's get it on you ready
little man let's do it boy okay three
two one go
I was already moving I've seen a few of
these episodes before against my better
judgement and I'm not sure what to
expect I know Kyle likes to hustle
people saying he's never played a game
before when it turns out he's like MLG
Pro somehow so I'm expecting I'm gonna
get owned
Josh doesn't game a whole lot I think he
games a little bit more than me and I
know for a fact he plays games like
insurgency and other tactical shooters
so part of me is a little bit nervous
but I guess we'll see what happens no
matter what happens Kyle is probably
gonna finish first that's right here are
your peanuts tell Fiona me here you what
I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
overpower your headphones so you can't
hear anything it's called noise
distraction that sounds like a really
good strategy Josh oh I see your ass are
you looking at my ass Kyle get sexual
harassment card was one of the channel
ass was looking at my eyes oh okay tea
baggers
yeah teabag me
teabag your Facebook bullets okay people
stab you go home man wait you show
yourself
Oh eat it Busey headshot
hell yeah you know I think you really
need to shake it off I don't think you
need a cookie what what son of a I think
the worst thing about this shake it off
challenge is people actually seeing me
holding the shape way this is the
dumbest thing ever
hey do you have to see what I'm doing
right now we're borrowing this challenge
from the minute to win it game show and
I've seen contestants struggle a lot
with this challenge so I'm a little
concerned right now how do you fucking
get it oh no I just shot somebody play
this isn't fair because no no I just you
I think you actually hit me son of them
God well you know what I don't have my
glasses on right now damn it yeah drop
the cookie okay focus on the cooking
do you normally eat like that all time
that's what I hear I'm going to
switching oh oh you're just making me
sick dude I really don't even want to
hear that man even looking at you is
making me kind of sick really have
yourself right now yeah beautiful how
much longer is Jesus turns out this
challenge was a lot easier than I
thought I could have used a no vote just
like that night it's funny because you
look like you're stroking and I sound
like I'm choking oh man we just entered
a whole new channel I can't wait for
this video to get to my son hell are you
the best things give me the arm cramps
for the rest of the frickin Randy is
anything to break when I'm done with
this he's gonna crap out of me wait kill
ya throw right there this is like
embarrassing really hard to do as if
just holding a shake weight and people
seeing that is not bad enough now I've
gotta stay here and shake the damn thing
while I'm trying to aim and trying to
look for Kyle doing this stuff
one-handed my arms are burning and I
just want to die oh sorry I didn't mean
to interrupt your your one-handed
activity you can tell when I see you
because I stopped shaking the shake with
a coat there he is
there you go okay
yes thinking a bit in the face I got
some money in there okay all right is
that a vegan approve never better cut
that thing if you actually want to do
some damage here I honestly don't see
how this attack can be difficult I had
onion rings last night not a single tear
man you know at least the quicker I lose
the car we're probably like what that
second said like josh is just a fussy
ginger right now that's me all the time
no you can still kill me I have a legit
crying right now dude oh dude this is so
bad you have no idea the tears are real
these are real tears so you're not using
fake tears right now oh dude oh you must
cry a lot when you games it doesn't seem
to affect you very much well I do have a
shotgun so you know white spread is
helping her oh my god man oh my god oh
my god seriously crying I can't believe
it Kyler's over there crying harder than
the last time you couldn't get on a ride
at Disneyland seems too short week ago
two weeks already
what the hell it is not affecting you at
all after the scope weapon oh man I
don't have fucking okay wait I'm playing
pixelated on you pixelated Oh deep ass
oh my god I have to sat down to the
lowest possible resolution like four by
three like 4k no not 4k that'll just
take your framerate just oh it didn't
apply okay thank God
oh I can see again ow hey cotner played
CS complete a few times I have only a
few times I'm still really bad you have
a show of uh playing the game Chris who
never plays this game beat me last time
we played you can't shame me into that
type of stuff I will shame the hell out
of you being on this video would be a
start in your face okay
he's all good all right now one thing
you're in notice is there's probably
excellent hair flow through that case I
literally got a look through the CPU
cooler cut out my vision is totally
wrecked right now I basically have to
look through a side panel window that
still has the plastic wrap on it and
then look through a CPU cooler cut out
with a bunch of cables dangling in the
way it's really putting a bad taste in
my mouth for the define us where are you
how is your t-shirt like made out of
Kevlar
oh man the people I gotta cringe and
watch me just missing every single
headshot holy crap yeah yes also you've
got all your little hand peripherals
over here I'm not used to that little
hand peripheral those little hands do
the creepy like they're creepy kind of
those are average or a little you
probably say that a lot don't you no
actually
okay okay
language barrier oh you son-of them
what's happening okay
Wow
I don't want to play right now I just
want to look at you evidently kyle has
some sort of treasure chest of medieval
torture devices at home that he just
brings into the office I don't want to
know why I don't know where he gets this
stuff but now it's in my mouth
okay okay I'll look at your hand
what games could you recommend for like
our 13 year old so this call it's
already going better than I thought I
can't understand myself but somehow this
guy is the patience to formulate words
are the guttural sounds on me okay like
is I see the snaps let's fan out okay
yeah cuz I'm not a while-- he really
likes games like that and he always
tells me he's not very good that he's
like a whiny tiny and it's really
starting to poverty so I thought I'd get
like a switch and you know transfer fair
play when it comes out
this attack is literally backfiring on
me right now I'm laughing so hard I
can't even shank the guy it's impossible
okay cool well thank you very much for
the help I really appreciate it
okay let's do snowflake boom gosh
alright so you're playing through the
snowflake POW huh maybe and it kind of
sucks so you're on the last friend where
you down to just nothing but nice
correct nice nice I really don't like
the fact that josh is playing my own
snowflake attack on me right now like
he's actually catching up pretty fast
and he could win this thing
how long have you had the knife like her
my last six kills or something at least
Oh
Shama Kim
and here we go come on come on you so oh
my god I love an ex killing spree how
the hell is that oh okay that's life
okay right here all right
keyboard and kranthi mouse go oh Jesus
you're right go go go disgusting okay
okay yep Wow okay that's a lot of Lube
that's so much Lube oh my god this feels
so bad you're doing such a good job feel
so bad that is the first time no this is
so uncomfortable
using these crappy five-dollar
peripherals is already bad enough
adding Lube to the mix just makes it
harder it's it's way too effective was
the brand of that loop again I hate
stuff on my hands I can't come on I will
kill you while lubed I don't give it
I got screwed I lost he won I mean he
had a fractal case so that was probably
all the advantage he needed but
congratulations the little guy for
reaching the keyboard I'll crap what's
the punishment
Josh prepare to taste my six inches
alright Josh here we are so for your
punishment I thought it would be a great
idea to have you enjoy this six inch
Subway sandwich definitely not one of
their pre-made options
our very own wifey sauce and Chris put
this together without my knowledge so I
don't even know what's in there so go
ahead and take your first party bite and
give us your best guess as to what's
going on in that sandwich it's not that
bad that was not even a bite it's fine
I've seen you eat before so I think you
just get a phone call tonight no you
should probably just ignore that there's
no saving you we've got we've got
trashcan on standby
um I guess tuna can't tell if it's like
salami or ham maybe pepperoni mayonnaise
I think you might need another bite just
to just to help you figure it out how
does it taste
this that was a lot worse oh yeah no
because because now you're getting to
the middle like where all the
ingredients congeal no it's like the
bottom of the garbage do you taste
anything new did a new ingredients
appear shame shame yeah all right I'm a
good sport so get it deep in there I'll
entertain you guys wait
there's a cookie and there isn't there
tuna and chocolate chip should not ever
be in the same bite I can't get it down
like my body is rejecting in the
consistency it's like doughy and squishy
and with chunks in it a fact I warmed up
- yeah I mean warm - the cells never
good it really it really just unmasks
all the flavors at once alright so what
was actually in here
waiver that sounds about right yeah I
would say like a waiver someone can't
sue subway I'm gonna try anyway okay I
think we're gonna cut it off here folks
before before we both lose it so Thank
You Josh for enduring this little little
journey with me I really do appreciate
it very it's been super great thank you
guys for watching toss like on the video
if you enjoyed it not sure what camera
I'm supposed to look in but we'll see
you guys next time here on the bigwig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
