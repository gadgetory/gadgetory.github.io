we should be live to YouTube
oh yeah as well as cool all right
then in that case welcome everybody
sorry we're late we're a little bit late
we had some technical difficulties
setting things up but we have a brand
new sound board here at Paul's place
yeah it is going to sound awesome
there's even fun cool effects that you
can do so it was all worth the
half-an-hour tardiness for today's show
I'm sure it will all be worth it in the
end but hashtag blame Paul for that one
yes okay Wow even even though people
were like oh it's probably the upholster
board people were still saying a hashtag
Blaine Kyle so I am partially
responsible just because it is seven
co-hosts so I will take some some of the
blame here that's good but it was mostly
your friended around
it was mostly possible speaking of
spreading things around yeah
Oh herpes wait no that's not where we
were going with that you can spread
around some merchandise on your skin yes
you most certainly can skin I'm gonna go
over the merchandise and a little intro
here quickly because we're a little bit
late but we do have some stellar new
designs in both of our stores right you
know for one the RGB everything we're
taking a look at my store first which is

of ammo on that one butter is out a
little bit might need to I switch over
so you mag very epic though very cool
I'm aware of bottlenecks yes so the
paper beware of bottlenecks this one's
from Steve this design is from Steve
monetizing that both Steve and mudsy are
getting money because of our t-shirt
contest that's currently ongoing um you
can still submit new designs guys this
is gonna just be an ongoing thing at
least for now but the beware bottlenecks
shirts also comes in two varieties and
get it in dirt
great or in that Cardinal Heather flavor
Arsenal Heather that's Sakura Cordia the
website I don't make up the names for
these John just tells me my go that's
Cardinal Heather Oh Heather
yep so yes go ahead and purchase any of
those also you can find new stuff on
Paul's store we've got the awesome

and on my half and you or you can go to
see their mania.com slash promotions
slash of calls are where dot php' live
yes yeah there's about nine thousand
entries so far but you're gonna win that
computer you're gonna win tech support
and warranty from main gear and
everything so but mostly it's a free
frickin computer 1800 a super nice
computer 1800 X and dual GTX 10 80s with
full custom water cooling as well as a
960 Pro nvme SSD it's a super nice
system section yeah we hope I win I
created 30 50 counts so she's nice
fingers crossed and I get it from either
put you in touch with Bank yeah you're
probably are in touch thank you like in
there but let's move on to our first
segment here which is VR updates there's
some headway being made in the VR game
recently we're doing wrong Oh wrong
lower thirds so that's okay we were we
were
Calvi our update though short-handed
this this morning so VR update you guys
you guys know it you love it
it's about be our stuff fallout 4 and
doom VFR has been previewed by some of
the folks over at WCC of tech this
articles from Christian Vaz and he went
to a Bethesda event recently and got to
play both of these triple-a VR titles
you don't hear that in the you don't
hear Triple A and VR in the same
sentence very often because we just
haven't seen games on this scale reached
the platform of virtual reality it's
still very much in its infancy but this
is aiming to change all that Bethesda is
doing some real work here in the gaming
industry when it comes to VR so first
off doom is not going to be a full port
of the original game or I shouldn't say
original but of doom 2016 it's gonna be
a short probably a shorter more
condensed version but still gonna have a
lot of the same you know sync characters
and I should say enemies graphic
fidelity and things like that you are
still gonna be able to move just as fast
in the 2016 version on the desktop as
you will as you will be in VR which was
a huge concern when you take something
like VR where a lot of people are prone
to motion sickness um sometimes people
are fearing like a lot of the concerns
are that you know the developers are
gonna hold back on how fast the
character can move in game and it's
going to dwindle the experience Doom is
fun because of how fast your character
can run around the map that's all part
of the action fortunately according to
Christian here he's saying that you are
still gonna feel that sense of
exhilaration and fast pace --mess pace
--mess is now word pasted a
submissiveness playing this game which
is super exciting to hear the left vibe
controller is going to be used to
teleport around the environment so you
are going to have the d-pad on the vibe
controller that allows you to move
freely just as you would like with a
keyboard and mouse I suppose however you
can also teleport which is going to
change the gameplay quite a bit I would
imagine but could also make it very fun
additionally you can use the right
controller as your for your weapon that
basically is your weapon I'm sure you
can switch so if you're left-handed you
could probably use your left controller
for shooting
stuff but it's also gonna be there for
weapon switching and things like that
this quote from him after his initial
impressions was saying I've played a
number of first-person shooters on the
vibe but none of them have matched the
same level of quality I played in that
short doom VFR demo which is very
exciting
I think VR kind of all wowed us at first
when we first tried it and then we were
like okay we're ready for the next big
thing we wanted to now be on par with
the same sort of gaming experience you
get on the desktop and I think
Bethesda's making some headway on making
that possible
doom VFR is gonna be launching
tentatively on December 1st of this year
super exciting ball out for a is gonna
be coming a little bit later on December
12th of the same year the left
controller here is gonna work as your
pip-boy now I've never played the
Fallout series I know I know you should
be crucified and hanged at the stake and
burned and all that but I am sort of
familiar with with Pip Boy and the VAT
system or I think I think there's a guy
because in Southern California is on
fire right now it's yes it kind of sucks
there's a guy down by the the canyon to
fire over here and you look up at the
sky and it's all there's smoke
everywhere so it looks like he played
the music for it and then he like looks
down and he had one of the pit boys it
does look like some end of the world
crap right now if you look outside where
we live it's just like some crazy red
skies and sunsets but what seems to me
to be like one of the most fun things
about fallout for VFR is combat when
you're in the power armor suit because
you're like almost like in a mech you're
almost like in a giant mech and so you
feel like this giant badass machine
monster thing that can just tower over
the enemies and stuff and deal some
damage so that seems pretty fun that of
course is gonna be a full game port over
to VR so it's almost gonna be like the
real full fallout 4 game just in Br and
so we're gonna see a hefty price a full
game price of $59.99 for that I forget
to mention for Doom it's gonna be so
this is a shorter condensed game it's
gonna be $30 on Steam
and then 64 fallout 4 so both of those
titles of lurch launching lurching
launching early December of this year
very exciting stuff our next article is
also about steam and valve valve
specifically developing custom lenses
for future VR displays this is an
article from overclocked 3d net thank
you Mark Campbell for the article
steamvr 2.0 tracking technology is what
they're calling it and valve is aiming
to make high quality VR more affordable
for the masses by designing their own VR
lenses they're designing their own
custom VR lenses so that the headset
makers can use their lenses instead of
investing in their own R&amp;amp;D to make that
happen the lenses are gonna be
supporting you know various LCD and OLED
displays and it's gonna be offering some
really wide ranges for field of view
anywhere between 85 and 120 degrees
which is pretty solid depending of
course on the displays that are being
used by the manufacturers the
manufacturers are gonna be using more
off-the-shelf parts rather than using
custom display solutions for for VR and
that's gonna equal but it's gonna equate
to cheaper VR headsets without money
without really reducing the or without
compromising on the quality so that's
gonna be good for for widespread
adoption valve is of course encouraging
the adoption of their technology by a
lot of these manufacturers and they're
intending to speed up the production of
their steamvr HMDs by reducing the
upfront cost of course with these
special lenses and all we can say all I
can say is I hope that it works out and
we don't see we don't see the same thing
happen to Justine VR as we did with
steam boxes because that was kind of an
epic fail that everyone was super
excited about it first yes and now you
don't even hear about them they're
pretty much obsolete but no I bet
there's beam VR HMDs though I bet
there's a lot about their students and
like we were going through college who
have written like dissertations on
that's teen bucks failing yeah maybe I
don't know yeah but I feel like I feel
like with with you know you go to school
on video games now that that be
something - yeah that's true if it
hasn't been then anyone out there is in
post graduate school then you feel free
to use my idea just you got a credit me
make sure you credit up there in the
people well I have a saved but haven't
had to use the word bibliography in like
20 years
I don't even know how it works now like
I got as all these really strict rules
for bibliographies like Bank and I never
followed them and it was like you have
to do this and then this has to be an
italics and put comma here and this in
this order and that's like you use I
mean you say being a websites and stuff
like that right
I don't know there's probably a proper
way to do it but you do have topics make
them a bit ly well your L while we're on
tangent though I want to point out that
you have no beard you're right and I
have no beard but we do have beer here
we do including a bottle of good old DTM
tremens oh my god it's got a it's got a
cork it's got a cork you should probably
take oh that's true
oh I'll handle this Kyle yeah you got
that one don't worry I'm not allowed to
touch those cut times never ends Bobby
you're all right by them since the
incident by the way while we uncork this
the new sound board is in effect that is
part of well my entire set up here had
been torn down and was in a state of
chaos which is why we're late
getting the new sound board in there was
part of it
we got a compressor on there now so if
we peek that's supposed to keep that
down for you headphone users we're set
fairly low right now we're about
compressor level 3 so 3 we need some
feedback in chat if we start to drink
some beer and get a little little happy
let us know in chat if we should go up
compressor level 4 or 5 we go up all the
way up to 10
does it go to 11 but here comes here
comes a quick sorry I have
I have minor PTSD from that incident
should have just pointed it around here
I'm gonna find that like a year or two
but work is forever gone what's uh let's
see sets have a little bit yeah yeah we
want to do some fries alright well we'll
kill this animal addictions again let's
make a impromptu black in ten seconds I
never understood those it's like why
don't you just get one beer first and
then get another beer afterwards like
while I just order a Guinness and I want
to go with the Guinness I'll get a
blonde or whatever the hell they mix
Black and Tans with yeah I was paying
attention to what you're saying it was
fairly useless so my keyboard mmm I did
about I did a bad pour so this makes it
even harder to Jewish you can smell the
foam you won't know you will you glass
what okay thanks
and some foam I was like it wouldn't go
away it's like I feel like I can't
swallow it
choking anyway well cheers Cheers
she goes to all of you as well thanks
for being here everyone mm-hmm okay I
think we're ready to continue
I think we are so let's talk about our
last article here for VR update this is
really brief Microsoft has announced
halo recruit for Windows 10 VR okay but
it's as the sub line here says it by
line but it's not exactly the halo we
actually want because it's just a demo
it's just a stupid five minute demo I
actually put this link in here before I
reading the article so I got super
excited cuz I used to play Halo back in
the day when I had an Xbox and stuff I
know console pleb I know again once
again and hang me crucified and do all
that stuff but
I did like halo it was a game that I
used to play split-screen with my
friends back in the day which isn't
something you can do very easily with a
lot of PC games even these days when it
comes to first-person shooters at least
and yeah this is gonna be on VR of
course it's gonna be just a 5 minute
demo perhaps we will see a full length
Halo game in the future but we don't
know if if the developer 343 industries
has any plans to do that it seems to be
just sort of a showcase right now for
the Windows 10 mixed mixed reality
headsets that are coming out okay so
those are gonna be releasing October
17th alongside the company's microsoft's
craters update the fall creators update
can't wait to see you all the treasures
that will bring and yeah I've actually
never tested out one of these mix
reality headsets yet so that'll be kind
of interesting I kinda wanna try that
out yeah it's it's fun watching the
people you know build minecraft in their
living room and stuff like that yeah
absolutely something new something
different pushing the boundaries of
technologies uh so yeah if you're a huge
Halo fan you might be into this if not
then you won't care but there's not much
to care about anyway because only five
minute demo all right cool let's move on
to our next segment here which is pit
mop PC however this is a special edition
to pit my PC this is the mostly pimped
edition because a lot of the systems you
guys sent in already looked pretty
pimped
so I think I think you guys have just
been learning so much from Paul and I or
you've been learning from our mistakes
and your systems are getting so good now
that you don't even need us anymore I
think we should just take full credit
all the good pcs are because of us it is
they really are now they know exactly
what not to do from looking at all of
our hard work so let's add let's just
start off with our first mostly pimped
PC that's from Takeshi Akashi but this
ye'll who she said sir I can't we can't
help not I can't help but say maybe
Asian words in an Asian accent
but to do my family offensive Asian
accents my whole Asian specialties I'm
so racist towards them uh so this is
takeshi's he said pick one please so I
guess he's got two systems here oh yeah
I like the white one you've got a 4790k
in here with the GT X 1080 from Galax
their Hall of Fame Edition three chunky
Corsair don't hassle the hoff and then
ace uses z97 saber-tooth Mark s
motherboard and s340 elite Kraken x6 -
yes this is a pretty sexy looking build
mr. takeshi seven like I said mostly
pimped I didn't have much to add here
other than perhaps I don't know I felt
like the the PCIe cables could be it's
kind of interesting how good they cross
over here yeah maybe it's the crossing
over that they were somehow stay next to
each other rather than yeah folded legs
you know right that yeah yeah yeah would
be more symmetrical perhaps he's got the
Supplemental so this is this is the the
white the Asus Sabretooth
he's got the Supplemental fan on there
great I wouldn't have no he said no and
the wires can loop it around I mean just
if just if we're nitpicking if we're
looking for something yeah it's very
obvious that's that's a little bit to me
motherboard I don't know if you could
rotate that and somehow tuck the cable
underneath the plastic I bet you crowd I
don't know that chick or or just not use
little fans like that I'm really yeah
I'm really not sure how effective that
is probably not at all the parry defense
market and stuff cables at the top I
don't know it's tough with the white
mother yeah it's dead blendin no problem
we wouldn't even have it a comment about
it but since the white motherboard you
have to be a lot more these could maybe
be finessed to vary a little bit but
like that yeah again nitpicking it's a
very very clean nice build over all
right your other blue build here also
super clean looking again except for the
the peg cable here yeah know what I do
about that
it's cuz it's such a short graphics card
I think if you're willing to sacrifice
it I mean depending on what power supply
you have in there and like how many how
many peg cables you have with the
connectors on them you can snip this one
off like right you can snip those down
at the base with some wire cutters and
and get rid of it but again I would only
do that if you have at least a few
backup cables you know you're never
gonna need anything beyond like eight
eight plus eight yeah you know or
something like that
beyond that you know you got another
little kind of loose cable here that
maybe it could be tucked down but
overall like super clean yeah I think
the PC a cable could actually be routed
just straight down behind the SSD where
that little holes go now back the little
because there's a little routing hole
behind the SSD here yeah isn't there
that's where the front panel connectors
coming out that might be a little narrow
down there on the s340 I'm not sure
maybe you might try to squeeze it
through there cuz it looks like it's
stretching a little bit off to the right
the case but overall very very nice
Takeshi Takeshi nice nice bill thanks
for sending those over Jule
Travis strips or slapdash with a water
cooled water cooled bill one of the
water cooled builds that looks really
cool because it's got fittings
everywhere yeah and straight runs I want
to do that because it seems really easy
but also that's cool I'd be curious what
your what your total cost was for
fittings yeah bill I mean it's not crazy
there's not like I mean these looks like
you're pretty efficient with them yeah
as far as where you needed to go right
but all right the Paris fly label
standing out just a little bit
got it got a got a touchy yellow in
there that doesn't match this yes with
the rest of the builds
mmm other than that like it's beautiful
that's it that's the only thing that
really sticks out yeah one thing I don't
know if it is perspective from the
camera angle again I'm nitpicking here
but it looks like the the tube that's
coming out of your graphics card on the
right it looks like it's kind of slanted
downward so maybe the the vertical
tubing piece that's coming from your
reservoir maybe it's a little short and
I can't be I can't tell what's going on
here as far as these two fittings here
but it looks like you know he's dealing
with a depth issue the the the fitting
coming out of the pump or out of the
pump down here is a little bit further
back in the case yeah than where this
one is coming out here right so he had
he had the he had to go back a little
bit so I was just I don't know we're in
chill I mean changing that you gotta
drain the whole loop and and everything
said but yeah yeah I mean you could you
could look at him let some some dual 45
rotaries might might do as far as
getting me out there but I mean that's
the only thing yeah that in the label in
the Paris block it's a beautiful system
it's it's beautiful Thank You Theresa
I feel like you've chosen quite quite
good-looking systems overall yeah this
is the mostly pimped edition of Pitt my
pieces oh I wasn't even paying attention
to that I'm sorry yes Wow Wow
because I got all this stuff going on
let's try to show whoa Dan top okay well
thank you very much traveese or Travis
Nathan Nathan back in back Thank You mr.
Thacker we've got a 6700 K with an AC
saber-tooth mark one the gtx 980ti for
the one three 32 gigs of some dump nets
fiyah fiyah fiyah oh look at that look
at this what is this this is a corsair
case this is a some case cases this case
are you
obsidian 750 no I mean that's a really
tall is that like seven got 900 d is
this ad no 900 DS way bigger I think
yeah but whatever case it is it looks
like you've done some people good cable
management inside of it can I got this
weird thing going over PA 50 deer 454
video City and a pity D is what we're
hearing for candy shop
Thank You Chad thanks Chad I was close
so I think the color scheme is really
nice here everything is super
matchy-matchy like how you have all
identical fans that's a huge turn-on for
me personally yeah gets me all
stimulated and those are nice-looking
fans as well and I like that the fans
are fans and the LEDs is kind of where
your colors coming from everything's
very subdued but you got just the
corners and the fans and the black so
LEDs which is making again the power
supply labels stand out just a bit to me
they owe me red there don't peel ABBA
instead of peeling it off do so put some
masking tape over that and like cut out
the ax and spray painted blue and make
it custom ax in blue let me cool or or
just go and buy an H X power supply I
was gonna say yeah it comes in blue
that's another option I want to point
out here this I looked at this is a
daisy-chained pci express graphics cable
it looks good I mean just this little
loop that he did over the top I mean it
looks like a professional yeah very
natural but natural I mean on the one
the cable comfort coming for the back
doesn't look quite as good but that
doesn't mean that a loop I'm just saying
normally the daisy chain peg connectors
don't look all that great right but
that's an interesting that he was able
to do that he's a professional cable
trainer yeah so very very clean build
again overall mostly my supply label
maybe I mean this this this system would
be totally topped off by a custom
sleeved cable sets oh yeah you know 80
to 100 bucks depending on who you go
through but be show floor ready you can
tell them your power supply info and get
get a set for it and that would maybe
put it maybe again do like mostly black
but it looks like one one cable and each
run blue the same blue color that one oh
I look pretty cool yep but yeah and of
course you're gonna get a lot of haters
on
for how you mounted your Paris flight
with the fan up fan up but personally
I'm up to you it's it's your choice just
know the pros and cons um I'm not I'm
not against it if you ever if you have a
reason for it or something didn't go for
it it's not terrible yeah um but thank
you very much for that Nathan beautiful
system next up we've got one from
Zachary Zachary what exact ring did an
1800 EXO we got a rising system here gtx
980ti 16 gigs of ram a kept 10 i kept in
240 ex white some deep cool captain yep
there i sponsored and yes they are and
an overclocked android figurine which i
think you know i'm usually not a huge
fan when when people put figurines or
like little you know I don't know like
actually figures in their system but
this is pulled off pretty nicely because
it just looks it almost looks like it
belongs it blends in yeah it blends in
so well it's not just like you just
stuck some random colorful figure eating
in there it matches perfectly with that
Tai Chi motherboard from as rock in the
background looks great
beautiful implementation of the cable
mod wrap the mod wraps leaving on the AO
tubing I think that's also pretty nice
looks very clean I mean will frayed at
the end yeah that's it so it's gonna
point out maybe I probably know what
happened sometimes they're kind of hard
to clamp and the clamps that they come
with are they look better than the
alternative clamps that are out there
but they're very hard to secure so it
looks like you might have frayed it
trying to get it on and just kind of
gave up on it or whatever or it broke
but everything else looks beautiful I
mean loving the Vengeance lpx Ram there
with the the white heat spreaders cable
management is just on point sir and yeah
everything looks great I love that
gigabyte card to t spray-paint that
white they don't make a card like that
white yeah I think this must be a no
actually they do Michael I think they do
have a white card with the white
backplate and everything or is that
custom I actually the backplate looks
custom cuz it's got the acrylic here
yeah
they do a curtain
I have to check on that yeah I mean I
don't I don't know for sure off the top
my head but regardless the grad looks
very clean very nice the fact that we
can't tell if you did it yourself or not
is a good sign yeah let's put it that
way
and yeah the the frayed edge of the the
cable the the sleeping there I think is
the only critique on this one yeah you
know thank you very much Zachary Zakia's
that good tech Kyle another Kyle Kyle
Vicky can with a different kind of
water-cooled RGB delicious RGB build
look at this we got red and we got blue
it's like you're separate it's like your
health in your mana I like I really like
that yeah
diablo throwback there also the color
scheme echoed here in the sleeves cables
yes I believe these are Dominator
platinum memories at least the dumpling
yeah and those are those also appear to
be custom painted to match the color
scheme a lot of modding going on um yeah
just like I mean look how the reservoir
tubing like like just goes into the the
back wall of that case lamps guys a case
like this is case lab yeah definitely
somebody going on here I mean this is a
beautiful system all you you managed to
like mix certain colors that
conventionally don't go together and
make it look absolutely stunning
yeah so kudos to you for that and the
fact that you've got the LED strips
going around the entirety of the case
just kind of providing an even lighting
and even its evenly lit all throughout
the case it's not just like you just lit
up one side of it and it's like kashkin
weird shadows and stuff it looks very
well lit I like how you just got some
simple white fans there at the bottom is
probably a radiator down there I'd be
interested to see what kind of temps
you're getting probably some really good
ones and I have like I have nothing
there yep there know there's there's
zero wrong with this build absolutely
yeah
this is one of those you're you are show
floor ready sir you are mrs. show floor
ready go go sample get in contact with
like gigabyte or one of the big
oh yeah motherboard manufacturers you
can basically build systems for them
yeah with that effort they're very well
done sir thanks now and then next up
last but not least we've got Jason Jason
Jin Jin Jin Jason okay win 303 lovely
case I like the 303 and nothing to wow I
this is one of those cases I like so
much I but I've never built in one
have you done well then one no I'm
saying the same for me yeah I'm like wow
this is so it's so nice but I just
haven't found the opportunity to but
this is a really well done system I
think I mean it's it's a fairly compact
mid tower and you managed to fit all the
water cooling hardware necessary to cool
both your CPU and GPU get a pretty
decently sized reservoir in there right
above a pump that looks like you used a
120 millimeter fan mount on that right
most man at the bottom of your case to
to mount the pump on - and then you
mount your you mounted your reservoir on
top of that very very clever and well
thought-out design you were thinking
here yeah I like that 750 series SSD
there's chilling at the bottom - that's
cool yeah the PCIe mmm-hmm didn't you do
it didn't you do it didn't you paint
yours at one point I did i spray-painted
mine black okay and you couldn't even
see it which is exactly what I wanted it
worked out beautifully so yeah I mean if
we're forgetting into critiques here
this is again a very very clean system
that's a there's a few things here and
there yeah some of them I'm
self-conscious about but just the grease
the 750 stands out a little bit to me
and I think your your mod that you did
on that might look clean in this build
yeah definitely mm-maybe well you have a
yellow or I'm sorry a pink motherboard
sticker that's that's really jumping at
me right here oh yeah which that's on
the motherboard right that's something
which the SATA ports yeah which it's
just one of the things you can pull off
and sometimes I've done the same thing
and not thought about it and whatever
but that you bestia that you can do um
keep you up at night
cabling overall looks really nice I feel
like there might be a little bit of
training or some combs that maybe could
be done to make the the PCI Express
graphics looks a little bit more
pristine right and
and the last one is like six I've just
done a bunch of two bending and I'm
super critical of the ones that I've
done and like the little flaws that they
have yeah for the most part looks okay
but like little flaws you you might have
a little bit a little bit of that going
on here and there is one the main one I
think for me is that this bottom one
here is not quite streets not quite
parallel to the case yeah I think that
and it might be an effect of like your
GP your graphics card having a little
bit of droop as well as that tilts it up
a little bit but again these are
nitpicky things again overall really
really solid build yeah I love that I
love that that the bend at the top
coming from that top rate yeah yeah
coming around there gorgeous it looks
very nice it's great um the silver
fittings I'm blind but any realize
there's two until 750 series SSDs in
here yeah there's one behind the pump
yeah everybody behind the reservoir one
and I'm in a PCI Express one down there
too
right cool very nice very nice built or
is that two of them yeah that's two of
them two of them all right so three yeah
did he say that Intel nvme and regular
SSP oh so I'm sorry these these are
matte these aren't the those are some
pretty serious yeah these are the ones
that the school trail logo on them
they're right I don't remember the but
yeah there's SATA ones okay yeah my 500
series living there intel 5 something
yeah okay very very nice builds all
around thank you very much chase it is
pimp my PC yes indeed so at this point
we can go ahead and sorry roll right
into our sponsor spot for this half of
the show okay we'll give them a link to
like right after you Bert yeah yeah all
right for so it's so we've got deep cool
who is our sponsor yet again and they've
got some cool stuff going on cool they
make cases they make it we have we have
their cases they make all catus as
priority effective being oh wait I want
to do
do sorry
people in jattu are expressing your
grievances on how your PC actually
needed real pimping we'll be doing this
segment again in the future it'll come
to have another opportunity to be on the
show and us give you terrible advice so
big thank you to deep pool for
sponsoring awesome hardware
they of course have a wide range of
cases and cooling components for your PC
building needs the product we are
focusing on today is the vehicle captain
240 V X we have the EXR GB here as well
as the he X RGB white edition they're
basically the same one is White's one is
nuts
so you 240 millimeter radiator you get a
forget which Jenner it's the latest
generation ace tech pump in there that
is powering the units which yeah you got
pre-applied chest paste have possibly
copper base plate looks like a fairly
straightforward mounting mechanism which
is good you get nice sleep tubing and I
do think like the tubing that they've
done on these newer versions it does not
kink very easily at all just good and I
still think deep cool at least with
these models has one of the most unique
looking water blocks
it's very polarizing I've heard some
people be like not so hard about it I
personally like it especially an extra
little loop that comes up it looks very
futuristic and there's nothing there's
no other water block like it so if you
want to set your system apart definitely
a nice way to do it I feel like most
people generally their eyes and in most
conventional mid towers and full towers
their eyes are directed towards the CPU
area of the system so you want to look
good you want to look good and of course
you can it's RGB so whatever color you
want and it looks like it looks like
it's an addressable RGB in the middle it
looks like you can actually have it do
like a color wave I can actually have
like you know the whole rainbow it's
compatible with all of the
RGB software's trying to make this
bigger that's really big compatible with
our old RGB software utilities such as
aura sync from a soos gigabyte RGB
fusion the msi mystic lights and a stock
RGB LED so it comes with the hub looks
like a hub for connecting multiple or
connecting your fans over the faint oh
yeah those are four pin okay so it comes
with a little hub adapter to connect
your fans up it comes with this little
guy here which you might also see in
their little RGB controller yes yeah
that's it that's right here which is
manual so these are nice to have if your
motherboard doesn't have an RGB header
on it right can connect you can just
connect it right up to this little guy
and it comes with an RGB LED strip yeah
so cool which is which is a nice add-on
as well
so there you go you get our LED strip
you get the RGB and the actual cooler
unit itself nicely commands to just all
blacked out with some gray rubber pieces
on the ends on the corners for reduced
noise and vibration they kind of have
like some weird slits at the end of the
blades just for added something I don't
know but it probably does something I
have a researcher probably does does
good things those good things very good
black sleep cabling though also very
nice
so yes cool deep cool thanks again first
monsura got some hardware
thanks you guys if you want to check out
deep pool did you put a link deep cool
in the description I do not but there
will be a link there will be a link
description very soon yes all right I'll
put that in right now well I shouldn't
be unboxing the white version of the
captain 240 X on Paul's house so that
was actually really nice it is that soon
all right
listen uh on - oh looks good MIRR News
News News News News News no that's
that's what we do for tails in space
tails from space there might be at the
there might be the ability to do that on
SM board now oh yeah we've got sort of a
reverb echo there's a bunch of sound
effects of
do now we haven't tested any of them out
yet well are we doing it right now is it
happening no no see I said it there and
then I can apply I can apply it to us
with the with the FX knob simply so
years oh my god Wow they're going crazy
but why is twitch so common though she
keeps going freaking out no I trust
which trich twitches much more
trustworthy than YouTube yeah YouTube
was trying to convince us for a while
that IO wasn't working at all I know and
I'm like you to use this stuff and I'm
like looking at twitch and there's just
nothing about the idea that's like
you're lying
you've lying sexist shitty we watching
YouTube sons of bitches
alright so echo all right we got more
effects we got more effects we might
kick in there too oh my goodness
so first news is Windows Phone is bad
news phone is dead it's holy crap
this is a sad for some and other people
don't give a sh right because you know
some people would you so basically this
was a tweet that was sent out from
Microsoft's Joe Belfiore Italian and
racism II can make it sound is probably
the best pronunciation so Bell Fiona is
has confirmed a Twitter post that there
will not be any future plans for for
making new updates or new hardware
implementations for Windows Mobile which
means that there are no more windows
phones coming anytime soon so if you're
a huge fan of that platform for your
mobile devices that's candy candy then
I'm sorry it is all gone and dead and
forever in lost and you suck and you
should just hop on to you just buy an
iPhone 5 sad for what every phone users
it's very sad however Microsoft will
still be rolling out security updates
and bug fixes for existing Windows Phone
users so you have to worry too much it's
not quite end of life but its end of
production and innovation and creativity
and inspiration which is equally
depressing if not more so umm Belfiore
claimed that Microsoft Microsoft tried
very hard to incentivize a lot of app
developers to to hop onto the platform
you say hey we'll give you money we'll
give you money make some
last for the Windows Store on mobile
because there's like three apps right
now the people can download and and one
of them's just like you know ones like
Andrea only for some reason but they
just didn't have the numbers they didn't
have enough people on the platform to
begin with for companies to really
invest which is quite unfortunate which
led to pretty much a dearth of apps that
you could find on the Windows Store I
like that word
dude dude sounds like dirt but it's not
do so the yeah so that's that's kind of
sad so so I guess you know users for the
most part you're gonna have to resort to
the big dogs the big smartphone users or
a big smartphone champs which include
Apple Google Android Android so I mean I
guess phone manufacturers speaking phone
nine different manufacturers we now have
Apple Samsung and Google Google with
their with their pixels quickly catching
steam or gaining steam I heard a pixel
did you get a pixel - I got a pixel -
did you really yeah wait really so so
this is this is interesting okay if we
go on a tangent here you the fact that
it doesn't have a headphone jack didn't
bother you at all it did and then but
you inevitably weighed the pros and cons
and felt up the pros of everything that
Google offers and their phones now
outweighs your ability to listen to hard
wired headphones no oh no I saw I saw
John TLD today tweet that he had ordered
his and I was like I should everyone -
and I did this bit just like mindlessly
like a mindless sheep like dude no no
further questions at no further
questions your honor
no analysis no interest in introspective
and anything I was gonna be that honest
smells like think you guys I can let us
say something I would tell the truth the
brutal truth I was okay it's a part of
it is that is it I'm handing down my
existing pixel to my wife she's really
been wanting a new phone for quite a
while what photos show she has a 5x and
X is 5x okay she really likes the Google
phones okay but yeah well that makes a
great new jobs like John - it's like you
know I see you stuff memory so on but if
you always just bought any phone or
gadget then jaunty lot you would have
every guest imaginable to bother gaming
I can give it a little bit more
explanation to that my pixel is my
favorite phone all the phones I've had
it's my favorite - really really liked
it yes I agree so I don't think it's
that there is seconds again the thing
the thing with my wife yeah and then
third is act cool my thought process
wasn't like it wasn't about like I want
that or it was that if I'm gonna if I'm
gonna order it I need to do it early in
the ordering process so that I get it as
early as possible so I can hopefully
make some content on it well it's as
relevant as possible all that kind of
goes into the business expense
all that was it that process as well
John show yeah okay that cool part of it
well sweet hey you know I hmm I would
say this I understand the timeliness of
getting the review out so maybe you
could do this you could do a initial
first impressions review of the of the
pixel - and then I'm giving you content
ideas right now Paul but and then do as
lots of people have early access to it
there's lots of videos on it if I'm
gonna do content out it's okay I get it
I get it use analytics and then hear me
out here the early access is completely
 for the for the idea that I
have because you what's even more
important I think and more interesting
is to do a let's say a two three four
month follow-up video where you talk
about what it's like to have a phone for
the first time in your life with
a headphone jack oh yeah and then answer
the question is it still worth it if you
weigh all the pros and cons okay what is
it like cuz I that's a video I would
watch personally someone who's been
using a phone for the first time without
a headphone jack what their experience
has been like because part of me feels
like your options are to use your
options are to use an adapter out of the
US better the C 2 type C port right and
you can't charge I mean most people are
gonna be usually - it's it's headphones
sure I have been using bluetooth
headphones more and more often man again
I don't think they should be removing
the headphone jack I'd rather have it
had a headphone jack on there right I'd
rather had a microSD card slot you do
yep those are things that I would say
and into discreet graphics I want I
would want to have and if they made the
phone perfect and you know if like
Samsung or some other third-party
company came out with a phone that had
those things and was otherwise the ankle
quality yeah you'd be interested and
then you know I'd be very interested in
that - so does the this is a pixel - I
don't know if it was a rumor or not but
does it actually have a curved screen no
it doesn't okay
facing speakers oh that's nice I sure
hope that's great I you heard it here
and also Hardware first folks I need to
double check Paul from awesome Hardware
claims and has confirmed the speakers
will reach the pixel - we sent - at like
an alert from Google 5 and we're
watching you YouTube's spreading a false
information that your print front-facing
speakers yeah so you did a little bit of
homework then see ya pull the trigger
that's good
I wasn't assuming that at all and you
know what now I'm just salty because I
know that now that you've ordered yours
I'm gonna feel the pressure to order
mine but I actually have a practical
pragmatic excuse to get a new phone as
well because ever since you break your
screen no even worse this all goes back
to me popping a bottle of Shimei in my
face yeah because at that moment not
only did some beer oh you guys only saw
the beer get all over my face
switch granted was the best part but on
top of that the beer also got all over
my phone and it wasn't working at all
for like the first 24 hours and then I
let it dry out and did the rice thing I
was like okay it's back to normal
however it is not there are certain
things about this phone that are not the
same and that will probably never be the
same probably the worst I could send
it's gotten better is it learning no its
machine learning this is what machine
learning is right this is what NVIDIA
has been talking about all the time no
the one thing that I cannot stand after
that incident is that it does not
connect to Wi-Fi
I have no Wi-Fi no this phone has no
Wi-Fi it just all seeks forever and then
it will never connect and really home
Wi-Fi crappy at work so I'm like that
that alone is worth just buying you a
metered data plan
I am I only have agreed yeah I am I only
have a two gig day to play oh that's
horrendous well it's actually it's
actually unlimited but they throttle the
speed after two gigs which is basically
the same as cutting you off completely
gasps awful thing takes like unusable
like you know 30 seconds to load a page
or something which is just not not 20-17
friendly yeah so uh yeah I may I may be
getting myself one of those pretty soon
who knows or at least a new phone Samson
yeah I hope so too
we can hope for the best in Google We
Trust right but let's move on we've
digressed like J hardcore here let's
talk about briefly that MSI has burner
beta released a new afterburner beta
this is the beta 19 of afterburner for
point 4.0 which now has new low-level
access to the SMC microcontroller on RX
Vega GPUs meaning that users can now
have an alternate or an alternative to
using AMD global wot man when
controlling big attend voltage users now
have full voltage control with RX Vega
cards
I believe the workstation bigger cards
as well so that's exciting
um a afterburner does not offer the per
P states like what man does however
there's just a simple voltage slider
that you can
control the the core voltage and stuff
which is for most people good enough
this is good because under revolting
Vega as we've seen from folks like
gamers Nexus and other catalysts
reviewers can actually help improve
overclocking in certain instances so
it's nice to be able to because I rarely
ever change the voltage on a card unless
it's some weird situational thing like
with our XV guy and so being able to do
that now
not just in watt man here's the other
pro of this update is that watt man can
sometimes be buggy at least in my
personal experience it's not 100% solid
stable all the time so having an
alternative just to and also it's nice
to have an alternative overclocking
utility just to cross verify and make
sure that it's not the software that's
buggy everything's working properly and
things like that so this is good news if
you have an RX Vega card and you're
planning to overclock or change the
voltage at all you now have full control
additionally we have full control with
the GTX with the upcoming gtx 1070 TI
which is probably not quite as
surprising because it's still using the
same GP 104 GPU as the gtx 7d so they
probably wasn't much that msi had to do
to implement that feature but it is nice
rest assured afterburner is still in the
game it's one of my favorite
overclocking utilities personally
especially because they also have now if
you scroll down I think they'll they've
also added a GPU power draw graph which
is very handy I had that before didn't
power draw yeah I think that was ok I
think you could do that for some reason
the article says it's new and I know
maybe maybe that's no right there too
utilized it um let's see yeah it says
says that it was it was recently added
ok perhaps they dress the article more
than me
yeah dress him yeah at any rate it's
nice to have that option I like I like
afterburner I don't know any other
overclocking utilities that have that
much data real time data
gpus and stuff so that's nice all right
let's see w CCF Tech did an article
recently on the 8700 K and the 8600 K
being sold in pre in prebend variants
okay pre bin variance and with custom
IHSS this is from the folks at case
Kingdom de which is a German website
they've been in collaboration with the
very famous devourer to sell or offer
the world a series of prebend coffee
lake and correc CPUs later to follow
which will also include different clock
speeds they're really like like seven
eight hundred dollars yes no I was
saying are they like laser etched with
their Bowers logo on oh I am not sure if
that's just a Photoshop trick or if
they're actually laser etched but there
is an option interesting I mean if they
let them that would be nice there is an
option to buy because spends 800 they
better be custom everything okay I mean
it's literally double at least double of
what in 8700 K retails for MSRP what's
the difference between the ultra Edition
and the pro edition so there's actually
three tiers that we can talk about here
the first which is the Advanced Edition
which is prebend okay so these are pre
been chips with no special IHS or
thermal interface material so really
they're just bend chips and they can
chip at frequencies between 4.8 and 5.1
gigahertz this is very similar to what
EVGA did with their kingpins series of
gtx 980ti cards and also with the gtx
980ti cards where they you know sold
them based on their ASIC quality at
different at different price points this
is kind of what we're seeing here but
with CPU silicon and again we're seeing
shipping we're seeing them ship up to
five point one gigahertz for the
Advanced Edition if you opt for the Pro
Edition okay this is this applies once
again for either the 80 600 K Core i5 or
the i7 8700
the pro edition you get the same prebend
clock options however you now have
better nickel plated and polished IHSS
or internal heat spreaders okay so
whatever that does for thermals or yeah
mainly for thermals I don't know it's
gonna require some testing I'm sure
someone like gamers Nexus is gonna miss
Pro Edition so what's ultra so the ultra
edition of course is the fanciest and
that goes they will be shipping up to
five point two gigahertz other heavily
bend CPUs with a 99.9 percent silver IHS
along with liquid metal thermal
interface material so these have all
been deleted so one way or another is
silver known for its it's not quite as
conductive as copper I believe so I
don't know how much of a difference it
would make
why not just make them copper well let's
just make them so copper all right all
right I'm cool your most expensive
eighty six hundred KS are five to six
hundred euros yeah just yeah the
practicality of spending this much
eighty six hundred K when you can spend
less to just get an eighty seven hundred
K or you goes all right well let's
assume they're going for like the other
you know max over maxing this is a
single core performance whatever this is
for niche or for gaming these
overclocking whatever but it's I don't
know it still seems completely
impractical to me to spend more on an
eighty six hundred K than an eighty
seven hundred K yes because there's some
pretty significant advantages to the
hyper tuning right I guess it kind of
falls back on like why would you ever
spend money on a prebuilt system that's
got custom water cooling all done for
you it's to save the time and perhaps
the the effort that goes in to doing
this because now we're seeing these
these chips get really hot and that's
the thing about coffee lake is that it's
now the fastest gaming CPU on the market
it's clearly the fastest gaming CPU for
2017 but the thermals are kind of
the thermals aren't that great
so if
you're the type of enthusiast who wants
to overclock who wants to get the best
performance out of the chip possible but
it's also sort of weary about deleting
your own CPU and potentially breaking it
or something like that and you would
rather have a professional like der
Bower or the folks at caseking de do all
that for you then I guess again we're
talking about a very niche market that
is not going to appeal to 99.9% of the
gaming community or the PC building
community but there you have it it there
is a business for it somehow and
especially now because the 8700 K like
coffee like chips and this is this leads
right into our I guess this is our last
article for today oh good
you can't find coffee like we're in a
shortage already I've wanted to find a
lake of coffee food forever you must be
really tired Paul this is from
overclocked 3d not overclocked 3d net as
well there's been a shortage a huge
scarcity of coffee lake CPUs right at
launch and this is again probably due to
the fact that Intel launched this
platform really early a lot earlier than
they planned initially to compete with
Reisen
but what doesn't make sense is that now
that they've released coffee lake and no
one can buy coffee lake chips because
there's just not enough inventory to
meet the demands of consumers how does
this really compete with Rison in any
way if anything it's worse for Intel now
because now nobody's gonna touch KT Lake
with a 10-foot Pole because it's old
news they're gonna they're gonna hold
out now for Cape air for coffee Lake to
finally get back in stock and according
to hard o CPUs are tainted squirrel he
published his his conversation with new
egg support new egg the the retailer of
course that there's still 30 days plus
out from receiving their 8700 case
samples so people have already
pre-ordered and and purchased actually
coffee like CPUs from and they're not
these these consumers these customers
are not receiving their samples for
weeks perhaps even months because Intel
decided to rush this launch so hard
because they were scared of AMV and and
the rhizome launch and they weren't like
we gotta have our we gotta have
something new for the holidays guys
AMD's crushing us right now and they
completely overlooked logistics being
very short-sighted with this launch and
not many people are happy with it and
now you can't buy or it's very hard to
buy a coffee like CPU so this all goes
back to well maybe there is now a little
bit more justification in purchasing a
coffee like CPU from der Bauer or
caseking de for almost double the price
if you were so set and ready to go on
purchasing coffee like and buying into
the Z 370 platform but lo and behold
there is no stock anywhere even the
biggest retailers like Newegg again and
Amazon I could not find any I could not
find any this morning I checked maybe
they were there now but there's a huge
vast shortage and this is widespread not
just with the US but we've also seen
foreign countries abroad struggle with
keeping coffee like inventory in stock
so it's kind of a clusterfuck it really
is just kind of a clusterfuck and I feel
like I feel like perhaps it gives you
know people like your Bauer and
companies like case King is sort of an
opportunity to like swoop in and save
the day like hey look you know we Bend a
bunch of these CPUs that you can't find
anywhere else we've deleted them for you
we've reapplied them reapplied or
applied liquid metal Tim and now they
clock way better and they run a lot
cooler sure they're double the price but
it's not like you could buy one for a
regular price right now anyway that sort
of thing and again so super lines yet
realistic Micro Center Micro Center sold
8700 KS for like 500 bucks each
you know yeah well over MSRP but they
all sold out yeah so as Micro Center for
as awesome as their CPU prices really
are right when they recognize the
situation where they knew they could
sell their very limited inventory for a
much higher price yeah they went ahead
did that yep and that's typically the
case the people who really want it for
people who really want something money
is not an option
money is no object I should say object I
mean we've seen this with everything
that is quote unquote desirable like the
Super NES emulator or you know the mini
SNES or whatever people are selling them
for double triple quadruple the price on
eBay and still you selling out like
hotcakes so same goes for here
apparently but on that note so ladies
and gentleman I'm gonna sum up or wrap
up my half of the show we do have some
donations to call out because you guys
have been super donation yeah yeah yeah
let's go through these quickly robbery
up crib for the 28th Kyle I sent
something to your P o box a few weeks
ago but it's ended up at the post office
too bulky maybe the tracking link is
telling me that it'll get sent back view
bucks is a post office yes it is so
maybe where it is yeah yeah exactly it's
probably there so I'm gonna check my PA
box ooh and I'm sure it's I'm sure it's
just fine there's a large item it goes
over either choice to a different socks
and they give you a key for it or they
hold it back behind the counter but yeah
okay we'll check that I will check it
soon thank you very much right right
ten dollars Kyle I found out you never
took your wife to a nice dinner like I
paid for several weeks ago well you have
one week to do so in post video or you
will pay the price next week okay bread
you are dangerous you are scary and I am
slightly nervous around you so I will
take my wife out to a nice nice dinner
or a nice nice date night well but the
nice day I'll tweet it pic sir didn't
happen for sure thank you very much for
it for the donation does Joan's five
bucks hey guys trying to keep saving for
thread Ripper to future-proof
different keys my keys no I brought
Heather's keys today so today sorry
disjoints I keep saving for predators
for should I should I keep saving for
throat over to future-proof budget and
get 1600 ex wait for zen second-gen or
go 8700 k coffee lake thoughts honestly
dude I feel like the 1600 X out of all
that is the best bang for the buck you
still have enough
great path to get more cores and faster
clock speeds in the future if you so
choose on the am4 platform which the
1600 x is on thread ripper is amazing
but also very expensive and maybe
overkill for your needs again I don't
know any more information to find out
exactly what you're doing but an 87 okay
like we just discussed cannot really get
right now why waiting out that ISO
bottle of below the irony John John's
gonna send me bottle of booze great yeah
sure okay continuing Atlas $5 now that
bit wit Ultra is disappearing have you
considered replacing it with an early
access on Linus float playing club
platform so this is a very interesting
question and something that I've thought
a lot about recently for those of you
don't know YouTube is actually halting
there permanently ceasing all paid
channels on their platform which means
those of you who are familiar with it
would alter my my early access channel
that's going to be going away and I will
not have that anymore
what I have tentatively decided as of
now is to just move everything over to
patreon because I'm still posting my
content to patreon a week before it ever
arrives on the main channel it's for a
buck-fifty month right now so I think
that's for now that's what I'm gonna do
I'm just going to switch everything over
to patreon completely get rid of a bit
with Ultra on YouTube it's still gonna
be branded as a bit with Ultra but just
the whittle true through patreon so
hopefully that makes sense and sorry if
that causes any convenience for any of
you
I really am bummed about this because it
was nice keeping everything on a single
platform and of course you know patreon
is also very nice to work with and you
know I really like the way that they do
things there but it is still a separate
website and different login and it's
kind of inconvenient for you guys so I
do apologize for that
as far as
Linus's floatplane cook club is
concerned he has reached out to me
and Paul as well on multiple occasions
to see if we were interested we have
both expressed a certain degree of
interest and so I'm sure we will be
hearing from him soon enough he will be
following up with us I'm sure whenever
he's ready to do so I have no idea at
what stage in their development they're
ready to actually launch this thing but
it's something that we are not ruling
out entirely at this point
next up Fred rent once again little
trailers this is your brain
Paul popping a cork this is your brain
on drugs
Kyle popping the cork lol that that
should be big skill yeah you should you
should work for like a school district
or something that is good stuff man this
is really good stuff
Linus No Linus Johansson different Linus
100 sex no not the next one has ekx SEK
plural of SEK is sex not the type of sex
anyway you guys are awesome cheers from

sorry if you were great I'm $19.99 five
dollars sold about 4790k for 8700 k
didn't make it to Micro Center in time
on Thursday just a ride no right should
I rise in or wait how long no gaming in
two weeks now cheap PC for now don't so
my 4790 if he already sold a 4790k then
it's like selling a house before you
have a new house to move into you um you
can invest in Rison now though I mean
rise ins available and air and
functional and works and there's a good
platform and has a solid upgrade path
and a promise from a and B then it'll be
a platform that they have stuff going on
through 2020 we're expecting then -
based stuff on there so that's it's
pretty solid
oh yes and yeah if Intel has gotten any
benefits from rushing the launch of
their coffee leg platform there's
certainly the flip side to that which is
that AMD actually has stuff available
that you can buyer in it yeah which is
coffee like you can't so yeah I'd say
rise an investment wouldn't be a bad
wouldn't be a bad decision right now
I agree Stephen Hill $20 child support

Barbie ed ah five or whatever or is

board that boards fine unless it doesn't
support SLI and you're trying to do a
multi-gpu config then na na na na na
Brown maybe maybe the killer s alive if
it's a higher to your board may have a
little bit more refined of a be real
Brazilian currency is called a real

I wonder what I wonder what a kick out
of it though which would guess oh that
is true but I wonder what color you
would get in super chat if you don't
either like what are the colors to go up
to like red I know Reds like 100 plus is
what we've seen I don't know if there's
any color beyond that like I should be a
platinum like a shiny or its RGB
very suitable all right what did what
did my wife say hi honey listen to Fred
I like food
love you love wifey ah yes of
course I will listen to Fred and they
will take you out to a nice dinner it'll

time when I've been drinking uh Silvio
el condado
your last names Alcantara a sexiest last
name I've ever heard
I'm super jelly $5.00 now that the I 787
70k is out 8700 K Amy I'm sorry yeah I
was like is there any reason to get the
7800 X which X $2.99 processor do you
recommend that's that's a tough that's
tough to say honestly if you're gaming
8700 K if you are we are focused on
workstation stuff than the X 299
platform would be more suitable right as
far as breaking it down as to which X -
9 n or sky like X CPU to get it really
just kind of depends on your budget and
and if you want the best of the best if
you don't need like the absolute like if
you don't need the 18 core then just get
something that is within your budget and
it's not gonna hurt you too much because
you can spend that money but thank you
very much
Silvio Alcantara with the cool last name
dag miss 8 for the 5 bucks MC sold out
of 8700 K's because they had maybe 10
per store and price matched Newegg also
those cheat those chet etas
those chatty TAS maybe when they expect
positive inventory what is he not a TAS
he's talking about the chatty TAS with
new egg which I probably actually know
right everyone doing for many years so
my information is probably a little bit
outdated but if you're talking to a rep
that you call in it's a customer service
you're talking to someone who's at
warehouse one in the customer service
call center over and whereas one not all
of the customer service agents have
access to the POS system
well they all have access to the PL
system but I might
have access to the item maintain system
which actually has like all of the
numbers quantities you can look at
incoming orders and that kind of stuff
we got to talk to somebody a little bit
higher up to be able to actually say
something like we have 3000 quantity of
these coming in to say that like
verifiably at least in my history
working there you would have to be
talking to somebody with more access so
it could be it could be accurate sure um
or you know it's it's it's a call center
they hire agents to go in and work the
call center every agent is different
some agents say stuff because they want
to and it's not all accurate
that happens yeah hey I'm pretending
like I was listening to everything
you're saying that's a I hate you with
that a couple times around the same page
