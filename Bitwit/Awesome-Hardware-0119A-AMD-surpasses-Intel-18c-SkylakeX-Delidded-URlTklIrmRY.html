to awesome hardware this is a live show
that Paul and I do every single Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right here on
twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware we also stream to
YouTube on our respective YouTube
channels on that platform we like to
split the episode up into two halves
this week the first half is on my
channel which you're watching right now
and then afterwards you can head over to
the pulse channel which is you can calm
slash Paul's hardware you can also find
a link in the description below but it's
a fun spun tech news show loosely spun
it's always fun I would like to have a
few drinks we occasionally swear so if
you have virgin ears or sensitive ears
then maybe bring a pair of earmuffs to
the conversation and hopefully you guys
can drink along with us if you are of
legal drinking age in whichever country
you belong and that's pretty much it we
sell stuff if not you can have a
mountain Dew you get up about new just
classic classic PC games right there
sponsoring today's episode no they're
not no I wish probably not but by
something at Kyle's store my store
especially if you're a woman yeah I just
started selling a female shirts you can
wear them if you're a male too they just
I don't know if this wouldn't fit well
yeah so Heather if your whitening sauce
actually picked up the colors I had
nothing to do with this she felt that
she liked those two colors the best so
good does he guys if you guys have any
spouses or significant others
girlfriends or anything like that who
might want to rock the bit with brand go
ahead and pick up one of those
restaurants their movies right across
from boobies
Paul's also selling stuff on Paul's
hardware net I also have women's shirts
women sure so a point that I've had I've
been catering to the female demographic
who watches our shows feminist would
kill me first
there's you gotta give your data to this
to the ladies out there true of course
we also have mugs pint glasses other
types of paraphernalia feel free to buy
those while you're watching the show and
we'll shut your name out at the end of
each half yes
but also yell Johnson well you still
don't know exactly why we do that
no it's slightly offensive but kind of
funny
I will silence my phone I'm breaking my
own rule right now okay right now we're
drinking Newcastle new cats imported
from the UK yep
it's actually important here I saw
someone talk about Newcastle and they
said that they were surprised to see it
in the United States it's very common it
oh yes I mean like when you go to like
bars or or liquor stores that really
just have a dearth of options they'll
still usually have Newcastle yeah I'm
the most popular I think it's
distributed by one of the large yeah
beer manufacturers I think I don't know
which one you might say in the bubble
right up there with we had bubbles
we're not plebs alright so let's just
dive right in to some of the tech news
that we've got here actually we'll start
off a games report let's let's talk
about some video games amiga games and
what's going on in the video game
industry
that's not all-encompassing I'm only
it's a good thing we're doing the games
apart because there was nothing people
like to hear about games and they've
been waiting for the game support to
hear information about it that's usually
most that's most people's primary
primary source of gaming info this is
true from my understanding and us and
surely the three articles that I've
picked out for today's segment will
cover everything that is going all you
need to know in the gaming industry at
the moment so first off congratulations
to pub G player unknowns battlegrounds
for selling over 10 million copies this
was on every game last night I could
find today so it's worth pointing out
this one in particular from PC gamer 10
million copies sold since the game first
launched back in March of this year at
the end of March so I thought it was
still in beta I thought they haven't
even lunch yet yeah technically it's an
early access lunch so I mean for a game
that's not even fully developed it's
it's doing really well
165 days since it's been out the game's
not even finished and it's already
passed up csgo and dota 2 in the overall
steam player account which is very
impressive it's also one of the most if
not the most streamed
game on twitch right now or at least it
was I don't know exactly where it is
right now but it's high up there guys it
also set a new record for peak
concurrent users nearly a million peak
concurrent users it's it's like on pace
to break a million at some point oh yeah
yeah it's it's pretty crazy also the
article mentions that I didn't notice
the Terry Crews apparently plays this
game with his son oh yeah most likely
most definitely maybe you should follow
his YouTube channel most definitely on
what hardly follow my own oh I hardly
thought yeah he most definitely is
playing pub G on the epic Creek that
Chase do sense built for him I'm sure so
that's pretty cool there's also new
vaulting animations and a new map that
are on the way for the game so it's
gonna keep overall excitement at an
all-time high
a ludicrous all-time high 10 million
copies how much money is that I mean how
much does the game go for like 30 bucks
by new vaulting at animations does that
mean new animations for when you break
into a vault or new animations of you
vaulting over things I think vaulting
over things or it could mean both it
could be an all-encompassing word that's
that's true that they didn't specify
that maybe they're gonna introduce
safecracking please to pub G who's
Fraser Brown I'm never reading an
article from you again Fraser confusing
no this is the next that's the other one
sorry Fraser casting disparaging
comments on Fraser Brown all he was
trying to do is bring people more
information about the oculus rift ipalo
sitting here trashing him I owe you an
apology Fraser it's really it's really
it's really Joe Donnelly writing style
yeah I even need to say that pacify what
kind of vaulting you mean next time Joe
but that's journalism it's journalism
we'll be talking more about gaming
journalism shortly but for now oculus
rift is catching up with survive it's
catching up with vibe on steam valves
recent steam survey shows that rift
market share has bumped up 8.1% in one
month which is pretty huge and you could
say that steam survey
it reveals oculus rift gaining steam
okay right there I'm gonna cut myself
off before I hurt myself current score
is a rift nothing and you have something
to contribute to that no nothing
planning that's worth saying out loud
yeah see at least you can catch yourself
before you say the thing is dream in
front of a live audience of hundreds of
people is currently the score is rift at
forty three point eight percent market
share with the vibe at fifty two point
three that's down the vibe is down seven
point seven percent compared to July
which is a big hit this closing gap
could be attributed to a significant
price drop with the rift to summer sale
for they what's the other three percent
three point nine percent of the market I
was about to say that's not full fully a
hundred percent is it no it's not I
already did the math three point nine
percent season the remainder is there a
third the three point yeah three point
one percent is there the first point
nine three point nine there must be a
third competitor or that's all the
people playing or the journalists team
games on their Samsung VR what is the
Samsung thing called Samsung gear VR the
gear VR with a Google daydream headset
or or Fraser Brown doesn't know how to
math and that goes back to my original
statement which we should boycott all
the articles from Fraser Brown it's like
every article you discuss in never read
anything from this person again
no no she thanked them for I'm over
losing all this research wholly using
these articles from these people because
I respect them okay
and we expect more we expect more yeah
yeah okay it's Frasier I'm only
disappointed because I know what you're
capable of
our student valedictorian all right as
we mentioned last month HTC is
struggling we're struggling they're
considering selling their about their VR
empire and stuff like that because they
took a 513 million dollar loss I
shouldn't be lying that's terrible 513
million dollar lives the vibe got out to
a good start because they they beat the
Rif to the market by a decent amount but
you know I guess it just goes to show
that the tie-in was steam the I mean at
the time misty but the the accessibility
for price and then I guess probably
maybe the accessibility for like motion
to since it's not full room you know you
can do it with with the with the rift
now but right it's easier to get into VR
and not you don't need a full room to
set up like you do with the Bible yeah
I'm saying true I think also maybe
oculus seems to be getting some pretty
decent games lately I feel like more
like bigger budget games have been
hitting the rift more so than buying
I've still sort of in the indie phase I
think where there's like indie
developers making cool little games that
aren't really fully polished and things
like that whereas rift is really
starting to see some did you check the
closer to triple-a content you check the
60fp xbox I did I it's one of those like
I'm on automation type things so
sometimes it's hardware 43 on you're
like I don't know why 43 is still there
it should have been gone a long time ago
here ingestion settings it probably
doesn't matter if I do it now does it
probably not but who knows yeah who
knows maybe it's just maybe doesn't
broken killed your stream eats its gonna
die alright or maybe we just switched
midstream I have no idea at any rate
yeah good luck - vive congrats to oculus
for
yes but more on that later enormous
enormous response after a game
journalists failed miserably at playing
a demo during games calm it was the
cuphead demo a game called cuphead
that's a 2d side-scrolling game 2d
platformer and this is from gamer de mer
revolution calm the article but the the
game journalist in question we're
talking about today is dean takashi the
lead writer for games beat also part of
VentureBeat he does laughably bad at the
cuphead demo failing even the simplest
of tasks so Paul maybe you could play
the there might be a video attached down
to the bottom there we go
so you can see here that he's just he's
just now getting he's just in the
tutorial this is just the tutorial so
duck alright hold down to crouch he got
that a jump so you got the jumping no
problem now he needs to do a jump and
dash to get over this this little
obstacle here which takes him to jump on
top of this block
ah see see the average Joe would have
figured this out immediately go on the
block but poor Dean Takashi I figured it
out seeming to know you would think you
would think he's figured it out but it
takes him quite a long time to to just
get over this this is literally the
twenty six minute video we should watch
the whole thing fortunately he's
crowding unfortunately it's not just 26
minutes of this but it is 26 minutes of
really painful hard to watch moments of
this game journalist this professional
game journalist struggling to to play
what seems to be a fairly simple simple
game I want to see what he shoots what's
he gonna shoot when he gets to the
shooting part yeah I mean Dena killing
me yeah Dean Dean struggles here he
admits openly that he is not good at
this game in the article that he wrote
attached to this video yeah he's
starting to figure he's putting things
together push one button wrong way and
then the other but there's only two ways
to go so he knows it's not the left so
it's gotta be right all right we're
getting real close here oh so warm
you burn it up Dean you were hot come on
or hot you work daddy brothers MLG I
think he does this work and she
relatively easily
you know nothing nothing too bad here
that's a translates in the name right
okay the whole left and right situation
Ken are we going left are we going right
there we go hey all right so it's just
it's just 26 minutes of this okay we
kind of get the point here but more
importantly this sort of sparked a huge
conversation or reignited I should say
the conversation about game journalists
sucking in video games and what's the
deal with that do they have in fact on
Twitter and a fellow game journalist
from the Daily Caller Ian my Ian miles
Chun clipped the opening segment of the
video and he included the caption danger
duelists are incredibly bad at video
games it's painful to watch this how do
they think they're qualified to write
about games this one tweet received over
30,000 interactions and a lot of
responses condemning game journalism as
a whole and so this kind of opens up a
discussion right is it really fair or
justified for the entire Internet to
make this generalization that all of
game journalism is flawed and stupid
because of these very few examples of
game journalists sucking at video games
yep I've written it off nah it's pretty
it's pretty easy for any any of us to
just sort of like you know be like hey
look this was one guy playing one video
game maybe he was having an off day nope
it's all game journalists it's not
necessarily the general suck it's not a
generalization it's like one you know
one person of a certain race did
something bad and now all of a sudden
everyone who belongs to that race hey
that's racism this is there's there's
certain overlapping issues with with
this generalization not all over
generally not all racists are bad at
video games Kyle that is a gross
generalization and I am offended you're
gross you're gross right now you stop
being offended right this
so I don't know but but while it's
pretty easy for a lot of us to see like
okay we can't just generalize it does it
does beg the question should Game
Journalists be good at gaming or if you
are a really really bad gamer does that
disqualify you as being a good game
journalist can you still be a good can
you still write about games effectively
and meaningfully to the masses while
being a terrible terrible terribly
skilled gamer I think that's a question
you should have some level of gaming
prowess you don't need to be top-tier
you don't need to be the best of the
best because if you're writing about
games probably you're gonna write
towards the center of the market where
most people are and most people are okay
again yes right most people can get by
it one's interested in game but you've
at least got to be in the middle of that
hump you know as far as like your
terrible gamers and your best gamers you
know you got to be in the middle of that
bell curve yeah if you're too far to one
side that's like how yeah like how can
you really could seek exactly the
gameplay or like you know how how the
controls or anything like that if you
fail to grasp them yourself exactly yeah
I feel like there's a certain certain
level of understanding between that
needs to happen between the game
developer and the gamer right the game
the game developer has programmed the
game a certain way and has allowed
hopefully allowed the gamer to figure
out different mechanisms of the game and
how they work and if you can't as a
writer specifically as a journalist of
games if you cannot figure out those
mechanisms in a way it kind of defeats
your ability to critique the game
meaningfully I'm like oh this game sucks
you can't even jump over short obstacles
like no you just suck yeah so I think
there's there's obviously room here I
feel like for parody or for comedy this
is a comedy opportunity I think because
it's clearly hilarious watching anyone
trying to play a game and fail at doing
the most mundane simple tasks so maybe
it could be like a parody or like a
comedy review where it's like hey we
took my 19 year old grandmother and had
her play battlefield
this was her review right obviously and
that's more just for entertainment slash
comedy but if it's a meaningful review I
feel like there is basically what Paul
is saying you kind of have to be okay
at games at the very least okay and
according to Dean Takahashi he was just
having a really off day and just did not
resonate with this game for whatever
reason I mean it's possible there are
certain games that I feel like the
majority of people are okay at and I'm
just for whatever reason I mean yes
except instead of a head it's very
confusing perplex all right so you guys
let us know what you think in chat
speaking of games speaking of games
we've got another one that Paul and I
are actually gonna play ourselves
probably fail miserably at ourselves
like justed really why did you post that
story perfect right before we both play
game I'm bad at scheduling as an example
of us being probably hypocrites all
right so we're gonna play face-off we're
going we're gonna do some face-off here
which is a new singer not a new segment
you know a segment segment to the show
as it's a met watch oh god can fix this
I can fix this don't hassle the hoff
Paul there we go oh that wasn't shown
yes faceoff is a is where Paul and I go
head-to-head in a crappy two-player
online game and the loser has to do
something stupid or embarrassing or
funny all the above perhaps actually
have not picked out a punishment for
today so if you guys have any
suggestions on what the loser
aka Paul will have to do at the end of
this I don't always go ahead and blow a
win sometimes block chat that's true
yeah that's true whatever you say
whatever you say Paul wait well what's
going on with the YouTube chat right now
I don't know as Lugar I think it has
something to do with the fact that
you're the owner of the channel it's
like it's highlighting yeah from
important people right and people who
give you money and all of the
unimportant people is just this like
like the words social commentary the
games have said don't matter I don't
know why though but there's some like
highlights when your name but let's go
up there there's somebody who wrote
something yeah no donation but he you
can clearly read everyone else has
blocked out and look at emoji this emoji
guy just very strange I don't understand
no sorry guys I can't read your comments
in YouTube unless you touch money to it
continue doing that alright so I'm gonna
say wait so so really quick before we
before we dive in our good friend and
moderator self processing is out of town
for today so he is not in chat he's dead
to us he's enjoying PAX West with some
friends and stuff so hopefully he's
having a good time there but we do have
spider fan spider fan a spider you are
our worst case scenario backup moderator
and for that we love and respect you
okay so much you're a favorite that's
been your favorite any time sells done
we like spider super cool for being a
younger kid he is super awesome I can
see myself hanging out with in IRL so
thank you very much spider fan if you
could maybe source any potential ideas
that look good to you for punishments
for for this segment
and either messages privately or you
know in chat when we ask you that'd be
awesome so we don't have to sift through
everything I'm good to be the backup he
says awesome we're glad you're here
spider we really are so let's go ahead
and dive into this terrible game that I
found it's basically online foosball
it's called I'm amazed ball booty I'm a
foodie which clearly means foosball in
Guatemala I don't know but yeah y'all
know how foosball works right it's
basically like FIFA it's like FIFA 2017
or soccer manager 2018 player to SWS you
know if these are real games I'm talking
about right so so it's it's only two
motions I'm gonna be two keys I'm gonna
be player 1 up down and you're gonna be
player 2 wws
maybe I don't know okay but the the
dudes kick the ball automatically I'm
red
they'll kick the ball automatically
alright so how did you even call that
the transition food Wow we call that Wow
Wow - nothing nothing
nothing but net oh Jesus jeez jeez
that's chaos in the middle that was WOW
all right oh my balls Exide balls but
should we plan to fire we just plain to
fire oh yeah I'll split five five that
Wu's cheating just skill he'll cheat it
here comes the David Beckham whoa whoa
okay the David Beckham taking a nap
maybe here is tearing up his bed
turn it up okay oh damn the side saw
that coming she said all right wait what
what do what's this Corey no I can't
even look thick we're tied look how
you're doing this Wow
you just went up oh boy this is game
point for me
game point any more attention alright
let's let's do two out of three that was
too quick let's do two or three so I
have one that's up one you win one more
this is come on this is this is like I
like this over a regular foosball
because it doesn't high and I don't I'm
I'm actually pretty good at regular
foosball and that's not related I
thought that was gonna translate like
I'm good at Superman he's at it alright
I'm super I'm good at Super Monkey Ball
go and of Tiger Woods super what Super
Monkey Ball golf game on thank you geez
that's your childhood okay old man old
man I didn't do a lot of GameCube gaming
at least that was the time of my life
when I wasn't playing many games
Thompson I'm just so cool calm you're so
cool
that's a nice block goalie that's a nice
block okay okay this that's quite the
stalemate here yep wonder are we losing
viewers yeah
show me your worst I don't think so okay
cool I think they're into it good good
everyone
no probably doing nasty things to this
the goal come on so this is basically a
fight between AMD and Intel because
we're red and blue right okay so I'm
Andy what are you there we go you use
the power we get home for team red use
the power of a 3-1 in this in this match
right now
he's power of rising see that was the
color that chat the thread Ripper I'm
using my price to performance yeah nice
to performance kind of metrics again
well you know this is unexpected price
likes here we come
I'm gonna ambush you with terrible
prices with aqua suns for all the all
the juice all the marks every single one
no that's a terrible strain yeah that's
a really really bad start post oh wow
Wow apparently Cal has been sandbagging
so no time to bust out the real skills
oh oh look at that goalie uh-oh MVP
right there and I wonder why I didn't
dude kick it when he was three nothing
you just got this is not from across the
coffee lake
as there wasn't from the back wheel to
the front field I don't know what that
actual term is this is this is match
blender come to sky like Xu out no no
you could have thread RIPD me ma'am
button else I guess Intel wins now and
tell us better
Sherman's now it's not all debates
should be decided sure I'm glad we
didn't have a push button
decided for that one but since I lost Oh
No
oh there will be punishments all right
well yes right well so there's also all
right there's also sushi later on so
let's move on yes true your true all
right then my PC let's go well while we
figure out the punishment
what if you just chug a beer I write a
beer yeah I can chug a beer
I'll chug your frickin beer don't move
if I'm gonna pound it I'll go for the
New Castle please I feel like that's us
I mean there but it's a it's a brown ale
versus a well give me two that and give
me a little something as well though for
after the New Castle three years it's
done
all right next up is our by PC Kyle
earlier actually very late today just
before the show since a tweet out and
people sent pictures of their computers
and we're going to show you those
pictures and then we're going to
critique them mainly from an aesthetic
perspective I will try to give some some
good advice when we can or if not we'll
just say why did you do that yeah bottle
opener is
have so many various implements for
opening bottles things you didn't see
magazines
let's take this first computer while I
get this ready and then I'll pound but
first is from Giuseppe Cosentino he's
living in Italy so he can't watch the
show live but here is his pic my PC he
also did a piece bin which I don't know
if I'm gonna be able watch that's some
clean cable management right there yes
it looks pretty it does even the flat
PCIe cable looks like it's just bent
backwards in perfect shape yeah oh wait
yes you do
what's interesting here is if the rear
fan is actually set to intake that is
interesting so unless you have a dust
filter on the back or something he's
just trying to stay positive
yeah hahaha ah I see what you did there
okay sure
yeah that's that's interesting I wonder
if that was intentional maybe you did
some a be testing yourself who knows I
would say I do like via the gold accents
on the motherboards fairly unique it's
kind of a mishmash of colors here red
blue and gold
if you're trying to go for like a
patriotic gold rush beam which I don't
really a theme I don't mind the red
black and gold here but I do feel like
the LEDs on the front
don't don't match up quite as well
exactly yeah as far as that goes I just
get some more grey fans or something or
yeah or kill the LEDs maybe
I don't know or red LED fans might might
work maybe right maybe some of those
fantex
what is it the fantex halos you know
yeah the hills are pretty cool I mean
the is they're they're like 10 or 15
bucks each depending on which one you
get the shrew we always say this that
typically and inside of a case it looks
aesthetically pleasing when all the fans
in the case are uniformed when they can
be um so bear that in mind I gotta give
high praise here for your 24 pin your
USB 3 of course the the PCI Express
graphics and then your SATA cable see
just like the super straight yeah
they're so straight yeah that's they are
it's very nice it's very satisfying I
will say so you good job Dave Giuseppe
gives me a hard-on I will also say um
maybe pulling this Intel Ethernet
sticker off of here that's also not
really blending in as much as you
believe maybe he gun that up right of
course you're gonna need to get in there
and remove some stuff so that may or may
not be worth your time depending on
whether or not you're playing and
reconfiguring this system at all
the very nice job with the cable
management they're just heavy yep thanks
Giuseppe time for me to pop my beer do
it
choose thanks for being here guys Gerry
this will make my half of the show a
little bit more entertaining st. Paul
let's see it Paul it Wow that was a very
impressive chug we need to start timing
things because I feel like we're bound
to set some world records at some point
well well well done well done thank you
absolutely whoo someone someone clip
that I got something that my college
education
someone clip that and send it to me so I
can make it my my my default wallpaper

last year while all right next up we've
got Gianna Mike we'll call you Mike
agenda call you Mike
can't install two more tried in RGB
because clearance help RGB monstrosity
eight extreme GTX 1070 founders Edition
7700 K and a 780 T piece interesting he
can't install the RGB Ram because of
clearance what kind of clearance issues
maybe with weird yeah I've seen that
happen you probably can you just it
would be like if it would push against
the memory and it might even bend it
yeah push it over a little bit so they
don't watch all sorry Mike which would
suck yeah uh and it doesn't look good if
you rotate that water block in
particular I feel like it just it looks
best in a good default position you have
it it's really I I really like how these
cable extensions look they do they look
great yeah I mean they're super break
well I mean they stand out but I don't
think they like they think they go you
know yeah do you I like how the one half
of the rainbow from the ultraviolet side
is represented in the graphics card one
well whereas the other side on the
infrared side as represented by the
eight pin CPU instead I began like
you've eaten right so UV and on the
pilot side right and how they splitter
blue green down yeah and then yeah that
was pretty cool
yeah well well thought out and it's like
there's also the trainings really nice
to you is this no and they're not even
extension is there straight from the
power sides yes
so those are definitely a custom job
honestly I feel like I would run wild
with this I mean you've already got
these cables that are super unique go
crazy with more RGB everything I think I
feel like it like the cables are almost
too much too colorful for the rest of
the bill
if that would be my only critique maybe
throw in some RGB LED strips if you
haven't yet and NZXT hue plus would be
pretty sweet is that that's that's a
Wi-Fi that's a wife he has a Wi-Fi
antenna inside of his case huh that's
interesting
that is interesting I wonder if I wonder
if that works better for you or
something like that but does a side
panel it says lirikh lirikh lirikh
that's kind of cool I like I like custom
decals on cases if they're done right
that's pretty clean honestly man there's
not much to say here other than keep up
the good work and you know if there's
one thing about the system that I like
the least is probably the stock GTX what
is that instead of 1070
yeah the founders edition it's fine it's
fine though you're wrong I'm justified
to pick one thing out it's that's the
thing that stands out to me is not being
as sort of unique as the rest of the
system yeah all right next up is Hawk
1291 hole 7600 K based system color
master master liquid light 128 susi 170
AR 16 gigs of 3200 vengence LED memory
an XFX r9 380 4 gig senator 50 watt
course sir our max power supply 1
terabyte her drive NZXT s340 elite black
ha all right so um PCBs around PCB do
not I do not like brown PCB yeah mostly
it's it's distracting
yeah it's all I see it's all I can see
I'm seeing Brown I mean so this this
case could really do with them like I
have one of my wife's big makeup brushes
that I use to dust things and that lets
you get up on PCBs and up into corners
and stuff like that because yeah you can
see there's been some dusting going on
the area above the power supply tray
down there at the bottom or power supply
you know the basement has it has been
dusted off a little bit yeah but not
very thoroughly you know so yeah it
needs a good dusting I agree kale
management is it's fine yeah
with free solid you know you know it's
really good actually
I would say that apart from swapping out
the motherboard later down the line and
dusting I don't know I feel like I feel
like the system could use a bit more
personality I mean this is 7600 K on a
z170 motherboard so like maybe maybe a
motherboard upgrade maybe a Z 270 with a
little bit more personality and and
maybe some some lighting on it or
whatever if you wanted to make things
look a little bit fancier in there
because you do have led memory so
obviously you're not like anti LED you
know but yeah maybe something like that
I think would would spice things up a
little bit other than that I mean you
got solid cable management and a nice
pretty much monochrome build so yeah
looks fine yeah what's good
all right next up we've got debbie de
Brian what date oh no I didn't open it
maybe Brian - well we got Brian as well
but we're sitting brain for last but we
can do Brian now if you want no let's
let's do these all right we'll do brain
for life I never opened them okay let's
do David
David with the Strix is e27 te a 7700 K
based system and the GTX 10-8 all right
all right okay um let's see cable
management looks a little hairy towards
the bottom it's like the power supply
it's a little rough and tumble there
yeah looks like a little haystacks
awesome looks like your supplemental CPU
power is running under your graphics
card up and around your CPU socket and
everything and then over to where that
actually plugs in am I wrong about that
yeah no yeah yeah that's interesting it
looks like you've got some behind the
motherboard capability here for routing
that yeah you should yeah so thousand a
huge cable that would be a good thing to
route behind the motherboard right you
can rotate this CPU fan your cry rig fan
here you could rotate that 90 or
80 degrees to get that cable down
towards the motherboard and tucked away
a little bit better what else you've got
an old-school red to SATA cable for your
optical drive does that bother you Kyle
I rounded cleaner yeah I wouldn't mind
since you've got the red on the under
graphics card that's not that that
matches up okay there is this does have
a graphics card support right here you
know clear acrylic GeForce GTX one which
looks nice that doesn't look bad and
SSDs just kind of chillin on top of that
that's just kind of laying there no hay
has a mount or something like that for
two-and-a-half inch drives so what
appears to be maybe a fan splitter or
something like that going on down here
at the bottom that's just kind of
hanging out in there so yeah it looks
like there is some space behind the
motherboard tray here but yeah there's
just there's there's a fair amount of
cable management that could go on here
that can make things look a lot cleaner
I think yeah other than that I mean your
equipments all all pretty solid so you
have complaints there but yeah a better
solution for mounting that SSD though
yeah right on top of the hard drive is
just there's better places you can put
it mm-hmm
probably not at risk of like you know
killing a drive or anything like that
but it's just it's nice just to lock
down your components you never know when
your systems gonna get thrown around or
you can get
moved and stuff I agree goodbye let's
move on to the next one Brandon tech
prendick g1 sniper 5 on AI 74770 kasich
thing gigs of course a memory a 980ti
amped extreme see sonic 1050 watt power
supply samsung 950 SSD - corsair 90 gigs
and raid 0 so several assist is in this
build
ok wow that is a unique combination of
colors yeah brown lime-green several
different shades of green yep get some
LEDs on the motherboard the the blue
this is vengeance I believe this Corsair
Vengeance memory I've seen this blue kit
you you had this blue kitten and one
here for it but it looks almost
turquoise kind of because of the other
green components hmm maybe you've also
got some Noctua fans with retina Brown
corners on them right so clearly there's
a color coordination mush mishmash going
on here which it's difficult to say how
exactly you could solve that you can't
change any well I guess you could change
the motherboard but yeah I don't know I
think I feel like mmm those three colors
don't match at all like the green blue
and brown aren't really doing it for me
I feel like if I was given this bill by
someone for free or something like that
I'd probably spit in their face be like
why they destroyed that smashed the
computer on their head
no um I'd probably spray paint the
corners of the fans cuz they're still
living there knocked it was a really
good fan back to uh cells replacement
corner kits that you can swap out and
get colors I mean it's better if you
want to go that far just about the
quarters and there's nothing you can do
about this hideous lime green on the
motherboard so you're either gonna need
to swap your motherboard cuz it's look
it's on the PCIe slots I don't think
it's hideous though I think if it was
paired nicely or just only hope it was
the accent color then yeah so if you
want to go with that as your accent
color then yeah but green LEDs this is
one this is the thing this is one of my
kind of pet peeves stable to LEDs you've
got green LEDs which I'm having a
trouble mousing over because of the
but yet the green LEDs down here
audience with our different color green
then the green on the motherboard that's
I don't like that you know I don't think
that Matt I'd rather not have the LEDs
yeah disabled yeah so let's able disable
those you're my os-- in the BIOS or
through software or something like that
I totally agree with Paul different
shades of the same color do not always
look the best or if they do they have to
be done right but it's possible there's
some yellow on top of this graphics card
we can't see as well oh yeah it's just I
forget as one of those texts less likely
well the back plate remove easily spray
paint a bowl if you wanted to go that
route so there's no there's no easy
solution to this to aesthetically you
know but apart from the aesthetics I
mean your cable management solid
everything everything looks fine
functionally so yeah just ignore what we
say and keep me using your computer we
don't we don't really know
all right Briley shout out to Brian from
VPS customs man he he he actually
submitted this PC to put my PC today
because he's ridiculous and he knows
that this PC is clearly not in any way
shape or form in need of any sort of
critiques look at all this because it's
just so beautiful I've always I really
wanted to do a build in this case in win
three oh no three 305 305 305 was to go
to a 302 301 301 in England via one it's
a very unique case it's right up there
above the 300 somewhere yeah
it looks looks really good all around
Brian I'm assuming that position
revealed I'm pretty here it is he's
asking if we should if I should add RGB
dims I say yes I say all right so
Corsair Vengeance LED in blue do it yeah
I'd look good if the I would rather the
LEDs were just the same colors as the
fans and not RGB to be honest yeah yeah
I mean you could get our GB and set them
to that color right or the standard
Corsair white LED dins
might not match quite as well so yeah
you kind of want that ice blue color
and you thought that ice blue color yep
so either finds dims that have that like
out of the box or maybe maybe consider
dropping you know do you Brian you
you've you've got G skills tried NZ kit
right you know the are did you drop it
in there and try some color
configurations and see if it you can get
it to match up is that I think that
would look nice and you'd have lots of
lights in the case and a little bit more
light right here in the middle what
light is a little dark in this area
that's not the Inland 301 that I was
thinking about what is it is it because
it doesn't have a fan mounts are you
right honeycomb it's supposed to have
that huh it is an in one case though
absolutely somewhat enchant has most
definitely corrected me at this point I
have to talk to Andy at some point
people are saying 301 301 oh that's the
new 101 someone said it's the new
one-on-one that's it's okay sure fine by
me can't keep up with all these cases
yeah and multiple people were saying is
the 101 well cool that's that's a fun
case I want to build on that one now
screw the 301 but thank you very much
Brian for making awesome pcs and
submitting it to pay my PC today
thanks man let's move on to our last
segment here we're gonna plow through
these news stories because we are short
on time people devour your Bower
world-famous overclocker professional
overclocked er has deleted Intel's 12 up
to their 18 core skylake ex CPUs article
from overclocked 3d dotnet he used his
own deleting tool of course which is
clearly going to be working on the
latest scalex scaley ex offerings the
new reveal after deleting shows us that
they died on a skylake X high core count
part is significantly larger than the
lower core counterparts like the 10
cores and lower the die size is just
significantly larger just from a
physical standpoint the CPU also appears
to be unsoldered okay so we are still
waiting on
devours video which
we'll be detailing the deleting process
that he went through
also perhaps to promote his deleting
tool which is the deal it'd die made our
deal it'd dime 8 X I like how he just
threw X at the ending this extra extra
Tim no like no it's that it's like to
there's to PCBs like it so I could
double substrate this yeah that's
interesting yeah I don't know to make of
it but hopefully de Barra can shed some
more light in his upcoming video so
thanks to Bauer for deleting things that
we can't moving on RX Vega 64 has
apparently been able to smoke Polaris in
etherium mining efficiency this is an
article from hot hardware calm thing
we're following the the activities of
one such redditor by the name of silent
death
it's all in leet speak but silent death
has optimized his Vegas 64 card to have
a hash rate of 43 point 5 mega hashes
per second that's a lot apparently
I don't know what a regular Vega 64 goes
for like your 580 s will do around 30 ok
so then that is that is pretty good
actually forty three point five so yeah
and and this is like the follow-up as
people have explored more of the power
efficiency capabilities of Vega and it's
something that AMD could have spoken
pretty highly of the problem is when you
enable all the power efficiency features
of Vega you can't necessarily run at
frequencies that make it competitive
with Intel's offerings like at 1070
versus videos on Vega 56 or a 1080
versus the Vega 64 however there are
some really good balances as far as the
amount of GPU power that you get out
versus the amount of power that the chip
actually draws and there's a bunch of
really cool power saving features that
can be implemented with Vega so yeah I
not surprised at this at all yeah
initially there was all these early
rumors like that they're gonna see 60 or
80 or 100 mega hash per second
performance Atta Vega and that those are
all obviously false but miners don't
necessarily can't care about what's the
peak you know performance you can get
out of this graphics card it's what's
the best performance you can get at the
lowest power drop I am so this is good
news for miners and bad news for anyone
who wanted to buy a Vegas video card for
gaming because this certainly is it
going to make them more more available
right on the market it's it means there
that they are yes a desirable mining
card so our worst fear for miners worst
fear for gamers what's interesting also
is that apparently this redditor wasn't
even using the the mining optimized
driver from AMD he was using just a real
of edition driver 17 8.2 okay he was
noting stability issues with the mining
driver actually so perhaps it just
hasn't fully matured yet so all that
said good luck getting a Vegas 64 or a
Vega 56 card now as if it wasn't
difficult enough already
miners probably now have their sights
set on new rx series they weren't there
were in Vegas if T sixes this past week
available at retail for the promised
price of $399 they all sold out very
very quickly but some people bought them
take it 56 right yeah yeah some some
people bought them yeah they were a
thing they did so up I mean they were
there at least long enough to five
minutes clear AMD if any legal
responsibility for claiming that they
would be available for that price yeah
but yeah so grats to anyone who didn't
who did jump on one of those cuz of Iggy
56 for 400 bucks gaming or mining is a
pretty good card yeah yeah let's move on
to our next story here AMD has has
actually surpassed Intel in
CPU sales at Europe's biggest PC market
haha this is an article from did you
worthy calm this is the first time in
over a decade that AMD has trumped Intel
when it comes to CPU sales and revenue
this is that journeys largest online
retailer minefactory dot de one easy to
read graph yeah it's it's a little
confusing
I took a gander and it was like nope
ain't nobody got time for that but you
guys can figure it out so props to Rison
and thread Ripper the year they are the
big proponents of of this of this
milestone this achievement that AMD has
as a has acquired AMD only had 28% of
the cpu market share when Rison first
launched back in march and then it
reached 49% four months later and then
just in august it finally passed Intel
with over 56 percent market share
effectively doubling its sales at the
Germany tailor in just half a year so
Bravo indeed that's that's very awesome
news I'm sure you guys are super excited
about that there and then as market
share the right term that might not be
the right term to use um just well
market share within this one website so
this is a global market percentage of
CPUs sold at this website in this period
of time correct just to be clear correct
just because we had yeah I want anyone
to leave this thinking now dominate now
sixty percent of people are using AMD
CPUs but correct it's just what's been
purchased at the site but that is pretty
damn impressive that AMD CPUs are not
just competing with Intel CPUs but
actually out selling them and it's not
too surprising given ya what AMD has has
put out this year they've done a pretty
damn good job especially in the CPU side
yeah it's kind of crazy because like
it's so different the way that Rison
competes with Intel Core processors
because like
AMD just seems to have a lot more
popular options like a 1,700 or I'm
sorry the 1600 the horizon 5 1600 is one
of the most sold CPUs or bought CPUs on
Amazon right now
just trailing barely behind the 7700 K
which is number one but then they've
also got the risin 7 1700 just after the
1600s which is also just crushing it
right because the 1600 and 1700 are
totally different price points but
they're still both doing very well and
then you've got the you've got 1600 X
and the 1700 X which are trailing just
behind that so AMD kind of has this wide
range of desirable CPUs very popular
CPUs they have several popular CPUs
whereas Intel at least in the mainstream
sector really only has like the 7700 K
and I guess the 7600 K but even that
like the 7600 K has been trailing off
because people want hyper threading or
SMT or whatever so really actually
according to the article the 7700 K
accounts for nearly half of Intel's
desktop unit sales which is pretty crazy
whereas with AMD it's completely spread
out across multiple SKUs which is kind
of interesting I think it shows that AMD
did a really good job with positioning
and pricing and segmentation of the rise
and lunch absolutely because they they
hit Intel multiple different levels and
I mean you go anywhere and people in
people are talking about building a
gaming PC or workstation PC or like a
budget whatever PC right ends you know
if there's there's certain prices and
use cases that you can say yeah this
Intel CPU makes sense but there's a lot
more I think at this point that you that
you have to say actually you'll be
better off with Rison yeah for that so
there you go alright and finally our
last story of this half of the show is
about gigabyte and their other brand new
GT x 1080 which is actually now the
world's smallest GTX anything you can
find on the market
tiny so cute this is the GTX 1080 Mini
ITX 8g measuring in at just a hundred
and sixty nine millimeters in length all
right for the record 169 millimetres
Mini ITX motherboards are only a hug
seventy millimeters wide so this is
actually perfect for those cases like
the like all the Kickstarter cases that
are popping up that are ITX and just
barely big enough like you know that are
only the width of the Mini ITX
motherboard um so really you could only
fit in the card like this so that's
actually pretty cool the previous title
holder for world's smallest gtx 980 was
ZOTAC with with their card weighing in
at 211 millimeters so this shaves off
the good 40 or so millimeters of length
however the height of this card is a bit
longer or a bit Toleration say than the
standard PCIe height and that just kind
of it's due to the fact that the heat
dissipation has to take place somewhere
if they're making the card really short
and you got these cutting paper coming
up to get a little bit longer get a
little bit more dissipation out of it a
little bit more heat absorption which is
why you can see right there as Paul's
indicating that the card is it taller
than a standard PCIe slot so it's not
gonna fit or I should say it will fit in
most cases still I feel like height is
not nearly as much of an issue as length
when it comes to graphics cards and
compatibility with cases so in most
cases this should fit just fine I can
verify that this card fits in the note
202 because it looks to have the exact
same shroud and cooler as as gigabytes
gtx 1070 mini which was in the go
anywhere pc go anywhere do anything pc
that i built a while back so it's
definitely flexible can fit in many
tight spaces that's what she said it
features a single 8 pin PCIe connector
has a basement boost clock factory
overclocked of course of sixteen hundred
and thirty-two and seventeen hundred and
seventy one megahertz respectively
definitely some overhead on overclocking
I would imagine eight gigs of gddr5 X
which is pretty sweet of course there
are 1070 mini did not have DVR 5 X
memory this has been the memory itself
even hasn't been factory overclocked
which
been too often to a thousand and ten
megahertz and it features a semi passive
90 millimeter fan just like the gtx 770
mini and zero rpm at idle which is nice
three heat pipes with five plus 2 power
faces the article does mention that AMD
for what it's worth is also teasing
their Vega nano I haven't heard much
about big a nano they've been teasing a
little bit no word on release date or if
it's gonna be able to trump a mini GT X
1080 in the small form-factor realm
there's also no price on the the
gigabyte GT X 1080 here but it is
according to the article speculated to
be around $600 us which is a lot but
that's the price you pay for small a
nice small form-factor very very small
things yes indeed so that's gonna do it
for my half the show ladies and
gentlemen let's quickly go down some of
the yeah you forgotten cells not here
cell is not here so we do not have any
leads how do we look at the nation
comments and cells oh yes so you can try
to pull up your super check yes in the
middle Johnson's I'm gonna do some
Johnson's I have I have three no wait
right yeah now I got two yes I've to
Johnson's to Johnson's first Johnson is
for Christopher thank you so much
Christopher from Ohio for grabbing the
thumbscrews shirt and I also have a
Johnson for Brandon and I've got the
zero insertion force shirt always the
classic Thank You Brandon from Kentucky
for your support your patronage hope you
enjoy those products should be on their
way to you very soon you don't know that
super chat work community super chat
found it you found it found it it's
under community yep under community
super check okay alright yeah
so here we go change from all live
streams
this one this one yeah beautiful okay we
are good because we don't even need sell
sells obsolete sell you're fired
I'm just kidding solid all right gilben
M hi you Kai hi Paul
thanks for the thank you comment in the
donation bump Corsa NL pro or NZXT err
RGB case fans for Astrix x 370 in a
mission Phi C build worried the RGB will
be too muted behind the tinted tempered
glass it is a fairly tinted side panel I
will say messy Phi C is fairly tinted
which is great for some people terrible
for others I feel like if you really
want to accentuate the lighting in your
in your case then back it up with some
RGB strips and all the other RGB
you can it's good if you can find strips
that are you know have adjustable
brightness and things like that you can
crank it up as as needed but yes be
aware that mesh if IC does have a
heavily tinted side panel window
Fred rant for the 5 bucks valid house PC
build and slogan tiles PC building
slogan and I quote build on a boat if it
does not fit force it if it breaks it
needed replacement anyways that is
exactly that was exactly my approach
frills are done for the yacht belt thank
you very much Fred Fred again for
another five dollar donation never let
Kyle build a PC on a boat again yeah
that's that's pretty much a given I'm
pretty sure frankly Josh will say
otherwise though we do even crazier
Christopher Calvary for the five bucks
hey Kyle thanks to your boat vid I
learned my motherboard won't fit in my
petrify C just kidding I did my research
that's embarrassing lol but for the
awesome bid Thank You Christopher yeah
that was something that clearly as all
of you already know I learned the hard
way
Fred rant against top donated Fred it
was nice when you just gave us $100 all
in one go yeah you're breaking up the
hundred dollars that's into $25 donation
longer Fred ran did you take wife you
saw us out to dinner like you were
supposed to with the money from last
week earth yes yes yes dad would expect
her to hold up hold you to that ask her
no don't ask
no don't ask I the place I want to take
take her to is so nice that reservations
to save that money up five months okay
Nick Duncan five dollars what's up guys
been a frequent viewers sharing the love
thank you very much thank we appreciate
your donations checkered tile lol wish I
could stay
got school though love y'all yeah school
sucks just wait till you're out of
school though then life and you'll wish
you were in school life will suck
Michael Anthony are you excited for
mobile augmented reality I was never
really excited for regular augmented
reality so I can't say I'm excited for
mobile yep I just don't have time DV
child keep an eye out for the ten dollar
donation won't be able to donate as
often as I used to
schools back in session and I won't be
able to watch arrive as often because of
my crass sketch rarer I know I don't
have to but Iraq to okay
keep up the good work thank you very
much Stevie thank you you are a trooper
tried and true fan of the show I really
do appreciate all of your contributions
Sam bloom for the one bottle at crash
schedule new comment attached thank you
very much Sam blue Sam automatic match
for your automatic $10 donation you
don't I'll what's next PC building
skydiving or being chased around by
drill instructors while building pcs
that's a pretty good ass idea drill
instructors I'll pass that along to Josh
also Paul please give please htpc I've
got 12 days left to watch he only has 12
days left to walk so and he's shipping
out they believe he's going to another
country oh you told us oh yes yes okay
we'll figure it out Matt I'm sorry I'll
at least give you an update we have lots
of things to do El Jefe reviews $5
what's up jefe the boat video was great
surprised Paul wasn't there though
Austin is cool but he's no Paul ah
hashtag get Paul on the boat perhaps
there could be a a giant threesome of
all of us on the next one
who knows who knows what with terrible
things you might be witnessed might be
witnessed but thank you very much chef a
half a picture yes
terming des Jones $10 hey guys me again
been a minute for my 1920 X build I
mentioned to you while previously should
i do gtx 980ti or keep it all AMD and WH
for Vega 56 64 custom cards ok wait wait
yeah yeah you should wait wait I would
say wait I wasn't saying weights that
wasn't ever just saying you said w8 he
meant wait yes I would go to yeah
personally thank you guys more
accessible it's a pretty solid
accessible card right now and yes
according to Nvidia it's not gonna be
beaten by anything at least for the rest
of this year
yep you'd have to wait super long for a
bigger party to come around mm so good
luck on that
Scott Dilbeck for the six dollars and
sixty six cents super metal can we do a
submitted Pip PC run here soon and when
are we touring the flippin new place
Kyle
Jebus it's been weeks party on yes yeah
that's an easy video cap that's an easy
video that I am waiting on one more
vendor to come to to ship their damn
products that I'm waiting on because I
promised them that it would be in the
initial studio tour video and they're
held up right now like literally like
it's like the only thing holding back
that video from coming out but rest
assured that the longer I wait to
produce that video the more put together
and crafted that studio will be when I
present it to you and it'll look awesome
and it'll give you a better
representation of the environment that
