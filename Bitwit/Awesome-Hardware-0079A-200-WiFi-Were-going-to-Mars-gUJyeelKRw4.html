games just gonna be music in the
background the whole time it's alright
though doesn't really matter all right
the only thing I haven't done is tweet
but we should now be live to both - both
live I just tweeted well good I tweeted
I was want to say that in the past and
they almost say a word that's probably
we get flag before we get to monetized I
don't want to do monetize your video
Kyle what I I don't know I farted we're
live on YouTube now oh hey you should
you should introduce the show what's up
YouTube going on alright now that we're
streaming both to both platforms welcome
everybody this is awesome hardware
episode 79 holy crap we're almost at 80
episodes of this shit how's that
possible
yeah I don't know how we got this far
but we did and if you guys are watching
us live thank you very much for tuning
in either on twitch.tv slash an awesome
hardware or our respective youtube
channels we like to break up the show
into two halves on the youtube front so
side a this week is on my my channel
which is youtube.com slash c / bit wit
or you can watch Part B once my half of
the show is over on Paul's channel head
over there
once this half is done at twitch no I'm
sorry youtube.com slash Paul's hardware
and then next week it'll switch side a
will be on Paul's channel first and then
side B on mine it's gonna be after that
let me get four that is it'll be my
channel again and then it'll be yours so
had too much information but but the
week after that will be your channel
first and they made like but like 30
episodes from now will be me first so
you can just do yeah it's just if you
haven't figured it out yet it alternates
every other week we do have an odd
number of shows though somehow we have
an odd number of shows yeah cuz on my
playlist which I diligently update on my
channel we want much better about that
which contains both halves of the show
and not just my own halves to show how
much time have you wasted though by
doing that clicking that extra video yes
I had to playlist it adds up yeah but no
but that playlist has its own love like
what where are we on 79 times two minus
one
yeah this right after me right now right
I can hardly deliver the technique 63
let alone simple arithmetic that's
probably wrong it's probably wrong is
most likely wrong fact checkers fact
checkers get your keyboards ready all
right so why don't we go ahead and kick
things off by trying to sell you things
on our stores that help all proceeds go
to us it's a very charitable cause for
us this is my store bit with tech slash
store where I'm still selling shirts I
do have a couple ideas in mind for
future designs but for now this is what
you're stuck with up at the BIOS flasher
shirt in either a heavy metal gray or
the maroon color both are very popular
the CPU cooler shirt is also doing still
well after all these I guess it's you
know it's a timeless classic timeless
apparently like both the navy blue as
well as the tri-blend are selling very
well lovely state positive shirt as well
is a good feel good shirt and then
Paul's hardware net you can find all of
Paul's merchandise here yes indeed he's
got what's the new stuff that you've
added to your store the newest shirt
which is doing quite well is my standard
ass thumb screw logo in the Tri blends
the grave which is very soft and
comforting and all that good stuff so
that's doing great
also pint glasses as of this past week
are now back in stock so thanks to all
you guys who have purchased those and
hey Cheers tell you guys what happened
to be drinking out of them right now
because lose what we're doing yeah we
except mines empty and so is mine what
in the world this is not awesome
hardware and if somebody fill these cups
yeah I got this IPA specially for Kyle
ah thank you I'm actually very
interested in trying this it is called
easy beaver
it's called easy beaver by the belching
beaver breweries and show them easy
beaver easy beaver I'm sure it tastes
delicious
yes I'm not gonna go any further than
that gentle yes okay whereas I have this
is this is random oh they even say Prost
on the back random special black
lobotomy Bock wish for better for worse
I'm drinking by the way this is 12%
holy shit you're
only what for for oh it's by oven 5% 5%
were in the Lutz's or less than 5% so
yeah this is by Indian Wells Brewing
Company which is local here in Southern
California Indian Wells they have a
casino out there as well oh that was a
terrible court I poured it so slowly it
I poured it's I've never thought ahead
read more of this horrible this is a
double Bock with a guy Laver and good
stuff anyway well it's not like some
good hair to do it to start youngest the
chosen beaver yeah all right
so that's good I mean I'm glad mines
only four point seven percent alcohol
because I do have to drive home later
tonight
later on after you've sobered up yes
hopefully I don't lose today's faceoff
because that will require a drinking
punishment they did the opposite of you
have no head 0 eyes this is see if I
could get you some head ok just Cal how
about this beer I get in the glass he
has some of that good that good luck
right there just last pass someone over
yeah alright Cheers
yeah needs to get oh goodness
that is complex it goes down easy like
you Nancy Beaver shoes si I PA it's
pretty tasty good yep
well that's good approved all right
let's go and now proceed to our first
segment of today's show which is hails
from space that we're starting off start
laughing space may seem like third
dimension or something because usually
tales from space yes a second I've done
Paul's channel or impulse after the show
excuse me but today we're doing a little
bit difference because I sort of got a
late start on today's show on prepping
and stuff finding stories and Paul was
gracious enough to lend me that segment
well there's good interesting news from
space today especially if you follow
SpaceX yes actually that's the only
story I have for this segment so I
really oh oh real quickly forget holy
shit real quick this is not tales from
space this is tales from here which
Conesus coming weekends we're going to
be doing a fan meetup at the Tipsy crow
I will be there I will be there Luke
from Linus media group will be there
Steve our good friend as well we'll be
there and there's gonna be lots of other
people as well yeah Josh good ol fractal
josh has been organizing this so click
link in the description if you're going
to go to twitchcon and perhaps you can
join up with us it is 21 and over and
there's a $5 cover charge there was a
limited range of options for where we
might have this meetup so this seemed to
be the best option we're gonna be going
to the Kingston party right after the
HyperX party and then we're gonna try to
set up something at twitchcon or
something there for people who aren't
over 21 who might also want to do a
meet-up as well alright oh can I make it
really quick announcement as well no ok
ok no yes you can I check on just really
quick I am planning a livestream bill
yeah
the day before twitchcon so I'm actually
two days from now on Thursday at 7 p.m.
Pacific on my youtube channel as well as
my kind of I guess new twitch channel
twitch.tv slash bit late I'm sorry it's
bit what kind at the cat time ky at the
end KY jelly I'll be streaming remember
the KY jelly that's right that's exactly
where I got the inspiration from has
nothing to do with my name so I'll be
streaming a live build from my Airbnb
the night
for twitchcon just for fun as well as to
raise money for an extra life charity
organization will be the the Children's
Hospital of Los Angeles which is kind of
a local hospital around us yeah near me
and Paul so we're gonna be raising money
and for every 500 dollars donated to
that cause I will be taking a shot on
stream so you know it's for the children
500 bucks it's for the children yeah and
I'll be throwing in you know some some
some some dough myself to get a kick
started to get us closer to that first
shot of pain but it should be funnel
they'll be given progressively more and
more rect as the the build goes on as a
stream goes on so hopefully you guys
tune into that I'll be releasing an
official announcement video probably
sometime tomorrow with all the details
so stay tuned for that but that's all I
want to say let's move on to our tales
of space tales from space as a quick
aside yes pup Shepard thank you for the
dollar donation your question would
distract us too much from what we've
already just been distracted from yes so
we'll come back to that perhaps in the
future so this is really a tale from
space segment because there's only one
story here but it's a big story it's a
big one many of you guys have probably
already heard about Elon Musk giving his
speech today about how he intends on
bringing or popular or colonizing Mars
yep by himself by himself it's just one
dude given birth to millions of people
no it's pretty crazy actually he's got
some insane plans that actually sound
pretty good after you hear his speech
and stuff so there's a video along with
this the video is all CGI but it kind of
gives you an idea of what he intends to
do and how he plans to get people
Earthlings to the red the Big Red Planet
which is which is pretty cool
now to take away some of the by the way
thank you very much Chris for the $10
Commission that's very generous of you
sure they're called for shots I don't
have any shots available but I've got a
beer will do that that felt like about
an ounce or so at least I was definitely
a shot all right so just just taken away
some of the main topics or made the main
notes from Elon Musk's speech today he
said that it's going to take anywhere
from 440 to a hundred years to create a
fully self-sustaining civilization on
Mars I
that doesn't sound like a very long time
that actually sounds pretty decent that
sounds like something that Paul and I
could probably see in our lifetime I
mean 4050 years from now if it's on the
the faster scale we could probably start
to see you know families growing and
going to school and all that kind of
shit on freaking Mars which is a total
mine fuck at this point but it's gonna
happen at some point and according to
you on musk and it's gonna take
approximately that same amount of time
to create a population of 1 million
people on Mars so that's probably what
maybe half or maybe a third of the size
of the city of Los Angeles I say we have
what 2 3 million people here in LA I
don't know I don't follow the census way
okay yeah that sounds reasonable sure
yeah sure let's go with that all right
so you know you get a pretty large city
on Mars within 40 to 100 years that's
pretty exciting they also talked about
he also talked about their
interplanetary transport ship spaceship
yes yes we called the IPS for short it's
it's but it's gonna be made of carbon
fiber because it's superlight and stuff
and very durable with a thrust power mmm
thrust power of 13 thousand tons hmm Wow
sounds familiar propelled by 42 engines
using cryogenic not cryo rig that's
something else
methane as rocket fuel cryogenic methane
will be used as fuel he's envisioning
about a thousand or so of these massive
ships that there's gonna be orbiting in
space at any given time concurrently
they'd be filled by using propellants
tankers I'm not exactly sure what that
is but it sounds like something that
would go out into space into orbit and
refill the ship and then come back to
whatever planet it's coming from which
is kind of what they're doing with the
Falcon 9 rocket s'right they're
launching these Rockets up into space
yeah something to bring them back to
earth and they've already landed like
six or seven of these rocket
successfully back on earth which is
really exciting they're gonna be using
that technology to we're going to be
implementing that into these refueling
tanks which is kind of cool
also the vast number of these ships that
are going to be orbiting in space they
will only have a lifespan of 30 years or
so and 15 flights each so you know
you're gonna they're gonna be trying to
maximize their cargo fill with each of
these each of these ships now they're
gonna be launched from NASA's Kennedy
Space Center but a second launch is
expected to happen on the on the south
coast of Texas from SpaceX themselves
10,000 trips will be needed in case you
guys are wondering how many trips do you
have to take from Earth to Mars in order
to get that one million population
metric well 10,000 10,000 seems to be
the number if we can get at least a
hundred crew members on each of these
ships so that's that's the minimum
they're shooting that's the minimum he
was anticipating in his speech up to 200
right per ship yeah exactly and that
would that would obviously cut it in
half
five thousand trips is a lot less than
ten thousand trip so hopefully that can
happen at some point um he also
expressed some plans to reduce the cost
of the trip to Mars because obviously
flying there isn't cheap he's trying to
reduce the cost by five million percent
by achieving the following there's four
basic principles here that musk was
talking about in order to drive the cost
down for interplanetary travel to Mars
first of which is full reusability again
with the Falcon 9 rocket how they're
testing those refilling in orbit so
those that's where those propeller
propellant tanks come into play a
propellant plant that's on Mars itself
which will actually you know help speed
up the travel time going from you know
the planets to those those ships in
space in orbit and the right propellant
and I didn't actually read too much more
about what they meant by the right
propellant I know you saw the speech I
did not I just read some articles on it
to know what they're talking about the
right propellant like the right
materials for it the right um the right
kind of fuel or you know if that refers
to it all no okay just assume it's some
high-level scientific shit that they are
working hardly all right but I'm hard on
I know refueling is is of particular
importance
and one of the things he mentioned was
creating refueling stations at different
different areas so for example you know
the discussion is primarily about going
to Mars right now but they've developed
the dragon actual Space Shuttle or an
actual little ship that it goes around
in now they developed that to be able to
pretty much go lots of other places as
well yeah because it it propels itself
right it doesn't need for example got
these solar panels that pop out yes
solar arrays so that's for once it's out
in space to get up to like as fast as it
can I mean simply put but yeah he's
basically saying that if you have
fueling stations like for example once
you once we get set up on Mars you can
create another fueling station and
asteroid belts mm-hmm that like you know
harvests the materials there to create
more fuel and then you can jump from
Mars to the asteroid belt refuel there
and then go to Jupiter mmm and then you
know like Titan or there's something
like that you know there's potential
expansion to those kinds of places as
well of course Mars is much more
practical and Mars is much more like
achievable in the near future yes that's
really what the focuses but yeah
apart from this being Minoo how much of
this is like a distraction from like the
the rocket that they had explode
recently but a lot of it this is also
just very exciting there's some really
cool parts in the actual life and the
speech he gave and everything just when
he was talking about the feasibility of
a lot of the stuff that they're doing
and you know I like listening to him
talk because he doesn't often sound like
he's doing a prepared speech or
something like that it seems like a lot
of it's just like he's saying what he
thinks and that kind of thing
yeah and something he said towards the
end of the speech which was that
somebody asks like will you do you want
to be the first person to go to Mars and
somebody else also asks are you gonna go
to space and he says yes he does he
would like to go space and everything he
didn't rule out the possibility of him
being the first person on Mars
I kind of doubt that's his goal
but what he said there was like that the
people who go to Mars are gonna be
risking their lives like no question
about it especially the first people who
go there's gonna be a really high-risk
mission so he said if he was to go on an
early mission to Mars his biggest
concern would be that his that SpaceX
and what he's built back here on earth
would be left in good hands because if
he dies on a mission to Mars exactly
like that he's to valium yeah dig in he
doesn't want he doesn't want the company
taken over by people who will be purely
out to maximize profits and who will
kind of take the their eyes off of this
mission of interplanetary colonization
for Earth and making error for humans
and making humans and multi-planet
species and you know just focus I'm like
oh we got these rockets and you know I
don't know there's short-term goals that
could be focused on for profits versus
the long-term goals and he also said
like he has done a pretty good job of
gathering assets as he put it in himself
but what he wants to do by gathering
assets is invest those into this goal of
you know achieving this next step for
Humanity and I hope to god that he is
telling the truth and that he's being
honest about all this stuff and he's not
really an evil mastermind because that
would suck he seems he seems pretty
legit yeah it seems usually you can tell
when people are on camera as often as
someone like him and we kind of know
this like people are very transparent
when they speak publicly you can kind of
tell what they're thinking or if there's
some kind of some guys going on say he
seems like a pretty genuine guy so I
hope that this whole Mars trip thing
works out it would be freaking amazing
to see in our lifetime
and we will actually start to see
potentially if everything goes according
to plan the first human missions being
deployed in 2025 that's only nine years
away or so eight eight or nine years
away but before this before that takes
place SpaceX is gonna be sending some
unmanned probes to the Red Planet every
two years starting in 2018 just to get
more research more data to make sure
that this mission goes as smoothly as
possible so
it's pretty exciting pretty intense very
ambitious of course and I did want to
finish off this story with a picture a
very humbling picture of SpaceX back in
2012 eight out of two pictures courtesy
of ready to pause to this for this
picture first okay is the new rocket
firing this is the Raptor the Raptor yes
so what they wouldn't what they've been
using up till now has been is the Merlin
engine that's what they have unlike the
current Falcon Heavy and and I think
there's nine of them on there and stuff
the Raptor is essentially the same size
but it's about three times as powerful
and they just recently had a test fire
of it and it didn't explode an Elon Musk
rest his his his pleasure that like he
was like I really thought it was just
gonna explode when we tested it out but
it didn't so that's cool and then he
volunteers to go to Mars on the first
run yeah so yeah here's the picture of
base X in 2002 SpaceX some 14 years ago
this was the whole crew there's probably
no more than a dozen or so
guys there's Elon Musk with a mariachi
band gotta love the maracas humble
beginnings this is very inspiring to see
how far they've come in just you know
less than two decades
they're going to Mars they are just a
mariachi band dicking around now they're
going fucking Larsen indecisive alright
so the bus concludes tale from space
yeah we go ahead and move on to our
second segment which is pit my PC yeah
y'all we got five of you guys who sent
in your rigs actually many of you guys
to send your rigs but we only have time
for five of you but there are some pcs
here that are in dire need of our
critiques and our stern judgments Paul
shall we begin
so we begin with Brinson Brinson I hope
that's how you pronounce your name I
hope it is but Brinson got a no - OH -
bill he says excuse the awful cable
management does he know he's submitting
for pig pen my PC that's what that's
works Peck seeing kind of the opposite
of what we do the fact that we hit you
means you have there's a room for
improvement subject to this hold on so I
need - god damn it what dumb you know
Windows when you do when
new windows left or windows right and
it's like a let me snap this where you
want it to be and you're like I don't
want it to be quite exactly that snap
can be greater I want it to be something
in the in between that's what I'm trying
to do now between snap okay no worries
all right so Britain's Got a no 202 bill
which we don't see too often here on pip
my PC with Mini ITX rigs like this it's
cable management is probably one of the
biggest challenges because there's
literally not enough room where to put
in with them however I've done quite
extensive you know I've had extensive
experience with the No - OH - and I will
say right off the bat looking at your
hardware here and how it's all been laid
into the chassis is that you probably
could utilize some of the empty space if
you go back to that picture of the top
down right below your power supply
there's a bunch of empty space excuse me
beer ah damn bunch of empty space that's
right beneath your power supply but this
is where I store all my like heavy-duty
like the ATX cables just beneath there
because trying to route it where you
have between the power supply and the
other board there isn't much room there
especially if you've got you know dims
and everyone's got dims you know you've
got some dims that are in them in the
way there you don't want the cables
necessarily leaning against your RAM and
providing like torsion against them
that's not good so just you I would say
utilise some of that space beneath your
power supply but also I like the fact
that you've gone with a mini ITX card or
I should say a small form-factor card a
very short PCB card and this is does he
say which one it is
and then leave it's an Asus okay looks
like a nice yes tricks gaming Radeon
what is that a four sixteenths like an
hour X 480 or maybe you're right 460 I
can't tell it's too tiny but like good
call on I'm leaving a little bit of
extra airflow or a little bit of extra
room and not maxing maximising out that
entire area because that would be
probably reduce your temps a little bit
or increase your temps I should say but
apart from that man I think you're good
to go that does he say well okay core i3
then you're fine with that cooler as
long as you're cool with the pun
intended as long as you're okay with the
acoustics of it because I know under
load that might get a little bit noisy
there are a lot of great low-profile
coolers out there that are quiet and
effective obviously you couldn't do any
hardcore overclocking on them not that
you could anyway with an AK or I three
but as long as you're okay with the
acoustic profile of that stock cooler
then I wouldn't say change it and it's
not like there's a side panel window on
this thing you can't look into it once
it's all enclosed up so there's no real
need to have a nicer looking cooler
either
you're okay with ketchup and mustard in
this case litter is that a pun
that was also haha that's the classroom
but what never gets old
oh yeah that's all I would say here is
just record I'd recommend moving those
those cables to beneath your power
supply underneath it there's also some
tie-down points there I believe so that
should help things I agree with child
Paul agrees I have nothing to add and
next we've got Daniel Dan yo the core i7
5820k so x99 16 gigs of ram a GTX 980 in
a Corsair 750d I like this case yeah
that's a good x99 motherboard single
picture
alright this picture first first off
before we get it before we go anywhere
this is not a good picture cuz the flash
ins I mean you got a flash right I can
forgive the flash if you don't have
enough light or whatever you want to put
light in there it's not gonna look good
with the flash though no it's never
gonna look good with the flash it's
gonna look garish which it kind of does
but your cropped in really close like I
can't even see your what's going on up
top radiator or anything like that going
on up top yeah and then clearly here
this is a no-name power supply looks
like an ER max actually no really that's
inner max looks like it to me I'm gonna
confirm in chat if that's an in America
just like it look at logos it looks like
a shitty power supply to me because they
are really really
old enter max power supply but I don't
know if it's any oh wait it's 80-plus
really look at the very bottom left icon
is that is that that was like not even
bronze just 80 plus it's 80 plus hey if
it's 80 plus that's a flush plastic
better all right
so the power supply obviously is a weak
link here you have some pretty good
hardware otherwise a 90 80 and a 5820k
your power supply is not only a shitty
power supply from what I can tell cuz
good power supplies have better better
stickers on the side of them than that
but it's also like where most of the bad
looking cabling comes from so get a new
power supply and then rewire this and
you're good someone said maybe it's a
cool max power supply then it's still
crappy cool cool man well go max it's
not a it's not my go-to brand for power
supplies guys I gotta be it's totally
cool next it is the cool max that's a
cool max logo when you need to be cool
to the max it's like but could you see
how I thought it was under max yeah
Theresa I bet they I bet that was
intentional by them yeah Jesus you
deceptive assholes
so yes pretty much repulsive get a new
power supply rewire stuff and you're
good
agreed let's move on to guerrilla Nader
I think that's how you pronounce it
guerrilla Nader has built his rig around
a 6700 K or a seven and a 980ti with 32
gigs of ram this is a pretty formidable
system that is a substantial list of
parts in a lot more such a system that
seems like it was thrown together in
five minutes thank you
I'm sorry right thank you for that
observation that's what that's what I'm
seeing here yes it looks like you spent
a lot of time choosing the hardware you
spend zero time installing the hardware
were you building in it was this a PC
race it was it like build the computer
as fast as possible plug everything in
yeah when we use major so he see races
at back in Newegg I think it turned out
nicer than this oh this is a level 10 GT
that's a GT right okay yes I'm not the
actual level 10 but the GT possibly
that's a cool case it is I wish they
make more we recent parts ordered from
New Age
it's a nice refrigerator in the
background with some bloody on so that's
which I'm in yeah dude just clean up all
these cables this hell is that noise
what the fuck is that because I care for
no it's not
they go away went away I just turn the
speaker off it went away turn it on
again no no I still hear it alright it's
my neighbor it's my neighbor and that's
a saw that's my neighbor
that's a saw yes it's my neighbor with
the saw in the garage
I was a fury I knew I was wow it sound
like ducks screaming ah very strange
sound weird yeah grill inator you have a
beastly system here do it
the justice service yeah I've cleaning
up that cable array that you have
because you got a nice case - I like it
yeah alright thank you very much Nick
for the donation with a 6600 plus a 10-7
to get thermally wrecked in the No - OH
- the 1070 should be okay cuz it has its
own dedicated air airflow like your
graphics card should be fine yeah
a big question of keeping that 6600 cool
I think if you could if you could get a
mini gtx 1070 in water cool your 6600
yeah i did a video on that you check it
out good luck next up we've got Scott
Scotty beam me up Scotty another picture
okay so he's got his piece Lee here this
looks like another 750d no wait this is
the same one no it's different it's need
to be a 760 or a No what's 787 eighty I
was talking out the case yeah the case
okay
oh it's a 780 oh great seven eight yeah
that's what I'm thinking so maybe T
because the 780 has the same interior
layout as the 760 yeah but it's got that
different structure on the outside the
fans are a giveaway - or no those those
are aftermarket fans I don't think
there's with the stock case man they of
course their fans yeah they are anyway
anyway uh very very ROG here super oh my
god
I don't you if I'm Reggie everything
holy crap is it just the the bow of the
picture of the lens or are those cards
sagging a lot the curtains look like
they're sagging in this picture
and yeah I don't think it's the lens I
think your cards have a fair amount of
sag going on the head over to like mm PC
tech there's something because they have
some really nice brackets for correcting
GPU sag a little support there apart
from that to help you out pretty clean
all-around cable management could be
improved at least with the CPU cooler
little bit here and there yeah yeah I
think the IO is probably the worst part
here you got a few shortcuts kind of
loose random cables going out here any
like this cable that's coming across
here which I believe is going to the fan
like you know you need to pull that up
to go up and over up and over and get it
get it around the side and make sure
it's it's less visible yeah other than
that I mean as far as color coordination
and product coordination you have an
asus and corsair build which looks very
nice yeah they they pair well together
you do and it's also looks insanely
powerful so good good going yeah
nice build I like it next up we've got
many grams what's up my man this is an
ear 240 no Brian thank you for your $5
donation sir and we are doing our damn
best to entertain you and all the people
here which isn't saying you're in
Detroit
I've never been a safe I've never been
to Detroit neither run yeah sounds like
a great city Detroit has a lot of hurt
they do if you die from what I hear yes
all right so I really like the backplate
you're a fallout 4 backplate that's
pretty slick I also do like the orange
theme these are straight-up Linus tech
tips fans the Linus tech tips fan Enoch
- uh - tech tips version yes
which which I'm always torn about cuz
I'm like well it's Linus but they
probably performed roulette there Noctua
and they're all black feel so conflicted
yeah
so what do you do in a case like that it
wasn't it wasn't enough for me to use
them
in and my wife spilled because that was
an orange theme build stuck with the ek
barters yeah
in that circumstance rhythm here it
looks pretty nice oh by the way I didn't
realize that was Brian from bps mom
that's why I said Brian oh I thought you
just read the name I didn't really
there's so many Brian now in the world
see how much I feel I knew his name and
I know who he is
thank you Brian that's why I said Brian
is because I was trying to drive that
point home I'll secretly hate without
being all overt about it like hey I know
people's names told me that's completely
false that's also very misleading it
makes people think I'm a much like I'm
not a nice perk I'm a very nice person
all right you haven't seen Paul off
camera I like motor diva like it is
Satan it is it is a challenge to be a
person that I don't like however I do
have a very short list of people that I
really hate and I will kill them all and
fuck those people maybe both did some
terrible terrible shit to get on my my
list of hated people yeah more more on
that in a future episode I'm sure I'm
gonna dip in my time baby it's great
Grandmaster chubbs thank you for your
baby oil money we'll add it to the pile
about they forgot for our favorite
rappers Tupac Tupac's good I really do
like him in him and he's very talented
Snoop Dogg's super chill Dre I actually
say Dre Dre not Drake I just I like to
park because two pockets Tupac and he
doesn't give a fuck and he is Tupac
because he's dead and that well that
says you that's what you that's what you
think
Osama coupe shows that wasn't a hologram
alright so getting back on track here
with this build oh yeah this shit
honestly pretty decent job all around I
think the table yeah we type of the
build
I'm cool with the I like the orange
theme I think the sound card is it down
there
that kind of ruins things for me cuz
it's got a red PCB is what is that yeah
that might actually be an a network
maybe it's a network card at any rate it
kind of throws me off in terms of the
aesthetics of the build yeah and also a
place I'd also say maybe add another
exhaust fan at the back of the case yeah
sure while in there and hit him up
hit him up is one of the best songs some
cables some sleep extensions would be
really nice and in this type of case you
have plenty of room on the opposite side
of the motherboard tray to just stash
excess cables so a really easy job for
you to maybe pick up some orange and
black sleeve cables are just plain black
I think would look nice any rate
everything else matches pretty nicely
and I don't think there's much else to
say here yep what is what is that
beneath the radiator fans I don't know
that might be a hub but looks like a
hugger should be a fan hub I mean I
don't know what motherboard this is no
it's an Asus it's a tough motherboard
this is a saber-toothed I don't know is
it it looks like a fan hub or something
like that but yeah I'm really not sure
yeah if anyone knows in chat say
something so it was curious so Matt can
can be helped and stuff but that's
pretty much gonna conclude in my PC for
today thank you guys very much for
submitting your rigs yeah I do
appreciate it we'll be doing this again
in a week or two if you didn't happen to
get picked for this week so on that note
we're gonna go ahead and slide on over
to our next segment which is yet another
fun kind of shenanigans type of thing
which is face-off oh oh I forgot about
the pennant 4 yeah I know her face up
this one penalty was your idea by the
way that was my idea it was a very good
idea hmm
although that you're gonna have to but
you're gonna regret in a moment
that was before I have been having a
decent oh look how prepared I am by the
way look at the variance all you people
no no no no punishment is right here
it's about to be I better get up and go
to the refrigerator and get the
punishment all right so it's Weider's
raspberry cider yeah so a few weeks back
we went on the day of refinements and I
sent a message out to the people who
were going and was like hey everyone I'm
going to BevMo does anyone want any
beverages and I got a message from Jays
wife mrs. Jays two cents if you want to
message her on Twitter and she was like
get me some raspberry cider so specific
and I was like ok and you were like I
know just the one and I found her as
berry cider this is why ters hard cider
dry raspberry and she had one of them I
got a six-pack now we have to drink the
rest
I got a six-pack and I don't know it's
easy enough to drink one of these but I
don't want more than one so I guess I
can understand why
she only had one so don't trust a drink
called whiter ciders so Cal and I are
gonna play this game called soccer
physics against each other as per some
of your recommendations in chat the
punishment will be whoever loses
that's the child one of you must
immediately pound one of these
immediately it's like a sheet and then
also drink the other one at their
leisure yeah I hope I gotta do - yeah oh
shit I just got damn it what are you
dogs close the window
well no no just control control t t Oh
see that's the keyboard shirt kind of
know what control shift T yeah opens up
the clothes tab okay and where they talk
pull some hey good one
amazing all right soccer physics so I've
never played this I promise and you
don't know how to play it so there's a
tor hill or something it's probably just
like two buttons that we need to press
music two budgets two buttons is the
thing you could turn on or off I don't
know what that means two buttons oh yeah
let's go back I'm Liz are we gonna play
a test game or we're just gonna go let's
do a test since we have no idea how to
play it we'll just make sure that we
know oh oh it's W and up blue team is up
arrow red team I'm ready
I'm Red Team I got okay
just some house control you're fucking
awesome alright alright save up arrow
all right here we go
all right looks like I'm red I think we
played this before it looks similar to
game a game we've played in the past oh
my god I went behind the eye why does
one for me my guys just retreated and
it's a beach ball now the balls change
nope
yes get it out of here No oh my god
looks lovely out of bounds it's out of
bounds
oh fuck you poor you okay should we
reach the boo-boo-boo should we restart
since it's even or good vines alright
since we got kind of a vague idea of
what the hell is going on now that I
know how to press W and what are we
playing - best of five best of five it's
the first efficient first-person with
three goals yep let's do it that's
reasonable here we go first oh look
that's not they saying first of five but
we're gonna play first yeah yeah look at
a headshot what though look at that hit
oh now we got a football oh my god my
guys are in the goal get out of the
fucking goal I gotta keep you in there
there's some serious sixty-nining going
on right now
oh shit yeah no it's slippery this is
not good snowing what that's bullshit
that's bullshit oh my god this game is
amazing oh no I hate this - okay alright
we're just oh my goodness
oh look at that save so the next next
points win next point wins
yeah right alright yeah yeah oh my god
why the goals are small now oh my god
I've just ended up I'm scared
Oh
see I knew exactly what to do I was like
I'm just not gonna push any buttons just
just test a patient say I push the
button and all this game is lost can I
drink this out of a glass I just spilled
water have a coupon
say I'm never hitting insert or print
screen on that keyboard oh boy that I
need to drink this out of something okay
drink it out of my butt try to jack the
keyboard okay I'm not gonna like kill
the stream by doing this in that oh good
lord
good lord weird a bomb gross cleaning
you're regurgitating beer water
oh it's water yes literally water that
came direct it slamming water that was
in my mouth first
it just was directly out of the that's
better than I suppose sorry about the
dog in the barking and everything at
people what's the final category
I don't category is new to segment that
we talk about any news good you've gone
into the tech news you know my grand
time to look at look how on points TV
show is you know Chris thank you again
for your $10 donation blue on behalf of
the dog iPod look you look at look at
this look what I'm drinking rain god
okay let's refreshing actually a little
bit dude you're good sport
to physics hmm all right let's talk
about our first news article our first
tech article here which is about
Microsoft if you guys have heard about
this but Microsoft is selling an n64
emulator for the PC and Xbox one on its
Microsoft Store ok toast or I'm excited
I personally love n64 is one of I guess
one of the first consoles I ever got as
a as a youngin and apparently you can
get in it you can buy an emulator for it
on the PC for $9.99 this is kind of
weird however because that's seven point
six nine pounds at seven point six nine
pounds if you're here
apparently this should not be happening
like Microsoft has a really strict
policy of what gets sold on their
Windows Store and what doesn't and this
should definitely not be on the store
because Microsoft and Nintendo are
direct competitors in the console market
so feel like Nintendo would be kind of
pissed about this yeah I'm sure I think
I think that there was just a huge
slip-up with Microsoft true or the side
room my guests never ends with a huge
slip-up with Nintendo's QA process where
they just allow this one to slip through
the cracks but if you guys were
interested in buying it read the reviews
first because they're they're pretty
negative actually it's only only has
like two out of five stars and a rating
it's a crappy emulator well most of the
complaints are from xbox one users who
are saying that the mod does not work at
all on Xbox or it does but the games
that the roms run it like half-speed and
there's like choppy audio and things
like that there's been like one or two
reviews from PC users who say mod works
great no problems no issues but that's
that's a real small sample size too
to base your decision off of so just do
a little bit more research if you are
gonna buy something like this because I
have a feeling that either Microsoft or
Nintendo if not both of them are
eventually going to to canvas and you're
not gonna be able to buy this on the
Windows Store in like a week or two
I'm surprised that the story is even
still there yeah the store should be
gone by now the whole uwp shoes have
been obliterated at this point what's up
shiny a cow should everyone go and
upshot is they've never Tendo sixty-four
emulators your diehard well the upshot
depends Paul because if you buy this
emulator and Microsoft Kansas and and
prohibits anyone from buying this
anymore do you still get to keep it
probably not right like you spend ten
bucks on this emulator and then
Microsoft Nintendo banned it from the
store is that also like corrupt your
installation of the game over the
emulator country coalition so that would
depend not so that kind of you know
would determine whether or not it's
worth investing in this because chances
are at least from my perspective and I
think they are the author of the article
agrees that this is probably not going
to be around in the Windows Store for
very long once Nintendo and or Microsoft
catch wind of this but you can buy it
my Mike yet it my guess would be that if
they ban it from the store they would
issue automatic refunds to anyone who
bought it and then you wouldn't have
access to it anymore but truly your
question Pierce's to the heart of
digital ownership of intellectual
property in the modern age and Internet
I was trying to sound intelligent sound
a second but I've been pounding
raspberry cider so forgive me so you
cannot be trusted
it's what is what you're saying but
there's food for thought I suppose in
case you guys are some diehard emulator
fans wow you just pounded it got the
whole thing yeah well you've only got
one more to go Paul but you can drink
this one at your own pace
so no that was both other was both you
just patted both these want to give it
over with
yeah I'm sick of that shit and ice at
least you don't steal anymore but now
than you suspect
okay it's gonna be the first black you
know she owns not gonna affect me at all
my half of the show is gonna be like
flawless flawless on points no slurring
of the words no slurring of speech I'm
just gonna be pow I'm gonna be pal it's
already begun debit yeah
hurry up teary eration alright okay
let's talk about AMD and their plans for
2019 this seems like a ways away but it
is upon us with their upcoming line of
AP use now next year we're gonna see
their what does it call Raven Ridge is
that Z no Raven Ridge ap use or expected
to launch next year okay talk about EP
use here this is a different story but
when did they switch the birds would we
have Ravens and gray and gray box I know
the islands was GPUs what was it before
excavator bulldozer
they were like tractors him they named
their they used to name the chips after
well Louis Kaveri what's Kaveri is that
dude it's but no fuck if I know
I always thought it was like an exotic
dancer I should alert APU burlesque I
should try some the 8 core burlesque is
some pumpkin spiced cider would be
delicious anyway there's a Raven Ridge
apu expected to launch next year on the
14 nanometer architecture very much like
intel is at right now 40 nanometers it's
gonna be the Vega GPU the integrated
graphics is gonna be based on the Vega
architecture
however this article is more to the more
so talking about long term in the future
2019 two years from now sorry three
years from now almost two years where
we're gonna have to we're actually gonna
see a 7 nanometre apu the first of its
kind from teen red 4 cores 8 threads
pretty impressive
at 10 watt TDP four cores and eight
threads at 10 watts TDP with an IPC
performance game by 40% the article
didn't say 40% over what yeah 40% it's
kind of important I don't know what that
means but that's what it says and that's
the 40% better than a processor that is
40% slower than it they might as well
have said that and that's gonna be based
on the newer Nabi not Nabi or not Navi
Navi is like her
Navi they're not are yeah that's from
Avatar so is Maddie like but Navi is
like your navigation system so it we
used to call navigational systems back
when we had GPS devices yeah in the car
that weren't our phones back when
everyone had like a Garmin in their - as
your Navi now you're right that's that's
true and now and now that they're gone I
guess we'll call them knobby and we'll
just give James Cameron a shout-out Navi
sounds more sophisticated it does just
put that up yeah even though they
represent a savage savage community of
their missile aliens they're just
they're simply misunderstood whatever
man okay all right that's all I wanted
to say about that good consider
yourselves informed what everyone knows
everything about that now yes that's our
goal yeah for everyone to know
everything about everything all the time
and we're succeeding
don't bother backtracking you gotta shut
up I can't I can't have giggle fits this
early in the show Isis items are really
kicking in yeah that no they're not
they're not affecting me at all
this is this other beer Paul's drunk I'm
girly drinks Paul's drunk I'm girly
drinks FCC has Wi-Fi at the debate did
not make that makes none is completely
wrong not Gerson's completely wrong the
FCC
does not have Wi-Fi at the presidential
debate hall hey provides Ted with the
articles about his is journalists
attending B of the debate having to fork
out $200 for the private Wi-Fi signal
that was there that's a lot of money
it's a lot of freaking money Wi-Fi
apparently all journalists who were at
the presidential presidential debate
which happened yesterday sure many do
you guys caught it we're told to shut
down their personal Wi-Fi hotspots and
or or get the fuck out basically it was
like shut off your personal Wi-Fi
hotspots or get the hell out you cannot
attend the debate or you can pay $200
for the Wi-Fi here holy shit that's
pretty absurd even for a big national
event like this maybe so so just just
spitballing here but do you think this
was a ploy to prevent people from using
live streaming services to that might
preempts the live stream or the actual
broadcast of the event itself maybe it's
possible just I've just just spitballin
it could be but still nothing preventing
someone from paying the $200 and live
streaming it anyway I don't know I don't
know why they did but I thought I
thought I heard that even if you paid
the 200 bucks for the the Wi-Fi I heard
it was down like it didn't even work oh
I didn't I didn't see that in the order
didn't catch that no okay but if that's
the case that that sounds that sounds
even more awful somehow like people just
journalists thrown away 200 bucks and
can't even hop onto Facebook tweet about
Hillary or Trump that would suck and how
amazing they both did there's no
evidence that the block was coming from
Hofstra University which is where the
debate was held but one journalist did
tweet out a photo showing a handheld
device that was being used to scan for
any any rogue wireless networks
yeah yeah yeah so there were technicians
at the University that's a debate this
is we're rolling around shutting down
this is why my Hanzo wired.com article
by the way yes thank you uh thank you
wired so yeah there were technicians
rolling around shutting down hot spots
oh you're using lively your own personal
Wi-Fi hotspot' that you bought and paid
for shut down give me 200 oh shut down
give me ow
it's fucking crazy it's amazing so FCC
member Jessica rosenworcel can't believe
I pronounced that right on the first try
she was asking the agency the FCC of
course to investigate the debates ban on
journalists Wi-Fi personal hotspots
because she thinks it's unethical and
she even cited as an example in August
2015 order from the FCC directly forcing
a company called Smart City to cease
Wi-Fi blocking and pay a fine of 750
thousand dollars so apparently Rosen
services its the question here is this
like legal is it legal to block what is
it legal to block it can you can you
just pick no you can't have Wi-Fi here
yeah if it's your own wife either you
bought and paid for I mean it seems
weird right I mean even if it's a
private property doesn't someone have
the right to access the internet from
their own device I don't know I don't
know if there's like legislation on that
or anything I have nothing I have zero
intelligent like furthering of that but
maybe but so just speculation here I
have no information on it either but
maybe your speculation here there are
places where they don't allow cell phone
use yeah so that's a form of data
transmission okay I mean obviously a
much much less sophisticated one but if
there are places that can legally ban
cell phone use or you know things like
that then maybe but it depends on why
because like on an airplane you're
illegally I think it's legal we
obligated to like shut your phone off
when they take off and stuff your
according to the
federal law you must obey the
instructions of the flight crew right so
if the flight crew tells you to turn off
your electronic devices right then yes
you're obligated by law to do that but
if it's under a different circumstance
where it's just like well we don't want
you guys live streaming the event and it
has nothing to do with personal safety
then does that now become illegal for
you to request people to to disable
their weapon and like I said this this
is actually kind of an interesting topic
for like if it was something that we had
done extensive research beforehand to
find out more facts about cause like
consider something like going to a hotel
you know yeah like that where they often
charge for Wi-Fi right like if you had
some other alternative but the hotel was
actively blocking that would that be
against the law right I don't know yeah
so we are just not informed enough to
really have a debate this either way but
that's this has been an unforeseen issue
that's come up surrounding the already
pretty controversial debate so there you
guys have it yes indeed you now know
everything mats tech reviews thank you
for your comment and chest woo very kind
of glad you're able to watch us live in
their next step that EVGA crying about
some more hardware here launching their
GTX 1080 and 1070 my mouse for the win
hybrid karts yay and these are
closed-loop iOS that the the the
manufacturer is being slapping on to
these GT 104 chips and they are for the
win they feature for the win grade
componentry so a little bit higher
standards maybe a bit more longevity
better power delivery than the non for
the win cards so that's cool
RGB lighting is introduced of course as
is with everything these days why not
semi high-end why not why the fuck not
it is configurable with the EVGA
software in the OS it does feature the
actual cooler the GPU block features a
copper copper base and there's also a
dedicated memory play
with that has direct contact on the
memory chips themselves the reason why
it's hybrid is because on everything
obviously is water-cooled you can see
there's a fan on the GPU block itself
and that's basically cooling all the
VRMs the power delivery none of that is
water-cooled so that's why it's kind of
a hybrid configuration here but overall
we're supposed to expect temperatures
cut in half from what you would see on
an ordinary reference design which is
promising if the if the cards can can
live up to that they've also been
overclocked factory overclocked here so
on the GTX 1080 we're seeing a base
clock of seventeen hundred and twenty
one megahertz and a boost clock of
eighteen hundred and sixty on the
founders Edition the boost clock is 1733
so we're seeing over a hundred almost a
hundred and twenty I guess yeah hundred
and thirty megahertz overclock over the
founders issue which is pretty nice on
the gtx 1070 we're seeing a boat a
little bit less than one hundred
megahertz of a boost i'm sorry a little
bit more about a hundred and ten hundred
and fifteen megahertz going from sixteen
hundred and eighty-three to seventeen
hundred and ninety seven on the boost
everything else remains the same memory
clock speed is still 8,000 megahertz for
a gtx 970 and ten thousand megahertz for
the 1080 no pricing and the build
availability yet but i would assume that
the gtx 1070 hybrid is probably around
550 to 600 dollars and the GTX ten
eighty would probably be closer to 700
or eight
hey the pricing is already there
apparently I could have just googled it
but instead I didn't approximate it in
my mind I don't see the 1070 b8h has it
all right
oh wow no that's not over the wins vnh
is just lying to us there's the 1080
like I said it's 7800 so this is that
738 bucks B and H does have the 1080 for
the win
hybrid 740 us that's I mean I don't know
wow it's like wow that's like paying the
already pretty high price for the 1080
plus what you might expect for water
cooling on top of it yeah just want to
cool yourself it's not like wow what a
great deal it's the same price as the
founders Edition or whatever it now yeah
but moving on to our last story here
wrapping things up because we are out of
time
about Gears of War for coming to the PC
of course we all know that it's gonna be
arriving on our favorite platform it's
going to be it's been announced that the
game for PC will have an insane settings
infection on the PC which according to
the developers that the Coalition is
gonna be too demanding for a GTX 1080
paired with a core i7 and 32 gigs of ram
so if you have a fucking 2000 dollar
system it probably won't be able to run
this game at insane settings now it
didn't specify what resolution I'm
guessing 1080 if they don't specify I
just amount automatically assume it's
1080 because it's still kind of
mainstream but that's pretty intense I
mean not being able to run a 1080 game a
game at 1080 with the GT X 1080 there's
too many 1080 s going on right now it's
pretty insane the reason why they're
doing this insane path pun the technical
director Mike Raynal Rainer says the
game will this will allow the game to
scale with future hardware
you know the 1100 series or whatever the
hell it's called they want the game to
be able to scale the future hardware -
so the gamers can enjoy higher visual
fidelity things like that I don't know I
don't know how I feel about that I mean
I feel like if you have like two Titan
XPS then you could probably run the game
in 1080 right I would think I don't know
like I'm on here I farted yeah here did
for it good lord I'm always torn about
this sort of thing
see you're not used to it Jesus like
spun it on the one hand you can come up
with a game with you know a unique
engine or whatever and you can set it up
and you back all right you need the
highest end graphics card in order to
play this game at the highest settings
or you can do something like Crysis is
done in the past and the CryEngine has
done in the past of previous versions
and say you can't run this game at the
highest settings with everything turned
on and turned up I actually kind of like
the second option so if that is the case
if that's what they're going for with
Gears of War 4 I would say I approve
because for one to be a great benchmark
for two it would give people more of a
reason to like you know uh well you know
you know if you really want to play it
at 4k with everything turned up like you
got to get this extra hardware and stuff
like that like I think there's always
like if there's a good reason for people
to invest more in higher end PC gaming
hardware I think that's a good thing
because it keeps pushing the industry
forward and like whereas there's been a
lot of sort of separation between like
oh the desktop market is shrunk a lot
but the gaming PC market has grown so
yeah anything that pushes that forward
and important yeah I mean the only thing
that I'm concerned about is like like
Crysis 3 we're finally getting Jeep
single GPUs I can handle it Mac settings
you know anything beyond 1080 but no
one's playing the game anymore because
it's it's been out for several years now
so my fear is that the insanity or the
insane setting for this game would be
stood on consumers as an enthusiast I
can appreciate it just like you were
saying just to be able to push the
limits of the hardware and stuff but
from a consumer standpoint it might be
kind of a bummer that by the time you're
actually able to run the game Gears of
War 4 might beat or Gears of War 5 might
be on the horizon but from from a
reviewer standpoint it excites me
physically like your erect like I am
