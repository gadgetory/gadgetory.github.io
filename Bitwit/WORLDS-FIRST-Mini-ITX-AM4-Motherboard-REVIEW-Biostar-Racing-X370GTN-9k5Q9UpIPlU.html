channel hope you're all doing well I am
SuperDuper excited because I finally get
to show you guys the world's first mini
ITX am for motherboard for AMD risin
this is the Biostar x 370gt it's finally
here over a month after the initial
release of horizon and I know world's
first sounds a little click baby and it
might be but I think this is valid this
is the first publicly available for
purchase a m4 mini ITX board at least to
my knowledge honestly I think Rison is a
really good fit for mini ITX for a
couple reasons the first of which is
that we can now build small form-factor
systems with relatively affordable CPUs
that are rockin more than four cores and
eight threads right so before this
motherboard the best we could do on this
form factor was the 7700 K from Intel
with 4 cores 8 threads and I guess you
could count the x99 asrock motherboard
that was mini ITX however it was just
awkward as hell it had some weird
compatibility quirks when it came to the
CPU cooler not to mention it was
incredibly expensive I think it's still
retailing for around 250 bucks which is
just outrageous not to mention the price
that you're going to have to pay for an
LGA 2011 processor with you know eight
cores 16 threads when you can get one on
the rise inside of things
for much cheaper the other nice thing
about Mini ITX a m4 is that Rison
currently offers a number of 65 watt TDP
parts that are very power efficient and
don't require a ton of cooling so when
you're dealing with a small form-factor
case and you're often limited by how big
your CPU cooler is or can be it's nice
to just be able to throw on one of the
stock coolers that comes included with
those 65 watt CPUs and just be good to
go you can even dial in some nice
overclocks with like the wraith spire or
the wraith max and that's obviously
going to save me some money too on a
third-party aftermarket CPU cooler so
that's awesome but let's get down to
some of the specs and features of the
motherboard itself that's why we're here
first of which I'm going to address the
elephant in the room which is the X 370
chipset we've all sort of been
scratching our heads
since catching wind of this board
because there are several features of X
370 that simply can't be utilized on
this form factor for instance you get 2
additional PCIe gen 2 general purpose
lanes over B 350 but where are those
going to go I mean apart from the 4
lanes that's eaten up
the m2 slot on the back of the
motherboard which is nice it does
supports data and PCIe of course and
then that's pretty much it so those the
rest of the PC aliens that you get with
that with this chipset are sort of
wasted there additionally with just one
PCIe gen3 by 16 slot you can't really
take advantage of x3 70s other notable
feature which is SLI support so I don't
exactly know why we need it on a mini
ITX board but there you have it and I
mean it's not like it's hurting the
product unless manufacturers are
charging a premium over be 350
equivalents that effectively do the same
thing and Biostar is slated to start
selling a be 350 version of this board
for like 10 to 20 bucks less so I would
consider opting for that board assuming
it overclocks and supports memory as
good as this one that being said for the
mere 110 bucks that I paid for this
board I wouldn't knock anyone for buying
it because it's already pretty
affordable taking a look at the rest of
the board though we've got our beautiful
a m4 socket flanked by the vrm which I
really know nothing about at this point
I do know that it does have a heatsink
on it that is RGB the LEDs can be
disabled most importantly you can
configure the the color in the operating
system or in the BIOS now one
interesting thing about this motherboard
is that it comes fitted with a four pin
CPU power connector as opposed to the
traditional 810 that we typically see on
gaming centric mini ATX motherboards so
the question there is does that impact
or affect our ability to overclock Rison
in any way and the short answer is watch
the rest of the video because I will be
answering just that you get to DIMM
slots on the board supporting up to 32
gigs of DDR 4 at 3200 megahertz
if you overclock and with the memory kit
that I have here which is a G scale
flare X ddr4 kit that's a 16 gigabyte
kit at 3200 I was able to hit that rated
frequency no problem of course you have
to go into the BIOS and dial in your
timings and your voltage yourself do all
that manually just like you have to do
with all the existing am4 boards for the
most part but we're running at 3200
which is a big deal because of the
significant impact that fast memory has
on rising gaming performance and its
really nice to see that the first and
currently the only Mini ITX same for
motherboard is able to do this and run
it at that frequency just above the DIMM
slots you get your only two system fan
headers which are four pin PWM although
I do wish there was a third one that's
okay though based on the price point
it's a fairly entry-level board I know
and if you're rocking an AO they
generally have some fan headers coming
off of them some fan cables to connect
your radiator fans or the worst case
mirror you could always use a fan
splitter or something like that next to
the fan headers you get a pair of 5050
RGB headers which is pretty cool if you
want to bling out your system and then
if we work our way over to the bottom
right corner of the board we get four
SATA six ports which are all natively
controlled by the X 370 chipset and
those are kind of sandwich a single 20
pin USB 3.0 header you also get one USB
2.0 header on the board as well on the
rear i/o you'll find a single ps2 port 5
USB 3.0 ports which is quite generous a
single dual link DVI and HDMI out which
you cannot use with Rison because Rison
does not have nigp you so these are
really meant for the upcoming AP use on
a m4 that should be here relatively soon
I don't know exactly when we're dropping
but we should see some pretty cool HT PC
builds using those so that's exciting
there's also an Ethernet LAN port and
your usual fanfare of 3.5 millimeter
audio jacks and optical s/pdif out now
before we discuss the kind of overclock
I was able to hit with this board let's
quickly go over the testing hardware
starting with the CPU I chose the Rison
v 1600 X which has six cores and twelve
threads it's also a 95 watt TDP part I
wanted it to be 95 watt and not 65 watt
just to test the power limitations of
that 4 pin CPU power connector the CPU
itself is being cooled by a corsair h
110 i GT which is a 280 millimeter
radiator a IO and it is totally overkill
for the 1600 X in my opinion however I
did not want to be limited by I don't
want to be thermally limited in this
test for overclocking and stuff so
that's going to do a nice job of that
we've also got the 16 gig G scale flare
X ddr4 32 hundred megahertz kit that we
already discussed for our video card we
have the gtx 1070 mini from gigabyte
seemed appropriate for this board which
were running at the factory default
speeds out of the box our boot drive is
the adata SX 900 SSD it's a 512 gig
capacity drive and finally our power
supply is the HX 750 watt from Corsair
on that note let's talk about
overclocking specifically were we
limited in any way by that four pin CPU
power connector
well I'm happy to report that our 1600 X
was able to hit 4.1
Hertz at one point four to five volts
rock solid stable running a 264 for over
an hour now and it's looking good guys
it's looking real good it doesn't seem
like we're running into any issues with
that four pin CPU connector when it
comes to rise in overclocking so just to
reiterate we got four point one
gigahertz on the 1600 X our ddr4 kit is
running at 3200 mega Hertz these are the
same frequencies that I've been able to
hit on high-end X 370 motherboards that
are full ATX form factor so all together
I mean that's that's almost I think
that's good enough for me that does it
for me I don't feel like there's really
any compromise here apart from not being
able to sli or you know limited em two
slots so you still get one but still
overall this is a fantastic board and I
would recommend it if you're in the
market for a small form-factor a m4
system also because it's your only
option at this point
so hopefully more boards like this are
to come in the near future and I'm going
to be building a system with this
specific board so be sure to stay
subscribed or get subscribe to the
