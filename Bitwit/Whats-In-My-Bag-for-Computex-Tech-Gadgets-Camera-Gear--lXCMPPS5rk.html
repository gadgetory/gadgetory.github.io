channel today it's very exciting because
I actually leave for Computex in about
10 hours there's no there's no watch on
here is this is kind of weird but yes
it's super exciting there's a lot of
stuff that I need to bring in particular
all of my tech gear so all the things
that I'm gonna be using to create
produce and edit all the footage that
you guys are going to be seeing in your
inboxes later later on this week and so
forth so there's a lot of stuff here I
have it all strewn about on the table
whoo we're just gonna go down the line
and talk about everything that I'm
bringing maybe at the end of the video
you guys can let me know if there's
anything I missed or if there's
something that you might suggest that I
bring on my way to LAX so okay let's
let's go ahead and talk about it let's
do it if you're gonna go halfway across
the world and you're gonna be editing
footage you're gonna need a gaming
laptop or some kind of powerful laptop
or computer but computers are big and
I'm not bringing one you can see the go
anywhere do anything PC is over there
just chilling in the corner I was gonna
bring him to copy text but I decided not
to big too much shit
and also if I brought that I would only
have one connected monitor whereas with
a laptop I can actually connect the G
Sheik to 5:01 a right here and have a
dual monitor setup which is really nice
for editing so again this is the msi gs6
t ghost pro superfast got a core i7
skylake cpu in their mobile ship of
course and a gtx 970m just a beast of a
system battery life is total shit but
hopefully I'll be able to jack in
somewhere I've also got the the this HS
one a super old pair of Corsair
headphone it's actually a gaming headset
my first gaming headset ever I'm just
bringing it along for the ride because
it's super comfortable and I don't care
what happens to it if it gets lost or
stolen it's a piece of crap now anyway
no it's actually still fairly decent I'm
sorry that's it I didn't mean it course
you need a good Mouse you need a good
Mouse if you have a good laptop
otherwise what's the point you dick
this is the GS I'm sorry big of G is 602
G 6:02 from Logitech wireless mouse
double A batteries super good battery
life even though they're not
rechargeable shit ton of macro
programmable buttons on there dpi
adjustment super comfortable it's
awesome it's a good Mouse Crysis 3
mousepad hell yeah I love just t-bag in
profits face but Mouse alright what's
happening external SSD 512 gig don't be
fooled by the HyperX branding it's
actually in a Teta SP 900 in here 512
gigs you got all my assets in shit it's
awesome also got this little little guy
Kingston DataTraveler USB 3.0 flash
drive
I don't know what I keep on here cuz
it's only 32 gigs but it's nice to have
a USB Drive I guess got some battery
packs here battery packs are always
essential for a trip like this
especially if you're gonna be using your
mobile devices a lot like I am you know
tweeting and posting the social media
and stuff while I'm at Computex it's
nice to have backup power so we've got
this MSI one history it's just a rebrand
it's om actually but ten thousand four
hundred milliamps definitely gives you
some solid some solid charge time charge
capacity however it is only a one amp
port I believe it charges pretty slowly
that's why I'm also bringing along this
role as well one that's 13,000 milliamps
I've never fully drained this on a
single trip it's just a beast of a
freakin power brick it's got a
flashlight in there it's not funny
I've never needed the flashlight but
maybe I will this trip who knows it's
actually got two amp port as well as a
one amp port so me and wifey sauce could
both use this at the same time if we
wanted to just a tag team it and then
we've got the G chic monitor coming back
to this this is the two-five-zero one a
this thing is just absolutely beautiful
to have when you're on going to an event
like Computex where you want to edit so
gonna be able to do that dual monitor
setup again this is IPS has really good
color production not great for gaming
because you know it's it's just it's
it's IPs of the response time is really
slow and get some trailing and stuff but
for color correction and all things
productivity it's a fantastic piece of
hardware it's 15.6 inches I believe that
comes with all the appropriate cables
actually comes with HDMI a lot of these
external portable monitors don't have
HDMI connections they use like USB for
therefore their power and further their
video transfer or VGA this is 1920 by
1080 and it does have a native HDMI
connection so excellent stuff we've also
got this this is my Nexus 7 tablet more
for leisure than it is for productivity
it's also got a nice case on there but
this thing is awesome I love this thing
when I'm traveling especially when I'm
on the plane it's great for watching
movies or playing mobile games and
things like that again very simple
leisure stuff usually I watch movies on
it especially I've got this little
little connector here is a headphone
splitter that I'll I'll share with wifey
sauce if we ever want to watch a movie
at the same time with the laptop or with
the tablet we can do that we've also got
a Soundlink mini this is from Bose and
Bose is you know they're pretty
overpriced at times but I
got this one for free I think I got this
at the Verizon store when I picked up my
samsung galaxy s6 a while back they were
just handed these things out like
hotcakes so I was like yeah sure I'll
take one it's just a mini bluetooth
speaker it actually sounds really good
despite you know how overpriced it may
be it fills a room quite decently so if
you know we want a pregame at the air
B&amp;amp;B or something before we go to some
industry party we can bump some tunes in
the meantime and this is the the meat
and potatoes guy this is the meat and
potatoes here I've got the gh4 lumix
from panasonic this is an excellent body
because it's actually quite small for a
DSLR body so it keeps it nice and
portable however my lens is certainly
not as the Sigma 13 I'm sorry 18 to 35
millimeter lens but it's just a
beautiful lens it's very versatile and
speaking of which the meta bones speed
booster adapter that I have in here is
an active adapter that not only converts
an EF lens or sub mix of Nghia fliends
supported by a Micro Four Thirds body
like the Lumix gh4 but it also adds a
full stop of aperture so does really
well in low-light situations which is
great for Computex because a lot of
these vendors have you know LEDs on
their products they want to show off so
they purposely dimmed the lights down
low so that you know the colors can pop
more and it can get really difficult to
try to shoot in that environment so
having the speed booster on there is
really nice it's also an active adapter
so you can adjust the aperture straight
from the camera body which a passive
adapter will not allow you to do it also
adds some magnification properties to
the lens so that you get more of a wider
field of view in a more cinematic look
to all your shots it's a really great
piece of hardware I've also got the
tascam dr-40 or actually before this
I've got a cage I've got the D cage from
D focus systems this is what the the
Swiss cheese looking crap that's all
around the sides of my my body here and
this thing is just an excellent piece of
hardware it allows you to attach things
like a handle if you guys have a DSLR
and you guys are going on events buy a
frickin handle buy a cage and buy a
handle because I swear to god it's the
best investment I've ever made for for
this particular setup it's just amazing
how much of a difference it makes to
have something to grab on to and she
said and just be able to roam around
freely with E so that's really nice
those holes that you're seeing those are
all threads so either either 1/4 inch or
3/8 inch threads the tube and standards
for mounting camera shit to things so
I've got my tascam dr-40 PCM recorder
it's got some XLR
inputs which is really nice and this is
gonna be wired from the from my son
Heiser mkh 416 microphone here amazing
shotgun microphone very directional
amazing pickup pattern and just utmost
clarity so this is gonna be wired this
is a XLR going into my dr 40 and then
from the dr for you that's going
straight into the microphone port on my
GH 4 so that way i can just record
everything at the same time don't have
to do any kind of audio/video syncing in
Premiere Pro and I'm editing the footage
it's gonna save me a lot of time and
it's gonna sound and look really good
while it does it so really happy about
that setup almost forgot about my 256
gig PNY SD cards there hell yeah
highest-rated class and all that sort of
thing
we've also got a monopod now this is the
Manfrotto 290 and this is a cheapy
little monopod that's probably like 60
70 bucks and I actually have another one
on the way I actually got the same one
that Paul did I bought it last night or
yesterday during awesome hardware right
before the show started because I really
liked his monopod it's the one that's
got like three legs and it's a
self-standing monopod so you can kind of
just leave it there even with the camera
on and mount it and everything it'll
just stand in place which I really like
so I don't know if it's gonna get here
in time I my flight leaves at 12:50 a.m.
later tonight so I have to be out of
here by around 7:30 or so to get through
customs and whatnot on time so we'll see
we'll see it's a race against the clock
whether or not I get the upgraded
monopod but if not this one will do the
job
I'm also got just a few other
accessories here so pair of earbuds
these are nice to have on a plane if you
just want to jack into the in-flight
entertainment you usually do need a 3.5
millimeter jack to do that however if
I'm going to be connecting to my tablet
or my laptop especially when I'm gaming
or whatever watching movies I like to
have a pair of wireless headphones so
these are the sound Pete's q7 why I
believe
and these are just really cheap II
earbuds but they work really well they
go behind your the cable goes behind
your neck so you don't have to deal with
you know any kind of a cable in front of
you like you like you would with a
standard pair of earbuds they sound
really good for the price again they're
they're not too high-end or whatever but
they do the job and they've got actual
volume adjustment on the side there
which is nice to see and finally I've
got an Ethernet cable cat6 cable just
you know connecting to whatever
available ports there might be at the
air B&amp;amp;B we're staying at so that's it
those are all the things guys let me
know if I forgot anything what do you
think what do you think of my setup am i
like forgetting something cuz you know
always in the past when I'm traveling I
always know that I'm going to forget
like one important thing and it never
fails
I always forget like one thing Dan
that's what it was this time so maybe
now that I'm asking you guys you can
just make sure that you know I've got my
whole checklist figured out of course I
will be bringing like backup batteries
for the camera and you know the PCM
recorder and all that sort of thing
you know charging cables and whatnot for
my phone I didn't want to really show
that here because it's not really that
important but if there's anything else
crucial that I'm missing here
oh oh I almost forgot this haha see this
good this was gonna be that thing this
was almost the thing that I forgot to
bring on this trip this is just a USB
three card reader from tech republic not
super important that I bring it because
there is a card reader built into the
laptop here however you never know what
if it dies whatever it dies what I'm
gonna do then what I'm going to do I'm
screwed but yeah that's pretty much
gonna do for now guys you can tell them
a little bit frantic right now because
I've got so much to do before I leave in
just a few hours here so thank you very
much for watching be sure to LIKE the
video if you enjoyed it and also let me
know what you want to see Computex
