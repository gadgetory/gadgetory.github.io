extra messed up as opposed to just
normally messed up but we have a lot of
things to do today the first thing is
clean the room because it's a complete
disaster I mean there's tech all over
the place this room has not been
operational for the last couple weeks of
course we've been away in Taipei for
Computex so I haven't really needed to
use it until now I'm finally getting
around to it now no more excuses there's
a couple systems actually quite a few
systems that need to be disassembled I
don't know if I'm actually gonna get
around to disassembling all of them
because that will take forever at least
gonna remove them from the room because
they take up a ton of space so the very
least we'll get this operational so yeah
this is test number one in the long list
of things we have to do today and it's
definitely the least exciting I'm gonna
knock it out of the way first then we
can hopefully move on to slightly more
interesting things alright let's let's
get this ever
all right look at that
brand-spanking-new room good as new
feels so much better I was getting a
little anxious it was just making the
antsy and you know anxiety inducing to
see all the clutter piled up here and
this honestly just creates a much more
open and free work environment that
really gets the creative juices flowing
took only about an hour and a half not
too shabby at this point what oh that's
I'm really sorry honey I promise I'm
gonna take care of all the stuff that's
that's in the living room I anyway now
we got to go fix wifey sauces AC in her
car because it's been out for a while
but it's recently become a huge problem
now that the summertime in California
it's like 100 degrees out right now so
we're gonna go give her car some good
lovin local mechanic down the street go
ahead him build the thing what are you
asking with me right now
are you serious wait my battery died
you've got to be kidding me
that sounds like a change of plan so
taking a look under the hood
quite literally here it looks like the
battery terminals themselves are okay
there's no crazy amount of corrosion but
actually pretty clean they're not loose
or anything I checked both connections
this guy over here as well is looking
fine everything looks fine here so it
just must be that the battery is old I
don't think you've changed this battery
since you got the car right
since 2016 we're gonna have to get a
battery now yay fun life
unexpected challenges alright I guess
we'll take my car or again a little bit
of a late start to the day so instead of
getting the battery first we're actually
gonna go have lunch we don't know what
we want to eat them Thai food yeah cuz
I'm a Thai boy no it's really good this
is yum one sentence actually a glass
noodle salad that was a good chili lime
and cilantro super tangy sour flavor
I got a papaya salad with grilled shrimp
it's got its got papaya this is the most
holy thing you could ever do to a green
bean just turn it into pad breaking oh I
just I just thought why he saw sticking
out like will peanuts and stuff from my
dish just chomping on them and and she
she completely overlooked the fact that
this is this fish sauce in here just not
vegan and you are officially a murderer
just don't understand how you sleep at
night that peanut was cooked in blood
how get in the zone out of ozone I'm
gonna sing it with me get in the zone
I'm singing alone here leaving me
hanging get in the zone autozone we
gotta say autozone at the same time get
in the zone autozone give me the camera
all right it's time to swap the battery
out of this old car things you'll need
include a wrench just a wrench let's get
started so I'm gonna undo the terminals
first so you got your positive and your
ground and go with this guy it's just
little little nut you know how it goes
just go and do it till it pops off like
that positive terminal and looks like
that like a rat poop in your car oh my
gosh that is like rat poop it looks like
poop
how did that happen though because this
has a cover is that really poop oh yeah
it's definitely poop how how was that
even possible I don't wanna touch poop
with the wrench I don't you can't pick
up poop with a wrench no don't don't do
that with my wrench
I don't poop on my wrench this is a good
wrench it's your own wrench for poop
scooping alright got this sucker loose
removed easy see see how effortless I
just made that seam now it looks like we
can probably just lift this battery out
no that's not gonna work it looks like
we have to remove this guy in order to
do that there is a bolt way down there
filming there way down there you see the
bolt yeah how how would we access that
are you sure that's the beam yure undo
that bolt
yeah so we can't do this today can we
good we don't have the tools for that
wait huh so you need a socket wrench
right yeah remember when you were trying
to fix your tire you bought a bunch of
socket wrenches let's look okay so I
found a ratchet and we even have a set
of sockets available but we are lacking
the long arm adapter forgive my lack of
terminology knowledge here when it comes
to these sorts of things the long stick
the the adapter that'll make this socket
longer so that we can actually reach in
here and reach that bolt so we have to
make another pit stop beer back oh and I
got it the extension of course it's
called an extension obviously carry on
alright let's go in here a couple of
these now you can take this useless
sleeve off now we can extract the
battery huh
new batteries in let's tighten that hair
look manly no you don't know pretty
attractive no all right - its fire it up
come on baby
mama's got a brand new car look at her
like a champ oh yeah now we're exactly
where we started at the beginning of the
video where you still need AC and we
can't really drive your car still
because it's too damn hot outside I
guess I'll have to circle back to
getting your a/c fix sorry honey what
now yeah I got no more fight left in me
let's go especially with a dance like
that I mean how could I how could I say
no
oh what's going on here what is that I
didn't know you put that in my trunk
what is this you gotta wet you have a
wagon for farmers markets you're such an
old lady
you're like Melisandre you like this
super old lady and inside but you're
super hot and feisty on the outside I
lock the car alright those of you
wondering out ers three I get that in
the comments a lot yeah it's it's good
car I like that car with all those
cookies oh my god so many cookies I
don't know there were cookie farmers
here this is amazing did you see how
many cookies that guy farmed yeah folks
I'm amazed Tomatoes her and they are
totally in season tomatoes are so hot
right now I mean look how mint the mint
looks I don't know if I would eat that
this is a Jewish vegetable right yeah
like you know show it chill them that's
what that comes from right I love how
some of the produce here comes with the
pet but you get a free complimentary pet
with your mentor I'm floating on a cloud
okay a life rescue in progress what
should we name you what do you look like
so Charlie and I were thinking that a
nice cold beverage sounds pretty good
right about now isn't that right charlie
yeah he's he grace no bad
well if you didn't take him off someone
would have taken him home and put him in
a blender or something would have been
someone's salsa let's go for a walk
Charlie Charlie's getting rambunctious
oh shoot is he going off leaf he's going
off leaf no stay on the leaf buddy
everything outside the leaf is trying to
kill you I guarantee you can't eat that
bag there's nothing good out here just
go back to the leaf oh boy he's gone
AWOL
we're kind of debating right now whether
or not we should put Charlie in this
planter might be sauce thinks that he'll
actually enjoy eating some of the leaves
there we don't know what those leaves
are but my concern is that the planter
is a little small and I just don't know
if it gives him a lot of playroom you
know like I don't know if he's gonna be
able to I understand that but he has
feelings I just know if I was in a spot
that small I would I feel a little
cramped how about when we walk past the
library okay okay yeah I feel better
about that if I need a good home buddy
let's get Charlie a cute kid charlie and
hope you're not too offended and I
ordered a caterpillar roll that's
nothing to do with your own kind I
guarantee no caterpillars are delicious
why Vsauce did a quick Google search and
realized that nothing in that planter
was edible - Charlie apparently he only
eats like dill and carrots is very
particular they realize caterpillars
were so picky so we've actually decided
to adopt him at least until he's become
a butterfly and then we'll set it free
to the wild we're going home charlie
going home look at us working his
teammates you load the car while I take
care of the kids
parenting's not that hard we have
breaking news folks what just happened
Charlie this is digestive tract is
working that's good news that's that's
our son's first poop assuming he's a he
he might be Charlet Charlie's a girl's
name - oh yeah charlie is a good thing
we picked the unisex name charlie he
stopped pooping on mom we gave you a
napkin napkin that's literally 50 times
your size you could have pooped on that
this is just a reflection of our failure
as parents I take it back parenting is
difficult I can't believe this I can't
believe we're actually going to Petco
for a friggin caterpillar one studio
apartment check what anytime wife he
makes a face like that in the pet store
it means there's a bird she likes
because she is a crazy bird lady oh is
it you birdy I don't get it I don't get
it I don't get birds so I don't get why
birds are cool why people love birds so
much I wouldn't even say they're
overrated because it doesn't seem like
that many people like birds it seems
like they're perfectly rated so they're
probably just looking at Charlie
thinking wow that thing looks delicious
I cannot wait to read my beak around
that Liam they're like oh my god I
haven't seen something like that since
the wild wow look at that
oh he's happy so this is organic food
great yes okay does that mean there
still could be some pesticide and I hope
that okay so he you might die I mean
just cuz you kill your kid doesn't mean
that you're bad parents right Cheers
it's good Nebel yeah well I don't know
about the chill Parkman is talking about
relaxing you yeah YouTube algorithm
won't interpret it that way Amazon and
chill would be fine Netflix and hang
there you go alright yeah oh
cover your eyes buddy yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
