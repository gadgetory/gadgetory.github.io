dude it's too noisy I can't sleep do I
at least get a bedtime story fine once
upon a time there was a tiny little boy
who couldn't fall asleep loud noises
scared him and made him wet the bed
everyone goes their own pace cough
anyway one day the little boy found a
magical cake called the define T by
crackle design impressed by the
minimalistic Scandinavian design he
hopped aside to investigators the
interior the case was rooming without
being too big offering plenty of room
for him to frolic and play the little
boy was amazed a full-length psuche raft
an ample cooing airport and then he saw
whole walls for all the liquid cooling
here the best part was a large side
panel window so he didn't have to be
afraid of the dark
the little boy built happily ever after
the case your dreams is finally here
click the link of the description to
learn more about the defined see from
fractal design
okay-y Vsauce just left she's going to
go pick up us k me like X processor for
me from gigabytes because they're kind
of up to let me borrow a sample but in
the meantime I am setting up a prank so
here we have of course here's new k 68
this just came in she has not seen maybe
she saw the box or something but she
certainly did not notice this little
icon it says that this unit is dust and
spill resistant so what we're going to
do is we're going to take this keyboard
which looks sort of similar to her
existing k75 this is her daily driver
this is her desk I'm going to swap out
both these
keyboards and when she least expected
I'm going to come by and just spill like
accidentally spill a ton of water like a
full-on jug of water all over her
keyboard her keyboard making her think
that I've just destroyed it and she'll
be really angry at me it should be
pretty fun I never prank her so I'm
really excited to be doing it for once
and I think she's going to be very very
very upset with me which is exactly what
Oh ah she's here oh yeah yeah you came
back with stuff thank you very much by
the way for picking this stuff up from
gigabyte he says it's very important he
want you to know this is deleted oh it
is I won't put it in the blog honey
Thanks I've just been drinking water at
your home shoot I I'm so sorry I didn't
mean to do that but this is good blog
material I don't know what just happened
can you get it can you get it
no I'm not kidding you please before the
keyboard dies I literally just spilt
water all over it
why would you do that on purpose do you
really think why would I do that on
purpose
I I honestly did not even know what it
just fell out of my hands is this your
plan no this is not my plan not my plan
can you see if the keyboard still works
have you did you did you notice did you
notice that that's not your keyboard
that's that's a spill-proof keyboard I
just wonder why you're out my desk well
yeah what are you thinking right well we
had an ant problem this morning that I
had to take care of and now we're gonna
have like a keyboard broken and I
thought it was really weird that you're
filming your cup of water I was like
interested why it's not selling a cup of
good what am i cleaning up this mess in
you made it because you are waters good
for everything almost everything uh
what's happening here maybe it's not
alright wait why is it Wiggin out oh oh
it's going crazy
hold on I mean we need to unplug the
keyboard unplug it so maybe we didn't
break the keyboard
wait till it's fully dry and then we can
plug it back in because right now it's
acting like it's possessed again why you
broke it because because I'm holding the
camera here's your old keyboard
meanwhile I guess we'll just let the
keys on this dry as well as the board
itself it I might have might have went a
little heavy on the spillage yeah yeah
sorry about that Corsair so well we'll
see we'll see if it works afterwards
well actually plug it in once it's all
dried off but I say we I say we go eat
go eat some food well gasping food what
are we doing afterward what about it
yeah it's like the beach yes but a
speech why would we do that because the
beautiful day out we can film some fun
stuff they can fly the drone at the
beach no that's not the dumbest of the
dumb is a great idea it's blazing hot
yeah but it's actually much cooler at
the beach still nice I have these nice
ocean breeze we could we could just play
GTA 5 they have Venice Beach in that
game oh yeah it's like a baby excited
contributing all your viewers all your
viewers want to see how beautiful
California beaches are no they've all
played GTA 5 there's no but in real life
oh right 4k with anti-aliasing cranked
up to 8x that's better than real life
okay not everyone knows this seriously
you want to go to Venice I think it's a
great idea what do you guys think that's
not you don't get to control what they
say with the camera movements no fariko
this good guys eat it all I will
so here at Venice Beach you can see
actually area of operation for the folks
at snapchat
I should probably snapchat this I don't
know anymore what do we not let it be
knocked on the door and then people
probably just like like us just kept
vlogging in front of it and they got
really pissed and they remove design.you
we probably know what's going on with
snapchat if we follow them on snapchat
they're always watching
are you seriously hungry right now
we had like a gallon of ice cream I'll
give you two options things we can do
right now we can either a get a piercing
or we get a med card together cricket
ball oh Jesus I was hoping you wouldn't
think of that okay let's do both while
Heather Shazam's the song that's playing
here in the doctor's office I just want
to point out that they are using
Logitech c920 which is a fantastic
webcam to do all of your photo ID taping
oh my god we actually got one
we actually got med cards honey we don't
even smoke weed what are we what are we
doing what the heck are we doing I mean
well we have to smoke now what was your
experience like getting a mid card here
in California for people who don't know
what it's like I was surprised how easy
was but to be honest I was actually
being 100% truthful with the reasons why
I want to undo you were
that's what they all say so what reason
did you give for you know why you need
to read so bad like waving your shoes
that night it's true and you have always
been into more holistic methods of
medicine yeah mine was like
stress-related and and insomnia which
kind of go hand in hand I get super
stressed out from work and from all of
you guys watching now I'm just kidding
you guys are great alright now we now we
got to get a piercing right yeah oh my
god what are we what are we doing feel
hopeless the last time I got a piercing
was the only piercings I've ever got

colonial nice Baltimore Neely go all
