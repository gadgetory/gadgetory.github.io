brought to you by fantex Coolermaster
gigabyte enter max team group NZXT and
corsair to learn more about our sponsors
click on the links below so this is the
tried and true straight power 11 from be
quiet and it's 80 plus gold certified
this is not a new power supply this is a
very very well-known and very respected
unit however people want more people
want they always want more insatiable
wants and needs so be quiet heard the
call they heard the cries and delivered
a straight power 1180 + platinum so
pretty much the exact same specs all
same technical specs on the sheet of
paper still fully modular but just 80
plus gold certified even had the same
exterior look because let's face it
these these units are absolutely
gorgeous why change them just pump up
the power efficiency significantly slept
at $15 price premium on it and call it a
day here we have a brand new case from
be quiet this is the pure base 500 so
that's just one step below the PA 600
but it's got a completely reinvented
internal design the chassis is
completely new from the ground up yeah
we'll talk about that in just a moment
but you can see from the outside here we
have sort of a closed-off front panel
apart from the pretty nice wide
ventilation on the sides here it's on
either side and there's actually dust
filters little dust filter strips that
are just underneath here all you have to
do is remove the front panel pop those
off you can even pop them in the
dishwasher to get them extra clean we
also have a very nice little SSD
mounting solution here you can actually
mount to two SSDs or two tuna -
strategies right here and then you
actually route them behind this little
be quiet plate for a very seamless cable
routing actually pretty handy power
supply shroud looking pretty good lots
of ventilation at the top which is great
in case you need to mount your fan your
higher supply fan upwards for whatever
reason we also have support for three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiators
at the front of the case but included
you actually get two 140 millimeter pure
wings two fans one of the front one of
the back actually fairly premium fans
that are included with with a relatively
budget entry-level case that's just
starting at I believe 79 US dollars
that's 79 US dollars if you go for the
isolated side panel there but if you
want a side panel window that's gonna
cost you a 10 additional dollars there's
also a $5 premium if you want the gray
version which looks very nice I don't
know if this is the final color or not
but looks looks very it's very sexy
going back
the black one here we have a removable
top mesh filter so you could actually
optimize this for silence or airflow
they got the mesh on this one they have
a more closed off one right here very
easy to remove and replace all magnetic
we actually have mounting points for two
hundred and forty millimeter radiators
up top which is very handy you can see
there's also plenty of space for Kayla
routing to make things extra tidy this
is an SSD tray so why don't we go about
the backside here two more mounts for
two and a half inch drives this is just
sort of a backside this is where your
SSD cables will come through if you're
mounting them on the opposite side of
that plate very nice power supply should
have with tons of room this is a two to
drive cage so you can actually do two
and a half inch or two three and a half
inch drives it actually lets you slide
it over towards the power supply
slightly if you wanted to fit a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
with a couple of fans or I guess a few
fans there that would be very easy to do
in a case like this several tight on
points nice velcro straps all included
and seemingly very good build quality
for the price front i/o include power
headphone and mic and two USB 3.0 no
frills here obviously USB type-c would
have been kind of expensive for a case
at this price point so they've omitted
it which again for the price I don't
think is a huge deal but wait there's
more perhaps my favorite iteration of
this case is the white version this this
is cool I mean I think with with a lot
of be quiet cases we've typically seen
the white versions of cases come well
after the initial launch but here I
think we're actually going to get a
white case right from the get-go of the
peer-based 500 which i think looks the
best out of all three if I'm if I'm
being honest it could just be that the
everyone's fingerprints is on all these
products but I love the contrast here
how they've kept the ventilation on the
sides black looks a very nice indeed
look forward to these cases coming
sometime in September of this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
