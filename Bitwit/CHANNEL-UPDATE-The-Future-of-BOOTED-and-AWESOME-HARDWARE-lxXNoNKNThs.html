a better week than I am right now
because I have some bad news
for the channel and its current state
earlier this week I was notified by
YouTube that a video I had posted two
years ago had just been removed
due to a copyright claim and the video
basically featured gameplay footage of
me and my buddy Steve playing Mario Kart
8 on the Nintendo Wii U I guess that's
what I get for playing a console game
but um not only was the video taken down
immediately but the claim also branded
awesomesauce Network with its first
copyright strike now according to
YouTube any channel that receives three
of these strikes will be permanently
shut down without so much as a courtesy
notice so the fact that a loose
copyright claim can put a strike on my
or anyone else's YouTube channel is
pretty frickin terrifying
now clearly YouTube's free use policy
which is supposed to protect creators
like myself is a completely broken
system and I could spend the next 10
minutes talking about all that but the
point of this video is really to update
you guys on what changes are being put
into effect due to this bogus claim so
because now I have because I now have a
strike on my record YouTube's place the
channel under bad standing until
September 13th of this year so apart
from now being on YouTube list
which I can totally handle actually the
biggest impact here is that for the next
six months my ability to livestream
anything to YouTube has been restricted
and after learning this I immediately
contacted fullscreen who's my
multi-channel network that's basically a
mediator between me and tube and
they replied saying that they're going
to investigate the issue and get back to
me
so obviously I'm hoping that they can
get rid of the strike or at least lift
the streaming restriction so that my
live shows like awesome hardware and
booted aren't affected by this in any
way but until I hear any potential good
news from them the current plan is to
start streaming both shows exclusively
to twitch so booted would air on
twitch.tv slash awesomesauce network and
awesome hardware would stream to twitch
TV
/ awesome hardware so come Monday or
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time if you
don't see either show starting on
YouTube then head over to twitch that's
where they'll they'll be airing also be
uploading the rebroadcast of both shows
to YouTube the day after they air so if
you want you can watch them pre-recorded
on this God forsaken platform now again
I have no idea what kind of reply I'll
get from the full-screen guys so if you
want frequent updates as more details
begin to surface you can follow me on
twitter at forever kyle one good thing
in all of this is that all my other
content won't be affected in any way so
expect no changes there but that's going
to do it for now guys thank you all for
your patience and understanding during
this crappy time for the channel but if
you'll excuse me I'm gonna go sign a
vessel contract or something anyway see
you guys later have a go on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
