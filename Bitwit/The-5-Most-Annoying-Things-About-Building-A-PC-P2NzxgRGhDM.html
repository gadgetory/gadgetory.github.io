channel
since I've been feeling a bit under the
weather lately we're gonna keep today's
video on the short side while I load up
on fluids for a speedy recovery the
amount of vitamin C in the citrus ale is
simply amazing so when talking to
non-techies I often compare the task of
building a PC to assembling a box of
Legos or building a set of IKEA
furniture and while it's not as
intimidating as everyone thinks most PC
builds do share a number of special
challenges that I'm sure we seasoned
builders can all agree suck major
cojones so here are the top 5 most
annoying things about building a PC in
no particular order number 1 on our list
is those blasted front panel connectors
getting your cases power reset and LEDs
wired properly is an important part of
the build process but trying to plug
those tiny wires into their tinier pins
on the motherboard is like jumping from
an airplane and landing inside a pair of
skinny jeans to save yourself the agony
some motherboards include FPC adaptors
for easier installation but they're not
always compatible with the unique pin
layouts of other boards which adds a
whole other layer of hatred I have for
these little assholes while we're on the
riveting topic of wires next up we have
the less common but ever just as
aggravating molex connector these
wretched bastards don't come around as
much as they used to thankfully but
seeing them on the occasional budget
case fan or motherboard it's like
running into an old acquaintance you
never hope to see again do we really
have to interact right now and you look
worse every time I see you our thoughts
that come to mind on both accounts
plugging to mullux connectors together
is such an awkward and fidgety
experience you'd swear was their first
time and pulling out is just as
ungraceful to top things off there's few
things worse than forking out the extra
dough on a modular power supply only to
find that you still need to use a molex
cable because one of your devices has
special needs for now we can only hope
that one day SATA or a similar standard
will be the final nail in this
connectors coffin truth be told I have a
soft spot for this next grievance on our
list but in the right or wrong
environment cable management can be a
nuisance whether you're building in a
small case or you simply have a lot of
internally connected devices grouping
cables of varying length and size takes
time and patience and for builders who
find the task too heavy there's vomit in
their chassis already mom's spaghetti
well you could take the coward's way out
by Savage
shoving cables behind the motherboard
tray and forcing the side panel shut
you'll still need to find ways to neatly
route your fan cables to the motherboard
headers if you want a clean-looking
frontside the cabling from your CPU
cooler in particular is a bane because
it can't always hide behind the
motherboard tray leaving it more exposed
than Bill Cosby feel free to check out
my cable management video which I assure
you has more substance than the one
you're watching another annoyance and PC
building that's often overlooked is the
order of operations for installing
components certain cases are more
exacting about this than others but
having to uninstall a part in order to
mount another is worse than aids I mean
all they do is sit in the classroom and
stare at their phones anyway honestly
though having to control-z your build
process is precious time and energy that
could have been wasted on sitting at
your fully built desktop let this be a
lesson to all of you to read the user's
manual as you go about your built
despite user manuals being the sixth
most annoying thing from this list that
brings us to our fifth and final curse
of the PC build which is the aftermarket
CPU cooler and some of you might argue
this caveat is being worse than all the
others combined different mounting
mechanisms for every cooler and socket
type having to sort between AMD and
Intel accessories and needing to reapply
thermal paste to your CPU if you mess up
can drive a man to do unimaginable
things okay maybe I wouldn't go that far
granted some coolers are super easy to
install but I've also had my fair share
of ragequit moments when trying to mount
a heatsink on to $1,000 a core CPU with
a fisher-price toolkit not to mention
the awkward sprawl your fingers need to
make when holding a backplate in place
while you screw it down from the other
side it's like playing twister with
yourself except the CPU cooler is the
only button your face that being said
building a PC is one of the most
pleasant and rewarding things you can do
for yourself or a loved one guys if I
left anything out be sure to blow up the
comments section below with all the beef
you have a PC building and don't forget
to toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it as always I'm Cowell
