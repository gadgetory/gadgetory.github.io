hardware Samara RepA sewed 147 the tech
news show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware we also stream it in two halves
on the youtubes I was off it actually
started like four seconds after dammit
dad
dammit sorry guys mr. countdown Oh
YouTube go watch the rebroadcast on
Twitch of this episode and you'll you'll
know that I was right on time so
broadcasts the whole thing to stop TV /
awesome hardware yes and we also stream
it to YouTube this week is gonna be on
my half or my channel first the first
half the first half of today's show will
be on my youtube channel the second half
will be on Paul's channel sorry we're
not drunk yet my thoughts right now
Jesus but yeah we'd like to have a lot
of fun occasionally will will swear and
and say some potty potty words so if you
have little ones around make sure that
they don't hear anything we say adult
language warning yes
incoming we're drink beer so Cheers
feel free to join us or not if you're
not into that that's fine too you can
pound waters with us all day long we
don't care please drink responsibly and
what are we drinking right now I'm a
Dale's Pale Ale for most paleo Oskar
Blues finishing off the belching beaver
blonde but we also have an ale Smith's
peel a stout so yeah Paul surprised me
with this just now when I crack that one
of my favorites out Simon had an ageist
moment is illegally the last time I had
this was when I did the drunk filled
with a with wacky sauce at Asda that's a
classic I pounded one of these and then
just started hammering back a bottle of
basil Hayden and people later you people
question if I was drunk in that video
attacking okay hey so let's let's talk
about our stores so that you guys can
buy things help us out be armed at
daddy's purchase merchandise if you want
to support us and get cool merchandise
yes my store is bit with tech slash
store
I have a couple new bottle openers up
based on some very popular designs from
some of my shirts there's the game
revolution one it opens bottles it's
very functional with the touch of form
and new stuff that I rip gamepad shirt
is also for sale and it's only 20 bucks
very good quality also very slimming
looks like it's very slimming yeah you
will look ten pounds lighter wearing
this shirt if you want to but oh yeah
that'll buy from my store it's that's
very similar to Kyle store but pulsar
Burnett is where you can go for that and
I have some new stuff maybe not yet
coming soon all right I have new stuff
coming soon but in the meantime I have
all the really cool stuff which includes
polish roots news you can get polish
shirt some to wear at work to show off
that you watch this show also light
titties and bottle openers and all that
good stuff great for polo players thank
you for supporting our shows if you do
we will shout your name out at the end
of the show and you'll Justice fashion
that's great yep so we're gonna kick
things off today with some Pitt my PC
we're just gonna dive right into some of
the submissions that you guys have
submitted and today's episode is or
today's segment is really gonna be a
dedication to hotline my custom water
cooled PC which recently suffered a
catastrophic leak and we'll be talking
about that a bit more later on the show
time that in everywhere now yep yep so
in its honor the rape hotline inversion
this is a really hot line version of hit
my PC as Paul just mentioned where we
only talk about custom water fold
submissions so I think you guys for
submitting those we'll start off with
Jose Jose not Cuervo
but just Jose from Twitter gray roots
he's got a 77 hundred K 16 gigs of
Corsair LED ddr4 a GTX 1080 founders
Edition and ROG Maximus 9 and some ek
water blocks in there rigid tubing look
at that so he's got black I'm thinking
that's black yeah it's definitely black
tubing
maybe got some distilled water in there
cool and things up oh all right
that's cool I can appreciate I can
appreciate the distilled water liquid
cool build much simpler when it comes to
cleaning and maintenance yeah a lot less
likelihood of anything growing in your
loop as long as you use a little a
little killer whale kill kill coil we
kill coil over that's that's an option
you can use the bad side stuffs that you
just put some drops in there and
whatever but yeah that works very very
clean looking yeah the distilled water
look there's also great you know like
Paul said very low maintenance
especially if you're if you're using the
tubes themselves or colored tubes for
for your aesthetic and which you know
blacks definitely making a statement now
what was I gonna say the black Ivan so
I've seen black tubing before this is
pretty much a black rigid tubing so I
guess does it come black yeah why not
and there you do you bend it I haven't
seen much colored ptg or acrylic tubing
but and I haven't gotten that far into
into into water color you could bend it
and then paint it oh I see so you're
thinking maybe he's done a DIY thing
here no I'm I'm pretty sure like I
remember seeing like different colored
rigid tubing looking for bad and I was
looking for tubing and stuff for the
elite build so yeah I'm fairly positive
that's it just comes that way
well cool should be that difficult but
it definitely looks really nice and I
don't really have much else to critique
here I actually don't think I could
teach you at all okay I have one
critique and we'll move on maybe a
longer reservoir tube because you have a
lot of sealing room there I think you
could just fill in that empty space
there's a lot of empty space above your
reservoir and having maybe a longer tube
I don't know what would fit 200
millimeters maybe would definitely fill
the case out but put some black fluid in
there this impact just have the whole
reservoir just completely filled with
black fluid called the sewage build I
don't know
I haven't seen many have you seen many
custom water-cooled systems with black
fluid no I don't know how you'd make
black fluid I think I'm sure you just
throw dirt in it or something it's
probably good for the loop I have to do
an experiment with that maybe video
maybe we will okay I'm up but thank you
very much Jose next we have David not
seeing David from David and Goliath but
David from Twitter
7900 X at 4.9 gigahertz deleted mind you
with an Asus Rampage 6 extreme 32 gigs
of g.skill RGB let's tread and Z and the
GTX Titan X little P very very nice wait
I've got some RGB action in here in a
thermal take case and that very nice
water block for the that motherboard is
it's always really cool although I don't
know why it's not lit up cuz that
technically I think that water block
definitely has RGB in it so I don't know
went round there but I'm on the water
block oh yeah yeah you should have some
RGB yeah you're at the lights out or
maybe it's not plugged in maybe maybe
ran out of headers on your motherboard
or something but looks pretty good I'm
always perplexed when I see like cable
extensions of a specific color or cable
sleeves of a specific color with RGB
lighting because it doesn't really it's
not color neutral which kind of limits
being or kind of clashes I guess so
maybe that would be my tip I feel like
with RGB white reflects obviously the
most light so if you really want things
to shine and and look good all around no
matter what color you're changing your
LEDs to I think white sleeping Y cables
looks looks really nice you can get some
professionally done ones or you know
cable mod pro cables or whatever I like
this just bend over here I do tubes this
exit Bend it's kind of it's a really
nice workaround for this very common
issue of trying to hook up that GPU
fitting to the CPU block
cuz they're not perfectly straight and
aligned so you end up either having to
like do this weird sort of like squiggle
over to the left or the right a little
bit it's just hard to do it which is
hard with intention and and it's hard to
do and even if you do it perfectly it
doesn't look that great so I really like
that you've kind of gone this creative
route it looks a lot better I think fill
up your reservoir yeah that would be
that's the only critique that I would
have her say you had one filter it's
everything else looks really nice or
maybe don't fill up the rez because
maybe your systems moments away from
leaking horribly and you want to have as
little fluid in your system as possible
well you can see he put a drain here at
the bottom of the system which means he
performs regular maintenance on his like
a cool assistant well that's stupid
who'd do that I know it's weird it's
weird have terrible maintenance this
will have it one of those things old
systems you have it all right next up is
Salle's Salazar yeah this is Greek
science studio whitey Greg from Salazar
assign studio sorry
at least Salazar studio but he's been
working with the the new Liam Lee 0:11
dynamic case and he's a he's actually
taking a pretty serious stab at
reviewing this case I think with
actually putting a custom loop in it
grant it's just the secret but he's
going the extra mile here and I really
like the all-white theme he has done a I
mean why won't your white build in the
past I believe that was very nice as
well why would you even bother to watch
like the hardware connects review on
this case right watch Greg's review
where he did an actual water cold goes
ah doubt Greg's idea will have this much
porn hardware porn as Hardware connexes
but you know III suggest watching both
videos when you can no you can't watch
both choose one or the other
yeah I mean who's gonna watch two videos
in the same case everyone who's gonna
watch two videos on second gen Rison
with service Co life everyone ever
obviously that's a very important topic
that lots of people have
a lot of interests is an important case
this is this is an important case
because it's a code developed and
co-designed by with a de Brouwer yeah
roman professional mocker yeah and then
Jordan if you guys haven't seen it and I
I didn't happen to watch the hardware
connects your view on this case I
couldn't watch Gregg's because he hasn't
made his video yet because he's doing
the water cool build in it yeah but he
will have a video on it yeah what the
water-cooled built but Dimitri was very
very complimentary of the case they did
it you did a good job
mm-hmm and this build was looking pretty
sweet you know what I like this yeah I
was gonna say just I mean the orange
accents on the on the graphics card is
the only thing that I I mean it's it's
all way build so it's the only color
accents you know he I don't know why he
didn't include an angled like a
45-degree angle but if you look at the
RAM close-up it also has orange Jack's
like the Rams are in Jackson's okay then
it's alright yeah if that's the accent
color feel the build in fact right and I
do agree with you though that even
though the the RAM and the GPU have some
orange accents and I think just like a
sliver of orange in the cable sleeving
what a bit would have made it like oh
you know and but the back and forth um
but it's incredibly clean I love the
bends the bends are great the bend
closer to us looks a little bit less
extreme than the one behind it but it's
a very minor gripe if I have to point
out anything they're not saying and the
the tube that's closer to us it looks
like it has a more gradual Bend and the
one behind it has a more aggressiveness
gentle this is a tighter a tighter
ninety there yes a tighter ninety okay
so that I mean if I'm being nitpicky but
overall this is it looks perfectly
straight both cubes are perfectly
straight and drag you gotta redo this
scrap the whole thing Rize the whole
bill shoots really and off of your desk
until it just becomes like humming yeah
I agree with with Kyle that's the only
thing that's it's looking this it's
really hard to do critiques with this
with this addition yeah of tip my PCB
grace everything's looking so clean and
nice
very nice diggin it alright let's move
on to JQ j qu once again I'm not gonna
have much to say about this one other
than another Lili case this is the V
3000 been out for a while now in 1950 ex
I love that this is a thread rebelled 64
gigs of DDR 4 with a Titan XP yeah SLI
to emetic lighting holy crap and he's
got a Sound Blaster AE v sound card in
there which is obviously the highlight
of this bill where I it's not just below
they just belittle the bottom card down
here okay yeah
but holy cool what I can't yeah it is
definitely tactics no image I still
don't understand why on Twitter
sometimes you can right click and view
image and other times you cannot it's
like this I think it's because this is -
right it's two pictures yeah but
whatever are you talking to zoom yeah
well when I can when I can view the
image like this yeah just the image then
I can I can make him rice - and zoom in
on and stuff do you have actual zoom if
you want to do man that's it that's a
really cool build very you got a dual
loop is it they're separate right I
don't know they're there
there it is all the same table some one
loop part of the same loop but you've
got dual pumps and do dual reservoirs
yeah it's pretty nice lots of details
here like I can tell the reservoir caps
have been put out in such a way that the
labels are facing forward it's a nice
little detail mmm looks like we have an
inline perhaps that is a temperature
temperature gauge right there that
that's that's good to have and also
something yeah
and there's something below it - dad hey
yeah I don't know what that is no no oh
yeah you can see in the other picture
that it also has the temperature readout
one yeah there I guess oh I wonder what
what brand makes that I'm not sure but
this is a very very excess PC block well
done system I like to sleeping a lot
yeah again this is
there's no words make all the fans led
then it'll be perfect yeah needs more
rainbow RGB lighting it's not lit enough
all right okay moving on Brian oh we get
more is our good buddy and pal Brian
from VPS custom we're doing this one
first and he showed me this rig private
he privately deemed me because I'm
special yeah
with a picture of the system and I
almost came out of my office
what case is to tell my wife case is so
impressive it looks like a case limbs
case a damn there are no bends here
believe it or not everything is just a
straight tube that he's cut to size and
used angled fittings to get where he
wants to be but it still looks I really
like the look of systems that do that
it's like cheating it is kind of like
cheating but I don't mind it because it
looks so good I'm just kidding when it's
done it's nice it's usually Martino's
for you that's it because you know each
of these fittings we gonna cost you five
ten bucks yeah if that probably maybe
more eight eight to twelve depends are
you buying anything but damn I really
like the 2-tone going on here the red
and white how you kind of alternated the
fans and similarly sort of like the the
sleeting matches perfectly
I like the dual reservoir side by side I
think that's a really unique look those
heat killer reservoirs holy crap like
with the bars on each side like it just
sort of gives it more of a straight and
angular design than like the very
conventional cylinder I think that kind
of looks cool and different and I
believe he's using pretty much of you
coolant in here yeah I think so so
hopefully it's not for long-term use as
we've seen that's doesn't end well but
very very nice build Brian I'm sure
whatever client you're building this for
us would be very happy almost sweet then
it's for him look it's got his logo on
it
Oh perhaps it is then I'm very jealous
why would you
would you not build it for you hey wait
it's true well done brain all right and
then finally we have rag rag with this
oh yeah system here
oh the rarity rarity build great is the
rarity build we already done um so
obviously this is my little pony
rarity everyone's favorite character
from the show of my personal favorite
maybe we shouldn't we shouldn't admit to
any of this let's see I had to google
both Paul and I had to google what this
character was we have no prior knowledge
of my little pony or any of the
characters in it my little brownie I'm
more of a I'm more of a Dora the
Explorer kind of guy and then hold on
shoot what because I think that I know
the name oven oh oh yeah that is one
yeah that's that's coincidence that's
coincidence it's the same it is yeah
okay Heather wifey sauce went as the for
Halloween that's probably remember that
yeah all right so it's true and it's
trying to pull off a smooth like I'm
more of a Shutterfly I had the name
right now oh you can totally nail it
totally nailed it there's severity
though obviously yeah obviously a
popular and this build is incredibly
detailed and just so well thought out
I love the reservoir and like the cutout
pattern around it it just looks so MLP
as chris is also pretty much feel views
UV sky-blue coolant yep very popular
right now so hot right now
that loves the SSD covers damn and the
GPU backplate obviously looks great I
love how you spray-painted the ek
waterblock they definitely don't come in
white like that and the other end end
cap there and yeah and then the the
fluid choice I think is just
perfect I I wouldn't have thought like
that the purple and the blue would match
so well together but then when I see a
little figurine you have there it it
just it's perfect
so um no real complaints here you even
have like purple panels in the ceiling
of your system you've got a white panel
at the rear yeah I like the cadets on
the reservoir - yeah it's cool right oh
wow you scared me here oh he licked my
arm oh well he's just I just felt like
this white or wet slimy thing on my arm
I thought I was getting attacked by like
that poisonous frog lens that's wet and
slimy wet and slimy like it should be in
the ocean but still can breathe and
exist on land probably a frog right it's
a quick it felt like baby it's really
introduction if you felt like an
amphibious attack that's all I'm saying
okay oh it's okay Deb all right Cheers
toast Oh 12% so we'll sip it slowly huh
all right that concludes pin my piece do
you thank you guys so much for
submitting those beautiful custom looped
systems but let's move on to our next
segment
next segment which is just as
educational as in my piece yeah today
face off pollen I have your flames in a
while but this is where we go
head-to-head in an online two-player
game that's usually amazing I don't even
think your systems gonna be able to run
this game because the graphics are so
good it's a pretty intense game yeah and
tried to get it loaded up before the
show just to make sure everything would
go smoothly cuz you don't want to be saw
in our show as always he had to
overclock his his 18 core system just
just to run this game properly okay so
the game is called curve fever fever
year you'll be red so do left for you
okay
right okay this is B green yep the
premise is very simple but the game is
incredibly complex the mechanism is game
play mechanics are just space
revolutionary are you ready should turn
music could be on yeah sure oh yeah oh
yeah
this is composed by Hans Zimmer Hans
Zimmer does the soundtrack to this game
all right space to continue I'm green
you all right I'm green
oh I'm red you're red I'm green okay
what is this powerup thing oh geez I
don't know that makes me go slower okay
is that good or bad I have no idea
there's gaps that appear every so often
so this actually this is kind of
reminding me of a snake or slither snake
yes but also there's the game called
sliver that's kind of like this no cause
this is kind of like slither if you'd
say oh I'm this trot over trot you this
time yeah it's definitely Tron but
beware even the music is kind of Trani
next time you may not fit oh wait I'm
flat now oh my god I like ate something
oh geez and now I'm can I can I eat this
time no I guess wait oh oh I know you
made me fat oh no oh no oh that was
garbage
oh maybe our second I died not you you
die die die
oh it's best to do it sure yeah let's do
that
all right it's business to continue okay
yes we go this is epic what is that
lightning dude mark my words guys in
like three months you're gonna see this
in like a flurry eSports event this game
will be oh my god the best I like being
a fast bet so oh my god I'm losing
myself
your fishing rod happened in slow motion
right so this one's for all the apples
Oh too much pressure all the apples and
shitman Baba's it's too much pressure
oh man oh come on come on I see what
you're trying to do there I don't know
what this does but I'm getting it ah no
why it's blue I'm going backwards oh you
got a powerup that made me go backwards
so my left was right shoot that was away
I wouldn't know that power just did well
see what I could come back should
practice the game more than you Paul
before we played well that was a very
sorry hit rousing round of a face up I
say very short lived my reign was quick
so alright so um my punishment backstory
here that my wife picked these up and
thought it would be funny to make us
wear them these are green tea face masks
is a face mask sheet it's a mess sheet
supposed to live for 20 minutes but
we're gonna do ten for Kyle it's a skin
purifying and in case you're wondering
there's two of them so it's I mean I'm
gonna end up doing the other one on my
half no once we get to there yeah I feel
like should we have paper towel or
something maybe that goopy it's a little
okay it's goopy so I'm gonna get a paper
towel all that but maybe maybe that's a
good point maybe I'm supposed to absorb
all the juices with my face oh oh why
did people what why is this really gonna
make my face feel that much better where
I'm like I'm glad I put this on my face
for 20 minutes worth it this is very
it's very like delicate maybe some paper
towels trying not to
there's a green tea face mask okay oh I
see I was gonna read what it does but
it's it's in Chinese or Korean
I believe it's Korean because oh you
know there's an imagery you've never
seen any American people directions tear
open and apply it to face leave on for
20 to 30 minutes and then remove for
external use only avoid contact with
eyes okay
really you're literally putting it
directly over your eyes razor so that's
so helpful that they I'm so scared right
know that keep out of reach of children
discontinue of signs of irritation and
or rash appear oh look like MF DOOM but
there's no explanation on here select
Iron Man's nothing on here that tells me
like what benefit this actually does
oh yeah that's is this right I think you
need to attach it more empire oh yeah
I've got a press it down in certain
places yeah especially over your on just
press it right into your eyes under the
cornea it's cold you're tough set into
the into the wastebasket okay well this
is fun let's set the timer for 10
minutes okay please please start it now
I don't have a timer Lucha Libre yes I'm
gonna drive home like this oh yeah I'm
just gonna like and just awkwardly stare
at the person next to me like hello then
we want 10 minutes it doesn't really
stick to them at the lower half of my
face because of my facial hair oh that's
that's they should fix that somehow I've
never used the windows timer should keep
that usually it's helpful it's they they
made they they're like oh smart phones
can do really simple useful easy things
we haven't bothered to get put in there
we should
that too so I have a timer set just down
there in the corner okay
and now we can move on to news right
really quick the important thing though
whether or not they can still drink beer
with the mask on Oh God also I guess if
you have facial hair like it's not
really what I was saying I wasn't paying
attention yeah the lower half of my face
was a little bit loose but that's okay
I'm gonna roll with it alright my hair
will feel amazing after this all right
oh good
so now you can regale us my story of
okay what is it hotline hotline yeah so
I'll just I'll just tell you guys kind
of what happened you through it even
though I just uploaded a video on this
exact thing to floatplane
that's on floor play it'll hit YouTube
in about a week but um basically did you
do an Instagram story I did how do you
look at that I don't I don't know if you
can water Instagram stories from a
desktop on Instagram too and I couldn't
it's definitely on it like mobile I
watched it today I actually saved it and
downloaded today no save it's my phone
that's fancy
uh antsy I could oh you know what it's
in my you know I could just forward it
to you right now and you could play it
on the screen no why why the hell not
hotline Update has been shot it doesn't
look like hotline has been repaired in
this hotline update no I have not
touched or I have not booted up or
disassembled it or really touched you or
filled with it much since the incident
video where you said there's like and
you're like this sucks
ya know that's exactly this happened to
me exactly what the video was and that's
that's what people just want to see
people just want to hear you bitch and
moan about hear about this catastrophe
so this the segment that we're gonna do
right now is really quick
it's very impromptu it's just like
talking about
the biggest your worst tech tech Astra
fee ever
that's tekken catastrophe merged
together I'm a genius so mine tech tech
test Rafi tech tech I put tech Astra fee
but test your feet could work too no
tech Astrakhan tat
oh yeah take a stress test or tech
tester being ticked Astra fee tech caste
Rafi - Rafi so sounds more tactile I
agree like chai MX blues or Browns cuz
they've the bump um it's more
titillating so let's let's talk about
tech test Rafi hotline this is Eileen
this a goop oh yeah that's the worst
picture that's it we're out of almond I
mean there's really not much to say I
walked into my room Friday night or
Saturday night and just there's just a
puddle of pink shit on the carpet it was
terrible it was like ah that's like
that's the other real issue is like my
carpet is fucked and there's pink fluid
all over the place so I walked in i saw
it was like no I look up expecting to
just see like the leak coming from like
one specific area
yeah right like oh maybe it's just one
fitting and it just happened to find its
way to the floor but no fluid was
everywhere this isn't staged and this is
like I even wiped a little bit up this
is mostly for ya it was probably like at
least three quarters maybe a little bit
more full and it's a big reservoir and
it was completely drained when I walked
in the system was still on because I
usually leave my system on even when I'm
afk and so the pump was dry running the
pump was just dry running making this
awful noise
I'm like oh just crime-scene
investigation I immediately pulled the
plug it's funny cuz like dry running a
pump sounds similar to like dry humping
like like if you dry hump and fill your
raw oh it has a similar like it gives me
the similar like that alluding to that
gives me this similar kind of yeah
as dry running the pumps that is an
association but I would not have made
without your help Paul Holmes thank you
for putting that okay mental image in my
mind but no like it it was very
traumatic it was traumatizing I pulled
the plug and it seemed to be running
fine like it was at the windows lock
screen dry-humping that's what I call
driving that term can be applied to
either one lots of time pumping lots of
chafing involved with with the dry
pumping and yeah it turned out to be
that fitting right there the one that's
on top of the terminal this one it was
loose
no the the GPU terminal of this one yeah
the one to the left of it I think this
one yes because when I started like
messing with the fittings I came to that
one and it was really it was a much it
was much looser than the others and the
tube that it's connected to was actually
like half in and half out like it didn't
quite go all the way into the o-ring it
didn't go quite past the o-ring which
explains why it was just like squirting
out from all directions in all
directions and and getting everywhere
now so have you you said you haven't
taken this apart at all no I haven't but
the plan is is to do that and clean
everything to a tee and then rebuild it
and then test it to make sure
everything's running cuz that because I
have a theory here what when when did
you build this two years ago about have
you ever maybe a little have you ever
flushed it mmm once I flushed it once
when in that time that was about midway
between when I first built it and today
and when you flushed it did you actually
take the blocks apart and stuff like the
CPU block and anything I did not take
the actual blocks apart No
okay no right there cuz my theory here
is that your your if your blocks are
clogged enough then it's then this
pressure pressure building up yeah so if
you've got a fitting that's loose then
the pressure building up there's gonna
be cause it costs yeah
exacerbated but it's a very good it's a
very good lesson it is to for for you
know doing that regular cleaning now I
think this could easily have happened to
me when I first cleaned out our fan
third last year like it was in bad shape
yeah but it's just one of those things
like I haven't I haven't run
water-cooled systems along like for an
extended period that long like that was
the first system that really done it was
right time can slip away and suddenly
it's like yeah but yeah it's it's a very
it's a very like you have to commit
yourself to maintaining it and like
flushing it regularly because it's such
an invisible problem like it's not
things can be building up under the
surface and you'll never see it so it's
very easy to just ignore it and be like
well it's working fine right now it's
probably fine yeah but but clearly it
does you know that's one of the one of
the cons I guess you could say of custom
water cooling it does require a lot more
maintenance and regular checkups and
things like that servicing so lesson
learned hopefully knock on wood and in
the follow-up video when I actually
clean everything up and and test it that
there's no lost hardware or at least
very little wear and you got to look at
the positive side here which is that you
know all the people who see this who
have water-cooled systems like should I
be doing this to mine like yeah
Diana's hot box Nana system I need to I
need to I need to maintenance that one
it's a good yeah damn good it hasn't
been running all the time so I don't
think will be too bad but I sure it
definitely needs it and yeah anyone else
who is inspired by this traumatic
experience mm-hmm perhaps will also do
the same yep alright uh what are we what
are you doing um we can we wanted to
check new seconds
do it this is a pretty interesting
article this is from WCC F Tech and it's
about Asus revealing officially
announcing their new Ares Radeon series
of graphics cards this is big news
because this sort of relates to GPP and
also kind of further indicates that GPP
is a real thing essentially asus is
moving all of their Radeon cards away
from the ROG brand and creating this new
Ares line of cards for those AMD GPUs
now Ares a re s is an existing family
line that came out years and years ago
from from Asus yes it is but this is
Ares with a Z at the end instead of it s
true and Z is a different letter a
different letter than s totally
different brand and apparently there's
really no relation other than you know
Asus is just paying some homage to its
older family of of high-end GPUs now
this looks like a radically different
design to the Strix model actually does
not
it looks very similar actually that
looks so it's actually a good point that
you bring up Paul is that really the
branding apparently is the only thing to
really be changed here all the features
of ROG are still gonna get ported over
to ares and you're really not gonna see
me according to the article lots of
performance going you know going from an
ROG card to an Ares card it's simply a
branding thing which is what Cal from
OCP specified in his initial article
that was one of invidious requirements
that the primary the primary gaming
brand of your company blingy blingy
oh is that 10 minutes already that is 10
minutes ago
Wow the timer is up okay unless you want
to leave it on through the full 20 you
know what let's go for the full 20 grand
for the full time yeah looking old
rollin with it brother let's handle it
just make sure you put another two
minutes under otherwise I'll be wearing
it all night yeah yeah
um but yeah that was one of the
requirements and one of the big
requirements for the GPP is that Adam
board partners for example could
had to reserve their top-of-the-line or
their main gaming brand for nvidia cards
solely so this actually answers I mean
this this box art here answers a big
question that I had which is what about
they could put the word gaming on that
and I can which apparently they can
mm-hmm so that tempers my reaction
somewhat I mean if they really were
trying to keep them from saying gaming
on these fucker and AMD brand very
messed up this is still I still kind of
disagree with this like I'd rather that
Nvidia didn't do whatever gpp is doing
that guy is causing this diversion or
whatever it I mean it could be a lot
worse now there's another name out there
that you have to explain that now now
your now your new friends who come in
who are like I want to get into gaming
you're like oh we can get this Ares this
Asus Ares Radeon rx Vegas 64 right Andy
and you're like hope they'd like that
you're like like what where did he get
this asus rog Strix GTX 1080i with an
NVIDIA GPU like Everett like like
there's four brand names now yeah in
those two different cards yep with with
a a wild card of Strix the yeah like
they still got Strix on both of them yep
you notice that unifying brand-name and
so yeah it's it's kind of interesting
and and you you said that you know this
kind of tempers your concerns a little
bit but we have to keep in mind also
that this is just a soos right there's
still MSI gigabyte we don't know exactly
how they're gonna approach the GPP in
fact we kind of do already because MSI
has not unlike Asus they haven't really
created like a specific like cool
sounding gaming brand for their Radeon
based GPUs instead they've just kind of
at least for now just remove the word
gaming from their cars so that's where
is way different than what this is which
so if if the sub brand has the word
gaming
if MSI's sub-brand like RG arguably does
for public of gamers but whatever
MSI the brand is the MSI gaming whatever
then that doesn't mean that they don't
be able to be applied to AMD cards yes
that's weird just just how it matters so
much based on how these Adam board
partners have branded their cards before
GPP existed right now all the sudden
that's actually making a huge difference
in how they're branding it with GPP and
following those is it hard to take me
seriously with this mask on I mean
honestly I wasn't really looking at you
very much just continue not looking at
and everything will be easier oh my god
I look like fucking Jason like terrible
I think you're gonna have such a good
skin but just on this part here like
quite getting out to the bridge of your
nose this I think that's an important oh
yeah I've been trying to work on my nose
bridge parted recently it's part of the
t-zone I know that now okay you want to
make a piano so any of any final other
than will keep a close eye on this and
report to you guys directly if any
updates come to light all the new skews
let's move on to the next segment or
sorry story Facebook this really quick
Facebook admits to trekking non-users
this is something that the zuc mr.
Zuckerberg admitted to in his hearing
last week the court of justice and shit
he was saying that Facebook is tracking
non users of the site even if you're not
a facebook member you're not signed up
with their platform that you might still
have data in the facebook database which
is kind of concerning to a lot of people
obviously for good reason there's a blog
post that was posted recently by
Facebook that offers a bit more details
on on tracking non users specifically
David baser who's the product manager
director at our product management
director at Facebook excuse me said that
when someone visits a site or an app
that simply uses Facebook services like
social plugins
a facebook login Facebook advertising
which is everywhere the site or app
owner doesn't know if
visitors a Facebook user or not and so
it sends all of their info or whatever
info they can gather from them to the
company to Facebook even if you're
logged out of Facebook or you don't even
have a Facebook account so yeah I mean
Oh virtually everyone is affected by
this because how many people go to like
how many websites have you ever been to
that had like the option to log in with
your Facebook account I never do that so
many I never do it either I never do it
either but just the fact that you visit
sites that offer that option means that
if even if you're not a Facebook user
your data could still be and very well
it is in their database which is kind of
concerning there's also like a brand a
type of company whose sole purpose is to
do data collection online and match
visitors to websites with actual names
and addresses so if you on a website and
you get someone on your website you
might not have much data about them you
might only have like an IP address or
something like that but matching that
with an actual person so you can
continue to advertise to them that's
that's the type of company there's
smaller companies but that's what this
type of thing reminds me of because yeah
obviously building building out the
databases of the databases of
information about people that you can
use to mine the data to advertise more
accurately is basically how it's how
it's done these days yep and yet
Facebook continues to to to claims that
they do not sell data and that's not
what they're about and despite them
saying or suggesting that users have
control over their data the blog post
that they posted recently does not say
how to view or delete your data from
Facebook they just say yeah we're
tracking you guys but sorry we're not
gonna give you access to that
and you won't know how to delete it now
Zuckerberg did mention that there was a
download your data option on the website
and he said that you could just do that
just download your data then you can
wipe it but that data doesn't include
everything apparently according to the
article when you go into Facebook they
still have other shit on you that isn't
in
that location so I just I guess it just
stands to reason that if you if you
really could delete all of your data how
would how would Facebook sell it which
is which is probably why they're keeping
keeping some reserved I don't know I
mean I mean we kind of do know we kind
of do know that Facebook is selling data
and maybe it's a little bit complicated
and there's some gray areas involved but
you know they can deny it all they want
it definitely seems they're guilty of a
little bit when I was a kid I was wanted
like just disappear and like fall off
the off the radar you know yeah have
like an alias no one knows who I am
which being visible like that was always
very cool and mysterious to me but I
feel like now that's it's really hard to
be Amish and live in like a forest that
doesn't have a name yeah you need to
have parents that were kind enough to
like completely cut you off from all
connection to the internet and write and
that sort of thing you gotta be like the
characters in the village the parents do
night Shyamalan parents poster you face
on Instagram and every other social
media like the Saran you pop out of the
yeah out of your mom's yeah oh yeah
right that's the thing it's like even it
even when you're an adult
even if you hate Facebook and you never
go online you kill the Internet the
people around you in your life most
likely you're on all the time they're
traitors
they've fucking given up your data yeah
send you off to the Terminator this is a
lost it's a losing battle it's all right
no it's not a losing battle card because
we are here and we're discussing it and
that is helping people know circles from
guru 3d it's about is it twenty minutes
up yet I feel like my skin is we're
gotta you got a minute and twenty three
okay you're sure the time we're still
working it's still good twenty to thirty
minutes so don't worry about going over
it I feel like my flesh is being burnt
off it's good it's actually tingling it
feels like it's just
out - like like when I remove the mask
you'll just see my muscle peel your face
up to see my underlying muscles blood
blood will be everywhere look like when
they feel still great when they open the
arc and then what is this computer part
you're getting cheaper your heart's
getting cheaper I figured I would
sprinkle some good nog
all y'all because Ram prices are fucked
up GPU prices are fucked up but NAND
flash heyo apparently we're having a bit
of an oversupply here is q1 of 2018 so
prices should theoretically drop down a
little bit in the coming months which is
exciting
however demand will increase during
second half 2018 further keepsies and
obviously we've got Black Friday and
holidays and stuff which might switch
back to tight supply so get them while
they're hot people if you can find an
SSD right now some NAND flash device
that is cheap cheaper than usual I might
want to pull the trigger on that sooner
than later before shit goes back up some
manufacturers have responded to the the
trends this year and lower supply we
move up to a 500 gig standard stay
effect 500 snares Oh Kyle hold on
I have sustained Kyle over the 20
memories mask I thought oh don't do that
more slowly what happened there's like
weird things in my mouth
that's friends of beans from the beer
okay I was like do I have herpes like
coz in the mouth region there's like
little brown areas on the corners and
it's from the beer thank god this one
the beer okay it's just the beer beyond
that I mean you look you look kind of
glassy do I yeah I feel blah see there's
a piece of it still oh Jesus can I hang
up can I give it do you have any paper
towel yeah that's not this it's not
already wet it's like a wet why don't
you just dip this in some water
is dip this instead of buying those
masks tell your wife to dip this in some
soapy water and just smack it on her
face it's all you really knows exactly
this thing is exactly the same thing but
then you have two individual oh here oh
don't do that I just saw them put a
corner on his head
okay Wow everything's fine as well as
the camera's not shifting around we're
all good people can't see this cute
puppy face he's so you all right anyway
man's chief man's getting cheaper that
way for long see take advantage okay
here for five hundred and twelve hundred
bucks on a bucks that's for the Patriot
ignite which isn't exactly the lowest
and fastest but I'm mush can source
hey what 500 gig class SSM please buck
down and the hundred one hundred and
twenty dollar range said that is looking
that is looking pretty good
Wow MX 500 500 gig $423 it's pretty
solid that is really good right you you
were having to pay you were having to
pay a hundred plus four for a 250 gig
Yeah right
about a year ago a couple months ago
monster yeah so cool six months yeah
well that's good that's good
all right let's move on to Tom's
Hardware article about Intel documents
hinting at an eight-core coffee like CPU
some redditor spotted a reference in on
the Intel website - a coffee like CPU
with eight cores and integrated graphics
chip you can see the screen shot there
for confirmation it says copy like s
eight plus two oh this could confirm
rumors of an 8-core consumer-level chip
or edit link from intel potentially
based on these e 390 chipset when it
launches which is likely a confirmed
chipset as e 390 indicates that the
chipset wouldn't how many videos does
Tom's Hardware play when I try to go
their website goddammit
Oh God god damn it go away
this oh there's a big X they put the X
right in the middle where the play
button would be so all the places you're
looking for the X aren't there you got
me that time you got me that time Tom
server it was scale of one to tweek town
how bad are the ads on Tom's they're
pretty Greektown
I think we can point fine close okay so
Z Z the Z 390 chipset is still eight
would still be a 300 series chipset
which is allegedly only reserved for 8th
gen Coffee Lake so the success of this
eight core successor if it does exist
might still be eight in each gen coffee
like CPU just using sort of you know
revamped parts z 390 may still support
ninth gens windows come around we'll
probably just see if 400-series chipset
fully optimized for ninth gen and and
the night gen ships would be backwards
compatible was e 390 for example so this
so this potential new Intel chipset Z
390 to get the potential new Intel 8
core main stream processors do you need
the Z 390 chipset motherboard is that
yes yes you need I mean that's what I
would guess but it doesn't say
specifically in the article but it would
be a hell of a way to try to sell and
push the Z 390 chipset it would be a
very Intel white rye to sell and push
the z3 yes it would be incredibly
intelligent so just to clarify when
finally faced with competition from AMD
on the mainstream platform which Intel a
bit sitting on quad core processors
since late 2008 they finally jumped to 6
core and forced people into a new
chipset that it was not even fully
realized the Z 370 chipset which has now
been supplanted by hh-60 whatever that
whatever the stupid cheap zucchini yeah
yeah those new chipsets that came out
what you're like oh we have USB 3.1 and
like 802 that 11ac
but like oh the the Z 370 that came out
last year doesn't yeah so
you had to upgrade your motherboard to
get from four to six cores and now
you're gonna need an upgrade your
motherboard and your motherboard again
to go from six to eight cores if you
really want that on the mainstream
platform yeah or you could have just
gotten the next 299 I guess but those
are reasonably priced yeah okay
AMD's mechanical sure real bad offering
backwards compatibility with Verizon
second gen it's it the business models
that AMD in the marketing models that
AMD have are completely different than
than Intel's and it's really starting to
show it has time now they'd like to poke
Intel they do in the bracele so that
people get pissed off about yeah totally
I would take I would do like the rise
like the rising to stuff they're like
hey here's here's a big slide in our
presentation that's all about how we
have a soldered Emily we're like we're
soldering yeah I just yeah rather than
using some crappy cheap thimble that
makes a complete new sub market for
deleting products yep like yeah that
market only exists because your product
sucks yeah so just some degree yeah no
that's totally true so competition is
good so yeah its competition is great
don't get us wrong but um who knows we
could be seeing an eight-core coffee
like CPU coming to replace the or
succeed the 8700 k as the new 8th gen
flagship potentially paired with a Z 390
chipset that which would really be
shitty because then you'd still have to
buy a 400 series chipset once ninth gen
comes around it's just until it's just
mmm they're scrambling I think this is
again I feel like it's so crazy this is
a good sword fight topic like yeah what
should Intel have done right what should
they have done all right so so Andy
blindsides maybe they're blindsided
whatever they've had five years to prep
point being AMD camp comes out last year
and kind of like actually presents them
with some competition they're like oh
crap we can either rush out our coffee
like stuff get it out early at least be
able to say we have this six core
processor the 8700 K and
and all that kind of stuff but it's
really rushed and it's not really
complete platform and all that kind of
stuff or should they have just like
conceded to AMD that segment of the
market for people who were looking for
stuff beyond with the 7,700 cake and
offer and waited and sell now or I feel
like maybe a month or two ago if if they
were devoting all of their resources to
a launch like they just did a week or
two ago
yeah like waited for that and and and
pushed it all out at once
yeah I'm just had no you know nosy 370
chipset at all or no zz3 90 chipset just
whatever that is one chipset right that
supports the six core and the eight core
yeah and all the modern features and
everything I don't know I guess it's a
it's hard to say it's a difficult
question as like we we critique them but
there's there's there's people in the
business ranks and Intel who have to
make these decisions right well they're
not gonna you know I have to imagine
that they're like like people aren't
gonna like this right like that we're
gonna get some pushback yeah but you
know they have to make a decision one
way or another so anyway that would've
been a good sort of a topic yeah but
it's not it's not part of its not so
what could have been all right but let's
move on because we were running short on
time here oh yeah yeah Rison Mobile has
apparently apparently been throttling
this is a youtuber from privilege that I
found on reddit tech epiphany heck
Epiphany he was noting on his laptop
here with a horizon 2200 G or 2200 you
risin three that trying to play for
tonight he was experiencing some some
really weak performance here his GPU
core clock speed was lower than expected
should be up to one point one gigahertz
but here it is at like 5 600 megahertz
if that and the CPU that he's using
isn't really fully utilized either which
means that the chip still has some
Headroom there power wise to drive the
GPU higher it's not like they're you
know the the power delivery is maxing
out on the GPU there's still a lot of
headroom here
he was trying to figure out why isn't my
GPU clocking up higher and he kind of
found this weird little quirk to the
system by unplugging the laptop at some
point he unplugged the laptop and by
unplugging the laptop it actually puts
it the system into a lower power state
okay and because of that it clocks down
the CPU to like from 2.2 gigahertz ish
to 1.6 and it instantly drives the GPU
up to like 800 megahertz okay
which yeah it's just tapped it right
there so it actually goes from anyways
like a 30 to 40 percent performance
uplift going from like 25 to 35 fps
which is still not super playable not
super comfortable it's definitely more
playable than 25 chop chop but the point
here is is that Rison the the Raven
Ridge mobile is throttling at the moment
or rise I shouldn't say Raven Ridge rate
rise in mobile is throttling and AMD has
not really kind of ironed this out yet
so what already is doing for this
overlay right here that mmm might be
speed has that I think it's I think it's
the FPS oh well maybe you're right
or perhaps frame times but it could be
frame time I'm wondering if that's part
of rivatuner rivatuner I haven't seen
that I haven't seen that yet anyway he
did see had a pretty decent suggestion
saying that you know it'd be cool if AMD
released like a rise in mobile horizon
mobile master master software that would
allow users to sort of set priority to
either the GP or the CPU based on
application specific needs but you know
this is just an ice this could be an
isolated incident this is one guy on
YouTube with a laptop doesn't mean that
if you're experiencing the same issue
with a different model of laptop that
his solution is gonna work for you but
it's something to be aware of and
definitely a something that we hope that
AMD picks up on and addresses because
that is a pretty huge performance
difference and obviously it's not ideal
to run a game on a laptop without AC
power because I
pretty quickly so I just want to point
that out so you're aware I have not had
the privilege of checking out rising
mobile yet personally neither have I but
that that's something that I want I want
to check out soon finally let's move on
to our last topic here which is about
Intel offloading virus scanning - its
GPUs to improve performance and battery
life this is from the verge Intel is
gonna let virus scanners use its
integrated graphics chipset to scan for
malicious attacks scanners typically use
the CPU which means since the resources
are getting eaten up left and right but
this method that Intel's now sort of
sort of pushing is gonna have a reduced
impact on performance and power
consumption especially you know if you
have a laptop or something like that
early testing from Intel shows CPU
utilization dropped from 20% during the
virus scan to as little as two percent
and Intel threat detection technology
will arrive on 6th 7th and 8th gen Intel
processors so a variety of devices will
be getting this type of support which is
very exciting
Intel's partnering with Microsoft
initially with a change coming to
Windows Defender advanced threat
protection they're also working with
other antivirus vendors to make this
beneficial change at a silicon level and
you know after the whole recent Spectre
Spectre debacle that Intel's been facing
they're trying to really beef up their
security but also make sure that their
security features do not compromise the
performance of their systems as a lot of
these Spectre related updates have done
in a lot of cases so Intel's now very
cautious about the whole situation CEO
Brian krzanich
cuz thank good maybe we should maybe we
should call our friend Curtis maybe we
should call our friend from ltte to
clarify brain crucifixes last name for
us they seem to be the same Department
really good at pronouncing it yes I'm
sure he is as we bring these new
products to market ensuring that they
deliver the performance improvements
people expect from us is critical so you
know
there's kind of a two-faced challenge
there security without compromising
performance is sort of a top priority
for Intel right now but those are all
the stories I have let's talk about some
donations donations all right bazinga
$20 thank you very much sorry about your
extended Friday the 13th yes that was a
very harrowing weekend and I appreciate
your your your your thoughts and prayers
going out to hotline and I indubitably
delta actual $5 hey guys I'm about to go
get dinner but I want to say hey and I
want all the info on Ares have a good
stream consider the info delivered yep
mission accomplished yeah NB 67 thirteen
dollars and 37 cents as always Kyle rip
hotline
don't say rip just yet because it might
not be ripped it might still be totally
fine I'm optimistic at this point thanks
Andy I'm looking forward to it
me too crazy gamer TV $20.00 I just got
back into your videos and then finally
wanting to get into PC building love all
your videos and I'm glad and getting
back into your channel I'm glad you're
getting back into my channel - thank you
crazy gamer TV I'm always happy to
inspire a fellow enthusiast bazinga x5
bow is what the fuck Kyle computer leak
flat tire and now no glasses that is the
ultimate catastrophe of this week they
say a fan contacts seven threes and Rios
and this was definitely the there it is
there it is there it is I'm sorry
address wire wrap 10 Canadian sup guys
Kyle rip hotline but on a positive note
I would like to share that I won a used
6600 K in an eBay auction only 70 bucks
whoo $90 with shipping and import fees
just have to wait and hope it works
that's actually a really good deal
yeah that's a sexy text little seats
that's like a 35 70 K goes for nowadays
I mean yes and you're still we're still
in the ballpark to get solid like used
z170 or z2 70 motherboards to go along
with it so nice pick up not too far out
of production geocache or $5 the British
pound zips recently while walking over
in town a pigeon flew straight at me I
punched it right in the face
just thought I'd shit with you guys Wow
Thank You geocachers you should wear a
GoPro all the time I know that we can
see that through your next time through
your depiction of that experience I felt
like I lived it with you yeah and I
punched that pigeon and I feel really
guilty for living it to know I'm
satisfied for me I'm just as a nice
crunch poor pigeon Thank You geocacher
thomas Byram $4.99 which is technically
one cent under the limit for actually us
reading your comment so we're not gonna
read your comment nope we've got Novus
77 386 with the $5
I need a mini ITX motherboard with Wi-Fi
for my rise in 1600 bill there's not
many options the gigabyte gets a
gigabyte one yeah really solid board yep
very good for overclocking if the board
they're sending out with Rison with
Vegas stuff and perfectly adequate for
their eyes into stuff as well so that's
a good board yeah you know but 77386 $5
tomorrow's my birthday should I
celebrate by putting my hard-earned cash
into a new rig thinking AMD this time or
the Lego UCS Millennium Falcon the rig
yeah the piece you gotta go for the
rig's gonna do so much more and it can
be pretty too like the the Millennium
Falcon yeah don't love it the Lego a
little bit like a millenium foam it's
really cool do the PC first and then
save up for the phone I would get I did
priorities you guys $20 I don't always
get better results when overclocking I
think it's a lack of voltage when a
higher clock CPU with inadequate voltage
performed worse than a lower clock CPU
with good voltage like a bad 5.0 versus
a good 4.9 with a higher clock CPU with
an adequate voltage so the voltage
should really matter
yeah the voltage might matter it matter
for the long-term life of the CPU if
you're overclocking and running it at a
higher voltage than it's actually built
for frequency is all that should matter
so a higher clock CPU at a lower voltage
as long as it's actually running
that clock speed and it's not throttling
or anything like that should perform
better than the lower clock CPU we have
more voltage right
and in my in my experience and I've done
this a few times trying to get a bit of
an overclock and a lower voltage than
stock is something I've done before
because that can mean that you run at
lower temperatures and your fans can
just like never have to bother spinning
it for anything so them yeah it's a nice
thing to do anyway pop shepherd
$10 yr ddr4 timing so hi my ddr3 g.skill
kit is 777 21 with XMP at 1333 I'm
building an x2 9 system for my video
editing parts are finalized what is your
experience with the 10 core I 970 900 X
I feel like if there's a one question
and then there's another question my
experience with that chip is very
limited in fact I've only streamed with
it once in the recent the last stream
that we did at my place yeah was it
seventy nine hundred X and that's like
the first I've really used it it's a
it's a very solid it's very good very
powerful processor and so I feel like
it's kind of overpriced compared to what
you can get for some of that from some
of the AMD platforms but if you have the
chip it's a really good processor it's
10 or an X 299 is a very solid platform
and when you're comparing ddr3 to ddr4
it's you can't exactly compare the
timings one to another you have to you
have to imagine that the timings are a
factor so a timing like a seven seven
seven whatever like that's that's that's
gonna be castle I can see and like
raster cast and a few other things in
there and that's how many clock cycles
seven clock cycles before it can do that
function right so you're talking about
timings of seven seven seven twenty one
with a with a speed of 1333 so that's 13
33 megahertz 1333 cycles per second so
that the timings execute at the
frequency right so when you go to ddr4
you're suddenly you're operating weight
operating at a higher frequency timings
being higher don't necessarily mean that
they're slower you have to do
math for each specific timing and
frequency in order to actually get like
the the actual throughput or bandwidth
or what I was breaking word is like
probably not remembering properly right
now but yeah it's it's it's confusing
going one to the other but just don't
just don't compare ddr3 to ddr4 or ddr3
don't one-to-one do it's not a
one-to-one interaction about timings for
sure thanks but NIC
five dollars and fifty five cents what
you recommend what would you recommend
as a good gaming desk I'm looking for
something L shaped and can support my
massive full tower case on top with two
27 inch monitors I went to Ikea and just
built two desks and made an L shape kind
of like Paul did and that works yeah
perfectly fine my desk set up here often
imitated never duplicated is basically
IKEA not desktops but countertops you
can buy countertops that I at IKEA in
preset sizes and I like these because
they're actually all solid wood it's not
like like you get the desktops and it's
like a bunch of cardboard inside with a
veneer on top yes is actually all wood
right or you can get cheaper ones it's
at least like a particle board inside
with the wood veneer on the outside too
which is which is also just fine yeah
but I find that like I like doing that
you buy it buy the tops buy the legs you
can get them separately and that way you
can buy them to the size you want them
to be yeah and then kind of build it out
yourself if you're interested on my
channel go to my channel and look at my
garage work logs
playlists and and I have when I when I
set these desks up and all that stuff
was good times I'm gonna get more
beautiful all right go for it
up north Ranger $5 Mini ITX build with
Verizon five 1600 X is the Strix be 350
worth it over a be 350 n purchase the
ladder but I'm thinking return I mean
RGB audio jacks am i right I don't know
if RGB audio jacks would be the the
reason why I would RMA something they're
very cool but let's see I don't know
the ab3 fits 8350 M that's the gigabyte
board I think right what
Paul and I were just saying great things
about that board in fact I just recently
did a Raven Ridge build in a super tiny
case doesn't even have like expansion
slots or anything for a discrete GPU and
I use that board and it's a great board
it's got Wi-Fi MDOT to nvme color scheme
is obviously black and red but it's not
gonna matter too much because there are
many many I TX cases that that have a
window for you to look at the colors
anyway um I don't know if the RGB audio
jacks with that important to you then do
it because it's a personal thing that's
objective but I personally would be very
happy with maybe 30 n okay have you done
no happy we are oh happy sup fellas five
dollars just here to show some love to
side a choose from I have a thanks know
that they appreciate a man thank you
thank you thank you you're my fav
automatic met five dollars hey guys only
a few weeks of training left then it's a
lot of studying to take my CER T test
for security and CCNA Sai CMD I'm gonna
pretend like I know what all this
acronyms are but it doesn't matter
because estimation I know that but I
just don't know what all those acronyms
stand for good luck bats I'm sure you
will automatically pass all of those
tests and you seem like a very smart guy
so I'm not too concerned for you but
it's very hard and I think good things
will come
good luck Justin perish $10 pre-ordered
an X 470 CH 7 and a 2700 X and just read
today there may be Z 490 AMD boards
coming shaking my head looking forward
to your videos Friday I haven't heard I
haven't caught wind of any Z for 90
boards but if that's the we'll be
discussing that on my half of the show
oh there we go
alright well we'll save that for for
Paul's half thank you very much Justin
alright sell you can cut off the
donations after heretic turncoat we will
cut it off there he'll be the last
donation firestar 26 $5 I messed up and
threw away the back
on my motherboard is there a way to get
a new one you'll have to ask the vendor
that you bought the motherboard from
yeah go extra for that they might not
sell it on their store but they could
just do you a solid and send you one
anyway if they're cool heretic turncoat
$10 are you still here is bid noria you
have a smaller bed that's your size
going on one she doesn't care she wants
the big one heroes too nice and and and
just was like whatever I'll just take
Nori's look at him he's like going don't
worry I got this one it's mine
and then Ori just like her back oh well
now that you're all nestled in I'm over
it now that you're nestled in I'm over
it that's very this is very typical
every day it's every day with these two
days of events here okay
and finally heretic turncoat $10 shop
and take my money our favorite comment
ever attached to a donation thank you
very much heretic and thank you all for
tuning into awesome Harborside hey don't
go anywhere because side B is coming
right around the corner on Paul's half
you can follow the link in my
description below if you're watching
this on youtube so you can take you
directly to pulse stream or you can just
stay where you are if you're watching on
twitch on TV slash saw some hardware
yeah apart from that I think you guys so
much also feel free to like and give us
give me some time stamps if you would
like to do the time stamps for my half
of the show because I'm very much
appreciated I love you so much in
advance also that's it that's totally it
so see you in a bit I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
