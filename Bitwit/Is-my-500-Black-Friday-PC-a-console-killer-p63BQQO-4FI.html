come over here check out this Tower of
Power
damn and the perfect pair to match oh
yeah go ahead and touch him if you like
I can barely fit my hands around the
room that's the laugh gate then he look
me straight in my eyes as he was feeling
him up said he'd never seen anything
like it I can't believe what I'm hearing
right now you guys are disgusting oh you
guys talking about the case fans oh
sorry
continue the new H 500 P from
coolermaster sports a pair of 200
millimeter RGB fans generous radiator
support and phenomenal cable management
packed in a unique industrial exterior
click the link of the description to
learn more what's up guys welcome back
to the channel hope you're all doing
well so you guys probably recall last
month when I walked into a Micro Center
retail store in Tustin California on
Black Friday morning with $500 cash in
my hand they actually used a credit card
doesn't matter anyway I set out to build
a PC or buy the parts required for a PC
within that budget and this is what I
came up with a sub $500 actually closer
to 400 and $70
Rison 3 based gaming PC and today we're
gonna be testing it out to see how it
does in a variety of games now $500 is a
pretty attractive price point for a
gaming PC because it's fairly comparable
to what you'd spend on a modern console
the only difference is that with a
gaming PC that you build yourself
there's no real set guarantee as to how
it's gonna perform in game whereas with
an Xbox for example if you buy an xbox
and your friend buys an Xbox
you can both rest assured that your
gaming experience is between more or
less identical with a gaming PC there's
a lot of questions and doubts and it can
be intimidating especially if it's your
first time building so today we're gonna
actually do some benchmarks on this guy
to see what kind of performance we can
get and whether or not it's worth
forking out sub $500 to build your own
system for gaming if you guys happen to
miss part one or even if he did watch it
since it was so long ago yeah sorry
that's my fault of course let's go ahead
and just do a quick refresher on the
specs
using in this system starting with our
CPU we have the AMD risin three 1200
which is a quad-core chip for the base
clock of 3.1 gigahertz it's a fantastic
value great bang for the buck and it
doesn't draw too much power or give off
much heat which is why the included
Wraith spire stock cooler that we have
from AMD is going to pull it down just
fine the chips currently seated in an
Asus Prime a 320 MK motherboard which
features the a320 chipset and that
chipset unfortunately does not support
CPU overclocking there was a bit of a
confusion at micro Center when I was
there I didn't realize that I could have
afforded a more expensive be 350
motherboard with my budget but because
of all the the Black Friday deals that
were going on they were sort of
conflicting with the sticker price and
so forth you can watch the part 1 video
for details but that is all to say we
cannot overclock our CPU which is quite
a bummer that being said you can
overclock memory on a 320 which is
exactly what I did with our 2 by 4 gig
kit of hyper X ddr4 2400 I was actually
able to take that within the UEFI 229 33
megahertz and that's gonna help us quite
a bit actually in gaming performance
with the rise in architecture or the Zen
architecture I should say and its
integration with Infinity fabric and so
forth so that was really exciting I'm
glad we at least got that down moving on
to our GPU we have the EVGA GeForce GTX
1050 t I this is not an overclocked
model I don't believe it comes factory
overclocked or anything like that
fortunately I was able to push that as
well we got a 140 mega Hertz offset on
the core clock and a 300 megahertz
offset on the memory clock that took us
up to nineteen hundred and two megahertz
on the memory clock under load and then
the core clock frequency was fluctuating
anywhere between 1750 and 1850 mega
Hertz was pretty constant within that
within that range because the
temperature didn't really change once we
got to around 60 61 degrees Celsius
which I guess I already gave away the
max temperature for a GPU it doesn't get
very hot big surprise the CPU while
we're at it only got up to 51 degrees
Celsius out of all the testing we did I
was probably testing for a good six
seven hours straight today didn't get
any harder than than than 51 then with
the old Wraith spire rounding off our
components here we've got a large assist
650 watt 80 plus
gold-certified power supply believe it
or not a one terabyte Toshiba hard drive
and a thermal take versa
h22 plus mid power case now for being a
dirt cheap case I'm actually kind of a
fan speaking of fans the chassis comes
with four case pans all right - at the
top one at the rear and the one at the
front - the blue LED move but still lots
of nice air flow coming through this
case despite the kind of cumbersome non
removable drive cage it's still pretty
cool in here all things considered which
also explains why our CPU and GPU are
able to stay as cool as they are
altogether we have a pretty solid system
if you guys are wondering what this SSD
is doing right here that's actually my
Steam library so I don't have to keep
loading games up onto every new system
so they were loading fast but it doesn't
really affect performance in any way so
speaking of performance though why don't
we talk about that all the games that I
tested were run at 1920 by 1080 using
the latest wiffle driver from Nvidia
that's version 3 88.7 one at the time of
filming and yeah that's pretty much all
one say other than that you guys know
the drill Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and all
that jazz so I'm gonna go ahead and kick
it off to some benchmarks I also did a
3d mark time spy and fire strike just
for the walls and we'll circle back and
talk about the results before closing
out this video sound good all right
three two one
well well well you little scamp you did
it you did a good job for four hundred
and seventy dollars I'm quite impressed
with this little rig I mean six out of
the seven games we tested mind you most
of these games are triple-a titles guys
were able to hit 60fps on average the
only one that didn't that fell a little
short was battlefield one I believe that
hit 52 FPS on average but still really
not too bad and beyond that all of our
games saw one percent lows of at least
30 FPS and for those of you who don't
know one percent lows basically
indicates the slowest one percent of
performance on average so that's that is
to say that this guy's head was floating
above that 30 FPS threshold of vast
majority of the time that equates to
very little to no perceived choppiness
even in very stressful scenarios or
scenes that I was testing so that's all
really great news to top it all off
there was only one game that we could
not run at very high or ultra settings
and that was pub key which as we all
know is a very poorly optimized game and
it's not even a finished game by any
means so that's a really good testament
for this little PC here for under $500
you're getting your foot in the door to
PC gaming and in my opinion it's it's it
beats out of console hands-down and
there's a couple other reasons why not
only are you getting a better gaming
experience but you have an upgrade path
so instead of having to buy the new Xbox
one xxxx when that comes out because you
want all the new features there you can
simply just swap out the CPU as you see
fit or your graphics card upgrade your
memory etc and since you'll have already
built your PC from the ground up you
won't have any problem swapping those
components out later down the line to
top it all off there is simply so much
more you can do with the PC than you can
your average console this is not just a
gaming machine and and granted consoles
can do things like web browsing and
streaming Netflix but I feel like even
those experiences are far superior in a
desktop environment when you get things
like a keyboard and mouse interface and
high refresh rate displays and so forth
not to mention the endless list of other
things you can do on a PC like
installing emulators and expanding your
game library even further or creating a
server and
looking up your photos and videos and
other precious files and documents or
email productivity word processing
content creation Photoshop video editing
and so forth there's so much out there
guys that you can do with this thing
that you just can't do with an Xbox and
so if you have five hundred dollars in
your hand and you're at a fork in the
road console gaming PC you know where I
stand and I know a lot of you guys who
watch me regularly are already aware of
all this I'm preaching to the choir here
so this is really targeted to those who
may be intimidated or have never built a
gaming PC on their own before and might
be sitting on the fence not sure which
way to go so if that's you I hope that
this video it has in some small way
nudged you in the right direction
because it really is a great experience
so if you guys happen to enjoy this
video I'm sure to toss me a like on it
that helps me tremendously and also feel
free to subscribe to the channel for
more tech stuff coming at you really
