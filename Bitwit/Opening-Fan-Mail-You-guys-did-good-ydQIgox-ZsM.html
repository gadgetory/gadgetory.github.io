channel today I'm doing something a
little different this is actually my
first dedicated fan mail unboxing video
now I've done this before
with Paul on awesome hardware where we
open up some stuff that you guys have
sent to our Pio boxes I've addressed
mine in the description below in case
you want to send me something but I've
never done an actual dedicated video
towards it for it and I've got four
packages today two boxes and two
envelopes that we're going to be opening
on camera this is I've never opened any
of these before all the reactions you're
about to see are my genuine first time
reactions to seeing any of this any of
the stuff I have no idea what it is I
have an idea what this big one might be
because it's from BevMo
I'll be very disappointed if it's not
something I could drink and if you guys
end up sending me more stuff in the
future then maybe we can do more of
these unboxings you know assuming that
it's enjoyable for y'all and things like
that
disclaimer quick disclaimer you are free
to send me anything at any time to my P
o box and yes that is an open invitation
to to even ship me things like lots of
money boxes of money are always
appreciated however do not send me like
ten kilos of cocaine that'll stress me
out okay if there's like a finger in
there along with it and this is like a
note not to mention I'm gonna figure out
how to snort all that to myself that's
just nothin eats that burden let's just
go ahead and start opening up stuff here
let's go with the letters let's go with
one letter first this one's from Justin
Justin L from Diamond Bar California hey
you're a local so we got my handy box
cutter here just gonna go for it what we
got here oh it's the letter deer bit
wood hello I see that you're almost at
600,000 subscribers Congrats
I'm just 13 years old and I know 13 year
old sound like that but I'm going to
keep going anyway and I just got into
building pcs right now and I'm saving
money to build a gaming PC if it wasn't
for your building a PC Guide I would
have wasted a lot of money I'm hoping
you do a full video of how to build a PC
in every little detail - so myself and
others can learn as well I'm not looking
at budget pcs though I'm looking at pcs
that can run overwatch GTA 5 watchdogs -
and a bunch of other games as well with
good FPS quality and no lag please write
back or make a video of my question
thanks
why thank you very much Justin for the
gracious letter and you know what I've
actually got a how to build a PC video
in the works
I've already started scripting it so
funny you should mention that I don't
know exactly when that's going to be
done could be a week could be a month
but stay tuned and I'm glad you're
enjoying the content good luck on your
first PC when you finally decide to dive
in let's go ahead and move on to our
next package which is room this is from
Erin Wiggins mr. Wiggins ah Waze mods
Wallace look didn't I meet I met Erin at
the fan me that the pollen I did back in
November of last year
Erin was a really cool guy I believe he
has a custom sleeving web site that I
will put up so I can find it somewhere
on the screen you can check that out
this is very interesting and this
package sort of concerns me because it
has hearts on it there's little hearts
on the tape and it says find what you
love and the oh and love is a heart
I don't like packages like that
especially when they're from dudes that
aren't my wife that is like I was
inferring that my wife was a dude she's
not but you never know what's going to
be in these types of boxes oh yes whoo
these are nice because this is really
nice quality here and it's kind of dark
royal blue type color and then this
one's very nice to you it's like a snake
skins like a rattlesnake I'm sure
there's a name for this pattern but this
is really really nice quality no
heat-shrink I like that there's no heat
shrink the bend is the arc is absolutely
beautiful beautiful go ahead and check
out waz mob guys I might hit him up for
a future build who knows
is there more stuff in here good lord I
should probably read this I'm the
asshole who like looks at the president
before he reads the letter or the card
I'm I'm a dick I'm sorry erred here we
go handmade custom cables but a bit of
little bit of an abscess for Paul and me
he gets to choose one of these I'll make
sure that it's fair your pollen Kyle I

holiday season and even better new year

other is PE t leaving excellent thank

beautiful family Aaron and thank you
again so much to you and your wife for
sending all this awesome stuff really
appreciate it let's go ahead and move on
to the next one let's do this letter
from Amy oh god I'm really bad at
opening these letters just because I'm
using a box cutter open an envelope it's
from a girl hello my name is Amy H and
I'm contacting you because my husband
Bob is a huge fan of yours
he signs up for all your contests and is
always in awe when it comes to your
projects my husband
thanks for rubbing it in Amy is and has
always been very tech savvy I'm sure he
is I'm sure he knows his way around the
hardware since he was young technology
and gaming became his escape so much so
that he got a tattoo of a young boy
playing video games on his chest to this
day he loves gaming but his love for
technology has only grown over the years
he hopes to pursue a Bachelor degree in
computer science once I graduate in May
my husband is such a selfless man oh
come on
look I stood a chance anyway my
husband's birthday is this month I would
really love to do something incredible
for the man who's been helping me
achieve my dream and I was wondering if
you could help me complete his desktop
for him please if there is anything you
can do to help me with this I would
greatly appreciate it thank you for your
time
sincerely Inc well Amy that's a very
touching letter and honestly it's a very
admirable what your husband has done and
sacrificed for you and your family as
far as helping him build his desktop I
cannot give you guys any parts that's
not something I do with fans typically
just because there are a lot of people
who try to abuse that not saying that
you guys are full like wholeheartedly
believe this is a genuine email a
genuine letter but there are so many
people
to try to take advantage of my kind
heart and soul that I just had this
policy going for several years now that
I do not give Hardware away and left via
a giveaway or something like that
however if you wanted if you were open
to the idea of me assembling the rig for
your husband once you get all the parts
hit me up and if you want to send them
over here then I would be more than
happy to actually assemble your
husband's rig for you and ship it back
to you guys in in your city of residence
that would be fun I can make a video on
it and I'm sure the audience would get a
kick out of that as well
so hit me up if that's what you're into
but thank you very much for the letter
Amy I do appreciate it
sex you're married though whatever and
that leaves our Big Kahuna here our big
