few weeks back I built my dad a new
computer to replace his six year old HP
Pavilion desktop and while you all had
lovely things to say about his shiny new
PC many of you were equally interested
in checking out the dusty machine he'd
been using well I have finally procured
the ancient relic so I can give you all
a nice little trip down memory lane as
we conduct a full tour additionally I
thought this would be a great
opportunity to discuss which parts of an
old pre-built system are still useable
when building out your new one as not
every component in a computer gets
outdated at the same rate and knowing
which parts to carry over can net you
some healthy savings on your new custom
rig before we dive in it's also
important to bear in mind that the
condition of your old desktop and the
level of performance you wish to gain
from your new one will heavily factor
into the reusability of your old
hardware so here's our first look at my
dad's a 6700 Y HP Pavillion this pre
built desktop made its debut back in
2009 and while the hardware's
performance was adequate for the first
few years of ownership coming preloaded
with Windows Vista ensured enough pain
and suffering from day one the micro ATX
case features a thin steel frame and a
plastic front panel sporting a multi SD
card reader - five and a quarter inch
bays an external three and a half inch
Bay audio jacks USB 2 and firewire at
the rear we see support for a full ATX
power supply for expansion slots and the
cases only fan a 90 millimeter exhaust
at the very least you do get some
ventilation cutouts on both side panels
lastly inside the case you'll find a
drive cage for two three and a half inch
drives though it might not be the first
thing you'd consider repurposing your
old case isn't entirely out of the
question as long as it features
removable side panels for internal
hardware access and support standard
size motherboards such as micro ATX now
that being said there are probably more
reasons to leave your case behind a
newer chassis could give you some
updated features like USB 3.0 more
Hardware expansion and better air flow
to keep your system cooler and working
properly in the end while it is possible
to salvage your old case you're probably
better off starting fresh with this
particular component
for our CPU we have an AMD phenom x4
9150 II a quad-core chip at 1.8
gigahertz using the AM 2 + socket we
also have 4 gigs of ddr2 memory and an
ECS motherboard with the GeForce 6150 en
force 430 chipset from Nvidia which
serves as our onboard graphics in most
cases if you're aging prebuilt is slower
than tree sap the culprits are often
these three components your CPU RAM and
motherboard the same goes for the
dedicated graphics card should your
system have one it would be great if you
could just upgrade one of these four
components and magically cure your old
rig of Grandma tis 'm but unfortunately
that's just not how computers work at
the same time there is a chance you
could repurpose these parts for a low
power system like a Home Server or home
theater PC for example just don't plan
on populating your new PC with these
components if you're looking for a true
upgrade atop our Phenom processor is a
CPU cooler from Coolermaster which uses
an aluminum heatsink in tandem with an
80 millimeter fan unlike the aging chip
that it serves the CPU cooler maintains
much of its longevity over time making
it a strong candidate for reuse in most
cases an AM 2 plus cooler such as this
one will fit a wide range of other AMD
sockets as AMD has managed to retain the
design of their mounting bracket system
over the years pre-built systems using
Intel chips with Intel CPU coolers on
the other hand are a different story as
the company typically changes out their
mounting design with the release of
newer sockets if your AMD or Intel CPU
cooler does happen to be compatible with
your new computer's hardware you'll also
want to make sure that it has enough
cooling capacity to sufficiently cool
your new CPU there's a fair chance that
your new processor will use more power
and produce more heat than your old one
so be sure that the TDP rating of your
CPU cooler is higher than the operating
TDP of your new CPU now as for you
enthusiasts out there who plan on
overclocking your CPUs this probably
goes without saying but chances are the
cooler in that old rig just isn't going
to cut it so plan on picking up a new
one that doesn't blow in the
metaphorical sense of course I mean
literally speaking they should
now that we're on the unforeseen topic
of blowing now would be a good time to
discuss case fans with a proper dusting
the fans in your old case can run good
as new as long as your new chassis
supports the appropriate fan size it
should be noted however that higher-end
cases these days are less likely to
support fans smaller than 120
millimeters at the front of the case our
pavilion packs a single 500 gig Samsung
harddrive at 7200 rpm system builders
will be happy to hear that the hard
drive is probably the most reusable
component for a new PC the technology
and hard drives hasn't changed much over
the years though we're seeing drives
with bigger capacities now more than
ever before
still you can get a lot of mileage out
of 500 gigs even by today's standards
and users with more demanding storage
needs can still use this as a secondary
drive in their system or repurpose it
into an external drive like hard drives
optical drives haven't evolved much in
recent years either and some would argue
that the outdated technology has already
gone the way of the dinosaur be that as
it may some folks still like having the
option built-in when they need it and
lucky for them this is one of the
easiest parts to welcome into a new PC
and lastly we have this 300 watt power
supply from best tech that sits silently
perched above the unsuspecting
components waiting for the day when it
swiftly vanquishes them with an
explosive pit of fire like some
bloodthirsty pyro but yes my
confrontation with pre volt power
supplies is often met with suspicion and
distrust in case you missed it well I
have to hand it to this unit for not
racking up a list of burn victims in its
6 years of service most pre-built
desktops are known to ship with cheap e
power supplies that meet the bare
minimum requirements for their product
warranties apart from the issue of
reliability and safety it's also
unlikely that your old power supply will
have all the appropriate connectors and
the necessary wattage to drive your new
system in the end when it's time to
ditch your old computer it's probably
best that the sketchy power supply
inside be buried with it and I think
that pretty much wraps it up ladies and
gentleman
so hopefully you enjoyed this little
tour of my dad's old rig and hopefully
those of you coming from a prebuilt PC
and looking to build your next one are
now better equipped to take on the
challenge before you go don't forget to
