to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info so I got
to stop by the be quiet sweet and they
only had one or I guess two really new
things that they were showing off but
exciting nonetheless something that I've
actually been waiting for them to do for
a very long time and that is taking
their existing coolers which are great
performers and look beautiful and
essentially swapping out the mounting
mechanism to something way less terrible
and that's exactly what they've done
with their dark rock 4 and dark Rock Pro
for these things are absolutely
beautiful more on the actual klore
themselves but the mounting solution is
super simple now the bracket there's a
bracket to long bracket that goes over
your copper baseplate there's two screws
on either end and you basically have to
remove two caps you just unscrew two of
the little caps on top of the heatsink
cover and then they've included a really
long screwdriver because some folks just
aren't long enough
and you basically put the screwdriver
down the down the hole down a little
tunnel and screw down that bracket and
that's it it's super simple no longer do
we have to like tighten their coolers
down with the little nuts and bolts or
whatever a little nuts you know some
small nuts as so much innuendo in this
video already and then just like tighten
them in with your finger and it's like
really hard to do or they give you a
shitty little wrench that thing's sucked
I'm going off on a tangent right now but
I'm really happy that they've moved away
from the old model with this new one
it's here to stay I asked him was like
you're gonna do this for like every
cooler from now on right you're not
going back for all the other future
models like no no we're done we're done
we totally we get it that's pretty much
the biggest complaint that people were
bitching about with the dark rock or
with all the be quiet coolers as the
mounting mechanism it was just awful so
now that that's fixed yay everything's
perfect this is actually gonna be a
pretty nice competitor to knock to I
think the dark dark rock Pro 4 is around
90 bucks and obviously naktu has got
some really high-end coolers for around
that price range but hey look out not
only doesn't do they perform well and
look good but they're also easy to
install now so that's a really nice
refreshing change there's also been some
redesigns to the cooler itself for
example they're using a ceramic coating
on the aluminum fin stack now which is
just basically to help aid in
transfer plain and simple normal paints
would practically insulate the heat so
it's good they've gone ceramic for this
we've also got sort of a new cosmetic
just slightly it's blacker it's blacker
than black now though the heatsink cover
is actually dark and not sort of a
gunmetal gray so it's a bit more a bit
more matchy-matchy I guess with all the
other black that we see on cases for
example the coolers also maintain their
compatibility with both Intel and AMD
sockets and taking a closer look at the
pro model we've got a copper base plate
with seven copper heat pipes or copper
line keep pipes I should say a large
aluminum fence stack with two silent
wings two fans which are SuperDuper
quiet and perform fantastically no pun
intended there's a 120 millimeter on the
front and a 135 millimeter right in
between two of those thin towers 250
watt TDP so this thing can handle quite
a bit the non pro model also has the
same sort of copper base plate but only
six heat pipes and a single 135
millimeter fan with a 200 watt TDP still
very robust this is coming to us in
April for the same price mind you as
their existing sad mount counterparts so
that's all good stuff guys let me know
what you think in the comments below
that's all I got for the be quiet suite
that's all they really had to be honest
and but exciting changes nonetheless so
let me know what y'all thank cos like do
all that stuff subscribe obviously more
CES coverage on the way you know at some
point I'm gonna say more CES coverage on
the way but it'll be my last CES video
so technically I'll be lying you unless
we're talking about next year which I
guess I won't be lying alright I don't
know what I'm talking about this anyway
thanks for watching guys have a good one
and I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
