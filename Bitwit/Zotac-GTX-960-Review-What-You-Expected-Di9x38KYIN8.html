doing my first proper review of the GTX
960 and the one I have here with me
today happens to be from my friends at
ZOTAC now ZOTAC has two different
flavors of GTX 960 this one here being
the more modest option with a slight
factory overclock which you can find for
$1.99 and for 10 bucks more you can get
their amp Edition on which they push the
core clock even further added a beefed
up cooler and a pretty nice looking
backplate pauls hardware does a great
review of the amp Edition so in case you
haven't already seen it I'll put a link
in the description
here's a quick side-by-side comparison
between the two cards and please forgive
that I'm using the Newegg website I was
going to have this one kid I know make a
custom slide for me but he died in a
depressing nationwide commercial now
we'll go to into detail here because I'm
sure by now the GTX 960 specs have all
been etched into your minds but I did
want to quickly remind that the GTX 960
does come with the whole family of
Nvidia technologies like dynamic super
resolution and gsync and shield support
the card also supports up to 4 monitors
with a smart offering of video outputs
including three DisplayPort 1.2 s1 HDMI
2.0 and dual link DVI
the cooler itself uses a gray metallic
construction for its semi-open shroud
and has some stylish plated accents with
very tasteful vendor branding on the
front akin to other gtx 960 s available
the fans on this card remain idle until
the GPU reaches a certain load and even
during wider scenes while I was gaming
the fans held their bear when they
eventually did spin up during a
firefight
I really couldn't hear them at all
through my define R 5 despite having
removed some of the sound dampening
panels up top all things considered it's
no surprise that ZOTAC sound testing for
this card was conducted with a long year
jerboa the GPU idles nicely at 38
degrees Celsius which is impressive
considering that's achieved with zero
rpm passive cooling with the fans active
temps didn't go above 71 degrees Celsius
when gaming which is really nice to see
now apart from minimal heat output the
card single 6-pin pci ii connector and
120 watt TDP makes it a great low impact
option for something like an HTTP C I
know that personally when I was planning
out my home theater PC I wanted to make
it as small as possible and that meant
using an SFX power supply that didn't
quite have enough watts to drive a very
demanding card so I would think
considering what's available today the
960 might be a good solution for those
of you looking for a similar setup it
also helps that the cards only 8 inches
long which makes it friendly to many
small form-factor cases as for the rest
of the cooler you do get a slim heat
sink permeating by 2 6 millimeter copper
heat pipes yeah it seems pretty basic
but based on the temps I was getting
this configuration works beautifully as
an aesthetic choice though I would have
liked to see nickel-plated heat pipes to
cover up the copper color it's just that
it kind of looks how do I put this
politely ugly you do get a nice black
PCB however with an sli finger for up to
2 Way SLI and if you want to see some
SLI benchmarks of the GTX 960 as well as
the single GP results for this card I've
already posted them in my 960 SLI versus
970 video so you can check the
performance out there what you'll find
there is that the GTX 960 is undeniably
tailored for 1080 gaming the 128 bit
memory interface as well as the other
memory specs confirm this and while the
960 has fallen short of our expectations
in some ways it does seem to check all
the boxes for 1080 gamers in need of a
power efficient card at the most
affordable price point as forz√≥ techs
take on the GTX 960 I honestly think
it's one of the more sensible designs
for the car that I've seen a lot of
other 960s have bat longer coolers on
them but I don't really think that's
necessary for such a low power card that
probably shines best in something like
nht PC or even a small steam box there's
also been a lot of talk that these specs
and performance of the GTX 960 feels
more akin to a 950 Ti so when I see a
10-inch 960 sporting a big aggressive
cooler it feels like it's trying to be
something it's not and I definitely
don't get that impression with this card
from ZOTAC achievement unlocked for
self-awareness not to mention a fancier
cooler generally warrants a few extra
bucks from your wallet but I don't know
what do you guys think is the gtx 960
what you expected and what kind of
system could you see yourself using it
