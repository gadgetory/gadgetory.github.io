awesomesauce news today I'll be
comparing the direct see you mini GTX
670 to a Seuss's direct Cu 2 GTX 670 I
figured I might as well do this
comparison video because well I
personally use a direct Cu 2 GTX 670 at
home so I had access to that and I also
had access to the direct CU mini I could
actually borrowing it from Newegg at the
time but today I'm just gonna be
comparing and contrasting the two
separate cards because they're very
similar but yet have some significant
differences as well the specifications
are pretty much exactly the same same
number of CUDA cores same memory
interface both 256 bits PCIe gen3 so
forth however the directs to you Mini
does come factory overclocked right out
of the box so I will be manually
overclocking the direct cu2 GTX 670 to
make it fair so hopefully we'll see some
similar performance results I didn't
spend too much time trying to find the
perfect overclock settings I would
consider both these cards to have the
exact same performance for example if I
was testing out a direct Cu to top card
I would expect it to be about the same
as the direct Cu mini overclocked so
that said what I what I will be
comparing today is the size of the cards
the temperature and power consumption of
each as well as the acoustics and lastly
I will be testing out the performance
even though yes they're more or less
expected to be exactly the same I still
was gonna show you guys a few games that
I ran these cards with and just give you
some frame rates because hey the Olaf
inch marks right so with that said why
don't we get on to our first comparison
tests with size so if you're looking at
these two cards side-by-side right off
the bat obviously the direct Cu Mini is
significantly shorter than the direct
cu2 by about 4 inches actually so this
direct Cu mini measures six point seven
inches long whereas the directs you to
is ten point seven inches long that's
said you could easily still put the
direct cu mini inside of a full tower or
a mid tower computer case might just
look a little bit funny but you can
still do SLI so stack two or three of
these bad boys up in a in a you know mid
tower computer case and it might look
pretty badass but essentially the
directs you mini is geared towards
smaller form factor builds
you know more significantly ITX builds
mini ITX systems would greatly benefit
from a small card like this that's still
going to be driving a lot of power for a
lot of gaming potential and performance
so essentially the size is just an added
benefit because a lot of mini ITX
chassis is out there can now accommodate
full-length graphics cards you know
cards up to 10 inches and beyond but
still I think there's still a benefit of
having a smaller card even if your
chassis can accommodate a larger one
just because the larger your card is the
more space it's taking up inside of your
case and that essentially limits the
amount of airflow going through so even
though it might be a minimal difference
I still see it as a benefit to have a
smaller card like this one especially in
a mini ITX form factor essentially if
you look at the height of the cards it
doesn't really matter as much when
you're talking about GPUs what the
height of it is not nearly as much as
the length anyway but still I guess it's
something to take into consideration the
PCB of the direct cu mini is actually
higher it's actually taller than the
direct see you to I guess that's how
they made it so short is that they had
to expand on that axis just a tad so
it's about half an inch taller than the
direct see you to but if you look here
the the copper pipes coming out of the
direct see you to actually make it a
taller card overall so might look at
first like the direct cu mini is taller
but what but in fact the direct see you
to model is a little bit higher now to
measure the acoustics of each of these
cards I used my Samson go mic and I
actually took the side panel off of my
chassis but I did test both idle and
load configurations and the audio levels
for each those for both cards so why
don't you take a listen and see for
yourself which is the quieter card of
the 2
all right so clearly the winner in this
round goes to the direct cu2 was
significantly quieter under full load
than the direct see you mini which is
pretty expected though right because the
direct co mini only has one fan on it so
it's got to do the same job with half
the manpower because direct cu2 clearly
has two fans don't have to spin up as
much don't have to work as hard as the
direct see you mini so I kind of feel
bad for him but he did a good job still
nonetheless with the side panel on which
I didn't show you guys but I listened
for myself it was noticeable when the
fans ramped up or the fan ramped up on
the direct co mini but it wasn't too
much to the point where it took me out
of the game or was obnoxious or really
even noticeable after a few seconds of
hearing it alright so moving on to
thermals the direct see you two
basically beat out the direct see you
mini in pretty much every test and game
that I ran which is completely expected
by the way because with the direct see
you two you've got a much beefier cooler
you've got two fans cooling the whole
thing you've got a much wider expansive
thinner rate going on as opposed to the
direct see you mini which is this tiny
little six seven inch card that is four
inches shorter than the directs you to
it's only got one fan on it it's got a
significantly smaller heat sink as beefy
as it is for the card size so it's
pretty much no surprise here that the
direct co2 got much better thermals than
the direct see you mini but just to
recap here I've got BioShock Infinite 74
degrees Celsius with the direct see you
to 81 degrees with a direct see you many
crashes 365 degrees with the direct see
you to 81 degrees with the direct see
you mini Blood Dragon Far Cry 3 Blood
Dragon awesome game got 68 degrees with
the direct see you to and the mini
pumped out 82 degrees Celsius and lastly
3dmark fire strike extreme 76 degrees
with the directs to u2 and 81 degrees
with the direct to see you mini so
overall not terrible temperatures
actually the rec see you mini actually
has some pretty decent thermals to it
they're not great but they're not
horrible either there's nothing I would
be alarmed of they just kind of pale and
complete in comparison to the thermals
that the direct cu2 was able to achieve
but like I said before that is one of
the sacrifices that you
make when having a significantly smaller
form factor piece of hardware like a GPU
like this dreck co mini I mean you're
cutting off 4 inches of the cooler so
with that said why don't we talk a
little bit about power consumption not
much to talk about actually pretty much
the same all across the board
I was seeing wattage a power draw of
about 160 to 170 watts of course this is
gonna vary with the direct cu2 that I
have because obviously I'm manually
overclocked it so depending on how you
would overclock that card of course
that's gonna change its gonna fluctuate
a bit but essentially these two cards
draw about the same amount of power and
even for example the direct Cu Mini has
a single eight pin PCIe power connector
whereas the directs you to card has two
6-pin PCI II power connectors so right
off the bat that kind of tips you off to
believe that these two cards do draw
about the same amount of wattage and
that brings us to our final round for
this comparison which is performance now
I basically tested these two cards out
across three different games and one
synthetic benchmark and as I might have
mentioned before the results between
these two cards are very similar they
have the exact same specifications other
than the fact that the direct Cu Mini
comes factory overclocked and I had to
manually overclock the direct Cu 2 card
I think I had a hundred and ten percent
power target 50% I'm sorry fifty
megahertz core clock increase and a
fifteen megahertz memory clock increase
for that rx see you too
those are my overclock settings
depending on what you use or what you
may see they're probably gonna vary so
the results that I'm giving you here
will vary
I believe that well I'm not gonna say
too much I'm just gonna let you guys
watch some gameplay
see some numbers sit back and relax and
yeah here you go here are your
benchmarks
alright guys so there are the results
and quickly I did want to mention that
the direct cu2 did get beeped out by the
direct Cu mini in both Crysis 3 and Far
Cry 3 Blood Dragon by a significant
amount by about 4 frames but that's also
because I kind of held back on the
overclock settings for the Rex to you -
I didn't really do an extreme overclock
I kind of went for more of a moderate
configuration just because I feel it's
more representative of the
out-of-the-box overclock that you
commonly see with most factory overclock
cards usually they don't push the
boundaries of that card when they
factory overclock yet they just kind of
give it a little bit of a boost which is
essentially what I did but the direct
see you - but off the record I did
actually do an extreme overclock for the
direct see you - and I was able to beat
out the direct Cu mini in pretty much
every test I ran so just want to point
that out but that said let's wrap it up
so if you're gonna go for a smaller form
factor build maybe you're looking for a
mini ITX system I would definitely go
with the direct Cu mini even if the
direct cu2 card can fit inside of your
smaller form factor chassis I still
prefer the mini just because it takes up
less space which means more airflow and
essentially just looks pretty badass
inside of a little rig however if you're
going with a mid Tower or full Tower
chassis I would essentially go with the
direct Cu to every time just because
it's it's got a larger cooler thermals
are better and quite frankly it just
looks a bit more substantial in a larger
case the Rex EU mini might look a little
strange or out of place inside of a
larger form factor build but with that
said they're both extremely good cards
and I know I know guys 700 series is
right around the corner why are you
talking about 600 series cow I know but
you know still the de beque co mini is a
new card it just came out and the 600
series is still a really good that it
still kicks ass you know I mean like
even when the 700 series comes out I'm
probably not gonna upgrade right right
away because the 670 for my needs is is
just perfect right now and I have no
complaints whatsoever and essentially
I'm sure some of you might even be
looking into getting a 600 series card
even when the 700 series cards hit the
stores just because you might see a
price drop not sure about that but it's
always a potential possibility but on
that note
that is gonna conclude this video for
