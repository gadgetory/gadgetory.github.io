hear the news mainstream virtual reality
is finally a reality
I should probably cut that out as we've
seen across the interwebs early adopters
everywhere have already begun receiving
the first retail units of the oculus
rift with the HTC vive hot on its heels
so I thought it would be fun to build a
VR ready PC to celebrate what's arguably
the biggest launch in gaming history
since flappy bird now of course the term
VR Eddie PC is very broad since any
system that meets or exceeds the
recommended specs for VR essentially
falls into that category well the
objective of today's build aims to
surpass those suggested requirements in
almost every area to give us some
additional performance and an overall
smoother VR experience for the next few
years
behold the highly recommended VR ready
PC which will set you back just north of
1900 buckaroos now don't have a panic
attack you can easily spend about half
this amount and still build a VR capable
machine today's system just packs in
some extra horsepower to ensure our
heads aren't barely above water as for
testing I actually did manage to
preorder the oculus rift while attending
CES back in January and I would have
made the first wave of shipments had I
not woken up naked on Las Vegas
Boulevard the morning after an unnamed
industry party so as fate should have it
we'll have to sit tight for now before
stressing this rig in a VR environment
in the meantime let me know in the
comments if you want to see some non VR
benchmarks and I'll get right on it
on that note that's enough rambling for
me I think VR prices have already fallen
so without further ado let's dive into
the hardware will be using for today's
build for our CPU I've chosen the Intel
Core i5 6600 K oculus and HTC recommend
a core i5 4590 or better so I've gone
the better route with a faster and
unlocked skylake chip since our workload
is mostly reliant on the GPU I refrain
from spending more on a 6700 K perhaps
I'll do a comparison later to see what
difference in I seven and
hyper-threading makes with VR and
DirectX 12 to take advantage of the CPUs
overclocking capabilities I decided on
the EVGA z170 for the win the all-black
profile is stealthier than a fart at
comic-con it also sports a highly
efficient vrm with five phase PWM
storage options including nvme PCIe and
plenty of USB ports for sweet VR headset
love-making additional features like
surface mounted power CMOS and an
onboard cpu type monitor make this a
motherboard I
to fondle for memory we have a 16 gig
dual channel kit of corsair dominator
platinum ddr4 at 3,000 megahertz to be
safe we're doubling the recommended
capacity for additional Headroom and why
not given the increasing affordability
of ddr4 that's right I'm calling cheap
the Platinum Series is known for their
entrusted reliability and performance
but Who am I kidding I just want
something sexy to look at when I take my
VR headset off the heat spreaders
they're so beautiful to handle the bulk
of our workload I wanted a GPU that
would not only tear through the current
lineup of VR games but be able to handle
the next wave of titles as well so here
we have the gigabyte GTX 980 Xtreme you
know they're serious when they spell
extreme with an X the card stays super
cool when overclocked thanks to the wind
force cooler which also features
software controlled RGB illumination on
both the wind force emblem and the
triple fan assembly I've gotten so used
to seeing RGB lights on everything now
that my cats are no longer cute they're
just dull and uncustomed
calling our 6600 K is the H 100 iv2 from
Corsair I've been using H series aao
coolers in my personal desktop since
2011 and unlike a homeless guy named
Chuck they've never taken a leak on me
so I'm looking forward to dialing in
some cool overclocks with their latest
240 millimeter model while the cooler
already looks pretty badass I will be
swapping out the stock radiator fans for
these sp1 20s hopefully Corsair won't be
mad that I ditched them for themselves
for storage I chose to stay away from
mechanical drives all together to
improve acoustics and reduce loading
times after all by the time I'm done
waiting for the oculus rift to arrive I
won't have any patience left for my
games to load if you're in the market
for a similar setup the crucial MX 200
is a great bang for the buck option that
delivers outstanding performance
consistency and reliability for as low
as 29 cents a gig here we have 250 for
our boot drive and a one terabyte model
reserved for our video games powering
the system is EVGA sgq 650 watt power
supply the unit sports a semi modular
design with a quiet 130 millimeter fan
but you know what's even quieter than
that no fan at the back of the power
supply is an eco switch that enables
fanless mode for zero rpm silent
operation the unit includes flat black
cables for easy and attractive cable
management while carrying an 80 plus
certification for gold rated efficiency
now one of the components I'm most
excited to work with today is the
corsair 600 C the latest addition to the
carbide series
a latch side panel window for creepin on
your hardware with an inverted internal
layout that flips the components upside
down benefits of this orientation
include direct airflow greater
visibility of the graphics card and
scaring your friends into thinking
you've done something horribly wrong the
case delivers a substantial amount of
airflow out of the box but I couldn't
help but toss in some a of series fans
for a more custom appearance winding
down with some bling accessories we have
an RGB LED kit and additional strip from
cable mod to complement the lighting on
our gtx 980 they've also been so kind as
to supply a pack of their white sleeved
extensions which granted do nothing for
our frame rates but look very nice and
those are all the things for the thing
we're about to build and you can find
links to everything in the description
below at the time of making this video
the total cost of all these parts with
Amazon pricing comes out to nineteen
hundred and ten dollars it's not exactly
an impulse buy and your wallet will
likely be offended and start a Facebook
group but hopefully what we have here is
a PC that will provide one of the most
immersive and fluid VR experiences for
the next few years
on that note ladies and gentlemen let's
build a computer
just like that our pile of hardware has
transformed into a fully operational VR
sex panther for the most part this was a
pretty straightforward built assembly in
the 600 C was a piece of cake with tons
of space for cable management and plenty
of features to speed up the build
process the full-size case window paired
with the cable mod strips really scores
the rigsum style points as well
unfortunately I didn't have time to play
with the lights on the GTX 980 so let me
know in the comments if you'd like to
see a full system lighting demo in a
future video
one erroneous decision I made during
this build was overlooking the cases 140
millimeter fan support at the front and
replacing them with two 120 s like some
dirty pleb but rest assured a pair of SP
140 s should be arriving on my doorstep
any minute now so I'll be swapping those
in later overall I really like how this
bill turned out with a fresh copy of
Windows still yet to be installed I'm
feeling pretty confident that our new
system here will do some damage in the
VR space but more than anything I just
can't wait till I can verify that for
myself that's gonna do it for now guys
before you go don't forget to toss me a
