to you by fractal design MSI and cable
mod check out the links in the
description below or the Academy will
revoke Leo's Oscar what is this was a
site enthusiasts class gaming 4k 60 at
Ultra IQ preset with doom yeah ok no big
deal ooh ooh
powered by Vega and Rison oh snap this
this might be the first Vega demo that
I've ever seen in person
and rising for that matter but this is
pretty impressive guys were actually
seeing above 60 60 Hertz or 60 frames
per second I should say with this AMD
combo GPU CPU setup which is really
impressive again this is at 4k we're
getting really smooth frame rates I
played the I played a little bit just
earlier and the playback is super fluid
and AMD is super excited about this they
still have a lot of work to do they say
but things are looking super promising
right now I'm saying super a lot because
it's just a super word but basically I
was talking to one of the reps and he
was telling me that the the rising ship
that they're currently working with at
at the current state is just about on
par with the 6700 K that's a core i7
from Intel which is definitely very
promising and as far as Vega is
concerned we're actually looking at
perhaps right now as of now a 10%
increase in performance over the GTX
1080 and mind you that's with an
engineering board and in like alpha
drivers so imagine imagine the
possibilities hopefully we see an even
bigger increase come final release date
but impressive demo right here for AMD
and I don't know if you guys can hear
but there's quite a bit of fan noise but
that's because they've actually taped
out the entire top panel here so that
you know media people like me can't look
inside and see see stuff so I think they
just cranked the fan to 100% obviously
this is a reference cooler so I'm
probably a single blower style fan and
look at this you know actually if you
feel the top here it's really not it's
really not too warm at all which is a
good sign considering that this is all
closed off with tape it's pretty pretty
cool and actually it's fairly cool here
I can feel some heat right right about
there I can feel you Vega I can feel
your heart beating close to mine in sync
not the band okay I'm done another way I
forgot to mention this but according to
AMD both both the CPU and GPU in the
system are running its stock speeds
there's no overclocking here so that's
that's also cool check out this bad boy
holy smokes this is an I buy Power PC so
pre built of course but still looks
pretty glorious apart from just having a
ridiculous amount of hardware in here in
terms of GPU horsepower we do also have
our first liquor my first look actually
in person of the Asus Erica or Erica
I think it's Erica aim for motherboard
yep even at the Asus booth there were
there were no aim for board that I saw
so this is pretty exciting you kind of
get a look there of what it looks like
it maybe there's definitely no like
crazy heat sinks or anything it's it's
not like a gamer centric board it looks
like but but there you have it folks
it's rocking the am for water block
there with a rising chip underneath
alright check out the same for
motherboard this is from Mac Sun I've
actually never heard of this
manufacturer before I think it's maybe a
Chinese brand but it is an AM for
socketed motherboard for the rising CPU
and you can see there's been a lot of
like controversy I'm like why they
change their their socket type as most
of you guys probably know by now I'm
you're going to need to buy an am for
specific CPU cooler in order to fit on
this new socket it's actually because of
the CPU the risin chip has more pins
than the am3+ platform did so because of
that they actually had to widen the
mounting points for for the brackets and
that actually obviously requires a new
cooler so I thought that was kind of
interesting we finally have an answer
maybe maybe I'm just late to the party
but now we kind of know why you're going
to actually need to buy a new aim for
cooler when these bad boys launch right
here we're taking a look at a bio
starboard this is a says racing on it so
this is the be 350 gt3 and of course be
350 is a different chipset than 370 X
however the cool thing is that even
though it's a bit more mainstream and
economical you're still going to be able
to overclock your Rison chip on this
chipset so kind of get the best of both
worlds is so to speak and obviously I
don't know if you guys have heard this
yet but all the rise and chips will be
fully unlocked so you will be able to
overclock them
pretty much anyone with the motherboard
of this caliper pretty sweet alright
y'all that is going to wrap it up for my
coverage of AMD here at CES 2017 I want
to thank my sponsors so much for making
this trip possible MSI fractal design
and cable mod go ahead and check out
their links in the description below for
more information on that thank you all
so much for watching and stay tuned for
more CES coverage of CES I was awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
