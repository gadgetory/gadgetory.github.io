these bluetooth headphones from
photovoltaic stairs living room where I
watch movies from my htpc is right down
the hall from their bedroom so cranking
up the sound bar after 10 p.m. when they
go to sleep would pretty much make me a
scumbag roommate I've always been a big
advocate of wired headphones for their
superior sound quality and power but
this is the first time where I've needed
sound isolation at a distance as my HTPC
sits about eleven feet from the couch
I'm also on a fairly tight budget at the
moment so finding headphones with
exceptional price and performance was a
top priority it wasn't long before I
came across the phbt h3 from
photovoltaic and 900 reviews I bought 2
pairs to see if they lived up to the
hype and I got a say well let's take a
closer look at the headphones first the
phbt h3 SR Bluetooth 4.0 compliant and
incorporate a closed back design they
Sport 240 millimeter drivers with an
impedance of 32 ohms and the battery
life offers 12 to 15 hours of playback
time and takes 3 hours to fully charge
when plugged into a power source via
microUSB a red light appears on the left
ear cup to indicate the device is
charging once fully charged the light
turns off the headphones have a wireless
range of 33 feet and work best with no
barriers between them and the Bluetooth
enabled device and as an unexpected
bonus feature that I completely
overlooked when purchasing the
headphones there's a built-in microphone
which allows this device to be used as a
headset for video chatting or taking
phone calls when paired to your smart
phone which I'll touch on later inside
the box are the headphones themselves
which come packaged in a slim hardshell
travel case there's a user guide
microUSB charging cable and a 5 foot 3.5
millimeter cable which you can use with
the headphones to save battery life or
if your battery is just dead entirely I
have to admit I was impressed with the
box and packaging of the product for $50
Bluetooth headphones I was expecting
them to come in a paper bag but the
presentation here makes for a great
first impression and ultimately a sign
of what's to come
now the extremely low price of this
product was reason enough for me to be
skeptical of certain attributes
most prominently the build quality but I
was pleasantly surprised by photos
exceptional engineering both the
headband and the frame of the ear cups
are made of a smooth matte black plastic
construction that's soft to the touch
the outer sides of the ear cups are also
plastic but implement a stylized brushed
aluminum look which make these
headphones look like they're worth a lot
more than they really are
the headband can flex and Bend
effortlessly without feeling like it's
going to crack or break and same goes
for when pulling apart the headphones to
accommodate larger head size despite
being super thin the metallic
retractable ear cuffs feel sturdy and
don't wiggle it all when adjusting
articulating the ear cups also leaves no
hesitation as the points at which
they're mounted to the headband are very
tight and secure the headband and ear
cups are lined with soft foam padding
wrapped in a faux leather material that
seems to be well stitched together
pivoting ear cups outward is smooth and
easy but not so easy that they swing out
whether or not supposed to overall the
build quality of this product goes far
beyond the expectation of other wireless
headphones in its class after the
headphones had checked out in the build
quality department I was certain that
putting them on would feel like my head
was in a c-clamp
but the phbt h3 surprised me yet again
the stretchy headband naturally retracts
into a fully closed position for
portability but actually has a very
slight clamping force which puts very
little pressure against your head while
remaining snug that along with the
retractable and articulating ear cups
make these headphones fit like a glove
regardless of head size I should note
that the foam padding around the ear
cups surrounds my average sized ears
perfectly so if you have notably larger
ears they may get partially covered by
the padding the padding on the headband
is comfortable too and the fact that
these are so lightweight makes it easy
to forget I'm wearing them even after
prolonged use without a doubt these are
the most comfortable headphones I've
ever worn at this price point now some
of the challenges wireless headphones
face over their wired counterparts are
button layout and ergonomics for
playback control and wireless
responsiveness on this model all of the
buttons and ports are conveniently
located on the two ear cups on the left
ear cup is the built-in microphone a
play/pause button and the next and
previous track buttons which are placed
immediately adjacent to each other but
have raised surfaces on opposite ends to
easily differentiate the two on the
right ear cup our volume up and down
buttons also adjacent with raised edges
the power button which has a couple
additional functions and micro USB
and 3.5 millimeter ports with connected
rubber caps all the buttons on both ear
cups rest behind or underneath your ears
allowing any button to easily be pressed
with your thumbs the port location is
fine but their rubber caps are jointed
at the middle and sometimes removing and
replacing one cap causes the other to
pop out nothing to fuss about but a
minor design flaw worth mentioning for
future revisions the device can be
turned on by holding down the power
button for a few seconds upon which the
LED indicator on the left ear cup will
flash blue turning off the device is
done in the same fashion hold down the
power button for 2 to 3 seconds until a
solid red light appears momentarily
letting you know the device is off the
secondary function of the power button
is used to pair the headphones to
another Bluetooth capable device hold
down the power button for 5 seconds
until the LED flashes red and blue this
indicates the headphones have entered
discovery mode for the next two minutes
and within that time will show up on
another devices radar allowing you to
make a connection this pairing process
is quick and easy and functions as it
should finally the power button is used
to answer an end phone calls when paired
with a smart phone if you're listening
to music from your smartphone for
example and you receive a call the music
stops playing and a ringtone can be
heard directly through the headphones
press the power button once to answer
the call then again to end the music
then resumes playing this device
performs quite well as a headset and I
didn't experience any delays when
answering or ending calls there are only
a few times when listening to music that
pressing the track selection buttons
took a second or two to register but
apart from that this device is
incredibly responsive the design of
these headphones is well thought out and
facilitates fluid user interaction
provided you have two working thumbs up
until this point in the review the bth
3s have surpassed all my expectations
making me rethink everything I know
about budget wireless headphones but as
with any budget device corners must be
cut somewhere and that brings us to the
sound quality test where the results
actually seem to fall in line with my
expectations mids and high frequencies
veer towards the neutral side but are
rich and crisp making voices string
instruments and pianos sound great
classical music rock and even light
electronic music proved to offer a
pleasurable listening experience where
the drivers fall short however is in the
low frequencies bass reproduction is a
bit shallow at times and lacks the
fullness needed to really drive hardrock
dubstep or loud
scenes of course not everyone prefers
the sound of deep thumping bass and most
casual listeners will hardly notice it
in fact if you're a seasoned audiophile
with ears like a hawk
chances are you have no interest in this
video if not for the warm sound
signature of my sexy voice the closed
back design of the headphones means a
limited soundstage and short spatial
distance which is to be expected so
don't feel like you're in the Coliseum
when watching gladiator overall I was
unable to detect any hissing or
artifacts that might result from the
wireless connection during media
playback in phone calls incoming voices
during calls and video chat are clear on
both ends and the microphone performs
sufficiently for its intended use now I
tried to be as objective as possible
when scoring this category because for
the last two years I've been spoiled by
the rich open sound of my dt 880 pros
but of course these are studio quality
headphones that cost me 250 bucks so
there's really no sense in comparing the
two if sound reproduction is all that
I'm looking at the bth threes sound
decent for a $50 wireless headphone
solution they sound great
now as informed consumers we're all
aware that no device is perfect and in
many cases each product has that one
fatal flaw that could potentially deter
us from making a purchase sure enough
the BT h3 has an Achilles heel of its
own which is sound leakage for being
closed back headphones there's virtually
no sound containment in a quiet room
sound is audible at just 15% volume and
becomes distracting at 50% where you can
start to hear the details of the audio
now obviously sound leakage isn't going
to be a problem for everyone take my
case for example even if I was in my
living room watching an action movie at
100% volume my grandparents would never
be able to hear it from their bedroom
likewise if you plan on using these at
your home computer or while cleaning the
house this doesn't pose an issue however
if you intend on using these headphones
on an airplane or next to your
significant other before bedtime don't
be surprised if they politely ask you to
turn it down alright so after carefully
reviewing all aspects of these
headphones how do they measure up
overall well given their price point the
build quality comfort and design are
something to be marveled I swear there
are far more expensive headphones on the
market right now that could take some
cues from photo
these areas while an excellent solution
for home use their portability and
lightweight construction also make them
ideal for storage and travel the device
is easy to pair has great battery life
with a quick charge time
ergonomic design once you get used to
the smaller button size they offer great
sound quality on a budget but the bass
reproduction is nothing to write home
about and as I just discussed the sound
leakage is so bad he'll never need
another splitter but this will only be a
deal-breaker for some despite a few
minor flaws and one major one it's hard
to believe this device only cost $50 at
the time of shooting this video all
things considered these are some of the
highest quality Bluetooth headphones you
can find at this price point and for
that it's earned a four out of five
rating and the first-ever awesomesauce
value award given to products with
phenomenal price to performance scaling
let me know what you guys think of these
headphones in the comments below and if
you know of a worthy opponent in its
class also toss me a like if you enjoy
