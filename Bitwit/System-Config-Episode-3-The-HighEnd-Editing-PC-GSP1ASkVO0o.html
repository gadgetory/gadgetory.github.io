by Corsair
back in the day when I first started
editing home videos of my GI Joes I was
about as fast as a Mexican standoff
between two koalas
they have poseable thumbs I checked so
technically that scenario was possible
as years went by I learned my hotkeys
and developed my craft until I was no
longer limited by my skill but by the
performance of my computer luckily that
just meant my family had to wait a few
more hours before watching my debut of
saving plastic Ryan but in a
professional workspace having a slow
system could cost a production company
several thousand dollars in poor
productivity and render times today I
helped a professional overcome this
costly situation on episode 3 of
system-config
hello my name is Jacob Brumfield I work
for jump creative we are an
entertainment marketing and production
company we do everything from 3d TV
shows to social media marketing we will
be using this computer for motion
graphics for rendering raw files for
editorial and we'll be using it for
color correction we'll be using
DaVinci Resolve After Effects and avid
my current system is a Apple Mac Pro
it's like from 2009 and it's just
outdated and this is gonna be like
quantum leaping one of the main reasons
why we're upgrading to this system and
away from our Mac Pro is because it's
render time simply that it's the artists
need to be creating instead of waiting
for a ram preview or something to render
for this new PC we're looking to spend
about 3 to 4 ok
the goal for this upgrade is to decrease
render time and increase increase
productivity that's why I called title
I'm looking for a hot rod that's what I
want this thing to be all right guys I
have brought Jakob into my humble abode
and I've actually asked him to bring in
his old system the one that he was just
telling you guys a little bit about so
the reason why I had you bring it in is
because I just wanted to take a look at
where you're coming from take a look at
some of the hardware inside we're gonna
go over the specs just briefly and then
from there we can do a little
performance test of it and just see what
you've been working with so far sound
good sounds great alright so I'm gonna
pop this the this guy off see what's
under the hood I believe it just lifts
up like that
actually never disassembled a MacPro
before like this so this is new to me
I'll take that for you so underneath
we've got this looks interesting Apple
always has a very innovative way of
mashing their hardware together first up
I know that this is rocking a quad-core
processor right an Intel Xeon processor
which is actually a fairly decent piece
of hardware but it is fairly dated as
well you said this was 2008-2009 yeah
something like that so I'm still still
getting a little bit sluggish there and
the memory is kind of interesting why
don't you pull that out really quick and
we can take a look at it I also use a
can of compressed air probably probably
wouldn't hurt from that either yeah okay
this is really interesting so we've got
a total of eight sticks of memory and I
think these are two gig modules so we've
got 16 gigs and that's ddr2 memory so
we're definitely dealing with the we're
having a blast from the past right now I
believe it's running at 667 megahertz so
but this is kind of an interesting
layout nonetheless they've actually
taken all of the dims and installed them
onto a single PCB and then from there
you just kind of slide it back in so
I'll just let you go ahead and do that
the video card is this guy right here
right I believe that's that's all just
integrated power right I think it's just
getting power directly from the
motherboard it's a 70 300 GT so if you
guys look up the specs on that or I
could just tell them to you right now it
has half a gig of memory 512 megabytes
of gddr3 on a video card so as Jacob
pulls that guy out here yeah there you
go all right so you've got a heatsink on
there there's your PCI Express slot
it's an old timer you got to love that
that bright green PCB there's something
very nostalgic about it so this is
definitely an outdated system it still
works nonetheless but the rate at which
things are advancing in the
post-production world you need your
hardware to kind of advance along with
it
absolutely so I think with that said
let's get down to the nitty-gritty and
see how this thing actually performs in
kind of a post-production workflow
alright great let's do it
alright guys so we finally booted up
into the desktop it took us a whopping 2
minutes and 41 seconds so within that
time Jacob and I actually had a nice
little lunch so now that we're all
energized and ready to keep going we
actually have redcine-x pulled up here
which is a nice program that's used to
look at dailies and look at your footage
and it'll do a lot of transcoding
functionality but that's basically the
gist of it and also we have a fork
uncompressed raw file here that's
actually taken from a that Jacob and his
team of junk creative did four new egg
the company I work for for those of you
who didn't know I was four eggies video
is a thing that we did at CES really
cool productions but this is a clip from
that and we're basically just gonna do a
quick run-through and see how it does
playback at different resolutions so why
don't you walk us through that Jacob
alright cool so I've loaded a couple of
these into the media bin and we'll see
if we can play it back we're at eight
resolution right now or eight quality
and it's looking alright so far it'll
play back if we go to quarter you'll see
that it'll play back for a bit and then
it thinks but definitely like more than
a hiccup I mean it just it completely
stops it's really not work I want
real-time is already gone at a quarter
resolution and then at half quality we
we run into an issue where it takes it
even a while to load the frame well and
then for playback it it'll sit there and
think for a while and it'll it'll jump
into playback and once it jumps in it
goes for about a second less than a
second and stops again so just one more
test before we actually move on to the
hardware of your new system and that's
gonna be a render test we're gonna take
a clip 4k uncompressed
once again and we're just gonna render
it and see how long it takes because
honestly that that can take a long time
if you're running with a slow system
right right right : so what kind of clip
do we have on what settings we're gonna
be transcoding with we have a red raw
file from the shoot and he was talking
about earlier and we're gonna we're
gonna export it as an MXF test okay now
it's rendering and exports pain and how
large would you say this file is like
how many gigs is this is this one file
that weird this one file is it's likely
seven or eight gigs okay and do you know
the length of the clip about okay it's
fifty seconds so a fifty second clip at
4k uncompressed is taking 14 minutes
almost 15 minutes to render this one
file and it's not even a minute long so
hopefully hopefully we can actually
squash that number down significantly
total you build so why don't we
transition switch gears here and
talk about the actual hardware that
we're going to be putting into this new
awesome editing rig for an editing rig
of this caliber it's imperative that it
can support a large capacity of
high-speed memories while offering
substantial PCIe support so the Ivy
bridge-e platform seems like an
appropriate choice with its quad channel
memory interface and a ridiculous amount
of PCIe lanes at the heart of this x79
build is the core i7 49 30 K which
supports six cores and twelve threads to
help Jacob minimize those render times
since this is a workstation PC it makes
sense to go with the workstation board
so here we have the Asus p9 X 79 ws
workstation motherboards will generally
build with higher grade componentry than
their standard or gaming series
counterparts enhancing their performance
and increasing reliability high
resolution video editing is definitely a
task that benefits from lots of
high-speed Ram so we decided to go with
this Corsair Vengeance quad channel
memory kit rated at 20 133 megahertz and
due to the awesomeness that is the x79
platform there's four more empty bin
slots in case Jacob wants to expand his
memory bank even further later down the
line the video card of choice is nvidia
quadro k 4000 with three gigs of gddr5
memory and 768 cuda cores this beast of
a workstation card is crafted entirely
by nvidia to ensure supreme reliability
and integration with professional
applications the card retains an
unobtrusive single slot form factor and
notable features like 10-bit color depth
is sure to aid with accurate color
correction in DaVinci Resolve cooling
our 4930 K is the H 100 I all in one
liquid cooler from Corsair aside from
great thermal performance thanks to the
240 millimeter radiator and 2sp fans the
Corsair link software is handy for
monitoring temperatures and controlling
fan speeds straight from the OS 4 power
we have the corsair ax 860 watt power
supply it's fully modular 80-plus
platinum certified and comes with black
sleeve cables that are long enough to
accommodate larger cases it can also go
incognito when the system is idling or
doing basic tasks stopping the fan
completely for silent operation moving
away from the sluggish load times of the
Mac Pros mechanical hard drive we're
throwing in an SSD for our operating
system and the bulk of applications
Jacob will be using to make 10 videos
Corsairs neutron GTX has a wicked fast
Lam controller for data intensive tasks
and does an outstanding job in read
consistency meaning right performance
won't be heavily compromised as the
drive fills up of course we still need a
mechanical drive to store the bulk of
data that will be captured on a regular
basis so we
the WD black 2 terabyte hard drive since
jump creative already has a backup
server with a serious raid array from
which they work from it eliminates the
need to set up a raid configuration here
which is why more than one hard drive in
this case would be superfluous now as we
all know optical media hasn't been as
necessary these days but every now and
again a situation arises where you wish
you had installed an optical drive in
your rig so with the prospect of better
safe than sorry we've included this
combo blu-ray drive from Asus I also
thought it'd be a good idea to throw in
this card reader from Roseville to help
streamline the capturing process when
shooting on flash media the beats having
to fiddle with an external card reader
and it's advertised to support 40
different types of memory cards all of
which I'm sure Jacob will be using
rounding out this lineup of parts is our
chassis the corsair 750d from their
obsidian series is an excellent choice
for an editing system in part to having
great air flow a spacious interior for
large hardware and generous support for
additional hardware like having 9
expansion slots it also has a classy
aesthetic and a large side panel window
to appreciate those pretty workstation
components adding on a copy of Windows 7
Professional for our operating system
brings the total cost of this build to
3200 dollars veering towards the shy end
of jump creatives budget and since
looking at all this perfectly packaged
hardware is giving me major building
xiety I think it's time that we put this
together
all right the build is finally done
we've put all of the hardware together
this thing looks pretty freakin sweet if
you ask me it's great and I'm assuming
it's going to be somewhat of a
powerhouse when we get into the actual
performance test which we're gonna do in
a moment I briefly just did want to
mention a few of the shortcomings or a
few of the obstacles that I faced when
building the system one of which was the
video card the Quadro k4000 that's
actually the second k4000 that we
purchased because the first one was DOA
it was completely dead
I was troubleshooting for two or three
hours just thinking it's gotta be me
it's user error clearly because these
things are extremely reliable that's
what they're built for but sure enough I
did enough troubleshooting to the point
where I realized it's just dead so I'm
shoot the RMA and Vidia got that to me
right away so thank you would video and
this one works out beautifully so it's
gonna serve you very well the other
thing is that I did have a card reader
that I wanted to install but completely
forgot to get the adapter it's a three
and a half inch card reader these are
five and a quarter inch bays didn't have
the adapter so maybe that's something
that Jacob and his team can install
later if they need that type of
connectivity I think there was a couple
things that you were gonna even add-on
further to this system one of which was
gonna be dual booting correct yeah we
were gonna I want to dual boot it into
Lennox because we have DaVinci which
runs in an enterprise level and Linux
that really benefits by the speed
performance that Lennox can bring to it
cuz you can add other nodes and a lot
more cards and other stations to help
with rendering so you just offload some
that Duty somewhere else the other thing
we're looking at is probably putting a
black magic the 4k extreme card in there
to soar so we can get the 4k out monitor
capabilities along with the new red
rocket card ya heard that really helps d
Baird this
this red footage sweet sounds good
you've got plenty of open PCIe slots to
help you with that there's four more in
there that's great why don't we start it
off by booting this thing on and kind of
starting off where we left off with the
boot test I think the time to beat is
two minutes and 41 seconds which I don't
know man I don't know if we can do it
it's gonna be tough
fingers crossed here we go I got my
timer right here and go
I like the digital readout on the board
yeah it's a it's a debug LED so if
there's anything that's wrong with the
system it'll spit out a code you can
actually look that code up in a legend
in the manual it'll tell you exactly
what's wrong like oh that's great stick
of memory not seated so you don't have
to sit there for a couple hours
troubleshooting he'll just have it right
there for you I really like that so
we're already starting Windows we got
the windows logo I gotta get ready to
stop this Oh Windows updates we've been
punked we've been punched oh no we have
to do this twice doesn't count
we're cut are we doing that three two
one start boot my guess is it's gonna
boot up about 30 seconds or so if I had
to guess ready oh stop
Oh nope I gotta keep going aha dammit
okay so that was probably about three
seconds that I need to add on because
the little pinky the icon was still
going so that's about 34 seconds it's
not bad 34 second through time down from
2 minutes and 41 seconds so that's not
terrible
yeah it's great now the next test would
be to do the the playback test yeah
let's check this guy out
let's reopen redcine-x and take a look
at that same we're gonna be using the
same clip that we were using in the last
computer for the Mac Pro quality and 1/8
was able to handle it pretty well they
could play 1/8 so you play it real time
so of course this is gonna be able to
match that at least it looks extremely
smooth no problems now 1/4 is where we
started to see a hiccup or two at the
lastest it would play for a couple of
seconds and it would stall yeah the play
though install gotcha
so let's see how this fares
so far so good no hiccups no still going
real time all right all right true test
half rest it's gonna hiccup never Wow
okay so awesome you guys can clearly see
that we're having no issues at all
running this real time even up to half
quality
can we see what whole entire full
quality looks like okay so we're getting
a bit of choppiness here a little bit of
stuff yeah but it's still not it's still
play it's still plays it's not coming to
a halt like it was a quarter with Mac
Pro so all-in-all this is looking really
good awesome so I think the next test I
think we're ready to do our vendor test
so we're actually just gonna use the
exact same settings as we work with with
the Mac Pro it's once again it's a 50
second clip and it's 4k uncompressed res
okay make sure settings are the same
okay where should we put this guy I like
putting things on the desktop cuz I can
see it I don't forget about it it
doesn't like hide in my system forever
holy crap it's it's going it's almost
done fifty percent 10 seconds ETA Wow
okay alright so it's done and that took
I didn't even have time to press the
timer that must have been less than 10
seconds yeah so we went from 14 minutes
and 11 seconds I believe 14 minutes to
10 seconds less than 10 seconds that's I
don't even know what percent increase
that is of speed but it's extraordinary
that's extraordinary well you guys are
in good shape now hopefully this will
get to save you guys a lot of time and I
know in the film industry time is money
absolutely this is gonna be a huge help
and improvement to you guys and is this
the first PC that you're actually
integrating into your workflow or one of
the first ones yeah it's it's our first
one and we're planning on going directly
into just all pcs we're getting out of
the Mac ecosystem awesome sounds good
man well if you need another PC you know
we're fine but you have for sure man
thanks Jacob thank you very much for
your time well thank you and thank you
guys for watching this video if you guys
enjoyed it please like and subscribe to
awesomesauce news if you have an hour
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
