this is the defined 6 from fractal
design let's check it out
alright well here she is
doesn't look as good as it could because
there's still some plastic on the
tempered glass side panel here which I'm
going to remove right now for ya again
again again again should really wear an
anti-static wristband Oh
round 2 alright that looks a little
nicer I guess we can continue this is
once again the define our 6 from fractal
design successor to the define our 5 I
guess a direct successor to that case
but there's definitely a pretty
expansive list of defined cases now here
at the end of 2017 we just had the
defined C defied C tempered glass and
defied C mini I think those were the
most recent ones and there was the
define s before that to find our v to
find our 4 and yeah so it's kind of
interesting to see the defined series
evolved with all of the PC case trends
you know with the definer v we saw it
the option for removable drive cages and
then the defined C brought us tempered
glass and the power supply shroud and so
I'm looking forward to seeing what the
r6 has in store for us today
this is an ATX mid tower now the MSRP
for the tempered glass model that I have
with me today is 150 US or 140 9.99 if
you don't care about tempered glass and
you want to do away with it and replace
it with a steel sound dampen piece of
steel then it's 20 bucks cheaper so
there's that but the tempered glass
looks really nice I guess I could talk
about that really quick it doesn't look
like it's tinted very much at all I mean
it's got some black borders on the
but I guess borders on the edges kind of
redundant but you know what I mean it
doesn't look too tinted which I like I
actually don't like tinted side panels
unless it's very very light you get two
thumb screws here but I think the thumb
screws are just to reinforce the side
panel in case you want to be shipping it
or moving it around a lot because you
have you actually don't need thumb
screws at all to put this thing back
into place you can see here as it's
already sort of mounted you just kind of
press it and it locks into place feels
feels pretty sturdy it doesn't like
wobble or anything if you move the case
so that's good seems fairly high quality
let's see popping it out though you kind
of have to be careful because there's no
like protective guard or latch the
bottom to catch the glass so like if you
were if you had this case on the glass
table you wouldn't want to like
accidentally drop it glass on glass
might might not end well for you but it
looks pretty pretty nice there's an
obviously no room for sound dampening
material here so not too big of a
surprise there I should not put this on
top of the thumbscrew let me try popping
this guy back on just to see how it goes
looks like yeah slide it in on the front
end first and then all the way back so
it actually pops in very easy the only
thing I'll say is that it's kind of hard
not to get fingerprints on it in the
process so I might want to have some
Windex handy when you have it whenever
you have pop this guy on and off let's
move on to the front though the entire
front panel of the case is genuine
brushed aluminum it's not faux brushed
aluminum like we've seen on other
defined cases in the past so that's kind
of nice it is a bit more prone to
fingerprints in that sense but as long
as you're okay and aware of that it's
very easy to open and close the door
without actually touching the the
aluminum there there's tons of
ventilation on the sides and as long as
you don't mount the fans on the outside
of the radiator bracket like I did with
the elite belt but that was intentional
then you should be able to get some
healthy airflow there's like really big
openings there's no mesh in these in
these vents but there is a mesh filter
that is removable it's just beneath the
single five and a quarter inch Bay and
very easy to pop out this is my first
time I have not liked
inspected this case at all I looked at
the reviewers guide and the spec sheet
thoroughly but I have not actually put
my hands on this case what you're
watching me do it for the first time
underneath the dust filter at the front
here you get two included GP fourteen
fans with those traditional white blades
and it looks like you've got some pretty
hefty radiator mounting options at the
front here you can either do up to a two
eighty or a 360 which is very nice very
nice indeed
Sarab dust filter at the front yeah
there is yeah hahaha you're this look at
Leos bad boy whoo it looks like we've
got some fan mounts at the bottom of the
case apparently not just filtration for
your power supply fan but I think you
can do to 120 s or 140 s at the bottom
of the case as well being able to just
sort of wipe out all the dust from
everything at the bottom of your fan all
at the same time is pretty nice did I
mention you can flip this door like if
you don't want it to open from the right
side you can actually reverse the
mounting so that it opens from the left
that's pretty cool
it's in beador stris sorry it's also got
some Sam damping material underneath
very nice as well
LED right there very traditional for the
define series front panel we've got what
looks to be 2 USB 3.0 2 USB 2.0 they're
all type-a ports a very nice heavy-duty
power button reset that's a little bit
more difficult to press which is a comes
up for that mic and headphone jacks now
yes I know for $150 where's the USB
type-c Kyle where where why well look
what I have here an aftermarket front
panel alternative that has USB type-c
3.1 gen2 supported all the other
connectors and buttons are the same the
only difference is that it's got a type
c header on it or a type c port and this
is actually sold separately and the
reason that is is because there's a very
loud minority when it comes to front
panel type C a lot of there aren't a
humongous a large number of people who
want it but the ones that do want it are
very vocal about it in the comments and
the forums and stuff but the majority of
us don't really have enough type C
devices on hand to really warrant or
justify spending that much more in a
case simply for that privilege so this
is an option if you want
spend a little bit more to take
advantage of that connectivity but
they're you know fractals trying to keep
the cost down for the majority of the
market who just really isn't ready for
type-c yet so it's nice that they have
the option though they also have another
add-on option for for a riser card there
is vertical GPU mounting in this case
that's supported and that's we'll talk
about that later on but kind of nice
that you get this guy just in case you
want it and then we've also got a giant
module it cover just a single mod you've
ever that looks let's see how do you
actually how do you take this off you
just press it it looks like you just
kind of know you don't press it
I'm that would have been nice that would
have been nice fractal just saying if I
could have just like to - oh oh oh oh I
stand corrected ladies and gentlemen
there's a nice big button a nice big ol
fat button the back ear case that
actually pops the whole thing out oh
this is so much better than the old
module system and it's got some mesh
underneath it so it looks like there's a
dust filter here is that is that right
am I seeing this right this is like I'm
discovering so much discovering so many
things for the first time how do you
take this out ah they're finally
interesting okay cool look at this it's
just a giant dust filter now the top
module in cover does have sand damping
material of course very sturdy yeah I
mean I could I could definitely I could
Bend it because I'm strong but you know
it's not gonna it's not gonna
accidentally get all twisted up very
high quality very durable and then this
is a plastic made of plastic very
similar as the front dust filter here
and I'm gonna pop it back in just see
what that looks like oh yeah oh yeah
that looks pretty good actually like I
like I just like the way it looks yeah
yeah that's a lot of ventilation right
there you know if you want to put a up
to a 420 blaze it radiator you can do
that up at the top of the case or up to
a 360 if you're going with some 120s but
hot damn it's looking good so far y'all
get back in there get back in there boy
know your role the right side panel is
just a piece of steel with some captive
thumbscrews let me just confirm if
they're captive okay oh they are not
captive why I don't know I should also
mention these are flexible mounting
strips both at the top and front of the
case and it looks like the ones here on
the top are positioned closer to the
tempered glass side of the case which
would give you more clearance for things
like your memory and DRM heatsink set
cetera moving on to the back yeah let's
see what we got it looks like your third
and final included GP 14 fan can also
support a 120 or 120 radiator but there
was no mention of 140 millimeter
radiator support just 120 or 140 fan you
got one two three four five six seven
expansion slots that are traditional
horizontal and then you've got two
vertical if you opt for the optional
riser card you can actually put a two
slot GPU in a vertical orientation in
this case something nuts seen before on
a defying case unless I'm totally wrong
about that I could be wrong about that
where is the riser card there was a
riser card I had to write a riser cable
haha so here it is it's pretty nice
actually it kind of has like a blacks
leaving around the the ribbon cable
itself some fractal design branding but
fractals basically taking the same
approach with this as they are with the
type-c front panel kit in the sense that
not everyone's gonna want vertical GPU
mounts in the vertical GPUs in their
case so this is an option if you want to
pay a little extra they'll ship one over
to you but they're not going to include
it with every single case with every
single unit and charge more for it when
only a fraction of people buying it or
actually gonna use it so I think it's a
good thing that you know for something
that's a bit more Miche to just sell the
accessories required to use it
separately for you know for those who
care and finally at the bottom here
we've got a power supply bracket that's
removable with two captive thumb screws
comes off just like that you mount this
to the back of your power supply and you
slot it in from behind pretty
straightforward nothing too fancy here
and that's pretty much gonna cover it
for the outside of the case I think on
that note just let's go ahead and start
building inside of this thing let me get
some parts out for you
be right back alright so it looks like
we've got some preinstalled standoffs
with a very happy one in the middle
there it's gonna help us got her in oh I
should probably put the IO shield in
first let's get this bad boy come out I
reckon we do the motherboard first and
the radiator second what's y'all say
good all right so that fits in lovely
perfect mount this sucker down alright
motherboard installed and to install the
radiator I'm wondering if this panel is
removable if the radiator bracket on top
of the case can actually be removed let
me check you know I think this is
removable guys we've got four screws
here I don't see any rivets it looks
like this side is just held in by some
and latches so I'm gonna go for it I'm
gonna say this is a modular radiator
bracket oh yeah definitely removable
sweet bonus points for that one I don't
let me get this guy matted I'll be right
back
so we've got our radiator mounted to the
bracket but before we install it in back
into the case there's one thing we can
do to make our lives a whole lot easier
and that is install or plug in our
12-volt CPU connector from our power
supply because once this radiator is in
there it's gonna be kind of hard to
access that plug so let's go ahead and
I've already sort of wired it to myself
off-camera it's kind of good to go i
actually have it running through this
rubber grommet here at the top of the
case there's actually two rubber
grommets for passing such cables through
so there it is
got our eight pin all our 12 our eight
pin 12-volt all plugged in and we're
ready for mounting the rest of this guy
so let's do that alright voila
totally installed the AIO just now no
problems all right so our build here is
coming along quite nicely haven't run
into too many snags so far I did want to
point out that I'm using a corsair fan
on our Celsius s24 here because this is
the same AO that we used for the yacht
PC and in the process one of the fans
just got misplaced and it probably
doesn't even work anyway
so yeah that's that explains that but I
already mentioned the two rubber
grommets that are at the top right above
the motherboard they they're big enough
to pass you know larger cables through
like your 12-volt CPU had no problem
getting that through there and then
we've also got some nice large three
large ones right here to to to the right
of the motherboard for your ATX etc USB
three SATA and then a large one at the
bottom here there's also a really small
cutout here that's not grommeted it
doesn't have a rubber grommet but it's
just a regular cutout that's for like
your HD audio and other small connectors
but these rubber grommets are really
nice they seem like they're like they're
actually like well stuck in there like
they're not gonna completely just fall
out once you start passing tables
through I'm not gonna get snagged on
anything and then you know obviously the
ones on the bottom here are gonna be for
your front panel connectors USB three if
you've got a header down there and say
that potentially because there's
actually the option fractal design
includes two two and a half range to
drive trays that you can mount
they're behind the motherboard tray
which is where they were originally when
I took it out of the box or you can
mount them right here on the power
supply shroud again it kind of goes
without saying that we have a power
supply shroud in this case so it just
has two little latches that go into the
it's a ventilated shroud by the way the
tons of ventilation at the top here and
then just a single captive thumb screw
that you would screw down like so so
it's completely tooless unless you
consider your hand a tool and then yeah
so you can either do one or the other or
both in either position looks looks
pretty nice and definitely easy to use
we'll save these from behind the
motherboard tray though since that's
where we're headed eventually and
towards the front of the case we get
sort of this wall of mystery and it's
got two thumb screws here which we'll
remove in just a moment but behind this
little wall here which is made of steel
high quality we have a couple drive
cages or drive trays I should say one
two three four and then there's five six
two more at the bottom here that are
sort of underneath the shroud and they
can house either three and a half inch
or four and a half inch drives and if
you wanted to buy additional trays you
know after the fact you can even slot up
to 11 I believe behind this little wall
here and it's all concealed it's hidden
very nicely but I'm kind of curious to
see what happens once we undo these
thumb screws here so let's pop this off
interesting let's let's flip this guy
around for you so you can see I won't
hoard it all to myself
here we can see the business end of
things and it looks like a single thumb
screw holding each of these trays in
place which is you know it's gonna take
you half the amount of time to undo it
compared to most that have two thumb
screws comes out like that these are
made of steel painted white
very nice they've got some rubber
stoppers or rubber rubber pads to reduce
noise and vibration and they look very
very sturdy very sturdy indeed there
were some people putting a lot of drives
in their system really gets them going
but I reckon a lot of you would also be
interested to see what kind of water
cooling capabilities this guy has and
obviously we already know that there's
plenty of rad support at the front of
this case if you wanted to put in a you
know a thicker radiator with a
push-pull configuration or something
like that there's probably no room to do
that with all of these trays taking up
space so let's just see what happens if
we remove all of them so what's neat
about this design is that the trays are
just kind of floating there's not like a
giant drive cage or some complex drive
cage but rather they're just sort of
mounted to the motherboard tray with
that one thumb screw and this front wall
that we saw the other side of just a
moment ago but you know when you take
the trays out it's pretty open there's
no there's no interior skeleton or
whatever that you're dealing with so
that's it's kind of nice it just opens
up the airflow a bit more and you still
have that wall concealing things but I
think there's a way to remove that wall
that plate if you wanted to you know I'm
gonna flip this case around again I
really need to invest in a lazy susan
okay so in order to remove this plate
here it looks like there are two screws
very accessible just regular Phillips
heads I'm gonna undo those and then it
looks like there's two more screws
possibly at the bottom of the case
alright here we go two screws at the
bottom
I like how I like the fact that you
don't have to remove the the power
supply dust filter at the bottom dust
filter to access these remove that so
from the looks of it there may be two
more screws or at least a few more
screws at the front here probably got to
pop off the front panel in order to
access them comes off pretty easily and
I like the fact that the front panel
isn't tethered by any of the front panel
connector cables so it's free we we've
got two screws that I would imagine oh
there we go
hey man come on oh jeez a little tricky
now that I have the a i/o installed the
radiator maybe I should just remove the
radiator bracket just to avoid
scratching anything remember kids always
read the manual it helps save time
and energy Anna oh yeah much easier
without the radiator in the way radiator
bracket and I think this guy this this
panel that we just removed can actually
be relocated to the back of the case
more towards the to be in line with the
motherboard tray just try to figure out
how exactly that fits all right it looks
like we've got it in position we just
gotta secure it down two screws in the
bottom all right now we can just receipt
our radiator and we mustn't forget the
attractive faceplate thing here go back
inside and voila
and now you'll see that this looks very
much more like a defined s or something
where it's just a bunch of empty space
here in the front for water cooling
radiators or if you just want some
unimpeded airflow you have that option
so you kind of get the best of both
worlds here with this case you have the
flexibility to have almost two
completely different almost completely
different internal layouts which is
pretty sweet where do the fan cables get
routed I guess it also goes without
saying while I'm here that you cannot
have a top radiator at least this long
or maybe even like you know I'd say you
probably couldn't get away with more
than like a 240 or so and still have an
optical drive but who uses those anymore
and then yeah where do the fan cables go
the fan cables I guess could go so it
looks like the only real cutouts to
route your fan cables through at least
at the front of the case here in this
configuration are these cutouts that we
saw the drive trace poking through
earlier so they're plenty big to route
your three or four pin fan cables or fan
connectors through and I kind of tucked
the wiring behind the fan sort of
between the fans and the back panel here
just to give us a cleaner look really
quick just want to show you the bottom
of the case here you can actually mount
a 240 or a 280 millimeter radiator or
fans if you like but that's kind of nice
and you just want to direct some airflow
upwards to your various components and
also the fact that the power supply
shroud is is well ventilated
would definitely also aid an airflow if
he were to mount any fans or radiators
down at the bottom there
alright power supply you guys remember
that I already plugged in the 12 volt
CPU connector so now I've gotta just
route the other guys here obviously we
have to route them through the back
before we slide the power supply through
and I can't confirm that there is not
enough clearance for you to actually
install the power supply from behind the
motherboard tray you have to do it from
the very rear of the case some cases let
you do both this is a rear entry only if
you know what I mean alright our power
supply has been installed with
relatively little effort all right so we
got a nice big CPU cooler cut out and
you can see here we actually have full
access to our am 4 backplate so that's
that's good news sometimes you'll have a
really large CPU cut out but it only it
only eclipses part of a bracket
especially larger ones and that's that's
no bueno so a good thing we've got a
fairly large one here that's in the
right spot and then we also have a 6 fan
6 fan hub one two three four five six
and looks like you can connect up to
three PWM devices as well that's that's
awesome so these are three pin these are
four pin and obviously you have see the
power to drive it with a four pin
connector that would go to your
motherboard that's nice especially for
gonna be doing some water cooling even
some push-pull configurations a lot of
fans those fans add up fast so it's nice
to not have to route them all to your
motherboard and have to resort to using
splitters and things like that
helps keep things tidy obviously as well
speaking of tidy we've got some tie-down
points and velcro straps to help us
along OOP that came out pretty easily
that's what she said so let me show you
where all the tie-down points are really
quick we've got one two three four five
six seven eight nine and then you've got
ten eleven twelve right here on the
actual front of the case and looks like
you've got some more year twelve
thirteen fourteen fifteen on the very
bottom of the chassis so plenty of tie
down points velcro straps to help you
with everything
of course the power supply shroud so you
can just kind of shove everything down
there if you really don't care
another thing that I should mention
before I forget is that you can still
house two three and a half inch drives
in the current configuration here after
we removed all those all those drive
trays it's not like you have to resort
to a two and a half inch drive only
system you can still mount two three and
a half inch mechanicals right that to
the back of this thing you just have to
pop off the that thumbscrew panel on the
front and yeah and you can install it
pretty easily so that's that's nice
super flexible
I'm also circling back to those drive
trays those two and a half inch drive
trays you can I did mention earlier that
you can mount them either on the power
supply shroud as I demoed before or
behind the motherboard tray and they
would go right here boom side-by-side
there's one and your other would go
right next to it so plenty of options it
is time to install our GPU black thumb
screws perks or white expansion slots
she's coming in hot so we've currently
got a gtx 980ti founders edition in here
with plenty of room to spare even if we
had the the drive trays reinstalled like
you know like the Lynx like so and stuff
you still have at least a good inch
maybe two before you run into clearance
issues and even then I mean it's so
flexible you can actually mount the
drives around where the GPU would extend
to that way you can just continue
extending I think the the manual said
four hundred and forty millimeters of
length for your GPU and that's that's
more than enough for most people as far
as the clearance from the CPU cooler if
you are going to be going with a tower
instead of an a i/o I think it's a
hundred and eighty-five millimeters of
clearance there and you get 300
millimeters of clearance for a power
supply before you run into any issues on
that note we're just about done here we
just got to wire everything up and call
it a day
all right system complete and it looks
really nice actually if you take all the
proper measures to use the right
grommets and you know the cable routing
holes and stuff it looks nice and tidy
and you don't really have to put in that
much legwork to make it look that way
because it's just it's a good design
it's got its really nice you know
full-length power supply shroud tons of
tie-down points behind the motherboard
tray velcro straps things like that
there's probably it's probably an inch
maybe a inch and a half inch and a
quarter of space behind there too so
plenty of room when you factor in the
basement and stuff and lots of seemingly
lots of airflow obviously go go over to
you know someone who's tested it
actually besides me like gamers Nexus
maybe has done some proper testing on
the airflow in this case but it looks
promising
then again you know you never know but
tons of radio support I like that and
it's gonna be great for custom water
coolers I wish there was a dedicated
reservoir mount I don't know maybe maybe
there is behind this little panel here
it didn't look like there was I could be
wrong I'll put a little annotation if
I'm wrong but that would be nice and
then also I have to say that one of my
favorite things about this case is that
somebody else could do a build in an r6
and it would look completely different
than mine not because of the components
that they chose but because of the
internal layout that they opted for
obviously I kind of went with a more
defined SS look by removing all of the
hard drive trays but you know somebody
else might might want that in place and
just have it fully stacked you know to
the brim with hard drives or something
like that so I'm a huge sucker for
flexibility I think it prolongs the
longevity so to speak of the case keeps
you from having to buy a new one just
for a different situation or scenario
and overall for 150 bucks I'm I'm pretty
happy with it I would buy this case for
150 bucks and my own money just because
I think it's very well thought out it's
built to last
my define R 5 and s are still both cake
and strong and this is built with the
same sort of quality and engineering as
those cases from what I can tell so over
all guys fantastic case good job fractal
once again go ahead and leave your own
thoughts comments concerns in the
comments below I'll be sure to read them
and check them out curious to hear what
you guys have to say as always feel free
to toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it I know it might have been a
little lengthy and kind of random I've
got awesome Hardware in about an hour
and I haven't even started taking my
notes so yeah this episode is gonna be
awesome
but yes that all that said go ahead and
check me out on floatplane if you want
to see videos like this up to a week
early without ads I'll put a link in the
description below
apart from that guys thank you so much
for watching have a good one and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
