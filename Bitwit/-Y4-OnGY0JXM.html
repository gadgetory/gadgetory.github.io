playing Max Payne 3 and this is the RPG
or role-playing game version of this
title because just like Max Payne
himself I will be drinking throughout
the entirety of this let's play did you
get that burp my breath of this video so
first before I jump into the game itself
you can see here I've where am I
graphics you can see here I've pretty
much put everything to very high shear
equality is about as high as it can go
high as as high as it is there's no very
high for shader quality I feel like
that's not fair
everything else gets to be very high
bashira quality has to reside it high it
can't go any higher than that
I don't think that's right but
everything else is pretty high very high
MSA for X and X and some tropic
filtering and that stuff that's
tessellations very high so let's play
the game
RPG Max Payne 3 RPG that's what I'm
calling this little series of mine new
what do you think guys easy medium hard
I feel like I might do hard I'm just
gonna be dying all the time let's do it
screw it alright this game is so intense
I love that by the way I've already beat
this game I played it I think I beat it
on hard back in the day back of the day
like this couple months ago all right
listen
let's game so good
I'm just gonna get settled in
placements like crap time to move on
get on with my life yes absolutely
I meant operating at 30 frames per
second right now this is crap
fraps totally kills your performance
just way too much I've said this games
already depressing this is like the
first five seconds of the game and I'm
already depressed seriously I think you
need to be drinking when you play this
game because I just make it so damn sad
my life is in shambles I'll never
recover from this 3 enter depression
brought to you by Prozac this honestly
playing this game when I first played it
the first time around it just it made me
so depressed that I didn't even feel
like playing the rest of it there are
certain time there's like I just need to
turn this off and play something happy
like watch Sesame Street for an hour
just cuz it's so sad he's just such an
alcoholic and like he probably just sits
at home playing video games wasted off
his ass making Let's Plays and uploading
them to YouTube it's pathetic
so I don't know I'd arrived in s√£o Paulo
a few weeks before I was working to
protection detail for the kind of people
who needed protection in a town like
this and what kind of town was this one
where I didn't speak the language and
then they didn't water down their drinks
so for now we seem to get along just
fine of course that was about to change
hey how's the cocktail scotch I never
mix my drinks cocktails are for bitches
massive buildings kind of impoverished
nation is living in a skyscraper 23
floors off the ground oh my god they're
going apeshit I guess this is it's time
for me to go bullet time on your asses
oh my god what I was not expecting this
so fast today did she like that I felt
like he had another chance to live good
got me five times in that period of time
oh yeah bullet time again sidewall not
walked in the stand a chance
oh yeah dance cowboy Oh dance I'm a
bitch
yeah Wow oops look terrible at this
right now I'm so scared for these people
because I am their only hope and I am
drunk as hell
there's no way I'm gonna say believe in
stupidity this may be both oh it's
definitely both oh I knew it I was back
taking risks
trying to save fallen women all right
here we go
pretzel in mouth here we go oh my god oh
my god I Jesus Christ I'll edit this
part out retry bitch you get bad first
time first time around heads red in the
face
I can swim too just a bonus
no not your dirty ass hands after you've
been doing your hands take those gun
Thanks fine don't shoot me Rodrigo was
too rich a prize for them to throw away
sure I'd have to work hard to getting
back but I knew the bad guys would want
the boss alive soon as much as I you
down-down your shit fuck all of you guys
fuck you screw you
get up on your feet dude one just kill
everyone here
yeah we're killing to sleep a bitch I
will edit this out alright so this video

firefight max with the sufficient
bloodshed I believe so I think I'm gonna
