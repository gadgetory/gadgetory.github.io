card today it's the msi geforce r-tx
2080 ti
lightening z don't be fooled by the
absence of a Z on the box it has a Z all
you got to do is pay attention to the
sticker the retail box is crap just look
at the sticker which clearly says
Lightning Z right there it's official
alright so we got the Z model which is
the fancy-pants one it's clocked faster
much faster out of the box than the non
Z SKU I think the non Z's like fifteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz this
is seventeen hundred and seventy mega
Hertz boost clock out of the box that
puts it around 200 megahertz faster than
a reference r-tx 20 80 TI and roughly
100 mega Hertz faster than a founders
edition 20 80 TI so this is perhaps one
of the fastest RT x 20 ATT eyes on the
market right out of the box which is
pretty exciting of course you're gonna
pay a pretty penny for this guy but hey
if budgets no option or you're just
looking for the best of the best this
could be a possible contender we're
gonna take a closer look at it let's
take the sucker into the box it's a big
box Somali am I doing this right oh no I
think it's upside down that's not like I
take things out of boxes for a living or
anything alright very nice casing
actually it's the documentation we have
a bracket anti-sag bracket so that your
GPU doesn't sag because this is a very
big card it's a matey bastard the triple
slot triple fan holy Toledo
so I didn't actually get a chance to see
this up close at CES and it is even
bigger and heavier than I ever expect it
this thing is gargantuan would be the
proper word look at that heatsink that
heat sink is ridiculous and you've got
the Torx fan 3.0 here I believe the two
outer fans have RGB lighting that looks
pretty cool it's their Phantom of the
Opera know what's it called what's it
called phantom of lighting it's their
phantom of lighting technology that's
built into these fans we'll take a
closer look at that later
now there's RGB all over this thing but
the card itself is black and gold MSI
has been on this huge gold kick lately
which I don't mind I'm kind of a fan you
know I like the gold trim that they've
been putting on some of their other
devices like their laptops and so forth
but bear in mind it is gold you can't
change it you got carbon-fiber accents
all over this card as well from the
front of the shroud here to the full
cover backplate which is also lined with
some plastic it's reinforced backplate
also to help eliminate GPU sag and just
give the board some added rigidity RGB
lighting right there you can see the two
little strips rip loop you've got
envy link SLI finger a fairly large LCD
screen which can give you some useful
real-time system diagnostics like clock
speeds temperatures and you can even add
your own animation and stuff maybe we'll
get around to that too just above that
as a dip switch that lets you choose
between two profiles whether you're
using the stock cooler or you're going
exotic ln2
this will also toggle be zero frozer
technology which basically reduces your
fan speed to zero RPM to the GPU fall
below sixty degrees Celsius we've got
triple eight pin power connectors which
means you're gonna need an efficient and
reliable power supply to drive this unit
effectively it also tells us that this
is a fully custom PCB with a nineteen
phase vrm at that again the heatsink is
massive it's actually two large stacks
that are being connected by a series of
six millimeter and eight millimeter
copper heat pipes all those pipes are
eventually leading to a nickel plated
copper base plate which is making direct
contact with the GPU for effective heat
dissipation throughout the part MSI also
advertises that they're using high-grade
thermal compound for the GPU which is
supposed to have better performance and
longevity
okay can we install it now now really
quick disclaimer before we continue here
I actually have to produce and record
the rest of this video from home because
of the new house it's a long story but
basically I can't shoot at the studio
right now I didn't feel like bringing my
entire equipment set over to the house
so I'm just gonna do a voiceover for the
rest of this video I'm sorry you won't
get to see my glorious face for the rest
of it I know that's the number one
reason why you guys subscribe but yeah
this is just one of those little hiccups
that I have to deal with during this
whole moving into a new house process so
with that out of the way let's continue
so I dropped the card in my Z 390 test
bed with a core I nine ninety nine
hundred K overclocked to five gigahertz
on liquid paired with 16 gigs of G
skills Sniper Elite ddr4 at 3400 speed
on an Asus prime z3 98 it only took me a
few minutes to find a stable overclock
but the 40 megahertz core clock offset
and 425 megahertz memory clock offset
don't expect any earth-shattering gains
here since the lightning Z chips already
come heavily tuned from the factory
still land at our core clock speed just
shy of the two gigahertz mark I will
take it temps we're hovering in the mid
70s nearing 80 C at times but never
quite getting there
fortunately far from chilly but super
respectable for an air-cooled tu 102 at
2 gigahertz I would guess that you'd
probably seen better thermals with one
of those liquid cooled RT X 20 ATT eyes
that debuted at CES
year like the asus rog matrix or EVGA z'
kingpin model but those also come with
the inconveniences and risks associated
with liquid cooling and when spending
one to two thousand dollars on a
graphics card some users may find peace
of mind with the lightning Z in a quiet
room you'd probably be able to hear the
card under load through a closed chassis
but it's definitely not loud enough to
break your concentration with in-game
audio present so for all intents and
purposes the card is quiet enough for me
both the LCD and RGB lighting are
controlled through the mystic light tab
with an MSI dragon Center and while the
lighting on the back plate and above the
LCD look great I'm not a hundred percent
sold on the fans I think it looks weird
with a dark fan in the middle I'm just
gonna say it I've spent all weekend with
the card and this design choice has not
grown on me at all the lighting on the -
lit fans also looks kind of cheap and
doesn't match the style of the other
lighting accents I know you won't see it
much in a typical case but I can't help
but feel a bit underwhelmed by the
implementation here the opposite is true
for the dynamic dashboard LCD the
digital readouts for things like GPU
temp clock speed and memory usage are
large enough to be read easily from
several feet away and while I didn't get
around to making any animations my
custom images from mspaint loaded just
fine you are limited to black and white
however for testing the CPU and GPU ran
overclocked with the settings I
mentioned earlier and were tested on
seven games at 2560 by 1440 and 3840 by
2160 with the exception of Metro last
light which kept crashing it for K for
some reason even with the system running
bone-stock I spent like half an hour
troubleshooting before finally giving up
so sorry about that we're also using the
latest wiffle driver at the time of
filming that's for 17.7 1 and here we go
so yeah big surprise
this card is stupid fast chewing up
every maxed out title at 1440p and 4k
right now there's virtually nothing it
can't handle and that's probably gonna
be the case for years to come
I didn't test any r-tx features but I
reckon the lightning Z eats rays for
breakfast before tracing them with its
butt like a Froyo dispenser sure it's
faster than nvidias founders addition I
would guesstimate five percent on
average based on my RT X 20 ATT I
launched a review but not by enough to
warrant the $400 premium with it's
insane $1600 price tag so assuming you
have the bankroll in the first place
only a deep deep infatuation with the
design and appearance of the cards would
really make it worth your dollar you're
single $1600 dollar I mean as far as I'm
concerned this card is a work of art a
statement piece reserved exclusively for
the ultra gaming elite and if you fail
to see the value in that you're you're
just a filthy casual pleb but that's all
I got what do you guys think of these
premium flagship cards like if you had
the money what features would a card
like this have to have for you to throw
down let me know in the comments if you
could toss a like on this video before
you go I'd really appreciate it and
subscribe to my channel or I will poop
in your water-cooling Luke yet another
reason to go air cooling thanks for
watching guys have a good one and I'll
see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
