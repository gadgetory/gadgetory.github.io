channel today I have a very special
product for you guys it is the NZXT hue
plus here it is look at that what is a
hue plus Kyle well you can see right
here it says advanced PC illumination
and they got a fancy picture with an
NZXT cooler and a geforce card over
there so what is this thing
well you can see what it does right here
in fact I've got a little bit of a
different format for today's video I
just thought it would work given the
walkthrough that we're about to take so
here is the LED setup here's the hue
plus in action you can see the unit is
actually installed right there next to
my SSD so SSD Q + right there but the
white LED on it and then I've got three
LED strips right now connected
circulating the entirety of this H 440
case right here and it's it's just going
wild and I've got the software right
here you can see on the screen we're
going to be going through and taking a
step by step look at what exactly this
software and device features and kind of
how you can change and customize the
look to match your aesthetic for your
your particular system now exactly what
is this by definition it's an LED strip
kit that does come included with for the
four LED strips so you can buy it for
about 60 bucks 60 USD with the included
four strips or you can pay a little bit
extra to get the one that has all eight
strips this does support only up to
eight total which i think is enough for
pretty much any case for the most part
but this is this particular one came
with four so I only was able to fit
three in this case which is a you know a
fairly decent sized mid-tower so I think
you'll be fine unless you're dealing
with a super large you know case labs
case or something like that with getting
the four LED strip version but
essentially you get four LED strips with
this that are RGB capable and as you can
see definitely RGB we're not we're not
talking about like a bit phoenix alchemy
strip that you know does red green blue
orange or purple or wieck's and you got
to kind of just pick which one you want
to go with and you're stuck with that
color for infinity and beyond
but the
this is actually the main highlight I
mean beyond the scope of all the cool
features and LED effects of this thing
is able to achieve I just think the fact
that we're seeing now this mainstream
RGB strip kit arrived on the market is
is a huge huge leap forward because I'm
sick and tired of having to swap out LED
strips because I decide to change the
look of a particular system it also
limits the functionality of that strip
you know I've got it I've got three LED
strips that in my in my box back here
that are that are red and I can only use
them when I'm going with a you know red
or you know somewhat red color scheme of
a build which is very limiting so this
kind of allows you to reuse it and
repurpose it for different builds in the
future older builds that you know or
your current bill that you want to
change the look of you know every every
so often however often it may be but I'm
getting a little bit off-topic here I
think you've got a pretty good idea of
what this thing is we're going to get
into what it can do in just a moment but
first I want to talk about the actual
unit itself because it's not just the
LED strips the hue plus unit is a two
and a half inch form factor more or less
a unit that is kind of the heart of this
product that everything revolves around
so as you can see from this image you
can actually mount it in pretty much any
space in a chassis where you could
otherwise mount a two and a half inch
drive now I say almost any space because
it is quite a bit thicker than a regular
seven millimeter SSD it's actually
almost more than twice the thickness of
the seven millimeter m5 Pro here so that
kind of limits you as to where exactly
you can fit it and in most places it
should be fine in any given chassis but
for example a lot of cases these days
are allowing two and a half inch drive
mounts behind the motherboard tray so
support for that where you've kind of
got a very limited height clearance in
terms of you know fitting the side panel
on with all the cable management and
whatnot it makes it limiting and I don't
know if this would be a really good size
to fit behind the motherboard tray I
think it's a little oversized for that
so maybe in a future revision I would
like to see this slimmed down quite a
bit
NZXT if you're watching make it the size
of an SSD next time or or get it a
little bit closer to that so we
really have some more flexibility and
customizability of where we want to
mount it we can get more creative with
it and the places we want to fit it
inside of our case especially mini ITX
or small form-factor users are not
always going to have as much clearance
as you otherwise would in the case such
as the h4 40 here
additionally the unit does come in a
kind of two-tone style it is half matte
and half glossy I'm not a huge fan of
the gloss but I'm okay with it being
half glossy especially since it's in
this case literally towards the back end
you can't really see it as much I'm not
a glossy fan whether it's you know the
bezel of a monitor the screen itself or
on any product that's meant to be
showcased I just think it looks a little
bit tacky but here they've actually
managed to pull it off and it looks
quite nice especially since this thing
is really going to shine during the
night time or when it's a dimly lit
environment and you're not going to have
too much glare or reflection on that
glossy surface anyway so it's not too
big of an issue I do think the unit
looks pretty stylish so I'm not going to
dock it for anything there I think it
looks good enough also you'll notice
that the white LED I've been talking
about now that's just to indicate that
it is in your case I shouldn't even say
that it's an indication it's a power LED
because this thing actually stays on
even when your system is completely
powered off I mean it'll even stay on
when you unplug the AC power cord from
the computer now I'm just kidding it
doesn't do that that would be terrifying
but yeah you can turn the system off
completely and the white LED stays on
which some people might not mind at all
some people might hate it so that's just
something to be aware of especially if
you're going to have it on display in
your side panel window coming bleeding
through your side panel window as is the
case right here now what I thought was
really odd and kind of interesting and a
little bit disappointing quite frankly
is that you can't actually turn the LED
off at all whether it's you know a
switch on the back or something or
you're within the software it just has
to stay on but even more than that is
that you can't change the color of it
it's just fixed at in that white color
so I thought that was kind of a
disappointment just because this is
really a product that revolves around
tailoring the look and the customized
feel of your system and I just felt
since you can do all these fancy things
with the LED strips themselves in terms
of you know LED effects and whatnot I
thought you know it would just make
sense for you to be able to customize
the white LED there but unfortunately
that's not the case hopefully again in a
two or three point Oh model that later
down the line we see some adjustability
for that now on the back of the unit
itself you do get a few ports including
a DC power port that does connect to a
molex power cable from your power supply
they do give you they do include all of
the necessary plugs and cables to get
this thing up and working you know to
power it on that comes with a DC to
molex adapter it is 5 volts you just
plug it in you're pretty much ready to
go it also has a mini USB ports that
connects leads to your motherboard a USB
2.0 port on your motherboard and that's
just to allow it to communicate with the
cam software which is NZXT s in-house
software that controls this whole system
and then finally on the back of the unit
you get to channel ports
each of these channels are capable of
hosting up to 4 LED strips giving you
support for a total of 8 LED strips
altogether why don't we talk about the
LED strips themselves because there's
been a lot of questions in regards to
how they mount to the case and things
like that these ones in particular they
are magnetic and adhesive they are both
so you get the three 3m backing adhesive
that you can peel off and stick it
pretty much to any case regardless of
the material and then you also got built
you also have built in magnets for steel
cases obviously this isn't going to work
on aluminum but about the magnets
I think the the magnets are a bit weak
they're on the weaker side they do work
they are functional but something is a
slight as the weight or the angle of the
channel connector that the LED strip
actually connects to that can drag the
the magnet away from the case it can
pull the strip down even the connectors
themselves for the LED strips I wish
there was a magnet inside of those it's
kind of just hanging there unless you
have some way to adhere it to the side
panel or the back of your case or the
front of your case wherever you're
mounting it BitFenix does this really
well they have built-in magnets into
their alchemy 2.0 strips their magnetic
line of LED strips which works out
beautifully and I think NZXT could take
a page out of the bit phoenixes book in
terms of just finding a way to secure
these these cables down a bit more so
that that would be my one critique
there but that's pretty much all I have
to say about the LED strips again we're
going to talk about how they look later
on so now let's make our way over to the
NZXT cam software which is really the
driving force or the beating heart of
this device and what really makes it
tick so here it is right here this
window above my head the first thing I
noticed is that is that the window
itself is not resizable it's pretty much
at this fixed size which i think is
really annoying because there's a lot of
information here a lot of good
information you know especially when
you're trying to configure your LEDs I
keep having to like scroll up and down
to you know look at certain settings or
just certain things and it would have
just been easier if they'd allow you to
just stretch out the window just down a
couple just a few pixels more and it
would have been ace but unfortunately
that's not the case that being said
there are certain things about this
software that I do like it is very
functional it's smooth it does lag every
now and then when you're just when
you're adjusting certain settings for
example when you hit Save Changes
sometimes the the button doesn't turn
gray right away making you think that
you haven't actually clicked it nor does
the color picker always now of course
now that everyone's watching it is
completely flawless and there's no lag
whatsoever but I did experience a little
bit of slowdown from time to time when I
first started using it nothing
detrimental though so that's good now
let's take a look at the first kind of
the homepage of the the cam software if
you will this is kind of just a
comprehensive at a glance look for your
system stats things like your CPU and
GPU temps and load percentages and you
can also have you also have an advanced
menu here where you can look at your CPU
each core individually if you want and
it gives you mins and Max temperatures
which is nice GPU same deal and you get
motherboard Ram hard drive I'm not going
to go into all this stuff because it's
really not the bread and butter of the
software but it is something to be aware
of it is a nice feature and you can even
pop out this window which is much better
I like this much better because you can
actually extend it well I'm my face my
my body and face are blocking it but you
can kind of I didn't really plan this
out well did I but look you've got all
these different stats this is
much more akin to Hardware monitor
because you can resize it even the
layout is very similar I also really
like that there's a reset stats button
that's very crucial for me when I'm
benchmarking is to be able to just leave
the software open and just reset the
stats anytime I run a new benchmark
instead of having to close it out and
open it again gets really annoying and
frustrating so this actually makes it a
very viable solution or alternative I
should say to something like hardware
monitor especially because as we're
going to take a look at later you can
actually sync the led colors to the GPU
or CPU temperatures in your chassis so
because of that you are going to
sometimes need want to look at you know
the temperatures of your particular
components so it's a good thing that
they've made it easy here for someone
who might not be running hardware
monitor or you know who doesn't know
about it so everything is already here
you don't have to go ahead and download
a new monitoring app if you're gonna be
taking advantage of those led effects
moving on
you've got specs here in case you forgot
what your system was built with I guess
you know just gives you a look at that
why not they've included it there for
you
also some advanced information here
again more nitty-gritty details I mean
tells you the max TDP of your video card
so yeah you get specs specs specs are
good now moving on to the FPS tab over
here you do get a bunch of overlay
settings to choose from this is very
similar to MSI Afterburner for those of
you who are familiar with it
it just displays a bunch of different
information in the corner of your screen
while you're either gaming or
benchmarking so you do have FPS things
like average FPS CPU and GPU temps your
memory usage very useful information
here and you can also change the font
color depending on the scene or the
background of what you're going to be
testing or gaming on just to make sure
that it's legible and visible you can
also change the font you can also change
the overlay position to different
corners of the screen let me change this
to something a little bit more visible
so you can kind of see it move around so
this is also great if you've got a
particular game where there's a HUD or
there's a mini-map in the corner of your
screen it's always in the bottom right
so obviously you want to switch it up so
that it's not covering there's no
interference there also get some
shortcut keys which you can change just
to toggle the overlay on and off
which is very handy indeed all right
folks now this is where things get all
fun and colorful and stuff because we're
finally going to take a look at how each
of these LED strips can be configured in
terms of the different lighting effects
that they're able to achieve inside of
the can of software so taking a look
right here under our hue tab you can see
we've got our two channels which are
each again capable of hosting up to four
LED strips and as I mentioned before
I've got two of them I've got three
connected in the system total two of
which are on channel one and then I've
got a third one on channel two so
basically the check boxes allow you to
edit that particular channel of LED
strips so if you have one of them
selected then any kind of changes you
make under the the color wheel or under
the fixed presets here are going to be
applied to that channel only if you
check both channels then anything that
you change down here is going to be
applied to both of them so you don't
actually have to duplicate manually just
takes care of it automatically which is
nice so I'm just going to be doing I'm
going to check both channels just to
make things simple let's go ahead and
take a look at our preset so these are
all the different presets that you're
able to configure in the software
starting with fixed which is pretty
self-explanatory you can see I've got a
fixed color right here which is blue now
forgive the different color temperature
of the camera it does look a bit purple
here on OBS but rest assured I can tell
you right now I'm looking at with my own
eyes it is very blue and in fact the
color picker here in the software is
very true to what the LED color displays
which is something that I very much
appreciate because I've dealt with a lot
of different software and other LED
products where you know you go in the
color picker like I want this shade of
red and then it's like it's like a
hideous orange or like what that's not
that's not the color I picked at all you
don't get that so much at all
with this device I'm sure you could find
a few geez motorcycle I'm sure you could
find a few colors in there
of course it's probably not perfect
where you know it doesn't really match
quite as nicely but for the most part I
didn't run into too many issues on that
front now moving on to our breathing
effect still nothing earth-shattering
here we're all pretty familiar with this
this look so again it just you pick a
color and all of a sudden it kind of
dims in and out from going all the way
black to the brightest setting of a
particular color now you can adjust the
speed of this I'm going to go ahead you
can go from right now was on normal so
you can go from slowest to slow normal
faster fastest let's do it at its
fastest speed all right so that's about
as fast as you can go now obviously
there's not as much granular control
here as in something like the k70 RGB
software right you can't make it go at
pretty much any speed you want in terms
of like the exact millisecond it is it
is a lot of it's as pre fixed but that's
okay because I still feel like there's
enough customizability here to feel like
you're not too limited so I'm happy with
this so far also a really cool thing
that you can do with breathing is add
another color look at that
add another color here let's go with a
red boom Save Changes so now it kind of
breathes between those two colors but
wait you can add a third color whoa
and a fourth this is getting crazy what
my acting is on point today by the way
so look you've got all these different
colors that you can add I actually
haven't even tested how many colors you
can do is it is it eight I think it's
eight yes you can do up to eight
different colors which is enough for me
and then let's go ahead and save changes
whoa I had to go ahead and cycle through
all those first before it went went
through it and applied the the effect
but there you go now it's going to cycle
through all eight custom colors that I
selected and NZXT sexually made this
pretty easy for you to switch around
let's say you want to keep the the
selected eight colors that you have but
you want to change the order of them you
can just go ahead let's say I want the
red to go at the bottom you've got these
little up-and-down arrows which you can
just go ahead and click and easily move
that color to the eighth spot and then
just go ahead and update the changes and
you'll see that the eighth color will be
red this time around
obviously it switches place with the
other LED and that's pretty much it for
breathing let's move on to fading fading
same deal kind of like breathing except
instead of going from super bright to
all the way black and then to a
different color entirely it just kind of
transitions it does a cross dissolve if
you will
editor's will know this term between the
different colors so I've got our red
green and blue here what better colors
than RGB we're going to go ahead and I'm
just going to make this on fast because
I feel like that just allows you to see
the effect happen a bit quicker the
thing I want to say about performance is
that these LEDs are good they are very
saturated they give off a really rich
color and very accurate color as I was
saying you pretty much pick anything
from the color spectrum and you're good
to go
in terms of accuracy the one shortcoming
that I would say that I found in this in
these LED strips is that they could be a
bit brighter and the reason why I say
that is because even with these three
strips I feel like it's just bright
enough I would have to add a fourth or
maybe even a fifth LED strip to feel
like it was really bright and intense
like the BitFenix strips I will say are
brighter than these ones or at least
they seem that way and okay Kyle well
you can actually install up to eight LED
strips so why does that matter well it
matters because first off you have to
buy more LED strips it's going to cost
you more money to get that that level of
brightness that you want and also not
every case is going to be able to house
up to eight LED strips you might be
dealing with a smaller form factor case
or even this mid Tower which can only
really fit three of them comfortably and
then you're kind of limited in terms of
brightness on that and so there is no
brightness adjustment inside of the
software this is especially important if
you're dealing with a side panel window
that's tinted for example you might want
to have a brighter LED be cut to make up
for that tint on your side panel window
so I'm just looking at for everyone just
just so you know again it's not a deal
breaker I wouldn't say that they're too
dim I just I'm saying that it would have
been a plus had they made them a little
bit brighter that's that's pretty much
how I feel about that but that's not to
say that they are not super rich and
saturated and they do have a beautiful
color to them I just would have liked to
see a bit more intensity overall moving
on to the marquee effect this is again I
have to delete some of these profiles
I also wish that it was easier to delete
whole profiles at once because you can
see here I've got to delete each of them
one at a time it would be great if you
could drop down and then like check
check check you know and then you know
group delete all of them or however many
you need instead of doing it one by one
a little side note there so I'm dealing
with this custom profile marquee is
essentially a the marquee effect it
gives you a backlight color to choose
from so I'm going to go ahead and save
this one so you can see here I've got
this teal color as my backlight color
which is a fixed color that just stays
on all the time and then you've got your
marquee color which essentially is the
traveling color it's the LED that
travels across your strips and it kind
of gives a moving or motion effect as
you can see here from the image now I've
got hot pink or magenta going across the
teal backlight and you can go ahead and
switch this up if you want comet
I'm not sure exactly what comet does I
think comet just makes it a bit more oh
it makes it more like Tralee and so see
how there's a bit of hardness with the
magenta as it passes by there's not much
fading I should say the comment gives
you a bit more of a fade as it goes
across the the backlight which i think
is a nice effect you can also change the
LED group size I've got it maxed out
right now to 10 so 10 magenta LEDs pass
at a time so that kind of gives you a
longer comet if you will or a longer
trail you can reduce that all the way
down to two and you can see here it's
very minimal now it's a very small
little dinky marquee color that's going
across and you can also again change the
desired level of speed now I will say
that when you go when you go below
slower than normal let's say you're on
slow or slowest setting in terms of
speed it does start to look a bit choppy
because you can actually see the LEDs
switching colors as you can see here it
kind of gives a more flickering effect
it doesn't look as smooth for certain
for certain LED effects with the fading
in the breathing that's the slow the
slowness is perfectly fine it's smooth
and it transitions from color to color
just fine but when it comes to the more
key setting it can look a little bit
choppy just depending on your preference
it's good to note but there you go
now wouldn't it be nice if you could
actually add more colors to the SmartKey
effect well yes you can
speaking of which the covering or key
effect allows you to do that so we've
got two two of them here by default to
blue and green you can add another one
simply by clicking it just like we did
with the with the fading effect I'm just
going to do six colors here by the way
to change a color you simply click on
the slot that you want and then click on
a color you want alright so I'm going to
go ahead and save changes and let's see
what happens here again it's just like
the marquee tool or the marquee tool
thing in Photoshop here it's just like
the marquee effect except it gives you
more colors it gives you more
flexibility but how many colors you can
include again you still get speed
adjustment and direction I forgot to
mention direction you do get direction
with marquee as well so you can go
forward or backwards you can see right
now it's going forwards the LED tracing
is going in one direction now I can go
ahead and select backwards and then all
of a sudden the lights are going in the
opposite direction so you can really get
pretty detailed with what you want here
but that's pretty much going to cover it
for the covering marquee effect there's
not too much else to say about that oh
also I did want to point out I don't
even see this or I didn't even remember
to talk about this but you do get the
RGB code and hexadecimal code option if
you know exactly the hexadecimal you
know code that you want to put in it's a
six digit code that corresponds to a
particular color and for that you know
the one I just typed in is this ugly
blackish red which no one would ever use
but if you know your hexadecimal code
you can just punch it in or if you know
the RGB the three numeric value code
that's just an easy way to fully
customize the look of your of your kit
here now moving on to the pulse effect
this is very similar to the breathing
effect in that it you know fades to
black but instead of fading back up to
the next color it actually just jumps
off jumps back on instantly like a pulse
for example so it's a bit more jarring
it looks a bit more aggressive if you
will but there it is you can also add
additional colors right now I've got
just white enabled I'm going to go ahead
and add in a purple some blue
and a green and a yellow and Save
Changes now you can see pretty much like
the breathing effect but a bit more of
an abrupt transition to the next color
it just cycles through those four colors
I kind of picked Easter colors that's
kind of funny and again you can adjust
the speed here as well
we'll go fastest that's the fastest you
can make it
voila pulse pulse everyone moving onto
the spectrum effect this is probably one
of the coolest LED effects that you can
make with this device in my opinion it's
very similar to the covering Marquis
effect in fact you can actually
replicate this I'm pretty sure with the
with the covering Marquis effect except
the spectrum wave effect just already
includes every or you know allegedly
every color on the spectrum with with
the effect so it's it's just a wave it
goes through cycles through all the
colors it's really smooth the transition
is just beautiful it is much nicer
looking in person than the video does it
justice it's just a really beautiful
effect obviously again with the spectrum
wave effect there is no tuning to be
done it just kind of takes care of
itself
but if you want to do that you just want
to rainbow everything out you got your
you know your Corsair RGB keyboard
that's all rainbow effect rainbow wave
doubt and now you can have your system
do the same thing with with the software
here lastly you've got alternating this
is the last preset that we're going to
go over and it's it's pretty
self-explanatory again you can alternate
between two different colors just like
that you can change the LED group size
let's go to 10 and you can see it's a
bit more flashy oh this gives me an idea
bad boys bad boys what you're gonna do
what you're gonna do when they come for
you
bad boys bad boys get it it's like a
siren
I don't know I'm done I've been alone
for too long in this room so that's
pretty much all I have to say about
those presets so now we're going to take
a look at our smart LED effects now as I
mentioned earlier in the video you can
actually synchronize the color of your
LED strips to a given temperature
threshold of your CPU or your GPU you
can even change the LED color based on
your fps but unfortunately I was unable
to get that to work with the only game I
have installed on this system which is
rock
League but I'm sure it works just the
same I have tested both the CPU and GPU
temperature modes and they work
perfectly well they do function exactly
the same though so I'm only going to
show you the GPU temperature one you can
see right here you've got these
temperature zone colors so you've got a
corresponding color for every
temperature threshold for the GPU here
so the cooler it gets the the bluer the
the LEDs groups LED strips the Streep's
strips get and then the wor work the the
chip gets the redder or hotter the LED
color and of course you can adjust all
of this you know you can make it turn
green if it's if it's super cool or
whatever what have you actually if you
see right now you can see that the the
LED color is a bit more on the purpley
magenta side which means we're residing
right about you know anywhere from 50 to
60 obviously we're not at 70 degrees yet
but right here it says we're at 58 and
that's right about where we see
ourselves on this color zone but we're
going to go ahead and fire up Unigine
Heaven 4.0 and see if we can put a load
on it and then we're just going to see
if the LEDs do in fact change color as
the temperature of the chip inside of
this 390x warms up to that threshold
let's go ahead and see it looks like it
already changed so we're fast
approaching 70 degrees Celsius so close
in fact that we are seeing a very red
hue now with the LED strip so that's
basically how that whole ordeal works um
I was a bit I mean I guess there could
have been more smoothness in the
transitioning of colors it kind of just
seems like it just hops from one color
to the next as soon as it hits that
temperature threshold in my head I was
kind of expecting the colors to
seamlessly transition from one to
another very much like the very much
like the fading effect that we saw
earlier but instead it kind of just you
know abruptly changes to the next color
which doesn't look as cool in my opinion
but it does offer a nice at-a-glance
indication of how hot your systems
running so very cool effect nonetheless
and I think that's pretty much all I
have to say about the smart custom
profiles now moving on to the custom tab
here this is where things can get really
custom what you can do here under
this tab is you can adjust each
individual led and make them whatever
color you damn well please
so for example you can change each one
one by one let's say you know you want
your first LED on each strip to be red
you want the second one to be purple and
then the third LED to be blue now you
notice that when I click on one LED from
channel one it automatically selects the
corresponding LED from channel two to
strip as well however it does not select
the corresponding LED on the second
strip and channel one so you have to do
that manually by holding ctrl and
selecting it just like that and then you
can go ahead and make the adjustment to
all those LEDs which I mean is a bit of
an inconvenience but it's it's it's
nothing too horrible I suppose so let me
just go ahead and finish changing the
colors so I'm on the fixed mode right
now I'm going to go ahead and save
changes and now you can see my crazy
ugly effed up color scheme that I've
just implemented into the chassis looks
very horrible and hideous you can also
do a breathing effect so I'm going to
just leave these same LED colors here
breathing effect Save Changes and that
basically just does the same thing
except it breeds now and you can change
the speed although it doesn't allow you
to go very fast you can only go slowest
slow or normal it's already pretty slow
on normal so I'm curious as to why they
didn't allow you to go any faster than
that but you do get pretty much
uncompromised customizability and
flexibility here in terms of what colors
you can you can paint your system with
this effect and finally our last LED
effect tab that we have here is audio
now you can see it says it's in beta so
I'm not going to knock it for not
functioning all that well because it
doesn't it's really probably my least
favorite feature as it stands right now
now that's not to say that with a patch
update they could fix some of the issues
but what I found is that it just doesn't
work as seamlessly as I would like it to
by the way I should probably explain
what this is it synchronizes the LED
colors and the pulse of your LED strips
with music or audio coming from your
your desktop environment so if your
watching a YouTube video or you're
playing music from Spotify you can sync
it up and kind of give like an EQ effect
if you will however in the beta as it
stands it does not give off that EQ that
really cool EQ vibe where things are you
know going perfectly in sync with the
music it just seems kind of weak and I
do have some b-roll shots that'll
overlay so you can get an example of
that but you probably also want to hear
the audio that was overlaid while while
that LED effect was going on so I'm
going to shut up for a second you can go
ahead and check it out and have a listen
to see what it how it performs
so yeah it's not the best it's it's not
quite as tight as I would like it to be
nor is it as precise or accurate again
I'm not going to knock them for it
because it's in beta but I really hope
that they do fix that because that's one
thing that I still feel hasn't been
perfected when it comes to LEDs inch a
C's is being able to sync it very
fluidly with your with your desktop
audio which if it the day that it
actually works perfectly it's going to
be great because I think that's a really
cool effect that again hasn't been
mastered yet but I think those are all
the things did I want to say anything
about the settings um no these are just
you know email password settings and
things like that that's pretty much all
guys I think that concludes this video
what are my overall thoughts on the hue
plus I should probably sum up with the
conclusion instead of just closing up
the video this is by far not a perfect
product I pointed out a lot of things
here today that might make it seem at
first that I'm not thoroughly impressed
by it but don't let that fool you
because even though it's not perfect I
am it kind of in love with this thing
because it's just it's really what I've
been looking for in terms of LED
functionality for a system where I don't
have to take out or rip out the existing
LEDs granted yes you do have magnetic
strips now from BitFenix that doesn't
get adhesive mess all over the place and
can be easily reusable but you're still
limited to that single color that single
color of that strip which is just
incredibly limiting and and it's just
fixed as well it's just a fixed boring
single color I shouldn't say it's boring
it's just them it's just limiting and
now with with this product with this
device you can do a lot more and spend
spend a lot of time really tweaking and
kind of tuning the look and feel of your
system just really gives you a lot of
flexibility in terms of customization
which I very much appreciate and I would
recommend it apart from all its flaws I
think it's a good product
and I've definitely seen worse software
out there then then then NZXT scam but
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
now guys thank you all so much for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I will see you guys
in the next video
