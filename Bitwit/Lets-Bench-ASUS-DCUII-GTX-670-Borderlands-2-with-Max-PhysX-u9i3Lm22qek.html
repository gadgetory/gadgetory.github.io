slaughterhouse in Borderlands 2 and
today I'll be benchmarking the asus
directs you to gtx 670 I benchmark this
card not too long ago with left 4 dead 2
you can check that out if you missed it
but this is a more updated benchmark if
you will because it's Borderlands 2 it's
more recent game left 4 dead 2 is like
three years old but also because it's a
nvidia GPU I thought it'd be cool to
show off some of the physics effects
that are found so frequently in this
game and specifically because nvidia has
tailor-made their GP use to basically
kick the crap out of any physics effects
that you throw at it and it's just
optimized for physics so if you can see
here for example this we got a little
damage cloth here and if I shoot it it
actually reacts like totally flipped up
and fell back on that bar on that
railing and it's just very responsive
and the details just incredible and if
you have physics completely off you'll
be lucky if you even get this cloth here
sometimes a cloth will just disappear or
other times it'll just look like a piece
of cardboard and when you shoot it it's
like shooting a wall it doesn't react at
all so today I'm going to be
benchmarking this game with this card
with physics on high and also i just
downloaded the most recent beta driver
from geforce calm you guys have an
nvidia card i suggest you do it it's a
310 dot 33 i believe and i we actually
Paul actually talks about it in our
latest yoked episode on our newegg
channel so if you haven't seen that
check that out as well but yeah join me
along for this benchmark and should be
fun ok I'm willingly going into a
slaughterhouse call me crazy but I'm
doing it ooh this is a big clock let's
try the physics on this oh look at that
you should rip right through it that's
cool slaughterhouse now bitches
yeah okay grace tonight no wasting ammo
Kyle we're in an economic crisis you
should be more resourceful your
ammunition okay oh here we go looks like
I'm doing some kind of arena challenge
oh yes I remember doing this one Rachel
not too long ago and we meant to post
that except footage was scrapped because
audio was totally off the game audio was
louder than my beautiful voice and I
felt it wasn't worth while to be posting
but now you can see it this time just me
unfortunately Rachel's not here but
hopefully it'll still be fun oh and by
the way i am totally overkill for this i
think they're these guys are like level
20 something and yeah 23 and as you can
see i'm 33 and i'm really not doing this
as a let's play I'm really just trying
to show you guys the physics effects so
see how that guy exploded you can see
kind of like the particle effects look
really sweet you get all this delicious
green goop that flies everywhere that is
completely non-existent when physics is
turned off you don't get any green goop
if you want your green goop got turn fit
examples and there's a lot of debate
people are saying the straggler a lot of
people are saying now you can't use
physics with an AMD card really use it
with a nvidia card which is kind of true
because you can still have physics
enabled with an AMD GPU except since
some physics is kind of like an nvidia
inspired feature you're going to be
offsetting some of that processing to
your cpu with an EMV card so you're
actually not going to be you know using
your GPU to to give you those physics
effects you're going to be reliant on
your cpu which obviously is not going to
produce as beautiful results as in video
2 video or any graphics card for that
matter so yes you can you can use
physics turn it on with an AMD GPU
except you will suffer a performance it
especially if you're doing like a lot of
graphic intensive scenes in a game like
if it's boss battle and there's a
million guys coming at you and there's
bullets everywhere a lot of particle
effects
you will see a huge performance it
because your cpu's not gonna be able to
handle it as effectively so just bear
that in mind all right you come the big
guns all right I'm ready for you Wow one
hit KO I am totally Opie for this
oh hey hey there
right in the hole didn't mean to do that
but it looked kind of cool
hello should be there should be some
cool particle effects here oh god oh god
I was kind of cool see all the fragments
all over the floor these little shards
that's also physics you're not going to
see as much of that with it disabled
blood to a lot of like a lot more blood
comes out of your enemies when physics
is on high
you
alright so that was round one and
hopefully you guys could see the
awesomeness that is the physics effects
and yeah it's pretty badass right let me
know what you guys think but until next
time here your benchmarks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
