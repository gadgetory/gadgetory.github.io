all the free and hopefully audio sounds
good to all the frame up in their new
mix alright so that was the first time
we have set up like any sort of new
audio solution in there just like ins
tested it and it was just fine oh yeah
right yeah most of the time there's a
lot of chaos it's why I never
troubleshoot something new pointless
it's great it's a great way to do things
never tested it alright I believe we are
alive live to both YouTube and twitch
hello everyone welcome to awesome
Hardware episode 173 this is side B and

hard-hard where to catch the first half
of the show we stream every single
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time right
here on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
and of course as I just mentioned we
stream each half of the show to our
respective YouTube channels also if
you're just joining us or maybe you are
already on site a you maybe happen to
donate something in super chat will be
reading the messages that you've

he is an awesome guy and he actually
makes really really high-quality merch
so if you guys are interested at all in
any of the items that you see on my
store bit with tech or Paul store Paul's

get some awesome deals for either of our
stores 10% off all orders over 50 bucks
and 20% off all orders if you spend a
hundred by end of the show yes indeed
all right oh there's one more
announcement
that I'd like to make if I may be so
bold so wifey sauce and I recently
bought a house so congratulations thank
you and some people in the comments were
suggesting that I tweet up the property
brothers who have a very popular reality
TV show on HGTV highly successful and
just you know whatever just give it a
world nothing to lose there so I tweeted
at them I said hey property brothers
want to make a pit stop in LA this could
be magical property brothers
hashtag property brothers YouTube
edition I think it'd be cool I think it
would as gamers Nexus commented on my
tweet it would definitely expand their
audience
and also I think would be really good
for some tech representation to a
mainstream audience on television if
they're in Vegas right now but they are
in Vegas right now but you never know
miracles
you know what's crazy have happened so
we're not too far from Vegas if you guys
would like to I don't know maybe jump on
this bandwagon and help me tweet this
out to them you can just find them on
Twitter and also paste a link to to to
the tweet that I sent them as well
because that would be freaking good I
mean that would be my life first right
here my wife is a vegan I post videos of
computer stuff on the Internet everybody
does three point five million dollars
comedy if only if only that were the
case that's a it's a it's a funny meme
about that all the reality shows the
house hunting shows and the house
upgrade shows all right oh is that what
they're referencing yes like the
upgrades was like there's no way because
they were in every show they introduced
the couple and they're nice or whatever
and then they eventually get to the
point where like you know she you know
makes arts and crafts that have leaves
she finds on the ground did I you know
I'm on it
I write and I write poetry and I know
whatever our budget is five million a
budget four million dollar whatever I
have to be honest I haven't really
watched any of those shows maybe I've
caught one or two with wifey sauce in
the last year do you mean they're your
favorite shows you watch them all the
time probably those religious fan
through and through but actually wifey
sauce really does like them okay and
thinks the things that kind of things
are kind of hot so I really wouldn't be
disappointed we do too now they don't
reach out to me anyway if you guys want
to tweet at them
for fun go for it let's move on to some
tech news however we have a lot to talk
about today
intel has their 28 core xeon processor
the w3 175 x that's just been listed
online for four thousand great British
pounds I can't really figure out what
that is in USD probably something like
five thousand dollars maybe I don't know
this articles from over Clark 3d and a
lot of these a lot of this information
was unveiled last week at their fall
desktop launch event 1066 dollars okay
six cents right now I was right on the
money
quite literally yeah just over 5k
probably would be probably sell for an
even flat 5k here in the here in the
States that's reasonable I'm so unlocked
first of all we're talking about an
unlocked overclockable 28 core Xeon
processor this is kind of a first of its
kind in a lot of in a lot of ways six
channel ddr4 memory support that's
pretty badass you also have a dual-core
boost of up to four point three
gigahertz out of the box
not too shabby 225 watt TDP rest assured
you're gonna need at least you know
probably 240 preferably a 280 or three
sixty millimeter rad on there at least
also consider that intel has been very
cagey about their TDP ratings for
processors they true the TDP listed is
is not like the TDP running all cores at
the top frequency that they list right
so there is that very conservative
estimate for sure and then they've also
got ECC memory support and a bunch of
other xeon class features on this chip
it does require motherboards that are
our server grade while at the same time
also supporting overclocking which
previously and they even again currently
there are many boards that do that so
Intel is actually partnered with
gigabyte and asus to create motherboards
that are qualified and ready for the job
of just handling you know things like
ECC memory but while still overclocking
like an enthusiast grade cpu you don't
have pictures of that was I supposed to
is it not on the article uh no you can
see some ridiculously right over
engineered motherboards though from Asus
like the one that we saw at the event
last
yeah I've posted that pictures of it
okay yeah if you can find it finally
those that I mean that's just gives you
an idea what kind of serious business
we're talking here
yeah that's not logged in so it won't
let me look at what did it have did it
have like four or five eight ten TPS
connectors it had dual 24 pin dual 24 I
think it had like six Oasis and the the
gigabyte that they were like okay
someone had like six EPS connectors
across the top sure so this thing I mean
these these boards are gonna be
absolutely insane you know if I mean
what do you think man if a CPU is $5,000
how much is the is a flagship and other
board for that gonna cost like maybe a
grand a to grant I don't know I'm trying
to balance my like appreciation that
Intel is actually doing this with how
absurdly impractical they're making the
product itself it feels to me a lot like
they're just trying to push back against
the areas they're just trying to push
back against AMD with the thread Ripper
stuff and thread repair for what it sort
of I mean it's very effective and it's
very cost effective but there's still
some advantages that Intel has bit or
something like this I mean it's it seems
a little bit more like on the like oh we
said we were gonna do this so we're
gonna do it but prices are ridiculous
and like who knows how many of these are
actually even gonna be available for
sale but before the year ends right and
I was actually gonna buy this like this
is a niche within a neat yeah it's so
yeah that's the board this is the ACS
board it's about the Dominus extreme so
dual 24 pins on this side yeah so six
EPS are actually two of these are six
pins so those are like let's probably
pay wired as paid connectors right and
then for eight pins along there and
they've got like three or four fans
going across the VRMs up there yeah as
well as the fanned out here and the
chipset yeah the socket is LGA 3647
looks like thread your Brahma which is
yeah server socket that's very large
I've also heard not the easiest socket
to install onto
huh if you're talking about a home user
and then this is the gigabyte board that
we saw copy Tex
there look that that was going yes this
one maybe not finished yeah this one
seems a little bit more engineering
sample II I guess and also there's no
heat sinks on anything you're naked PCIe
slots Jesus yeah that's crazy so yeah
these boards are insane and as you can
see six channel memory you've got twelve
DIMM slots on each of these boards
absolutely ridiculous
interestingly enough these chips are not
going to be featuring solder Tim like a
lot of their other counterparts it's
still gonna be polymer based thermal
paste as existing Zeon's news so you can
expect some dealers from these as well
if you're trying to get paid for massoud
of them for sure like when our designs a
deleting kit for this how many of them
like it'll be the equal amount to how
many units are sold yeah privacy hughes
is that anyone that's gonna name four or
five thousand on this would would not
not delete it i me a truffle
keep an eye on those long enough so did
we didn't say thank you to John by the
way Knutson that's a that's a sidetrack
I did say that he'd give us these beers
and thing he did agree for it thank you
thank you thank you again John he sent
us not just the beer here's the last
nation brewing yeah this is the mosaic
IPA I'm drinking the IPA it's good for
you no no no and then you're did the I
all have one of the ghosts yeah grab the
have a ghost is it a ghost no it's a the
river or wait no what's it called ghost
go say oh you mean the actual name of it
it's the wind the wind yes but it's the
wind it's a ghost dry Hauser with Citra
hops and grapefruit it goes it goes it
is it goes oh yes Graham's with Rosa
okay
and if I say that as if like of course
Kyle that's because we looked it up
before the show that's fine I know how
to pronounced in educators of beers no
good alright well thank you John we
appreciate it and we got the shirt yeah
the popcorn everything is amazing you
are literally the best also truffles
he's been our he's been our our main man
for virgin dice for running on what
three years now or something like that
well for you he's awesome tonight
tonight oh yeah I guess I was with him
before you huh not too much longer but I
was trained to imply that like
then we've been doing much longer but oh
oh I didn't really make it
yeah that's not true anyway I don't know
I lose track of time
Oh dark raspberry is hazy
this must be unfiltered also credits if
you're gonna do a box of chocolates
especially if their chocolates filled
with something you know you're gonna you
should always have well know you should
know what you're gonna get because they
should include this yeah clearly put
your gum bought the cheap shit the chart
with all the chocolates so you come with
the tart
what the hell you're about to put in
your mouth stupid penny pincher you're
just gonna throw a random chocolate in
my mouth and be like oh I'm delighted
with the surprise of flavor now I need I
need to mentally prepare myself and then
will the chocolates actually be arranged
in this order of the chart so that it'll
be like a wonder one as soon as you lift
it up you I mean which one are you gonna
go for first I was looking at that dark
Irish cream mmm it's green yes there
they are a true mark of of luxury these
are some beautiful looking chocolate no
way there they look better in person
than in the pictures yeah I wonder how
far it could be help them for stabbing
up them without them all falling out
completely damaged I got this that's too
bad hey if I'm not spilling beer I'm
spilling chocolate something else oh man
this is a slightly easier to clean up
and they don't you know damage hardware
quite as easy Oh looks good
are you gonna have one no no no why not
cuz the because of sugar that I have no
self-control Paul meaning if I have one
I will eat half the box
I see it's either it's all or nothing
I'm like you have to treat me like an a
recovery you know victim like I can't
you shouldn't even be eating those in
front of me technically it's rude and
I'm offence to try to enable your you're
enabling me right now well I mean
they're very small I imagine just one of
them probably wouldn't even be that's
that's exactly what an addict would say
yeah shall we move on to our next story
Google Google Google Google what are you
doing Google Google and then Paul will
momentarily give us a full review on the
chocolate truffles but you can't until
we've watched it through the Google
thing
hexxus what's the context in talking
about marina so there's a hex article
it's really been all over the internet
this morning Microsoft you know as we
know has recently announced that they're
ditching the edge HTML rendering engine
to pretty much reinvent edge the browser
as we know it in place of a chromium
sort of open source code to improve the
user experience they're gonna use
chromium we're gonna use chromium sorry
the new version of edge will be based on
chromium yes yeah exactly
this is gonna be a chromium edge type of
experience and that will allow them to
do a bunch of cool things but Joshua
Paquita a former edge intern claims that
the move to a chromium to chromium edge
to chromium was was forced what was it
forced by forced by Microsoft themselves
and I'm sorry Google themselves
apparently according to him on a online
forum chrome app developers have
actually been sort of sabotaging
websites for lack of a better term so
that they don't run as effectively or
smoothly or as optimally for other
browsers it's kind of shady so at one
point edge was actually more power
efficient than chrome at at at
displaying YouTube pages it was actually
way way more efficient on YouTube then
then chrome was and then Google made a
change to YouTube's code with a hidden
empty div over YouTube videos that
caused edge to start performing worse so
it's a on that particular platform so if
paper tells um they should be right
there top shelf by the water-cooling
stuff usually when I need paper towels
the most when I'm water cooling so with
with edge and especially with with edge
sort of updating only biannually because
it's you know it's been attached at the
head set to Windows the operating system
all this time they really only fix this
issue with YouTube during the Windows 10
the wind 10 update in October so it you
know they're kind of tied down from from
that but with chromium edge
the new edge will be detached from
operating system and so they'll be able
to update more frequently what what did
you just do you have your piece of
chocolate and my beer it's fun that's
gonna enhance the flavor and your beard
maybe your shaved my beard counts I
can't bring it back no matter how much
you how many times you ask because you
can all you have to do is nothing
he literally has a couch Oh is the
easiest thing to bring back in the world
um so anyway it's a little bit sketchy
on on Google's part if this is true
again we're just trusting the word right
now we're only going on the word of some
random intern ex intern from the edge
development team but if it is true it's
a little bit concerning because you know
as much as you might be a fanboy of one
thing or another at the end of the day
competition is best and you you want
other browsers in this case to be viable
viable alternatives to even your
favorite browser so the fact that you
know Chrome or Google may well be
sabotaging Microsoft edge means that
they're really not you know like
sabotaging another browser like Firefox
for example isn't outside the realm of
possibility and Firefox is a really good
and still very popular and relevant
browser that a lot of people prefer I
know you use Firefox a lot Paul and I
even use it sometimes so I'm using
Firefox right now Kyle yes you yes you
are
damn it so you know hopefully your page
doesn't crash any second now nope that's
working just fine as google app devs are
definitely watching our stream and
paying close attention to the most
relevant tech show in the world um so
yeah you know this could also be an
episode of a segment of oh joy I suppose
but we'll keep a close eye on this
there's also Google and some of the
articles I've been reading about this
today there's there's concern that this
is seeding too much power over the
Internet in general to Google yeah whoo
Google already controls much that are
the internet and they're they're huge
when it comes to the direction it goes
when it comes to write you know back-end
development and stuff like that so not
only do they have
some of the most visited websites Google
the most popular search engine and
YouTube and everything but now we're
talking like the majority of browsers
are also going to be controlled by
Google and that they can just take
action in certain situations and people
will have no choice but to go along with
it and you just have to kind of hope
that Google does the right thing which
is often now you have to act like Google
I wish they still I wish they would
still push the don't be evil thing I
feel like you even if it wasn't true
just to just to just to make me feel
better stand still some false hope
that'll be nice sure all right next up
we've got an article from CNET about
apple lying apple has been lying eyes
iphone x resolution and other phones in
their lineup their new lineup there's a
lawsuit that's alleging two plaintiffs
have filed a lawsuit in the US District
Court of Northern America or sorry
Northern California in America alleging
that Apple falsely advertised the screen
sizes and pixel counts of the displays
on its iPhone X iPhone s XS and iPhone X
s max devices Apple didn't respond to
requests for comment from seen it of
course the suit alleges that Apple lied
about the screen sizes by including non
screen areas like the knotch and corners
saying that the new line of phones art
all scream as marketed your phone isn't
all screen it's not a fully bezel is all
screen design you've got a not you've
got other corners that aren't actually
accounting for other pixels that aren't
really displaying anything you take you
take the 24 36 by 11 25 resolution right
you're not getting all those pixels if
you just do length by width right you're
not you cut out any very this is totally
valid and even you know to to extend
that a bit if you're actually even
counting that the the physical pixels on
the phone not all of them are containing
a red green and blue sub pixel all right
some of the iPhone we are talking about
the iPhone according to the complaint
the iPhone X allegedly only has two sub
pixels per pixel
which isn't a pixel we're talking about
the iPhone no no no Paul Paul Paul I see
what you did there
you're sabotaging sabotaging the article
you're sabotaging the segment you're
trolling Paul be trolls trying to throw
a wrench you know they they see they see
me trollin and like a gesture they hate
me are you done yes I not again what is
it for support I know you don't want to
go and try out again it support joke
anyway let's move on you started it I
know the loss it did pretend it never
happened
the lawsuit also claims that the iPhone
8 plus which is a much older phone has a
higher quality screen than the iPhone X
I'm sure it's a lot more expensive as
well to buy an iPhone X that has an
inferior quality screen according to
these lawsuits so it's definitely been a
lawsuit riddled year for Apple this
isn't the first time that they've been
under heat in this sense in March of
earlier this year the company got sued
by dozens of customers over a software
tweak that throttled the iPhone battery
and things like that in June another
seat a suit was seeking five million
dollars in damages over Apple watch
screens having a tendency to crack
shatter or detach from the body of the
watch all of which seemed kind of
unfortunate if you're sending that much
money out of the single device I would
prefer that not happened to my watch no
definitely not
I wanted to shed her like a piece of
pirate lust they lost a fair amount of
market cap I believe as well yeah it
hasn't been the greatest year for Apple
they've had a lot of controversial
launches and definitely lawsuits up the
yin-yang so we fell saying how 2019
fares for them would you like to
continue talking about companies that
are doing well Paul
yeah they peaked in October at the share
price of 232 Wow and they really
plummeted almost to the point where they
were down to 163 now which is where they
were at the beginning of the year yeah
oh wow remember you did a story about
them reaching in the the total company
valuation over a trillion dollars right
now they're way down
none of the market caps down to 780 just
a paltry 788 billion
Jesus pathetic that's still nots but you
know this the sort of curve right here
is very similar to the next company
we're talking about as far as stock
markets are concerned okay that's a
great segue Oh beautiful maybe I was
even redeemed myself from the stupid
pixel joke as team by team playing gray
and and and and full-blown and
full-blown web Redemption
right here caught live detectives well
done Paul thank you so this article from
extreme tech talks about invidious stock
plunging you guys have probably heard a
lot about this their soccer in in
October was around two hundred and
ninety dollars now it's below one
hundred and fifty so they've they've
tanked over fifty percent which really
sucks for a lot of Nvidia investors why
why did they take so hard well in short
Nvidia fell short of the projections on
cryptocurrency field GPU demand based on
how the beginning of this year was going
where everyone liked the GPU mining
craze was just insane investors and and
even in video themselves we're
projecting that GPU sales around the
holiday season would be even crazier
than ever but as we all know the the
pricing the value of Bitcoin and theorem
I should say specifically GPU based
mining cryptocurrencies
have tanked hard and so the actual GPU
demand has fallen off tremendously so
that made its rebounded though it's
rebounded since your article for one
forty six forty five okay to 146
ninety-four okay they're on the
up-and-up now it's a total GameChanger
you gots a two point three four percent
today Kyle no geez Wow everyone sit back
everyone everyone so by your Nvidia
stuck now okay so now that now that
cryptocurrency is flopped Nvidia is
really stuck with a surplus of stock and
they announced that it would ship no
mid-range GPUs in q4 of this year in
order to clear inventory so stock takes
a massive beating because of that and
the numbers are pretty evident as well
so Softbank which is the fourth largest
investor of the company is rumored this
is all just speculations all hearsay is
rumored to sell some or all of its stake
in the company which would make them
some three billion dollars of profit on
the trade remains to be seen if that's
at all true it's also unclear how well
and how much Turing factors into all of
this and how well Turing GPUs have been
selling overall if you look at you know
just if you're just sort of like spot
pricing here Amazon and Newegg shows
that the r-tx 2070 has been selling the
most out of the Turing family but it's
still way behind the sales of other
mid-range GPUs like the GTX 1060 and
even the gtx 1070 what the article
speculating though is that you know even
though RT x hasn't been received with
open arms necessarily it's most likely
this the stock plummet is most likely
due to the cryptocurrency hangover that
we're currently experiencing and it also
mentions that you know stocks like these
are prone to fluctuate a bit all the
time but nvidia is still pretty
rock-solid in terms of the hardware and
the technology that they're bringing to
the table it's not like you know that
they really made any bad or you know
grossly you know misinformed decisions
or anything like that they still are
really solid from a fundamental hardware
level you you could accuse them of
betting over betting what level of
production they should have done for the
ten series during the cryptocurrency
mining crisis and definitely in fact
that they have so much inventory sitting
on shelves right now is part of that but
another thing another point they're sort
of an another way of looking at that I
was reading about was that their price
was pretty inflated for quite a while
because of cryptocurrency mining because
of the demand right GPUs and everything
so you could somewhat look at this as a
correction although it's a pretty
striking one because at the beginning of
the year they were at 196 so this is
still about 50 points down from that
right peak was 292 so damn there you go
cray cray
next up we've got an article from hexxus
once again about intel finally coming
out with some branding information on
its new discreet GPUs we're calling
these they're calling these the X or X
like where the e is like it's like x
squared but x squared power of X e to
the power of e that's how that's how the
brand name is pronounced as well the new
Intel ^ e graphics processors I will
never buy one of those
how they're actually gonna brand it
hopefully it's just called XE or yeah
hopefully it's just XE because I like to
get some explanation of how it's
supposed to be pronounced cuz that's a
stupid name why is the E in superscript
Y in it anyway it looks like the
Internet Explorer II that's true I hope
that's not the actual and why is the X
cracow the X obviously has a foundation
problem here with its with its left leg
dragging right up looks like it needs a
root canal G I want to call it as G she
she she she she she like a the internal
she I got Chinese carrot is that a
Chinese character she I'm sure she Jing
there's so many in huge any Chinese
characters changing her location
she Qing Feng okay she she what is this
miles probably so pretty but I'm making
fun of it yeah it's the poor guy
I just kidding laughs so I don't know
it's it's the XE I'm just gonna call it
XE for for now for the sake of
convenience the slides were showing that
the graphics will arrive by the Year
2040 um also notice that the the graph
that you were showing earlier the y-axis
and the actual performance curve looks a
bit underwhelming but hopefully that's
just not accurate at all because those
are just integrated graphics that it's
comparing it to it doesn't seem to be
tapering this curve yeah yeah which
which isn't great so hopefully that's
not accurate and given that there's
absolutely no numbers on either of the
access access except 2020 right here
right um that's really probably
shouldn't read too much into it
yeah so the there wasn't much else
information about this discrete GPU the
part that the XE line will be also will
be integrated into integrated graphics
as well so XE that technology whatever
technology is being harnessed their
weight we're going to integrate their
graphics into well the the whatever like
the actual technology or architecture is
going to be integrated in
you like it's kind of like Vega right
like you've got Vega Rx Vega desktop
GPUs but you've also got integrated Vega
graphics so it's gonna be that sort of
thing
so it will be a flexible scalable deep
graphics architecture exactly okay
yeah and then so there's a lot of
different there's sort of a spectrum of
performance possibilities here with XE
and they've also showed off their the
first sample of the Intel I don't know
no idea how to pronounce this full of
arrows for that well they had us oh yeah
what are you mark Super Mario looks at
AI it's little and Italian loads in
there this is the Intel they handles
Nvidia from a different route the air
the center syllable so the Intel for the
arrows 3d stack at the logic achiever
will be a new way of a building a
processor you know because of the
fragmenting of various elements so would
you take or you take a CPU you cut it
into a bunch of pieces and then you take
those pieces and you turn them into a
thin layers you're stuck at the lighting
or some type of each other is it am I
still Italian or have I migrated to a
completely different that's here other I
feel like I was your invitation of your
other Italian cousin dial him up man
really has no end so so basically
vamoose
I really can't say it any of those I
don't know you kind of it reminds me of
HBM where they're actually stacking
elements of memory chips they're laying
right on top of each other in a 3d
vertical format in order to save space
and that's kind of what Intel is doing
here but with the actual CPU makeup and
so you have different elements of a CPU
being layered on top of each other and
that's in in at the end of the day I
think the main goal of theirs with with
this whole initiative is to be able to
create full chips at 10 10 nanometers
scale because that's one of the biggest
challenges that Intel's been facing over
the last couple of years and so the
sample that they were showing off
measured just 12 nanometers but only one
millimeter thick even though it's a 3d
stack design so hopefully this will help
propel 10 nanometer into the mainstream
like big little it's like big little big
like arms big little there's a big CPU
core and then they're smaller what kind
of courses yeah there's atom course
there's a sunny Cove core and then
there's atom quarter eighty course
there's a hybrid x86 I love that design
atoms great it's interesting yeah all
right so that's cool if they're showing
up some sample they had a working sample
there as well they were testing out you
guys can investigate further if you like
but let's move under the beavers report
yeah things here before before we close
out this is an article from CNN and it's
about Alfonso Ribeiro suing fortnight or
Epic Games and in take-two Interactive's
somewhere over all the Carlton dance in
their game so I don't know if you guys
are familiar but Carlton is a character
from Fresh Prince of bel-air Fresh
Prince of bel-air which was a very very
popular 80's 90's TV show that I
actually grew up watching how about you
Paul oh yeah we would watch you would
get around the telly and watch this all
the time and this is a famous Emmy this
was he was just iconically known for
this dance which was typically performed
to the tune of Tom Jones's it's not
unusual so it's not unusual to be look
by anyone it was kind of swinging our
motion well that that our motion that
exact dance is now an emote within the
fortnight game and alfonso ribeiro which
is the actors name who played Carlton
infrareds bel-air who's also now the
current host of America's Funniest Home
Videos is now filing a lawsuit against
epic and take-two interactive software
incorporated saying that they have
unfairly profited from using his
likeness and from exploiting his
protective creative expression the
lawsuit asks the California federal
court to bar the game devs from using
selling or displaying the dance so it's
also called trash did you mention that
yes it's called for obvious of course
obvious ripoff it didn't even it's not
even called Carlton they don't even give
him that you know they had to they
abused Will Smith's wrapper to me Lee is
also suing yes two million also has a
dance in there and did you get to get
the backpack kid the OL floss backpack
kid has also joined the lawsuit backpack
kid yes so there's a lot of people
singing epic right now oh yeah for all
these emotes that they just kind of
snagged it's a little bit irresponsible
it's interesting to me like I wonder
what the courts gonna rule here because
Alfonso Roberto he's just an actor and I
feel like the Carlton dance he's only
famous for doing the Colton dance within
the franchise that is or the IP that his
Fresh Prince of bel-air does he actually
does the actor own that move is that
really is that hey he also went on
Dancing with the Stars did he do that
was that like did he do that move he
specifically did that move okay him one
of the dances so maybe me it's it's I
feel like it's a gray area it'll be
interesting to see where the court draws
the line when does a dance move for
something like that become yours if it
was initially something that you were
you know a role that you were hired to
do by a different company is that the
property I mean maybe they'll look into
the contracts that he signed with you
know Fresh Prince of ballet or the
production company they are to see if
you know this this extends to that the
interesting thing is that he's gone on
record in the past talking about it
because it's one of those things that
became kind of culturally significant
the Carlton dance became a thing and he
said that he copied it from Courtney Cox
Courtney Cox dancing specifically I
think to that song so I guess there is
some legal precedent precedent to this
going back like you can copyright a
dance routine like a choreographer would
be the artist of a new routine and you
would expect that given that artists
have some protection for their work that
somebody who created something like that
would have some legal standing when it
comes to you know if somebody else took
their work and did something whether it
also depends like how derivative it was
was a change was modified or did they
kind of copy and paste it right here
you're talking about something that's
historically not been meleave in past
lawsuits and this is just from some
articles I read on this earlier today
have ruled that short little dance moves
aren't protected by copyright in that
way so I was gonna say it seems like so
too insignificant or
not unique enough to be but I'd be
written in the past you could argue that
there really hasn't been a medium such
as a video game like fortnight I would
say truly like the prayer why I this
reminds me of like World of Warcraft
World of Warcraft has a bunch of dances
back in the day you can make your
character dance and they had some that
were taken from popular culture and
stuff like that but they had like like
the derf did like the Russian dance and
whatever so there's like traditional
dances like that so here you have the
ability that probably hasn't really been
existed in the past to take something
that was created a short little snippet
of a dance
sure digitally recreate it to package
that and then include it as part of a
product that's being sold very
successfully as for tonight is and so
naturally you have people who are like
and a lot of see these situations people
will see their content being used but
not necessarily profited from if
somebody takes your video or something
and they're like make something else and
like oh that's money whatever oh there
would be a particular and they're
selling it and they're making money off
of it right well then I think there's a
little bit more like of a standing for
that so the a totally different story of
fortnight wasn't it the number one game
in the world
yeah and then there's this there's some
gray area in between and everything
there's also the opposite side of it
which is like well apply this to like
YouTube or something like that YouTube
is post to an insane amount of
derivative works people who take other
people's works and like whether you're
talking about something like a reaction
video where they actually show it
directly and they're just sitting there
reacting to likes people trying to take
other people's dance routines and do
them themselves and post back to their
YouTube channel like it's a very
challenging to I feel like create a
legal framework that says here's where
you slice lies exactly well this is okay
right
and like on and then on this side it's
like exploitation and there and and then
the people should yeah so it's gonna
boil down to the judge at the end the
day however the judge sees it how they
perceive all this so let's see how it
goes and and my I mean my hope would be
that whatever they do decide doesn't
overflow to the point where it's too
restrictive to where people creating
derivative content from stuff like small
dances and everything like so you know
like the stuff we talk about in EU with
the the
you tube the the EU laws that are gonna
affect YouTube and stuff it's like you
know there needs to be some ability for
people to just make stuff up yeah but it
all comes down to profit are you making
money from something somebody else great
right like are they selling the fresh
emote are they selling the Carlton its
emote is that like something you can pay
extra for or have to pay extra for to
unlock you could argue that because in
fortnight I don't think you get the
dance moves right away that's a pretty
high end I haven't played it enough but
I believe right some people in Chad are
saying that those dance moves are for
sale yes so that's that's definitely
that definitely builds a case for mr.
Revere Ribeira so hope they get some of
that fortnight money I mean given how
successful fortnight has been if you
underst know its socialist nevermind
everyone gets the dollar then Tendo
switch you know switch thanks hot
hardware for this article basically a
very quick article saying that the
Nintendo switch has been crowned the
fastest selling game console for this
generation since its launch in March of
2017 the switch has sold more than eight
point seven units eight point seven
whoever got that 70% of a switch you
meant eight point seven million right
yes the article actually only it's a
typo in the art that is specifically a
type a time they're talking it the
author because it says eight point seven
unit so whoever that hardware with this
Paul I'll pick it up Paul come on Paul's
telling you Paul but you got to check
your work man so they probably meant
eight point seven million units that
seems to be more realistic somebody
didn't get one of the controllers was a
bootleg version so this console has
outpaced every other current gen console
in the United States during the same
point in their respective life cycles so
it's um it's the biggest just most
popular selling console for 2018 this
wins it beats out the Xbox one
whether you talk about the Xbox one ass
or X beats up the PlayStation 4 Pro and
so forth there's a quote here it's and
I'll just read it out we are thrilled to
see such reaction from the consumers in
the second holiday season for Nintendo's
switch that's from Nintendo of America's
senior VP Doug Bowser his last name is
Bowser it's spelled the same way have I
completely missed this am I just so out
of touch that I never realized that the
intent of America's senior VP's last
name is freaking Bowser what are that
frickin odds there's no way there's no
way that I've missed the thing that
makes me think this is all just a
simulation right yeah then this is this
is the actual game devs just hint this
is dropping little Easter eggs you know
this is like ready player one whoever
can find my little little Easter eggs to
that this is all really just a
simulation yep wins the grand prize and
I'll grant you real life in the real
world outside of this little virtual
life that you're in this is ridiculous
doesn't look like anything to be okay
Bernard spoilers so so the switch and
this is also kind of cool because you
know the switch isn't like the most
muscle doesn't have the most muscle out
of all the consoles it's it's weaker
from a horsepower sort of processing
power standpoint than the Xbox one X or
the PlayStation 4 Pro but it has a
really strong lineup of games and I
think that's what really makes a console
shine these days or any platform for
that matter PC is the lineup of games
that you that it offers so and Nintendo
switch oh my god it's had what Legend of
Zelda breath of the wild which was I
don't know if that won Game of the Year
last year but it certainly was a
runner-up at least and then we they also
have Super Mario Odyssey Mario Kart 8
deluxe and then just recently Super
Smash Brothers ultimate which has been
the fastest selling game on the Nintendo
switch in history selling three million
units in 11 days so there's there's just
all kinds of and I've played the game
competitively how many copies did you
buy I oh I bought three no I probably
bought one I've only bought one copy but
I haven't not been more obsessed with
any game in the last three years so
you've been playing a lot of Super Smash
Brothers I haven't been playing a lot of
it but I've been I've been playing as
much as I can because I just you know
obviously like when you do other things
you
I need to finish this other thing so I
can play more Super Smash Brothers it is
a good incentive and and the fact that
is that it the way that in ten dos which
is designed where I can just like undock
it so if like you know wifey sauce and I
have to drive to the new house and she's
driving I can just play it in the car
has been has been really nice never I've
never played mobile video games in the
car I'm prone to being too getting
carsick carsick though so I think that
would I won't get carsick just like a BK
me too
no only if I'm going up to Big Bear like
I'm a swarthy you know Road or something
like that but usually I can handle if
it's just like a straight line in the
freeway but that game oh my god
I love it maybe we can do some after
parties in the future with that game I'm
sure you're down Paul I'm down and then
we've got one more article here from MTO
news about rapper Soulja Boy potentially
facing mad jail time for selling bootleg
consoles really this is uh this is he's
a rapper and he used to be
I guess his thing isn't used to be
relevant really quickly follow tell me
is that a malwarebytes logo on his
forehead because it kind of looks like
this I mean it might be a wu-tang logo
looks but it looks like malwarebytes
just just for the first glance when I
first saw it I was like is the head of
malwarebytes for a debt-based at so it's
gonna it's gonna a be I could be I could
be totally wrong not look at this
there's an hour guys
it's an hour Beck's look and then
there's and there's Soulja Boy's
forehead I mean maybe a little fatter
it's a little fatter yeah when I looked
at I was literally comparing it
side-by-side I didn't pull up a logo I
just just thought yeah okay yeah like
someone in chat confirmed its its
wu-tang most likely which is what I
thought but being at the tech nerd I
that I am I initially saw malwarebytes
and now i cannot unsee so anyway this
dude is ridiculous um
Nintendo is threatening to press
criminal charges against this guy over
fake game consoles that he's selling on
his website these
consoles as you can see are completely
fake there they actually have bootlegged
roms Oh bootleg roms on them and the
actual you know they're not actually his
consoles he's just buying them from
China and branding them slapping a name
on slapping name on him basically it's
just om and they're total garbage
he's you can actually buy these on
Aliexpress Aliexpress whatever for a lot
cheaper than what he's selling them on
his site so don't you I don't care if
you're a fan of his do not buy these
they're just not legit they're not good
quality and you can even if you
absolutely have to buy it you can buy it
cheaper elsewhere so anyway he's just
being an idiot with how he's handling
all this this is um maybe a publicity
stunt you know maybe he's sick of being
irrelevant so you know the last people
the last time people talked about Soulja
Boy was in the you know 2007-2008 era
and now he's coming out with Superman I
like to call this shit for me I was in
bed but it could end up putting him in
prison according to the trailer this guy
goes full full of full-blown crank that
what do you call the rink that Soulja
Boy know what's the channel that
destroys everything oh oh destroyer and
jerry-rigged no no the one actual
physical destruction that's the channel
where they just take tech techrax
techrax oh I don't even know right oh
geez
oh wow ah just take it perhaps that
perhaps is the product that affords this
is his channel is this how all of the
reviews end no I don't I don't know what
this this is mad little pixel madla oh
yeah thousand subscribers who obviously
didn't think much of this no definitely
not
Wow hey I appreciate the I appreciate
the honesty yeah just just really paints
a picture it's just joy uh giving it the
old pentester so feel him feel been gay
all been test so according to the
trademark counterfeiting act
imprisonment for the first offense of
doing something like this what Soulja
Boy has done is at the 10 years and 20
years of imprisonment for repeat
offenders which a lot of people have
argued he has done he could be facing 20
years jail time or
or for selling these stupid bootleg
consoles with Nintendo roms on them
there's a Game Boy handheld device that
he began selling on his website that's
that's what initially caught Nintendo's
attention he's now selling a more
expensive console called the Soulja Boy
fuse or something like that that you
know he's saying was like six hundred
and fifty dollars but you can get it for
the low low price of for Honda
what what a deal and there's some these
and there's nobody sees this right okay
this is because it's an empty element
article right with it was it was hard to
find an actual like gamer based or
actual tech enthusiast focused publisher
for this article but I had heard it
passed around on the internet and I
thought it was worth talking about four
games report so don't buy anything from
soldier boy so but you see some geo mean
capsule from soldier boy it's a moral
the story it's not nothing too hard not
everyone it's not something you would
immediately think you should do but
that's hopefully it's a bad idea
yeah so that's all for my half y'all I
guess we can skip over to after party
but yeah but for now thank you very much
for watching and tousle on my video feel
free to do timestamps in the description
or in the comments i'll pinion and stuff
and if you want to find a link to the
after party it is in my description as
well
groobie we'll be right back guys see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
