the channel today we're taking a look at
this fantastic piece of innovation from
the folks over at Razer this is the
chroma bug holder and functionally at
its core pun intended for all your Razer
fans out there it is an RGB coaster and
don't let that fool you it is a
game-changer it's a groundbreaking piece
of innovation that will change your life
forever it changed mine I've only been
using it for a week and already my wife
loves me more cakes no longer have any
effect on my metabolism I found and you
know those little ingrown hairs that you
get sometimes when you're shaving I
don't get those anymore they just they
just stop coming in now I know you're
already drooling over this
groundbreaking technology but
unfortunately you might have a hard time
getting your hands on one of these these
aren't conventionally sold at trusted
retailers you're going to have to find
one on a reseller like eBay for example
and probably have to pay an absurd
amount of money to a scalper because
they're available in limited supplies
only there's only thirteen hundred and
thirty seven of these units available
worldwide and I was lucky enough to have
received unit number 499 out of a leaked
amount at the razor booth during CES
this year so I feel very privileged and
fortunate to be able to share this
unboxing experience with you guys today
so on that note you may continue fuming
with envy as I got over this product in
front of me all righty then let's go
ahead and crack this guy open all right
upon lifting the first flap looks like
we're greeted with this nice little
letter here from looks like it's from
min-liang tang himself the CEO and chief
gamer of razors not going to read the
whole thing but it says this
limited-edition Razer chroma mug holder
is our thanks for your tremendous
support for 2016 oh good I'm glad that
Razer acknowledges all the great things
that I've done for their company the
Razer chroma mug holder is also equipped
with Razer chroma lighting on the base
so looks like it can sync up perfectly
with all your other razor's chroma
enabled peripherals aha that's pretty
cool
what's intelligent detection the base
lights up when you place the mug on it
and keeps you hydrated by blinking green
according to an optimal drinking
schedule I have not witnessed the
blinking green cue myself but maybe we
can also give that a whirl later on
opening the second flap looks like we've
got a nice flat awesome nice foam here
very cushiony lots of foam protecting
the innards first thing we're going to
open up here is documentation pamphlets
because
we'll start with the least interesting
stuff first and work our way up to the
good stuff so we got some stickers Razer
stickers I always recommend placing
these on like street signs or other
places that could cause havoc we've also
got some documentation on how to use the
Razer chroma mug holder because it's
confusing and not straightforward at all
the system requirements welcome kick in
your system even run a coaster
we don't know let's let's see what it's
what it takes you need a PC with a free
USB port okay fair enough
windows 7 or higher you also need an
internet connection and 200 megabytes of
free hard disk space I would assume for
the software again keep the Razer chroma
mug holder away from liquid what how the
hell that's supposed to work maybe they
just mean like don't dip it in like a
pool do not take apart the Razer chroma
mug holders doing so will void your
warranty I didn't know this thing had a
warranty so that's kind of cool if
something goes wrong I can maybe trade
it in for another one I don't know how
that works if there's only 1300 of them
or so but good good to know alright cool
documentation out of the way let's take
a look at the mug itself it says this
does also come with a mug and not just a
mug holder has a fairly nice mug it's a
20 ounce got a nice Razer logo for
gamers by gamers on the bottom there
just kind of have like this nice
metallic finish it's matte I'm glad it's
not nasty and glossy we've also got a
nice little lid here lid with a little
locking mechanism it doesn't seem like
it's too secure when it's when it's
locked it's very easy to just slide it I
could see some accidental slippage here
and maybe spilling some hot stuff all
your all over your face the cap however
the actual cap inlay is pretty pretty
solid here's a look at the inside its
it's a mug you drink out of it you know
it definitely looks like it can hold
liquid good stuff there now RGB lighting
on the mug itself unfortunately I know I
know that's just come on where what do
what do you guys think it and then we've
got the the main main star of the show
here which is the mug holder
I had to repackage this for the video so
it didn't actually come all fray like
the cabling did not look this messy
that's just me so here it is it does
have the RGB lighting around the bottom
we'll take a closer look at that later
it's got a nice rubber grip on the
bottom as well so it doesn't slip around
on your desk surface and the RGB
lighting is activated any time you put
the mug
on top of the actual coaster so it's a
pressure activated it just kind of goes
down a millimeter or so and it activates
the button or something like that and
lights turn on the braided cables fairly
nice it's a USB braided cable I believe
it's anywhere from four to six weeks
can't really tell right now got a Razer
logo here it says signature Black
Edition signature Black Edition and even
has an engraving of the number the
number unit that you have out of 1337 so
for 99 out of one three three seven
that's pretty leet if I do say so myself
but that's pretty much all we can do
with this thing in our hands not plugged
in so why don't we go ahead and boot on
a computer to take this bad boy first in
all right people so I've connected the
chroma mug holder to the razor blade
that I have here and let's go ahead and
just check out what we can do with it in
the synapse software I have updated to
the latest version of synapse and that
actually popped up the Razer chroma bug
icon here letting us know that the
device is connected and ready to
customize so initially when I plug this
thing in by default the LEDs on the base
are off so I thought you could only
activate the LEDs by placing the mug on
top but that's not necessarily the case
as we see in the software you've got
options to customize the LEDs with or
without the mug
so without mug set to off right now but
go ahead and switch that to something
like all your static first off just give
you an idea and the color accuracy of
the LEDs is actually quite good this is
kind of a fuchsia tone which of course
needs to match with hot line and it
certainly does the white is a little bit
on the cool side you can see I don't
know if you can tell from the camera
it's a little on the cool side but I've
definitely seen worse with other gaming
peripherals in the past not necessarily
from Razer so this is actually not too
bad for a freaking for a frickin mug
holder here's a look at the green and I
kind of like how it gently fades and
transitions to the next color
even when you're switching it in the
software that's kind of nice so a cool
thing you can do here is you can also
sync whatever led effects that are on
the coaster to other chroma enabled
devices and you can see there's a button
right here that says that in the
software I click that and all of a
sudden my keyboard has changed to the
same LED profile or LED effect as as the
mug holder that's pretty cool you can
also do that with the
with the mug on top of the coasters so
if we let's see spectrum cycling is what
it sets you now when we occupy the mug
holder and now you can see it's going to
cycle through some colors and if we
apply that if we click apply to other
chroma enabled devices then the keyboard
follows suit the bummer the only
downfall here is that by doing that it
actually disables the previous thinks
that we had so when you remove the mug
now the coaster goes back to its off
state or it's no mug state however the
keyboard continues how it was so that's
kind of a bummer you can't have both
things at the same time unless I have
completely missed something I'm going to
go ahead and switch this to breathing
when when the mug is off I like it to
breathe and let's do like a dark red as
if we're running on empty and we'll just
do red by itself so now it should be
breathing red and it is that's cool and
then with the mug I do like the the wave
effect I'm quite partial to the wave
effect when the mugs on top of it so
there's my there's my profile so I can
save this now as whatever profile I want
I can name it I can make a number of
these profiles and I can even link it to
a program which is which is a super
super handy so altogether I'm very
satisfied with this stuff with this with
this coaster and I have had one one one
the serving of coffee with this coaster
so far and I can tell you the coffee
actually tastes better it tastes at
least twenty percent more colorful so
really quick and one to mention that
apart from the included mug the coaster
also supports different kinds of
glassware I've tested this with beer
bottles wine glasses probably not so
much because the base will probably be a
bit too big for the coaster itself to
fit within the rim but everything else
seems heavy enough to depress that
pressure sensor and activate the LEDs
beneath so that's that's good to know
you don't you're not completely limited
to just the actual mug
I guess my closing thoughts on the
chroma mug holder are generally positive
I think it works very well I like how it
integrates very seamlessly with the
chroma software you wouldn't even
realize that this was just kind of a
freebie I mean if this was actually
being sold in retail stores or on
fine I'm sure it would sell and that
kind of brings me to the question of has
razor or companies like razor like
Corsair other you know RGB riddled
vendors have they gone too far with RGB
lighting I think the answer is no
generally because otherwise people
wouldn't be buying them otherwise they
wouldn't continue making our GB products
there's clearly a demand for them
people who hate them will always hate
them but the fact is is that RGB is just
an extension of part of why we like PC
building in the first place to make
something our own to customize it to
have a personal attachment to it and so
if RGB lights can help achieve that to
some degree then I guess that's all part
of what makes the PC community special
stop being said I do understand the
argument of well that can also hike up
the price on products for purely
aesthetic reasons when you're just
trying to get the most function out of
it and so that there's an argument to
that too but I think at the end of day
it's going to boil down to you as a user
as always and what your specific needs
are but that's all I have to say for
this video I know it was silly hopefully
you don't take it too seriously
it's a coaster let me know in the
comments though if you would actually
buy this and how much you'd be willing
to pay for this I'm going to close out
the video thank you all so much for
watching be sure to toss me a like on it
if you enjoyed it subscribe to the
channel for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon I love you guys have a
good one and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
