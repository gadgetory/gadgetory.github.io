taking a quick look at Kingston's new
and improved HyperX beast memory now if
you're wondering what the difference is
between this beast and the beast that's
currently out there on the market if you
look down here you can see that these
modules feature fully black painted PCBs
and it's really cool because Kingston is
actually taken a lot of user feedback
and they've sort of responded to that by
re releasing their entire Beast lineup
with these black PCBs and I for one I'm
a huge fan of aesthetic appeal in my rig
and I personally hate it when I see a
really nice-looking DIMM with awesome
heat spreaders and stuff just have a
really nasty looking green circuit board
sticking out the sides it just really
rubs me the wrong way it's like an itch
that I can't scratch and essentially the
kid I'm looking at today will be a 16
gigabyte kit includes two dims so those
are eight gigabyte density sticks and
essentially these the beast lineup of
memory actually comes in a variety of
kits so you can get anywhere from 8 to
64 gigabyte kits a 64 gigabyte kit of
this stuff would actually be 8 8
gigabyte sticks and you can also get
various speeds so the speeds that we're
looking at today are 21 33 mega
transfers per second or a thousand sixty
six point five megahertz which is pretty
darn fast but you can also get anywhere
from 1600 up to 2400 mega transfers per
second with the beast line of memory so
aside from that these are of course ddr3
240 pin dims and they are they do have a
cast latency of 11 and are running on
one point six volts alright so here's a
look up close of one of the two dims in
this kit they are exactly identical in
appearance of course and right off the
bat you can just see the pretty sizable
heat spreader up top there it is
relatively hollow on the inside you're
really just looking at the exterior
shell to do most of your thermal
dissipation but it should prove to do an
effective job at keeping your dims
relatively cool aside from that you get
a fully black module pretty much right
the PCB match matches perfectly with the
heat spreader itself and this entire
thing is just blacked out completely
aside from the HyperX beast and kingston
branding right there you also get that
same branding on the other side
identical except you also gets kit and
module information and as soon as this
focuses I will read you off the kit
model number in case you're interested
so
aah x2 1 C 1 1 T 3 k2 / 16x whoo I was
like reading one of those exams at the
optometrist but I think I passed so
there you guys have it you know this
says bounder look sweet and pretty much
any rig considering most rigs these days
at least have some element of black in
them but that's going to wrap it up for
this quick unboxing and look at
Kingston's very new and improved HyperX
beast memory kit once again this is a 16
gigabyte kit - 8 gig dims and yeah be
sure to hit that like button if you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
