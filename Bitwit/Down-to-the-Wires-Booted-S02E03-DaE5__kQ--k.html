everybody welcome to booted once again
this is a episode 3 season 2 it's good
to have you all in chat it's a nice
seeing you here here on twitch the most
glorious platform of them all I am now
convinced thank you guys so much for
being here I know that for a lot of you
people have their own preferences for
which platform they like to view content
from whether it be live streaming or
pre-recorded so I know this might have
been a difficult or sudden switch for a
lot of you coming from YouTube this
being a original youtube series and
moving here to twitch but due to all the
copyright claim issues that I've been
having lately in the last week or so I
really do appreciate all the support
that you guys have shown and just uh you
guys seen you guys in chat is really
evident of that support so I really
appreciate it thank you guys but we're
here to have a good time if you guys
wanted a quick update on what's been
going on with the copyright claim just
to just to really briefly touch on it I
have been still in talks with full
screen they did get back to me today
they're simply asking for more
information about the contents of the
video that was flagged for copyright
infringement that pretty much left to
strike a copyright strike on my channel
two more strikes and the channels dunzo
for life but they're just trying to
figure out what exactly happened the
contents of that video it would have
been nice if I could have just linked
them the video and been like we'll just
here see for yourselves but the videos
already been taken down the gameplay
footage you know let's play basically
that i did with with Steve two years ago
um so they're doing their best or at
least I hope they are to get everything
resolved and they've even admitted
themselves that a copyright strike on
the channel is a bit extreme for given
the circumstances I wasn't exploiting
the game in any way it was mario kart 8
nor was i pointing out any glitches in
the game it was just literally me and
Steve you know doing how we do talk and
shoot on each other as we were racing
and stuff like that so hopefully it gets
resolved soon I'm hoping for the best
i'm hoping that eventually we can bring
the stream back we can bring booted back
to YouTube at this point though I mean
if they live
the streaming restriction and I can once
again stream to YouTube I think I might
just start streaming to both just so
it's not so jarring so it's never like
okay which which which site is he going
to be streaming to today you know if
this ever happens again in the future I
would like to keep the option open to
have the show stream to both platforms I
think that might be the for the best
given the circumstances so stay tuned
for more updates you can follow me on
twitter app forever a Kyle if you if you
dig and yeah that's pretty much it so
I'm thank you all for being patient in
the meantime now there is before we dive
into our last our final five contestants
for this season there is something that
we have to resolve from last week's
episode of booted and that was a
potential vulnerability or abuse of of
the straw poll voting system which is
kind of my bad in a way because I didn't
enforce the the CAPTCHA to prove that
you're not a robot so apparently some of
the votes might have been stacked and I
can't really be sure if that's the case
but in the name of fairness I have
issued a revote on two on the two
highest ranking pcs from last week's
episode so right about now you'll be
seeing a link going to chat my beautiful
wife Heather is on the other line on our
on her system and she's going to be
posting a link in chat for you guys to
revote now before you go ahead and pick
one or two there's only two options here
go ahead and look at these two
contenders so number one is Mac this is
max pc and this is number two this is
Robert okay so I just want you guys to
soak it all in take a look at which pc
you think deserves to go on to the final
round for this season here's number one
once again number one is Mac and number
two Robert
alright guys got that all right I'm
gonna let you guys think about it just
for a sec I'm going to go ahead and show
you one more time number one is over
here vote for number one if you like
this one and vote for number two if you
like this one okay and I'm gonna take
that take a look at the results in just
a moment I'm gonna give you guys a
little bit of time to think about it and
also for people who are just getting
here since this is right at the start of
the show so while you guys are deciding
that and while we're giving it some time
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at
our sponsor just really briefly once
again we've got fantex with their
awesome awesome awesome hardware haha
pun not intended that would snuck up on
me but yeah we've got a lot of cool
stuff there evolved ATX is an amazing
full full or mid tower case go ahead and
check that out also there's a panel down
below the twitch video player where you
can click and open up this website their
power splitter allows you to essentially
take two power supplies to power a
single mother board I'm sorry it takes
one power supply to power several
motherboards to other boards to be exact
and they're actually going to be
flipping this on its head pretty soon
with their power combo system and that
unit essentially does the inverse of
what the power splitter does so it
allows you to take two unique power
supplies to power one pc and benefits of
that include things like redundancy so
if one power supply were to fail you
have a second one to back it up so this
eliminates the need for like a UPS
uninterruptible power supply for example
and also giving you you know the
addition the option of upgrading your
power solution if you happen to be if
you if you want to save some money let's
say you get a new graphics card that has
a higher TDP your current power supply
can't cut it you can use the power combo
and slot basically install a second
power supply in there you know typically
on the cheap and that'll give you enough
enough power to uh to drive that system
they've also got extension cables there
n through proem is a pretty awesome case
it's really good for budget water
coolers so if you've you know got an aio
in mind you want to get some nice
thermals but you don't want to pay out
the out the wazoo for
a nice case that supports that sort of
thing there n through proem is is a
really nice option has a lot of actual
high-end features that we'd see on the
the evolved ATX for example I really
like the aio the radiator bracket system
here that is removable up at the top
just like the ATX the evolved ATX and
yeah there's a lot of good cooling
potential with this chassis but that's
all I should probably say about the
sponsor will take another look at fantex
later on in the show but why don't we go
ahead and take a look to see once and
for all who last week's finalist should
have been so we've got number one as mac
and number two as robert and as soon as
I click the results button here
whoever's on top in that exact moment is
the winner doesn't matter if I open it
in five seconds later the the ranking
switches it's whoever is at the top
right when i click results and i've
specified this in the previous episode
so hopefully there's no confusion there
alright here we go number one or number
two who is last week's season two
finalists boom number one Mack alright
fifty-nine percent of the vote yes sir
you you you for sure have have now
secured your place in the final round
next week so congratulations sir robert
i'm sorry i know you were the the
alleged finalist last week but there was
some discrepancy or there were some
issues with the voting system and i
think now that i've implemented the
captcha the capture requirement in straw
poll i think that's going to make it a
little bit more secure but i am still
looking into other avenues or
alternatives for a polling system that
is rock solid in terms of security as
well as doesn't show doesn't allow you
guys the viewers to see the results
until I want you to because I guess that
ruins part of the the suspense right
already knowing beforehand but before I
actually announce the winner and stuff
like that so anyway discussion for later
thank you thank you Mac and Robert and
congratulations again Mac for making it
on to the final round so why don't we go
ahead and take a look at this week's
first contestant
this is technically PC number I don't
know 11 because we've already looked at
10 PC so far in the season this is a our
11th guy but for this episode he's
number one Ethan and no that is not to
be confused with DMC trolls whose name
is also ethan in chat he is a moderator
no he is not giving him any special
treatment here this is a completely
different Ethan but Ethan has a pretty
nice system here this one caught my eye
and was instantly included as a
contestant among all the others on top
of having some decent photo quality here
so that really does play a huge role in
whether or not I choose someone to be on
the show so keep that in mind if you're
going to be submitting in the future so
you've got a salman z9 su 3 i'm not too
familiar with that case but it looks
pretty clean and i'm sure you probably
cleaned it up a bit before you snap
these photos but you've got an AMD
phenom 2 x4 955 Black Edition a CM a
cooler master hyper 212 evo asus
motherboard eight gigs of ram dual
channel asus radeon HD 7770 and i think
that's a fair pairing with the that cpu
more or less you've got a 240 gig SSD
from AMD and a one terabyte WD black
thermal fake power supply no comment
there ok see what you're working with
alright interesting um ok so first off
I'm getting the the blue and red vibe
and again I'm going to be a little bit
more lenient here in terms of aesthetics
because this is the budget season
aesthetics is really one of the biggest
factors when it comes to factoring in
costs I don't know things that look nice
even in the pc industry cost more so i
can't really fault you for the the
mishmash of of a color palette here but
it does look very clean inside in terms
of there's not really much dust so i
like that again you might have dusted it
off before you submitted your pc but it
looks very dust free and clean cable
tidiness on the other hand could be
improved i think particularly these are
these
green and white wires coming up here you
know stemming from your five and a
quarter inch Bay's those are obviously
your front panel connectors and they're
not very pretty because they're they
don't match the other colors in your
system and I think it would have been
wiser had you routed them in one of the
slots in your five and a quarter inch
base so it to kind of like conceal them
a bit more instead of just routing them
straight over to that large cutout on
your motherboard tray so that stands out
to me a bit and I like how much air flow
you have in here you've got plenty of
fans here I think you might be rocking
some negative air pressure because it
looks like you have more exhaust fans
than an intake but i'm not going to
knock you for that I mean the urban
studies shown that negative pressure can
sometimes be more effective than
positive pressure in certain situations
and I don't think that's really an issue
here however I would say that if this
case does have some ventilation at the
bottom of your of your chassis for your
power supply fan then I probably would
have switched that over I probably would
have flipped that unit over just so that
your video card in your power supply
aren't competing for airflow that would
have been a wiser choice I think you
also got your cpu cooler here excellent
choice with the 212 evo however I see
that it's in pull it's in the pull
configuration you've got your fan that's
pulling air through your heat sink and
delivering it outward towards the back
yer case most of the time I think you
know rule of thumb is to have it in push
that generally provides a degree or two
higher performance or higher thermal
cooling in some cases but I don't know
if you were running into any clearance
issues with that Ram there that you had
altogether though it looks pretty nice
money shot is very pretty this is
definitely a slightly older motherboard
get a brown PCB here again budget season
not going to knock you any points for
that oops and you have some optional
photos here to you clearly wanted me to
see how hollow your five and a quarter
inch bays were or at least where you had
put some of your front pan
connectors so okay I mean that's just a
little bit of dust in there not too bad
though and your SSD there's your a 2 40
gig radeon r7 and clearly there's no
space in this chassis no mounting
solution for two and a half inch drive
and we can kind of tell that from from
the hard drive cage over here older case
probably not going to have two and a
half inch mounts so you just pretty much
left it on the floor um which you know
it doesn't look the best and I don't
like the fact that it's not mounted to
anything so if you were to move your
chassis around you kind of have this
Drive that might be banging against the
sides of that hard drive cage things
like that it's also collecting a lot of
dust wallets down there which obviously
for an SSD doesn't matter much but it
sure doesn't look all that great I would
have probably tried to mount it behind
the motherboard tray with a I don't know
with some adhesive velcro maybe because
you clearly have some room behind this
motherboard tray I mean you've got cable
cutouts and you've got cables that are
being routed behind there so I think a
two-and-a-half-inch you know a seven
millimeter SSD could have been fit back
there as well all together though quite
a nice formidable system you have here
Ethan so I believe you are you are
certainly in the running sir so thank
you for that let's go ahead and move on
to Mario this is PC number two and I
should have been showing off the case
picture first kind of a far away shot
Mario yeah you gotta get it you got to
get it a little bit closer next time
that's ok you've got a cooler master and
200 which I hear is a pretty decent
budget case actually an athlon x4 860 k
also a really great bang for the buck
older older chip from AMD but also
really great price to performance there
you got a cooler master hyper t 4
gigabyte motherboard one stick of
Corsair Vengeance Ram at eight gigabytes
and a gtx 660 let's go ahead and take a
look again at this side profile here ok
i sat in last week's episode that i was
going to knock anyone for for ketchup
and mustard cables because it is the
budget season and
Annunaki here and in fact I think you
did a really good job with your cable
management everything looks really clean
and and tight however the one thing I
would point out is your SATA cables I
feel like you should have probably
routed those through the same cut out as
your PCI Express cable instead of just
dangling them at the bottom of your
chassis it looks a little bit sloppy
that's probably the only thing I would
clean up but all together everything
looks really really clean cable wise
even your your rear exhaust fan there
you you managed to conceal that cable
fairly well so props for you on that I
would have liked to see the cleaner
power supply solution maybe remove that
sticker you know the EVGA one with all
the the specs on it and stuff the rail
configurations not the prettiest but
however at the same time this is a
budget case without a side panel window
so I don't know how much that matters
for you but I don't know for me it's
like if I know how it looks inside it
doesn't matter if there's a side panel
window or not I just I need it to look
good even with the side panel off even
if I can't see it with the side panel on
just a personal preference but but I
suppose I suppose my opinion does have
some value some weight in this series
and looks like you've got your your your
cooler there mounted horizontally again
another rule of thumb for for Chessie's
like this a regular basic mid tower is
to have them mounted vertically with the
with a fan pushing air towards the back
for example but i don't know maybe you
just liked it liked it this way better
there's some clearance issue with with
the RAM which I don't think there is
because your stick is all the way to the
right we've got one corsair vengeance
module all the way to the right and even
in this horizontal position I mean
mounting your your heat sink
horizontally doesn't really do anything
for clearance unless it's for radiator
perhaps that's mounted at the top your
chassis and you don't have one here so
I'm wondering why you mounted it that
way it is in pole I can see at least
you're pulling air up and
out of your case instead of a down onto
your video card that wouldn't be very
good so so that that's that's a good
sign but uh yeah you know I also like
the fact that you're you you managed to
get some corsair vengeance in there even
though it's one stick it's a budget
system you couldn't afford a dual
channel kit at least you got a module
that had a decent looking heatsink on it
instead of just a nasty green PCB stick
so I think that was also a nice choice
for a budget rig this is this is pretty
nice not bad Mario not bad all right
let's move on to carson pc number three
is carson in a fractal design define s
now i find this kind of hilarious
because my $5,000 pc back their hotline
is also in a defined s and yet here we
are in the budget season of booted and
Carson's rocking the same chassis as I
am I think that's kind of funny don't
you and it's a little bit odd in a way
because you have some really low end
components here some really entry level
but still very you know well performing
for what they are pieces of hardware
here like the FX 6300 you've got an r 9
380 in there from gigabyte no SSD but
that's fine but you've got this I don't
know a pretty premium case granted it is
very affordable for what it is and you
have a ton of airflow here I think you
have the best air flow for today's
episode out of all the other contestants
so that's really nice however I can't
just help but think that you could have
used some money you could have saved
some money on a you know on a slightly
cheaper case and put it towards maybe a
better processor or even a better better
video card something that would really
help you with with gaming performance if
that is what you're doing with this
chassis with this rig I should say stock
cooler very frugal very noisy but that's
okay um cable management's could be
better there is room for improvement
there there's your SATA cables or kind
of mixing and matching over
pcie cables and your you know what you
know what it is it's really the the
front panel connectors that are at the
bottom of your motherboard which are
really throwing me off because you've
got a micro ATX motherboard in a full
ATX chassis so unfortunately in the
define s there's no cut outs in the
motherboard tray that accommodate a
smaller form factor motherboard like the
one you have so that that kind of forces
you to drive the cables all the way down
to that bottom power supply grommet and
it looks a bit a bit sloppy I will say
and also for sure the the define us has
a some decent ventilation for the power
supply fan and yet you still decided to
flip it up were upright and have the the
fan competing with your your wind forest
card which I'm a bit confused on it's
like at least if you're going to spend
the you know go the extra mile and buy a
really nice case that's clearly out of
out of your league when it comes to your
other components at least utilize all
the features it has like like power
supply fan ventilation but you might
have your own reasons Who am I to judge
and taking a look at the money shot here
um I would have liked to see again going
back to the the whole dim situation if
you were able to afford this case then I
think you could have also picked up a
nicer looking module there even a dual
channel kit you should have gotten a
dual channel kit and saved you know and
and dumb down the case a little bit
there are certain things here that uh
that aren't perfectly matched together
in my opinion however that being said at
least it's an eight gig module and
functionally it's the system's going to
perform quite well when you're gaming
yeah those are my thoughts Thank You
Carson let's go ahead and take a look at
jam Jan's got an NZXT s 340 are you guys
really like 11 how few NZXT
cases there are the season because I am
I'm really glad that like even at the
budget level there's not just a bunch of
h 4 40's that would have really pissed
me off however it has 340 isn't too bad
if it's just once in the blue moon here
you've also got an F on 24 x 640 another
cooler master cooler righteous
rightfully so eight gigs got a dual
channel kit here kingston ddr3 and a gtx
550 TI cyclone to i have not seen a
system with that card in a while it's
been years but i was that was a kind of
interesting video card I was like I was
like one of the rudest video cards I've
ever seen and by that I mean like you
know if you look at the cooler it's not
really enclosed in any way and it's
essentially exhausting hot air from all
sides just heating up the rest of your
chassis and warming up the rest of your
components it's very rude it's a very
encroaching on the other hardware there
but it does look nice in the system it's
got some can't tell if it's got any blue
accents to match your motherboard but
does look nice money shot here again
those hideous green two modules they
should be they should all be burned so
we burned promptly oh sorry about that
oh you sent me an LED shot okay this is
cool you know the system actually looks
better with the lights off and that you
can interpret that however you want but
it really looks nice with the blue
accent lighting I think you know you got
a blue motherboard in there a bluish
blueish accents I think it looks really
nice it's just when the lights are on I
feel like there could have been a bit
more color coordination you've got those
SSDs in there those uh those two
kingston ssdnow 300s they're both 120
gigs my assumption is that they're in
raid 0 that you've got some striping
business going on and if that's the case
and your operating system is installed
on that raid array I would just make
sure that you have a an image backup of
your operating system
update that frequently because you're
essentially doubling your risk of dry
failure by installing your OS on there
on a raid 0 right I thought in the past
and I was fine knock on wood I mean I
was good but you might not be so lucky
so just make sure that you've got you
know what you're doing but cable
management not bad you do have you have
this one cable that's going down into
that power supply shroud which I guess
maybe you could have routed that behind
the reservoir bar here in the s3 40 but
all together this is really tidy and
you've got some nice black flat you know
style cables and I think that looks
really nice as well so all together
pretty good jam the one thing I the
other thing critic I'll say is I don't
know what this is on you're on the side
of your case on the right side I'm like
towards the front panel I don't know if
that's tape that's on the actual
enclosure I don't know how to get rid of
that and and try dusting off your system
it looks a little dusty to me what you
guys think yeah anyway last contender
for today is Antoine I keep wanting to
say Antwone Fisher you wanted to say
that all day Antwone Fisher no Antoine
you've got a corsair carbide 100 are
excellent budget case i like your like
your taste noctua nhu 12 p SC two
excellent cooler I haven't had the
privilege of testing it personally but
as is the case with most noctua coolers
they freaking rock and it looks beastly
in the system it's just like it barely
fits if you look at the side profile
here it's like any any taller you
probably would be able to fit the side
panel on but good job on you mate for
that close call compatibility you've
also got a gigabyte motherboard eight
gigs of ram dual channel got some hyperx
in there hyperx fury those blue those
blue dims
yeah none of that green that green crap
got an ice q I always cracked me up H is
but they're they're cooler names the ice
q radeon HD 7870 gigahertz edition still
a really nice card and I'm sure you get
some yup some good gaming sessions with
it still along with that FX 6300 I'm
sure you've got it overclocked as far as
you can take it with that cooler which
is nice one terabyte WD scorpio blue and
if I 50 watt power supply from the
cooler master this is a really clean
system I like this a lot and again like
I got a tip my hat to corsair for making
a killer budget chassis here with the
the carbide 100 are because the it's got
really good cable routing options and
you have you seem to have taken
advantage of that here so kudos to you
on that the cards saggin a little bit
huh some sag some some GPU sag there
which I don't know maybe you can get
like one of those pcie brackets for it
the pci brackets that might be cool but
you know you know what man this is a
pretty good system i like it and it
looks like you've also got a Wi-Fi card
or something like that in the top by one
slot you know because this is a really
good system i think this is one of the
stronger contenders now I can't fault
you for the ketchup and mustard I'm just
saying it would have been nice if that
one 24-pin connector was black or white
or blue or any color besides ketchup and
mustard I'm not even gonna dock you
points for it I'm just gonna say that
would really clean things up a bit but
Thank You Antoine this is a really nice
rig and that's pretty much all the pcs
those are the last five contestants for
season two guys those are the last
budget rigs you're going to see on the
show for quite some time because uh just
to give you guys a little update I
received all of your booted submissions
for next season for the
high-end $1,500 or more seasoned and I
sorted through about 200 of them in one
sitting it took me like two hours to go
through all of them ah but they're good
they're they look really good and I
think because i have so many submissions
we might be doing i might be doing to
high-end seasons back to back i'm not
sure yet don't quote me on that you can
let me know what you think either in
chat or leave me a comment or tweet me
but there's some good stuff in there so
yeah thank you guys for submitting and f
you guys for submitting because i
haven't been able to sleep downloading
and organizing all those entries all
right now uh at this time you should be
getting a link to links in chat again my
wife is on it she's always on it she's
she's a firecracker that one so the
first link will be linked to the photo
album of all the contestants that we've
just taken a look at make sure you look
at them very carefully and choose wisely
because the second link you'll be
receiving in chat is the voting straw
poll and there you will vote on which pc
you think deserves to go on to the final
round in week 4 which holy crap is next
week I can't believe we're already
almost through March this is just
mind-blowing where's the freakin time
going it's kind of insane but yeah so
choose wisely ladies and ladies and
gentlemen and while you're doing that
I'm going to go ahead and talk about the
Eclipse p400 and the p400 s from fantex
again you can check you can click that
panel that I have below the video player
here on twitch if you want more
information go to their site the Eclipse
p400 just launched few weeks ago and
from what I hear from fantex the case is
been doing really well has been see been
receiving a lot of good feedback not
just from reviewers but from consumers
as well and I can definitely see why
it's a very flexible system for quite an
affordable price actually cheaper than
what you might expect it's like 60 70
bucks and you get a lot of cool features
a lot of the same features that you'd
find on the evolved ATX for example
or any of other of any of fan texts
other high-end chasse ease and the p400
is for those who want to show off the
innards of their system so if you like
side panel windows and you want to bling
it up maybe get some LEDs in there go
for the p400 if you're a silence nazi
and you just want to be as quiet as
freakin possible then go for the p400 s
which I thought didn't have a side panel
window but according to this picture it
also has a side panel window but one
thing I know for sure is that it has
foam padding sound dampening material on
the inside on the internal the panels
and stuff like that so it's quiet it's
really quiet oh here we go window and
close der sometimes it's just right
under your nose and you don't even see
it but yeah there's a closed option so I
guess you could get the p400 s with a
window as well you get the best of both
worlds honestly I would go for the p400
s just just do it just do it and get it
and get in white white looks badass it's
also got this this nice RGB accent
lighting on the bottom of the chassis
and switches between like nine different
colors same as the enthu lux if you guys
are familiar with that or if you've seen
my white build pc on the youtubes same
color options here on the p400 and p
400s so all together really good stuff
from fantex again click that panel below
the video player here on twitch if you
want some more information on that but I
think it's time to check out these
results ladies and gentleman so why
don't we go ahead up no wait no it's not
that one here we go pc yes cue cue
dramatic music I really need like a like
a DJ or something so I feel like change
the music myself because I'm I'm really
bad at doing that and talking at the
same time anyway here are five options
we've taken a look at systems from Ethan
Mario Carson Jan and Antoine and
honestly
this was a tough one for me I think
there were two or three systems that I
could easily see doing really well and
potentially making it to the final round
but ultimately as you guys know by now
it's not up to me it's up to you guys
the live audience so without further ado
who is our Week three finalists for
season two of booted Antoine whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa by a landslide holy
crap sixty-five percent a few chose
Antoine man congratulations you have
done an excellent job of proving that
you have the better pc and i can see why
i was i was kind of rooting for you
secretly uh Ethan Mario Carson and Jan
thank you guys for playing or four
competing and for submitting and making
it this far but I'm sorry the audience
is spoken and you have been booted so
let's take a quick look again at
Antoine's pc very nice my brother just
excellent excellent job all around I
think it's kind of funny how I saved
your system for last I don't think that
was by design but they do say bet best
for last right so there's there's got to
be some some truth to that here so uh
congratulations man you do have some
competition I will say last two last two
dudes they're not messing around also
nice chop on the photo quality that
really helped you I think it helps
everyone photo quality really helps but
damn dan do we already blow through that
frickin episode holy crap it's over it's
over well just for now I don't want to
say it's completely over until I get a
copyright strike on twitch then it's
really freaking over but yeah that's
pretty much gonna do it for now guys up
before you go go ahead and catch it live
if you want to see booted live then
don't follow this slide at all because
it's not going to be on gaming youtube
com or youtube com / awesomesauce
network it's going to be on Twitch same
time but different place five-thirty
p.m. on mondays on twitter on TV
until further notice again I'm still
waiting on the full screen crew to get
back to me on whether or not we can
resolve this issue but yes don't go to
youtube next week either unless I tell
you to but this has been fun I like
streaming to twitch I've always loves
for me to twitch more than YouTube
actually the reason why I had booted
stream to YouTube in the first places
that's just because it's where all my
followers are most of them anyway just
seemed more practical but I think we
have a better time here on Twitch so I'm
cool with that I'm cool with that guys
