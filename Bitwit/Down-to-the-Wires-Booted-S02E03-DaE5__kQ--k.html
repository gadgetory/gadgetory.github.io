everybody welcome to booted once again
this is episode 3 season 2 it's good to
have you all in chat it's a nice seeing
you here here on Twitch the most
glorious platform of them all I am now
convinced thank you guys so much for
being here I know that for a lot of you
people have their own preferences for
which platform they like to view content
from whether it be live streaming or
pre-recorded so I know this might have
been a difficult or sudden switch for a
lot of you coming from YouTube this
being a original youtube series and
moving here to twitch but due to due to
all the copyright claim issues that I've
been having lately in the last week or
so I really do appreciate all the
support that you guys have shown and
just you guys seeing you guys in chat is
really evident of that support so I
really appreciate it thank you guys but
we're here to have a good time if you
guys wanted a quick update on what's
been going on with the copyright claim
just to just to really briefly touch on
it I have been still in talks with
fullscreen they did get back to me today
they're simply asking for more
information about the contents of the
video that was flagged for copyright
infringement that pretty much left a
strike a copyright strike on my channel
two more strikes and the channels dunzo
for life but they're just trying to
figure out what exactly happened the
contents of that video it would have
been nice if I could have just linked
them the video and been like well just
here see for yourselves but the video
has already been taken down the gameplay
footage you know let's play basically
that I did with with Steve two years ago
so they're doing their best or at least
I hope they are to get everything
resolved and they've even admitted
themselves that a copyright strike on
the channel is a bit extreme for given
the circumstances I wasn't exploiting
the game in any way it was Mario Kart 8
nor was I pointing out any glitches in
the game it was just literally me and
Steve you know doing how we do talk and
shoot on each other as we were racing
and stuff like that so hopefully it gets
resolved
soon I'm hoping for the best I'm hoping
that eventually we can bring the stream
back we can bring booted back to YouTube
at this point though I mean if they live
the streaming restriction and I can once
again stream to YouTube I think I might
just start streaming to both just so
it's not so jarring so it's never like
okay which which which side is he going
to be streaming to today you know if
this ever happens again in the future
I would like to keep the option open to
have the show stream to both platforms I
think that might be the for the best
given the circumstances so stay tuned
for more updates you can follow me on
twitter at forever a kyle if you if you
dig and yeah that's pretty much it
so i'm thank you all for being patient
in the meantime now there is before we
dive into our last our final five
contestants for this season there is
something that we have to resolve from
last week's episode of booted and that
was a potential vulnerability or abuse
of the straw poll voting system which is
kind of my bad in a way because i didn't
enforce the the CAPTCHA to prove that
you're not a robot so apparently some of
the votes might have been stacked and i
can't really be sure if that's the case
but in the name of fairness i have
issued a revote on two on the two
highest ranking pcs from last week's
episode so right about now you'll be
seeing a link going to chat my beautiful
wife heather is on the other line on our
on her system and she's gonna be posting
a link in chat for you guys to revote
now before you go ahead and pick one or
two there's only two options here go
ahead and look at these two contenders
so number one is mac this is max pc and
this is number two this is robert okay
so i just want you guys to soak it all
in
take a look at which pc you think
deserves to go on to the final round for
this season here's number one once again
number one is mac and number two robert
all right you guys got that
all right I'm gonna let you guys think
about it just for a sec I'm gonna go
ahead and show you one more time number
one is over here but for number one if
you like this one and vote for number
two if you like this one okay and I'm
gonna take that take a look at the
results in just a moment I'm gonna give
you guys a little bit of time to think
about it and also for people who are
just getting here since this is right at
the start of the show so while you guys
are deciding that and while we're giving
it some time we're gonna go ahead and
take a look at our sponsor just really
briefly once again we've got fantex with
their awesome awesome awesome hardware
haha pun not intended that would snuck
up on me but yeah we've got a lot of
cool stuff they're evolved ATX is an
amazing full full or mid tower case go
ahead and check that out also there's a
panel down below the twitch video player
where you can click and open up this
website their power splitter allows you
to essentially take two power supplies
to power a single motherboard I'm sorry
it takes one power supply to power
several motherboards to two other boards
to be exact and they're actually gonna
be flipping this on its head pretty soon
with their power combo system and that
unit essentially does the inverse of
what the power splitter does so it
allows you to take two unique power
supplies to power one PC and benefits of
that include things like redundancy so
if one power supply were to fail you
have a second one to back it up so this
eliminates the need for like a UPS and
an uninterruptible power supply for
example and also giving you you know the
addition the option of upgrading your
power solution if you happen to be if
you if you want to save some money let's
say you got a new graphics card that has
a higher TDP your current power supply
can't cut it you can use the power combo
and slot basically install a second
power supply in there you know typically
on the cheap and that'll give you enough
enough power to uh to drive that system
they've also got extension cables there
and through Pro em is a pretty awesome
case it's really good for budget water
coolers so if you've you know got an AI
o in mind you want to get some nice
thermals but you don't want to pay out
the out the wazoo for for a nice case
that supports that sort of thing
there and through proem is is a really
nice option has a lot of actual high-end
features that we'd see on the the
evolved ATX for example I really like
the the a IO the radiator bracket system
here that is removable up at the top
just like the ATX the evolved ATX and
yeah there's a lot of good cooling
potential with this chassis but that's
all I should probably say about the
sponsor will take another look at fantex
later on in the show but why don't we go
ahead and take a look to see once and
for all who last week's finalist should
have been so we've got number one as Mac
and number two as Roberts and as soon as
I click the results button here
whoever's on top in that exact moment is
the winner doesn't matter if I open it
in five seconds later the the ranking
switches its whoever is at the top right
when I click results and I've specified
this in the previous episode so
hopefully there's no confusion there all
right here we go number one or number
two who is last week's season two
finalists boom
number one Mac all right 59% of the vote
yes sir you you you for sure have have
now secured your place in the final
round next week so congratulations Sir
Robert I'm sorry I know you were the the
alleged finalist last week but there was
some discrepancy or there were some
issues with the voting system and I
think now that I've implemented the
CAPTCHA the capture requirement in
strawpoll I think that's gonna make it a
little bit more secure but I am still
looking into other avenues or
alternatives for a polling system that
is rock-solid in terms of security as
well as doesn't show you doesn't allow
you guys the viewers to see the results
until I want you to because I guess that
ruins part of the suspense right already
knowing beforehand but before I actually
announce the winner and stuff like that
so anyway discussion for later thank you
Thank You Mac and Robert and
congratulations again Mac for making it
on to the final round so why don't we go
ahead and take a look at this week's
first contestant this is technically
PC number I don't know 11 because we've
already looked at 10 pcs so far in the
season this is our 11th guy but for this
episode he's number one Ethan and no
that is not to be confused with DMC
trolls whose name is also Ethan in chat
he is a moderator no he is not giving
him any special treatment here this is a
completely different Ethan but Ethan has
a pretty nice system here this one
caught my eye and was instantly included
as a contestant among all the others on
top of having some decent photo quality
here so that really does play a huge
role in whether or not I choose someone
to be on the show so keep that in mind
if you're gonna be submitting in the
future so you've got a Zalman z9 su3 I'm
not too familiar with that case but it
looks pretty clean and I'm sure you've
probably cleaned it up a bit before you
snap these photos but you've got an AMD
phenom ii x4 955 Black Edition a cm
cooler master hyper 212 evo asus
motherboard 8 gigs of ram dual channel
Asus Radeon HD 7770 and I think that's a
fair pairing with that CPU
more or less you've got a 240 gig SSD
from AMD and a one terabyte WD black
thermal fake power supply no comment
there okay see what you're working with
alright interesting ok so first off I'm
getting the blue and red vibe and again
I'm gonna be a little bit more lenient
here in terms of aesthetics because this
is the budget season aesthetics is
really one of the biggest factors when
it comes to factoring in cost I don't
know things that look nice even in the
PC industry cost more so I can't really
fault you for the the mishmash of of a
color palette here but it does look very
clean inside in terms of there's not
really much dust so I like that again
you might have dusted it off before you
submitted your PC but it looks very dust
free and clean cable tidiness on the
other hand could be improved I think
particularly these are these green and
white wires coming up
you're you know stemming from your five
and a quarter inch bays those are
obviously your front panel connectors
and they're they're not very pretty
because they're they don't match the
other colors in your system and I think
it would have been wiser had you routed
them in one of the slots in your five
and a quarter inch base to kind of like
conceal them a bit more instead of just
routing them straight over to that large
cutout on your motherboard tray so that
stands out to me a bit and I like how
much airflow you have in here you've got
plenty of fans here I think you might be
rocking some negative air pressure cuz
it looks like you have more exhaust fans
than an intake but I'm not gonna knock
you for that I mean the urban studies
shown that negative pressure can
sometimes be more effective than
positive pressure in certain situations
and I don't think that's really an issue
here however I would say that if this
case does have some ventilation at the
bottom of your of your chassis for your
power supply fan then I probably would
have switched that over I probably would
have flipped that unit over just so that
your video card in your power supply
aren't competing for air flow that would
have been a wiser choice I think you
also got your CPU cooler here excellent
choice with the 212 Evo however I see
that it's an in pull it's in the pull
configuration you've got your fan that's
pulling air through your heatsink and
delivering it outward towards the back Y
case most of the time I think you know
rule of thumb is to have it in push that
generally provides a degree or two
higher performance or higher thermal
cooling in some cases but I don't know
if you were running into any clearance
issues with that Ram there that you had
all together though it looks pretty nice
money shot is very pretty this is
definitely a slightly older motherboard
got a brown PCB here again budget season
not gonna knock you any points for that
oops and you have some optional photos
here too you clearly wanted me to see
how hollow your five and a quarter inch
bays were or at least where you had put
some of your front panel connectors so
okay
I mean that's there's a little bit of
dust in there not too bad though
and your SSD there's your 240 gig radeon
r7 and clearly there's no space in this
chassis no mounting solution for two and
a half inch drive and we can kind of
tell that from from the the hard drive
cage over here older case probably not
gonna have two and a half inch mounts so
you just pretty much left it on the
floor which you know it doesn't look the
best and I don't like the fact that it's
not mounted to anything so if you were
to move your chassis around you kind of
have this Drive that might be banging
against the sides of that hard drive
cage things like that it's also
collecting a lot of dust wallets down
there which obviously for an SSD doesn't
matter much but it sure doesn't look all
that great I would have probably tried
to mount it behind the motherboard tray
with a I don't know with some adhesive
velcro maybe because you clearly have
some room behind this motherboard tray I
mean you've got cable cutouts and you've
got cables that are being routed behind
there
so I think a two and a half inch you
know a seven millimeter SSD could have
been fit back there as well all together
though quite a nice formidable system
you have here Ethan so I believe you are
you are certainly in the running sir
so thank you for that let's go ahead and
move on to Mario this is PC number two
and I should have been showing off the
case picture first kind of a far away
shot Mario got it you gotta get it you
gotta get it a little bit closer next
time that's okay you've got a cooler
master and 200 which I hear is a pretty
decent budget case actually and athlon
x4 860 K also a really great bang for
the buck older older chip from AMD but
also really great price to performance
there you got a cooler master hyper T 4
gigabyte motherboard one stick of
Corsair Vengeance Ram at 8 gigabytes and
the gtx 660 let's go ahead and take a
look again at this side profile here ok
i said in last week's episode that I
wasn't gonna knock anyone for for
ketchup and mustard cables because it is
the budget season and I'm not gonna
knock you here
and in fact I think he did a really good
job with your cable management
everything looks really clean and and
tight however the one thing I would
point out is your SATA cables I feel
like you should have probably routed
those through the same cut out as your
PCI Express cable instead of just
dangling them at the bottom of your
chassis it looks a little bit sloppy
that's probably the only thing I would
clean up but altogether everything looks
really really clean cable wise even your
your rear exhaust fan they're you you
managed to conceal that cable fairly
well so props for you on that I would
have liked to see a cleaner power supply
solution maybe remove that sticker
you know the EVGA one with all the the
specs on it and stuff the rail
configurations not the prettiest but
however at the same time this is a
budget case without a side panel window
so I don't know how much that matters to
you but I don't know for me it's like if
I know how it looks inside it doesn't
matter if there's a side panel window or
not I just I need it to look good even
with the side panel off even if I can't
see it with the side panel on just a
personal preference but but I suppose I
suppose my opinion does have some value
some weight in this series and looks
like you've got your your your cooler
they're mounted horizontally again
another rule of thumb for for chassis
like this a regular basic mid Tower is
to have them mounted vertically with the
with the fan pushing air towards the
back for example but I don't know maybe
you just liked it liked it this way
better there's some clearance issue with
with the RAM which I don't think there
is because your stick is all the way to
the right we've got one Corsair
Vengeance module all the way to the
right and even in this horizontal
position I mean mounting your your
heatsink horizontally doesn't really do
anything for clearance unless it's for
radiator perhaps that's mounted at the
top your chassis and you don't have one
here so I'm wondering why you mounted it
that way it is in pole I can see at
least you're pulling air up and out of
your case instead of a
down onto your video card that wouldn't
be very good so so that that's that's a
good sign but yeah you know I also like
the fact that you're you you managed to
get some Corsair Vengeance in there even
though it's one stick it's a budget
system you couldn't afford a
dual-channel kit at least you got a
module that had a decent looking
heatsink on it instead of just a nasty
green PCB stick so I think that was also
a nice choice for a budget rig this is
this is pretty nice
not bad Mario not bad all right let's
move on to Carson PC number three is
Carson in a fractal design define s now
I find this kind of hilarious because my
$5,000 PC back there hotline is also in
a define s and yet here we are in the
budget season of booted and Carson's
rockin the same chassis as I am I think
that's kind of funny
don't you and it's a little bit odd in a
way because you have some really low end
components here some really entry-level
but still very you know well performing
for what they are pieces of hardware
here like the FX 6300 you've got an R 9
380 in there from gigabyte no SSD but
that's fine but you've got this I don't
know a pretty premium case granted it is
very affordable for what it is and you
have a ton of air flow here I think you
have the best airflow for today's
episode out of all the other contestants
so that's really nice
however I can't just help but think that
you could have used some money you could
have saved some money on a you know on a
slightly cheaper case and put it towards
maybe a better processor or even a
better better video card something that
would really help you with with gaming
performance if that is what you're doing
with this chassis with this rig I should
say stock cooler very frugal very noisy
but that's ok
cable management's could be better
there's room for improvement there
there's your SATA cables or kind of
mixing and mashing over your PCIe
cables and you're you know what you know
what it is it's really the the front
panel connectors that are at the bottom
of your motherboard which are really
throwing me off because you've got a
micro ATX motherboard in a full ATX
chassis so and unfortunately in the
define s there's no cutouts in the
motherboard tray that accommodate a
smaller form factor motherboard like the
one you have so that that kind of forces
you to drive the cables all the way down
to that bottom power supply grommet and
it looks a bit a bit sloppy I will say
and also for sure the the define s has a
some decent ventilation for the power
supply fan and yet you still decided to
flip it up were upright and have the the
fan competing with your your wind force
card which I'm a bit confused on it's
like at least if you're gonna spend the
you know go the extra mile and buy a
really nice case that's clearly out of
out of your league when it comes to your
other components at least utilize all
the features it has like like power
supply fan ventilation but you might
have your own reasons Who am I to judge
and taking a look at the money shot here
I would have liked to see again going
back to the the whole dim situation if
you were able to afford this case then I
think you could have also picked up a
nicer looking module there even a dual
channel kit you should have gotten a
dual channel kit and saved you know and
and dumped down the case a little bit
there are certain things here that uh
that aren't perfectly matched together
in my opinion however that being said at
least it's an 8 gig module and
functionally it's the system's going to
perform quite well when you're gaming
yeah those are my thoughts Thank You
Carson let's go ahead and take a look at
Jan Jan's got an NZXT s340 are you guys
really like lovin how few NZXT cases
there are the season because I
I'm really glad that like even at the
budget level there's not just a bunch of
h4 40s that would have really pissed me
off
however in s340 isn't too bad if it's
just once in the blue moon here you've
also got an F on - 4 X 640 another
cooler master cooler righteous
rightfully so eight gigs got a
dual-channel kid here kingston ddr3 and
a gtx 550 ti Cyclone - i have not seen a
system with that card in a while it's
been years but I was that was a kind of
interesting video card it was like I was
like one of the rudest video cards I've
ever seen and by that I mean like you
know if you look at the cooler it's not
really enclosed in any way and it's
essentially exhausting hot air from all
sides just heating up the rest of your
chassis and warming up the rest of your
components it's very rude it's a very
encroaching on the other hardware there
but it does look nice in this system
it's got some I can't tell if it's got
any blue accents to match your
motherboard but it does look nice money
shot here again those hideous green -
modules they should be they should all
be burned so we burnt promptly oh sorry
about that
oh you sent me an LED shot okay this is
cool you know the system actually looks
better with the lights off and that you
can interpret that however you want but
it really looks nice with the blue
accent lighting I think you know you got
a blue motherboard in there a blueish
blueish accents I think it looks really
nice it's just when the lights are on I
feel like there could have been a bit
more color coordination you've got those
SSDs in there those uh those two
Kingston SSDs
they're both 120 gigs my assumption is
that they're in raid zero that you've
got some striping business going on and
if that's the case and your operating
system is installed on that raid array I
would just make sure that you have an
image backup of your operating system up
that frequently because you're
essentially doubling your risk of dry
failure by installing your OS on there
on a raid zero right I thought in the
past and I was fine knock on wood I mean
I was good but you might not be so lucky
so just make sure that you've got you
know what you're doing but cable
management not bad you do have you have
this one cable that's going down into
that power supply shroud which I guess
maybe you could have routed that behind
the reservoir bar here in the s340
but altogether this is really tidy and
you've got some nice black flat you know
style cables and I think that looks
really nice as well so all together
pretty good gen the one thing uh the
other thing critique I'll say is I don't
know what this is on your on the side of
your case on the right side I'm like
towards the front panel I don't know if
that's tape that's on the actual
enclosure I don't know how to get rid of
that and and try dusting off your system
it looks a little dusty to me what you
guys think yeah anyway last contender
for today is Antoine I keep wanting to
say Antwone Fisher you wanted to say
that all day Antwone Fisher no Antoine
you've got a corsair carbide 100 are
excellent budget case I like your I like
your taste Noctua Nhu 1 2 p SE -
excellent cooler I haven't had the
privilege of testing it personally but
as is the case with most Noctua coolers
they freaking Rock and it looks beastly
in this system it's just like it barely
fits if you look at the side profile
here it's like any any taller you
probably wouldn't be able to fit the
side panel on but good job on you mate
for that close call compatibility you've
also got a gigabyte motherboard 8 gigs
of ram dual channel got some HyperX in
there HyperX fury those blue those blue
dims yeah none of that green
on that green crap got a nice Q I always
crack me up
H is but they're they're cooler names
the ice Q Radeon HD 7870 gigahertz
edition still a really nice card and I'm
sure you get some good gaming sessions
with it still along with that FX 6300
I'm sure you've got it overclocked as
far as you can take it with that cooler
which is nice one terabyte WD Scorpio
blue and a 550 watt power supply from
the Kula master this is a really clean
system I like this a lot
and again like I got to tip my hat to
Corsair for making a killer budget
chassis here with the the carbide 100 R
because the it's got really good cable
routing options and you have you seem to
have taken advantage of that here so
kudos to you on that the cards saggin a
little bit huh there's some sag some
some GPU sag there which I don't know
maybe you can get like one of those PCIe
brackets for it
the pci brackets that might be cool but
you know you know what man
this is a pretty good system I don't
like it and it looks like you've also
got a Wi-Fi card or something like that
in the top by one slot you know because
this is a really good system I think
this is one of the stronger contenders
no I I can't fault you for the ketchup
and mustard I I'm just saying it would
have been nice if that one 24-pin
connector was black or white or blue or
any color besides ketchup and mustard
I'm not even gonna dock you points for
it I'm just gonna say that would really
clean things up a bit but thank you
Antoine this is a really nice rig and
that's pretty much all the PCs those are
the last five contestants for season two
guys those are the last budget rigs
you're gonna see on the show for quite
some time because just to give you guys
a little update I received all of your
booted submissions for next season for
the high end $1500 or more season
and I sorted through about 200 of them
in one sitting it took me like two hours
to go through all of them but they're
good they're they look really good and I
think because I have so many submissions
we might be doing I might be doing to
high end seasons back-to-back I'm not
sure yet don't quote me on that you can
let me know what you think either in
chat or leave me a comment or tweet me
but there's some good stuff in there
so yeah thank you guys for submitting
and fu guys for submitting because I
haven't been able to sleep downloading
and organizing all those entries all
right now uh at this time you should be
getting a link to links in chat again my
wife is on it she's always on it she's
she's a firecracker that one so the
first link will be linked to the photo
album of all the contestants that we've
just taken a look at make sure you look
at them very carefully and choose wisely
because the second link you'll be
receiving in chat is the voting straw
poll and there you will vote on which PC
you think deserves to go on to the final
round in week four which holy crap is
next week I can't believe we're already
almost through March this is just
mind-blowing where's the freaking time
going it's kind of insane but yeah so
choose wisely ladies and ladies and
gentlemen and while you're doing that
I'm gonna go ahead and talk about the
eclipses p400 and the p400s from fantex
again you can check you can click that
panel that I have below the video player
here on twitch if you want more
information go to their site the
eclipses p400 just launched a few weeks
ago and from what I hear from fantex the
cases been doing really well has been
Steve been receiving a lot of good
feedback not just from reviewers but
from consumers as well and I can
definitely see why it's a very flexible
system for quite an affordable price
actually cheaper than what you might
expect it's like 60 70 bucks and you got
a lot of cool features a lot of the same
features that you'd find on the Evolve
ATX for example or any of other any of
fan taxes other
high-end chassé ease and the p400 is for
those who want to show off the innards
of their system so if you like side
panel windows and you want to bling it
up maybe get some LEDs in there go for
the P 400 if you're a silence Nazi and
you just want to be as quiet as freaking
possible then go for the p400s which I
thought didn't have a side panel window
but according to this picture it also
has a side panel window but one thing I
know for sure is that it has foam
padding sound dampening material on the
inside on the internal the panels and
stuff like that so it's quiet it's
really quiet oh here we go window and
close dirt sometimes it's just right
under your nose and you don't even see
it but yeah there's a closed option so I
guess you could get the p400s with a
window as well you get the best of both
worlds honestly I would go for the p400s
just just do it just do it and get it
and get in white white looks badass it's
also got this this nice RGB accent
lighting on the bottom of the chassis
and switches between like 9 different
colors same as the enthu Lux if you guys
are familiar with that or if you've seen
my white build PC on the youtubes same
color options here on the P 400 and
p400s so all together really good stuff
from fantex again click that panel below
the video player here on twitch if you
want some more information on that but I
think it's time to check out these
results ladies and gentleman so why
don't we go ahead up no wait no it's not
that one here we go PC yes cue cue
dramatic music I really need like like a
DJ or something so I feel like change
the music myself because I'm a really
I'm really bad at doing that and talking
at the same time anyway here are five
options we've taken a look at systems
from Ethan Mario Carson Jan and Antoine
and honestly this was a tough one for me
I think there were two or three systems
that I could easily see
doing really well and potentially making
it to the final round but ultimately as
you guys know by now it's not up to me
it's up to you guys the live audience so
without further ado who is our week
three finalist for season two of booted
Antoine whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa by
a landslide
holy crap 65% a few chose Antoine man
congratulations you have done an
excellent job of proving that you have
the better PC and I can see why I was I
was kind of rooting for you secretly
Ethan Mario Carson and Jan thank you
guys for playing or for competing and
for submitting and making it this far
but I'm sorry
the audience has spoken and you have
been booted so let's take a quick look
again at Antoine's PC very nice my
brother just excellent excellent job all
around I think it's kind of funny how I
saved your system for last I don't think
that was by design but they do say but
best for last right so there's there's
got to be some some truth to that here
so uh congratulations man you do have
some competition I will say last two
last two dudes there they're not messing
around
also nice chop on the photo quality that
really helped you I think it helps
everyone photo quality really helps but
damn dan do we already blow through that
freaking episode holy crap it's over
it's over well just for now I don't want
to say it's completely over until I get
a copyright strike on twitch then it's
really freakin over but yeah that's
pretty much gonna do it for now guys uh
before you go go ahead and catch it live
if you want to see booted live then
don't follow this slide at all because
it's not gonna be on gaming youtube calm
or youtube.com slash awesomesauce
network it's going to be on twitch same
time but different place 5:30 p.m. on
Mondays on twitch on TV until further
notice again I'm still waiting on the
full
Green crew to get back to me on whether
or not we can resolve this issue but yes
don't go to YouTube next week either
unless I tell you to but this has been
fun I like streaming to twitch I've
always loves for me to twitch more than
YouTube actually the reason why I had
booted streamed to YouTube in the first
place is that's just because that's
where all my followers are most of them
anyway just seemed more practical but I
think we have a better time here on
Twitch so I'm cool with that
I'm cool with that guys and again thank

episode and for being here really means
a lot and I've got some really good
