the DIY PC market and most of us have
already learned to accept that and while
you can pretty much find any component
riddled with RGB lighting it's really
interesting and quite frankly
entertaining to see how many vendors
continue to push the boundaries and try
to one-up each other and themselves when
it comes to the RGB implementation in
their products and here we have the next
best thing this is the g.skill treaded
Zee Royal kit actually they sent over
two kits these boxes just look at the
boxes let's take a look at the specs
here on this one we've got a 32 gig kit
4 by 8 gig Stix ddr4 3200 speed cast
latency 14 and over here we have exactly
the same kit however there is one small
difference between the model numbers
here we have a G at the end of this one
and an S at the end of this one what
could that mean let's take a closer look
and find out shall we
starting with the G I'll put this over
to the side for now
and let's just look at this packaging
this packaging is unreal it definitely
feels expensive like I'm unboxing a
piece of jewelry or something Oh
cleaning cloth you want to take care of
those modules and Wow
ok gold I guess we know what the G
stands for it stands for gold asked my
stand for silver on the other kit which
will verify in just a moment look at
those beauties what a beautiful
presentation I'm almost afraid to put my
fingers on it so she said so let's just
I'm just gonna pull one out so she said
and let's just let's just see here Wow
whoa they actually have plastic wrap on
either side we're gonna peel one side
off here Oh on the top here you can see
we have sort of a crystalline cap made
of plastic looks like a molded plastic
that's surely going to defuse the
lighting and hide any of the LED
hotspots that are in there note how
minimal the branding is on these sticks
you only get a single tread NZ royal
plug on either side it's very small
there's none whatsoever on the actual
top of the module so when these are
installed you probably won't even see
any sort of branding whatsoever which I
think most people would appreciate the
finish on these is absolutely stunning
I'm sure they get ridiculous finger
prints though and sure enough they do
hence the cleaning cloth that comes
included of course time will tell how
well the quality of this finish holds up
I can't imagine that the paint would
scratch off that easily and of course
once you install these modules you're
pretty much not coming in contact with
them very often so that shouldn't be
much of an issue but why don't we go
ahead and open the
the box here's to see what the silver
looks like and silver I think I'm a
silver fan wifey sauce is shaking her
head no she likes the gold more I think
yeah yeah she smile and she likes the
gold so to each their own looks or
subjective who knew here comes the
ceremonial plastic peeling oh yeah I'm a
silver fan I'm a silver fan it's
probably also fairly obvious to you guys
that these are very reflective heat
spreaders I mean they're basically
mirrors you got mirrors on either side
of the stick which some people are gonna
like some people won't but at the very
least they're gonna be highly reflective
of any other lights that are in your
system so if you got an RGB graphics
card and RGB strip in there this is
gonna be bouncing that light off like
crazy all right now I got a level with
you guys I'm actually been holding out
on you because g.skill sent me one more
thing besides these two kits and I
wanted to sort of surprise you guys with
it right now
I actually don't know what it is myself
but it's this thing I would have to
imagine it's it's another memory kit
maybe a larger one with more dims hoping
for a hundred and twenty eight but I'll
take 64 let's take the sleeve off to see
if there's any specs on the box there
are no specs on the box however there is
a micro USB port what's happening here
what is this looks like there's a little
little pullout drawer what is it a
jewelry box okay we've got micro USB
cable and this Oh what is this Oh what
what what is this is like a display box
like a jewelry type of display box for
your memory I would imagine that g.skill
except this over particularly to the
reviewers so that they have a kind of
fun and easy way to display the new
modules rather than having to stick them
into a PC I don't think this is retail
well shoot I feel like it would be a
waste for me not to show this off to you
guys in full effects so let's light up
some crystal alright so I just plugged a
little battery pack in that seemed to do
the trick and here she is wah wah wah
stunning absolutely Gorge looks like
something that my mom would have on her
nightstand or something like that it's
ridiculous how over-the-top and
exquisite these modules look especially
in this display box but Dan they look
good IMO and as I expected these
crystalline caps are doing a great job
of hiding any LED hotspots while also
diffusing the lighting across the entire
stick very evenly and most of you guys
are probably familiar with the Triton Z
RGB modules that have been up for quite
some time now and very much like those
the LEDs on these sticks can be
customized individually per stick or you
can sync them across however many
modules you've got in your system
additionally the supports ASIS or a sync
as of now g.skill has said that they may
add support for other RGB software's in
the future but that hasn't been fully
confirmed just yet so there it is guys G
skillz tried at zero memory kits in your
choice of gold or silver which one do
you like more sound off in the comments
let's get a debate going of course to
let my opinions sway either way and in
case you're interested I'll drop some
links to these bad boys in the
description that's all for now guys
thank you so much for tuning in toss a

you really soon - make sure to turn
notifications on so you don't miss
anything coming up and I'll see you guys
