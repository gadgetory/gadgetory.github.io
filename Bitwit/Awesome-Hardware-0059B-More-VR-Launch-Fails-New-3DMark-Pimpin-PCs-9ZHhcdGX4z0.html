welcome YouTube and twitch alike this is
the live stream that Paul and I do every
single tuesday at five-thirty p.m.
pacific time right here on awesomesauce
network and awesomesauce hardware on
twitch and the hall and Paul's hardware
awesomesauce hardware no the
awesomesauce hardware nothing nothing
there is no exist don't look it up don't
try to find that place you won't um so
basically it can be confusing if it's
your first time we do a live stream
exclusively not exclusively I'm can but
to a twitch TV / awesome hardware both
sides of the show which is split up into
halves will be streamed there and then
they will be respectively reuploaded or
live streams respectively to each of our
YouTube channel which is Paul's hardware
and awesomesauce network yeah you can
find those on YouTube obviously and
that's pretty much it we have a couple
announcements that I wanted to go
through first of being first of which is
our merchandise so we are selling stuff
if you want to help support the channel
and you want to get some cool looking
shirts while you're at it I do have a
new cpu cooler heather navy shirt but
also more importantly is the bios flash
a shirt that one I'm just going with
what Paul's bring it up see if you kulla
Heather Navy okay cpu cooler Heather
navy shirts they're super comfy look how
Heather and Navy they're super heathery
yeah whatever that means they are super

a zero zero insertion force shirt which
is a flying off the shelves in two
different varieties as well Cindy that
the gray color as well as black so be
sure to pick one of those up as well and
you will get combined shipping orders as
well oh yeah if you guys order from both
of us if you guys so you wait we have
heard from a few of you that shipping
can be expensive we understand
this yeah actually John are but our
friend who does the Friends of storage
tributions life he has been talking
about finding some alternatives for
shipping that my brain down but if you
want to order from both of our stores
place the orders at the same time put a
note in there and you'll basically get a
refund for pride of the shipping and
it'll all ship together in the same box
yeah so so there you go so it won't be
so bad yes um but yes and you will be
getting a loud and proud Johnson shout
out I'm gonna go ahead and just give
some Johnson shoutouts you have a guest
episode might have that we happen to
miss so first off Randy Randy Johnson
shout out and yeah see you brother for
picking up a biosuit Randy Johnson the
Big Unit yeah yeah thank you for picking
up a bios flash ur shirt as well as Kyle
Kyle every time I see someone named Carl
I think of walking dead as he cop Carl
when Rick I know it was really sounded
like I said Kyle no no but bass the way
that Rick from the walking dead says he
goes Carl hell yeah Carl knows the way
he says it I was I always hated the way
he said his name um so thank you for
picking up a cpu cooler shirt in the
head of that Heather Navy as well also
even got Benjamin Benjamin gotcha
Benjamin gets a double johnson johnson
johnson it out Benjamin thank you sir
yeah and then you got some thanks um pub
glasses yeah and nails is that one of
mine what what yes this is a pulse
hardware exclusive pipe glass when you
can pick up from the pulse hardware
store very high quality um those are the
Johnson shoutouts that I have today yes
that's right I one for one more from
this morning thank you David David
Johnson uh I have one more from Gavin
yeah Gavin Jetson I know also picked up
a PO glass ooh it's good like I like the
pub glasses there they are nice they
hold a bit more than 12 ounce a they're
large it's a fairly dense glass you know
so they're pretty riddle Mia and the
printing that's on them is like it
stands up like you does you wash up the
crap out of him same with the mugs like
they're good quality yeah it stays on
there like it don't come off good
all right cool let's move on to our
first segment which is news just time
about some tech news here there's a
couple
are going on this week technology can
rog the first of which is a microsoft
and the things they've been doing to
their new blue screens of death this is
a busy busy web page yeah i don't like
how frantic this is looks a little bit
uh we need to turn ad blocker back on we
definitely do what it was over clock 3d
come on guys you gotta get away together
turn they got a whole page takeover
going on right now sem did a little big
launch is going on so microsoft has
added a QR code feature to their blue
screens of death or basically the the
little trouble shooting blue screens
that you get any time your system
crashes god forbid that should happen to
you very often but any time now a blue
screen will pop up in windows 10
specifically you will be also greeted
with a QR code that you can then scan
and it will take you to a microsoft page
then we'll give you like troubleshooting
tips and other you know possible
solutions to resolve that issue MSO
imagine if the blue screen of death code
is manually initiated crash it would say
don't manually crash your computer
that's probably the advice that it would
give you if you scan the QR QR code for
that one yeah i mean it seems like good
advice yeah anyway the stop code can be
lots of different things and depending
on what the stop code is it can give you
some deduction as to what your what
caused the crash in your computer right
but this actually kind of make sense to
me i mean if you're gonna have any
computer if you computer blue screens
you know you're gonna have to like copy
something down and type it into a
different computer a laptop or something
like that but most people will have a
smartphone sitting there mm-hmm QR code
and it takes you to the stop code for
the crash you'll just have to a quick
assign your camera if it isn't already
so that you you know you can actually
take a snap a picture of the the QR code
and scan it before your system reboots
yes unless Microsoft's changing that
around two if they're giving you like a
whole like minute or two well usually
it'll do it it'll do it dumped but
sometimes end up wit yeah you get a
couple seconds in there if you're
looking so if you receive here's a
disclaimer though quick
if you receive a be sawed with the with
a QR code in Windows 7 or 8 however it's
probably best not to scan it as doing so
will result in an automatic update to
Windows 10 what I'm totally
that's a clearly joke ok I just want to
scare you guys there for a minute it was
my laptop is now in windows text it's
almost unbelievable almost without it's
almost almost without me doing anything
yeah because I was like well that sounds
like it's totally something Microsoft to
do yeah right on the money so beware but
thank you microsoft for making life a
little bit easier for us I suppose next
up we've got a quick story on Pascal
shipping info and specs really quick I'm
just going to issue out a straw poll to
y'all um I'm curious to know who is down
for Pascale at the time of launch o.o
who's planning to buy a Pascal card as
soon as it's available yeah who's gonna
buy a Pascal card like the second it
launches I'm curious um this is the way
where'd that go I feel like the only
people who will be buying one are people
who haven't really had a graphics card
for you have been using the same card
for like maybe three four years or the
people who still have like a good you
know card from a year or two ago that
are just you know that that type of
enthusiasts level where they just they
want the newest which is pretty
much like the demographic you and I fall
into although it's kind of part of our
job too however there have been some
more details that have come to light
about the new generation of graphics
cards from Team Green including that
this is going down at computex they
are releasing this at computex in
June computex happens in Taiwan so we're
going to be seeing a lot of vendors on
the show floor at computex they're
probably going off that probably means a
day before competition probably the day
before you know but also throughout the
week I would think you know on the show
floor and stuff they're gonna have some
some 1080 users in 10 70s I
I would like to hope for but yeah the
 is coming it's right around the
bend right around the corner it's gonna
drop in July as far as like you know
massive volume shipments and we are we
are going to be seeing new video cards
that's the that's the the gist of this
story folks I have nothing else to
report somebody said your links are
broken your links are broken White was
well on this link I don't know this link
is perfectly fine it's truffle they're
tripping they're driven bow has no at
that I do live heah tripping balls huh
medic okay pals okay so i don't know i
mean gp100 is kind of a given i mean for
us to like you know do some proper
reviews on we have tell ya gp100 um and
how is it last year they released the
gtx 980 TI i believe during compy tax
that was that was the thing yeah what
nvidia likes to do is they do a press
conference that that like the evening
before computex starts yeah that's they
do it they do that at a at CES as well
with whatever stuffs that they want to
talk about but yeah right impression
excuse me the impression i'm getting
right now is that the big stories for
computex at least from intel and from
nvidia are going to be in cell broadwell
e yeah and 69 50 x yeah nvidia is going
to be pascal based GPUs beyond that we
don't really know like are they gonna
are they gonna come out of the gate was
a top in car died are they gonna I would
guess top end card like base um I'm not
having sex on the gp100 stuff that they
did at gtc and the workstation aspects
of it that kind of thing that seems like
what they're going for so yeah we'll
probably have like you know the new epic
spec for you know a desktop consumer pc
that you could build is probably going
to be x 99 6950 x and a four-way pascal
GPU configuration with whatever the
titan equivalent on Pascal according to
rumors in terms of like what the cost of
these components are going to be like 69
50 x
is rumored to be fifteen hundred dollars
yes and do you know what the gp100 is we
were to be right now I don't know either
but I I thought you're gonna but no I i
was i was vows in dollars yes it 50 i
was hoping you would know the answer to
that okay no I'm gonna have to guess
based on the past and just the trend of
the way things are going I would have to
guess it's like an eight-hundred-dollar
GPU at least oh yeah at the very least a
thousand easy well they will I mean I I
don't expect them to go too far away
from their currents like you know
product stack that they have increasing
every year though i don't i don't know
if they're gonna go for a more than
thousand dollar price point one the
thing is that the series the thing with
like a tightener tight necks they sell
it's weird to think about but they sell
yeah these thousand-dollar cards but
cards that are more performance cards
that are more than that like you know
when they tried to do the titans II you
know at three grand or whatever did not
sell as much so I don't know if there is
a market outside of like workstation
super heavy lifting graphics cards that
are made for workstations and don't even
work for gaming I don't know if there's
a market for fifteen hundred dollar plus
graphics cards for gaming systems so I
would expect them to kind of keep with
their same lineup that like they already
have like a thousand dollar ish Titan
class card and then a you know six or
seven hundred dollar cut down cut down
version of that you know with some spec
that's significantly less you know like
with the tight necks you've got 12 gigs
of vram versus an IT I was 6 or whatever
um yeah i mean that's that's what i
would expect from them but i would hope
I would hope that it's you know the
prices aren't like skyrocketing with
this generation I hope it's about the
same 1500 for your 6950 X 4 grand for
your 4p 100 based gaming GPUs decent
system for 10 to 500 plus whatever you
want to spend on motherboard memory
power supply storage case which if you
win the fractal giveaway that we're
doing right
now then you can buy was already a
thousand dollars to Oregon we can buy
one thousand dollar graphic card or all
the rest of the components for your
exact Lee exactly some very exciting
stuff I'm looking forward to seeing how
this all pans out but why do we move on
to our next story which is about the
oculus rift and you want to see what
people yeah I gotta fly I jazz I guess
who knows geez Kyle who cares this was
your half of the show yeah you know what
carry me all right this is he
desk who's who's going to ask out your
alien sis I'm so relaxed and at ease now
I'm not happening I think about that i
can pay attention to these allegiance to
that link clicker and yes exactly not me
who's getting pascal most of you are
saying no Wow most of you aren't 30 you
say no little less than a third you say
maybe me twenty percent say you and
fewest of you the music your server is a
very scientific poll not me maybe me you
me is option hey now people have been
very reciprocated of these of this poll
so uh thank you for saying those votes
apparently many of you are holding off
now now that may wins um a lot of you
guys are being patient and I'm sure
what's the pricing and the actual
performance of these cards come out then
maybe that those rules will change a bit
who knows but ok let's move on to our
next door patience is the mother of
Boris of inventiveness that is a that
you make that quote up is that just
something that you just said right now
are you quoting some other old guy so
wise it's a wise old axiom a wives tale
a wise like old wives tale beautiful
let's talk about oculus rift more VR
updates for VR fails um so if you guys
pre ordered a rift you might have gotten
a message or an email from the oculus
team confirming that your shipment for a
rift headset is still delayed and
perhaps even more delay than it was
previously oh this is the window that I
have
oh yeah yes I got the 523 262 window
okay I got 66 to like 16 okay so i am
just just barely which which really
won't matter cuz when it arrives i'm
going to be a computex and mia true true
good point but we know you're anxious to
receive your oculus rift and apologize
for not updating your order status
sooner rue you if you guys such a
heartfelt email though they seem so
apologetic they're like all right cuz
they could play it either way they could
play it the way if it's like no we're
right you guys are wrong just hold your
 together don't stop freaking out go
jerk off to some mechanical keyboard
like you nerds do or we can go the
completely apologetic route and just be
so overly sorry about every little thing
and that's the route they've chosen
because i think the the backlash has
been so great on their end that they are
really suffering some blows right now
and everyone in chat hates the are right
now everyone in check our sake r is the
past yeah not the future vieras awful I
here and I honest opinion I mean
although I already already said this on
my half of the show but I'll say it
again they I think that they were not as
upfront about their supply chain
problems as they could have been I think
they knew stuff before they let the
public know but i think they held back
and worked as communicative as they
could be because of the HTC vive launch
happening at the same time and they
wanted to prevent as much as possible
people from getting like our people from
getting the idea like Oh oculus isn't
going to be ready i'm going to order an
HTC vive yeah but yeah but now the
blowback they're getting from that is
people who ordered oculus and
pre-ordered it they're saying like well
i pre-ordered this in good faith faith I
didn't hear anything from you guys for a
very long time and you know wasn't and
when I finally did hear from you it was
like oh it's been pushed back two months
and you know just they weren't they
waited too long
do it and now as much as I say sorry you
know it's just it's frustrating to deal
with so yeah yeah it's like a game of
chess between oculus and HTC to kind of
be the first pioneers to get their
product out to the masses and start
shipping units but yeah I think maybe
you're right maybe maybe I culous kind
of preempted and you know in an attempt
to preempt HTC perhaps made some
promises they couldn't keep what ya is
quite unfortunate for the rest of us
however hopefully you guys have your
issues resolved if you happen to have a
pre-order for either of these headsets
that's been put on hold hopefully you
can get that resolved and still maintain
your order in line for that pre-order
because that would really suck let's say
let's say you did pre-order a riff
though and you find out that your
shipment has been delayed like three or
four months or something horrible like
that you still have the option to
contacts oculus or go on their website
and cancel your pre-order and you don't
get charged or anything there's nothing
there's no penalty or fee for that
however if you're not one to take
matters into your own hands then the
folks over at HTC will be more than
happy to cancel your order for you
without your permission though are you
sailing into the next door an
acquaintance of it okay where I did not
the girl I was a very rough segue there
I wanted I want well I wanted to bite my
bits dropped a donation I wanted to say
thanks thank you bite also by my bits
freaking he has a video on you as a
channel he has a video and he is
actually a few videos on freenas and
stuff and I I used his video on my
friend asked for you to teach me how to
do freenas stuff so yeah you guys check
out his channel he does some good stuff
but thanks for the donation by my bits
she's asking why we chose rift over vibe
and actually we both got both right we
did we both have ordered both we don't
discriminate yeah I'm not get all the
hair I am not necessarily choosing one
over the other I wanted to have both to
try them both to review them both and
provide comparisons to people via videos
and stuff so yeah I i would probably you
know if i had to choose right now i'd
probably go with the vibe because i've
had some
experiences and demos and stuff that
I've been able to try it with it but I'm
the only thing I've tried but what I
would want to say is like I'm not going
to choose until I'm until you try both
hands on tight el reno more time with
them and all the setup and all that
stuff anyway yeah I agree so HTC vive
okay so what I was saying is uh there's
there's been some kind of issues with
HTC as well oculus isn't the only one
that's struggling here with their huge
launch with their headset so basically a
lot of people that that have pre-ordered
the HTC vive have reported that their
orders have been canceled essentially
unbeknownst to them and the reason here
lies in with HTC's payment processing
system and also customers banks various
customers banks which have caused the
automatic cancellations for a lot of
these pre-orders so the the payment
system that HTC is using to handle all
these orders is digital river which is
pretty popular and customers have been
receiving emails from HTC urging them to
address their payment issues update
their payment information however those
who missed that email or didn't reply to
it like immediately like within the
first 12 24 hours have had their orders
for the rift I'm sorry for the vibe
cancelled automatically so if you were
asleep when that that freaking email
came through sorry you're not getting
rid of I've any more that's pretty short
and very short back immediate newegg for
example just because I have history
working in retail over there yeah if
newegg tries to charge an order that
you've placed and it doesn't go through
they'll charge it for three days and
send you an email every time mm-hmm so
that's that's like a good procedure for
this type of thing hey we tried to
charge this card didn't go through
what's up can yep you know contact us an
update your information three days you
know yeah most people would have enough
time to post bond with that amount of
time 12 hours is a pretty short window
yeah I can actually speak to this
directly though you were affected I've
ordered both the rift and the vibe and
the payment method that I used when I
place the orders back
in February the card well there was a
the cards not doesn't work anymore they
had to reissue my card so basically the
payment information I gave for both
orders had to be updated right uh with
oculus I was able to go directly under
their website and update just via the
portal and that's updated yeah and HTC
vive had to contact customer service
directly excuse me right and they were
able to help me out and I'm just like
they talk to someone they used a chat
but okay but yeah that regard well I
mean at least at least that worked out
for you and you got that resolved and
without too much trouble I hope yeah I
mean it wasn't too bad i mean i was like
i'm anticipating these and i knew my
card had had you know had to be
reassured and also it's kind of I I was
more proactive in dealing with it I
guess yeah but if you were in a
situation where you weren't then it
would suck to get another you know if
you got a notification at 10pm you know
and you had gone to sleep and then he
woke up and rent white went right to
work the next day and didn't check your
email till later in the day and I just
cancelled after 12 hours a lot i would
suck pretty bad yeah especially to lose
your lot ear or your place in line when
right now i think july august now is
when new orders are supposed to be
fulfilled is crazy so yeah yeah so
that's assuming they don't have some
kind of like component component
shortage like oculus did yeah well the
way they've been talking if they do they
damn well better let people know like
immediately when it happens yeah cuz
they haven't been like talking
directly on oculus but they've
definitely said a few things about like
our stuffs get a ship in the month we
told you it was going to ship right you
know exactly I think it's kind of by
them in the ass now so okay so there's
that let's let's go ahead and shift
gears to our next story which is about
3dmark a little bit like more
lighthearted no one's getting screwed
royally from from this article
so yeah the new benchmarking suite or
the the tried-and-true benchmarking
sweet i should say has a new update
pretty major one by the way all I don't
know if you've seen this but 3dmark
looks a little bit different now I
haven't it has a new UI that's a bit
more user-friendly it's also giving you
some recommended benchmark tests based
on your individual system specs so it's
like I you got a shitty rig you should
probably run this test your system can't
pan handle all the other good it's
also got modular updating which is
really nice so users can now install and
update individual benchmark tests
independently of each other so you have
to wait for this massive 3dmark sweet
update if you just want to update 3dmark
firestrike go ultra for example okay so
that's nice and you've also got access
now at least for the advanced and
professional edition owners you have it
you have access to the vr mark preview
so the vr mark is essentially the vr
benchmark by future mark here in the
3dmark sweet and it allows you to its
it's an interactive VR experience where
you can kind of just either put your
heads on your Rifter vive headset just
mostly what it's compatible with or you
can just watch your monitor you don't
need a headset though it is recommended
so it's an interactive benchmark in a
way where you can essentially explore
two different scenes that have been
created by a future mark the first scene
is kind of more on the light side so
even if you have like a mainstream
budget rig or an entry-level system I
think it's follows the minimum spec
requirements of the oculus rift so if
you I guess it's not entry-level if you
have like a GTX 970 you can pretty much
enter that first scene and explore the
VR preview test for yourself and the
second scene is a more high-end
experience if you're if you're rocking
like a GTX 980 I or you know Theory X
for example something like that and
unfortunately right now the VR the VR
preview does not spit out a bunch a
benchmark score which is too bad but
then I know better you won't know you
won't know Paul it's just strictly for
the experience if you want that doesn't
doesn't even count as a benchmark then
no it doesn't it doesn't really but it's
a it's white to preview it's a benchmark
preview so you're gonna debt cupcake
you're demolishing that cupcake every
time I look at that cupcake and get
smaller in mine mine because I've taken
a bite my only thing it's not like I've
eaten that much less than you have I
know whoa yeah you're right you're right
you got very right no cuz my my cupcake
is melting it's melted and it's it's now
half as thick as it used to be that is
science it's impossible as science and
scientifically proven um okay so uh
3dmark this is probably bigger news for
those of you who actually benchmark your
systems regularly um you know or do that
sort of thing what are you doing I've
never used any tests in 3dmark or at
least the current version of 3dmark than
fire strike by droid ultra well that's a
version of fire strike okay I'm saying
that's the only test I ever run extreme
or ultra they have other tests that are
like you know the oval their lesson
tested intensives are made for mobile
were made for you know systems with
integrated graphics yeah just I've never
touched any of those neither am i I
probably don't though I don't mean to
sound I hope that doesn't really sound
elitist uh cough I'm a dick I'm sorry
what an asshole a douchebag comment i
just made i'm sorry i didn't mean two
sided not even my hand I don't mean to
talk down on the other tests I didn't
that wasn't that wasn't my intense
although I was just trying to point out
that when you were like oh you can
download one test while the others do
not worry about the other tests and all
I was thinking all the time was like
I've only ever used one sound like your
time down the test you're talking about
the people who run the test the testes
hoping I mean I'd make you laugh pitch
is my success all right well I no harm
no foul as they say so good stuff all
around from 3 mark glad to see that
they're reinventing the wheel they're
making improvements to the UI and stuff
so let's move on to our last article for
this segment which is news and Jesus we
have been spending some time here yes we
a new Tsar this new segment but we are
this is this is it the Hat like your
video it's cuz you have so many goddamn
notes I know mostly to really notes the
notes are good okay after you doing too
much application they have their own
Mayhem's fluids there they are now
advising their users on how to avoid
color changing fluids in the future so
many folks have claimed that certain
coolants all right let's be honest here
Jay this is all directed at j okay
continue continue it yes yes it is so
many folks have claimed that certain
coolants in their custom water cooling
loops have changed color over time
mayhem's the coolant company attributes
this problem to the soluble flux that's
used when manufacturing water cooling
chemical reactions to some fluids I got
your soluble flutter actually I misread
that they've ribbiting it to the soluble
flux that's used when manufacturing
water cooling radiators that that
haven't been properly cleaned uni
there's use a malleable flux that you
know Lee aligned with the get a flush
the radiator you're gonna flush it you
gotta flush it so um the fluxes are
known for 30 minutes to have a chemical
reaction to some fluids 30 goddamn
minute 30 goodness changing the color of
Mayhem's lighter fluids such as get this
fall known to change the color of mayhem
slider fluids such as yellow orange and
red who do we know who had some Mayhem's
fluid in their system that was yellow
and changed color to orange in the past
Oh two three months and went for it went
from yellow to yellow to orange like
like brick Bridget changed a brick
 color is that where they got the
phrase I'm gonna a brick yeah that
was from thats as it gets the color when
you should yeah so are our good buddy
and friend and person who crashed our
stream last week
j from chase two cents had this exact
issue with Mayhem's fluids and he did a
bunch of videos on this you can go check
it out in Jays to sense James that's Jay
Z with a Z at the end it's not Jay Z the
rapper but yeah so he's had some issues
in these contacted Mayhem's and finally
they looks like they've actually issued
an advisory for users to actually a
guide on how to properly clean out that
flux from your radiator to avoid any
unwanted fluid color change something so
thank you mayhems for addressing that
issue um it seems a little bit late from
the time that Jay was having this issue
with them but I guess I don't know oh we
should have had a special guest Jake I
am Joe too important to be fair I'm sure
this is big to give his two cents more
than just JB yeah he'll he'll gladly do
that I bet it was sparked by jada that's
his specialty it's definitely sparked by
Jay this guide was sparked by Jay you
spark Jay what the like they wouldn't
imagine this advisory never mind never
mind never mind we're all look kind of
creepy innuendo you're never my ring to
Paul never mind what you just said never
mind you are thinking okay all right
lawton heavy hardware honey oh oh we
have a new segment are we done with the
first segment of the shows we are it's
only set that's the longest segment by
far though I was insane belong your
segment by far what's next Navy hardware
heavy hey hey Thank You Jordan for the
donation and poor jay Lisa's got the
company to acknowledge the issue yes he
did you know he's got some social reach
there so I'm glad that they do did
acknowledge it well done also Connor
thank you for the donation what does
this button do oh so that's what it does
yes you figured out how to donate
congratulations and Kevin would you guys
consider doing a collab video for two
hmds of course why not that's a great
idea I would love to do a collab video
in VR okay maybe I'll invite you over to
my my Steam theater we should you know
we should try to do we should try to
have you and I be guests on Will Smith's
VR talk show this will smith hum of your
talk show the
why wasn't that one of your awesome
hardware stories today cuz it's from
last week it's old news really I don't
know why how I missed that is it because
he did I robot and a bunch of other
futurist in exist hey gorgeous I hate
you right now why I look there's more
Will Smith's in the world than Will
Smith who did I robot and mom if you if
you just say Will Smith without any kind
of explanation then no no sir Inc no sir
what look look at will look up will
smith on Twitter who who's will smith on
twitter look look who will Smith is Will
Smith I'll be willing to bet you at
somebody who many of our fans are
familiar with who is this guy that is
actual Will Smith sad husband CEO of a
foo VR what is he's done lots of stuff
he used to work for maximum pc he did
tested for a very long time he's very
well known in our space and I can accept
segev accepting you're not very familiar
with him but but is there even Will
Smith on twitter there is like Will
Smith the actor yes his pro super bowler
superbugs hey I that's I will smith I'm
saying the Will Smith no but his name is
Will Smith yes because there's lots of
will smith's in the world it's not a
very uncommon name but but not many will
smith's get posted to the top of the
search engine optimization in twitter if
you just type in Will Smith yeah we're
talking about the top one percentile of
will smith's okay and who comes up will
smith this is pro Super Bowl
champion which neither of us knew about
so clearly there are way more Will
Smith's in the world then either of us
are capable of knowing he is four
hundred thousand subscribers or
followers and I've never even heard of
the damn guy other than the Sports two
sports is a boiler date what is it I
don't even super bowl champion whatever
he's gonna hot wife when I wrote here
plays football professionally anyway
anyway my point my point is right back
point when you cover the type of content
that you and I cover saying Will Smith
without any context i'd say i'd say you
could easily argue that one's mind might
go more so to the will smith from tested
and formerly of maximum pc then will
smith the actor who really has nothing
to do with technology by and large we we
just did a segment exclusively on
cupcakes on your half of the show i
believe that's true you to say it's
outlandish for me to think the Will
Smith you're talking about on this text
show is Will Smith the famous actor is a
little bit far-fetched boy on cake man
you bringing the cupcake man i'm gonna
eat more of my cupcakes because i am so
hungry right now this sounds so
delicious so good i like eating the
pretzels off the edges hmm wish crunchy
oh my god so good why did you bring
these did Diana like make you yes she
told me she's like me what she can bring
couple to put on the show and I was like
okay I know you didn't do it willingly
know it was the wife it's always the
wife it's like hey take take this away
from me first I was like okay I can do
it and then when I was really running
short on time I was like how to make a
segment out of these cupcakes that's how
that started were you just on the way to
my house like I'm gonna make a segment
at you know I thought of it earlier
today yes all right I'm heavy hardware
on Debbie all right we were just loud
abuse this segment for the ten minutes
let's plow through these lien lien new
SFX a dash l powers my eyes are small
551 751 you wat modular cables kill a
black silent fan why do you even need an
F sub X power supply 750 plots I
don't understand you leave one pcie
lameness that most of the time sound
pretty good you know you're not going to
ever have like a multi-gpu configure
there anyway what it's made for is for
small form-factor dual-gpu configuration
not not dual graphics card but to GPU
graphics card setups where you want to
have plenty of power for a high-end GPU
or high-end cpu as well as
GPU graphics card as well as enough for
everything that might go in the case but
is so many ITX but ninety-nine percent
of cases that have SFX support are going
to be mini-itx which means you only have
one pcie slot yeah which is all the way
all like GPU a to GPU graphics card they
do still exist oh I see what you're
saying wait a dual GPU like seven or
nine ninety or a getter Titans e yes
okay sure there's not a lot of very
movements there's not a lot of very
compelling dual GPU graphics cards out
there right now but there might be I
don't know that there are I know nothing
205 x2 I would say he's probably the
most popular 5 x2 and even then you need
a mini X you needed me THX case that can
support the aio cooler on that thing so
that's another thing that's no that's
true but but I wouldn't be surprised to
see I mean I Freddie on pro duo radium
from duo yeah just announced yeah this
if you wanted to put a radeon pro duo in
a small form factor system this would be
the power supply to use true okay but
they already have them stones it's ever
gonna be quick let's do the next thing
all right we're releases the carbides
makes I'll brush because just fans today
game it's ugly the first name acoustic
mama the first new gaga okay Detroit
that got a smash between two to the
trash called Star Wars killa fire so Ben
never getting an endorsement of course
there ever go corsair hates us now but
they make really good products just just
what I'm not personally a fan in the
aesthetic um they should they should
this yes Michelle doesn't see yes it as
late as does like late how did this
Salman case get drunk okay I'm sorry I'm
sorry it's true that is so true nobody
nobody bad
blame you blatantly tell you guys don't
buy this thing I'm sure it has this is
certain there's a certain demographic a
certain that's gonna love it sure mark
look at George there's George I know
actually I know where he filmed this
i've been i've been to the set I've been
to the set here where they filmed this
anyway there's George explaining he's
like look Oh looks good Georgia sadie is
like I didn't really want to make this
case he's like look we need something
edgy we need something for the gamers
out there gamers like edgy like this and
put some weird angles on the front of it
the jars like all right look I like
making a cases I put a lot of effort
into this and this was the best I could
come up with they told me I couldn't
change the front of it I really wanted
to change the front I wanted to make it
look nice but like no we got to stick
with this so here's all the things I did
to make this case actually passable
unusable despite okay I secretly work
for deep cool they paid yet in sizeable
mad money big cases look good so sorry
look at that entail okay internal layout
though I mean it at least it looks like
you if you if you only look at the
inside it's a it's perfectly normal
computer internal layout is fine yeah
it's fine well that drive support $99 no
I don't know how much it is you don't
know how much no i don't not sin it's on
the budget side though if you look at
the drive cage it's definitely on the
budget side right um okay next up that's
fun was it fun should be first in fresh
like no like need to find more product
so we just immediately don't like that
was more like that was our best reaction
yeah i mean forget the trailers that we
watched really that was like our initial
reaction the whole thing Thank You Leon
for the domain I did the center George
have a couch of baby oil Paul mmm I'm
it's mainly a large kind of open empty
space and they've set up some sets and
like various corners of it that's a
different
yes yeah so baby oil everywhere alright
steelseries launches their apex m500
esports keyboard featuring Cherry MX red
switches they're going exclusively with
red this time around you do get blue LED
/ key lighting brightness and breathe
settings of course red switches and blue
LEDs I know I know might as well get
some purple dogs and cats cents in their
living together I get height-adjustable
rubber feet steel backplate
anti-ghosting 140 rollover don't know
who has ever needed that mass hysteria
supports key assignment on the fly
macros with unlimited profiles that can
automatically launch when loading
certain games nine dollars okay hundred
bucks um in my opinion mechanical
keyboard Danny keyboard uh 100 bucks I
would expect at least RGB and I know I
don't mean that like RGB customization
like 16 million colors I just mean red
green blue those are the three big ones
in my opinion if you can make your
keyboard red green or blue and like
switch between those I feel like a
hundred bucks should entitle that by now
that should entail at least a couple
different color options as opposed to
just blue if you're if you want to sell
a bunch of units if I was making
keyboard I wouldn't want it to just be
one color because that limits your your
demographic your your target audience
Sarah um is there a function you don't
see a function key cuz I see some media
controls may give me the steelseries
keep it that looks like a Windows key as
well well no cuz there's a Windows key
over here that has a windows logo maybe
that is the function key so this is a
function key right then you got some
basic media controls yeah it's like a
pretty standard layout right this is a
plastic housing plastic housing like
supposed to be super durable and all
that sort of think it's very minimal
like very slim bezel and all that sort
of thing so it kind of reminds me of the
rosewill mechanical keyboards in a way
very slowly to the RK series though
they'll discount this to 75 or 80 bucks
around holiday time and it'll sell okay
alright yeah alright moving on to pin my
pc they've got five of you guys that we
got to check out missy uh first off
we've got squiz do
we just do a helping brands your name
right um all right come up a site all
right you've got dual configuration here
for your graphics cards I believe those
are 9 v's you can't tell might be oh
yeah 8980 eyes yeah ties and 4770k 16
gigs of ram is the 97 crate edition
motherboard from em aside and h100i GTS
okay define s beautiful case um the
cables are killing me right now honestly
the ketchup and mustard I can't I can't
really right here I don't feel like
ketchup and mustard this is probably one
of the few systems where I've seen red
and yellow cables but where supply is
this yeah with with tuna listed with 29
ati's nope no listing of the power
supply he's ashamed he is a shame he's
ashamed of his music school yeah I'm
gonna leave that one out is this you'll
just uh no they don't need to know they
don't even know what it is it looks like
a POW max it's a packed house of POW max
power supply h NW I've never seen okay
hnw it's not close enough to look at the
rail layout or anything like that shoots
flames out the back I here yeah mostly
um alright just get a new power supply
and just leave your cables get some
extensions or get a power supply that
has all black cables I mean if you don't
want to spend money on extensions or
whatever that's how you just get a power
supply that has all back black cabling
and a power supply upgrade would be a
very reckless is what is the wattage six
pit no now i think it's an 800 watt
rated power supply but it's not any plus
though it's not 80 plus but a shitty 800
watt power supply with 29 ATT eyes on it
Jen she uh yeah I mean I did yeah that's
definitely overclocking definitely the
weakest link in this system that's what
I would look to upgrade it would see too
often I would
change that though I would help your
aesthetics that would help your my my
your peace of mind your peace of mind
for long term life of the system other
than that I mean the gold accents on
these 980 TI SI have one of these nine
ATT is it's a very nice card they have
gold accents it's really hard to match
yeah if the cables are replaced it
wouldn't look too terrible III don't
know what you can do about that but I'm
than that nice build yeah get new Paris
fly squeeze my cables alright thanks
thanks cuisines always do Stephanie next
time we got that ebony all right so um
it's awesome looking at your your side
picture here I really like this actually
I love the fact i love the color scheme
it's kind of like barney colors but it
doesn't look super you know shitty or
anything you kind of got like a gray
purple and the lime green kind of an
nvidia green and you have led accents
scattered throughout your system that
represents each of those colors so like
you've got the purple fans of the front
you've got green LED accents by your
motherboard and on your GPU I think it
looks great um the thing i would say
here and it even looks like is that
spray painted purple a cover on the on
the the water block yeah that that
removable ring might have been modified
that's pretty color i like that i
haven't seen very much of us that's very
nice i like the thought that went into
that um what i would say here
immediately off the bat this looks
excellent i really like the stephanie
however if you wanted to just give it
that extra touch of class and
matchy-matchy pneus i was saying get
those same color sleeve cables for your
24-pin ATX and i believe you might have
mentioned that this was already
something that you had going like you
were waiting on that cable i think once
you install that and you replace you
swap it out its gonna look absolutely
fantastic this is a be 150 mother would
be one fitty i've not heard of or seen
this movie before and it's a sniper
series she was measured a seven
interesting okay sorry i was i was so i
was interested in that yeah okay yeah so
I mean once you get that cable in there
um i would also try to tuck away that
that fan cable that's coming off of your
aio I think maybe just kind of like tuck
it a little bit more behind your video
card just so it's not just dashing out
in front I'm kind of stealing the show
they're a little bit but and maybe peel
the sticker off your SSD just to clean
it up a bit because the red doesn't
really mesh well with with the other
colors but other than that nice bill and
I like the color scheme a lot did you
say to paint the SSD hesitation just
does it take to stick around what take a
problem whatever you want to do with the
SSD that's what stands out yeah yeah
nice build up I like the color team like
the like the custom sleep cables at
least the extensions for the graphics
card nice job Stephanie well done uh
that it asked the next time we've got a
dev chair the chair I have to say out
the uh I 340 150 gtx 745 and OEM
what okay I don't own a gig assets d 1.6
gigs of various hard drives 14 gigs of
ram how do you get 14 gigs of ram that's
gotta be a typo no he said 14 gigs
impossible impossible not impossible you
just need what do you need for that you
need to two sixes and then not 28 word
no wait 14 it you need an 8 a 4 and a 2
yeah to it says does he have three
sticks of ram oh no you need an 8 a 4
and a 2 I would think
does that be 14
that's the only way for two couldn't do
6 an 8 because that's not those did
those divisible don't work on the same
platform is okay oh my head yeah dude
this reminds me of weight have one at
one point back in the pentium four days
i think i had like seven hundred and
sixty eight gigs there megs of ram or
something like that now so confusing
that's like why binary we've got people
in Chad haven't had been happy to help
me get there till I guess who got 4433
you're gonna four four four two eight
two two two that's just weird weird
configuration maybe he's got some three
gig sticks of ram I know 2224 gig sticks
and two three gig sticks that's what I'm
Becca and what are those three gig
memory for instance maybe there's two
Louie there's four sticks in there maybe
it is four four four two I really hard
to say it is okay all right let's let's
let's move on for that let's move on all
right overall we have um the obvious cut
ketchup and mustard cables you got some
red cabling here in your SATA going on
for your hard drives down at the bottom
you've got the legacy device issue that
just I mean they're functional pieces of
hardware but the more often I see them
to older they look yeah hard drives that
aren't hidden tucked away back somewhere
looking less less appealing to me
granted I'm being very picky here yeah
of course five and a quarter inch
optical drives in particular those never
looked good no they're just big gray
boxes that don't match with anything
it's like cardboard um and do you need
two optical drives I don't know what do
you need optical drives for these days
if you have a blu-ray burner i'll give
you that if you got a blu-ray player
i'll give you that you have a combo
driving no one no one no one should have
any need for two optical drives anymore
i feel like you really copy from one
optical drive to another maybe he does
do you really do a blu-ray playbook
playback while you
rip a CD or something like I don't know
he's a pirate yarr I feel like a single
blu-ray burner I'm okay with yeah I
understand the utility of that but I
feel like that should get everything
done that you needed to be done so right
i don't know maybe you could pull one of
those out you bloody don't look bad the
red doesn't look bad either corsair
power supply dick your sticker could be
removed sure you got lots of cables
because you have really you have tons of
drives connected so those could be
cleaned up right um that's what uh maybe
think about a new case how is this fan
here embedded into part of his optical
drive am I seeing this great great all
right his his second and third five and
a quarter inch Bay look like they have
optical drives in them right yeah okay
and then look at the second picture i
see this hundred and twenty millimeter
fan appears to be appears to have begun
meshed its begin to meld crash with the
optical drive to become one one
component somehow that have been out
that's what any my photoshop
it's gotta be photoshop to my pc usually
isn't this confusing it's a good
photoshop job in that like the shading
in the color it's not photoshop though
it's there all the pictures that met fan
no i mean it whether i guess it is yeah
it's there at all the pictures in this
site may be photoshopped all the
pictures oh come on that's a maybe he
just really wonder photoshop that fan
this is tough so I'm so singularity in
the optic ultra like I could see it
being somebody suggested it maybe it's a
500 inch fan fan mounts I've seen those
before but the rest of it looks like an
optical drive it looks like there is a
standard
five and a quarter inch it doesn't make
sense oh I'm right all right let's move
on what if it's hollowed out no do you
think it's like no I haven't a
quarter-inch thing that's hollowed out
in the back that I think he has the
better it does make fun I think we need
to move on let's move on let's move on
thank you a pot to make you potty dep
cheer for confusing the out of I
don't know what the hell is going on
believe anymore Zach 4790 k 4.7
gigahertz 970 SSC 16 gigs of kingston
memory 500 gig and hundred and twenty
gig SSDs and a one terabyte hard drive
not much to really complain about here
um i like i like the black and white
theme I like the black and white classic
uh memory of that that's cool a little
tighter every other memory there was a
black in the white alternated there a
bit yes Luminati confirmed I think
things that I would improve here is your
pcie cables like a little bit
disoriented those could use some
training for sure or or get the you know
the cable combs you have to pop in there
if there are lost cause then just get
some new ones because it might just be
easier for you in the long run and also
if you want spice things up a bit I
would suggest getting another one of
those corsair AF series fans I with the
white trim on it but the wipe option
bracket and putting that in the rear
exhaust because I think that would look
really nice having more you know I don't
know having two of those fans side by
side with the gang white trim and the
same vibration pads on the corners I
think that would look really cool leave
more uniform but own that looks pretty
sweet I get yourself find your missing
expansion slot cover and put it in why
is that why is it missing get pop that
back on there find that it's probably in
your your hamper yeah it's bright
surprise somewhere but also put your
clothes in the hamper don't just judge
just throw your jeans of the floor it'll
be a slob Zack the hampers right there
Zack it's right there all you had to do
is open the hamper and put the genes in
okay so you're right there it's very
close okay one more
this is 50 was exciting mattresses are
like it hey you put stuff in the
background of a photo oh yeah it's all
your fault Anthony coming back at it
with another CX 500 m power supply this
is like every at it again everyone with
the CX 500 m power supply take the
goddamn stickers off yes unless you're
almost you have a green thing system all
right okay first thing Anthony in this
system Hugh plus wait what oh he should
add a hue plus that would make
everything pop I'm just joking we don't
buy a sixty-dollar LED kit for this
computer yeah all right certainly your
fish to fry here yeah I'm your cabling
is not bad and I mean you're doing
you're doing what you can with it yeah I
I'm sorry for the visit I'm sorry for
the position of your USB 3.0 and the
motherboard none that nothing to be done
there you're suffering from the
motherboard darf ISM set the syndrome to
some degree because you have a micro ATX
board and a standard ATX eyes case I
hate clear fans from YouTube clear fans
are like clear heels oh you know that
just tacky only good if you're in a
strip club yeah uh your friends but yeah
I mean I know what's wait he does have
an LED in here yeah he does I did not
even notice that I read I is there any
other are there any other pictures oh
yeah yeah here just lit up actually with
it lit up it doesn't look as bad since
it's all red never does washing it
washes everything else else out a little
bit right um but in the daytime you want
to have some yeah you want it to look
nice too all right so I don't know what
what are your on so what's your low
hanging fruit here my main cpu cooler my
low hanging fruit here is definitely the
cpu cooler and the color mismatch so if
you rip off those power supply stickers
and maybe get some it stuff with a
budget system like this because in one
regard you want to be like just get some
sleeves extensions get to spend like 30
40 bucks on some black sleep schedule
it'll look a lot nicer but
30 40 bucks you can also upgrade some
much-needed improvements here with the
rest of your components where I'm like
okay you really need a better graphics
Carter you really need a new cpu invest
your money towards that first and then
worry about aesthetic so this is kind of
beyond pimping right now you're not
ready to be pimped is what I'm saying
you need to just upgrade your system I
think we can't in good conscience
recommend aesthetic upgrades for a
system when that money would be much
better invested towards just faster
Hardware exactly so at the very least a
very look I love when I like conceive of
a sentence in my head and I say it and
it just comes out right sorry i just
said have no no that was very like
you're right that I want articulate
 I said that clearly and
concisely all right despite the many
drinks that we've had mission
accomplished for the day quite an
achievement achievement unlocked um so
yeah okay if if anything uh-uh Anthony
here um I would swap out that AMD stock
cooler for something that's a little bit
more hyper 212 evo on that realm just
because I've dealt with the AMD stock
cooler a lot of us have its noisy a
when you're under load yep the intel
stock cooler is potato however it is not
nearly as noisy in my experience as the
AMD stock cooler maybe if you get even
if you got an AMD wraith cooler I've
heard that that's quieter but the basic
you know the old-school traditional
stock cooler from AMD is unbearable in
my opinion so I would go for that first
if we're talking small-time upgrade
improvements and then work your way into
maybe getting about more powerful cpu
and GPU I don't know exactly what your
specs are now if you list of them here
but um that's where that's where I were
to go for first don't upgrade your case
or or your RAM you know upgrade the meat
of your your hardware first go for the
CPU GPU so that's what I would have to
say groovy thanks Anthony and that
conclude fit my bc and because already
did QA on his half of the show we don't
do it on ours and that is going to
conclude this half of awesome hardware
probably yes thank you guys so much Paul
are you down to do an after party later
tonight
and a couple hours rdf some stuff to do
I ask you about that I I have stuff to
do unfortunately that's on I got it cuz
cuz the project does working on today I
didn't finish and I need to have it done
prior to us going to to this sublime
scientist a to get this weekend lot of
lances again Prem um I agree I am
probably not going to be able to do a
full nights after-party if anything I
might be on later tonight but I can't
make that promise just yet because um
there's a lot of that I gotta do
