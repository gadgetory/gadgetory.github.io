channel hope you're all doing well today
wife Lisa and I are doing something a
little bit different we had this crazy
idea to do sort of a 1v1 in csgo a game
that we both personally suck in very
much so I'll admit I'm a bit better than
she is just because I'm a bit more
familiar with FPS games in general but
we decided to switch things up during
this little 1v1 showdown so basically
she's going to be gaming on Hotline my
$5,000 custom water-cooled PC rocking
the 69 50 x10 core intel i7 processor q
gtx 980ti in sli and so forth along with
the predator X 34 34 inch you know 100
Hertz g-sync
IPS display peripherals up the wazoo all
the good stuff
whereas I will be gaming on this now in
its defense we actually have a pretty
good CPU in here it's an i7 4770k
however there are no discrete graphics
we're going to be running off of the
integrated shush I'm trying to film the
video here no discrete graphics card
we're going to be running off of Intel
HD graphics exclusively not just to play
the game but to also capture the
gameplay you're about to see with OBS so
that's going to drop the framerate I
would imagine even more in-game now the
monitor I'm using was actually really
good in its day but it's super dated now
it's an ace deuce I forget the VG 2 7 8
or something like that it was like 144
Hertz TN panel obviously no adaptive
refresh rate or anything like that but
it's a pretty decent size 27 inches
however I will be playing in windowed
mode at 1280 by 720 we've also got some
really crappy peripherals here we've got
a wireless membrane keyboard sound
stereo and this really crappy little
laser mouse that I got from RadioShack
maybe eight years ago it's it's really
bad it's really really bad so all that
said this should be an interesting an
interesting little showdown
don't you think honey are you ready you
ready to get smacked we're to get
smacked around so we're going to do here
is we're actually going to play three
different Maps five rounds each sorry
for the cars driving by out the window
five rounds each that gives us 15 we're
gonna do best out of 15 so that would be
the first player to win eight rounds
is going to be today's champion and then
the loser just up the stakes even
further is going to have to down a full
teaspoon of habanero hot sauce with
their only chaser after 60 seconds of
enduring the heat being a tall can of
natty ice oh boy it's going to be
glorious I really really hope that I
don't lose so that's it ladies and
gentlemen we're not taking things too
seriously here this is just a fun sort
of video for you guys to enjoy and make
no mistake due to that punishment
someone will be in a world of hurt by
the end of this video and we'll get it
all on camera I promise on that note
let's fire it up honey are you ready
that's a yes three two one but for the
job all right here we go our first map
is all day you can buy now you can't
really buy much on the first round
because you don't got no money got no
money honey you got to kill me if you
want some moolah come at me bro
come at me I am I met it I'm actually at
a pretty decent 30 frames per second
right now you're in trouble honey if it
wasn't for this god-awful mouse
keyboards bad - mmm I was testing out
another map earlier it might have been
militia or something that I was getting
like 22 frames per second performance it
reduce the performance and this maps
actually much better oh you got the hots
you're writing and everything oh my
goodness hard
I think we're guys alright that's me
this is a hard map I feel like like this
claw I mean I like I like close quarters
I'm higher about making you anxious I'm
really bad with long range so just get a
noob stake and just spray and pray oh I
can't even teabag you at this frame rate
so low 27 FPS the
do this a hostage being taken right from
under my nose
oh it's on now better tread lightly my
god you scared the crap out of me I did
yeah I'm going to be right there I'm
failing at this terribly no you're doing
all right you've been telling me
everything on how am i doing all right
that's true but you know what they say
don't give up yeah you know I think
you're going to do better in the next
map because the freight rates I'm
getting here are the highest I've seen
while testing this game on the system
all the other maps seem to have like way
more textures or something or maybe it's
the draw distance that drops the
framerate like well below 30fps this is
definitely the best performing map that
I've played so far so I'd imagine this
is probably things really going to pick
up for you from here are you even
listening to me
nope okay
Oh oh thank God you came out of nowhere
oh good Phoebus Jennifer rush park this
is the last round of this map yeah
making camp people why is it soft round
because we're doing five rounds per map
I definitely lose this one that's okay
if you can if you can manage to win this
one you'll be in good shape not too far
up we're still in still early there's
still q1 baby we're still in q1 oh hello
oh my god this mouth oh my god I think
we're out I had four couples you had
four hell yeah like breeze would have
knocked me dead okay all right so that's
that's five rounds about it we in Italy
yo ronamoon it should I knock up Enix
mystify that's some old it all right so
now i'm chugging along at around between
20 and 30 FPS it's it's chops video we
have reached chop ville mother of god
come on
26 FPS in the hall well darn well done
good kid yeah gonna kill you yeah can't
wait to kill you good okay yeah yeah
yeah
wait what oh yeah I hear you I hear down
keep down 22 fps in the house whoo by
the way I have a frame counter the steam
in game frame counter that you guys
cannot see kids not picking up in OBS
but I am keeping tabs on my frame rates
at all times
oh Jesus really
Wow Wow Wow whee
oh geez okay oh I bet it's how bad I am
at games because we should not have one
oh you have G think do you think come on
yes yes what that's right truth sorry
how'd you know oh my gosh I need to kind
of think - - for Italy this one's for
all the marbles
how you feeling right now honey I want
to think I'm gonna lose okay pretty
confident Alan's pretty confident that
you have over six thousand dollars worth
of hardware at your disposal I'm going
to lose I think I've probably got around
600 you literally have ten times the
amount of hardware that I do right now
the question is do I have at least ten
times the amount of skill oh no I don't
well that one goes to you honey
well done well played well played you
three you got three on that one all
right this is the third and final map
does
to brawled marbles again the score right
now is Kyle six Heather four first one
to eight wins everything oh honey come
out come out wherever you are
oh Jesus oh yeah what's up are you even
coming from oh yes oh no way
how is that even have you know 25fps
alright alright
and I did you and you did yeah thank you
yeah
alright well now I've got a big boy gun
I'm coming after you
but your girl girls shouldn't have
big-boy guns anatomically incorrect oh
my goodness what 25 per second joking oh
all right it is 6 to 6 ladies I'm scared
actually
you should be I'm a little nervous
myself I'm a wee Britain or rough you
know
oh no you only need one more yeah I do
yes I do I do even cares don't even know
one should spend more than $300 on a
gaming PC it's pointless seven to seven
oh my god this next round take all the
glory this next round is that oh my god
this is it I'm really I'm so nervous
gettin really scared actually it's
terrifying
