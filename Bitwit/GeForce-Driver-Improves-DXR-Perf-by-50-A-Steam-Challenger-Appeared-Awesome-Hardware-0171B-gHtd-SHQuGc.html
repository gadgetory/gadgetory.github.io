episode 171 I'd be if you missed side a
you can check it out on Paul's channel
Paul's hardware or youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware or you can find the link
in my video description this is a
technic News live show thing that pollen
I stream every single Tuesday at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time right here on Twitch
on TV / awesome hardware or our
respective YouTube channels which as I
sort of already alluded to is broken up
into two halves so Kyle made the news
[Laughter]
lousy sounds like something in our
Google Doc with a bitly link that I'm
afraid to click on link know what you
click on it maybe you should click that
into it
sure can you is it I mean I could what
even is it it just looks like is that
just a link to our stream anyway you you
continue doing that Paul area Walmart
Nicole tech spot or hello Walmart pulls
its overpowered gaming desktop PCs from
the sale following following quality
consist do we have already proven this
false that we proved this false on my
half of the show but maybe not entirely
because it is now updated with a newer
price ok well it is low Wow well hello
embedded right there Kyle's hey take
that gamers nexus is 2.6 million view
video yeah who's on the text box article
he wrote this text bar
what's up Cohen Cohen thanks for the
article yes thanks for featuring Kyle's
so appreciate it we're getting
immediately distracted wait wait wait
what this means is we need a breaking
news ticker at the bottom of our
breaking finally change other words so
and stuff like this comes in we are
ready we are ready for the for the
taking but yeah we're wait before we
dive into that sure we drink beer on the
show occasionally because yeah word of
warning and you should advise device or
service I have a new Blaster design for
for mouse mats as hoodies and we have
the new awesome hardware design that was
a fan made its glorious it's so cool I
like it I'm gonna buy one for myself
actually I'm you buy two mugs and do a
double blessing that who doesn't want
that great Paul store my button by the
way - Paul bit with tech tech and then
yours is Paul soccer net for me he also
sells some amazing things olive green
and quality classic thumbscrew logo and
all of green now available on Green Bay
both of our stores right now have
holiday sales if you're buying for your
loved ones for the holidays 10% off
orders over fifty twenty percent of
orders over 100 on both of our stores
and if you happen to buy awesome Harbor
stuff don't worry because we its we
split the profits for those so that's
that's really cool that's true also
shout out to our store manager John he's
awesome and we love him we love him also
a shout out to sell who's our good
friend moderator in chat yeah I'll be
nice to him or he will pen you and we
give him full authority to do so yes
also uh we have a charity lion hillary
charity let's charity livestream oh my
god
December 8th that's this Saturday in
four days four days holy smokes we're
gonna be doing a 12-hour charity
livestream Paul and I my gum just we're
just gonna be gaming for 12 hours
straight raising as much money as
freaking possible for for some kids in
need I think last year we raised over
$13,000 it's kind of crazy we could
raise that much money for actually sick
people by playing video games
the only real OHS my mind only reason we
can do that is because of the generosity
of the viewers at home
why of course and the only way that you
could do like help us anyway is to tune
in and tune in and sig member and to
give you guys a bit of an intent and
incentive a little bit of extra you know
possible reason to kick in hmm we're
gonna have actually three computers
three we're giving away three are you
giving away two I'm not giving away two
I'm giving away one so am i but the
second one was for NB 67
oh that's right yeah yes yes that's
right we had a fan meetup this past
weekend MB 67 aka lenticular yeah we
interact with him like during the show
and on all the time is names Mike he's
from San Diego he sent me a mini
computer and a damn case I haven't
picked up picked it up yet it's in my
p.o box but we're gonna get one exactly
Justin that's one section way assistant
I built yesterday
and then we're going to be giving away
it's just in the Kyle built already
built it nope I'll be there breathing I
will be giving away the dtw one wall
getting away the Walmart PC I'll be it a
modified one customized by myself to
make it infinitely better with a
revamped motherboard and some other
really nifty tweaks that I'll have an
idea I'll have a video out on that very
soon that's for the stream yeah
excellent it's it's a good PC now so
many reasons to join us and watch and
also enter those giveaways coming up on
Saturday and thanks to all of you guys
who do that December 8th December 8th
December 8th we will be screaming yeah
well we also will stream to awesome
hardware right here where you're
watching this you'll probably be able to
watch both streams there and then we're
also going to be individually streaming
as Kyle and I play on our individual
twitch channels to write my twitch
channels Paul's hardware mine's bit wit
KY KY ok someone else took bit with Kyle
screw them but we'll have links to all
that and then he means hello we're not
streaming to YouTube she's lying
I saw some other people saying ripped
friends maybe maybe she's lying
Vsauce you're such a liar I have a
computer Jeff uh yeah I mean people are
still commenting in chat and stuff so
it's my is this it's my laptop plug what
my laptop actually what the hell you
just restart this is that extension cord
a plugged into not actually that makes
me really think that I should have
another beer oh yeah what do you want we
got a fat tire
sam adams winter variety I'll take good
fat tire sure why not
alright um so uh yeah come out to the
stream we'd love to see you there and
there's gonna be hella prizes you for
the children
all right let's good luck our first
story here is from Nvidia themselves
from the horse's mouth about a new
battlefield 5 update an GeForce driver
that is going to improve DXR rate racing
performance by up to 50% this has been
all over the place on the web this
morning the windows update oh geez
always listening thanks computer I
wasn't using you right now or anything
at least it wasn't the streaming system
so today that actually launched a date
December 4th the doesn't work hasn't
been tested I don't know I don't know
about that but the battlefield 5 tides
of war chapter 1
overture update brings new single-player
war story and a new multiplayer map and
a bunch of other stuff but mainly it
includes the DX r ray tracing
optimizations that improve performance
up to 50% which which which also
suggests that RT x gamers can now enjoy
ray tracing at over 60 FPS garlis of
which GPU that you're using now they
have a fun video here with Gino choy
which is a dev Technic engineer from
Nvidia and yessing
which is a rendering engineer from a
more dice yes and then you Ladon coded
out gula duck from from from dice and
they talk about the various
optimizations that they've made with
with drivers and the game itself - to
bring higher performance to bring
improve performance for people who are
using ray tracing who have this feature
enabled so it's actually kind of
interesting they're saying that RT X xx
atti users will see a 60 FPS performance
a little they'll be able to yield about
60 FPS or higher at 2560 by 1440 with DX
DX r ray tracing reflections set to
ultra which is actually pretty sweet
before I feel like they were probably
you know hovering around 30 or 40 FPS so
that's actually a massive uplift r-tx
2080 users will be able to get 60 FPS
and over with a 1440p resolution using
medium
DXR retraced reflections so I'm sure
that's that's that's not too far off and
then our TX 2070 users will be able to
see 60fps albeit at 1920 by 1080 so you
have to dump down your resolution a
little bit and that'll be with medium DX
our ray traced reflections so at any
rate you can see 60 FPS at you know with
with medium or higher ray tracing so
that's actually not too bad the video
features that these guys are talking
about
oh and that was not plugged in to
anything okay
how long is it and could it reach over
there okay yeah mine's fine I I have a
blade Pro so I have at least five
minutes of battery power I should
actually be fine for the rest of the the
rest of the screen I'm gonna turn the
membranous down a little bit so we can
we can just like plug in every 10
minutes I will just keep siphoning power
do people are people still saying
unlisted because my video is still
almost oh your videos unlisted not
anymore
well there's your servers alright it is
now nice unlisted yes I'm a dumbass who
sometimes enlists my videos thank you
very much I mean this was such a problem
in YouTube chat that it carry over to
twitch chat it's fun it's nice it's nice
to see how one platform can help the
other get our attention and I feel like
you know Jesus Christ dude you're drunk
Jesus Christ go home you're drunk well
you know what soon enough I will be
streaming from the self even selves
pissed off about effing time mad as well
so I'm as mad as you are you just found
out about this the same time I did
that's why I'm so mad and yet the rage
yes so quickly and yet so how I'm able
to compose myself
oh don't know I'm just I'm yeah I mean I
guess okay sure all right
sorry about that guys you know it's
awesome hardware
you expect absolute belligerence to take
over any sort of reasonable
functionality of the stream at any
moment so thank you very much for for
understanding but hey you know what some
some pretty cool uplift here that we're
seeing with the the dice update the beat
of the battlefield 5 update and some
geforce drivers they've managed to
increase performance in this way without
sacrificing quality by a number of ways
shader optimization
they're also implementing variable rate
racing so they're only like you know
creating only placing rays where they
matter so maybe when you're looking at a
specific scene or when you're looking at
a specific part of a scene those those
rays will be rendered a lot more than
the surrounding rays it kind of reminds
me of what's the actual term for for VR
when they're only rendering the actual
part that you're looking at ghostbusters
it's not ghostbusters something similar
to that though so I would never ever
people say rate racing I think of Ray
from ghostbusters
this is varied I'm sure that everyone
thinks that - you're probably not the
only one you go you gone yep no totally
totally the same ghostbusters I got you
so you know there they found some
optimizations they've removed a bug
apparently that was tanking performance
during environment destruction so
anytime a building would blow up a
primary tank that was due to a bug
apparently that they have since removed
foliage and grass has been optimized and
that sort of thing so yay and I think
this goes to show that ray tracing is
still so early on it's still very much
in its infancy there's gonna be a lot of
optimizations that will need to happen
in in the near future that will
hopefully uplift the performance
continually and I don't think this is
the last time we're going to see ray
tracing get some serious gains in the
performance field yeah it's a it's
really early developers don't even know
what to do with this technology and I
said so I feel like the longer that it
becomes the longer that it's here the
more the better that games will be
optimized for it and eventually we can
see performance actually get to more
mainstream friendly levels because right
now you
if you have if you have an RT X 2070 for
example you're not really gonna be able
to take advantage of ray tracing unless
they really optimized the hell out of it
which it looks like they're beginning to
so it's gnarly technology I think it's
also a technology that Nvidia was very
quick to get out the door to be the
first ones there and to say hey we have
this cool thing that the competition
doesn't and there are certain pros and
cons to that the pro is that you are the
first on the scene the the con is that
you may not have optimized it fully to
the best of its capacity or best of its
ability at that moment so I feel like
obviously the market is very impatient
when you're advertising when your whole
product stack is banking on a single
feature like ray tracing as very much
was demonstrated by the Nvidia press
conference people expect it to work just
like like it's been here for years like
it's been here for a decade and that
it's fully optimized and it's not that's
the fact that it's not and that's not
the consumers fault for thinking that
way in fact it's it's really Nvidia who
should who should be able to bring a
full product to market that operates
exactly as intended the way that they've
advertised it to and I think I think
it's just going to take some time so
what do you say to those who would say
that they're passing the game and
getting a 50% in performance
improvements that that would clearly
indicate that they were premature in
their promotion and publication of ray
tracing in general because obviously it
was ready if they're able to get this
much performance improvement just a few
weeks after or like a week or two after
the launch of the Windows Update that
even enabled you to turn on ray tracing
in general in the game then I mean from
from my perspective I might say well I
think they could have gotten a much more
positive response from the community
with this if they hadn't changed from
GTX to RTX because of ray tracing if
they hadn't said ray tracing ray tracing
ray tracing it just works and all the
stuffs that Jensen said it
it's sort of eased off on that a little
bit and said like here's our next
generation graphics processor here's the
performance improvements we're expecting
and the more fundamental areas of
framerate and improvements that people
would expect and by the way it's also
got this ray-tracing feature it's not
ready for the mainstream yet but it's
there for developers to work with and
make games and maybe as time progresses
we'll see a lot of cool games that
implement this for our realistic
experiment right experience yeah Heather
if they had done that rather than B ray
tracing our TX ray tracing ray tracing
are you proposing that Nvidia be honest
and time Jay tell it how it is I'm just
saying what a preposterous pitch oh we
talked a little bit about on my half of
the show but I I don't I don't know if
anyone from Nvidia watches this show
maybe from time to time but like I
totally agree musician ined and
messaging is is very important for stuff
like this and I am I am I am definitely
one who would say that I think ray
tracing is good I think ray tracing is
definitely something that when you look
at the future of video games will be
implemented more widely and lead to more
immersive experience and more realistic
rendering of you know virtual 3d
environments absolutely but obviously
right now and I just tested this the
other day if you're playing with a $1200
r-tx 2080 TI and getting 70 or 80 frames
per second in battlefield 5 at 4k and
then you turn on ray tracing and
suddenly your framerate drops to 20 to
25 frames per second and it's choppy
mess that you can't even legitimately
play you're like well this feature that
I was sold on that was pitched so much
I'm not really feeling right now so you
you get disappointed so I think the way
that's set up and the way it's sold the
people will you know will affect their
response to it when they actually try it
and I think that that was 10
some what then Nvidia wouldn't be
dealing with this whole like the r-tx on
our TX off me meme and everything ring
and Rob performance is good enough for
most gamers let's let's be honest you
don't need fancy new technologies for
most gamers most gamers just want higher
FPS they want smoother frame rates they
want to rock up 165 Hertz monitor you
know at 1440p Nvidia could have just
come out with that right out the gate
and like you said just said you know we
have this ray-tracing thing it's kind of
cool it's not fully developed yet and
whatever but it's coming and these cars
are gonna be able to support it yeah
because at the end of the day isn't
performance the only thing that Nvidia
really needs to prove themselves over
AMD like AMD doesn't even compete in the
high-end space right now why did Nvidia
have to harp so hardly on rate racing
when the performance isn't even there
from the competition what was the point
you know that they're getting ahead of
themselves a little bit maybe get a
little cocky maybe be trying to up the
prices of their cars a little bit more
in trying to find you know what we can't
sell these cards for you know these
cards are faster but we can't sell them
for the insane prices we want unless we
add something more than just performance
let's add great racing to the mix and
say that it's way more equipped and wait
way more ready than it really is so you
know they all greedy there but I
completely agree with you Paul it is it
is quite a situation that people are you
know it's unfolding in its own way but
the good thing is how that if you bought
an RT x card not all is lost
optimizations are coming they're here
and they're gonna continue this is just
sort of tip of the iceberg there's gonna
be further improvements and further
optimizations for ray tracing and things
like that DX are that you will start to
feel a bit more of your money's worth
I think as time goes on and that was
also gonna say just that the market has
spoken to some degree when it comes to
Nvidia and I would say this is a
combination of things both the reaction
and response to the RT X launch but also
they're sort of miscalculation with
speculating with the future of the GPU
mining market and the reason they're
having to take a lot of losses right now
for that yeah and and this was this was
last month in the middle of November
that Nvidia's stock took a big old a big
old dick it's recovered somewhat since
then but it still definitely nowhere
what it was so you know I have to
imagine that internally that they are
reflecting on their decisions of last
year and maybe figuring out what they
could I don't know do different or
whatever but yeah it's a hard time of
the year to drop your stock that that
dramatically tail right right into the
holidays but let's move on we have a lot
more to talk about here we have an
article from just buy it Tom's Hardware
talking about a Athlon 200 GE
overclocked 23.9 bina hertz buy them
with the new msi bios hey this is insane
this is a youtuber tech epiphany
initially posted a video on thursday
showing that he had overclocked an
Athlon 200 g 55 dollar this is a 55
dollar locked multiplier GPU it's a
dual-core CPU it has a lock multiplier
but yet this youtuber uploaded video
saying he overclocked it to 3.8 how how
did how did he manage to do that well it
was it was an msi bios that had
apparently upgraded or apparently
supports the 1.0.0 point 6 firmware that
inadvertently unlocked the chips
multiplier so this is not an official
support of overclocking from msi msi has
since released a statement saying we do
not officially support overclocking on
the Athlon 200 GE it just so happens
that this BIOS update unlocked the
multiplier and now enthusiasts can go in
and tweak it so that's that good
actually kind of cool you get some free
performance there it's it remains to be
seen whether or not this this freedom
this new freedom will will continue to
exist or if a future BIOS update will
sort of can it or whatever but you could
always revert back to that BIOS update
and overclock the hell out of it if you
wanted to so it's kind of interesting
Tom's Hardware found that when
overclocked the 200 GE performance
improves its standing amongst other
Intel competitors more so in single
threaded performance than multi-threaded
because it is you know only limited to
two cores and four threads so far for
thread processor yeah two core dual core
four threads so you know more so on the
single threaded gains less on the
multi-threaded performance but it still
is
is able to sort of compete with some
CPUs on the Intel side that it otherwise
would get beaten out by so that's kind
of cool
um it specifically had some high marks
in photo editing video conferencing and
video editing within the PC mark 10
benchmark so that was actually kind of
cool it beat out some intel competitors
there it still trails behind elsewhere
and other and other in other tests and
stuff there were no gaming tests
interestingly enough in this Tom's
Hardware article I would imagine that
you might get a few FPS gain from from
from such an overclock how could you not
however I don't think it would be enough
to beat out some of the some of the more
expensive some of the more pricier more
pricey Intel CPUs just as Intel Intel
Architecture at the moment is just a bit
faster for gaming more higher
instructions per clock and that sort of
thing but it's interesting that this is
the we don't really talk about we
haven't really talked much about the
Athlon 200 G it is currently the only
non overclockable Zen based model from
AMD so it's actually you know every
other every other SKU that you know that
that's then based is overclockable
except for this one I guess until now if
you have that BIOS update so that's kind
of interesting it doesn't even have it's
very it's a very basic chip as well it
doesn't even have support for things
like precision boost so instead of like
you know gathering you know what what
kind of temperatures and and power
limitations your CPU is that it'll just
run it at a static 3.2 gigahertz
frequency so it doesn't even have
precision boost and things like that the
fact that you can overclock this thing
now to 3.9 gigahertz potentially even
further if you had like some exotic
liquid cooling solution or whatever is
actually kind of cool and could maybe
give you a bit more value to to a rather
cheap CPU the III when I spotted this in
the past few days I was initially kind
of like oh that's really cool if there's
a 55 dollar processor that you know you
can do do a few tweaks to this reminds
me a little bit of like some of the
early skylake stuff and some of the
be clock unlocked bios's that you could
do with that but there's some definite
caveats and limitations to this
particular thing I mean if you're in a
serious budget and you're really limited
and like fifty five dollars for CPU
makes a lot of sense to you then you can
consider it but you have to bear in mind
you cannot overclock the memory with
this so you're stuck with 2666 memory
and we all know or probably know that
faster memory is Verizon is very helpful
yeah for the overall performance and
then you're you're basically stuck with
these msi BIOS releases they did a BIOS
release for pretty much their entire
motherboard line-up I believe for for
both 300 series and 400 series
motherboards that enables this however
it means that if you want this you're
gonna have to use that BIOS and so that
means that any future updates any future
at G's updates that and AMD launches
you're not gonna be able to get there if
you do that then you'll you know you'll
lose the or go the overclocking ability
that you had so right it's kind of cool
but it's pretty Miche if the memory
thing wasn't an issue that or if like
msi was saying yeah we're just british
allah we're just gonna leave it this way
now then that would be a little bit more
yeah interesting to me but yeah i mean
friend it for someone who's who's
looking to dig in there and do some
tweaks and only wants to spend 55 bucks
on a processor then there you go it's
gonna breathe new life into your chip
yeah next up we've got an article from
overclocked 3d about Silverstone's
smallest the world's smallest kilowatt
class PS use the strider Platinum pts
nice this is actually pretty impressive
a thousand watt and 1200 watt units are
now available in a hundred and forty
millimeter long ATX form factor uh-huh
do you realize like I first I thought
these were sfx power supplies they are
not they are ATX power supplies but a
mere 140 millimeters long that's a very
small power supply commonly found with
like 650 watt - you know 750 watt units
but with kilowatt level performance guys
a thousand watt and
1200 watt model damnit Silverstone is
just insane to me I'm angry why did you
wire the blue poor girl the power PCI
Express graphics power plug still all
blue fine we have we have we have power
supplies shrouds with PSU shrouds we
have basements it's 2018 Paul
so I usually find in most case I used
the Silverstone Strider platinum series
power supply on my wife's Mini ITX
system yeah and I had to physically go
in here and like modify the spray seems
it's like color it to try to like be it
so that blue doesn't stand out it was
quite annoying there's there it's not
like they're saving money by doing this
there's plenty of blue peg connectors
like that they could swap in there just
damnit Silverstone just frustrating that
doesn't need to be like that just make
it all black its power supply I agree I
would have zero caveats about this
entire thing but like damn it if you if
you're building and like specifically in
a situation rather like I needed a
really short power supply there's
probably a higher chance that you're
building something where your space
limited and maybe you're doing water
cooling or something like that sure and
you're concerned about aesthetics and
you don't want some random-ass blue shit
in there yeah yep messing up your entire
thing so that's true I love this power
supply that's true I'm amazed that
they're able to fit 1200 watts into this
thing but ah okay I like how they've
managed just like this industry first
achievement and you're like fuck that
blue though yeah I just credit
everything there's a ton people building
like a smaller system with a really cool
water cooling loop who's like oh I'm
doing black white and blue we're like
like blue is part of my theme that'll
match but I mean for anyone else like
that it's not even a blue that really
matches anything either it's not of
course Sarah blue it's not if it was
like a corsair blue because you know of
course here has like like their
vengeance line sometimes love that blue
lighter blue it's kind of like a baby
blue it doesn't even match it with
anything it really it really doesn't but
you know what I would hope that if you
have a thousand watt PSU that you're
probably plugging in a bunch of stuff
you're connecting a bunch of
peripherals and things like that and
that hopefully the other cables around
those ports would sort of mask would
sort of mask those hideous ports a
little bit but if what I said a little
fan is here and the fan is facing down
then this would be the most obvious
vector on near power so that would be
the first thing just saying but also if
you have a PSU shroud that's PS Rouge
but all right continues that everything
there is to write PC Gamer has has been
talking about the steam bug that
recently cut some indie dev developers
revenue in half just kind of a big deal
if you're if this is how you make a
living this is your life you this is
your job you make a living selling
videogames that you develop this is a
huge deal people many developers have
been claiming that in October there was
a bug that allegedly crawled into steams
discovery feature causing it to
recommend only large popular games
instead of more relevant games that's it
that's an issue indie developers took to
Twitter actually posting graphs like the
one ones that Paul showing up here
posting graphs featuring the units sold
which showed a dramatic drop right after
the October bug was introduced developer
Jake Burkett said that full price sales
before and after the October bug have
nearly halved or they have in fact have
revenue has dipped further since their
most expensive game has dropped to 36%
of previous unit sales a huge huge game
kingdoms and castles huge indie game
their designer Peter egg Scott said the
daily sales dipped by 30 to 40 percent
when the bug appeared and their sales
still have not recovered so whether or
not this is a bug things have seriously
been a detriment to to steam to indie
Steam sale indie games view sale
developers lately and there has not been
a solution in fact a lot of these
developers have reached out to steam
personally and have received zero
response it seems like steam is staying
completely silent on the issue
and they are not issuing any sort of
official statements they're not replying
to any developer's emails there seems to
be zero support whatsoever zero voice
coming from steam so is there also seems
to be a significant amount of indie
developers or lesser-known developers
who are concerned about discoverability
on Steam
absolutely yeah who have not yet been
established um how do you break break
into like such a saturated market when
there's a bug that's preventing you from
even being advertised to the to the
masses or to anyone to any steam user in
fact when it's really just the top 1% of
games game developers who have their
games you know front and center it's
it's really kind of a it's kind of
broken right now the developer threat on
Steam right now is 55 pages long there's
this huge ongoing discussion about it
the issue has been going on for two
months developers still don't even know
if it is in fact a bug maybe the
after-effects of a bug or just a feature
that's been designed to sort of shine a
spotlight on different kinds of games so
at the very least what they can all
agree on is is that valve is not
discussing the algorithm they're being
very tight-lipped about the whole thing
which reminds me a lot of YouTube you
know I felt like there was a moment
there after the ad pocalypse where I
wasn't getting like our channel wasn't
bringing in the same amount of ad
revenue that it had been I mean and you
noticed you know when you've been doing
it for years and you see sort of a trend
like okay we're you know every month we
make at least this much every month
we're making at least this much and then
something happens and everyone's talking
about it hey there's this weird thing
and then you noticed your ad revenue
just tanked by 30 40 50 percent you
you're like what the hell I haven't been
in my formulas the same I haven't
changed anything I haven't tried to
reinvent the wheel but yet my revenue is
down a significant amount and it impacts
your daily life and then you know I've
tried reaching out to YouTube in the
past hey what's going on here is there
anything that I'm doing wrong
they could be doing better and to not
receive a response is just as it's the
most sort of frustrating thing ever you
feel so helpless and you know what can
you do and these are people's
livelihoods we're talking about you know
Paul and I make a living doing YouTube
videos these developers make a living
selling video games on the biggest
digital platform for games right now
which is steam and if there's a bug
that's preventing them from getting
their game seen by the masses that is
going to impact their daily lives to a
huge degree so it's quite unfortunate
but let's move on
hopefully they figure that out this is
another article from PC gamer about Epic
Games the fortnight developer massive
massive massive I mean Epic Games was
already pretty huge and now they're just
now they're like well with fur tonight
oh my god with fortnight it's just on a
whole nother level and that I think
maybe if they've just gotten maybe it's
gotten to their heads a little bit
they're trying to take on steam now with
their epic game store they're planning
an epic game store how are they gonna
plan to beat steam how in the hell do
you ever compete with steam they figured
it out seemingly seduce the devs seduce
the devs and also seduce the players how
do you seduce the players by giving them
free games give them free stuff so in
all of 2019 there will be a new game
every two weeks that all players receive
for free it's all funded by epic and
that's that's two games a month that's
24 games that you will get for free for
the year of 2019 that's pretty
compelling again depending on the games
that you're that you're getting right if
there's some cheapo Humble Bundle five
dollar indie games that rules shit I
wasn't even interest in that game where
I had since like two bucks whatever then
that's something else but if they're
triple-a games if they're good games
they're highly reviewed games that
people are interested in they're all the
hype then hey that could be a really
compelling offer that could bring a lot
of people over to at least check it out
to at least give this new platform a
chance at the very least so it's kind of
compelling there it's kind of
interesting for for the developers they
they also have some incentive to
check out epic game store including a
much higher split much higher revenue
split of 88% to 12 percent so developers
will keep 88 and epic will keep 12
percent do you know what the current
split is for steam no what's that what's
the current split 7030 so you only keep
70% as a developer right now on Steam
that's 18% more yes yes it is oh sorry
my brain stops 6278
absolutely and you know that's that's a
pretty significant amount for a lot of
people every every every dollar counts
you know we're just trying to make a
buck these days and you know that's that
I think that's that's a fair fair scene
it seems very fair to me or split a fair
split and I think that by appealing to
the to the players as well as the
developers that is the only way that
they're gonna be able to take on steam
in any small you know in any small to
any small degree them and they need to
make half-life 3 I think once they make
half-life 3 yes epic epics half-life 3
half-life 3 an epic that's really that's
life 3 confirmed I think even wouldn't
allow that or that he wouldn't mind cuz
he's completely given up on it sniff
sniff so there's also going to be a
support a creator program which which
says these are the most interesting
thing to me here this their support a
creator program aims to bring developers
and marketers together it's designed to
reward influencers like twitch streamers
cosplayers youtubers for making things
that are related to developers games so
if you're a twitch streamer that you
know I don't know or a cosplayer that
made a fallout helmet or something like
that then there would be a better way to
connect you with that game developer so
that you could get paid out for
potentially by the game developer and
that you as a creator would also be
bringing traffic you know your audience
your audience is traffic to the game
itself so that it's kind of this mutual
thing going on this sort of ecosystem of
game developer me
creator meets viewer or consumer you
know it sounds interesting you know what
I'd like to see which I feel like
there's sort of a window for it here
although I don't and there's there's
there's a middle steps that I think is
still in the ether but like if you take
somebody like who like like who makes
YouTube videos or a twitch streamer or
like even somebody who like does cosplay
or something like that and and and post
their stuff online like they can get a
following and they can get an audience
and they can get people who will invest
in them and who will donate or or
whatever to help support them because
they like what they do I don't see that
with game developers right and yet game
developers often develop products and as
in video games that people use
extensively right that I feel like
people could easily devote that same
level of yeah patronage to so it'd be
cool to see something like this yep
taken to the extent where somebody could
go and like oh I want to I want to
support my favorite game developer right
rather than like my favorite absolute
streamer youtuber or something like that
why not why should they be excluded from
the from the pop especially for anything
else are any developers I feel yeah
totally so hopefully it like if you know
if and that's a great point is that if
epic game store can can sort of
integrate sort of like let's say a
developer based patreon inside of their
platform that's something truly unique
to that platform that steam just doesn't
have it all that I feel like a lot of
developers up-and-coming developers or
even more established ones might be
attracted to that platform you know
tenfold because of a sort of an
opportunity to capitalize on their work
so that's that's actually really
interesting but we'll have to keep a
closer eye on this there's some you know
some other you know some other details
here but whatever they're not as
important let's move on to the games
report okay and talk about weight before
that oh you got a sponsor sponsor
sponsor spot yeah this sponsor spot is
brought to you once again by Toshiba
closed Shabbat don't ya give up all
right we're gonna flag for that at some
point but hey you know this is their OC
OC z RC 100
with a BICS flash which again is the SSD
that was so compelling and the nvme and
but to drive that I was so infatuated by
that I had to take it out of the box and
put it into my own personal system which
is why we have nothing here but a an
empty clamshell case on the third day
that's not look the end got to drive had
risen look here's the product page for
the RC 100 yes see how tiny it is yeah I
actually kind of want to find a small
like a mini MDOT to enclosure for it
that supports that just just the maximum
of that size I did have a super super
tiny external MDOT two external drives
yeah that'd be nice yeah just usb3 it
but yeah 22:42
is the form factor look at this we're
giving more specs on the RC 100 than we
ever had before read and write speeds
sixteen hundred megabytes per second
reads an eleven hundred megabytes per
second race it's well over thanks to the
nvme interface available in capacities
up to four hundred and eighty gigs with
a three-year warranty this is one of
many products that toshiba has based on
v.i.c s NAND flash memory but TR 200 is
also a really great option if you're
looking for a budget level MD I'm sorry
a two and a half inch drive maybe that's
a great save three Rev 6rf 3.0 SATA
rev3games excuse like a bit percentage
mmm alcohol is really doing a number on
man mmm
those are all also great drives what was
the external drive model I forget that
one that was the I know what that is it
is the uh they have an external drive if
you're looking for a external USB 3.0 SS
XS 700 of course XO 700 which we've both
committed to memory at this point right
here
um also delivers great speeds great
transfer speeds over USB 3 and I've seen
a Type C interface as well yep you can
find links to all that stuff in my
description I just copy pasted the links
from Paul so you actually probably will
get a kickback affair that's fine
because like when we first started this
ad campaign I copied and pasted yours so
it's a trade off pure communism
beautiful all right thank you see before
sponsoring awesome hardware thanks to
Shiva
Toshiba moving on to the games
port this article is from hot hardware
things hot hardware about Bethesda oh my
gosh Bethesda Bethesda Bethesda do you
know you know what's going on with
Bethesda lately right know what's we
talked about this I think on a previous
episode not too long ago so they had
they had fallout 76 right there launch
was the launch for fallout 76 was
abysmal it was absolutely it was
terrible it was one of the worst
launches in videogame history especially
for a game with soumitab lished history
absolutely with many fans from a
reputable developer yeah like it was
that's very surprising I was very
surprised with the like I don't have any
dirt I never played football at 76 but I
read lots of feedback from lots of
people oh yeah at it and it was the same
surprising and you know Bethesda games
have always been sort of buggy here and
there people just have learned to accept
it but pathetic but but fallout 76 was
buggy like no other I mean it was
virtually unplayable for some people in
certain parts of the game there was just
random crashes you know characters would
freeze just random bugs everywhere it
just made the game so unenjoyable and it
was such a disaster of a launch and they
were there stilling they were releasing
massive patches almost on a daily basis
to rectify these issues which were only
rectifying some of them the game was
still so broken that so many people
requested refunds and Bethesda only only
honored a very small portion of refunds
and so people blew they're late like
people were pissed off like I don't like
this game it doesn't even work it it's
it's broken
I want a refund and Bethesda would not
honor refunds for so many people so much
to the point where there's actually a
law firm who's considering filing a
class act lawsuit a class-action lawsuit
for what are they calling it deceptive
trade practices that's how broken this
game is and then and then there was a a
$200 fallout 76 armored edition that
people bought they bought
this armored edition for Fallout 76 for
$200 never spent $200 on anything video
game related unless it's like a
dedicated concert or something like that
the power the power armor Edition
included the base game itself with a try
Centennial steelbook it had a glow in
the dark world terrain map 24
collectable Fallout figurines a bonus
bonus in-game items a full-scale
wearable t51 power armor helmet which is
probably the the image that you're
seeing right there
Oh unless unless it's not being shown
and then a westtech canvas carrying bag
now this westtech canvas carrying bag
that's that was included in the armor
the power armor edition for fall of 76
looked just as advertised it looked
right there like that's a nice looking
bag never mind the fortnight loading
page and there are people out there who
like collecting swag from their favorite
video games or their favorite anime or
their favorite pop culture whatever and
they're just like closing this shit also
says canvas right there canvas this is
canvas that's so that's specified and so
people were expecting a bag that looked
exactly like that because that's the one
that they were advertising rightfully so
they should be expecting that but cut
but customers rightfully so also lost
their minds when instead they received
not canvas bags but these nylon carrying
bags that look more like trash bags than
anything else they they looked so
utterly different and just pathetic
quite frankly I saw some pictures of it
I'm like no absolutely no I don't know
there's no picture of that in the
article from what I could tell but these
are totally not the same sexy canvas
bags that were advertised within the
fallout 76 power armor Edition package
so people lost their effing minds and
Bethesda said that they had to resort to
these nylon shitty carrying bags due to
unavailability of materials which is not
a great excuse to say the least
and so what did Bethesda do to make
things right instead of giving them the
bags they want any fun or easy or
instead even this one in sash
I would hatch money doubt actor hand of
the customers who they misled in order
to maybe recoup maybe Bethesda I didn't
possess the needs you Paul because that
was the furthest thing that they did in
fact what they did was they gave every
affected customer of these power armor
Edition packages five hundred atoms five
hundred atoms that's in game credit for
fall at seventy six halogen atoms as is
like as in like an atom of hydrogen or
helium or something like more or less
but five hundred atoms in Fallout
seventy six equates to five real dollars
my very old world money so for paying a
two hundred dollar fee for this package
where you were gonna get this awesome
canvas bag they gave you you know what
we're sorry here's five bucks of in-game
credit people customers were not happy
to say the least
so now Bethesda has finally owned up to
it and they're now sending out
replacement canvas bags to power armor
Edition owners now customers have to
provide proof of purchase of course they
have to submit a ticket to the support
site to the developer support site by
January 1st of 2019 blahdy blahdy blah
to receive their bag replacements will
be sent out as soon as the bags are
ready that could be one month from now
that could be ten months from now we
don't know but I feel like even though
it was the right move eventually for
Bethesda to make it's also a little bit
too late and the damage has already been
done between the failure of a launch to
the refusal of refunds and to this whole
bag debacle Bethesda has lost the trust
of thousands hundreds of thousands of
people I think with this single launch
alone and it's it's quite unfortunate
so so to me like whether I think if you
want to boil it down to the fundamental
issue that people are pissed off about
it's not about like a nylon bag versus a
canvas bag like that's a that that's
that's a that's a detail that's a
nuanced day it's about Bethesda as a
company with one of their premier
products being the Fallout series
and the premiere edition of that product
being the $200 version of it that people
are who with with the disposable income
and the passion for that game were able
to say like yes I'm gonna drop this much
money on it are getting something that
essentially is like a like a monetized
they're basically like trying to make as
much money as possible out of this sure
they're like making it they're giving
you the cheapest possible products for
the most possible price right because of
your enthusiasm for this game right
they're taking advantage of its it's a
cheap and terrible way of treating
customers so good that they replacing
them but like I would they should just
send out replacement canvasbacks to
anyone who bought him without having to
go through any yeah you know yep their
hoops to get them replaced or something
like that but exactly obviously that
would cost more money and you know
they're only doing any of this because
the backlash has been so severe yeah you
know they're not doing it out of the
kindness of their hearts or because they
felt it was the right thing to do
they're doing it to save face because
they're trying to put out fires right
now they're in full mode they're in full
damage control mode and they're just
trying to save whatever bit of
reputation I have left with with their
consumer base it's it's really quite sad
it's also frustrating because Bethesda
in the past at least in my memory has
not pulled this type of shit before Yeah
right
so it makes me wonder is that you know
Sherman there are certain developers who
you kind of have some level of trust in
like like the ones that you expect it's
not a direct relation like Rockstar for
example yeah I have some level of trust
in Rockstar sure I think they make good
products and good games you can look at
Red Dead Redemption you can look at
Grand Theft Auto 5 does Rockstar
monetize their games and try to make
money off of them yes does GTA 5 have a
you know purchasable system of in-game
purchases that you can make for real
money that they make lots of profit on
yes but did they make some sort of
reasonable assessment of that to make
sure that you're you're buying mostly
cosmetic items and that there's some
sort of some level of balance between
the grind to get into that that cosmetic
thing versus just pay for it outright
right you know you're trying to find
that balance yep and and and it's it's a
tricky it's not an easy thing to do as a
game developer but Bethesda I think has
lost a lot of trust um with this with
what's happened in the past month or so
to that so I think they know how big
they are they realize the weight that
they carry and they're taking advantage
of it to a degree yeah and they're
they're doing the lying greedy on enough
people who have played Fallout games in
the past feel like I love fallout I've
always had fun with it I'm gonna buy
this next one too and yeah that's what
happens when you try to exploit people
for as much money as possible as they
start realizing hey I'm being exploited
yeah right for my money and I'm not
getting something valuable in return
Bryton that's theoretically how and
capitalism would have been fine if they
just gave you gave people the bag that
they paid for that they advertised there
would be no stink people would see the
picture like this is exactly the bag
that I paid for be no issue but for you
to try to slide one under the gamers to
slide them under your own customer base
just to turn a profit maybe even more
than you already were it is just
dishonest and just shows how good you
guys have gotten in that in that
instance so hopefully they can turn it
around something at some point but let's
move on we have another article here
from Windows Central about GameStop
being a little bit in trouble here they
reported a seven sorry a 488 million
dollar lost last quarter for q3 of 2018
holy moly
now physical game sales physical game
sales were pretty strong in 2013 but
since then they've been slowly taken
over by digital downloads of course
which have taken up a massive slice of
the pie I was gonna say 2013 was five
years ago it was five years ago and you
know it's a game stock is slowly dying
it seems this is a report by game rant
that's who reported this crazy loss of
almost 500 million almost half a billion
dollars of loss in just the last quarter
alone despite having a solid growth from
from hardware sales and accessories
there's also been a thirteen point four
percent decline in pre-owned game sales
so pre-owned games haven't been doing so
hot either I can't even remember the
last time I went out to go buy a
pre-owned game to get a great deal on
game it's also become harder and harder
to actually resell a pre-owned game when
little digital you know if you're if
you're doing with digital copies that
are tied to your steam accounts or or
just DRM techniques in general that have
tried to prevent you from right taking a
physical copy and passing it on to
somebody else who buys it from you yeah
and and they're also I think with
digital downloads when you cut out that
the overhead cost of physical shipping
physically shipping a product you're
able to give bigger discounts on digital
sales and digital purchases and I feel
like that has also sort of competed with
the used games market where it's like
hey I can buy this game brand-new on
Steam for 30% off or I could buy like a
used physical game at gamestop for the
same price and you know obviously you're
gonna go with the digital one it's more
convenient it's it's brand new
technically you have to worry about like
physical imperfections about the game
not working and stuff in your console
whatever in your PC so there's there it
feels like Game Stop is slowly going the
way of blockbuster or those like you
know physical video outlets I have video
rentals it seems like that's that's the
that's the the way that it's going but
who's to say it'll be interesting to see
if Game Stop eventually gets sold off to
a bigger parent company I'm thinking
acquired or something like that absorbed
into a bigger company but at the very
least right now it doesn't seem good for
Farrokh gamestop basically I used to go
to Game Stop when I was like in high
school and stuff for you know when I was
like gaming on GameCube and PlayStation
2 and stuff they were great but now that
the landscape of gaming has changed so
much you know I bought an Xbox one and
about an Xbox 1x recently I
downloaded all of Red Dead Redemption to
in its entirety within you know like an
hour or something like that didn't have
to go fight for you know the last copy
at some store and I was just like this
is this is the future this is where
we're headed this is where we're at and
yeah it just seems like I don't know
game stops gonna seriously have to
implement some sort of game streaming
service or I don't know what they're
gonna have to do to stay competitive I'd
I'd like to see something in between
because I don't want to see all the
retail locations like Game Stop go away
because I think there is some social
aspect to a store like Game Stop sure
people going in there and talking to the
people who work there write about games
they like and getting advice or like hey
try this out or whatever is in it place
yeah I think that's beneficial so I'd
hate to see it go away entirely yeah
but definitely they need to modify their
business model if they're gonna stay
competitive definitely sure yeah all
right so next up our life circle here's
from polygon about Rockstar actually we
were speaking about roxtor just earlier
and this talks about their Red Dead
online so Red Dead Redemption online
just launched its beta very recently and
he has part because he's going crazy the
most part it was okay but the economy
was a big talking point a lot of people
took to Reddit and Twitter and social
media and they were really upset about
how the economy was looking so far
mainly because that the the payouts of
in-game currency for various activities
are we're too low compared to the
extreme cost of certain things like
weapons or even like essential needs
like you know your your camp your your
camp upkeep or your food maintenance
items and things like that but weapons
and upgrades were so expensive have you
played online I have not played online
yet I haven't had a chance you have
played single-player there I have played
single-player and my god it's it's great
actually
wifey sauce has really been enjoying it
too we've been switching off like I'll
play a mission and then she'll watch me
and then and then she'll play a mission
and then I'll watch her because the
cinematics in between are such a great
storytelling element that sort of ties
all the gameplay together
that it really feels like you're just a
part of this immersive story this
narrative and it's movie that she really
enjoys that that storytelling aspect I'm
looking forward to playing it like I'm
planning to at some point but I haven't
yet but all of everything I've heard
about like playing through the game has
been incredibly positive absolutely you
know and hopefully you know banking on
that PC port at some point you'd have to
think with the amount of cash that
rockstars brought in and take twos
brought in from from making GTA 5 go
online or I'm sorry go via PC that they
would also bring that same support for
Red Dead Redemption to and that they
would see just tremendous tremendous
sales and stuff like that from from it
from expanding their platforms but it
remains to be seen
so hopefully the economy will be more
balanced within with a future update
that Rockstar has already planned that's
the great thing about Rockstar also is
that they listen to user feedback very
intently they take a lot of feedback to
heart and they've already issued a
statement saying that they're gonna be
releasing a pair of updates that are
gonna be rolling out soon that that will
certainly a balance that'll sort of
rebalance the economy so that you're not
gonna feel like you're just doing all
these missions and activities for
pennies you'll actually be getting paid
a generous amount that you can that
you'll feel you know like you've
achieved something you'll be able to buy
weapons with it upgrades and you'll be
able to have a bit more spending power
than you originally did in the online
beta so that's really cool and that is
the end of my half of the show whenever
there's discussion of video games and in
game economies I always default back to
Diablo 2 which I played along long ago
right and how the economy became based
around the stone of Jordan which was a
ring a unique ring you can get in the
game yeah be it but it took a lot of
work to build up to the point where you
could get a stone of Jordan and then you
could you know trade that for other
stuff
anyway yep ensued the tsuj that's it the
Saudis go so damn that and yet spam then
trade chat alright so that's all for
this half of the show that is it thank
you guys so much for watching but don't
go anywhere so fun we're gonna do we're
gonna do a after-party in just a bit
yeah be sure to toss a like on this
video and feel free to do timestamps in
the comments whoever does is my precious
little angel it's not creepy at all
I'm gonna play for tonight in the after
party Paul's gonna play for tonight you
guys want to see what Paul looks like
playing for tonight it's gonna be gonna
be terrible sanely
