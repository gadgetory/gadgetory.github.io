channel hope you're all doing well today
I am taking a look at the dark bass 700
mid tower case from be quiet
this comes in at a hundred and eighty
USD which is fairly steep for a case
these days I'll be honest so I'm kind of
expecting a lot for this particular
price point and I'm excited to check it
out today to see if it actually is worth
the money as you can see I've already
built a full system inside of this case
and I've already formulated my own
opinions about it and I'm excited to
share those all with you today as well
for starters let's talk about the
outside of the case first and we'll work
our way to the inside as we usually do
with these types of reviews I would say
the construction is some of the best
I've seen in recent months I would say
this is the best quality case I've seen
all year which is saying a lot because
we've had some really good contenders
coming out since January but this thing
is just it feels so solid even more
solid than the H 700 i from from NZXT
which comes in at $200 it's actually a
little bit more expensive than this one
I'd say the build quality tops that just
it's more well rounded every single part
of this case is really just built like a
tank as opposed to there were some some
of the drive trays I think on the HTML
UI we're a little flimsy things like
that everything through and through is
just so solid here there's very minimal
flex actually no flex from what I could
tell just sort of messing around with
the steel frame we've got aluminium
panels on the front and top it's just a
beautiful case it also has a sort of
understated look but it looks very
elegant kind of has some nice clasp to
it but it doesn't stand out too much to
be overly distracting or obnoxious by
any means you can see we've got a
gorgeous tempered tempered glass side
panel here with four thumb screws they
even have little little indents so if
you wanted to use like a coin or a
Scrooge or a flathead screwdriver to
tighten there loosen them you could do
that on the the side panel is slightly
tinted which I prefer to being fully
tinted or really tinted because it kind
of defeats the purpose in my opinion of
having a temper glass side panel so you
can definitely see all the lighting
through it just fine and it's it's
absolutely beautiful you've got some
black strips on the top and bottom just
to hide the underlying frame of the
chassis so it makes it look nice and
clean now as far as front panel
connectors go we have a three-step fan
controller with an auto
mode as well as a USB 3.1 type-c
connector thank God that in q4 of 2017
we're actually reviewing a case today
that has a 3.1 type-c connector so kudos
to you be quiet thank you very much for
that we've also got a power button wait
what's the next thing in line here let
me take a quick look whew no mic and
headphone jacks we got mic and headphone
jacks a large square power button with
an LED behind it a hard drive activity
LED as well as an RGB button so there's
six different lights or six different
colors I should say that you can switch
between here and also breathing though
there's a static or breathing though
this is the worst shot in existence I'm
sure you guys are all terribly pissed
off at me right now so you got like
orange and red and you can make it
either static or you can make it breathe
very nice very lovely or you can
actually pipe that into a 50/50 header
on your motherboard if you wanted to
control the LEDs via a motherboard
software so that's fun we've also got
two USB 3.0 ports as well you also might
notice the two large ventilation strips
that are going down the front of the
case on either side it's actually kind
of unfortunate that if you look at the
opposite side from inside of the case at
that same mesh area that you only see
about 10 to 15% of it because the
internal frame is actually covering a
large chunk of that ventilation still it
looks like there's ample airflow getting
to that front 140 millimeter fan that is
included that is a silent wings 3 fan
you also get a second 140 at the back of
the case I would have liked to see 3
included fans for a 180 dollar case but
what can you do
small gripe there additionally we've got
up to 360 or 280 millimeter radiator
support at the front of the case and you
do have room for push-pull there as long
as you don't have a super fat radiator
you should be just fine now the top of
the case is fairly closed off you only
get a few ventilation slots at the back
there is plenty of ventilation however
at the very back of the case right next
to that panel so you do have air flow
going in through there and I would
imagine most people are going to be
reserving the top of the case for
exhausting anyway so that's not too big
of an issue for me just like the front
we do get up to 280 or 360 millimetre
radiator support I actually have an H
110 I installed currently which is the
280 millimeter AIO
fit in just fine we'll talk more about
that once we crack open the side panel
on the back you get seven expansion
slots that are in the traditional
horizontal position with two vertical
ones however you do not get any PCIe
riser card included with this case it's
something you'd have to purchase
separately but bear in mind you would be
able to mount a GPU vertically if you
wanted to do that so that's kind of cool
you get a cutout for your power supply
which installs from the backside of your
motherboard it doesn't install from the
actual rear but rather behind your
motherboard tray once the left or I
should say the right side panel is is
removed and then on the other side you
just get a normal side panel with
captive thumb screws which is also very
nice on the bottom of the case you can
see we've got some large feet you know
what that means ladies with some rubber
pads on the bottom so it doesn't slip
around there's also a full length dust
filter that is removable from the front
of the case you actually have to pop up
the the front panel in order to access
it
I should mention there's also a front
panel dust filter that's removable in
the same way like everything else in
this case the dust filters feel very
well built and they don't require you to
move the case in any way in order to
access them which i think is a huge plus
especially if you eat generally have
your PC placed against a wall or
something like that but that's pretty
much it for the exterior why don't we go
ahead and crack open the side panel and
take a look under the hood so taking a
look at the inside here we get a fairly
cavernous interior with support for up
to a ATX motherboards but I should
mention that if you are sliding in a
full size 13 inch wide EA TX board that
you are probably gonna cover up the
three large rubber grommets there on the
right of the board so bear that in mind
that being said the rubber grommets
there are very nice premium quality they
feel nice to the touch and they don't
fall out of their little holes when
you're passing cables through them like
some other cheaper cases do additionally
I think those are the only rubber
grommets in the entire case at the top
you get pretty much just a long cutout
where you can pass cables through for
like your 12 12 volt EPS and maybe some
some other fan business going on there
you get the same sort of thing at the
bottom with this long cutout that sort
of spans the entire width of your
motherboard that's large enough for
passing smaller front panel connectors
through but larger cables like your USB
3.0 20 pin are not going to fit so in
that case you're gonna have to remove
one of these modular panels that are
pretty much lining the top of your power
supply basement which I'm kind of
confused by I mean I feel like they do
make it look really clean by keeping
them there but it's kind of pointless
when you have to remove one of them to
pass through larger cables like USB 3 it
just kind of looks awkward now that only
this one part is missing a panel so I
don't know I don't know if you guys
agree with that but I think it's just
kind of odd because when you actually
remove the panel it gives you access to
larger cutouts than what that long
cutout is able to offer so I don't know
it's just an interesting sort of
configuration it looks really nice when
the panels are on but you're most likely
gonna have to take one or more of them
off anyway so I don't know if that makes
sense but interesting design move there
it does look super clean regardless you
get some nice be quiet branding on the
front of your power supply shroud which
kind of gives it a nice touch I kind of
like the fact that there's no LED
backlit area or anything like that
she's very understated which I like and
at the top here we can see our 280
millimeter radiator as part of our AIO
the great thing about this is that you
actually get a removable bracket for
your radiator so you only have to
unscrew unscrew two screws one on either
side and the whole thing pops out you
mount your radiator to it separately and
then you install it all at the same time
into your case which is a fantastic
solution this is very similar to what
we've seen on the n3 we evolved ATX from
fantex which is executed just as well in
this case I'm happy to say and it just
feels really sturdy it's a little bit a
little bit tricky like getting it in
there because you are limited by the
length of the the water cooling tubes so
it's kind of hard to sort of position it
straight down when you're putting it
back into place but it gets the job done
it and it does work pretty nicely
additionally it's just nice if you know
let's say because earlier in the build I
actually forgot to install or plug in my
12-volt EPS connector it was really nice
just being able to unscrew the two
screws to sort of pull this bracket out
a couple inches so I could get back
there plug it in and simply put it back
instead of you know having to remove all
eight of my radiator screws so that was
an awesome little feature there now it's
worth mentioning that I started this
build out with a different memory kit
than the one I've got in now I actually
had to swap that kit out because I was
two clearance issues with the radiator
so bear in mind if you have a 280
millimeter radiator that you're mounting
to the top of this case that it'd
probably be a good idea to invest in
some low profile modules like this
Corsair Vengeance LT X kit that I've
done here
moving on to these weird rectangular
things though on the right side of the
case there are five of them they're
actually just cover plates for aesthetic
purposes you can remove any of those and
swap them out for a modular drive cage
or drive tray I should say for three and
a half inch or two and 1/2 inch drives
in fact each of those trays can house
either one three and a half inch drive
or two two and a half inch drives
however be quiet only includes three of
them two of which are already populating
the drive cage underneath the power
supply tray which we'll take a look at
in a moment and then there's only one
additional one that you can put anywhere
here bear in mind of course if you
populate any of these you won't have any
room for a radiator at the front of your
case additionally if you did have a
radiator I should have mentioned this
earlier you can pop off this bottom
panel to make way for longer radiators
going down to the bottom of your chassis
as far as the drive trays themselves go
they're incredibly sturdy full metal
construction they've got rubber pads on
either side to reduce the noise and
vibration and once you actually use a
screw driver to mount your hard drive to
the actual tray it's fairly toolless
after that there's three thumb screws at
the back that are captive minds you that
you basically just slot into either any
of these five windows from behind the
motherboard tray and screw it down with
the thumb screws it's a very nice clean
easy to use solution so good on you be
quiet for that oh wait you know what
before we take a look at the backside
there's one big feature here that I
almost forgot to mention and that is
just like the dark base Pro 900 you can
actually reverse the motherboard here
internally so you can actually flip the
entire interior of the case 180 degrees
so the the motherboard and the graphics
card and all the good stuff is showing
up on the right side of your chassis as
opposed to the left side of your chest
you like it is now so very cool feature
offers a ton of flexibility if that's
your thing
now finally moving onto the back here
limit oh give me a second so taking a
look behind our motherboard tray you can
see we've got a fairly large CPU cooler
cutout which is super handy and that's
actually being covered at the moment by
an SSD tray it actually supports up to
two two and a half inch drives with a
single thumb screw on the
left side so you basically loosen that
thumb screw the whole tray comes out you
mount your drives to it and you pop it
back on you can see I've already got a
crucial MX 200 melted right here super
easy easy to use there's an additional
single two and a half inch drive mount
right here with the same sort of single
thumb screw mechanism works just the
same to the left of the drivetrain you
get a fan and RGB lighting hub and you
can connect up to six four pin PWM fans
those connectors are divided up into two
separate rails and there's a switch that
allows you to enter performance or
silent mode for either rails so you'd
have three fans going in performance and
these three fans going on silence or
whatever you know so that's pretty cool
it's definitely flexible there and of
course you can connect an RGB LED strip
so that's pretty sweet
also cleans up cable management quite a
bit so you gonna have fan wires going to
all different parts of your motherboards
and things like that no over here we're
looking at the backside of those cover
plates for our modular hard drive trays
and they're kind of ugly looking but
more importantly I wish that there was
something else that we could do with
this section of the motherboard tray
than just stare at it I feel like there
could have been some more tie-down
points here or maybe some reservoir
mounts that would have been pretty cool
if you're gonna be doing some custom
water cooling for $180 I want to see be
quiet pulling out all the stops which
means no empty space or no wasted space
in the case so to speak so that's just
one little minor minor critique there
additionally cable management elsewhere
is fantastic you get plenty plenty of
tie down points right here where your
main section is I would have liked to
see a couple DAP tie-down points on the
drive tray itself that would have been
kind of cool for like our 12 volt EPS
can plug right here our cable and maybe
a couple more to the right of the fan
hub would have been nice but not a huge
deal you do get plenty of room
underneath the power supply shroud for
stashing excess cables and things like
that
I should mention that the power supply
support is up to 285 millimeters I
believe I installed the longest power
supply I currently own which is the XP
one 1200 M extreme unit from gigabyte
and it's incredibly long and still no
problems whatsoever I was still able to
stash all the cables in there the the
power supply unit of course mounts from
this
side of the case as opposed to the very
rear like we typically see in certain
chassis summing things up here this is
honestly one of my favorite cases of
2017 it has to be it is so good and well
thought-out through and through from the
external aesthetics the cosmetics to the
actual functionality the various
features and just the level of design
and build quality here is second to none
it is I think the best case that be
quiet has ever put out and they've put
out some pretty good cases so that's
saying a lot coming from me of course
this is all subjective but honestly once
you build this thing you really get a
sense of how much time was invested into
the overall design and engineering there
are several areas that I critiqued
throughout my review but don't be
alarmed I think that just kind of comes
with the territory if you're gonna sell
a case for $180 you're opening up that
product to a lot more criticism and you
know even though I did have some remarks
about certain areas no case is perfect
of course I think that they're pretty
miniscule in the grand scheme of things
because this is overall a fantastic
product and everyone should go buy three
of them right now but that's pretty much
gonna conclude it for now guys thank you
