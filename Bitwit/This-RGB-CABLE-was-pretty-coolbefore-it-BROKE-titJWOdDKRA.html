guys Cal bet wood here welcome back to
the channel today I am taking a look at
something that I knew was coming years
ago and I feel like it started out as a
joke when the RGB craze initially hit
the PC market but now that joke has
become a terrifying reality that I'm
very glad to share with all of you today
so this is a prototype emphasis on
prototype from Lian Li which is
basically the world's first RGB cable
cable extension to be exact and they're
calling it the strimmer STR imer I feel
like there should be two M's in that
word if it's pronounced strimmer
streamer streamer just doesn't doesn't
roll off the tongue
anyway it's a 24-pin ATX extension for
your motherboard and we'll be taking a
closer look at it today so let's open
this guy up now I have actually unboxed
this already and tested it out but I'm
just unboxing it here on camera for you
guys for theatric purposes and there are
some things to note here about this
prototype right off the bat actually I
tried shooting this review earlier today
and in the middle of shooting it the
wire that was soldered on to the cable
came undone oh this just fella
it broke so it's broken which is why the
b-roll that we have for this video is
going to be pretty limited because we
didn't actually get to shooting every
get around to shooting everything before
it broke so let's just carry on with
this review as if it's a normal review
now there's still much to learn about
this cable there's a lot of information
that Liam Lee left out when they sent me
this sample such as pricing availability
I'm hoping that we find out more during
Computex which is right around the
corner though taking a closer look at
the cable we get some White's leaving
there's no heat shrink it's not fraying
so it's fairly high-quality it's not the
best I've seen but it's certainly decent
enough for most purposes and on the
other side we have what looks to be our
5 volt addressable RGB fiber optic
lighting housing array or whatever you
want to call it this is where the
illumination takes place and it's
basically consisting of these twelve
sort of transparent wires that go across
the entire extension and it looks like
it's fixed to the to the the wires of
the cable by the the cable combs there's
some custom cable combs here that it
sort of latches on to and it's a little
bit loose in certain area so hopefully
that's something that they iron out for
the final retail model as well this can
also be flipped it looks like you can
actually flip the the LED housing to the
other side of the cable based on
whatever motherboard that you're using
as not all boards have the ATX clip on
the same side so that's really nice that
they give you that sort of option and
then there's also let's let's talk about
the cable that fell off assuming that
this was connected it would actually
connect right here which is the closer
to the side of the connector that your
power supply cable would plug into and
from here you get a couple different
options on how to connect and control
the LEDs so for starters you have a
three pin connector that can connect to
the included controller that takes the
form of an expansion bracket which we'll
take a closer look at later and there's
also a three pin connector that you
could hook up to your motherboard
assuming your motherboard supports
addressable RGB devices and from there
you can use software like asus or sink
msi mystic light to control the LEDs
still no word on what softwares will be
supported but I guess more on that later
let's take a look at the actual
controller here which comes
the form of a PCI expansion bracket and
it's got three buttons on the back one
for LED mode or color mode another for
the effect speed and then one for memory
which it didn't really describe what
that was I'm guessing that's if you want
to create a memory profile or a lighting
profile so that when you reboot your
computer it remembers the the profile
that you were using last but I'm not
sure don't quote me on that and then we
also have the PCB that it's connected to
with a molex connector which is where it
gets its power in the spec sheet the
very limited spec sheet that Langley
gave me it actually said that this was
supposed to be SATA so I'm guessing for
the retail model we'll see say that in
place of this terrible hideous molex
connector and then you've got your cable
obviously for connecting it to the cable
itself so the other thing that I wanted
to say about this bracket is that when
we tried installing it we were running
into clearance issues with the PCB and
the PCI Express slots on our motherboard
had they just mounted the the PCB just
maybe an inch or so or even a couple
centimeters this way then that wouldn't
happen but we actually had to bend the
PCB quite significantly to go underneath
one of our PCIe slots in order to get
this installed flush with the case but
that's pretty much it guys again there's
not much else to say here it's nerdi bko
I think the most interesting thing about
this whole product is the way it looks
so without further ado here's some of
the b-roll that we were able to get
before it broke enjoy
well there you have it guys
it's an RGB cable it does RGB things now
it's time for you guys to sound off in
the comments and let me know what do you
think is this something that you would
spend your hard-earned dollars on how
much would you pay for an RGB 24 pin ATX
extension like this one or is this just
something else you know just another RGB
gimmick that that should be shunned
publicly and and burned in a valley of
fire I don't know but thank you guys so
much for watching this video again let
me know what you think about it in the
comments toss a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and also get subscribed so
you don't miss any more tech stuff
coming at you really soon you can also
follow me on Flo playing for three bucks
a month if you want to catch all my
videos a week early without ads I'll put
a link for that in the video description
till next time guys thank you so much
for tuning in have yourselves a good one
and I'll see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
