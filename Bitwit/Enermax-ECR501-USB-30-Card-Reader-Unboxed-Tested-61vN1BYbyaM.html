awesomesauce news today I'll be taking a
look at this mighty charger card reader
from inter max this is their ECR 5:01
and it's a USB 3.0 card reader which is
pretty cool
it also comes in a lower grade model the
ECR 3:01 which doesn't have quite as
many cool features as as this one does
but for today I'm going to be looking at
the 5:01 so here it is this is a six in
one Cod Rita they're the six different
card formats that it supports I'm just
going to go ahead and let you guys read
that for a sec I don't want to bore you
with all these all these little
different formats but there you have it
and let's take a look at some of the
main features that this device offers so
for starters you've got a USB
supercharge port which is actually that
green port to the far left right there
and this is basically for charging any
device that uses USB power to charge so
tablets and smartphones and things like
that can be charged very quickly with
this port they're claiming up to 80
percent faster than a normal USB port
with with this supercharged port which
is pretty cool it's also battery
I think it's battery charge a USB
battery charge specification compliant
which is version 1.2 which means it
outputs 2.4 amps which is really nice
you've also got a USB 3.0 port right
there and let's get back to the bottom
here so the card reader ports are
actually in USB 3.0 bandwidth now you
would think that's pretty obvious for a
USB 3.0 card reader but actually I've
seen a lot of card readers that
advertise themselves to be USB 3 but
only the USB 3 ports are actually wired
for that bandwidth and the card ports
themselves are wired for USB 2
connectivity which is a real bummer and
kind of misleading but that's not the
case for this card reader so kudos to
enter max for getting that right you've
also got five just general USB 2.0 ports
there but they also output 1.5 amps so
if you are occupying the supercharged
port you want to charge some other
secondary devices you can go ahead and
charge them with these USB 2.0 ports and
it will actually charge quite a bit
faster than a standard USB port which is
also very nice and the last but not
least you have a very unique feature on
this card reader you can actually
install two two and a half inch drives
and one three and a half inch drive to
the back of this thing so they're stored
internally
that really kind of makes this card
reader a multi-purpose device that
offers just a lot of different
functionality for I think the 35 bucks
that you pay for it currently so with
that said I'm going to take it out of
the box and we're going to have a closer
look all right so here's everything
that's included in the package first off
you've got your installation guide right
here pretty straightforward if you've
ever installed anything inside of a five
and a quarter inch Bay before I'm sure
you won't really need this too much but
there it is just in case we've also got
some mounting screws to install the card
reader itself as well as any drives that
you might be installing into the card
reader so there you go and here's the
card reader boom there it is so it's got
a nice matte black finish it kind of
looks texturized it's got kind of a
texturized pattern to it but it's
nothing too distracting I actually
personally like it it's made of plastic
but it doesn't feel cheap at all it
actually feels very well built it's very
strong and sturdy it's thick plastic it
doesn't bend or anything like that which
is also very nice so here's just a look
we're going to go down from left to
right your supercharged port on the very
left USB USB 3.0 port as well as your
five USB 2.0 ports up top you have your
card ports which are USB 3.0 bandwidth
supported as well as an eSATA port there
off to the right which is a nice touch
and there's one more look at the side or
you can drill in those holes or screw in
those holes mounted to your five into
quarter inch Bay on the flip side of the
card reader you've got some cables here
molex for power and sorry guys it's a
little blurry because I have autofocus
on since my cameraman is off for the day
I'm kind of roughing it so just bear
with me you got USB 3.0 of course and
all these by the way plugged directly
into your motherboard you've got that
SATA cable for your eSATA port at the
front as well as USB 2.0 so there you go
and here's actually where you mount
those three drives so I don't know if
you can tell right here but you actually
mount the two two-and-a-half inch drives
at the bottom one right here and the
other right next to it and just above
that is where you mount that three and a
half inch drive it's kind of hard to see
black on black or whatever but I'm going
to show you guys an installation right
now
and voila your drives are installed
you've got your 3.5 inch drive up top
here 2.5 inch drives at the bottom the
3.5 inch drive does stick out about two
inches past the end of the card reader
which is fairly expected card readers
generally aren't that long anyway and
you probably won't run into any
clearance issues with any other
components in your case the only thing I
can think of is if you have a really
small case and you have a memory stick
right here that might interfere but
honestly I think you should be alright
especially if you use like a right-angle
SATA data cable right here and for power
that they're generally like ribbon style
cables or they're really thin or
flexible so honestly you shouldn't run
into any clearance issues with having
installed that 3.5 inch drive alright so
I just finished installing the card
reader and just as I predicted there
were no clearance issues with the other
components particularly the RAM as you
can see there's plenty of space here
even if you were to plug in your SATA
cables you'd have no problem getting it
all in there
I did want to mention that I did install
it on the lower five-minute quarter inch
drive bay in the define hour for because
if I'd installed on the top I'd just be
a little bit more pressed for space with
that radiator from the h100 I put those
fans sticking out I still could have
gotten it in there no problem but just
for the sake of convenience and to get
this video up quickly I just installed
it right there to save a bit of time
just something I wanted to point out and
I couldn't help but test out the
transfer speeds of this card reader now
the speeds here are going to be largely
dependent on and attributed to the x99
chipset which is controlling all this
USB 3 bandwidth natively but I still
wanted to test out the card readers to
make sure it was working properly and
whatnot so I stuck an SD card in there
with a 4 gig file and was able to
transfer it to the SSD on my system in
about a minute and a half about a minute
and 32 seconds to be exact which is a
completely reasonable and acceptable
speed especially if it means that I
don't have to use this damn dongle all
the time and it's just completely built
in and ready to go that's going to
actually save me a lot of headache and
hassle I did want to test out the
charging port the supercharge port here
just to see how what all the hypes about
since the enter Max's seemed to be
advertising it quite a bit I'm just
going to see if the claims are true and
I think my phone's about to die so I'm
going to test that alright so after
doing the
I found the supercharged port to charge
my phone from 0 to 100 in about just
over two hours actually which is pretty
good and a regular USB 2.0 port took
five and a half hours about five hours
and 20 minutes to be exact and that was
using the USB 2.0 port on the case the
the built-in USB port there not the 1.4
amp USB 2 2.0 port on the card reader
itself because that would have charged
quite a bit faster so all in all if you
do the math that's about two and a half
times faster using the supercharged port
than a standard USB 2.0 port so it's
actually pretty good I think I'm going
to start using the supercharged port
quite a bit more now just because it's
it's a lot more convenient for me to
have my phone charging right next to me
that I can put it on my desk as opposed
to having it plugged into a wall socket
somewhere and having it you know more
than an arm's reach away from me so all
in all a very solid card reader that
does what it promises and honestly I
can't think of a better way to spend
thirty five bucks if you had a free five
and a quarter inch bay just sitting
there once again this has been the enter
max ECR five zero one USB 3.0 card

time I'll see you in the next video
