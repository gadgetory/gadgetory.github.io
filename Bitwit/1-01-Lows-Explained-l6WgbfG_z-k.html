doing well so some of you may have
noticed that I recently switched at my
benchmarking methodology about several
weeks ago by discontinuing the
presentation of minimum frame rates in
favor of 1% and 0.1% lows but since then
I've seen a lot of confusion in the
comments as to what exactly these
metrics mean so today I'm going to
explain what they are and why you should
care about them the first thing to
realize here is that minimum frame rates
are pure garbage which I'll expand on
later and secondly average frame rates
alone don't tell the whole story because
they're not all created equal that's why
an average of 80 FPS on one PC can
sometimes look or feel worse than 60 FPS
on another clearly there is another
metric at play here that's missing from
this graph and so many others like it
and that metric is called frame times
which is a concept that was heavily
pushed by Scott Watson formerly of tech
report as a means of measuring
performance and while I'm going to sum
it up as best as I can today I've linked
his detailed article on the matter in
the description for those of you
interested
now frame times are simply the number of
milliseconds between frames which
technically means that they can be
represented as a frame rate by basic
arithmetic a sixteen point six six
millisecond frame time would equate to
60 FPS with lower frame times indicating
higher frame rates now to see how this
metric impacts performance let's use our
first hypothetical PC let's say the
first frame it renders stays on the
screen for 10 milliseconds then frame 2
appears for another 10 milliseconds so
far so good but when frame 3 comes
around there's a technical hiccup of
some sort which causes it to stay on
screen for 80 milliseconds and suddenly
this drastic spike in frame times breaks
the once fluid illusion of motion it's
kind of like a flipbook getting stuck
for a moment on one of its pages if this
behavior is repeatable the game can
quickly become unplayable and what's
worse is that this can occur but still
output a favorable average frame rate
which makes average FPS a poor metric
for measuring user experience when frame
times aren't accounted for
now taking a look at our second
hypothetical PC that scored 60 FPS on
average you can see frame 1 appears for
around 16 milliseconds as does frame 2
in fact all the frames are pretty evenly
spaced apart which provides an overall
smoother experience than PC number 1
despite having higher frame times
overall so it's not necessarily just
about having the lowest possible frame
times but having frame times that are
consistent with minimal variance between
one another
how should we attempts to measure this
you ask enter one percent end point one
percent loads which getting to the meat
of this video is just a short way of
saying the slowest one percent in 0.1
percent of frames that occurred during a
run since most built-in benchmarks these
days lack any frame time monitoring
capabilities I use a combination of
fraps and fraps to free lightweight
utilities which can handle these tasks
so after recording and analyzing a
particular benchmark run fraps picks out
the slowest 1% of frames based on their
frame times averages said frame times
and presents that value as a frame rate
then it's rinse and repeat with 0.1% of
the slowest frames what you end up with
are two values that illustrate a group
of crappy frames with 1% lows being the
group that comes around more often that
you're more likely to notice
additionally the larger the gap between
these values and your average frame rate
the more likely your gameplay will
suffer which is why a video card that
yields similar or even slightly worse
averages may still be the better choice
if it delivers an overall tighter frame
output now I have to give credit where
credit is due this one in point 1%
presentation style was heavily
popularized by Steven Burke and the team
at gamers Nexus they saw the value in
Scott walkins testing methods but
realize the average user would find
frame time charts a bit confusing so
they began converting the frame times
back into FPS at their 1% in point 1%
values to make the data more relatable
and easier to digest
gamers Nexus does some great work so
I'll throw down a few links to their
website and channel in the description
at this point it should be pretty clear
why measuring a sample size of slow
frames is more sensible than looking at
a single minimum frame rate I mean it
pains me to think that I ever gave any
attention to a single frame for so long
and yet it sucks it's the worst of all
the frames
and for that it should be beaten and
publicly ridiculed but in no way does
that tell you anything about your gaming
experience because it's not a repeatable
behavior just one frame nor is it
reliable I mean you could run that same
benchmark again and you might yield a
drastically different frame rate the
second time around which is why this
metric is an outlier that draws no real
conclusions on overall performance
okay the minimum frame rate is like a
random fat guy who just stumbled into a
10k marathon
all right you wouldn't see him in a
crowd of thousands of in shape runners
and think what a sluggish Bunch
no he probably just got lost on his way
to Blizzcon or something all right he's
an outlier so everyone just stopped
giving a shit about minimum frame rates
but that's pretty much the gist of it
and hopefully that clears some things up
I personally plan to keep one percent in
point one percent loads in my testing
methodology as long as they continue
providing valuable insight into the
hardware that I review or until
something better comes along to replace
them if you're still a little confused
on anything feel free to leave any
questions you might have in the comments
and I'll do my very best to look through
them and answer them when I get a chance
before you guys go don't forget to toss
me a like on the video if you enjoyed it
and also feel free to check out bit wit
ultra where you can watch videos like
this one early without ads for a buck
video month totally worked
maybe definitely not as always them goes
up no I'm still doing that though is I'm
gala bid with thank you guys for
watching subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and I'll see y'all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
