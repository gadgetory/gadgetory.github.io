video so it's gonna be low energy and
probably I'm gonna be a little off and
stuff more than I usually am so if
you're not cool with me getting sick or
you're afraid you're gonna catch a cold
through the camera or something just
turn back now you've been warned
so hey hey how's it going everyone this
is the r-tx 2060 it just launched right
when you're watching this if you're
watching this on the day of upload and
it's from Nvidia of course it's their
new r-tx 2060 I already said that we're
gonna test it and we're gonna compare it
against other cards to see if it's any
good and if you should buy one so what's
going on with this thing man it's like
supposed to be three hundred and
forty-nine dollars according to Nvidia
which is probably not true it's probably
gonna be more than that we'll talk about
that later
it's featuring the same tu 106 GPU
that's found in the RT X 2070 but of
course it's been it's been nerfed it's
been nerfed a bit so not as many cuda
cores now as many sm's and so forth i
does support however just like the RT x
2070 ray tracing and d LSS and other
technologies that you can't really use
all that much right now but you might be
able to use them in the near future or
in the far future we don't know it's
just one of those things you don't know
there's some specs on this thing like I
said it's got a slightly fewer CUDA
cores than the RT X 27 t at 1920 versus
the 2070 s 20 304 it's got a few less
r-tx ops and one less Giga ray so you
know you know how that goes boos clock
is 1600 and 80 megahertz versus the RT X
27 TS 1710 bear in mind that this is a
founders Edition card so it is factory
overclocked and you can see this card
only has a 6 gig frame buffer of GDD our
six and that's two less gigs than all
the other cards on this chart right here
but unlike the GTX 10 series cards it is
gddr5 so cheese is gddr5 no it's GDD are
six memory instead of gddr5 memory and I
forgot to hit record on that camera damn
it
the second camera this was supposed to
be recording
second sticks on the stupid pecan so
it's only got six gigs but it's GDD are
six whereas ten series only had gddr5
and it's faster memory to rated at 14
gigabits per second as opposed to a
gigabits per second with the 10 series
1070 at 772 I it's the same speed as the
RT X 2070 in that sense it also has more
memory bandwidth than the 1070 and a
1070 ti but a more narrow bus with 192
bit as opposed to 256 bit on those 10
series cards as far as thermal design
power goes this is a 160 watt TDP card
let's talk about the card itself
founders Edition cards it's the same
similar cooler it's shorter though do I
have it I have an RT X 2080 right here I
don't have an RT X 2070 because Nvidia
never sent me one no idea why they send
me a 2080 and a 20 ATI but no love from
the 2070 so that kind of is weird so
look you can see it's it's like 2080 is
quite a bit longer maybe by two two and
a half inches or so I don't know how
long the 27 because again didn't get one
but it's a it's good you can fit and
probably like smaller form factor cases
I'm sure especially because those are
accommodating longer and longer GPUs
these days dual fan design it's got a
single six pin no single 8 pin I like
8-pin connector on the side so it's on
the side now and see that that's
different back plates still there rear
i/o is the same you get to DisplayPort
one HDMI USB type-c for virtual link and
a dual link DVI port no Envy link SLI
bridge or finger here so you can't put
two of these together at the same time
obviously why would you do that anyway
alright huh so over it I tested five
different games 1920 by 1080 and 2560 by
1440 I ran all the benchmarks for this
card in my 9900 K test bed that CPU was
overclocked to 5 gigahertz 16 gigs and I
mean you can read right I tested it
against two different cards including
the Asus Cerebrus Cerebrus Cerberus
Cerberus gtx 1070 TI and a galaxy x 1070
i've been tested against the gtx 1080
because
all these cards were run stock at their
out-of-the-box frequencies but bear in
mind all three cards do come factory
overclocked so there's that and let's
just see how they did
so I added up all the frames across all
five games at 1080p and you can see here
that the gtx 1070 TI performed about 7.2
percent better on average than the gtx
1070 and the r-tx 2060 performed ever so
slightly less than that 6.9 percent
better so the 2060 and the 1070 TI we're
very close neck-and-neck
obviously the 1070 TI edges it out ever
so slightly here that could be chalked
up to margin there but let's take a look
at the Morton hinge for you I gotta
click the thing alright so 10% it's
almost the same story here except the
r-tx 2060 does a little bit better this
time around at 1440p and the gtx 1070 i
but they're really close I mean they're
so close you know it's like the
performance is almost identical here the
trade and blows yeah if you look at the
pricing here I have an asterisks here
but I don't have any like explanation of
why the asterisks there so I'll just
tell you these are the lowest prices I
could find on these cards at the time of
filming across Amazon and Newegg so the
gtx 1070 to be had right now for about
three hundred and ten dollars gtx 1070
TI for 439 RT x 2070 for $4.99 and the
RT x 2060 we have no idea at the time of
filming what you're actually gonna be
able to buy this card for on the day of
launch or just today so here's here's
the way I see it if you have like it's
not gonna be 349 I think it's gonna be
closer to $400 maybe 450 which at that
point if it's 450 that's that's silly
you should just get an RT X 2070 at that
point but if it looks okay let's break
this down if it's 350 dollars let's say
hypothetically Nvidia pull some magic
out of their butts and is able to sell
this card for 349 dollars it's a steal
buy it buy it over the gtx 1070 buy it
over the gtx 1070 TI that's
hypothetically if it's at 349 bucks if
you can get it for like $400 i would
still say go for it because that's still
cheaper than what you can get a 1070 TI
for and they're about the same
performance if you're just talking about
raw frame rates and you still get that
you get the whole r-tx
of crap now let's create another
hypothetical situation here let's say
that you were able to find a gtx 1070 TI
for $400 on sale or something like that
and the RT x 2060 was priced at 425
dollars is that 25 extra dollars worth
it when the cards let's say assuming
from these tests they're performing
about the same why would you pay the
extra $25 for the r TX 2060 well it's
got the new architecture and it's got
that new suite of r-tx technology like
ray tracing and DL SS and so forth so if
that appeals to you if that having
access to that is worth the extra 25
bucks or X amount of dollars however
much it is then obviously you should go
that route if all you care about is raw
performance however then just go with
the cheaper card because the frame rates
gonna be about the same anyway you're
gonna have to face that fork in the road
on your own I can't make that decision
for you it's gonna boil down to how
interested you are in ray tracing and
and really the promise of it because
there's there's kind of two schools of
thought right now there's one that's
like you know I'm gonna invest in ray
tracing now I'm gonna buy an RT X card
even though there's like one supported
game for it because when those other
games finally roll out I'll be able to
play it immediately I want to buy new
hardware I'll be good to go right and
then there's the other school of thought
that's like you know you know I'm not
gonna pay $1 more on a suite of
technologies that isn't ready yet I'm
gonna wait for that stuff for those
games to roll up that I really want to
play that support rate racing I'm gonna
wait for it to get here before I spend
any money on hardware that that's
required to run it so you know whatever
whichever one you fall into it's up to
you but if you're just looking at raw
performance this is a good card and also
a good card depends on the price right
depends on what it's being sold for so
as far as just raw performance it stays
competitive with the gtx 1070 TI and you
know i'm sure in some cases under
certain conditions it can probably even
catch a gtx 1080 but for the most part i
think ten seventy TI performance is what
you're getting out of this card so you
guys let me know what you think that's
that's all i got i'm gonna go like chug
a gallon of orange juice and pop some
pills or something it sounds terrible
thank you guys for watching this video
I'm sorry so sorry that it's just it's
been this yeah I'm just so blah today
but you know
whatever thank you guys for watching
toss like on the video if you enjoyed it
get subscribed for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and I'll catch
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
