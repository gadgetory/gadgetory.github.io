the news NVIDIA recently gave birth to
the latest member of their Maxwell GPU
family the GTX 950 the new card retails
for about 160 USD competing directly
with AMD s r7 370 and much like its arch
nemesis the gtx 950 targets 1080 gaming
at high settings which is where a vast
majority of us PC gamers currently stand
now unfortunately I don't actually have
an r7 370 on hand to conduct a proper
bench off but then again a budget gamer
might not necessarily be faced with the
age-old question of team red versus team
green for about 50 bucks more the gtx
960 brings a bit more power to the table
but still falls in line with 1080 gaming
so assuming you've got a full HD monitor
at home and you're in the market for a
geforce card does the added performance
of a gtx 960 warrant the higher price
tag over a gtx 950 which one do you
choose
well rhetorical questions ever get old
these are the questions that must be
answered and today i've called upon the
aid of my zou tech gtx 960 and this EVGA
gtx 950 super super clock to help me do
just that
so starting things off with a quick look
at the specs we can see here that the
gtx 950 uses a cut-down version of the
GM 206 the very same chip found in the
gtx 960 having one of its SM shaders
disabled results in 33% fewer CUDA cores
and texture units which is our biggest
indication of the performance gap here
the referenced gtx 950 has a base clock
of a thousand and 24 megahertz and a
boost clock of eleven hundred and eighty
eight while our factory overclocked EVGA
model boasts an impressive boost clock
just south of 1400 megahertz
apart from a slower memory clock
frequency the memory specs of both
reference models are identical sporting
two gigs of gddr5 on a 128-bit bus
however the gtx 950 only consumes 75% of
the power as its bigger brother making
it incredibly power efficient with its
single 6-pin pci ii connector though our
EVGA card rocks an 8 pin plug for
additional overclocking in addition to
all of the usual Nvidia technologies
like dynamic super resolution g-sync and
game works the gtx 950 can also
advantage of the new MFA a filter which
delivers image quality on par with 4x
MSAA
at a cost that's closer to 2x MSAA what
you essentially have here is the ability
to achieve good looks through low impact
who ever thought anything would bridge
the gap between video games in Bikram
yoga other notable features include hdmi
2.0 for 4k signal at 60 Hertz and
support for DirectX 12 with the feature
level 12.1 now take a moment to compare
this to the r7 370 s HDMI 1.4 a lower
feature level and lack of racing support
and the budget maxwell card begins to
sound a bit more enticing now diving
right into the performance of our Nvidia
cards I overclocked both contenders as
far as I could take them landing me at
fourteen hundred and ninety five
megahertz on the zotac gtx 960 and a
blazing fifteen hundred and seventy
eight megahertz on the gtx 950 this is
undoubtedly in part thanks to e BGA's
beefed-up
a CX 2.0 cooler it's nice to see that
maxwell retains its astounding
overclocked ability with nvidia x'
latest card now all tests were run with
a 5820k and x99 gaming g1 motherboard at
the target resolution of 1920 by 1080
using the latest game ready wickel
drivers on Windows 8.1 without further
ado let's queue up some soothing sounds
of the ancient lute while we take a look
at the benchmarks
all right well I think it's safe to
conclude from our results that the GTX
950 can in fact handle most of today's
games at 1080p at high settings our card
easily topped 45 fps in every game with
the exception of hitman absolution which
honestly isn't half bad considering we
ran the test on ultra with 4x msaa
with all the loose guarantees of the GTX
980 and 390 X being 4k ready it's nice
to finally see a car that delivers
exactly what it promises a smooth gaming
experience of 1080 with some eye candy
to boot when all is said and done the
GTX 960 performed about 18% better on
average than our aggressively
overclocked GTX 950 that performance
gain comes at a cost however about 30%
to be exact so when we take a look at
these raw numbers is the premium price
tag of the gtx 960 really worth it I
mean of course the answer will vary from
user to user but I personally feel that
the gtx 950 packs more bang for the buck
in the long run it's no secret that the
memory specs and gaming performance of
the gtx 960 fell somewhat short of our
expectations when it launched back in
january which as of today puts it much
closer to the gtx 950 than its high-end
neighbor the gtx 970 in some ways this
alignment puts the gtx 960 in a weird
position as gtx 950 users probably won't
see noticeable gameplay improvements or
enjoy higher resolutions until upgrading
to the likes of a gtx 970 or an r9 390
at the same time this is great news for
budget gamers who now have a new means
of solid 1080 gameplay at a sizable
discount for this reason and many others
the gtx 950 deserves all the praise and
approval that the gtx 960 initially
missed out on but let me know what you
guys think of this new card from nvidia
