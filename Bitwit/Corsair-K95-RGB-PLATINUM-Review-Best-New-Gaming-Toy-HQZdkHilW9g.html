why don't you I want you to do one of
those tricks that I taught you for the
camera oh that's right you don't know
any because you're dumb dumb you just
sit there you don't pay rent you don't
do anything you don't do anything wait
whoa what who okay who in the right mind
just leaves this here like come on
seriously well I guess we should unbox
it all right this is the Corsair k95 RGB
platinum and as you're all very aware
any gaming peripheral with the word
platinum in it is clearly 100%
infallible in every way shape or form
but just to verify we're going to be
taking a closer look at it today and
seeing all the new fun features that
come along with it because there are
quite a few and despite there being many
similarities between this and the
original k95 RGB Corsair has taken a lot
of user feedback to heart made a lot of
revisions that weren't so hot with the
original k95 RGB and fix them with this
board as well as added some new features
that you guys are probably never seeing
unless you were watching all the CES
coverage on this particular model so
with that said should be a very fun
board to check out mechanical of course
we've got some cherry MX speed switches
which are currently advertised as being
the fastest mechanical switch on the
market we'll take a closer look at that
as well if you're watching this video
right now which obviously you are this
keyboard should be available right now
worldwide in black at the very least if
you happen to be living in North America
then you'll also have the option to get
it in gunmetal gray they may extend that
availability to a world wide release at
a later date but keep your ear to the
ground for that MSRP 199 199 USD that's
not cheap by by any stretch so we are
talking about a high-end keyboard here
that is pretty much cream of the crop
when it comes to mechanical gaming
keyboards these days so whether or not
it's going to be worth your hard-earned
dollars is like always going to heavily
depend on your needs as a user in order
for you to figure that out and decide
whether or not you should buy this we
have to take a look at all those
features first so why don't we take this
out of the box and have a closer look so
here's the keyboard plugged into a PC
that I've got back there you can see
kind of just defaults to this rainbow
wave sort of effect as far as the
backlighting goes and these are of
course individual
back wit you can customize each
individual keeper key lighting so to
speak so that's really nice pretty much
familiar with what we've seen on
previous RGB boards from course share
you can see they've actually enlarged
the lettering the cutouts on the
lettering just a bit to allow more light
to bleed through which is really nice it
looks very very bright and vibrant and
all that sort of thing the LEDs are not
the LED bulbs themselves are not visible
whatsoever it's very nice even in
diffused glow and also the aluminum
chassis that we're dealing with here is
pretty familiar for the most part but
there are some big notable changes first
of which being this light bar that kind
of goes across the back end here and
even kind of curves around to the sides
of the edges there this is really nice
it's actually got 19 different zones
that are configurable and customizable
within the cue software of course and
you can actually program those
independent of the keys themselves or
you can sync them all together there's
actually quite a bit you can do with
this light bar in terms of just the
different lighting effects and what
we'll play around with those in just a
bit
apart from that you've also got this
nice Corsair logo here which has kind of
a glossy finish which I'm okay with
because it's so small and pretty
discreet but that's also you can see
backlit illuminated with RGB lighting of
course now one of the main revisions
that I really like about this keyboard
is that there's now only one column of
programmable G keys whereas in the past
the original k95 RGB had three columns
which for my needs as a user it was just
a bit overkill plus it added quite a bit
of whisk to the profile to keyboard
itself and was and quite frankly was one
of the reasons why I never went with a
k95 for my daily driver because I have
limited desk space so this kind of gives
you the best of both worlds there they
are fully programmable you can do macros
you can launch applications they are
fully backlit as well just like the rest
of the keys with cherry MX speed
switches and all that jazz they do have
this kind of gray textured finish I
don't mind the texture at all but I
would prefer them to be black just to be
more cohesive with the rest of the keys
on the board in the top left corner of
the keyboard you get three buttons one
of which is your Windows lock key we've
also got brightness adjustments with
four different levels of brightness
including off which is nice if you want
to go stealth and then finally you've
got this button on the very left which
is new this is a new addition this
actually allows you to switch between
three different user defined profiles
via the hardware so there's eight
megabytes of on-board storage you've got
a 30
two bit ARM Cortex processor that's
handling all the lighting effects macros
all that sort of thing so even if you
plug this into a different computer that
doesn't have the cue software loaded up
onto it you can still have up to three
user defined profiles to switch between
on the fly at any time which is super
handy moving on over to the right side
of the keyboard here you've got your
mute button as well as a new and
improved volume knob it does feel very
nice to the touch it Scrolls and glides
along with ease and just beneath that
you've got four multimedia keys just
like you had on the original board
however these are raised there now a
little bit elevated so that you just get
easier access I remember on the on my
k95 arm sorry on my k70 rapidfire which
have the older style of multimedia keys
if I'm leaning back too far in my chair
the top row of number keys on the numpad
actually kind of overshadow the
multimedia keys because they're just so
low to the board itself and make them a
little bit less accessible than I'd like
them to be so that's kind of been solved
here with this raised sort of platform
now due to popular demand Corsair has
brought back the USB 2.0 pass-through
port which is located right on the back
of the keyboard next to the braided
cable it's a very nice I believe is six
foot maybe a six foot braided cable with
the US two USB type a connectors at the
end one for the keyboard of course and
the other for the pass-through port now
the pass-through port is very useful for
things like connecting your gaming mouse
or maybe even a wireless receiver for
your gaming headset however if you were
wanting to connect a wired headset to
that port Corsair has you covered
they've actually thought this through
quite a bit always one step ahead by
including this kind of cross channel on
the underbelly of the keyboard itself so
you can route the cable directly
underneath the board instead of having
to just let it dangle and hang around up
at the top of your keys where it could
easily get in the way while your games
so I might have to swap out my k7
rapid-fire for this as my daily driver
for that feature alone if nothing else
before I forget there's also two fold
out underneath the keyboard with rubber
pads underneath them to keep it from
slipping and sliding around if you just
want to give your board a little bit
more of an ergonomic incline while
you're gaming or typing but the cooler
thing that I want to talk about is the
wrist rest here this is a
new-and-improved wrist rest it snaps on
very easily boom
it's that's it it's super easy it's not
a magnet or anything it's so just a
latch mechanism but you just place the
keyboard down yet the fiddle with it too
much
taking it out is a little bit more
difficult you kind of got to like pull
the gotta like squeeze together a little
the little latches I do which the
latches were metal just to make it a bit
more secure feeling when you are
detaching it but attaching it is super
super easy and the cool thing about this
wrist rest the other nice thing is that
depending on which surface your dainty
wrist prefers there is an inlay here
that's magnetic you could just pop it
out and either have a very smooth finish
for your wrist or a more bumpy textured
surface so whatever your heart's content
there it is again
perfectly magnetic slots and really
easily I do wish there was like a little
tiny tab just so you can kind of grab it
and get an easier grip on it to peel it
up initially but once you flip it and
once you set it your the way you prefer
it's probably going to stay there for
forever for the most part so I think the
other thing that I want to mention
before we dive into the software and
just take a look at some of the RGB
effects is are the mechanical switches
of course it's easy to forget them
because they're hidden most of the time
but there you go they're Cherry MX speed
as I as I mentioned before one point two
millimeters actuation distance 45 grams
of operating force and a crazy
ridiculous durability of over 50 million
keystrokes so this thing will be lasting
you quite a while to say the least let's
go ahead and jump into the software now
and take this bad boy for a spin alright
so here we are in the q software and
really quick I forgot to mention that
this board also features any key
rollover and 100% anti-ghosting so you
never have to worry about pressing too
many keys at once all those keystrokes
will be registered no problem but here
we are in the software looks a lot
different than when I last used it about
a year ago with my original k70 RGB it
looks a lot better
it looks more user-friendly the UI looks
Gorge compared to what it used to look
like and I think it's
actually a lot more functional as well
easier to navigate that sort of thing so
this is just a really quick basic look
I'm not going to go to the detail here
this could be is this is a really a
video on its own just a cue software but
some of the presets here you've got
about a dozen or so to choose from lots
of variety if you just want to fire
something up really quick
boom to do boom boom boom little bit of
a boom boom boom boom okay pipe gliding
all all the good stuff you've also got
these three user profiles these are the
hardware profiles that we mentioned
earlier that you can switch between
using the button a little onboard button
on your keyboard isn't that nice that's
super cool and also there is the
Advanced Mode for all of you hardcore
lighting effect users out there who want
to just you know really tweak and and
tune your your LEDs to make them your
own I did fire up something right here
here we go as I just whip this up in a
minute or two these are just random
effects that I applied with you know
typical hot line colors you can see that
there's just a lot going on here you can
really make everything act independently
of each other we've got the G keys that
are seizuring out here and whites we've
got a nice ripple effect in the middle
here with kind of the teal and pink and
then just a bunch of other things going
on here you can see the light bar also
is doing its own sort of pulsing effect
and I did want to mention that the
Corsair logo here that's just one of the
xix owns that also is sharing the the
top middle part top middle portion of
that bar actually and that's I got that
illuminated right there should unclick
that there so it's better and finally
here's a quick look at all the different
actions that you can apply to any of
these keys not just the GPS but any one
of these keys on the board is
programmable guys so whether you talk in
macros text remapping Keys media
functions launching applications having
a timer if you want to give yourself
some cues while you're in game disabling
the key entirely and profile switching
they're all pretty much any of these
keys can do any of those actions so
pretty sweet overall let's go ahead and
wrap this video out with some closing
words so to sum up my thoughts on the
k95 RGB platinum in a nutshell in my
opinion it is currently the best gaming
mechanical keyboard you can buy for $200
whether or not you should spend $200 on
a key
is entirely up to you and depending on
again whether or not you're going to use
half of the features that this thing
offers but if you do have 200 bucks to
spend and let's say you're upgrading
from a $50 crap keyboard that maybe has
membrane keys that's just way too old
and outdated in need of a change then
this is a very good option that will
probably last you a super long time I
always tell people if you're going to
buy an office chair spend a lot of money
on it because you'll be using it
everyday the same goes for your keyboard
however the thing said if you already
own like a k70 or k95 RGB it's probably
not worth upgrading to the platinum
because there's just not enough new
stuff to make the investment worthwhile
but again you're coming from a potato
keyboard this is a fatty upgrade that's
going to last you a very long time and
I'm sure most of you guys will be very
happy with it as well the features of
super solid build quality and quite
frankly one of the most if not the most
sophisticated software for keyboard in
terms of both macro programmable
functionality and lighting effects if
you're into that sort of thing so those
are my thoughts on the k95 RGB platinum
guys let me know in the comments whether
or not you agree and feel free to toss
me a like on the video if you enjoyed it
that's all for now y'all thank you for
watching subscribe if you haven't
already for more tech stuff coming at
you really soon and I will see y'all in
