the description to catch this exciting
drop before it ends what's going on guys
welcome back to the channel so I like to
think that I have a pretty good idea of
which products are coming in and which
ones are going out but every now and
then a vendor will ship me a box or some
sort of package that I wasn't expecting
nor have any idea of what could be
inside so this is one of those occasions
I just got this today it arrived on our
doorstep here at the office studio from
Asus it says Republic of gamers very
proudly on one side so we know it's not
an AMD graphics card that's for sure
and it says ship 2 bit whit on the other
in the same sort of red spray-painted
font and there's a giant ROG logo on top
it's a pretty nice-looking box it's all
wood and it's got these nice fold out
handles on the side that are very sturdy
metal handles and it's actually a pretty
heavy package but I have no idea if that
weight is from the box itself or
whatever's inside and so seeing is how
I'm excited to invoke this right now I
felt I would share the experience with
all of you because I'm sure you're dying
to know just as much as me what could be
inside so let's dive right in shall we
starting with the packaging strap ah
making sure to cut away from the eyes
and face here we go
buckle and I think that's the only thing
left securing the box ok alright ready
let's coming off people here we go
Wow interesting okay the RG Strix fusion
500 RGB 7.1 surround gaming headset
alright
so that's that's the thing I wasn't
aware of this product we also have the
optical Gaming Mouse ROG Gladius to
origin look at that it's getting a
little crowded on this table right now
let me clear some stuff up there's more
things in here they've got a whole sort
of peripherals kit going on
the ROG scabbard which wait this is a
mousepad box that has no mousepad in it
it's an empty box oh wait here this is
the ROG scabbard Cordura fabric Corre
Dora Corre Dora looks like it's a fairly
large one perhaps it's one of those
extra wide ones for your keyboard as
well and then finally we have a
mechanical gaming keyboard this is the
RO jaques no ro chicks what the heck is
that the ROG Strix Flair RGB max RGB
it's got mechanical keys looks like
they're RGB red switches genuine Cherry
MX beautiful and looks like you got a
customizable logo here that you can
probably 3d print and add your own a
nice wrist rest not sure if the body is
aluminum or not
why don't we unbox the keyboard while
we're here why not
we've already unboxed this box and by
the way if you guys are wondering I
don't really know what to do with these
very cool but super large packages that
vendors sometimes send me so they
usually just get put into the storage
closet and never seen again but this is
exciting let's crack this guy open taken
for a whirl maybe we can even plug it in
and see what the LEDs look like all lit
up a soos or a sync compatible buy of
course very nice packaging if it's a
very premium feel looks like we also
have USB pass-through Hey
Oh fancy fancy fancy fancy pretty nice
it's got some pop-out feet and it's
rubber so it doesn't slip around blue
video haha feels good feels like
cherries oh you feel so cherry looks
like we've got a windows lock key
brightness adjustment multimedia volume
rocker very nice it's kind of got it's a
plastic body but it does have some
weight to it create the RGB LEDs looks
pretty good really liking all the little
details on this keyboard so far I mean
the under glow lighting looks really
nice you've got two strips on either
side I'm sure that's customizable you
probably disable it as well we've also
got some ROG branding sort of itched
into the side of the space bar here
looks really cool and two-tone design
you got brushed on one side very clean
on the other in terms of the body makes
it look like aluminium but it's not it's
actually plastic you got a brightness
windows lock key again and then I just
noticed the volume rocker actually has a
click so that's probably clicked to mute
and you can probably reprogram that as
well very nice keyboard well I think
it's time to wrap things up guys so I
want to say a huge shout outs and thanks
to Asus for sending all this stuff over
can't wait to play with the pile of
these new toys and yeah thanks to all of
you for watching this was fun this was
super fun we should do this all the time
we can do it every day no that's
probably too much alright nevermind but
hey tell us like on the video if you
enjoyed it get subscribed in Yatta Yatta
Yatta so you don't miss any more stuff
coming to the channel very very soon and
I will see you guys in the next video
have a good day why am I so hyper right
now
I think this wooden box was laced with
narcotics why it smells so familiar
