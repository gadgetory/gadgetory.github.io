from California to Boston Massachusetts
for PAX East I'm really excited I'm
super pumped I can't wait to get there
see you guys bright and early it's gonna
be awesome
I'm dying I don't want to go we're both
gonna do documentaries no only you I'm
too lazy me that guys Paul doesn't think
you guys worth it that's not what I said
at all right before I hit record he was
like I don't think they're working well
maybe I would make a documentary if Kyle
would let me use the flip the talent the
flip and I don't know what's a handy or
method is like just pulling a camera out
of your pocket taking some video
flip using the football driving don't
try this at home kids the hell we going
so we left new egg about five seconds
ago and we're in Home Depot it seems
like any time we go on a trip we just
have to make like a pit stop to some
random store to get one last item that
that we need for our trip so right now
we are looking for food you're not
allowed to record in a retail
environment well thank you for telling
me that employee is boiling a
documentary because I'm not making one
Wow that's just like Paul isn't it guys
well we're looking for two screwdrivers
and two flashlights and that's precisely
for the build contest this isn't what we
were looking for Paul these air
compressors this is not the air
compressor you're looking for if you
guys are gonna be at the build off that
we're going to be hosting at at PAX
you're gonna need one of these
screwdrivers and it's partly gonna be
dark as hell on there so we're gonna get
us some flashlights aren't we nice army
nice to our fans Paul yes
Hey look with screwdrivers sponsored by
that Starcraft 2 guy
how's it going guys we were at LAX
Airport waiting for our flight to board
but in the meantime while we're waiting
I thought I would do a quick unbagging
of my carry-on bag you can see that big
one down there is also my carry-on but
that's just my clothes nothing fun in
there other than maybe deodorant
this is the first pocket by the way like
my bag where'd this guy come from crap
this pang actually came from an awesome
site called new Wacom thanks for asking
so going into the first zipper here I've
never really unbagged
a bag before so it's kind of awkward but
I've got my hand sanitizer gel right
here we were at an airport we're gonna
be on a plane this is almost essential
this is like flight travelers 101 and
then we've also got a look at this some
tech guys Kingston Kingston little uh
HyperX flash drive right there 16 gig
unfortunately there's only USB 2.0
retractable USB and its retractable or I
didn't see we got a little keychain
thing I haven't put up a keychain that
leash on it yet but I probably should
and I've got a chapstick right here this
is an organic
hippie chapstick is hippie man you can
see I've used it quite a bit it's
definitely used theny you guys want to
buy it and so on the right now for us
also got nail clippers you know cuz you
never know will will CVS branding right
there logo on the front it also has this
really nice pop-out cuticle trimmer
right there and nail file it's just like
a three-in-one
I mean it's pretty good stuff here and
then oh yeah definitely can't forget my
single hauls cough drop in case I get a
very mild cough attack for five minutes
this this will serve that purpose just
fine so from that I think I have some
other stuff oh you know what dice you
always need some dice shoot some dice
emboss I'm gonna shoot some dice in
Boston maybe play some 7-eleven dubs who
knows they actually have a a power fort
from choice which is like a company
owned by Cooler Master they actually
have this power fort here which they
gave to me for free oh you brought yours
I brought mine this is actually cool you
can charge it right charge it with the
USB through wall or you know with the
USB connector and then you can actually
charge wirelessly your phone or whatever
us being able device so I brought it so
that my phone lasts forever for the 6
hours that were on the trip I also have
a little what's this
a felt bag what could it be could it be
dissipations killing me
it's a mini speaker speaker it's a king
evo I've actually never heard of this
brand till I got one of these but I
looked it up on a new egg of course I
think that's the same one I got for my
brother-in-law actually for your
Christmas oh yeah yeah say that's pretty
solid I'm pretty satisfied with it so
far it's got the only thing I wish is
that I wish that the connector here was
a little bit longer it's kind of a short
cable but I guess it keeps it nice and
compact and tidy but you can actually
twist this and pop it up for some boomin
base if you if you so desire yeah right
there so I think that's pretty much all
along my bag for this trip so uh thank
you guys for watching this episode of
LAX Tech special stuff and see you next
product demo on the tweets power fort
say wanna take a look here
my phone is pretty much about to die so
I'm gonna charge it with the power for
it right here it's got a USB cable USB
to micro and just plug it in like vents
turn it on this is my LED indicators
telling you how much battery strength
you got we've got quite a bit of juice
left so you can plug it in right here
like so I got that you can see I'm
liking for you
and see the battery icon right there it
is now charging my phone it's now I can
continue listening the music on the
plane for the rest of this flight and of
course I was drinking the 12-year Scotch
in true awesomesauce fashion and we have
landed touchdown
you drop everybody all right so we just
landed in Boston and we've been greeted
with a nice green tax sign that's nice
at the airport right you don't see that
every day
but there's a long six-hour flight Paul
had a great time he sat next to awesome
people I'm sure I don't know you're
gonna follow me and he watched and see I
just said a cameo that real quick and
Emily no dude I got screwed I actually
had to my channel got stuck on the Golf
Channel so I watched golf for four hours
you couldn't change it no I couldn't my
channel with messed up is relaxing
women's golf we're gonna make it big
u-turn but this is left two years why is
it okay to go out there and make a left
but not for me make it right here Boston
is stupid this building in front of us
you think we have anything like that in
California pretty stupid
there's snow everywhere it's beautiful
