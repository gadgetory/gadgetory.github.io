from California to boston massachusetts
for pax east i'm really excited I'm
super pumped I can't wait to get there
see you guys bright and early it's gonna
be awesome I'm dying I don't want to go
but we're both gonna do documentaries no
i'll meet you i'm too lazy that guy's
Paul doesn't take you guys worth it
that's not what I said at all right
before i hit recordings like I don't
think they're working well maybe I would
make a documentary if Kyle would let me
use the flip the tiles Elin with the
flip and I don't know what's a handy
your method of like just pulling a
camera out of your pocket tickets video
flip using the football driving don't
try this at home kids yeah for the he'll
be going so we left newegg about five
seconds ago and we're in Home Depot it
seems like any time we'd go on a trip we
just have to make like a pit stop to
some random store to get one last item
that we need for our trip so right now
we are looking for if you're not allowed
to record in a retail environment well
thank you for telling me that employee
of this China spoiling your documentary
because i'm not making one wow that's
just like posing the guys well we're
looking for two screwdrivers and two
flashlights and that's precisely for the
build contest this isn't what we were
looking for fall these air compressors
this is not the air compressor you're
looking for if you guys are gonna be at
the build off that we're gonna be
hosting at at PAX you're gonna need one
of these screwdrivers and it's really
gonna be dark as hell on there so we're
gonna get you guys some flashlights
aren't we nice army nice to our fans
Paul yes Hey look the screwdriver
sponsored by that starcraft 2 guy
I was gone guys we were at LAX airport
waiting for our flight to board but in
the meantime while we're waiting I
thought I would do a quick unpacking of
my carry-on bag you can see that big one
down there is also my carry-on but
that's just my clothes nothing fun in
there other than maybe deodorant which
can be fun sometimes but let's see what
I have with me here this is the first
pocket by the way like my bag we're at
this bag come from crap this pang
actually came from an awesome site
called me calm X thanks for asking so
going on to the first zipper here I've
never really unpacked a bag before so
this kind of awkward but I've got my
hand sanitizer gel right here we were at
an airport we're gonna be on a plane
this is almost essential this is like
flight travelers 101 and then we've also
got a look at this some tech guys
Kingston Kingston Lula hyperx flash
drive right there 16 gig unfortunately
it is only USB to point out retractable
he asleep and its retractable ridin even
got a little keychain thing I haven't
put a keychain a leash on it yet but I
probably should and I've got a chapstick
right here this is an organic lips
they're bears some hippie chapstick it
is hippie man you can see I've used it
quite a bit it's definitely used funny
guys want to buy it I'm selling it right
now for 299 also got nail clippers you
know cuz you never know little CBS
branding right there logo on the front
it also has this really nice pop out
cuticle trimmer right there and nail
file it's just like a three in one I
mean it's pretty good stuff here and
then oh yeah definitely can't forget my
single halls cough drop in case I get a
very mild cough attack for five minutes
this this will serve that purpose just
fine so from that I think I have some
other stuff oh you know what dice you
always need some dice so you gotta shoot
some dyson boss I'm gonna shoot some
dice in Boston maybe play some 7-eleven
dubs who knows they actually have a a
power fort from choice which is like a
company owned by Cooler Master they
actually have this power for here which
I gave to me for free oh you brought
yours I brought mine this is actually
cool you can charge it right charge it
with the USB through wall or you know
with the USB connector and then you can
actually charge wirelessly your phone or
whatever us being able device so I
brought it so that my phone lasts
forever for the six hours that were on
the trip i also have a little what's
this it's in
I felt bag what could it be could it be
dissipations killing me oh it's a mini
speaker speaker it's a keen evo I've
actually never heard of this brand till
I got one of these but I looked it up on
newegg of course I think that's the same
one i get for my brother-in-law actually
for christmas oh yeah yeah said it's
pretty solid I'm pretty satisfied with
it so far it's got the only thing I wish
is that I wish that the connector here
was a little bit longer it's kind of a
short cable but I guess it keeps it nice
and compact and tidy but you can
actually twist this and pop it up for
some booming bass if you if you so
desire yeah right there so I think
that's pretty much all in all my bag for
this trip so uh thank you guys for
watching this episode of LAX tech
special stuff and we'll see you next
time we are on the plane right now on
our way to Boston we're about halfway
through the flight I thought this be a
perfect opportunity to give you guys a
little product demo on the tweaks power
for it so I'll take a look here and see
that my phone is pretty much about to
die so i'm going to charge it with the
power for it right here it's got a USB
cable USB to micro and just plug it in
like vents
LED indicators telling you how much
battery strength you got I've got quite
a bit of juice left so I'm just going to
plug it in right here like so I got that
you can see I'm locking for you see the
battery icon right there it is now
charging my phone so now i can continue
listening to music on the plane for the
rest of this flight and of course i was
drinking the 12 years scotch actually in
true awesomesauce fashion and we have
landed touchdown
good job everybody all right so we just
landed in boston and we've been greeted
with a nice green tax sign that's nice
at the airport all right you don't see
that every day but there's a long six
hour flight Paul had a great time he sat
next to awesome people i'm sure i didn't
