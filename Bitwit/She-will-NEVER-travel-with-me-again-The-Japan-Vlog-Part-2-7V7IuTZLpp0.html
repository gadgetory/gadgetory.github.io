checked into our hotel here at the
Gorica Don this is a real Kent which is
basically a traditional Japanese Inn and
this is a really nice hotel probably the
nicest hotel Wi-Fi Saucer I have ever
been to and I wanted to give you guys a
quick room tour because our room is
incredible but I just remembered that
Lyle my twin brother who some of you
guys are already familiar with actually
stayed in this exact room when he was
visiting Japan last year and he recorded
his own room tour so instead I'm just
gonna play you his room tour and you
guys let me know what you think oh we
are here at dog or rock her down Oh
someone already break-in someone already
break it on a refund refund
I stay in dissension sanshin room don't
know what the fuck that means let's open
the dough doubled oh oh wait I take the
shoe huh we did the same thing in my
household the hallway oh look a shining
very scary okay we go over here coffee
and tea do they have my favorite drink
my favorite drink whiskey good I have
the whiskey yes because whiskey how much
of what the prime but the prayer 4000
yen for the whiskey put it back put it

oh this a toy oh oh oh shit I'm going to
attack try to attack your back house
writhing though striding down someone is
riding down striding down striding down
striving to us right now all recurring a
human centipede what is that oh it's a
pattern it's a patter to beat the
children beat the children Japanese are
so good at this a print I probably
should have previewed that room tour
before I showed it to you guys I
actually haven't watched it yet I just
dropped it in the video but hopefully
Lyle did a good job of showing you guys
around here's a quick little montage of
some shots that I got around the rest of
the hotel just to give you guys the sort
of feel for the greatness and luxury
that is the gorica Don
we're having dinner now and we just got
served our appetizer
this is like an 16 course meal or
something what's that sauce cream of
some young guy I believe that and that
is eel corn tempura and then we have
what looks to be meat that was so good
I pretty much ate everything except for
the me not a human fan and the marijuana
leaf and now we're getting to the good
stuff she may this is the best tuna I've
ever had in my life and they give you
real wasabi not that green horseradish
stuff you get in the States
grilled Wagyu beef with two zeus starch
powder garnished with eggplant pumpkin
and deep-fried sweet green pepper with
soy sauce and horseradish
all right so we're officially checked
out of Gorka Don our magical stay has
come to a bitter end but that's okay
we're actually on our way to Kyoto now
we're here at the station just waiting
for our Shinkansen also known as a
bullet train these things go pretty damn
fast up to 200 miles an hour if not
faster actually and we've seen a couple
of them fly by here at the station just
sitting here they are incredibly quick
wifey sauce is actually kind of
terrified to go on one
just the rate at which things are flying
by on ground level is insane so you have
every right to be terrified honey
all right we have arrived in beautiful
kyoto already checked into our hotel
namely get paid same thing we do every
night pinky
it's too slippery
fake news one of the things I love about
your behind is we'll take one inning and
master it to a team take this place that
we're at right now for example they
specialize in gyoza also known as
potstickers in the good ol US of A look
at all these options again oh my
goodness I'm going to order all of them
we're here at the dashiki market in
Kyoto it's about a mile away from our
hotel they've got a ton of food vendors
here up and down this really long street
and we're gonna just try some things out
and see what's good and what's terrible
thank you so much I don't know myself
all right taste test now I have had
takoyaki before in the States but it's
been a while let's see how this goes
it's really good looks like our good
friend here is having an out-of-body
experience
starch bun with a Sookie bean filling Oh
looks like two little turds that someone
sneezed on I'm sure it tastes better
than it looks I'll take a small bite mmm
chewy sweet and refreshing it doesn't
taste like snot covered turkey grilled
shrimp with salt and lemon honesty I'm
very good very good
lemon thank you so much thank you black
sesame ice cream oh yeah a very strong
black sesame flavor as you might expect
rich and creamy not too sweet though
which I really like they've been put
like little crumbles of sesame seed on
it you know they say that you eat with
your eyes first but sometimes your eyes
lie to you fortunately most of the
things that I've eaten in Japan tastes
as good as my eyes think they should
it's over
found this bar on Yelp and it looks like
the coolest bar in Japan let's go inside
we have done a lot of walking on this
trip so far I would say every day we've
walked no less than about 10 miles which
is insane that's that's far above our
average considering that we sit in front
of a computer all day at home so because
of that we're actually walking once
again to a very popular massage parlor
not the happy ending kind to get a
relaxing shiatsu massage traditional
japanese massage basically I just hope
that they're gentle with me because last
time I got a massage in Taiwan a couple
years ago it was the most excruciating
ly painful event of my life fingers
crossed and here we are
Yoshio they got a certificate of
excellence in 2017 from TripAdvisor
that's a good sign here we go it's kind
of nice we get to be next to each other
what do you think guys how do I look
pretty good
alright so we just got done with our
massage let's give a 1 through 10 score
on how much we enjoyed it at the same
time 10 being the best
1 2 3 9 but that's pretty good that's
pretty good that was probably one of the
best massages I've ever had agreed and I
think that I found that my favorite type
of story pretty heavily the reason why I
wouldn't give it and some of the
pressure points tickled okay that is the
only reason for me why it didn't get a
10 there was a one scare towards the
very very end when he brought both my
knees up to my chest so rapidly that I
completely thought I was gonna fart on
him I was like oh my god this is gonna
be the rudest ending to this amazing
experience apart from those caveats that
was a lovely massage you guys were ever
in the Kyoto area and Japan definitely
check this place out I got excited for a
minute when I thought this said Verizon
Museum of History no I don't care still
more effective than notification Bell on
YouTube we're in the arashiyama area now
currently lurking in the bamboo forest
and bamboo is not only delicious but it
grows really really fast
none of this bamboo was here yesterday
in fact other fun facts about bamboo you
can use it as a straw to drink your
drink it is every panda's favorite food
the average lifespan of bamboo ranges
anywhere from one to a million years
bamboo is traditionally used to ward off
evil spirits including ghosts that's why
it's called bamboo most people don't
know that bamboo is actually man-made
and now it's time for monkey park yeah I
usually look at mine the same way do you
know I was I miss most about Japan the
fact that all the chairs have Wi-Fi
signal patterns books and drugs the
amount of mind expansion going on in
this store must be off the charts we
just converted the last of our yen into
USD before we hop on our plane and this
is all that was left
look it's a dollar bill in like the most
pristine condition you've ever seen what
he's I'm cool
look on your face that's why and that's
it we're home just like that driving in
my own car driving on our own streets
it's been a blast Japan and Taiwan where
we're both fantastic but now that we're
home it is time to do the one thing
we've been waiting to do for the last 3
weeks now so if you'll excuse us sign
off with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
