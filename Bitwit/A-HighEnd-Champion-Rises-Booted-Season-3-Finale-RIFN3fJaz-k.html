that shaky start guys again let me know
if anything starts to look wonky or
start starts lagging out you know you
guys are pretty good with the with the
rip with the rip and Chet okay where was
I
cable Mon let's go back to cable one
cable configurator go ahead and check
out the link in the description below
and yeah it'll it'll take you right to
this configurator here you can have you
have a bunch of different power supplies
to choose from and then you essentially
can just customize any sleeved cable you
like between any of these options 24 pin
for example you know you've got your
hole around the middle here anything you
would need for for your modern-day
system you can even adjust the length of
the cable so you don't have any excess
cable clutter which is really nice I'm
gonna do a six plus two pin for our PCIe
and it's like literally just this simple
guys you just click on the color and
just boom you click on whichever cable
you want to be colored in that hue you
can just do whatever you want I mean I
like I like pink so I'm gonna do like
some pink and and some white and black
there you go and you can you can add
more cables to that however many you
want it's really great stuff and I
actually have the rainbow color the
rainbow colored cable the the nyan cat
24 pin ATX cable that I customized a
couple weeks ago finally arrived in the
mail it wasn't cable mods fault it was
some issue with DHL actually it was
probably my fault for not entering the
gate code that needed to be accessed
however I do have the cable here and I'm
gonna be showing this off during the
voting round of this episode so you guys
will be able to see it in person well
not quite in person but you'll be able
to get a better idea of the quality and
the look and feel of cable mods work
here and I'll tell you right now it's
quite good it's quite good it's good
stuff so thank you again cable mod for
sponsoring the show and also thank you
Michael and Chet for the donation really
appreciate it our my grabs your fan girl
appreciate it
what am i encoding with I am encoding
with a black magic what's it called
intensity Pro intensity Pro it's a great
card but as far as I know it only
captures a 10-8
thirty frames per second I think it does
60 actually it does 60 but for whatever
reason my gh4 only does 1080 at 24
that's the only way it's gonna be
compatible with um with black magic but
hey that's a different story
it's it's good it's good stuff thank you
for the donation all right let's let's
go ahead and just briefly recap on how
the show works for any of you new timers
in here that are just getting into this
show you know the season finale can be a
bit overwhelming for people who don't
know the format of how this show works
so basically three weeks ago for the
last three weeks we've been eliminating
a groups of five groups of five pcs and
electing you guys have been electing one
PC out of each of those groups and now
we're in week four right here to the
right and we have our three finalists
for this season of April and again we're
going to vote off two of those two of
them will be booted so to speak leaving
us one grand prize winner who is going
to win a $500 prize in their choice of
either a steam gift card or an Amazon
gift card and you know you can do pretty
much anything you want with with that
Amazon gift card if you so choose
upgrade your rig things like that buy a
bunch of cat food it's all fair fair
game
okay let's talk about the first PC our
week 1 finalist who was Alex Alex with
his s340 build rockin some older
generation of hardware but still very
good powerful hardware like 4790k gtx
980ti he's got 32 gigs of HyperX ddr3
z97 classified from EVGA motherboard
very very nice clean system probably the
cleanest system that we have that we've
seen so far on this season of booted
just look at that cable management
like like what cables besides the PCIe
you don't even really see much much else
everything's tucked away so nice and
neat he's got those beautiful cable
combs straightening that out and that
cryo rig cooler with those not to a fans
that have those white rubber pads on the
corners just look absolutely gorgeous
it's such a simple system and it's not
like a super expensive high-end system
by any means but
alex is just such a bang-up job cleaning
this thing up and just making it look so
damn clean and polished I also like the
the RAM the alternating ram the black
and white Tim's I think that's very
clever it just gives it a nice little
touch there instead of being too dark or
too too white and here's just another
angle here I think the only thing that I
could really critique Alex on here not
even that really critique but if if I
was to go move forward with making
improvements to the system or making
little changes here and there I might
think about like spray painting those
SSDs white possibly black could work too
obviously but I think you know
spray-painting them making them look
really clean just all white and maybe
putting some some black kind of decal or
some spray paint I don't know a stencil
of some sort would look pretty cool
let's get this cable management good god
good god man that freaking cable
management is absolutely stunning
by far again the best cable management
at least on the rear side the ugly nasty
side where usually you know people are
hiding all the skeletons in their closet
sort of thing this is the nicest
backside cable management I have seen in
a long time not even on booted just Pitt
my PC online on Twitter just this is so
clean man absolutely beautiful and thank
you Michael again for a donation don't
if you keep donating I'm just gonna have
to keep like pausing the show it's gonna
suck you ruin it for everyone No thank
you so much for the donation I really
appreciate it
how much storage do I have wow you have
18 terabytes that's that's a lot of 4k
porn indeed I have what do I have I have
a 400 gig 750 series SSD from Intel that
I used for my scratch disk I've got a
250 gig HyperX savage for my boot drive
I'm talking about hot line back there
and then I've got three four terabyte WD
blacks in two of them are of which are
in raid one mirrored and then one of
them I just used for like Steam games
and things like that so thank you for
the donation but look at that cable man
just back to this cable management holy
moley
then cable combs on the back easy we got
cable combs on the back side and and
it's it's especially hard to have this
much
discipline with cable management when
you're dealing in a case like the s340
that has a massive power supply shroud
just but with so much room for
activities and and cable management
especially where it's just so easy to
look at that space and just cram
everything in there and and wham bam
thank you ma'am
slap the side panel on you're done and
you don't really need to do much else
than that but alex has really gone the
extra mile here with great outstanding
use of those tie-down points look at the
SATA cables look at the state of cables
to the left of the the 24 pin just on
the left side it's just beautiful ah
you're making my software hardware let
me tell you you know what I'm saying so
very nice job Alex
very nice job I can definitely see why
you made it in here to the final round
but let's move on to George georgie-poo
will will Gaines
Matt Gaines thank you for the donation
donate for baby oil yes but I do have a
an ongoing baby oil fund with Paul we
are making sure to include all of your
tips into that pot once we reach a
disgusting amount we will buy we will go
to Costco and buy a ten gallon jug of
baby oil and we will use it for horrible
irresponsible things be very
inappropriate all right George what are
you rocking here define s horrible case
man I would I would not recommend anyone
use a define s you've got a core i7 59
30 K and two gtx 980ti is in sli both
from msi this is just another
outstanding system holy mother of
airflow again you've just got so much
air pumping through this thing it's it's
outstanding and and the fan the fan
blades are red I heard that you have
spray-painted all of them red as well as
that SLI bridge so a little bit of
custom work went in here I really like
that and your cable management is also
on point yeah that's it that's a nice
looking that's a nice looking cooler
that you got there the water 3.0 looks
really good in certain cases and not so
great in others I think it does great in
the define ass and you've also got a
beautiful set of memory in there
let's go ahead and take a look at the
money shot yeah man this is gonna be
tough this is gonna be tough I can
already see people by biting their nails
like I don't know I don't know what's
just am I like better they're both so
good they're all so good and and cheese
I really do um I can appreciate just the
level of time that went into this you
can just tell that a lot of thought was
put in you've got some white LEDs which
which look very nice it's it's fairly
even lighting it's an even coat I feel
like there could be a little bit more
illumination down at the bottom of the
case it looks like it's kind of in that
top right corner that top right quadrant
if you will but overall it does look
very even and I also really like the
implementation of the SSDs those HyperX
savages on the reservoir as I like to
call it that really aren't meant for
mounting SSDs that's that's for
reservoirs and and the hard drives go on
the opposite side of that but first time
I've seen SSDs mounted to the front of
it and I think that's a really cool idea
and obviously the SSDs match perfectly
with the the color scheme here let's
take a look at your cable management's
very nice very nice yeah this is this is
pretty good too it's it's not like quite
as pristine as Alex's but by all means
it's still really really good and and
there we get another shot of a night our
first shot of your your WD blue Drive in
there you caviar blue probably the only
thing in your system that's not red or
black
it's that WD blue drive caviar blue but
yeah excellent
you know usage again of the tie-down
points you use them a lot of velcro
straps Michael you are now bankrupt
because of your third third donation 950
pro 512 gig yes I have I have that that
same Drive and it's it's it's
outstanding but yeah man George your
 is on point sir your is on
point if I have to give one critique one
small tiny critique it would be that
it'd be kind of cool to see a little bit
more red in your RAM
granted you know the all black matches
perfectly but I just feel like if there
was just a smidge of red in there or if
you got some black and red dims it would
bring a little bit more red more color
to that central part of your system
around your CPU but that's again that's
such a small quibble that yeah you can't
really say too much else about this
system other than its fan tastic see
what I did there let's move on to our
last and final finalist from week three
this was last week's finalist that you
guys voted on and this is Gaza's system
apart from having the coolest name that
i've ever heard
gas also has an s3 40 just like Alex but
you can see it's the black and black and
red version sv40 come in black and red
or did he spray paint or color that that
side area I think I think there's a
black and red or maybe it's custom work
I I don't really know but you do have a
very nice end stub and badge there
repping the Mass Effect franchise on the
front of your case which I very much
like gives it some character and really
makes it unique and you've also got some
older generation of hardware as far as a
CPU go some 4790k no slouch however and
the GTX 980 Strix beautiful beautiful
cable sleeping here I'm not sure if it
is custom or if you you got it somewhere
you bought it off the shelf either way
it looks great your cable combing and
the training here is really on point and
I just got to say again I really really
like those tubing separators that you
have on your your crack in there on your
AI oh it just they look frickin
amazeballs amazeballs damn guys damn
okay so someone's saying it's orange the
case is red oh you guys are saying the
case is actually red ok does come in
black and red ok thank you for pointing
that out y'all so uh again nice nice
choice of case there you've also got a
pretty beefy SSD arrangement it looks
like let's uh let's go ahead and
okay you've got a couple more optional
photos here now the one thing that one
critique I had for for gas as awesome as
a system was was that m2 SSD having that
you know kind of a hideous looking green
PCB and again it wouldn't be so bad if
it was mounted underneath the video card
however when it's above the video card
in between your GPU and your CPU it is
very noticeable it's right front and
center and man not much you can do about
that other than swap it out in the
future but everything else is pretty
awesome
thank you Michael now you're selling
your house for all these donations if
you have to sell your house after but
for dollars I I'm surprised you had a
house to begin with sir but I do
appreciate all the donations yes I did
not do anything with my hair other than
cut it it's amazing what a haircut can
do especially when you have a mop on
your head like I do alright let's take a
look at Gaza's cable management and okay
it's it's not horrible by any means it's
it's not bad but I wouldn't call it
stellar at the same time this is kind of
what I was referring to when I was
talking about Alex's cable management
how when you have that power supply
shroud area for stashing cables and
stuff it's easy to just cram it all in
there it looks like you did that to some
degree here but you also did take very
good use of the the tie-down points and
and it's not atrocious I wouldn't say
it's atrocious but definitely not the
cleanest cleanest we've seen today on
today's episode so far however I'm not
gonna dock you any points I haven't
really been doing the points thing too
often on the show I should start doing
that more even though they don't matter
whatever I do a lot of things that don't
matter never stopped me before
Conrad thank you for the booty thank you
for that booty donation touch my booty
any time out you can touch my booty for
a dollar hell you just have to ask you
know I I'm pretty easy easygoing it's
not what I meant
I didn't mean I'm easy I mean I'm
easygoing it's a difference I'm not sure
not a Whore not a Whore yeah I kind of
kind of a whore okay
so gas gas let's take a look at them
money shot I just this is what I used I
used this shot or no it was this shot
for the thumbnail in last week's episode
it's just so pretty and it's a great
motherboard too it's got that red LED
audio trace layout by the sound chip the
built-in sound chip which is really
really popping it's doing it for me is
the pop filter working when I say pop it
better be
and yeah you've got that nice glowing
Kraken oh yes nice red Vengeance Ram oh
it's so good everything so good all
these systems how do you decide I I feel
like I have the easy job as a host
because I just get to blab about what I
see you guys have the difficult decision
of choosing between these three
beautiful systems thank you so much
sword dust came late but still around
hey I hear you get around sword dust
thank you very much for the donation sir
you are a bro okay
so right about now you should be seeing
a link go out and chat from my beautiful
wife Heather who's in the other room
she's gonna paste the link in chat tell
you guys to vote on one of these three
systems and this is for this is for all
the marbles guys this is going to
determine who will win our $500 grand
prize for the whole season so think very
carefully and while you think carefully
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at
our sponsor one more time but instead of
going to a website we're gonna look at
the actual cable that I ordered from
cable mod link in the description below
if you want to check out their new cable
configurator it is absolutely fantastic
you guys ready and then it's in a
plastic bag it it comes packaged you
know in this thing but it also comes in
like a parcel envelope they don't just
like some like newspaper boy who's like
riding a bicycle down your neighborhood
just checks it out like a newspaper and
it lands on your porch or you know
breaks of breaks a freaking plant vase
or something
okay look at this look at this
oh my gosh it's so beautiful obviously
you know you'd have to train it you got
to train that you can't just whip
it out and expect it to perform as
expected if you know what I mean
so but damn the quality on this is
really good this is like the paracord
types leaving it's kind of like the
fabric II kind it's a I see no fraying
whatsoever so you want it to like you
know bust up the nail clippers or
anything it's very clean the cables are
very rich and vibrant as well and and
they have a nice a decent flex to them
also no heat shrink obviously not too
many people are a fan of that these days
so it's completely omitted here which is
awesome here's the other end of its
you've got your your split connectors
there and this is so nice and I don't
know if you guys caught my post on
Instagram or Twitter or both where I
posted a picture of this was definitely
Instagram but how cool would it be to do
a neon cat theme system I think that'd
be cool
and you know what you know a dead mouse
the popular DJ guy who does all the EDM
 he bought a neon cat Lambo or he
had a neon cat Lambo customized like a
couple of years back he's a big fan of
nyan cat apparently but it would be cool
if I could like build him a nyan cat PC
because he's also into pcs from what I
hear he's always posting pictures of
like his gaming laptop or like NVIDIA
Quadro cards that he uses for like audio
editing I should definitely hit him up
and ask him dude can I build you a nyan
cat PC if you think that's a cool idea
then maybe I'll I'll hit him up on
Twitter and see if you know there's a
there's probably a 2% chance that he
gets back to me but um I think that
would be freakin awesome start doing
some more VIP builds up in her but yeah
let me just go ahead and swig this oh oh
that vodka I hope you guys don't think
this is really bad guy I said this is
water right okay
would be very very irresponsible with me
drinking out of a cup kind of kind of
alcoholic of me okay so I think that's
enough time for you guys
to have voted on who you will like the
bus so let's go ahead and move over to
the can you see em can you tell I'm
stalling
can you tell is that is obvious here we
go
here are three contenders oh my goodness
so we have Alex number one Jorge number
two and Gaz number three this is gonna
be intense guys I don't know um if I
were to have chosen a winner I think I
think my favorite is Alex I don't know
there's just something that that is very
different about it but it's familiar but
let's see what you guys thought because
they were all really good here we go
ready look at the results back refresh
Wow
oh my goodness Alex with the win by a
landslide
holy moly 69% I see what you guys did
there I see what you guys did there
George took second and Gaz unfortunately
took third George and gasps you guys did
a great job your systems are beautiful
there's a lot of envy around your
systems I'm sure in chat but
unfortunately you have been booted and
that leaves us to Alex Alex
congratulations man you're our grand
prize winner for season three you are
the first grand prize winner for the
Hyatt for any high-end season two booted
granted yeah this is this is the only
one so far but it's you man you're the
man man so dude awesome job and make
sure to thank everyone in chat or in the
comments for voting for your system and
I'll be reaching out to you very soon
and let you let you know how the whole
price things thing works but man man I I
had a feeling it was gonna be Alex y'all
I really did however I didn't think he
was gonna win by such a landslide that
is pretty epic he Alex you should feel
very good about yourself right now bro
bad
good so um yeah guys wow I meant that
and just like that boom season three
booted was over like damn it just just
came and went and season four which is
next month actually next week is the the
premiere is also going to be a high-end
season it's gonna be another $1,500 more
or less system competition and we have a
lot more I have a lot more contestants
to roll through submission period is
closed it closed like a week or two ago
so don't don't send me anything there
will be other opportunities for high-end
seasons of booted however it's gonna be
really exciting stuff this was a great I
think probably the most energetic season
to boot is so far I think because it is
high-end and you know it's nice it's
it's fun to see nice systems you know a
budget system there's something sacred
about a budget rig or even an entry
level you know mid mid range build but
when you have a bit more funding to play
around with you really get some more
unique and diverse types of builds and I
think that's what made this season so
fun and that's why I'm looking forward
to season four next Monday so guys if
you want to catch it live and you're
watching this you know like why do I
keep missing it it's because you don't
know it when it starts so here's when it
starts it starts on Mondays this is what
airs airs on Mondays at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific on my You Tube channel you can
follow me on twitter at forever Kyle
where I'll be posting direct links to
the videos as we you know on Mondays
when we get closer to to Showtime things
like that and I believe April let's see
may may has one two three four five
Mondays in it so on the fifth the fifth
Monday of May there will be no show got
it good good
get that through your thick skull I know
I'm being so mean to you you guys are
awesome by the way this is I think this
is the first video I've ever worn my own
BIOS flasher shirt that I spilt water on
his eye it doesn't come that way dammit
it doesn't the shirt doesn't come with a
black eye like the BIOS chip does
come with a black guy guys that's
literally I just spilt water on my shirt
that's not a misprint I can vouch for
the quality this looks really bad right
now I'm so sorry but anyway if you guys
are interested in picking up a shirt
like this you can go ahead and head over
to awesomesauce network.com slash store
where there are things for you to buy
and enjoy oh yeah like the bio splasher
shirt right hurr uh-huh and if you guys
can't see it cuz it's far away
it does say BIOS on the chip itself it
says BIOS right there so you know you
won't mistake it for some other kind of
chip that's the kind of really drives
the the joke own if you don't know
what's a BIOS chip then you're like why
why is there so many why are all these
parts in peril like this poor CPU here
who knows he probably deserved it though
also the state positive shirt is like
not in stock at all there's probably
like one or two more shirts and I don't
even know what sizes they're in but I'll
be restocking this stuff soon kind of
got drilled recently from taxes but once
that all settles rest assured I will
have more in inventory so thank you guys
for putting up with me and my blabbin
but I'm gonna close out the show now so
you guys have a good evening or morning
or whatever it is if you're watching
this on youtube be sure to like it
because you can do that or if you're
watching life like the video also let me
know what you want to see in future
episodes this is still a very young
series so if you have any ideas for
improvements or suggestions
I know Spyder fan who's a recent mod mod
and Chad suggested maybe bringing on and
why are we listening to the dramatic
voting music again sigh stop a Spyder
fans suggested maybe bringing on a
special guest for every season finale of
booted and I thought that was a really
cool idea so I'm gonna think that over
as well as some other things and and
we'll go from there I want to I don't
want to change too much at once that can
get kind of messy so we'll just make
these slight changes over time and
eventually work out something that feels
really really nice and polished for
y'all all right sound good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
