enough pins for that socket this is
great I'm really glad you asked me out
well it's not every day that you meet a
pretty girl who's also into technology
now who would have thought that you
would pick up girls at micro Center
especially ones with such good taste in
hardware not that I've forgiven you yet
for snagging the last gtx 1070 in the
whole store I was so looking forward to
playing pub G and having it not look
like a flipbook on my rig and I'm so
looking forward to mining some Bitcoin
when I get home I'm sorry did you say
mining yeah what did you think I was
gonna do with all those cards
no wonder you bought 20 of them that was
weird
is there an issue yes of course there's
an issue
okay micro sunder won't have another
batch of GPUs for weeks and they'll have
tripled in price by then I oh my god I'm
gonna have to game on integrated
graphics for the rest of my life huh how
could you do this to me it wasn't
personal okay I'm saving money for Law
School and waiting tables only go so far
fighting for justice isn't cheap
you speak of justice what about the
gamers
how are Little John and little Timmy
supposed to afford to build their next
gaming PC when you and your people are
snatching up all the GPU supply and
inflating the prices a little John is a
rapper see my game
sorry to interrupt would you care for
more why is it coil wine cuz if it is
she's already got plenty of that at home
yes I do he might want some more though
because all he does is wine
I'm fine with water
okay fucking white people
look I understand why you're upset
I really do and the crypto bubble may
pop any day now but even when it does
there's still a chance that mining is
here to stay and to be honest I don't
think it's fair for one group of people
to call dibs on a product that's sold in
an open market you're right you're right
I'm sorry that I've been projecting my
feelings towards the situation onto you
it just it just sucks I know hey
I know it's not a new GPU but let me
make it up to you by getting dinner no
no no no don't fight me on this okay
besides I probably make more money than
usual on that night all right don't push
it all right I have to use the ladies
room
so if the waiter comes by it's the red
card don't look at my photo ID or I'll
kill you
2002
she's a minor minor Oh
hey know what I found
did you know they accept Bitcoin here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
