channel this is the first video I'll be
filming since my return from Asia oh
isn't Computex or in Taipei for Computex
for about seven days and I was
travelling around Japan for ten days
after that with the wife I'm finally
back so this is the first thing I'll be
shooting since my return and I am
severely jet-lagged at the moment so
forgive me if I pass out midway through
this video and do not wake up but this
is gonna be a fun little Q&amp;amp;A just super
casual I just asked you guys to ask me
some stimulating questions here on
Twitter and let's see what you guys came
up with the mass droppin Sen hyzer HD 5
8 x jubilee headphones are finally here
enjoy crystal-clear dynamic sound with a
hundred and fifty ohm drivers while
treating your ears to softball or
padding for endless comfort catch the
drop on this one-of-a-kind item before
it's too late you can learn more in the
link below how much time do you spend
making videos scripting recording
editing and do you have something that
you're really good at like sports
cooking or dancing that's two questions
technically but I'll let it pass
the first part of that is really just
depends on what kind of video I'm doing
that determines how long it's going to
take to make from start to finish for
example this is a really quick video
that we're doing right here it'll
probably take anywhere between five and
ten hours from start to finish but if
it's something like an in-depth review
or even an episode of stack attack it
can take anywhere from 15 to 20 hours
when there's heavy benchmarking or
analysis involved or a multicam setup
that is just gonna tank us in
post-production so it really just
depends on a case-by-case basis do I
have something that I'm really good at
besides making the occasional decent
YouTube video there is one hidden talent
that you guys probably don't know about
me let me show it to you on a scale of 1
to Jesus how attractive is gamers Nexus
I'm assuming you're talking about Steve
from gamers Nexus on a scale of 1 to
Jesus I would put him at come on
obviously it's a 1
one being the most attractive how much
RGB is too much RGB honestly you can
have as much RGB on your system on your
case as you want I really don't care
when I have a personal issue with RGB
and just aesthetics in general is when
users are spending more on the look of
their system than performance if you
don't care that you're running your game
15 percent slower than you could be
because you really just wanted it to
look nice then that's fine that's your
personal choice but if you're trying to
maximize the price to performance of
your system yet you're spending thirty
to fifty plus dollars on lighting then
that's where I would draw the RGB line
in the sand
most anticipating game announced at e3 I
was actually in Asia when III was going
on so I caught bits and pieces of it but
the two titles that caught my eye
one was cyberpunk 2077 I think just the
trailer was phenomenal and the artwork
and style and design of that game just
just speaks to me for whatever reason so
I can't wait to try that out and you
know potentially bencher work and that
sort of thing but it wasn't a gameplay
trailer was just sort of a storyline
trailer as far as the most exciting
gameplay that I got the most hyped for I
would say The Last of Us part 2 really
made an impact it just looks so fun the
combat style looks great I feel really
conflicted about it of course because
it's a ps4 exclusive and I don't own a
ps4 so it's one of those things where
it's like is this game gonna be so great
where it's worth buying an entire
platform for and investing into that
ecosystem I don't know you guys let me
know your thoughts on that how many
sticks of RAM do you currently have in
your possession oh I I have enough RAM
in my possession right now that if I
sold it all
that I could buy an island with an
island in the middle of it and up island
deception so I have two I have two
sticks of RAM I just got an asus strix
gtx 1080p i running it with an ASUS
Maximus hero 9 and a 6600 K overclock to
4.6 gigahertz how much of a bottleneck
is my CPU on the GPU I would assume not
a lot if there is some it's probably
very little and it probably wouldn't be
worth going you know upgrading your
entire platform to say an 8700 K with a
new motherboard just for a few
percentage points unless you're doing
something that's really gonna utilize
those additional cores and threads that
you'll be getting
over your quad-core 6600 K such as
streaming or rendering if you're
throwing either of those tasks into the
mix then perhaps you might want to
consider upgrading to a higher core and
thread count chip but for now I think
your your systems gonna do just fine for
the next few years
besides bragging rights in higher FPS
what does overclocking actually do for
you it can do a number of things besides
just improving the performance that you
see in games for example anything that's
really taking advantage of your CPU or
your GPU that's dependent on clock speed
will see some sort of a performance
boost for example editing you might be
able to shave down seconds maybe even
minutes off of particular end codes if
you are overclocking your CPU and GPU
depending on which of those components
you're actually utilizing when encoding
certain day-to-day tasks like web
browsing for example you might not see
much of a difference when you're
overclocking versus not because it
really requires very little processing
power to run tasks like that in the
first place so you're not really gonna
be able to notice your overclock at work
in those particular scenarios but for
things like editing and more heavy duty
3d rendering applications for example
overclocking can actually give you some
real-world benefits that are a bit more
tangible what would be your perfect
burrito hmm probably one with a million
dollars inside of it because I have
expensive tastes
how do you feel now tasting actual
Japanese food like sushi and ramen and
having to go back to what the US has to
offer also what was your favorite part
well the sushi that I had in Japan was
really really good but it's nothing that
I couldn't get back home at the same
time because the sushi game here in LA
is so fierce and the competition is just
wild that good sushi is never too hard
to come by but more obscure Japanese
dishes or items like ramen while you can
find certainly really good ramen places
here on the west coast I felt like they
were on every single block in Japan just
each ball more tantalizingly delicious
than the last and some of the best ramen
I've ever had in my life as far as my
favorite part of Japan there's so much
to choose from one thing that sticks out
though was the one day
or one night that wifey sauce and I got
to stay at a traditional ryokan or a
traditional Japanese Inn where we had
like a hot springs tub in our actual
room it was kind of like in a private
backyard attached to our room it was
magical in every way the staff and
service was just excellent to to a tee
and it was unlike anything I've really
ever done before where would you like to
see your channel in five years still
standing would be a great start and it's
really hard for me to project exactly
what I want the channel to look like
five years from now because YouTube and
the tech industry everything's changing
so rapidly it's hard to really create a
roadmap there but I don't really think
it matters exactly what my youtube
channel looks like five years from now
as long as I'm continuing to create
content that I truly value and believe
in videos that I enjoy making and not
creating content just for views or based
on pressures coming from the audience or
from other content creators just just
doing stuff because I want to and if I
can make a living continuing to do that
what I have in for the last four years
full-time that'll be more than enough
for me what's the scariest thing you
feel when it comes to your channel I
guess the biggest concern that keeps me
up at night the most would be watching
having to watch the channel die off
whether it gets killed overnight by
YouTube for whatever stupid reason or
the algorithm messes with the channel
until it's completely irrelevant or it's
something that's on me where I no longer
can create decent videos or I lose an
interest for what I do and I just have
to watch this thing that I've built up
for so long and put so much time in love
and to just disintegrate in my hands
that would be that still is a terrifying
thought to this day at the same time
it's the same thought and fear that gets
me motivated that keeps me motivated to
get off my ass and create the best
possible videos I can to ensure that
doesn't happen so it's definitely a real
fear that can haunt me from time to time
but I also think it's a necessary one if
you could create design and manufacture
one piece of hardware what would it be
and why probably a mini ITX case I enjoy
the form factor I love building small
form-factor systems and I think one of
the main reasons for that is I like the
challenge of cramming as much
functionality into the smallest amount
of mass possible
and being able to manufacture an
engineer a product from the ground up
that would do that sounds like a fun and
exciting prospect to me I don't know
what I would call it I'd have to be
clever enough to compete with the dann
case so maybe like the Kyle case have
you thought about moving out of
California to avoid the excessive
business fees and taxes like Jays to
census considering no I have never
considered that the thoughts crossed my
mind but I've never seriously considered
moving out of California whyphy sauce
and I enjoy living in California it's
expensive as hell to live here it's even
more expensive to own an S corp which we
do in the state of California but at the
same time we like where we live you get
what you pay for I guess in terms of the
convenience that's you know the area of
California we live in offers and our
families here both wifey sauces and my
family are within a one or two hour
radius of our house right now and we
honestly wouldn't have it any other way
how lame is Linus in real life god he is
even lamer in person
if you could even imagine that I mean
once you see the socks and sandals that
arms-length it changes you because it's
deeply disturbing and that is why I no
longer talked to Linus in person I only
ever DN him even when he's two feet away
from me so that's all I got thank you
guys so much for submitting those
questions this was a lot of fun and now
that I'm back from Computex I just have
this one little jet lag hump to get over
and once the dust settles after that I
will be back into the swing of things
creating more videos for the channel
that I'm very excited to share with you
guys so get subscribed so you don't miss
any of that and toss a like on this
video if you enjoyed it there will be
more coming very soon you can also check
me out on floatplane if you want to
watch my videos a week early without ads
for 3 bucks a month I'll put a link for
that in the video description until next
time guys thank you so much for tuning
in have yourselves a good one and I'll
see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
