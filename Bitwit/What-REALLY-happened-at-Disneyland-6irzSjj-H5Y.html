love their children take them instead of
Disney Land
SpaceX galaxies we are coming for you
wait that's California Adventure we
can't do that yeah what what what
there's a dude look I know we're go to
Disneyland everything but I think
ecstasy is just a little much for today
99 vitamins whatever you want to call
ginger garlic that's a b12 b12 I've had
that one before that one's pretty
intense right let's let's let's make a
deal today you're going to have the
ultimate Disneyland experience where we
say yes to everything regardless of how
asinine or absurd it might be or
expensive we are gonna have the ude
Disneyland experience today starting
with VIP parking we're doing it closer
to the elevator it so closes the
apartment Oh do it do it okay thank you
did you hear that honey we're going all
the way to the front for buggy just run
this family over
we have preferred parking yeah it's fine
we have preferred parking just hit them
and then park on their dead bodies cuz
that's what we prefer alright we're good
now remember honey we have to cherish
every single one of these steps to the
escalator every one of these steps cost
a dollar fifty oh my god slow it down
take your time Jesus enjoy it a little
bit get two adult tickets for Disneyland
please is your name really shady you
know if a Minnie Mouse will be there
time you wouldn't have to know if she's
still with Mickey or asking for a friend
why is the Disneyland app sixty nine
megabytes they have Wi-Fi here then in
Disneyland for five minutes and I'm
already exhausted let's get some food
so I got the jambalaya why he's a Scot
vegan vegan jumbo I was it was it
cheaper than mine good should be well I
should be going first we're in the line
right now for Pirates of the Caribbean
since Disneyland doesn't let you take
any flash photography or video on their
rides after every ride we go on you and
I sum up the experience in one word
sound good
there we go alright you can sum up the
ride in one word loaded a few words I'll
let it slide this time
the town we're chasing the virus
encircles okay times up by a c-3po he's
mine he's mine
all right I don't think we're quite
festive enough we need an amp of our
ultimate Disney experience give this a
shot
okay very very sophisticated all right
what else we got you look like you're in
a punk rock band from the 80s hold on my
turn do it like one with the force yeah
you do I think you pull off more than I
do
see I kind of like this one because then
I can just go all around the park and no
one will think I'm weird are we going
with this I think this is good we forgot
to give a one-word response to star
tours so what's your word my one word
would be desperately needs a high
refresh rate display oh my god what the
duck what the what the ducks going on
here mother duckers holy they're
everywhere Oh duck no don't talk to my
wife I will duck you up that's cute
he's trying to duck you let's get the
duck out of here I don't think we can
cut through there we basically have to
wrap around this whole area to get to
the next drive Disneyland is not a
sandbox theme park next up is Big
Thunder Mountain Railroad here's our
train
oh wow we actually got stopped our
saviours they're here yeah not all
heroes wear capes they're gonna get us
out of here in no time
unless they're cannibals did we get like
free annual passes from this from like
just just the trauma we sustained you're
next kind of you got a little whiplash
right from from that abrupt break all
right cool train no we already tried to
do a train five seconds ago that didn't
work are we gonna be on the news so
we're gonna walk back around to our exit
and they'll help you out there okay it's
gonna be good for one exception if
you're choosing in Disneyland today so
you can save it for us you could use it
somewhere else the only place that won't
take it is Pete okay
I really hope we keep in contact with
all those people that we just shared
that that traumatic experience but
though they'll probably call us they'll
probably hit us up on Facebook or
something oh you're gonna die they stand
up for so long I know I'm parched I need
more food I feel like I'm gonna die
I forgot how creepy the line to Indiana
Jones is although I'm digging the
ambient temp sorry one word to describe
the Thunder Mountain Railroad short it
sounds like some of the last Batman
games from AC the Jones here we go okay
one word to describe Indiana Jones two
words her head actually fell off during
the ride we thought we had lost it for
good turned out it was just right behind
us because we were in the very back row
so I'm actually just landed on the
tumultuous if these dull with the time
it's pretty delicious never a dull
moment with this stuff first us go up
there and ask them if they can fill your
hole
what do you mean no get your mind
disgusting
what what are you pointing to submarine
voyage all the rides boring at least the
line will be short cuz this ride sucks
you wanted to go on this ride are you
decision it was like the baby diaper
simulator
smelling boring matterhorn better one
time all these words I just don't say
and nothing else matters Hans but in the
end it doesn't even matter
yeah I'm Samantha one yeah so far my
word is gonna be good
so now we're headed back to Blue Bayou
to see if we can get a walk in spot at
one of their dinner tables
this is the open experience Fancy Pants
restaurant I'm ready I'm ready are you
ready I'm ready
we might be a little overdressed though
I want to embarrass anyone here fancy
this bookie is ready for diving for
starters we have a salad dude no regrets

from major food coming now and white
bean sauce is cold gel so I think it's
time to call it a day and head home
