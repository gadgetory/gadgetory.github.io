to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info all
right yeah so I made a pit stop at msi
booth at CES 2018 and I found a pretty
sexy monitor that I think you guys are
gonna like it's the msi optics MP g27 CQ
27 inches 2560 by 1440 VA curved panel
with free sync support a 144 Hertz
refresh rate and a 1 millisecond
response time so this is a blazing fast
monitor and it looks fantastic and it's
curved it's it's very moderate it's got
it's got all the bells and whistles that
you might expect from a panel here in
2018 2 HDMI 2.0 ports and 1 DisplayPort
1.2 it has an aggressive stand with the
triangular base featuring tilt swivel
and height adjustment so a lot of
flexibility there with a 100 by 100 base
mount if you wanted to wall mount this
guy now there is a little joystick
behind the monitor for navigating
through the OSD which works perfectly
fine however MSI has also developed an
app which allows you to control all the
same settings straight from your
operating systems so it's really
convenient if you want to adjust things
like brightness or contrast on the fly
or even that enabling or disabling free
sync for example you can do that all now
straight from their new app which is
pretty handy now perhaps the biggest
standout feature of this display besides
the panel itself is the collaboration
that MSI has done with SteelSeries to
implement those 5 LED lighting zones or
lighting strips that you see just below
the panel each of those strips have
eight individually addressable LEDs
which you can configure with an MSI
mystic light of course or the
SteelSeries engine app and from there
things get pretty interesting because
you're no longer talking about just
aesthetics but you can actually build in
some functionality with how these LEDs
operate as well for example they gave us
say a demo within csgo where they
actually configure the different
lighting zones to reflect different
Diagnostics in-game for example I think
the first two LED strips represented
your health and you'd start to see that
diminish as you got shot another one was
ammo so every time you take a shot
obviously the LEDs would go down there
and then they had another lighting zone
that was just dedicated to the to
reflect the number of headshots that you
got in-game so really cool just at a
glance very easy to see your sort of
specs or your stats I should say in
different Diagnostics that way I mean
the fact that it's just right next to
the monitor pretty much right up to this
where you're looking anyway makes it
super visible and easy to see whereas a
lot of these same features that we've
seen implemented on keyboards and mice
and in your system itself are not really
that visible which makes them kind of
pointless the mr. or MSRP on this bad
boy is four hundred and fifty US dollars
if I remember correctly which i think is
a pretty fair price all things
considered for what you're getting with
this display it's really nice to have
freesync in there as well
but let me know what you guys think in
the comments below is this a panel that
you might be interested in what do you
think of those LED strips are those
lighting zones at the bottom of the
display as always very curious to hear
what you guys have to say apart from
that go ahead and toss me a like on the
video if you enjoyed it and feel free to
get subscribed if you're not already so
you don't miss the rest of my coverage
here at CES 2018 I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
