over there do you want to go in um honey
you never go to verdict you're sweet at
the start of context why because once
you go in there you don't come out my
coverage of Computex 2017 is brought to
you by be quiet cable Maude Berta gear
and EVGA go ahead and check out the
links below for more info all right
I'm hopping into the cockpit guys so um
wish me luck
I'm also not a really great driver as my
close friends will tell you so hopefully
this simulator is forgiving but I really
like how you just sort of get into this
cockpit here it's very easy and simple
to use you don't need any assistance the
pedals are very close to the driver
which is exactly my size and everything
feels super comfortable at this point
you've got like a little shifter right
here steering wheel looks good it's very
firm doesn't seem like it's wobbly
whatsoever the pedals also seem there's
a little bit of wiggle but it's honestly
not too bad that the metal plate can
actually go forward or backwards and it
can also adjust in terms of tilting so
depending on your to your height not to
mention the chair can go back quite a
bit and you can lock that in if you want
if you don't want it to rock offers just
a ton of flexibility here while
maintaining very comfortable sort of
sitting the experience but let's go
ahead and play some games probably not
goes oh god I should make a disclaimer
that I've never really actually played a
VR racing simulator let alone actual
racing simulators I have very limited
experience with them so this is more of
just how this is going to feel in terms
of the accessories and this is automatic
so I don't know why I'm grabbing the
shifter it's just natural response but
again everything seems really
comfortable it's quite quite immersive
it's actually sort of hard to talk and
narrate while I'm focusing on the road
which I think it's sort of what you want
in a simulator is not to crash into the
wall alright is there what
I should how do I reverse the other cool
thing about this whole setup the verdict
years implemented is that the the
steering wheel at this point this sort
of man it's like a hot shoe plate it's
like a hot plate that you can actually
just remove and swap out with another
one so instead of having to drill it so
you have multiple steering wheels that
you work with for various simulators you
have to keep removing the individual
steering wheel and drill in a new one
for example you can just sort of swap
out the hot plate and already have your
next steering wheel good to go it
literally takes like five seconds to
swap out a steering wheel with this
which is very convenient the other great
thing about this system is that you
don't actually have to buy a completely
new chair to use it you can actually buy
all these additional add-on accessories
for VR for your next stimulator and
still maintain still keep your same
verdict your chair actually these parts
are all compatible with pretty much the
whole line of verdict your racing chairs
it's really nice instead of having to
replace your entire setup and find out
what to do with your old chair you can
just buy these parts modularly
about the work and just add them on to
your liking which is just very cost
effective and space efficient as well
I like the flight simulator we did
earlier everything here feels really
sturdy has a really solid feel and
weight to it speaking of weight this is
the actual steel construction this is
one option that vertically is going to
be offering they're also going to be
offering a carbon fiber which is a bit
lighter weight so it's going to cost a
little bit more since it is a fire
material oh and there's another wall all
right I've gotten really low to the
ground to show you guys this but it's
super important so let's know this is
the blocking gas lift this little metal
bar here I actually engage it it sort of
locks the entire chair so that it
doesn't swivel left or right which is
actually way more important than you
might think especially when you've got
pedals in front and you're actually
rocking to be our headset not only does
that just keep you oriented in the
correct direction keep you facing the
right way it also prevents any sort of
like tracking loss with your with your
HMD so this is really an actual
innovative sort of design that is going
to keep you on track and keep you on
task with your gaming experience overall
so this is a again part of the racing
simulator here you can see the metal bar
that's kind of attached to the the the
shaft here of the chair and it goes all
the way to the pad
so this is really nice instead of having
the pedals on the floor first of all if
you're short like me you can't really
reach the floor and secondly even if you
are tall enough to reach the pedals you
can still potentially push the pedals
back and they might actually slide as
you're using them but that sort of
corrects that issue with this metal
bracket here this brace don't pretend
like you're driving and then you're not
driving look at that you're you're a
hack you're a fraud an absolute fraud
what do you have to say for yourself
fake news fake news right there I
believe these accessories that sort of
setup will be available to you guys
sometime in q4 of 2017 the other cool
thing about the cool setup here is when
you're done with your simulation needs
you can just go ahead and pop that
little button and the whole this is the
hot plate that I was talking about
earlier comes on very easily and there's
also a vanity plate that you can go
ahead and swap in just type just go like
this now you have yourself a little desk
while you watch TV on the big screen or
whatever it is this is actually fairly
large I mean it's relatively compact big
enough for a keyboard or Mouse certainly
or you know a tasty beverage if you
would like that but overall this is a
really sweet little package that you
guys should definitely check out when it
comes in the stores this is the light
weight you're springing my food the heck
is it than 30 get out of here watch your
dirty banana ah there's a lot more
banana than I bargained for
you know what watch that banana down
really good as a nice cold beer right
now
gotta love this place go over to here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
