episode 3 season 1 how's it going
everyone thank you all for joining me
and chat so glad to have you all on
board let me know about off the bat if
my audio and video is in sync whether or
not I'm SuperDuper choppy like I was
last week at the very beginning of the
show I fixed the whole quick sync issue
so hopefully that's not a problem
anymore but go ahead let me let me know
in chat how everything's coming out on
your end but super glad that you're all
here this is going to be really exciting
this is a very important episode because
we're going to be taking a look at our
final 5pc contestants for season 1 that
means only one lucky finalists has a
chance to really prove themselves and
make it to Round four next week where
they'll be going head-to-head with our
other two finalists from the two weeks
prior for the grand prize of 500 dulles
500 dos yeah yes a lot of money choppy
if it's a little bit choppy that's just
that's just YouTube quite frankly I've
pretty much optimized it in every way
that I can at this point i would need to
really dig a bit a bit deeper if i
wanted to really correct it as long as
it's like bearable then i'm okay with
that and i'll be continuing to look up
ways to improve the streaming quality
but hopefully the sink
you can't hear a thing
well they're saying that it's pretty
synced all right wifey sauce is saying
that it's not synced on her end you're
not hearing any sound is is the video
player audio on like if you look at the
volume bar in the YouTube video player
is that is that pumped up peeking I'm
too loud okay I'm gonna crank me down
yeah alright so I turned myself down a
little bit cuz i can get a little
enthusiastic everything's good cool
wifey sauce is the best and i do love
you Matt I do love you I love you long
time also mike managed eek i have modded
you sir i don't know if you realize that
but i modded you wifey sauce is also a
mod so you guys you know if anyone's
feeding the trolls or if they are trolls
go ahead and do your worst do your worst
i give you the power on on booted the
booted God's commend you so good I'm
glad that everything's going better or
at least more smoothly in the beginning
as than it was last week so that's
that's a good sign but like I was saying
this is a very important round it's the
last round of this season and we're
going to take a look at our final five
pcs let's go ahead and recap really
quick from the the two weeks prior where
we had our week one finalist Luke on the
left and our week two finalists Mitchell
from last week on the right now do you
guys know notice any striking
similarities or anything peculiar about
both of these systems yeah holy
guys to h4 40s white additions both with
NZXT aio coolers white cable sleeving I
think it's safe to say like Illuminati
confirmed at this point because hot damn
and you know I have to give it to NZXT
they do make a really amazing case the
h4 40 is is is like someone in chats i
think it was Jim it's like the Corvette
of cases it really has anyone who can
afford one buys one because it just
looks really good they've designed it
very well like with the PS the power
supply shroud and that hard drive cage
wala it literally covers up all the
ugliest parts of a system and that's why
it's so popular and I think that's also
why it's been doing so well on this show
but I am happy
to report that there will not be any
white edition age 4 40's on this episode
so hopefully we'll get a little bit of
diversity in there because the show's
starting to feel a little bit racist
quite frankly if I'm speaking honestly
and that's that's really all your guys
is false because I hope vote on these
things you do um and if you guys see
something and you want to call it like
no this this PC should not win clearly
just because it looks good or because of
this feel free to blow up chat and and
state your reasoning to the audience
because this is a really interactive and
engagement contest and I want you guys
to have a voice in all of this it's not
about what I think I mean I am kind of
the the meat of the show right I'm
talking about these systems as we go
through them but ultimately you guys can
like have a warfare in chat as long as
its respective or respectful of course
and try to state your point of view to
convince any of the live audience
members that that they shouldn't vote or
they should vote on a particular pc for
the reasons that you've given them
that's that's kind of what this whole
thing is about so feel free to blow up
chat all you want it's it's a it's all
part of the it comes with the territory
i suppose but on that note before we
dive into our first i should say our
last five pcs of the day of the season
let's go ahead and take a quick look at
our sponsor because honestly i keep
saying this but this show wouldn't be
around or possible without our sponsors
so fantex yet yet again for season one
in the month of februari is our lovely
sponsor today and i'm showing off their
eclipse p400 excellent case i had a
chance to look at it over at CES this
year just about a month ago and just
outstanding features for the price that
you pay for it this is really for an
entry-level to mid-range builder who's
looking to also do some custom water
cooling if not just some basic air
cooling as well but it does come in
three colors you've got black white and
this really nice titanium gray type of
type of deal it's like a sixty or
seventy dollar case it really is just a
very nice price point and you do get
some RGB LEDs at the bottom they're not
I think you can select I think there's
ten different options I might have been
incorrect last week but I think there's
ten different options which will take a
closer look at later and how they're how
it's really compatible with fan Texas
LED strips as well
that color correspond to the the color
of your case so really cool stuff we're
going to take a closer look at this
later but stay tuned for that thank you
very much fantex for sponsoring this
show we love you all I actually have a
fan text case right there and there's
another case that wifey sauce is on
right over there so yeah why don't we go
ahead and take a look at our first
contestant for this week I'm going to
cue up some some BG tracks y'all word to
get our jam going here to get the vibe
going first system of the day Josh no
this is not fractal Josh this is just
Josh if this was fractal Josh probably
wouldn't be rocking a thermaltake case
even though the two have been known to
be strikingly similar not going to get
into that right now but we've got a
thermaltake core v70 one epically huge
case great for water cooling custom
water cooling all that sort of thing a
lot of radiator support i forgot to
disable flux so i'm like why is my
screen suddenly turning orange things
are about to go rip okay there we go
I've got a core i5 6600 k a thermaltake
water three point 0 ultimate that's a
360 aio rad pretty nice little cooler
there looks pretty snap snazzy got an
msi Z 178 crate gaming p my anarchie 16
gig ddr for kit sapphire nitro radeon r9
380 for gigabyte card i see no problems
with our GPU cpu pairings here there's
at least not going to be any kind of GPU
bottleneck which is nice 750 series SSD
you got some Envy any action in there
400 gigs with that entail baby yeah I've
got the same one in a hot line actually
it's a really nice really nice SSD you
gotta Mishkin 240 gig as well and a 750
watt power supply yes it's lagging ok if
it's lagging a little bit I can maybe
cut the music down and and maybe maybe
that will help maybe this you know
actually this is um I'm going to take a
quick quick digression here
because now that I've started streaming
this show I've noticed that it's it's
actually more intensive to run booted
than it is awesome hardware because Paul
and I run awesome hardware every Tuesday
no problem on this system that i have
over here my little stream box it it's a
mini ITX build so it only has a black
magic capture card in that pcie slot
doesn't have a discrete card we're
actually running off of 4770k the entire
time with no actual dedicated GPU but I
think maybe just the nature of booted
with all the you know some of the
high-res images and just the different
layers that are involved I am seeing a
higher cpu usage than than i am on
awesome hardware so i think i think guys
a stream box 2 point 0 might be in order
where i actually get a micro ATX board
or something similar to actually include
the capture card as well as a discrete
video card so maybe that's a video that
you guys can look forward to in the near
future and really something that i
should get on very soon because i do
apologize for the lag it could also be a
a twitter youtube thing versus at which
thing perhaps twitch just seems to
operate a bit better they've been in the
game a little bit longer but i'll
definitely investigate further so thank
you for bearing with me and the show as
we encounter some of these beginning
technical difficulties but going back
nope that's not the right guy let's go
to Josh going back to our show here yeah
I think your hardware setup is fairly
decent here some things that stick out
to me right off the bat is that power
supply sticker just the power supply in
general thank you very much for the
donation Jordan appreciate that buddy I
can feel the love tonight baby it is
strong it is getting all up getting all
up ons this this fine body of mine yo
could feel it on my six pack that's
buried deep underneath my one pack
that's just a big conglomerate of fat
anyway thank you for pointing that out
Jordan um yeah okay so cables cables and
power supply that sticker is absolutely
atrocious Josh you should feel bad that
is bad sticker and you should feel bad
take the power supply sticker off also
those cables aren't doing much for you
either ketchup and mustard typical I
think if they were just straight-up
black sleeve cables it would look so
much nicer and you do have some blue
accents going on here with the hard
drive cage as well as the front of the
case that's just a you know nature of
the case and you do it does look like
you have what's going on here those look
like does look like you have some some
blue on your heat spreaders not exactly
sure if that's the same shade of blue as
is on your case looks kind of more like
a genuine royal blue as compared to like
a lighter baby blue or something like
that but nonetheless really the thing
that's sticking out like a sore thumb
here are those are those ketchup and
mustard cables so either get you know
some some sleeved extensions or just
swap out the power supply entirely maybe
a higher higher end model and that could
be nice you've also got some blue LED
fans at the front you're showing off
here I would have liked to see a blue
LED strip at the top of your case or
even at the back to just provide a bit
more even lighting all around I think
that would have been really nice that I
don't know there's just a color
coordination thing for me but you know
overall overall this is a pretty solid
build I think there are definitely
things to be upgraded here as far as
cable management goes it kind of looks
like the the fan cables that you have
from these uh I don't know if it's from
your your radiator fans but they're kind
of just dangling down from the rafters
of your case at least the one that's you
know just going straight across your
radiator there and the one going off to
the left it just looks like it could
have been tightened up a lot more and
those cables could have maybe been
hidden behind the radiator itself
because it's a it's a big radiator you
can actually use that that hardware to
shield or mask off some of the cables
that you have running in the same
direction in that general area so I feel
like that was a missed opportunity I
don't think there's probably much you
could have done with that HD audio
connector that's way at the bottom of
your system that's just running straight
across all the way like it's going like
halfway across your case just to get
into that rubber grommet I think maybe
putting that in the the grommet by your
power supply would have been a smarter
move and not quite as obvious it would
have been a bit more discreet head you
just routed it to the nearest
rubber grommet in that case but all
together pretty solid build we'll see
what the audience thinks overall but
thank you very much Josh for that entry
next up we've got Nick Nick's got an
NZXT case oh boy Illuminati confirmed
we've got another NZXT case but it's an
s3 40 it is white but it's an s3 40 it's
not an H for 40 thank God sick of seeing
those cases no they're beautiful they
really are but we've got an intel core
i5 4590 paired with a z97 board hmm so
um that's that that might cost you some
points and again the points here don't
matter all right the points you don't
matter that's just uh just like who's
line is anyway but I feel like you know
if you were going to spend the extra
dough on a z97 board probably pair that
with an unlocked sku processor so you
can do some overclocking and really take
advantage of all the benefits that come
with that chipset nonetheless I can see
why you chose that motherboard because
it is very nice its budget more or less
and and it just matches perfectly with
everything else in your system being a
black and white themed case it it really
does kind of tie everything together
having that motherboard in there along
with the RAM and that cry rig cooler
that's a pretty badass cooler that you
got in there with a white bladed fan I
think that's a nice touch looking at the
money shot this definitely looks pretty
snazzy I like it a lot um yeah I'm sorry
guys I don't know why I'm dropping
frames all over the place but you know
hopefully these being mainly images you
can just not look at my hideous face
right now in 10 FPS and all will be
gravy I'll try not to do the the main
camera of myself too often in this in
this particular episode but you've also
got these flat black rubbery cables and
while they're not horrible and they're
much better than ketchup and mustard I
still feel like it takes away from that
premium look and feel that you get with
a lot of really nice custom DIY pcs that
usually have you know either like
paracord sleeving um you know or like
the battaglios brand of sleeving fabric
even like bitfenix or Silverstone
extensions look to me a lot nicer
in my opinion then this this flat black
business but uh but it also it is also
very functional because they're there a
lot thinner and can fit behind your
motherboard tray a lot easier so I do
appreciate that taking a look at your
LED shot yeah yeah all right you've got
a white LED very nice that makes sense I
was I would expect that you you would
have a white LED in there it is at the
bottom or I'm sorry at the top of your
case and again it looks a little bit
one-sided I'm not sure also why the why
this image is shrunk down i should have
enlarged that i'm sorry about that but
um yeah you know it looks a little bit
harsh to me it's probably just because
of the photo and again with LEDs I'm
getting more and more accustomed to
seeing them all around your case you
know really nice high-end system
especially like a water-cooling build or
something has like LED strips on
multiple edges or multiple sides of the
chassis so that you get a really even
amount of lighting and even coat and it
just looks a little bit too harsh at the
top and not enough illumination at the
bottom and that could be a bit jarring
when you're looking at I'm sure it
doesn't look quite as a drastic in
person but right here it looks like the
scene of a horror movie or something I'm
scared looking at this picture but
overall not a bad system Nick again with
that hardware configuration your CPU and
GPU kind of wish that wasn't unlocks key
because then I'd know that you were also
taking advantage of that cry or a cooler
to do some pretty hefty overclocking and
that would have been nice to see but
overall will let the audience decide on
that one thank you very much Nick moving
on to our third PC Jason Jason Jason
Jason this is a very nice build we've
got a Corsair 780ti think it's the first
one first seven ATT that we've seen on
booted so far in this first season we've
got a core i5 4690 k with a corsair h60
cooler as e 9 z 97 gaming 3 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance sapphire r9 380 and
some SS an SSD in there as well as hard
drive and power supply alright let's
take a look at the side profile
okay uh I like how you are revealing
your SSD because it's red and it's kind
of matching the other red elements in
your system I like how you remove the
hard drive cages and only kept the one
that you needed for that that WD green
in there I think that's a smart choice
and overall this is a nice red themed
build but a couple things uh your your
RAM for one is blue and at first I was
like why did he go with blue heat
spreaders they they definitely have that
model kit in red I'm pretty sure and I
couldn't tell why you decided that but
then I saw this picture and clearly you
were going for some kind of two tone red
and blue you know police siren theme um
and that's fine you know that's you
that's that's what you like this is your
taste and I'm perfectly cool with that
however uh I also think that because you
have the the blue heat spreaders on your
RAM up at the top where the red LED is
primarily shining it kind of masks off
the blue that you get on those heat
spreaders so it kind of dulls it is what
it does it doesn't accentuate it it
dulls it and I feel like you know for
whatever reason if the heat spreaders if
there were blue elements on the lower
half of your case if there were more if
there was more blue stuff on the lower
half of that system it would probably
work a bit better because then you would
actually accentuate those those blue
accents accentuate the accents who knew
and I think that would make a bit more
sense but also I'm not also not sure
about this whole two-tone concept in
general because at least with this
system it looks like all the main the
meat and potatoes of your rig is all on
the top half I mean really the only
thing that's getting illuminated at the
bottom half of your chassis is you know
kind of like your your the video carded
the video card and the lower half of
your motherboard which also kind of gets
washed out because you've got red red
heat sinks got a red heat sink on that
chipset that's being washed out with
blue so I mean it's just not my taste
but it is yours we'll leave it to the
audion
to decide whether or not it's for them
whether they can see your side of the
story and what you're trying to do but
cable management is pretty on point I
see some ketchup and mustard at the
bottom here coming from that giant cut
out for your power supply but when you
take a look at again at the the system
with the side panel on you realize you
really can't see that so I'm okay with
that I'm not really going to fault you
for that no points docked but yeah but
she had the other thing the other thing
that stood out to me here is the little
tiny purple accent that you have on your
sapphire card on your video card I know
it's really small and it's it's you
could easily be written off as
negligible but for whatever reason it
bothers me just i would put like some
black electrical tape over it or spray
painted black just to get rid of it it's
just your your eyes are very in tune
with color and they can you know since
the differences spot the differences
very easily so that kind of sticks out
to me um but overall I think what you've
done here is pretty nice also the fan
your ear your rear fan is gray I feel
like maybe get just a you know a
standard black frame with white blade
fan a white bladed fan would look really
nice in here because you've got a black
and white case so just some suggestions
on my end and my two cents on this but
hopefully you'll sell the audience on
this one you've done a pretty bang-up
job you Jason so very nice job job well
done next up pc number four is hano hano
i hope i'm pronouncing your name right
is it ha no ha no i don't know but your
name's not important right now your
system is we've got here isn't indexed
eh 440 oh god oh god it's nice for 40
everyone shield your eyes grab up your
pitchforks uh at least it's not white
right it's black and white I mean Jesus
it's red and black I'm not color blind
can confirm so that's good at the very
least if you win we won't have three
straight up white edition age 4 40's
because then yeah then I'll then I'll be
definitely accused of racism but taking
a look at your specs here we've got a
another core i5
4430 with a z97 board maximus 7 hero
again kind of a Miss a mismatching a
missed opportunity with the overclocking
board and the non overclockable cpu
that's that's got to hurt a little bit
there's some points docked right there
you've got eight gigs of kingston hyperx
savage msi gtx 960 the gaming gaming
series from msi four gigs 256 gig
crucial be x100 great budget SSD and
we've also got a one terabyte seagate
and a 600 watt coolermaster power supply
that's definitely enough to power the
system okay so judging from this picture
right off the bat very clean cable
management I love the sleeving I think
it fits it suits your system absolutely
perfectly I'm not a huge fan of the
striped sleeving where it's just you
know repetitive black white black white
or you know red black red black but it
works really well here and
congratulations for that kudos to you on
that bro it also kind of matches the the
heat spreaders on your ram because your
ram is also kind of striped in the same
way with it with the whole black and red
alternating theme going on however when
we take a look at your money shot there
are some issues that I have with your
intel stock cooler and I understand why
you did the things that you did to kind
of mask the ugliest parts of it
including that Center sticker that
circular sticker right in the middle
that's like a nasty white and other
colors and then that hideous fan cable
that's like yellow and green it's all
the wrong colors that you'd want in your
system and what you've done here it
looks like you've put like a thin layer
of tape or black tape or paint over that
Center sticker you've just paint it's
right over it but it's bubbling up to a
degree where it kind of looks like a
burnt pancake and I'm not too sure that
really blends with the overall clean
look of your system I think that's
really killing the vibe here that I'm
getting from from from your your rig
here and it's a shame because it's right
front and center it's like the first
thing you see when you look at a system
it is like the absolute center that your
eyes tend to gravitate towards and it's
it's just it doesn't look very pretty to
me
also the the red tape I don't know if
it's tape that you used it kind of looks
like tape that you've kind of lined the
the fan cable with but from afar I could
see how it works and you really wouldn't
notice it from from this distance about
you you couldn't really tell maybe in
person you can tell a bit easier but
when you get up close to it it
definitely looks kind of a haphazardly
thrown together it just gives kind of a
cheapens the overall look of the system
and I think that's really your weak
point here man because everything else
is pretty solid I will say from the
cable management to the hardware
selection you're pretty spot-on but that
cpu cooler I think could really be
detrimental to your overall voting I
should also point out the SSD and I
meant to call this up earlier but I like
what you've done here you've just
painted it completely red I think you
spray-painted it looks that way anyway
and it works it works it just makes it
blend in very nicely especially with the
red accent on that power supply shroud
that you get from the h 4 40 you didn't
try to go too crazy and just spray paint
certain elements you kept it really
simple and minimalistic which I think
was a good call so good on you mate for
that coal but you had a cpu cooler you
know and that and that mismatched
overclocking opportunity I think if you
had a locked case Q and a better cooler
that was after market you would
definitely be in the running for like
even on my end like I would probably
vote for the system but well it remains
to be seen whether or not that is going
to sway the audience in one way or
another and lastly we've got Gabriel yet
another NZXT case I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna have a booted season where
it's just NZXT cases cuz this is insane
I didn't realize how many freaking
people have NZ I mean I did from pit my
pc and stuff but holy bejesus there's a
lot of these things s 340 it's a hot
ticket man I tell you so we've got an
AMD fx-8350 40 good cooler another crate
edition board the 978 chipsets and we've
got 16 gigs of king
Stan hyperx fury 16 I don't know why you
wrote 16 twice we've got a gtx 960 super
super clocked at four gigs and an ocz
arc 100-120 gigabyte SSD so let's take a
look at the side here okay okay again
we're going with a black and white
themed NZXT system I think I think that
there's definitely a conspiracy going on
here but i'm not going to fault you for
it no points docked you you couldn't
have known unless you were part of the
conspiracy of course that black and
white systems we're going to do really
well on season one of booted and you've
done a nice pairing job here with your
your color matching the rear fan of
course comes with that case I believe
you've also got the white fury heat
spreaders on that Ram kit which is
pretty primo uh the issue that I'm
having here right now is with the cpu
cooler enermax has a twister t40 cooler
that's very similar to this one that's
all white it's got white fans it's got
white LEDs on it and it's got a white
heat sink I actually use it in the white
build that I did a while back I feel
like that would look a lot nicer in here
right off the bat as opposed to the
chrome chrome finish of the traditional
heat sink here kind of just gives it a
more just just a more like fluid overall
theme with the rest of your system here
also that fan that's definitely i don't
know i don't think that's an enter max
fan it looks like a fan Tex fan or maybe
an NZXT fan is definitely not a stock
fan that came with that cooler and it's
great and that kind of trips me up even
though the eye can see that the the fan
blades are definitely white the fan
itself does not match really with the
rest of your system and I think that's
going to have to cost you some points
man because I think just a regular black
and white fan would have done wonders
for this and also it's kind of
interesting that you have it on the left
side of your heat sink and not the right
side because generally you would have it
on the right side of your heat sink
pushing air through your fin array and
out the back of your case but you've got
it in kind of this pull configuration
which generally isn't as common
and this being I'm very familiar with
this cooler it being the very slim
cooler that it is with that heat sink
you probably could have afforded to put
that fan on the right side perhaps get a
degree or two a better performance
cooling performance for your for your FX
chip there and I think it would have
looked a little bit nicer too so that's
probably what I would have done had I
been you cable management however is
very solid again we've got a you've art
I've already spoken my my mind on the
flat black cables while they're much
better than ketchup and mustard it's
kind of like a stop gap between those
and fully sleeved black extensions and I
think that would also amp up the look of
your rig overall so yeah yeah not a bad
system though bro this is very clean
overall I gotta hand it to you uh and i
think that ladies and gentlemen is
pretty much those are all five of the
systems for episode three oh my god why
is it so chops why is it so damn
shopping urn okay before I talk too much
more I am going to pause the broadcast
change the bit rate and then come back
come back on so don't go anywhere guys
i'm only at about sixty percent cpu
usage so it might be the bitrate that i
put it at is a little bit too choppy a
little too high give me a second I live
yes I was resting in peace and now I
have returned from the dead undead Kyle
hashtag for the win it still looks
choppy I don't know what's going on guys
but um when I was testing it earlier
today it seemed fine and I guess I guess
it's all your fault it's really all your
fault no I'll take a deeper look at it
later on this week I'm really I really
do apologize for the bit of choppiness
so hopefully you can just bear with me
for one more episode I'm really going to
try to get to the bottom of it by next
week but on that note let's go ahead and
quickly switch over to our recap of
today's contestants first off we have
we got Josh this is number one PC number
one take note of which number correlates
corresponds to each of these systems
next up we have pc number 2 p's and
number two with doge and then we've got
PC number three visit number 3 pc number
4 x4 40 master race and pc numero Cinco
okay all right right about now you
should be seeing a link in chat being
posted by wifey sauce she'll be pasting
the link eight or nine times in chat so
that you all have a chance to click it
and go ahead and vote on which pc you
think deserves to go on to the final
round next week in week for the final
round guys it's going to be epic I've
got I've gone ahead and put the
thumbnails of each contestant with their
corresponding numbers here so you can
kind of give them one last glance and
really think about who deserves to win
if you guys don't think that a certain
system should win you think how
everyone's like leaning towards this one
guy feel free to speak your two cents in
chat and really think about it guys
really think about which pc is the most
well composed here has the best
sensibility as far as hardware hardware
compatibility is very important here not
just about looks I know we talked a lot
about looks because that's what we see
their pictures their images and that's
kind of what you know we have to go on
visually but it's also about the the
hardware selection as well so um bear
that in mind but in the meantime let's
go ahead while you guys are voting and
thinking very considerably about who
deserves to go on to Round four let's
take another look at our sponsor here
we've got the Eclipse p400 I did also
want to mention that they have the p400
s which is a silent edition of this case
everything's pretty much the same except
you get sound dampening material kind of
like on the side panels at the top I
believe on the front as well so just
more quiet operation which is really
nice and
again about that that led business on
the case here a good example that I can
can use for how the LED system on this
chassis works is with the enthu Lux
because the enthu Lux is actually also
compatible with fan texts RGB strips so
if you connect the internal LED strips
to the case then any time you change the
case color LED it will also change the
LED strips and here's actually an
example and it's about to get really
choppy sauce right now let me go ahead
and change the quality on this bad boy
scuse moi we're going 480p guys we're
living in the Stone Age yeah definitely
a stream box 2 point 0 needs to happen
but you can see the LED strips that I
have in the white belt here and just by
connecting it to the case and changing
the color the LED color on the chassis
also updates the RGB strip inside inside
of the system there so 10 10 colors
overall I believe are at your fingertips
with the Eclipse very excellent here's a
nice little shot here's a the LED strip
itself you can either get it in one
meter or two meter I'm disappointed that
the the role doesn't increase in size
when you go from one meter 2 meter it
should be like twice as twice as big but
it's not and here all the different
colors that you can get out of these
strips these trips are really good like
the brightness is pretty solid the only
thing that all but I'll warn you guys
about is the adhesive isn't the greatest
so maybe get some adhesive tape of your
own or just get some some velcro get
some good old adhesive velcro and strep
that sucker down but overall overall
definitely check this out there's a link
in the description below guys if you
want to find out more about this case it
takes you right to the fantex website
it's not too hard to find the Eclipse
p400 and P 400s you've also got 360
radiator support at the front of the
chassis which is pretty epic for a case
in this price point so if you guys are
interested in getting into some water
cooling whether it be custom or aio and
you're on a budget you really want to
save some money on a chassis so you can
spend more of it elsewhere in your
system go ahead and check it out but
that is pretty much
I'll have to say about sponsor spots so
uh yeah why don't we go ahead who take a
look at our votes and stuff it's a it's
voting time well you guys are already
guess already done your voting let's go
ahead and take a look at the straw poll
boom alright so again 5pcs gave it their
all and I had a lot of entries for this
season because it was the first season
these five were lucky enough to make it
into onto the show in the first place
but unfortunately only one of them can
be a finalist the last finalist for
season one and the other four will be
going home with nothing so on that note
who is our Week three finalists for
season one of booted it is PC number for
PC number four by quite a landslide with
two hundred and four votes four hundred
of you guys voted in total with PC
number three being the runner up so who
is PC number for that was hano hano you
son of a gun it's an H for 40 Illuminati
confirmed holy balls man well
congratulations I did speak my piece
about your your stock cooler there but
overall you had a really nice system
clearly the audience felt the same way
cuz damn that that might have been the
biggest landslide victory in this season
so far I don't think we've seen another
pc lead by that much so damn it's going
to be like in h 4 40 pretty much
three-way a three-way it's going to be a
three-way competition between these age
for 40 cases two of them white and one
of them red being you Han oh so
congratulations sir excellent build I
think those cables really did you a
solid ultimately those sexy ass cables
let's go ahead and take a look really
quick again at the last two weeks
finalists got Luke on the left from week
one and Mitchell on the right from last
week
yeah yeah this is gonna be good it's
gonna be good guys he's gonna be good
