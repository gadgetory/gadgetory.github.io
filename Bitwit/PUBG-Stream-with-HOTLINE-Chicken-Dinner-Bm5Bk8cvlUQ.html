going everyone we are now streaming live
to twitch this is just a little
impromptu stream that I fired up last
minute basically we're gonna be playing
some pub G as you can see I've got the
MSI Afterburner OSD here so we've got
readouts for system Diagnostics that you
guys can actually monitor real-time as
we play the game unfortunately I don't
have a second dedicated streaming system
set up so obviously framerate and
temperatures and things like that are
gonna be affected by the fact that we're
also live streaming and recording
locally from the gaming system here
which is hotline we're actually using
hotline 69 50 X overclocked to 4.4
gigahertz on all course don't remember
the voltage off the top of my head but
we were actually running one of the gtx
980ti is disabled so we're not doing sli
i was noticing a little bit of
choppiness playing pub g specifically
with sli i don't know if that's just a
unique scenario or if multiple people
have been experiencing that but we're
just doing the single gtx 980ti which is
overclocked I think we've got like a 200
megahertz offset on that bad boy on the
core clock another 250 megahertz on the
memory clock hello hello everyone in
chat hope your day is going well
also Jay fish media
boo yes focus G is a pretty sweet case
for the money I must say alright enough
of this
nan seeing around let me go let me show
you guys the quality here quality
settings 2560 by 1440 of course you guys
are watching it at 1080p 60fps got
everything maxed out Ultra ultra ultra
ultra being disabled all right and I
should warn you guys that I dunno how to
play this game but I'm not very good at
it like at all and I haven't really
logged many hours probably like maybe
like less than five oh this is more to
just showcase this is more to just have
a good time and and just showcase hot
line and what she can do in this early
access game it's like we're in
matchmaking now this is the rivatuner
statistics and afterburner that we're
using for the OS duty the OS deuce notes
yeah and if this game crashes I might
have to restart the stream because for
some reason I'm running into some weird
bug where it doesn't let me relaunch the
game unless I restart my computer which
is terrifying when you're when it's the
title you're live streaming so we'll see
what happens just just have no
expectations if your bar is right here
you might want to lower it just just a
tad alright match starting in 30 seconds
prepare to die all of you you have met
your match vit wits coming for you big
weights coming for you hey I just saw a
girl that looked just like you
she was she was like right here right
here she is hey I found here I found
your lost long-lost sister she's right
over here well you found each other oh
no it'll go away oh that was gonna be
such a sweet reunion and now it's just
ended in bloodshed and in tears tears
everywhere we could have had a family
all right here we go
North America server yes yes yes indeed
so right now it's like we're getting
about 45 FPS there abouts gpus pretty
much under full load
look trading between a 80s and 99% where
do I drop guys all right guys guys in
chat tell me what a drop tell me what I
should eject I'm not gonna eject them
till you tell me to first person that
says he Jack I'm gonna do it obviously
the delay is gonna throw everything up
so that's gonna be hilarious now okay
Pinky Dinky wit them to hell I'm going
all right let's see now I'm much more
familiar with h1z1 the name with this
game and if h1z1 stew taught me anything
is its to not land in a giant city at
the beginning of the game so I'm gonna
go to this weird little area here it
doesn't look too massive let's see do I
have any other peeps following me no it
looks like I'm pretty I'm pretty
isolated here so that's good
let's go and if you guys like I'm like
oh my god there's tons of people here No
abort abort I'm gonna go to this small
house small house I'm not good enough to
take on a crowd like that yet I'm just
doing solo by the way that's poor spot
to drop oh good oh good I'm glad I
listened to the first guy all right what
are you guys doing right now it's like
middle of the day on a Tuesday where I
am right now are you guys at work school
how are you watching me right now is
that a candy bar this thing's all
boarded up oh shit oh my wait pick up
the is that it what is that a gun no oh
oh my god that guy did you just oh no
there's another guy right there oh my
god no no I will punch you to death I
will punch you wait he didn't he didn't
kill me
why didn't he why didn't he kill me
bro you should have totally killed me
but thank you for not oh I'm scared now
okay I'm at least familiar enough with
this game to know that you should kill
someone when you see them so either that
guy just maybe he's just oh no no I'm
still here bro bro let's hang out let's
come on let's hang out dude I am so
unarmed right now oh my goodness well he
doesn't look like he's out of ammo
anymore I honestly don't know okay
here's the plan I'm gonna wait for him
to run around the corner and then I'm
just gonna start punching him in the
face and he'll die whoo there's another
guys do you see a guy in the window do
you see the guy in the window oh maybe
was that the same guy or maybe he's
gonna come and kill the guy who was
shooting me
get out of that room to the left run run
no this is dead end okay just give me a
gun please really like a gun can I get
out of this window nope nope nope
run oh my god oh my god I'm so scared I
don't want to look behind I don't wanna
look back I don't look back don't look
back don't look back look back just a
little bit okay nothing I think we're
good
just keep running keep running keep
running keep running to burn a different
head for the bushes there are no bushes
where do you go with her or no bushes oh
my god
use the med kit okay as soon as I take
cover here behind this rock cuz this
rock is impenetrable and will protect me
from everything let's see med kit yes
using med kit ha ha ha ha ha ha joke's
on you guy who almost killed me whew
alright I'm good I'm feeling good and
feeling pumped we ramped oh god yeah I
got the old thing it's something that
they poured it over from we're borrowed
from h1z1
okay step one guys get a gun let's see
okay
okay I'm still in the safe zone looking
good all right find a car I think I
should find a gun before I find a car
but a car would be ideal ooh I'm gonna
go to that little little town right
there you know I found in in games like
this just avoiding all contact at the
very last minute is what gets you the
farthest oh I just saw a dude running
out there in the distance he's going to
that little town that towns compromised
what if what if I find like the most
badass weapon in this little little
shithole
come on crack shack oh oh I'll take it
all friggin take it with that to load
look at that
I'm ready I'm ready for battle not quite
let's let's run away from where I know
the people are autorun look ma no hands
okay all right so just some observations
the explosions that sounds great
what's up everyone just joining chat
what Abby's manifest
doo-doo-doo-doo and a suppressor in a
shed once maybe I'll be is lucky
what is behind door number two ooh take
that smoke grenade why thank you
another more stuff and a grip boom more
bullets that's good okay am i I'm in the
safe zone still I should probably do I
dare go towards that little neighborhood
I'm gonna go lose it a tone sorry I'm
like 80
ADHD right now squirrel squirrel what's
up our Fox Junior don't shoot
let's go into this creepy tunnel
what ooh I get to loot some stuff here
yeah doesn't really have anything how do
I whatever it looks like crap to me
we're going in guys we're going in
someone in here hello Lou this is cool I
didn't I didn't realise this game had
like little underground areas like this
and it looks like it's doing us some
favors in the frame rate Department FPS
shut up a good five ten it's a lot of
repeat textures and stuff to be expected
and not a single weapon or here we go
so we've got one of those so I'll just
be I'll just be the pistol man I'll be
pistol guy now where exactly is this
leading me most likely to my certain
death but more specifically where is it
going
ahaha backpack thank you
yes I'll take all of that switch to can
i all right whatever mmm
yes give it to me give it to me hold on
wife and stuff is calling hi honey
you're on stream yeah your voice sounds
awful did you start smoking cigarettes
or what oh yeah you're sick I forgot
yeah Ruby is is good yeah chicken
burrito or how about a fish burrito give
me like a fish and shrimp burrito
all right thank you bye what a great
wife getting her husband food as he
streams pub G in front of a live
audience I've got it made let me tell ya
she is seriously awesome though
alright I think we've made it out of the
tunnel yes okay
apocalyptic shit going down right now
but totally alright but you know what
that means they just cleared out anyone
who might have been in this area so I
got this let me go oh no I died I died
right okay well lesson learned don't go
into the red zone I mean I kind of knew
that but I didn't I didn't think it was
really gonna get me that time all right
now please don't crash last time the
game crashed when I did this cross cross
everything guys
I think we're good I think we're good oh
thank god alright let's jump back in
strepek in just getting warmed up here
just getting warmed up alright let's see
how you guys doing really you've never
seen anyone die in the red zone before
well maybe I'm just that bad and that
bad I can't even first video already
came out on floatplane the HTTP see
video that I did we're upgrading it
transforming it from HTPC to gaming
system that is already live on the float
planes should be going on the main
channel soon this one no I haven't tried
out fortnight yet
I would like to though I've heard it's
it's pretty good obviously there's a lot
of you know criticism that it's too
similar to pub G or whatever but I don't
mind that sort of thing so much I feel
for the developer for Blue Hole and
stuff but if it's another fun game that
I can enjoy why not it's all good to me
I broke the match
yes hit up the floatplane so we've got a
gtx 980ti in here which is overclocked
by about two hundred megahertz on the
core clock we've been seeing anywhere
from sixty to right now about 75 75 FPS
although I have seen a couple dips into
the 50s maybe even the forties just
depending what's interesting is I was
testing it with SLI earlier and I think
Nvidia released a driver several weeks
ago that would enable SLI for this
particular game but I didn't really see
much of a jump and and I was getting
some micro stutter which got six all
right you know what you know what I'm
gonna break my rule I'm just gonna go to
this really really busy area and yeah
I'm gonna take my chances
doing it
oh yeah this game is like the least
optimized title ever right now granted
stolen early access and stuff so I can't
fault them too much but yeah it's it is
buggy AF but that just goes to show you
how well-received this game is despite
all the technical issues it's still the
number one stream game I don't know if
it still is but I mean it's it's it's up
there it's one of the big ones it's
quite quite fun come on give me some
stuff give me what you got
what do you got what do you got what is
this a little ol hand what is that a
crowbar no that's a it's the arm the
recoil oh my goodness oh jeez I could be
like Darrell from Walking Dead now give
me just give me all the arrows give me
those arrows yes Delfy as a mofo there
we go yup so you guys also notice that
the single GTX 1080 or 980ti
is at about 63 see right now which it's
it's quite a few degrees warmer than it
was when I first built it oh my god nope
nope nope nope nope not doing that not
doing that there's a guy Oh
odo oh my god he was so good he had a
gun all I had was like would I hit a
bunch of wooden arrows uh I've warned
you guys I warned you I was bad at this
game so yeah what now
rip okay it's cool it's cool I'm gonna
continue playing as long as the game
lets me this is like the longest I've
played pub G without it crashing I'm
excited yeah
cell and his team killing habits oh god
don't even get me started playing h1z1
with that guy my goodness he's he better
be lucky that he's a good moderator for
us from hardware otherwise we would
probably never talk have nothing to do
with it no I'm just kidding cells cells
my spirit animal I love him all right
you think you're all special and unique
with your funky hair do you yeah you
can't even you can't even take a punch
that's right what's your deal what's
your deal you just look like you look
like my ex so screw you
yep sorry damn genetics does not even
guess if there's there's no there's no
gas here right now this is what are you
what are you doing what are you trying
to prove you are you one of those
paranoid the paranoid schizophrenic is
that Sabbath this is okay just
unnecessarily tormenting all the afk or
just gonna run around aimlessly wait for
the match to begin I kept killed like
probably five people in this game since
I started playing that's it over the
total lifespan of be playing this just
kind of sad
come on a sad but we're gonna change
that today aren't we all right guys you
know what to do let me know when to drop
my fate is in your hands come on
tell me when to go waiting for it
waiting for it eyes on chat alright
Rob's low to listen to you oh alright
with with literally half the server
jumping along with me this is fantastic
okay where to go I'm gonna go to the
little the little tiny area just pass
the road there a little bit on the
outskirts where am I in relation to
everything else so I am literally on the
island that sounds like a bad place to
be when the map closes in every few
minutes is there a way to go faster when
you're on the parachute
I mean I'm holding w I haven't figured
out a way to do it if there is get a gun
and guard the bridge yeah I'm sure that
it'll stand no chance against me no one
will get past me on that old bridge okay
that doesn't oh I heard something that
was like a door
car door closing okay there's nothing
here
a grenade holger need them all to death
yes is that hello hey no one misses with
a guy holding a bomb right just back off
people save yourself the headache and
that's others oh well hello give that to
me alright I got this
in the bag
you'll regret the day you met me just
watch Oh
shots fired I'm going in guys I'm going
in
you'll never see me coming just watch
just watch
okay
the heck is everyone go get get over the
thing oh oh oh there's action there's
lots of action here crouching yo hey I I
come in peace if anyone's there if
anyone can hear me do not shoot I
definitely won't shoot you if I see you
so let's just have let's just talk about
this let's use words and not bullets
okay I'm friendly friendly over here oh
there's more gunshots in that direction
oh there's lots of gunshots over there
let's let's chase it down let's see
what's going on I am almost walking into
certain death here
oh no oh no oh no
fuck fuck that oh my god this guy does
he see where I am you know I think that
he knows oh there was another guy
there's another guy where is he
shit
Oh oh Jesus nope nope go away I see you
I see you right there
you're coming no was that was that lag
or something it looked like he used a
special power to speed across me look at
how fast he moved what you guys saw that
right you guys okay speed hacker okay
thank God I I thought I was just really
slow right no that was not lag that was
too convenient to be lag guys you don't
lag right at the best moment in order to
get you that kill you lag right before
you you're about to kill someone and
then they kill you instead that was
hacking that was bonafide hacking and I
don't feel bad as bad as I as I did for
dying just they're still at 64 C on the
GPU CPU is looking a little bit warm I
mean granted this is a pretty CPU
intensive game and it's poorly optimized
but still the fact that we're hitting 70
C I should give it some credit though it
is a 10 core it is a 10 core but with a
custom loop granted I should be I should
be fair here and say that I have been
very bad and neglecting the neglecting
hotline haven't really given her a
proper cleaning I would like drained out
the loop and cleaned the innards of it
in quite some time so that's definitely
gonna drop me down on some thermal
performance
the other idea that I want to share with
you guys is doing more Let's Plays like
this where I actually have the OSD up so
you guys can monitor all the Diagnostics
as I play and also letting you guys
choose you know by voting which game I'm
playing which hardware I'm using and
that sort of thing which settings in
game and etc I thought it would be kind
of interesting and kind of like a let's
play but a little bit more informative
than your typical let's play where you
guys can actually just see some hardware
in action that you'd otherwise not have
access to if you guys let me know if you
guys think that's a cool idea or you
know what what game I should play next
and of course this would be done this
would all be done with a second
dedicated streaming PC so all the
performance you'd be seeing would only
reflect the gaming system and it would
not be bogged down at all by streaming
or recording tasks etc
that's a GPU usage that first metric is
GPU usage so right now it's like it 79
79 in the 90s
Assassin's Creed origins alright alright
someone to go guys tell me when to go
wait GPU used into is that 104 I missed
that
that is what okay dropping Thank You
bear oh yeah I see one hundred and three
hundred and five that's weird it's I
definitely selected GPU usage and not
with power within MSI Afterburner
settings it's a it's technically
impossible to use more than a hundred
percent of your GPU so I'm not sure I am
using an older version of afterburner I
didn't get a chance to update it just
before the stream but I'll look into
that
I'll double-check to see if actually
while I'm falling to my certain death I
can well I don't want to mess up the
game so I'll let you guys know before I
in the stream if I remember specs of the
radiators on the hotline there's a 360
on top and a 240
yeah 240 on the front so we've got about
600 millimetres of radiator cooling
potential I did not mean to open my
shoot early if I did it's just because
I'm a noob and I don't really have a
good excuse mmm look at this little
little little house here
I'm sure it has loads of treasures for
plundering giant haystacks a label these
haystacks maybe I should play Assassin's
Creed origins next pom pom pom pom pom
who a bandage yes sexy and another
bandage am I gonna pick up all that OOP
oh here we go here we go
all right all righty I'm gonna be a bit
more tactical this time around I don't
like dying so quickly so let's just see
what we got in here 46 45 flash hider
for the AR I don't really have an AR so
no thanks for now I should probably turn
my game volume up and cook game volume
up a little bit because it's a little
difficult to hear footsteps coming in
things like that let's try that sorry
for the brief pause
these fools where did I get dropped by
the way okay so I'm just on the
outskirts of our safe zone it's not too
bad you need to go east eventually
nothing good here hello world
all right we're going east we're going
on
ace we're doing the east thing I'm gonna
do some auto run here it's funny because
when I was actually doing some testing
earlier in this game I found that if you
just auto run from one end of the map to
the other you you you at least get in
like the top 20 of gamers but when you
actually try to play the game you die
immediately
like I've been demonstrating okay
there's seriously a guy right over here
I'm gonna hide behind this white picket
fence you'll never see me coming
what the what no no stop it is that
coming from inside the house
you see in here
guys is he in here
oh my god I killed vegan for 2000 I have
to tell my wife she'll be so
disappointed Oh was he with anyone dude
oh there's another guy right there I see
him I see him he's right there he's just
chillin oh oh I see the bastard but does
he see me Oh
get your ass down he's coming in he's
coming he's totally coming
oh shit I'm scared
I'm scared what do i do what do i do
what do i do guys what would you do what
would you do if you were really bad at
this game and someone was going to kill
you okay there's a door here he could
come in through here ooh I can't even
oh my god oh he's - oh my god I'm so bad
he was right there he basically did the
same thing to me that I did to the other
guy oh jeez oh jeez
well can't win them all I guess I got
one I got one kill it's more than I
usually get so yay cheers to that
whoo I feel like a winner no I don't I'm
not gonna kid myself I should have
grenaded oh yes I had no idea where he
was all right here we go
here we go dude that was a that was like
that was like seriously the confidence
boost that I needed as she had one kill
and now I'm down like bloodthirsty I'm
ready to go I'm pooped
you know I gotta use my grenades more
often be more liberal with my grenades
more liberal with my death and
destruction no don't say that
don't say anything about the game
crushing they're gonna jinx it and then
the string will be over and everyone
will be mad at you so everything's going
just fine nothing will crash nothing
will go wrong was the perfectly stable
game it's never had any issues all right
all right
yeah the CPU is white warm to get them
to 75 see this is a fairly CPU intensive
game 78 C so yeah we're almost at an ADC
I think I think instead of just doing
the normal thing that most builders
would do and you know reseeding the CPU
reapplying thermal paste cleaning out
the loop I think I should just do a hot
line 2.0 because let's face it ever
since Paul went went did his Arctic
Panther 2.0 there's been all this
expectation now that I have to revamp
hot line because it's you know totally a
slow and inadequate system but now I
really do want to upgrade her and give
her the special treatment revamp the
whole thing but I don't know if I'm
gonna do it Paul did and use the same
case it's different because he actually
spent a lot of time modifying his actual
case putting in the USB 3.1 type C
header or the front panel connector
and the tempered-glass side panel mod
which is really nice but I didn't really
do much to my define ass it was already
good to go
he used to define our five so it needed
a little bit of help but I may swap out
the case I don't know what do you guys
think maybe maybe define our six or
something or define s2 if that ever
becomes a thing as long as I have as
types the other friend
why hello I was just busy kicking ass in
this game while you were gone
wifey sauce is here by the way people
I'm not talking to myself not as crazy
as you think also how does the audio
sound I'm using my wireless lavalier
which the receiver is piped into a sound
board and that's now connected to hot
line
yay food that's what I use for the
majority of my videos these days first
time I've used it for live-streaming
though so this is an unprecedented first
on the channel honey people are saying
hi to you also I killed the vegan oh
yeah I killed him or it could have been
a girl
I hope yeah either way they what what
did they do to me they tried to kill me
actually they were kind of just camping
out in their house and I I broke in and
killed them which sounds worse than it
really is but you gotta do what you
gotta do you could feed me I guess but I
don't know that sounds messy I can't
imagine that would go well especially on
stream
although I am I'm getting hungry
another crossbow another useless
crossbow much help you were the first
time with be all full auto Thank You
Tucker mother Tucker with the pro tips
what down pro chips yes alright oh
there's a dude there's a dude you guys
see the dude there he is there he is
there he is he's running where is he
he's coming up here isn't he he's coming
up here like a bitch I hear I hear here
Oh No how I thought I oh my god what oh
okay we need the burrito eating burrito
I was so close honey so close you would
have been so proud the guardrail seats
the guardrail oh my god I had to have
have at least damaged him some now I see
why POA I cool now I see why people
wouldn't go full auto with that
particular gun because you unload a clip
in like half a second although that's
not usually a problem if you have decent
name which I currently don't in this
game so this is the hottest right yeah
all right we're going extra hot on the
sauce it's a warm burrito not like a
cold wrap mm-hmm
Oh oh yeah that's right you went to
Rubio's and not the other place mm-hmm
um now you guys get to watch like this
experience where I'm gaming while eating
it's like a combination of game
streaming and and and social eating it's
a new category that I've just invented
unique I probably would never water cool
my ram I don't see much of a use for it
but it's the end to elite build that I'm
planning is definitely going to get a
monoblock for the CPU and of erm
so that's exciting okay I'm not gonna
land on the island this time I'm gonna
try to jump out somewhere a bit more
central
thank you super bails appreciate it yes
welcome to the float lane
it'll land on the fridge well I think I
missed that I missed that I'm jumping in
right now yes
anthrax I am running on my ACR predator
x34 ultra wide display at the moment so
ultra white is great but it kind of
sucks not having a spare monitor when
you're streaming because I kind of to
resize all the windows to get the game
window and right now I've got twitch
twitch chat and xsplit open so I've got
four different windows on screen they
don't really fit all that well I mean
everything is super downsized apart from
the game having a pair monitor would be
ideal in this scenario so here we are I
see guys landing in that compound there
I'm not gonna touch there were some
really tall apartment buildings I'm
gonna head for that because I don't see
anyone that close although there there's
I'm gonna die there definitely okay yep
they're definitely gonna kill me that's
cool there's a guy in that building no
problem and I closed that give me all
your guns ooh yeah honey I was saying
earlier I killed the person on stream
his name was vegan 420 yeah he eats
green things and he smokes green things
oh look at this I got Lani yep and I and
I killed him I killed your kind of guy
what what whoa that's too much it's too
much of a vegan Union vegans are not are
not healthy when they're together no
every vegan should have to marry a
meat-eating carnivore or a carnivore
just to balance out the craziness
okay I've got a revolver don't mess with
me I wish I had something better though
let's go in here
alright I'm actually gonna try to make
it guys I'm gonna try to make it like
and look in the top 20 or something
beyond the first like five minutes of
the round people are just attracted to
me they just keep keep following me why
did I grab that I wanted this give that
frag give me that frag yes I do stream
occasionally very very occasionally
exhibit a I haven't strained in a long
time though just a solo stream playing
some games wait well yep
I could use all of this really give it
to me same goal and I've learned that I
can go to auto like that single or auto
we're doing Auto baby repping that auto
lifestyle surprise I haven't seen the
guy come up yet
interesting I'm gonna have you take a
bite one play okay all right I'm gonna
take a bite well wifey sauce needs me
mm-hmm
that was surprisingly effective Oh was
that a guy no hmm good
oh no no I don't want to open this door
because I'm nine attr bold and
irrelevant I'm just kidding
that's a great gpo oh my god I think
he's always right there guys I saw him
he was right there I'm gonna go out and
know I'm gonna be I'm gonna stay here
they're coming for me I know it
oh shit I got to go Southwest and try
not to die in the process
going around
and I have like hot sauce on my cheek no
all right getting the hell out of here
bro tap right click oh cool
get the down sights thank you very much
for that tip this has been a very
educational stream so far
something's off about the OSD here
because it looks like we're only hitting
13 hundred and 80 megahertz on the core
clock but we're at a hundred percent
usage we should be well over 1,800 I'm
not sure what's going on there memory
clock looks fine and I think earlier
when I said we were getting like 60 to
70 FPS on average I think I was looking
at the CPU temperatures accidentally cuz
we're actually getting closer to 35 45
sometimes they look up to 60 when
there's like lots of lots of sky and
stuff but this is hella demanding game
oh there's a car I see a car he's just
chillin just cruising going about his
business fucker
wonder if I can get him I probably can't
get him from here
but I think the minimum the minimum
specs for this game are totally off it's
something like like three or four
generations ago for the GPU and CPU and
I don't think that's that's probably not
going to cut it unless you're playing
720p medium settings or below oh shit
oh my god
help
Oh somebody hold me
okay now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
run
No
oh no what am i doing get out the gun
load you son of a bitch oh yes I got him
got him oh my god I can't believe I I
can't believe I'm alive I can't believe
I killed him oh alright continuing
Southwest here we go I absolutely don't
take it the wrong way
I take it the right way adorableness is
reign supreme over badass skill okay
I live for adorableness I can't believe
I killed that guy alright run here sure
burrito me up oh no shit
there's a guy somewhere and he's about
to kill me where they oh shit damn it
guess it's not as fun feeding myself I
can't you feed me all the time sorry
guys I failed you
yeah I should have looted him I really
should have he could have had good stuff
alright I'll work that into my gameplay
next time
we're using 12 gigs of RAM right now are
we using 12 gigs of RAM that's gnarly
fortunately hotline has 32 gigs I
upgraded that from 16 about six months
ago or so apparently it's a good idea
that I did single click the aim button
to aim down your sights first-person no
and it's not even OBS I'm using xsplit
which still does not explain that
ridiculous RAM usage
I'm gonna check what's going on here the
game alone is eating about six gigs of
RAM and then everything else just seems
miniscule in comparison
they even got Google Chrome and xsplit
but that's not even a gig combined so
oh no like I said there are some weird
readings with with this version of After
Burner do some investigating later all
right
no never - hold it I'm going in
yeah I mean I didn't realize that pub G
used so much memory even if it's only
six gigs that's that's a lot I mean it
definitely builds a case for ddr4
movement into making sixteen gigabytes
sort of norm for gaming pcs especially
if you're like multitasking like I am
gaming while streaming you got Twitter
and discord open etc yeah you're gonna
need any more than eight gigs man a gigs
is dead all right a nice quiet little
little house and there's not a car
all right helmet acquired it is very
handy I think there should be like a
streaming service you know or a service
for streamers where they just literally
come in and feed you like like uber eats
it can be an extension of goober eats
like uber feeds right goober feeds
there's no way I would have been able to
take that bite just now while picking up
ammunition I haven't really had a chance
to look at the individual colors and
stuff and see which one I like the most
but probably the hottest one I usually
it's the hottest one wait come on
Cooper's beans all right uber feeds I'm
ready for you oh well now you can use f2
my picking you guys hungry I'm sorry I
got to eat man I got to eat how can I
kill people if I'm on an empty stomach
alright that was a car here it's a
working car why yes it is I hate first
person driving this game
all right
today's stream is brought to you by
Rubio's
and why peat sauces hands all part of a
balanced lunch yep
all right
let's go a little bit more central here
cry watching Kyle play
Wow Wow you know what you really hurt my
feelings

this
shotgun - all right so this is exactly
the ideal situation that you wanted to
be in with h1z1 you wanted to have a
heavy assault rifle and shotgun maybe a
grenade or - wifey sauce is still till
this day team h1 / team pub G but I've
been slowly trying to get her on board
and and I have not been very effective
that's okay on these days one of these
days I'll I'll force you into playing
just like a loving husband would do all
right
well I'm just gonna run around and shit
oh there's a guy I see you guys you see
him see you honey
see you
I don't want to go towards him I'm doing
good I don't want to die but it doesn't
look like I really need to go anywhere
right now because I'm pretty much in the
center we haven't had the new safe zone
announced yet so I'm gonna go this way
bitch
what what
Oh med kit med kits yes thank you I'm
gonna go down and do this boom

does it have a flat tire or something
don't forget to change the oil run oh no
I shot at the tire
oh my god
Oh bad well I I am fully aware that
anyone I'm able to actually kill in this
game must suck even more than I do
so there is that level of self-awareness
on my answer let's see am I going okay I
should not drive straight into that city
hope there's a another guy no that's
just a stupid oh my god yep Wow not
having a functional tire really does
wear you down doesn't it oh no I'm being
shot at being shot at keep going keep
going keep going
I'll never get me Oh see that stop bad
that's just just a flesh wound
come on
will never take me alive
come on come on come on come on come on

as long as nobody else has a car that
drives a lot better than this one I can
catch up to me in no time I'm totally go
alright getting out oh jeez jeez Louise
guys jeez Louise I am running away and I
have no bandages or anything to help me
heal so I'm scared I'm scared rip rip

where is he going where is he going
okay you know what no I I don't want to
have anything to do with that I'm gonna
leave fuck that fuck that I just need to
get some frickin bandages you
bandages boy another backpack this is a
better backpack than the one I have oh I
think I didn't think I had a backpack so
yes the answer is yes
12-gauge please and thank you
all right guys I'm gonna go to these
homes out here as long as we're oh you
know what we should be heading east a
little bit ahead a little east a wee bit
east so I'll go back this way well you
know what I have I have time to loot
some of this shit just a tad just a wee
bit of looting that's all I need
look at it's a motorcycle is that
someone else's motorcycle I hope not I'm
gonna take that on my way out of here
level three baby alright Oh looks like
this has been picked have all these been
picked
your your your yolks maybe not this one
maybe baby uh-huh
boots wait what is this who's this
bandages this will help me this is gonna
heal me five of them is that okay so I
just used one who these these don't do
much do they no they're very they're
literally just a bandage putting a
bandaid on the problem I'm familiar with
that that's cool it's cool better than
nothing I'll take it mm-hmm all right
play area is restricting in five seconds
which means I should GTFO as long as
there's nothing good here nope don't
need any that crap all good going back
out no I'm back out this is the way yeah
I came from this direction this is where
the motorcycle was I think so tab key to
load anything use the tab key aim right
click once to go into first person
looking down the scope site if you have
a red dot or holo sight or just the iron
sight you can zoom in okay
I'll see what your anchor in this way
it's easier coming save recoil gotcha
good pro tip as well I'm gonna try that
out
so I'm in the top 35 right now guys 35
left means I just got a kill 34 these
bastards I'll be good
chicken dinner I can smell it and smell
the chicken dinner already
alright I'm gonna go a bit more from
away from all this chaos there's just
too much shit going on I can feel it I
can smell it
it's another motorcycle right there Oh
oh shit I died I died from falling
what the bikes are dangerous this is
good to know you're probably not far off
with that assumption Rob slow oh my gosh
I've never died on a motorcycle before
in this game or an h1 oh well I haven't
given up hope yet let's try this again
let's do it I'll jump it back in man
jumping back into the 4a let's do this
let's do it but I feel like I've already
learned so much about this game from you
guys just in this stream alone and I've
also been applying certain certain
tidbits of information that I learned
from you guys you know weeks ago last
time I played this so let's kill it
let's kill it we're gonna kill it come
on I'm fired up fired up that's what the
what's with the afros what's with this
game and everyone everyone in this
battle royale just suddenly super into
disco I don't understand just let it die
already
okay so when I'm driving straight across
terrain and any vehicle be careful it's
easy to flip yourself you could die as
I've just so loved lovingly Illustrated
okey-dokey
I would be really curious to do an a/b
temp temperature comparison just for
thermals sake of actually just draining
and refilling the loop just to see if
that does anything for temps at almost
ATC that is not acceptable not
acceptable for this loop no siree
they revisit that
okay I'm gonna jump out maybe any pun
all those pills now it looks too obvious
I'm gonna trying to hit one of these
smaller areas ready boom
I'm gonna try to go for this small
neighborhood here it looks mostly
innocuous I'm sure it'll be fine
6950 X yes thank you anthrax overclock
to 4.4 gigahertz I'm sorry I say four
four I meant 4.2 I didn't go quite as
aggressive on this one the more cores I
I tend to feel like I'm happy you're
settling with a slightly lower frequency
for stability purposes heat and power
most importantly alright don't land on
the roof get off stop messing around
so I didn't really look but I didn't see
anybody else landing near me
knock on wood load closing this door I
feel like if I close the door I'll be
able to hear them if they open it you
should be able to set like little traps
and stuff ooh a red dot sight sure why
not anything that helped me increase my
aim anything that'll help
open nothing let's see
proceed to play area okay I'm good
knowing no immediate rush to get the
hell out of Dodge
alright we're just gonna make our rounds
here I'm gonna try to loot as quickly
and efficiently as possible and then
bone the eff out I already have a pistol
don't need any of that a can of gas what
is the can of gas good for can you start
fires can you light people on fire is
that even practical I don't know you
tell me dirty bathtubs everywhere oh
hello hello hello yes yes yes okay yep
yep oh look at that not enough space
take that vest I could use a backpack
right about now I'm gonna have noticed
is that the you don't have nearly as
many storage slots or I should say it's
a lot harder to find backpacks in this
game that it is an h1 if you like
backpacks are everywhere
and here you actually gotta look for so
you'll go first couple minutes of the
round without the means to hold shit
there we go you got to talk about it
enough and it'll just it'll just appear
poor Chuck didn't show the shotgun show
so can I use this can I put the Sun AHA
and that does things it it helps it
helps choke the shotgun I don't know it
worked ok yeah I kind of like this
little uh this little area that I picked
out
does this seems pretty quiet nice place
where people won't bother me and oozy
yeah oh no no I'd much rather have the a
case sorry sorry and then this is just
more easy ammo and shit
9 millimeter by millimeter bullshit I
wish I had more ammo for my aka fiber
does feel a bit limiting those bandages
get my damn bandages no no I should just
do this instead
well I can't how do I get the damn
bandages I don't need that's 7.62 I
don't need any of this shit 9 millimeter
go away
alright I should probably also switch to
shotgun while I'm in a close quarters
area
oh wait what is this first-aid helmet
good good good
oh look at this oh I see switch to mp5
oh no I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with my
shotgun yo I like my shotty I like my
one-pump chump no I'm saying no I'm
sorry bro okay my still in the safe -
yeah I'm good I'm good okay all right
all right
right-click auto fixes - weapon when in
storage tab in stops second for kissing
items table - - exactly see what you
mean like that
already look at that
oh it makes a shotgun have a tighter
pattern oh yeah
well then obviously it's awesome
I don't need any of that no thank you
Oh nope
I didn't I want to pick that up bandages
bandages
we need a coat that's a coat useful oh
well hello is this that's the same shit
that I already have right
you know it's almost a little too quiet
up here now I'm not sure if I like it
the longer I wait here more chances
there are someone coming along and just
really screwing me over
and I'm decked out why wouldn't they
want to screw me over
I've got all the loot all the loot baby
maybe we should the hell out of Dodge
I'm gonna move west to the west side
bong bong 1 2 7 I do not stream very
regularly so don't feel ashamed that you
didn't know that I streamed because I
don't really usually by the way I also
think I killed your friend earlier of
vegan 4/20 sure you and him have some
catching up to do
doot doot doot doot doot doot how the
coat lets you hold more okay dude dude
dude well I should have got the coat but
I didn't so maybe next time so right now
we are headed probably towards the
center of the safe area
it's wait yeah I already
remapped autorun 2x cuz it just did not
make much sense to me to have any useful
key mapped to the equal sign key it's
the same thing I did for h1 all right
new Andy
have a good one man thanks for joining
oh look it's a loop - some addition to
this looks untouched this looks
untouched bandages bandages everywhere
Jeremy oh ok just another stupid door
is this is this nothing nothing
it was just crap in here isn't there can
you tell from looking at a building like
if it's gonna have good shit in it
probably not right
oh hello scar you and I had some good
times in the last round
let's do this wait how do you okay there
you go there you go
beautiful honestly right now I still
feel like I'm much more used to h1
because I've played it so much more but
the more I play pub G the less I hate it
I'll put it that way
I can't deny just how much better it
looks visually from a graphic fidelity
standpoint than h1 but the other thing
is that I haven't really had time to
play this game with other people and I
think if I were to play this with a
large group like I did with h1 back in
the day I would immediately enjoy it
more because I think that's what makes
it so fun there's a sort of a small
ragtag team of of other players that you
get to game with I was always that's
what did it for me who knows maybe one
of these days I'll actually have time to
game and and like not for work like just
just gaming for gaming sake cuz even
this like I'm planning to upload the
rebroadcast on to the YouTube channel
for all the noobs he didn't catch it the
first time I am probably gonna leave
this here I like my scarf it's cool but
now I'm just rambling now I'm just
trying to talk to you guys to keep
myself sane cuz I'm alone in this
apocalyptic map and it scares me
yeah just other other things that I
don't need energy drink what does the
energy drink do is that just help you
stay awake longer
is that so like when you know you're
looting houses and there's no action
going on you don't fall asleep out of
boredom that's I must be what they're
for okay we're gonna go west a little
bit more that was a useless area for
looting
no I did not remap the X key when do you
ever need to like put the weapons away
I've never like need to put a weapon
away I've always needed to take a weapon
out
yes Tucker I shall let you know oh it
gives he'll over time
okay well that's cool so that's good if
you're like caught in the cotton that
electro force field thing that kills you
slowly might be good energy drink time
looks like there's just nothing but
mountains up ahead I'm gonna go right a
little bit and we'll aim for some of
these tinier patches of buildings that
are over here
yes far far from the red zone screw that
screw that
when the circles on your ass you put
weapons away to run faster
I see gotcha so the weapons actually
slow you down that makes sense
well then what if you just switch to
like a pistol do you run any faster with
or without a pistol because I feel like
that wouldn't make much of a difference
in real life anyway
of course this is far from our L look at
that look at that cool-looking structure
ooh I'm gonna go in there it looks like
a gothic Church similar to the h1z1
buildings looks very ominous I will meet
my doom here show them ah all right so
we've got stuff here I don't need any of
this
hmm nothing much oh nothing much let's
see if there's anything upstairs it's
also a nice little vantage point all far
as the eye can see
oh I am bandaged up I'm out of space and
start dropping things oh I got here what
what what would I even drop I really
don't need that pistol
all right let's go down
see what's on this freakin mountain of
rocks
this is cool I like this like sort of
ruins area what that's pretty badass see
guys I told you I've not played this
game enough although it's kind of shit
for looting unless was this first aid
kits I'm just out of space I think I'm
just too decked out right now I have too
much stuff I probably have enough stuff
I have I definitely have more bullets
than I'll even get to use before someone
kills me that's cool that's cool that's
cool that's cool man getting about a
little under 50 FPS right now with our
90 DTI overclocked hello wifey
welcome back I'm in the top 26 it's not
bad right yeah I know
and I'm still in the safe zone wait is
that a guy oh oh I thought that was a
guy holy shit I thought that was a guy
for a second it scared me
what do I do right now what do I do you
guys what do I do
nope Jerry Neutron I don't know why had
my GPU usage says over 100 percent it's
definitely usage and not power so it's
weird I don't know who I MSI is
reporting that and we're using just a
single gtx 980ti right now we have
disabled sli because i was getting some
weird stuttering micro stutter in this
game earlier your GTX 10:50 does better
than 50 FPS well you also have to keep
in mind that we're running ultra
settings we're streaming and recording
locally so all that combined I mean this
is a fairly CPU intensive game to my
knowledge so the fact that we're also
doing some heavily CPU bound tasks could
could mean drop in framerate
get this little weird what does this
frickin Louisiana just nollans pants mmm
pants oh my fingers are getting like
weirdly oddly numb do a red dot sight
what what do I have to draw to get this
thing going
quick draw mag flashhider guys what
should i what should I ditch here I
don't think I need the energy drink
honestly or I guess I'll just I think I
just used it
oops let's see I don't need any nine
millimeter or 5.56 millimeter right oh
no wait
that I do need that for my scar 12-gauge
7.62 though I don't need that
all right click my red dot here we go
boom look at that there's another one
here I couldn't I can't put this one
here
so just ditched that one all right so we
got a red dot here so now if I go like

keep that there
I like that 4x go to X we've got the 4x
I think I'm good guys think I'm good I
think I'm good anything that I might
have left behind I probably don't have
the skill level to actually utilize
properly anyway so should be fine nope I
don't need anything here how are we how
are we doing on oh I need to get to the
