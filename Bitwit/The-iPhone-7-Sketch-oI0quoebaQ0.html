birthday I'm glad you asked honey
actually an iPhone seven would be great
because the antenna lines on the iPhone
6 or pier cancer an iPhone 7 I can't
afford that what am I gonna do
happy birthday hey hey oh my god are you
serious
you seriously got me one no way wait
why is it wrapped in printer paper is so
minimalistic nothing useful over here
this is definitely knife on seven all my
contacts already synced for my old phone
and it comes bent this is amazing
thanks honey anything for you Hey look
they removed the audio jack it's not
cool yeah you like that yeah well I mean
there's a lightning adapter so I can
still use my headphones I just can't
charge my phone at the same time but
like now I get to choose right like do I
want to listen to music or charge my
phone you know before it was just like
do it all you know stupid oh by the way
have you heard the stereo speakers on
this thing they are amazing check it out
yeah - shitty speakers really makes
difference did it did it just die
Wow they've really improved the battery
life but you know what's great is that
they've actually engineered the seven to
be just as functional when it's off
that's a feature and it's waterproof now
so check this out no no I mean remember
the phone that I have this waterproof I
got it two years ago I've already seen
that I can't do this anymore honey the
truth about your iPhone 7 is that it's
exactly the same as the iPhone 6 but
shittier is that it wouldn't be complete
without a pair of wet things seriously
get out these look so
all right be honest how do I look</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
