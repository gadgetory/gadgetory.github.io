at CES 2019 this time from my favorite
suite ever my own that's right we're
here at the Palazzo Hotel this is our
room and I think this might be the first
time I've ever tried to build a system
in a hotel room fortunately the rooms
here at the Palazzo are very spacious
but we have a relatively tiny table so
we'll just have to see how it goes and
what we got but we have a lovely build
in store for you guys today it's gonna
be a gaming centric build hopefully you
guys will enjoy it this video is brought
to you by MSI they've sponsored this
video and thank you to them for making
this happen they've actually provided
the graphics card and the motherboard
and we're gonna go over the parts really
quick in no particular order our video
card is the msi geforce r-tx 2070 duke
this is actually a really great card
that I've had the privilege of working
with in the past just recently for
Chris's build in fact he's been loving
it so far says it's given him no
problems and it's super speedy for all
of his gaming and workstation tasks it's
a great card it's got a triple fan
design they're using their triple
torques 2.0 fans which are incredibly
quiet and effective at dissipating hot
air off of those huge fin stacks it's a
fairly long card but not too girthy so
hopefully we'll be able to mount it
vertically in today's case which is also
very exciting the card also has an
incredibly strong backbone the backplate
is not only sexy as hell
but very reinforced so should hopefully
help eliminate GPU sag and even if it
doesn't if the card comes included with
the GPU sag brace just below that we
have the corsair h 110 i liquid AIO it's
a 280 millimeter radiator and it does a
great job of carrying heat away from our
CPU which will be generating quite a bit
of heat it's a great a o tried-and-true
I've used it many times in the past and
I think it's also gonna look lovely in
today's case moving on we have our SSD
it's our only drive for today no
mechanical storage here it's just a demo
build after all this is the HyperX fury
RGB free standard typical state of EV
360 bit per second drive and a two and a
half inch form factor but very reliable
very speedy four say there were three of
course and it's got that lovely RGB
touch on the front I love the integrated
lighting it's very seamless you don't
see any LED hotspots or anything like
that so looking forward to putting that
in the break today the motherboards from
MSI it's their mpg:0mpg a mning edge AC
it doesn't mean it comes include with
air conditioning ac is of course
referring to wireless AC so it does have
a wireless AC card built right in which
is fantastic gives you that flexibility
when trying to connect to the interwebs
mpg
MPEG stands for most pouty gamer no no
multiple pretty girls
my precious game boy Mary please go
they're getting worse
man pub G okay I actually really like
this board it's got an eight plus four
pin power connector for the CPU
delivering up to five hundred and forty
watts of power so that's actually really
nice the overclocking should be pretty
good on this board as well the BRM heat
sinks are extended at least the one on
the left is you can see that it just
goes up and up and up and over the IO
area it's it's extremely huge it's one
of the bigger vrm heat sinks on the Z
390 platform that I've seen board also
features Intel turbo USB 4 twice the
speed twin turbo M 2 slots giving you
PCIe gen3 by for connectivity up to 32
gigabits per second and the list goes on
there's a ton of connectivity on this
board and it's all blacked out with some
RGB lighting on the side I feel like
there's no more worthy CPU for this
build than the Intel Core i $9.99
hundred K which I have here in a little
clamshell I don't have a retail box for
the CPU because I don't own one this is
actually an engineering sample of course
it's got eight cores 16 threads it's an
absolute beast
very expensive but what do you expect
from the world's fastest gaming CPU for
memory we're actually going to be using
a 16 gigabyte kit of Corsairs Dominator
platinum this is not the new RGB version
that we saw at CES this is the
old-school kit but still very good at
ddr4 3,200 speed kit and it's silver
sort of gray so it's gonna match with a
lot of the other components in this
build just to the right of that we have
B quiets eye power 11 know is it just
says IDE on the boxes being covered up
this is the straight power 11 750 watt
unit it's actually kind of funny that
this is a higher wattage power supply
than the 2970 WX thread Ripper build
that we built earlier this week kind of
backwards there but it's what we had at
the time this is a fantastic unit it's
80 plus gold certified fully modular
very nice black cables and a silent
wingspan built right in for extreme
cooling and silence if you want my
personal opinion on this unit its I know
it's very good our chassis is the very
new fantex eclipse p600 s-said Vantage
was actually showing off at their booth
during this week it's very exciting I
actually stole it from their booth
because I liked it so much they are
still currently trying to find me I
think it's a great looking case
personally of course looks are
subjective but it has the same
functional interior layout
as the evolve X which is a fantastic
case on its own course it looks a little
bit different from the outside I would
say it's even a bit more flexible than
the evolved X in the sense that it has
these modular panels on the top and
front that allow the user to tailor the
system for air flow over silence I also
like the fact that underneath those
panels they're actually using like a
fabric mesh material which is supposed
to allow air to more easily permeate to
giving you higher air flow than a
typical plastic mesh filter I believe
they're gonna offer this case in black
and white as well but you can see I have
the anthracite grey here I love the fact
that they've continued that treatment on
the interior not just the outside of the
case for a more uniform look so those
are all the parts thanks again to MSI
for sponsoring this video if you guys
want to find links to any of this stuff
I'll drop them in the description for
you without further ado let's get
assembling this super sweet build sweet
SUV double meaning double double
entendre their plan words it's not funny
would have to explain it
all right build complete look at it just
look at it it's awesome gray and silver
accents throughout it looks fantastic of
course I have to shout out how fabulous
the graphics card and motherboard from
MSI look as well the P 600 s was a dream
to build in obviously if you're a fan of
de-evolve X then this is gonna be a very
similar experience there were a couple
snags along the way however the side
panel window was a little bit difficult
to get off of these hinges it was kind
of stuck for a little bit we had to sort
of rock it back and forth and until it
finally popped off so for the power
supply we actually have the fan mounted
up at the moment and that was only
because we didn't want to show the ugly
sticker that's on the other side but
it's not a really ideal situation we
just did it for pretty b-roll and stuff
mainly for aesthetics because there's
hardly any clearance between the top of
the power supply and at the top of the
power supply basement so it's getting
little choked there I would much prefer
it to be face down it would have been
nice if they included like a modular
plate that you could put on here to
cover up any ugly stickers or if they
just punched some ventilation holes on
the top of the shroud that would've been
nice too now the case does support
vertical GPU mounting you actually have
three slots here to put the card even
further away from the tempered glass
side panel so it gets a bit more airflow
however we didn't have the appropriate
PCIe riser car that's compatible with
this case so we actually ended up
throwing in last-minute Cable mod
vertical GPU mounting bracket and that
actually puts the card even further back
into the case putting it right in
between the two 140 millimeter fans so
you're actually getting air on both
sides of the card which is exactly where
you want to be apart from that the case
is fantastic a lot of room inside the
case I was actually able to mount the
208 millimetre radiator first and then
route my eight pin EPS cable for our CPU
which can be kind of hard to do in a
case that has limited space inside but
it was no problem here apart from that
cable management was a total breeze
especially when you've got that power
supply shroud there's lots of helpful
velcro straps back there and plenty of
space between the motherboard tray and
the rear side panel to make everything
look tidy overall though I love this
case I love this build I love all the
parts inside the build and you should
too you need to like all the same things
that I like thank you very much again to
MSI for sponsoring this video thanks to
you for watching it again links to all
the stuff in the description tussle like
on the video if you enjoyed it it helps
us a lot get subscribe for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon we will
see you guys next time
next video it's good the hell out of
Vegas I'm sick of this place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
