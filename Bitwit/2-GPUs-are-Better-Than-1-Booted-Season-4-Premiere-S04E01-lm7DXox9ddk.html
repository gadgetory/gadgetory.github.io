booted I'm your host Kyle and you're
watching this on awesomesauce and
network the YouTube channel this is a
show that I do every single Tuesday I
take that back
it's not it's not on Tuesdays at all and
it's not every single anything it's
actually on Mondays the first four
Mondays of every month totally butchered
that one but you can catch it live right
here on awesomesauce Network at 5:30
p.m. Pacific and this is the season four
season premiere so it's the first
episode of the month of course and that
means that we're going to introduce our
first five contestants in eight yet
another high-end season of booted so
these are all rigs in the ballpark range
of $1500 or more and some of them are
quite more in this season and it's gonna
be good it's gonna be good there was a
it was a huge success last season when
we did the high end stuff and you guys
had so many high end submissions that I
just decided to extend the the high end
theme of one more a month for you guys
now before we get into it I did want to
say a couple announcements the first of
which is that there will be no booted
next month and for the month of June
there will be no booted so bear that in
mind the reason why is because I will be
in Taipei for a good portion of the time
for Computex I'll be covering Computex
for those of you who don't know it's
essentially like CES but in Taiwan a big
big trade show for for technology and
I'm actually more excited for Computex
every year than CES because there's a
lot more DIY PC stuff to look at and
it's especially going to be exciting
with potential Pascal release and things
like that so yes but but booted will
continue the month after that would be
July and there will be a whole new theme
it's like they'd be high-end but maybe
something related to or similar
I don't know I'm either thinking custom
water-cooled there maybe mini mini ITX
would be pretty sweet so maybe I'll take
a poll later and find out exactly what I
should do but on with the show we have a
couple sponsors actually we have one
sponsor who is cable mod thank you guys
so much
sponsoring the show cable mod
specifically their wide beam LED strips
these things are pretty awesome they do
come in various varieties you can get
the adhesive version so it's got the
foam the foam adhesive which is super
sticky some of the stickiest that i've
seen that's what she said and we've also
got the the magnetic backing so whether
or not you have a magnetic chassis you
are situated in either way you have a
bunch of colors to choose from also
including a UV and an RGB as well now if
you guys haven't seen it I did do a
video on the the the cable Mod strips
and here's just a quick example just
just at a glance so the the one that you
saw before at the beginning the green
this screen right here this is a bit
Phoenix alchemy 2.0 strip and then boom
it gets super bright and that's that's
actually the the wide beam strip from
cable mod so there's there's there's
BitFenix alright and there's there's
cable mod and the footage in this video
has not been edited whatsoever so just
right off the bat you can tell it's a
cleaner crisper and brighter color
overall a lot more illumination and
that's that's me it's weird to see
myself streaming myself it's weird to
see myself that's weird but yes go ahead
and check them out if you want an idea
of where to purchase them you can either
go to performance pcs dot-com or you can
check the link below in the description
it'll link you're right there to all of
the various options that they have they
have different sizes and lengths and
things like that as well so thank you
very much to the cable mod guys for
making this show possible wouldn't be
wouldn't be here without them so good on
you mates for that now let's let's let's
talk about let's talk about our five
contestants here there is there's
there's actually a few systems in this
episode particularly that feature
multiple GPU setups and that doesn't
necessarily mean I don't want you guys
to think that they necessarily have an
edge over the the systems that don't
have you know SLI or crossfire setups it
really has nothing to do with the amount
of hardware but really just kind of
style points right last season of booted
was a perfect example we had Alex who
who really just he was the winner
basically and he only had a single
graphics card in there nothing fancy was
rockin an s3 for he case from NZXT it
wasn't some you know
over the over-the-top ludicrous setup
but it was just his just his style and
his just the clean the cleanliness of
everything and how everything just
worked really well together and I'm very
proud of you guys for voting for him as
the winner because I you know the last
thing I want this show to be is just
well whoever has the best Hardware wins
and last season proved that that's not
necessarily the case so yeah so thank
you guys for for treating the show with
some dignity and an honesty I do
appreciate it but why don't we go ahead
and look at our first guy who is Ricky
Ricky Ricky and this is the this isn't
the first 600c case we've seen on the
show
however there haven't been many of them
this is a fairly new case first saw this
at CES this year in January it's
completely inverted if you couldn't tell
already you can see right here it's
upside down and you either love it or
you hate it it's one of those things but
it's it's really grown on me the whole
inverted internal layout ever since I
built one ever since I built a 600 see
inside of that case with the VRA TPC and
I think it's just a really clean looking
build here we've got a 6700 K he's got
to know a single gtx 980ti that's the
EVGA the ACX cooler 2.0 and you got a
motherboard yes he does have a
motherboard can confirm an asus z170
deluxe h1 hunt 110 igt so this is a
pretty pretty beefy system so far right
off the bat I can tell cable management
looks really clean you've kind of gone
with like a white and slightly red theme
I mean the only red I really see in the
system is your RAM and that's a 32 gigs
of g.skill ripjaws five ddr4 of course
as we are on skylake but yeah I mean I'm
kind of curious why you didn't go for
like some white Rams that get it again
with the white Rams
just just because everything else is
white and there's no other hint of red
in the system although I think it does
look kind of cool it almost looks like
like a beating heart like looks like my
eyes are completely drawn to that that
region of your case
however it would have been cool if there
was a little bit more red in here but to
each their own cable management again is
really clean let's take a look at the
money shot now this money shot confused
me at first because it's right side up
like the Corsair logo everything is
where it should be but then I realize
well your this is a 600 CE so
technically you've took the picture
upside down or you inverted it or you
flipped your case upside down and then
took the picture right side up but yeah
I guess you know I didn't really specify
how you're supposed to take a money shot
when submitting a inverted layout
chassis however everything looks clean
from this angle to even up close
everything looks super nice and tidy and
you can check you can tell you either
built this recently or you cleaned it
you clean it regularly because the
backplate on that video card looks
spotless not another speck of dust that
I can see with the naked eye anyway
through the lens and yeah I like this
build a lot you've got some white LEDs
as well here's our here's a hint of that
NZXT hue Plus that you've got in there
rockin some white LEDs in the at the
moment and I do like how you replaced
the the stock fans of the 600 C with
those Corsair airflow fans I think that
was a really good call especially you
know slapping some on your radiator as
well this is actually very similar to
the VR ready PC that I belts because I
did the same thing and I used you know
the white trim on the the the fan mounts
there and I think that looks pretty good
here's a shot with the window on and you
get in a little bit flashy with the with
the hue plus I've got some red LEDs now
and I guess that would be the other
thing it's like you have these red LED
I'm sorry these uh these red sticks of
RAM which kind of limits what colors you
can play around with in the hue software
because not every color is going to mesh
well with red obviously it's not color
neutral at all
however however if it was all white then
you could really play around with it
because why it'll just reflect whatever
color your your illuminating it with but
all the same very very clean and and and
what about what about
uh what about that little hint of GPU
sag I mean technically if it's upside
down is it GPU lift I don't know it's
not really that bad actually
so it's not that I've seen much worse
for sure however we need to we need to
make a group to end GPU sag it must be
stopped just pure madness all right
thanks Ricky good build sir next we've
got Devin Devin Devin Devin Devin
I almost didn't choose you as a
contestant simply because you took some
of your pictures in landscape or in
portrait mode which is not allowed
however you just have a really
interesting build here so I couldn't
resist everything else was spot-on about
your submission we've got a 6700 K yet
again with Daisy 170 X gaming 7
motherboard again 32 gigs of g.skill
this is Ripjaws for memory and a pretty
nice SSD configuration there and you
have two gtx 980 matrix's matrix size
let's see let's see ooh
okay so there's some funky stuff going
in here you guys can probably see why I
was drawn to this particular system that
motherboard tray that you're seeing does
not come stock with the cosmos - I can
tell you that for sure I have I have
inspected the case thoroughly before in
years prior and it does not look like
that so this is all custom work you know
the the background and the floor of his
you know that that compartmentalizes his
case that's all
a custom web mesh that he's put in there
and I think it looks pretty nice I mean
I wouldn't say it's my taste it kind of
reminds me of like a like tile in a 70s
bathroom or something but if you like it
that's really all that matters what I
care about is how well how well of a job
you've done adding that to your chassis
and and how clean of a mod this is
regardless of whether I'd like the taste
or not and I think it looks pretty clean
the only thing I would say and we'll get
back to we'll get back to this picture
as well
is so you can see the the panel that you
put right in front of your five and a
quarter inch base I can see some of the
wrapping peeling at the corners it's
kind of just peeling at the corners and
that doesn't look the best I feel like
that's probably the the weak spot here
in this modification of yours and that's
the thing about mods right you you can
really make your system look unique but
since it is something that you're doing
yourself it requires some skill and a
lot of time and patience to to really
make it look not so amateur
however a prett effort of course and
you've got some nice sleeve cables here
that's a very nice knock to a cooler
that you've replaced the Nook to a fans
with some venturi those are 140 of their
their static pressure fans I like that I
like it and really strong with the color
theme here I mean there's just red and
black across the board and white - it's
a red black and white because you've got
white in your your modded background on
the motherboard tray you've also got
white on your motherboard so so that's
nice
and I like that sound card I don't know
why but it's just I like it sticking out
there it's like oh I am wasn't expecting
to see you here that's that's kind of
neat so yeah that's that's maybe a
slightly overkill power supply I don't
know if you need 1200 watts for two 980
s but who knows maybe you're planning on
throwing a third one in there if that
motherboard supports that I don't
remember if it does but yeah altogether
this thing is sick
cosmos - man yep you must have a lot of
desk space cuz this thing is massive I
remember the first time I ever saw this
thing when I was at working at Newegg
and I had never seen the computer case
that huge when it came in I was like did
they put two cases in one box but no
it's just a beast beast of a case but it
looks like you've populated it quite
well and giving it a happy home so good
job on that Devon nicely done next up
we've got gage I hope that's your real
name
I'll be really sad
that's not your real name I'll feel hurt
and lied to and pained with the
knowledge that you're not actually gage
because that's a cool name
so we've got daya a fan Tex and through
pro 4790k to r9 390x --is yeah yeah 16
gigs of ram and look at those cables dan
sex act I kind of like how they're like
your PCIe cables are overlapping sort of
you know there's very used to seeing
them especially in the case like this
with a power supply strap where you can
just wrap them straight down into a
grommet usually seeing them stacked on
top of each other so it just looks like
one continuous cable but you kind of
have them like criss crossing and it
looks cool I like it and I also really
love the colors that you've chosen with
your cables let's get a closer look at
that kind of got like a highlighter
yellow I think that's probably just
yellow I don't know why it reminds me of
a highlighter probably cuz it's the only
real bright color in this in this case
and you've got gray and white and I
think that's a cool that's a cool color
scheme man I like those three colors I
like throwing gray and with like a color
neutral a neutral color and something
kind of bright and vibrant if hot lines
any indication you know it's black gray
and pink really definitely my taste you
know my style the only thing I would say
is that you have this these really loud
cables that look awesome
however that there's no other yellow to
be found in your case in your system and
I just wish that there was something
else in here to draw my eyes to that
that was yellow I don't know maybe if
you could like have spray-painted your
fans or something like that maybe the
fan blades or I don't know I I don't I
don't I don't know anything about
computers but um I don't know I think it
would just have been cool to see a
little bit more to see you run with the
theme the color theme a bit more
then you have but other than that cable
management is on point
got some LEDs in there as well yes yes
this is sexy looks like you've also got
your fans mounted on top of your
radiator so it looks like you're pulling
air through that radiator which is fine
yeah interesting usually you see you see
stuff like that you know in a case like
this where there's lots of ample room
you see the fans mounted in push but you
probably probably got them in pull or
something but that's fine I'm not gonna
dock you any points for that gauge all
right cool
that's all I have to say about that
let's move on to Davey
driver Davy Crockett Davy Jones I can go
all day
see him storm striker was one of my
favorite cases back in the day and
you've got a 35 70 K and a GTX 970 from
Asus it's a Strix Direct see you too I
really like this case and you've done a
really clean job with your cable
management wow this is really clean and
really good photo quality - I wish I
wish all submissions for booted were
this clean beautiful photo quality an
awesome just awesome color scheme I like
how you ripped that sticker off that
that Corsair power supply loved it but
here's as to why you took the fans off
of your hard drive cages because I know
the striker comes with two fans on the
hard drive cages doesn't it so I'm
wondering why you removed those maybe I
don't know maybe you just didn't want to
take up any more fan headers or
something or just you know lower noise
maybe maybe as an acoustics thing but
also really a big fan of the white and
blue color scheme that was the the
scheme I went with for my first ever
build back in the day and I do like that
ETS
cooler as well from enter max Han this
is gonna be tough you guys do you guys
already know who your favorite is so far
cuz I don't I really don't know yet see
what else you got here
oh look at that rear fan that's a killer
fan says dead I think it says dead
silence on it it's not a brand is that
the the name of the model I don't know
I've never seen that fan before but
points you get points for that fan cuz
it's sick sick as hell I think it looks
pretty cool and you know matches all the
right colors and stuff that is a white
LED fan if I believe I used it for the
white belt oh you got two more you got
two more dead silent fans at the front
uh-huh points those are just some wicked
looking fans really cool they look
really sporty you could see this going
in like a Lamborghini or something but I
like it I like it I usually don't like
what loud patterns like that but that's
that's pretty cool and you've got some
blue LEDs in there noise noise noise
noise debut all the word and oh you got
a little you got a card reader it's the
front there I like that
I like I like seeing card readers for
some reason that aren't stock hey thanks
Michael for the donation and how dare
you don't don't read Michael's comment
don't read the green comment it's a
spoiler it's a spoiler alert don't do it
I feel so conflicted right now because
you just donated money to me but you
just potentially spoiled something
beautiful for a lot of people I don't I
don't even know how to feel right now
I'm so yes yes I'm triggered I'm
triggered too but okay Davey you got
skills bro you got skills this is why I
like booted this is why yeah because
this is an older you know we're still in
z77 at this point and yet I could see
this system outperforming all the other
ones that are on skylake with 6700 k's
enough
yeah I know what do you guys think don't
tell me yet keep that to yourselves
alright next we got Michael hoping this
isn't the same Michael who spoiled
everything
Cody man Cody man yes thank you for the
donation and getting rid of the spoiler
by prioritizing your your comment over
his you were doing Lord's work sir
Michael we've got a fan text evolve ATX
a 6700 K Michael again thank you for the
donation
oh you donated a British pound I've I
would pound it with you no I'm just
gonna stop I'm gonna stop right there
back on track Kyle so we've got
de-evolve ATX we've got two gtx 980ti x'
and sli the reference design however it
looks like you've got some white LEDs on
them so you swapped out the green at the
existing green LEDs that come stock on
the reference design of those cards and
you replace them with white ones I
really like that I think that was a good
call it shows dedication hard work
Michael Michael okay so the Michael
who's trolling in chat well he's not
trolling yeah he's trolling a little bit
it's not the same Michael that
apparently he allegedly claims that this
is not his PC which I honestly I have no
clue but anyway I think this is probably
at this current time one of the most
beautiful mid tower cases and air
coolers currently available and seeing
them together like this is just it melts
my heart yeah be quiet make some of the
nicest damn looking air coolers around
and the dark Kruk pro 3 is no exception
absolutely fantastic at first glance you
might think it's passive
oh yeah there's no fan but no there's a
little little fan
a little heatsink gangbanged over here
there is a fan in there you've got some
savage man that those Rams are so savage
got some dims and cable combs get the
cable coals cable trainer 1.0 looking
sharp mang yeah your cables look good
and EVGA sli bridge i actually just got
one maybe a couple months ago loving it
so far and looks really nice with the
rest of your build night looks good
Michael thank you again for the donation
thank you hmm
clean cable management I like that that
850 Evo down there just chillin it's
just a great place to mount an SSD white
fans yep this is sexy sexy as hail man
so many good systems so many good
systems to choose from but as great as
they are four of them will be booted by
the end of this episode and and it's up
to you guys to decide which ones will
will have to leave empty-handed today so
right about now you should be seeing
some links going out in chat and my
trusty my trusty moderators which I
believe where our spider fan and cell
processing if they're in here should be
posting a link in chat right about now
that'll take you to the voting page the
voting page will look something like
this
wait you can't see it the voting page
will look something like this
and then you just vote you're like oh
I'm gonna vote for Devi or I'm gonna
vote for Devon no I'm gonna vote for
wait why are there two Davey's oh god I
totally messed up okay so one is Ricky
even though the numbers are the same I
don't know why I put two Davey's but
don't worry guys one is still one one is
still the 600 see here so the names
the only thing that our that's incorrect
right here but so number four Davi
number one Ricki you guys will figure it
out
just look at the pictures just decide
what your picture you like best not too
difficult oh that's my Twitter page
let's go ahead and really quickly recap
on cable Maude why beans white bean
strips and why they're awesome the wide
beam technology offers over fifty
percent greater than traditional LEDs
fifty percent brighter dual adhesive
options with foam adhesive or magnetic
backing also say to power oh thank God
that these have seen the power I hate
anything with molex these days it's just
a huge pain in the ass I feel like molex
should have gone way of the dinosaur far
long ago and of course they're fully
chainable and compatible with aura
software if you have a compatible AC
some motherboard with a RGB LED header
on it then these will work just fine
with that I have tested it with that as

many qualified submissions did you
receive for this season well for this
season the submission window is pretty
short it was only like two or three days
oh I don't know maybe 40 or 50 hard to
say too many no I really do appreciate
you guys sending in those submissions it
makes the show better because I have
more options to choose from if I only
had like 15 submissions then I would
just have to choose all 15 of them
regardless of how good or bad there
their photo quality was or how awesome
or shitty their systems were so I really
do appreciate you guys sending in those
rigs and stay tuned for a future episode
