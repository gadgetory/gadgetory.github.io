to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info alright
guys I just got back from the NZXT booth
and I was expecting to find like maybe a
new case or two some new fans something
RGB related but no instead I walk in and
they show me a motherboard of all things
yes NZXT has actually made their very
first motherboard which I think no one
saw coming
especially me and but it looks pretty
cool it's the n7 it's the n7 available
in black or white and it's an ATX board
on the Z 370 chipset so it's if you're
not interested in coffee like then this
board does not apply to you there was no
confirmation on whether or not they try
their hand at a name for board later
down the line but I'm sure that sort of
hinges on how well this board does in
the first place so starting off here
we've got an all-metal motherboard cover
made of steel it's actually sort of an
aluminum and steel construction the m2
covers there's two have got two slots on
the board those covers are actually made
of aluminum the rest is made of steel
they're very easy to remove which i
think is gonna be great for for modding
if you want to do some paint jobs with
it it should be very easy to do the the
heatsink plates are actually very easily
easily swappable on the VRM and the
chipset they're actually gonna be
selling cover plates heatsink plates
separately in different colors including
glue glossy blue red or purple if you
wanted to just mix and match and and get
a bit more thematic with the whole thing
the board will support overclocked ddr4
speeds of up to 38 66 megahertz and of
course Intel XMP 2.0 we get a 15 digital
power phase design using Infineon ICS
for clean stable power that's for your
CPU DRAM and your PCH chipset we had
support for 7.1 channel audio with niche
akan gold caps the board supports SLI
and crossfire for multi-gpu setups and
we also get surface mounted power and
reset buttons with a debug led in a very
odd location underneath the bottom m2
slot cover so you actually have to
remove that in order to see it and it's
also sort of close to the PCIe slot
above it I should also mention that
there are two full sized by 16 PCIe
slots on the board
but moving on here we have no what looks
looks to be no USB 3.1 gen2 header which
I found a little disappointing there's
also no point or port I should say on
the back rear i/o so I thought that was
a little odd considering the price point
which we're gonna get to in a moment
what sets this board apart really is the
fact that it integrates seamlessly with
cam hue + and grid + actually both those
modules module 2 I can't words are built
straight onto the board for seamless
support so you can control everything
via canvas all of your RGB lighting your
your your cooling your fans etc as you
have to lighting channels for for hue +
and 6 independent fan channels for the
grid + so that's actually pretty cool
the kicker here is the MSRP which is 5
no I'm not 5 $300 that's still pretty
steep $2.99 is quite a bit more than the
market price I feel for a board with
these features however if you are set
and sold on NZXT ecosystem then this
might be the board for you because it
does make it a lot easier and simpler
just to have everything natively built
into the board you guys let me know what
you think though in the comments below
of the price of the aesthetics the whole
thing very curious to hear you guys's
thoughts as always what are you doing go
away I'm trying to work here you girls
in your your duck face you're fired
moving on we also saw verdaguer there at
the NZXT Suites they were sweet buddies
mainly because they were showing off
their RGB chair that is cam supported so
it actually sinks with pretty much any
cam supported component or device which
is pretty cool they actually had a
couple different models there they had
one with more standard lighting that was
not addressable the other one had dozens
of addressable LEDs in it both of them
looked fantastic
of course you can do a bit more with the
the effects with the addressable LEDs
are you serious right now I hate you I
know a couple of the chairs they had on
display are actually a part of their
existing product stack so you could buy
those chairs now they just won't have
RGB elements in them they were
potentially talking about making those
RGB housing units as sort of an upgrade
kit that would be sold separately if you
wanted to upgrade your existing Brita
gear chair later down the line let's say
you want some added Flair then you can
go ahead and pick those up they did
discuss pricing a little bit but nothing
was
super confirm so I'm gonna leave that
out for now you guys can just go ahead
and speculate or maybe let me know what
you think is a fair price for this stuff
down in the comments on the the LED
lighting there's some LED lighting and
avert agir logo that's casted beneath
the wheel base which looks very cool
just add sort of a nice premium touch
very nice attention to detail there now
they did have one prototype there that
was fully decked out and while it's
still in development they are reporting
24 hours of battery life with one
possible solution that's not finalized
yet but that's sort of an idea of where
they're at right now the battery could
be removed from the back actually it's
sort of like modular could be removed
from the back of the chair and swapped
out for a fresh one if you had an extra
one I'm not exactly sure if we'll sell
that sell those separately I would I
would have to imagine that that would be
a good idea um or it could be charged
while still in use while still you know
installed into the chair with a magnetic
charging cable this is similar to what
we've seen on a lot of Mac books so that
you don't accidentally yank the the the
cable and damage one of the ports or
something like that which of course with
a moving chair which is very heavy
object I think that's a really great
implementation so this is definitely a
must for any over-the-top mancave
especially if you're going to be using
the cam software and integrating
seamlessly with that pricing again to be
determined but coming later this year so
those are all the things from the NZXT
and vertigo suites here at CES 2018 guys
let me know what you think as always in
the comments toss me a like if you
enjoyed the video subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you really soon
from CES 2018 and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
