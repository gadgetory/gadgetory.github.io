to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
is super exciting because I finally get
to show you guys the new studio yes the
long-awaited studio tour is finally here
this is the new office building
basically that wifey sauce and I moved
into not the entire building we only
rented out three mini Suites but it's
very exciting still for us and we're
super stoked to show it off to you today
we're actually standing in the middle of
the first suite this is the smallest
it's almost closet sized of a suite too
like walk-in closet this is where all
the storage for all of our hardware gets
put everything that's incoming that
we're not currently working on gets
stored onto these shelves and awaits its
destiny we've got everything organized
from CPUs motherboards graphics cards
power supplies etc even cases we have
tons of cases but look at this we still
have plenty of room like there's still
tons of ceiling space hey hey stop that
you know stop bringing that in oh
there's just no now we don't have any
more room yeah ok but still I was just
showing people how much room we had and
then you gotta just ruin everything Wow
Wow this is where you belong goodbye
just kidding honey let's move on to the
next room though the next room is a bit
more exciting this is the the
workstation or I should say the workshop
room which is pretty cool we'll start
with the most workshop II area first
which is the build table this is where
all the PC building gets done right on
this table
wifey sauce is gonna demonstrate the
amazing uplift desk that we recently
bought yeah look at that
no do not so again this is where all the
buildings gonna happen it's it's nice to
have a dedicated spot for that a lot of
junk in the background don't mind all
these boxes and in other cases and stuff
that will be dealt with accordingly but
we've got a bunch of film gear here as
well this is where the lighting kits go
and the camera stuff tripods of course
it's kind of a tripod graveyard down
there right now slider but yeah we
actually have a nice spot for that this
is a shower curtain actually that's
resting on a c-stand this is what Chris
our new interns set up recently just to
diffuse some of the lighting that he
blasts through that thing just to sort
of soften things up all you all you've
camera nerds will know exactly what I'm
talking about here we've got sort of a
more traditional gaming setup and this
is actually the backdrop for most of our
videos now because it's colorful and it
adds some character to the shots and it
just looks really cool overall included
in the setup we've got the RGB build
that was PC of the month for either
November or December of last year but
again just all the colors and stuff look
really nice in the background we've got
some awesome peripherals here including
a Corsair k95 RGB platinum I really love
this keyboard not only does it look
really good but it has a volume wheel
which I love and tons of macro keys more
than enough for my needs we've got a G
602 this mouse kind of just floats
around wherever I need it I take it home
all the time or I'll bring it to Paul's
house for awesome Hardware I'll probably
be replacing it soon with something more
wired with a little bit less light and
see even though it is fantastic hold on
let me start and click off of that leave
these monitors though these monitors
holy crap I've been teasing these for a
while now these are the ACS PG three
four eights you guys are probably
familiar with these by now these are
some of the best gaming monitors you can
buy on the market currently we're talkin
34 inch 40 34 40 by 1440 IPS curved
ultra wide with chasing support up to a
hundred Hertz and we have two of them
side-by-side Mugler of go these things
are so beautiful I just I love I love
every inch of them every inch of them in
the most non-sexual way we also might be
using this setup for streaming from time
to time so it's nice to have the little
mic setup here that I put up recently
and yeah it's it's a nice little area
this is the awesome hardware section
this is the awesome hardware table the
paul and i say that with the
with the monitor that Paul is always
looking at here you guys get to see the
front of the monitor this time instead
of always looking at the back side but
it's a very nice 4k BenQ panel the exact
model number escapes me at the moment
Corsair peripherals as well we've got an
older generation k7 t it's a little bit
rusty but it's still working just fine
and one of their newer Scimitar pro RGB
mice this thing is awesome actually
super comfortable very tactile clicks
all around and tons of buttons if you're
into like MOBAs and that sort of thing
but we pretty much just use it for or we
plan to use it for like seeing switching
and stuff in xsplit whenever we are
streaming so that's super cool we've got
the streaming system as well here it's
exactly the same as when we were at my
grandparents place I really need to
upgrade it I think it's still rocking a
core i5 we should really get some hyper
threading in there stat but this is my
favorite part perhaps of the entire
studio setup wifey sauce with the assist
so yeah we've got on pretty much
everything we need for for building for
custom water cooling for camera filming
shooting stuff cables leaving LED
stripping this is a very organized a
little setup here and it saved us a lot
of time just when we need to dig thanks
to her label maker wifey sauce is very
proud of that having everything labeled
definitely saves time when we were
trying to dig out something but yeah
pretty cool let's move on to our last
room here do you do Hey no shoes on the
couch
so here the desks here the desks one for
each employee so this is wifey sauce his
desk we'll go over her desk first she we
actually all sit in the same chair the
same amazing verdaguer trigger 350 Berta
gear really hooked it up we only
approach them when we were looking for
chairs for the office because our butts
refuse to sit in anything else they are
just extremely comfortable we use them
at home and now we get to use them here
they're awesome and we've also got some
amazing monitors once again from the
folks over at Asus these are their pro
art 3 to 9 Q's these things are
absolutely gorgeous tans on them
I think Asus makes some of the best
stands in the biz but these are great
for video editing of course wife the
sauce doesn't do much of that but Chris
and I do apart from just being a massive
32 inch 4k IPS display we're also
getting some great color correction
features like 100
sent rec.709 and 99.5% Adobe RGB plus
you've got some USB pass-through on the
side USB press these are just amazing
panels all around guys I'll put links by
the way to all the stuff in the
description below in case you're
interested more k95 RGB Platinum's the
wrist rest is awesome and i've actually
you know i've never used it in the past
because my desk at home was so small but
now that we have these like fairly large
ikea desks i have room to use the wrist
rest and I didn't realize how
comfortable it was so that's that's
pretty cool but yeah k95 RGB Platinum's
for everyone it's like freaking Oprah up
and is bitch your mouse let's see you
got the glaive you have the same mouse
as I do at my desk this is the RGB Glade
or glaive RGB from corsair rather it's a
very nice mouse actually fairly
attractive and it's got some nice
tactile tactile buttons for front and
back very simple exactly what I need it
for and it's super comfortable yeah
wifey sauce I can't I can't ignore the
the bill that she's using the men to
build featuring a 6700 K and the GT X
1080 fully custom water-cooled Baiul is
truly that systems working out for you
honey
okay you're damn right it is over here
at Chris's desk oh I should also mention
that we each have a corsair void Pro RGB
wireless headsets right underneath our
desks so that if we ever have to hop on
a conference call or you know you want
to listen to music or something while
you're working for the record the void
pros are actually super comfortable and
incredibly lightweight so very happy to
be using those as well Chris pretty much
has a similar setup with monitor and
keyboard and headset but he does have of
course their m65 Pro RGB Mouse which has
this nice little sniper button and
wonderfully ever he uses a sniper button
for anything
probably not but nice to have anyway
beautiful Mouse and then this is not to
be confused with the the mesh if I see
build that we built on the yacht
recently with Michael Josh I would not
do that to Chris this is instead is the
system that wifey sauce and I put
together on a live stream the day that
be mesh if I see launch so we're
actually rockin the pre high-end sky
like X system here with a 78 20 X and
GTX 1084
EVGA boom-boom-boom kind of hard to see
there but you can go ahead and check the
video out if you haven't yet as for my
system well I got so wrapped up in
building and setting up everybody else's
desk that I completely forgot or did not
have time to set up a computer of my own
so I actually do not have a connected PC
right now for my desk setup which is
unfortunate I've been editing all the
videos at home on Hotline but I might
bring hot line over here I kind of need
an editing system at home too so I might
just build a new system and put it right
there on top of that file cabinet but
that is the business end of things and
this is sort of the more fun relaxed
living-room environment we wanted to
have sort of a living room space because
occasionally we'll do something like a
TV video or what does it like to do PC
gaming on the big screen etc and so now
we have a place to film all that type of
content this is actually the lg nano
cell TV that we did a video on recently
you can check that out if you want and
this is the high end htpc that we
recently built that should be at home
this is a meant for home use but we
needed it to shoot the LG video so here
it is and it just looks so nice it just
looks so nice on this amazing
mid-century modern their entertainment
center that I don't want to take it home
we're never taking at home it's staying
here forever yep too bad and wifey sauce
picked out the the very lovely couch
that we have here super comfortable so a
little little love cedar and this is a
max nanak racing chair that I've had for
a while now super comfortable as well
but it's just a placeholder will be
swapping that out for an actual you know
legitimates living room chair and
finally we've got a little dresser over
here that we've got some storage and you
know cleaning supplies water we're all
very well hydrated here at bit wit and
we got some Scotch as well we're also
very well dehydrated here at the company
yoked
you guys remember yoked remember from
from good ol Newegg this is the last
remaining can of yoked yes new leg at
one point did make an energy drink
called yoked which is what we later
called our tech news show at the time
very nostalgic and I believe this is a
digital
kettle that that wifey saw spot that I
have never used I don't think she's ever
used it either
in electric whatever electric kettle
sorry but there it is guys holy moly
again a huge work-in-progress we are
nowhere close to being done we still
want to put stuff on these walls these
super-huge blank walls let us know what
kind of like you know if you think
artwork or or like you know video game
posters what have you you guys have any
ideas on how to spice this place up let
us know in the comments below but holy
crap I am so thrilled that I finally got
to show you guys around I know you I
know you've seen bits and pieces of it
in some of the other videos that we've
done recently but it's nice to just sort
of show it all to you at once to give

stitched together and where we're
