says they're waiting that's so much
pressure well they're not waiting
anymore we're streaming oh good well
YouTube needs to update their shit right
now buddy
what are you waiting dyno it here I got
a refresh now asshole all right yes hi
YouTube
wow we are streaming 23 minutes early
from my designated stream time which was
7 p.m. when does that ever happen I
don't know we are early it happens when
when I have limited you have a short
show I have a little bit of time to plan
my half of the show yeah and end up with
the you know well I didn't have much
time to play in mine either so it's also
gonna be a short half it was really
efficiency that's what it came down to
was just you know proceeding from point
to point right you know obviously
there's a deluge of information that you
get when you're watching awesome
hardware which you want to absorb and we
don't want to like force feed it to you
too quickly yeah but I think we found
the exact right you know level of
information disbursements and first half
of the show that's all that's all I'm
saying I thought you're going to say
information ejaculation now we just we
take the information and you just gotta
insert it and just forcefully repeatedly
like forcefully yeah whoa whoa whoa
buddy like who are you to stick your
information wherever you want forcefully
not forcibly Kyle there is a difference
okay well as long as they're consenting
and I guess they wouldn't be here now
like the difference between discrete and
discrete which is which which which that
reveal was not very discreet in a moment
as it was in front of a global live
audience wait why did I bring that up
again let's let's change the subject
hey by step hey Ally thanks everyone for
watching this is awesome hardware
episode
one hundred and fifty one hundred we've
done a hundred and fifty episodes
sesquicentennial holy sesquicentennial
what he said that's that's a great word
um holy crap one of those stupid words I
know I know what discreet means I'm
gonna ask with some English I'm gonna
create a new segment called words Paul
knows my favorite my favorite studied
word that I know that most people don't
is callipygian callipygian callipygian
it sounds like it has something to do
with the pigeon there's a Y in there
callipygian callipygian callipygian look
it up is that a noun that's an adjective
adjective you and your callipygian
causing a racket tonight I showed you
this before okay but is the most
sophisticated way to compliment yeah
exactly
everyone look it up see al Li Pyg I am
okay what a
callipygian on that and now you have
learned something today you're welcome
I'll take that to my deathbed thank you
very much Paul um alright so this is a
tech live show tech news show where Paul
and I like to stream every single
Tuesday five times everyone in chat says
that you've labeled this episode 148 did
you not update the title it would not
let me edit remember on Twitter I tried
have been logging out and logging back
in I looked for alternative ways to
update the Edit section and for whatever
reason I edit twitch on Twitch I click
edit and it doesn't do anything it just
it's not responsive and I tried all
sorts of things so weird on twitch but
it's actually 150 to be real so yes this
is a tech live show a tech news show I
should say that Paul and I stream to
twitch and our respective YouTube
channels in two halves every single
Tuesday at 5:30 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time
and this week we streamed to paws
YouTube channel first so if you haven't
seen side a go ahead and check it out in
the link in my video description or you
can go to the video unlisted
it shouldn't be our people trolling us
wait wait
let's stay here yeah it says unlisted oh
hey I've got a mighty yeah so pretty
much anyone who's in chat right now
probably just saw it from the tweet
which is awesome thank you chat yeah or
they got it from your link in your from
my link oh yeah sweet all right it's
probably out thank you very much shet
yep for one guys are freaking ace
alright so you're just mentioning how
we've done this 150 times before and how
we're really good at it I never said we
were really good at was employers
because I don't like wine but we tend to
have a few drinks on the show here so if
you are of legal drinking age or if you
just want to drink some water or juice
along with us then cheers to all of you
at home yeah juice is Ghandour wherever
you might be
we also occasionally swear on this show
so if you have sensitive hearing little
ones around make sure to take that into
account adult language morning yeah yep
explicit taste example tasteful adult
language yeah we only use swear words
when we deem it very necessary it's like
one of those adult novels where it's
like they're describing sexual
intercourse exactly but they use such
flowery language yes I'm not even sure
why I have an erection right now right
so this is this good you know we're only
gonna say these words it's a very that's
actually a very good description of this
show that is beautiful
I start talking about you know net
neutrality or Comcast Comcast and you
know no holds barred all right um let's
talk about our stores that we sell
things in our online stores - bit wit
tech slash store I still have the rip
game pad shirt I really need to get one
of these in and start wearing it because
I not seen it in person yet and I feel
like John just just does such a great
job with screen printing
that's something animated like this
would look terrific very much like the
CPU cooler shirt so I'll get one of
those in soon bottle openers glasses
pints pint glasses mugs hoodies all the
works so um go ahead and check that out
you can also hit up Paul's store Paul's
hardware net where he's also got tons of
stuff like the oxblood t-shirt he's got
English pub glasses butcher 20-ounce
Phil I just love that picture all the
foam just I've always liked appreciated
the foam and all that
just an action show over 50 motion blur
going it really is yeah it's captivating
oxblood oxblood thumbscrew also for
anyone who's interested in the this this
reflective thumbscrews shirt on the dark
grey zone this is going this is only
available for a limited time they these
are go and add a stock soon so get them
while they last you mall they last okay
so um those are those are our stores I
we highly suggest that you buy something
from them we will give you a loud
Johnson at the end of the show to show
our appreciation and thanks and all
proceeds go to us as usual would you
like to add no no going back to here
your lien Lee the the family gets moving
it moved I told you it's a shit fan I
don't know why someone left it in the
hallway oh yeah this is someone will
take some sucker I'll take you can just
turn on oscillate hold on how's that
whatever it's got this really loose sort
of neck okay that doesn't really
yes see the issue here is that after
five o'clock six after six o'clock the
AC turns off in this building and since
we're on an upper floor like although
all the warmth and and heat of all the
people working fervently yeah tirelessly
Albay it just filters up here and we're
facing west of a Sun oh yeah trying to
fortunately I feel like the curtains
that the blackout curtains we have here
does help yeah actually it does it would
be even worse right now keep some of
that heat out and it also keeps
reflections off of Paul's face like we
saw in some of the first episodes we
shot here before we had those curtains
up so you know we're working on it
progress everyday progress every day all
right let's jump into our first segment
we've got a lot to cover here let's
start off with bump you see we're gonna
start off with to my pc where you guys
have submitted pictures of your rigs
along with a list of specs so that we
can kind of help you along tell us or
tell you guys from our expert eyes what
you should do to make your systems in
tip-top shape
so first off we've got one from GI Joe
guessing his name is Joe
that'd be pretty sweet if his name was
Joe American Hero a real American hero
who has an ex 79 Asus Rampage six
extreme or six gene micro ATX
motherboard with a 3930k at four
gigahertz ddr3 Kingston HyperX beast 32
gigs of that 2400 a gigabyte GTX 1080i
founders Edition in sli and cool in that
3930k with a Corsair H 105 Corsair
obsidian 350 d and be quiet
pure wings to fans okay okay do you
remember what build we did with the
rampage for gene back in the day mmm I'm
sure you do the rampage for gene
micro-atx x79 motherboard it was some
thumb attic system at Newegg it was a
new egg who brought it to Boston monitor
got destroyed
oh the handle II wasn't the hint I was
the handler wait the handler was Micro
eight yeah yeah it wasn't Mini ITX nose
Micro what case it was a handler case I
don't even remember what wait brand that
case was I thought the handler was a
Silverstone case yeah I think it was I
think you're right Silverstone what the
handle I thought that was Micro really
yeah no yes do they make did Silverstone
I mean there was no money mini ITX x79
motherboard well I know that but the
Silverstone Silverstone we're getting
slightly a case with a handle no this is
on topic now this is the new topic worse
they don't this one new one yeah that
one this is micro ATX yeah a Sugo SG 0 4
Wow I don't know why I always thought
this was mini ITX right yeah you're
right my crazy ex yeah holy shit
Silverstone Sugo SG 0 I guess it was
just such a portable case for micro even
that it's a but yeah that thing was
built like a tank um didn't have the
greatest air flow at the front but at
least is it have a side side panel mesh
well look I found the new ITV video
where we Hey look there's me you
actually review the cases well no wonder
you remember the case better than I did
you reviewed it cuz we were up the
system in it - oh look remember the fire
the firey
oh my god I don't much a little
distracted holy shit and look at look at
like just the set quality Newegg TV in
the early stage I mean we had a white
wall I mean it was white what more could
you ask for everything inside was all
silver like if it was all painted black
internally I wouldn't know anymore
oh yeah it had the
our supply minute on the side that was
always kind of a peeve yeah but I mean
it was it was it was a decent like that
the handle though like I've never had so
case with a beefier handle big ass the
coolermaster striker comes pretty close
hold on I got a striker and trooper oh
look its new egg now we should watch an
episode of a new egg now hold on I'm
pulling up our handler video all right
here it is like two hours epic mobile
video editing it's 12 minutes 12 minutes
oh let's just watch the whole thing that
really makes my job easy for for hosting
this half so 3930k i'm tying this back
go wipe to bring this back to the 3930k
right it's very similar on page 4 gene
alright Silverstone's to go look I even
had all the new egg item numbers Wow and
n 578 GT eggs oh yeah GTX 570 from MSI
where is it this is the test I did we
have a blu-ray burner in there did we
really need a blu-ray burner this isn't
even the build this is the this is the
father of the part to do put the part
one in though this is the follow-up in
benchmarks I don't think we put build
video there yeah good job whoever it was
doing descriptions at the time all right
there's look at you looking all yeah all
the parts yeah doesn't 12 holy shit this
was six years ago we had an optical
drive in there whoa wait you were you
were how will you know what what a very
young Kyle okay at all I'm just
wondering if you were my age at this
point I can tell you in my age twenty
twelve is 32 okay
damn your old sorry in March 2012 I was
31 yeah I know your oldest shit just a
build you're like do you know like
basically dust2 that look at that board
okay gene your half isn't gonna go long
at all if we just completely ignore
everything you have planned and go over
I don't I don't think I remember this
now I had that we had to do some some
body modding to get the the cooler to
fit in the front because we had a 240
millimeter cooler oh that's right yeah
and those those driving damn jerseys
oh the Intermatic splat fly to max I was
a good unit it's a high end power supply
those cables though it's their final
shot did we do a final shot of like the
finish bill out it's crazy like on a
high end unit like that you'd never see
ketchup and mustard cables seen it looks
so opening until you mount the power
supply yeah
takes up like all the space yeah today
that would have a AIO situation this is
a good system yeah so we built this
system we brought it to Boston
so do packets do pack seats cover East
coverage it worked great but we had to
bring a monitor to go along with it yeah
on the way there we had the monitor in a
checked bag not a check that a carry-on
bag so we put it in overhead and we
could handle it the whole time on the
way back I wasn't there but I guess they
forced the the team to check it the bag
with the monitor so I put it in their
hands
and then when it got back it had been
smashed on the corner and it's totally
fucked
so this is why like I kind of fell out
of love with these portable pcs that
you're gonna bring to events to do
there's the monitor because of the
monitor again and then you realize like
well you can really get a lot of the
same you know it's same position in
power I laugh a laptop is money more
practical for this for that type of
thing
name it but I feel like this is funner
it is funny the handler alright that was
a side to quote to quote Jay's two cents
but we defer a big time all right you
guys didn't seem to mind though
so the idea let's move it back to the
first that's okay I don't like I was
planning to have a really short half
anyway that's fine GI Joe though what do
we got here um alright the asus rog
logos on the front look Jo Jo has a
optical drive - he sure does
it's just which doesn't match from the
inside of his case so one thing about up
most optical drives these days or older
ones anyway so they have that sort of
beige or white body that doesn't look
good in a case like this Joe I gotta be
100% honest with you right here
you have to 1080 T eyes in SLI on a
3930k which I feel like might be
limiting the performances of 1080p is to
some degree 1080i is also are selling
for like 900 bucks right now maybe I
don't know if they're still doing that
but they were very expensive I almost
feel like you should sell one of your
1080 T eyes and upgrade your core system
platform X 79 and a 3930k it's still a
solid setup but there's a there's a
decent jump huge bottom and performance
that you can get with a more current
modern stuff that said that said I like
your setup I like I like what you've
done with the build here yeah you got a
lot of cabling going on but there's a
lot going on in the build that could
probably be tidied up just a bit here
and there
tie back a little bit more but for the
most part it's not looking too bad no
you also have a case that doesn't have a
power supply shroud down here so you see
a little bit more the cables going on I
also think you got a you got a very
clean red and black theme going on for
the most part but then with everything
on you've got the green GeForce GTX
logos standing out on the side which I'd
rather just unplugged the LEDs
altogether it doesn't blend quite as
well thank you for the full set up chat
though why do you have a fan grill on
one of your internal like your rear fan
on the inside oh yeah
I mean was it interfering with the
tubing that much possibly yeah maybe the
block keeps the tubing from running into
the fan I guess yeah or it might just be
an anesthetic thing could be but cable
management looks pretty good obviously
you can clean things up to the right of
your motherboard tray where you can sort
of see like above the drive cage as you
can see your SATA cables hanging down
and stuff from various drives which
doesn't look all that clean so maybe
like clean that area up a bit if you
wanted to throw some like red and black
sleeved extensions obviously that would
definitely help things along
um not really much you can do about like
spacing out your your GPUs I feel like
that bottom cards resting up really
close obviously to the top one might
make it a little hot
maybe GPU boost doesn't go up as high I
appreciate the gigabyte founders edition
1080 is that they stuck the gigabyte
sticker on oh it's totally that that's
all gigabyte man should have just
plastered it right on the geforce logo
but looks really good though GI Joe yes
nice system very clean moving on Vincent
Vincent with a core i5 7600 K MSI Z 270
m3 GT x 1050 TI 8 gigs of Corsair Ram
need to get rid of mismatched fans and
the ketchup and mustard I like I like
when they like do our job for us he's
already aware start critiquing their own
dough before we can say it so Wow with
the lights off what even mismatched fans
stand out even more
he's got purple LEDs around the case but
then he's got red and blue and non non
LED fans in the in the system so yeah
definitely you get that sorted out I'd
go with red just go with red because
your your most expensive fans in this
system are red so you don't want to get
rid of those you want to conform to
those yeah and also your RAM is already
rent so that's another thing ditch that
$2 blue LED fan at the top replace that
$5 grey fan at the top with some more of
those red LED fans of the same kind
model and if I'm being a hundred percent
honest here though this is 8 gigs of ram
before you do anything on the aesthetics
of this just nothing I would I would I
would add more memory definitely but
assuming that's taken care of then the
aesthetics can be can be addressed
so yeah ketchup and mustard the thing
here is like a stew addressing the
ketchup and mustard issue is really
gonna require I think a new power supply
because you could get extensions but
you're still going to have this power
supply down here which
ketchup and mustard showing through the
cabling and stuff like that the EVGA 500
B is a perfectly adequate power supply
don't get me wrong but if the set is
your concern swapping that out entirely
might be a better choice than going with
cable extensions because he for nice
cable extensions you'll pay just as much
or more as you would pay for like a
decent 60 $70 mid-range power supply
with all black cabling we're gonna you
know a modern case with the power supply
basement for like 70 bucks that's also
applicant XP 400 eclipse or something
and that alone would make the system
look a lot better but you have you have
some pretty nice hardware in here so
it's got plenty of potential and thank
you for the multiple angles yes thanks
Vincent back back 729 with the r7 1800 X
build a gigabyte or SX 370 gaming 5
motherboard power colored Vegas 64 a
Vegas 64 really a Vegas 64 in a system
that was not aware that that was
actually a thing well I mean what are
these interesting you can get them as
you're willing to pay top dollar are
these film pieces but the fact that it's
in one of these what cases the case does
not look pretty at all some high-end
hardware in a really janky case I'm very
curious it's going on with these foam
panels it either looks like foam panels
or like a dust like a fan was there and
this is like like if this was a dust
buildup that would be gross no that's
not it's totally perfectly square yeah
well maybe he's trying to do some
acoustic insulation or I don't know why
it would be there maybe it maybe there's
rattling or something and he was trying
to kill the rattling I'm not sure I'm
very I have so many questions so the
case obviously has no cable look there's
more foam in the top right this is this
fellow up here he's trying to make his
own yeah I'm DIY I wipe sound insulation
yeah why yeah
Sam damping material wherever all right
so sure I mean it doesn't look great but
if acoustics are that important to you
and it's making too much noise maybe get
a case that has better acoustics to
begin with they have cases now that come
with sound tempting materials maybe look
into that and also a case while you're
at it that has good cable management
because this one there's like virtually
no space behind your motherboard to
reroute cables even even with a modular
power supply like that dark power Pro
you you're still just it looks really
sloppy
I think aesthetically this is a big air
cooler which I'm totally down with the
freezer extreme logo and everything on
this I think looks tacky friendís tacky
and bad yeah I don't know if there's any
way to remove that or paint over it
honestly you just like this buy out this
is the probably the number one system I
feel like we've seen that just needs a
new case yes lighting time like you've
got some pretty good hardware in here
get a new case yeah if your new case has
a dust filter for the power supply on
the bottom then then with a space your
fan down on the power supply that's a
good power supply to the dark power Pro
15 nothing's great yeah all right
yeah I get a case with a basement too so
you don't cover the hideous cables of
that power supply the only bad thing
about it yep next up is Pat Johnson
Johnson 780 700 K overclocked faggy my
man Johnson or a/c 370 gaming seven
motherboard 32 gigs of course our
vengeance LED memory RG Strix GTX 980 d
cool captain RGB all-in-one cooler of
course Sara HD 120 fans terabyte crucial
SSD to 500 gig crucial SSDs be quiet
pure basics under case need a shroud for
the basement
any suggestions this is your your core
components here our high-end enough to
warrant getting a new case yeah
and completely redoing cable management
because the it could be improved
and maybe a case with better airflow
because that you know it's a it's a big
lat pure bass 600 have you worked with
that case before it is very limited at
intake okay has very limited intake air
flow as reviewed by gamers Nexus from
what I can remember okay so that could
be an issue you should check your temps
to make sure that under load you're
doing all right especially with the with
the car and I'm sure your yourse well
know the CPU too if you've overclocked
that 8700 K it's one of the hottest
running chips out there but a new case
would do you wonders both for
performance in terms of air flow and
aesthetics if you had a power supply
basement to cover up that thermal tape
power supply and also just like you know
the key moment you want to cover up the
thermal take God has RGB lighting I know
but it also doesn't look that great when
you can't have any way to hide those
front panel connectors that are going to
your HD audio to your you know your
front panel your USB they look just kind
of like entrails hanging out and there's
just just nothing that can be done
there's really not much that can be done
about those cables unless you've got a
good power supply basement there so I
think it's time for a new case I would
keep the pure bass 600 because it's a
it's a decent case if you're not putting
you know hot running Hardware in there
it's very quiet it does the job that
regular salsa I mean this just kind of
smacks of being kind of hastily put
together to be honest yeah there's
there's just a floating 2.5 yeah there's
a see down in the bottom cabling looks
like it was plugged in but there doesn't
seem to really be much attempt at cable
management here other than the routing
behind the motherboard tray I've liked
the 24 pin up here could also use a
reread of this cable here coming off of
the deep cool captain and there's a
decent amount of power supply sag I'm
sorry a graphics card sag going on here
as well power supply supply seg that's
that's the way the sweeping the nation
so yeah I mean I think the case
could be worked with but yeah like
either a new case or just sort of a
rebuild or something like that
the hardware looks good it can tell that
like you know you you swapped out the
fans on the deep cool captain and these
are all LED fans so there's some
investment going on here but I just feel
like it needs a new home or a REE
reinstall to kind of tie everything
together I agree okay all right
next isaac course i think Rison v 1600
system at four point one gear Hertz
that's a nice overclock at one point
four to five volts really what damn you
got a very nice lottery winner here
1,600 there Osric gaming k4x 370
motherboard 16 gigs of DDR 420 133
megahertz memory I want you I want you
to have a faster memory with this
overclocked yeah I want I want this
reenact so you might not be able to
maintain this overclock if you improve
your memory speed that could be why he's
been hitting four point yeah for Rison
like there's just there's a there's a
very noticeable drop-off and in in
performance if you're going about 21 33
or 2,400 I haven't seen much with 2166
but 3,000 is kind of my default so yeah
me too I would very much consider a swap
out or an upgrade of the memory kit or
it looks like you have two kits in there
so that might be a challenge you're
working with as far as hitting higher
speeds turning 50 gigs samsung 860m bit
- SSD hundred twenty gig intel SSD one
terabyte hard drive fiber two gig hard
drive - two graphics cards dear from
980ti
hybrid and a 970 why does he have an SLI
bridge on those and what is this is a
what's his otech what is this GT 710 a
1x is that a he's gonna 1x card in there
is that a graphics card - yeah so 1x
some mining but it wait I don't know why
he is and is there any physics is there
any point to have a
SLI bridge then even if the bottom card
is physics
why would you have an SLI bridge on it
use the sli bridge is not required for
physics I mean I guess you could put it
on there first
but yeah it's not it's not working
Nvidia drivers will not allow you to sli
to different graphics cards together
right and want to even lights to SLI two
of the same graphics cards if they do
have different memory setups so bizarre
that's strange to me maybe he just
really liked his old graphics cards he
wanted to keep them around alright um
beyond that so so some strange
configuration you upgrade your memory
gear like I don't know why the zotac
card is going in there if you're doing
some strange rendering stuff that's
actually making use of it then okay but
if not just like just remove it that's
not necessary
even though 970 I would be on the fence
about but maybe you're getting some use
out of that the color scheme here is a
little odd to me then respects the neon
green with the red and then the blue fan
and the christmas-themed that's a little
all I can think of when I see red and
green the intake fan is also blue RGB K
so curious why don't just do it all
green yeah that would look sweet like or
all red because you already have the
sleeved cables then do all green but you
already have the memory and the
motherboard heat sinks that are it so I
don't know I don't know which came first
the cables are the motherboard and RAM
if the motherboard and RAM came first
then I would have gone for red cables
honestly what's feel asleep like I don't
know what to tell them what to do like
what do you do here upgrade your memory
that's all I can say
upgrade remember you get rid of that
extraneous graphics card and I don't
have any aesthetic suggestions for you
because I don't know where to go with
this either embrace the red or embrace
the green they don't I don't feel like
they're working together
there's no there's no easy fix to my
mind I don't like how the tubing for the
graphics card and CPU are crossing each
other like yeah that's another really
awkward to me it just doesn't it seems
like it's clashing something the nation
obviously doesn't affect you avoid
usually all right Isaac you've confused
us and baffled us congratulate thank you
for sending us your build yep I hope
we've helped you in some small degree
and finally finally cool ray faked the
8700 K at 5 gigahertz 64 gigs of g.skill
32 hundred megahertz ram Maximus 10 2
terabyte 960 pro 2 terabyte no dobla and
yeah two gtx 1080p eyes this thing is
fully loaded that's colorful interesting
how you have your your arrows for your
graphics cards set to exhaust at the
front of your case and you've in your in
taking air from the rear of your case
she's sailing with that new reverse
airflow trend ah you must have seen
Dimitri from hardware connexes video
recently and got inspired this was
probably taking a two hours ago the
bottom has an intake tube bottoms an
intake tube so I wonder I'm sure it's
fine I'm sure it's fine I just I hope
you have a desk filter of some sort on
the back of that rear fan just to
minimize dust buildup and I appreciate
the fact that you've completely loaded
up this case and filled every nook and
cranny for the most part crazy amount of
just radiators like three radiators in
here and you're not even custom
water-cooled like three a OS in a single
build is pretty nuts
a liquid cooling going on oh yeah very
cool with like it looks like you you
kinda are going with this red theme
initially like if you remove the RGB LED
strip that's going around your entire
system looks like you've got red
everything else red fans red cables red
Ram
but then you've got RGB on the LED
strips so that that's that's totally
fine and dandy cable management very
pretty clean good job on that the only
thing here aesthetically that's standing
out to me all right I got three things
to point out these are all pretty like
not a huge deal but just since I'm
looking for stuff the optical drive
stands out to me a little bit you can
mask that off or cover the outside
somehow those optical drives just just
stand out
I'm not saying remove it because I know
some people still use them but that
could that could maybe help your cabling
for your graphics cards yeah is just not
not as smooth as it could be you've got
you've got the cable combs and
everything if you could even out those
whoosh coming back from both of those
they can more symmetric yeah or more
parallel to each other perhaps might
look a little cleaner then finally the
cables for yeah fans coming from your
front coolers here they're just they're
kind of stretched across get some extent
open void here so an extension something
like that to allow you to rewrite those
and hide those again nitpicky stuff
overall this is a pretty sweet looking
build obviously when you get a lot of
colors going on it's not going to be for
everyone some people prefer a two-tone
thing or something like that but I think
for for all the hardware you got
everything it's looking really clean
yeah all right well done thank you very
much cool ray and that concludes pimp
mop pcs so we can move on now to tech
news starting with an article from
overclocked 3d letting us know that the
highly anticipated 4k 144 Hertz
HDR gsync monitors that we've been
hearing so much about for the last year
or so are finally upon us and can be
could be releasing as soon as two weeks
from now hey hey
these come from both Asus and Acer camps
very exciting a PC world's Gordon mom
recently checked out the Acer X 27
predator which features g-sync HDR 10 4k
140
Hertz panel and compared it against his
4k sixty Hertz g-sync xB 271 HK which is
also an Acer panel very very very very
popular gaming display he was playing
Final Fantasy go for it he was playing
Final Fantasy 15 for his testing and he
reported excellent color accuracy on the
new panel brighter highlights and deeper
blacks very much what you would expect
from an HDR 10 supported display and I'm
guessing Final Fantasy 15 is also HDR
supported um he said that the that the
xB 2 7 1 H K looked washed out in
comparison and it's kind of hard to tell
on camera I guess you know but I'm sure
in person it's more apparent and that's
obviously something that would would get
taken care of if you had a high quality
HD our display is kind of separating
those those highlights and those shadows
a bit more so that things don't look as
washed out there's more contrast you get
better contrast better black levels with
this with this quantum dot display which
is a you up tronic by the way and
features 384 zone full array local
dimming ooh 384 zones a lot of zone so a
lot of zones apparently the one of the
TVs I recently reviewed hasn't hit
YouTube yet it'll only had it was 65
inch TV only has like like under a
hundred zones so I mean push off well I
even bothered with any zones right I'm
not gonna I'm gonna destroy that TV soon
no just kidding the TV's pretty cool
anyway unsaid that the panel's gonna
release as soon as two weeks from now at
an unknown price asus has a competing
display there PG to 7uq there was not
quite as much information on that panel
because that's not the one that gordon
checked out but that should be releasing
around the same time expects pricing to
be a lot
expensive upwards of 2 grand I would
assume 2 grand I'm thinking 2 grand hmm
I would assume but who knows GPP has
been killed off by its own in scepter
Nvidia themselves have killed off GPP
the geforce partner program no more huh
nope this is uh sort of a video I was
watching from gamers Nexus Steve talks
about it in his glorious way and it's a
good video you guys should check it out
he has a lot of good information a lot
of good analysis and sort of criticism
of Nvidia and how they've kind of
approached this playing the victim as he
says with this whole situation they
released a sort of retirement letter an
official retirement letter for GP P and
we're basically saying like you know we
were just trying to do something cool
for the gamers so that you know everyone
would benefit but the media and
consumers are the reason why we can't
have nice things and so they kind of
just you know they pitched it from the
perspective of this this makes us look
like the victim and in reality I feel
like the consumers were more so the
victim that's why consumers were lashing
out so much it's because they could sort
of foresee this causing a lot of
problems but you know Nvidia being
Nvidia and Steve being Steve you know he
I think you know I agree with him you
know for the most part on all this stuff
he also mentioned that you know
influencers or the industry is becoming
more heavily influencer based and less
reviewer based which kind of lessons
manufacturers ability to take criticism
or to take any sort of judgment they see
it as sort of like now a jab instead of
constructive criticism and so any sort
of critiquing or or judgment of any kind
it's kind of turned them soft in a way
because a lot of a lot of people online
now who are checking out hardware and
doing tech videos aren't necessarily
professional reviewers they haven't been
you know they're not it's not like Brian
Shrout you know has a million sub
channel on YouTube and he's just like
doing unboxing videos you have an a
million and I do doing boxing videos
occasionally yes so so maybe maybe I'm
part of the problem maybe we're all kind
of part of the problem to some degree us
youtubers with our loyal followings and
you know shenanigans and and fun you
know vlog videos maybe were the problem
and manufacturers just can't handle it
when we say something negative about
them and they see it as a jab or as a
slight as Steve puts it so the other
thing that Steve mentioned that I
thought was a pretty good call-out was
he called Nvidia out because in their
letter they were saying GPP was just
supposed to be a way for consumers and
I'm paraphrasing here a way for
consumers to understand the difference
between product a and product B and
really know and understand what they
were getting when picking off product
off the store shelf and Steve's rebuttal
to that comment was well look at the GT
what was it
1030 I believe it was the GT 1030 that
Nvidia recently re-released but had
different specs than the original GT
1030 which was very controversial
because now people are buying a product
that's labeled as an existing product
thinking they're getting the same thing
when they're not even if performance was
exactly the same specifications are
different and should be labeled as a
different product and so Steve went back
to them and said you know how like I
don't I'm not buying it that's a
bullshit lie if you really cared about
consumers knowing the difference between
product a and B then you wouldn't have
done all this other shit in the past so
it's it's a good video it's very
thought-provoking
and you know it's definitely going to to
garner some controversies not everyone's
going to agree with it but this is all
to say that GPP is no longer a thing
whatever truths existed that we never
really got to the bottom of kind of
don't matter anymore because we don't
have to deal with it anymore and it also
makes me wonder if you know if all these
manufacturers all these bored part
are just gonna stop dropping start
dropping all of their new gaming brands
that they made specifically for AMD GPUs
for example that's my biggest question
right like asus right
zeus has been developing their aries
brand that you talked about exact last
week I think they've invested time into
that they've created new products with
box art and everything like I don't know
if they've done anything as far as like
actual re tooling to like for labeling
on you know GPU shrouds or that kind of
thing but that's an investment that Asus
made based based on this GPP proposal
right I don't know what kind of
agreement they have like on the one hand
asus seems like one of the first ones to
go along with TPP but at the same time
they obviously made some investments in
developing these sub these other sub
brands they could separate off the AMD
and they're in video stuff with right
like is a Nvidia gotta compensate issues
for this like for the time and effort
that they did on this is Ares gonna
still be a thing as a sister's doesn't
keep going for him worth with that and
you pretend like like that was their
plan all along it had nothing to do with
GPP right I don't know but yeah and and
you know some people might think like oh
maybe the admin board partners are
pissed now that GPP is gone but i think
steve is also mentioning the video that
there may be some degree of a relief
from these board partners that GPP is
gone because as he was saying like there
was some sort of like unwritten laws
tied to GPP like like the whole
inventory thing like you might not get
or I'm sorry allocation you might not
get the allocation the same allocation
is someone else who is signed up with
TPP and so people these ad and board
partners are now has all of a sudden
signing onto GBP not because they're
super down and excited but out of fear
of not getting the allocation that you
know their competitors might get and so
they're there has to be some sort of
some sort of branch out of all this who
is kind of glad some some admin board
partners who are glad that GBP is no
longer happening
because it probably puts pressure on
them to some degree so it's a good video
Steve always does great work and he does
his research obviously so go ahead and
check that out I won't focus on it too
much longer otherwise you'll have no
reason to watch the video
but yes GPB is dead we can all we can
all sleep at night okay let's move on
wucf Tech recently reported on the
Samsung 970 Evo and 970 Pro nvme m dot 2
drives saying that their their new
prices the they've actually been
repriced it was announced last week
about a week ago that they were gonna
retail for a specific price and now that
figure has been lowered to even cheaper
pricing this is good these are this good
news people these are some of the best
in class and vme drives you'll be able
to get in 2018 the 970 Evo which was
initially priced last week at $119 for
the 250 gig version is now 10 bucks
cheaper at a hundred and $9.99 day the
500 gig 500 gig model went from 229
originally to 199 yay the one terabyte
model and from 449 to 399 chopping off
$50 no yeah on that one
yay and the 2 terabyte drive went from
849 to $7.99 very good well um and then
the 970 pro only has two variants the
500 gig in 1 terabyte and those are now
priced at 249 and 499 respectively that
according to the article from what I
recall mix makes these drives cheaper
than the 960 Evo and Pro drives which is
very compelling when you consider that
these new drives have been improved
across the board in every single way
which of these pictures do you like
better the two drives in parallel are
like the kind of that looks terrible it
kind of fun like hey we're know this is
that's that's boring but better than
that because that's it
they just look so uneven and at least
the other ones are parallel
they're both been a kind of uniformity
here some some of UNIF uniformity I do
appreciate the ability to choose between
either picture though I do could come
get a shot at the back maybe maybe a
side profile and uh come on
WCCO today that man dies or something
like that they need to they need a
photographer that's uh so yeah um these
things are super fast thirty five
hundred megabytes per second read twenty
five hundred megabytes per second write
five hundred thousand I ups it also
makes these drives much more competitive
against their competitors like the Intel
760 P and W DS black drives which have
been very well received so far but yeah
you've got options we've got options
people and these drives our office is
also supposed to have some crazy
endurance you could write twelve hundred
terabytes twelve hundred terabytes
written I don't know if that's that's
not per day right that's just is that
per day mmm-hmm that's terabytes written
just terabytes written which is 50%
higher than last gen so holy crap um
these will last you a while too many
terabytes so yeh if you're looking for
an nvme drives anytime soon maybe look
into those moving on this is another WCC
of tech for article from about thread
waver better for two to be exact
coming in August talking about what we
know about the new family of processors
from AMD we this isn't a thread Ripper
processor but that is not that's a
rising mainstream probably 2000 series
poor choices poor choice of imagery well
well we don't really exactly have
pictures of it for to yet a thread
Ripper there are there are three or four
yep thought that would have been more
appropriate it was like a two marker Don
to it so thread Ripper 2000 series
successful to the thread before 1000
series that's existing now we'll be
launching this August alongside the new
thread Ripper for socket motherboards
that might come out we're unsure if
these motherboards are gonna feature the
existing X 399 chipset or perhaps a new
X 499 chipset we don't know probably
depends on what Intel names their next
high-end desktop platform to be honest
the word on the street is that we can
expect a lot of new goodies with second
gen thread Ripper which is exciting
micro ATX could see a lot more love with
this new generation which I am all for
hey what up Keith Keith in the videos in
the videos same Zen + architecture 12
nanometer treatment that we've seen with
rise in second gen and there's probably
a lot more that we could predict with
Rison I'm sorry with red thread Ripper
second gen than we could with rise in
second gen because we already have rise
in second gen out on the market and so
because it's based on the same sort of
treatment and architecture there's a lot
of things we could infer about
2000-series River for example average
clock speeds for second gen risin are
came up about 300 megahertz higher than
first gen so maybe we could see a
similar trend with thread Ripper
especially with highly multi-threaded
workloads also based on second gen Rison
uplift we could anticipate 29 the 29 50
X which is the successor to the 1950 X
to hit a core clock speed of 3.7
gigahertz and a turbo of 4.35 better
overclocking potential is kind of a
given here there's been or we expect
there to be improved cash latency like
we've seen with second gen risin
especially in games where first and the
read Ripper didn't really excel it was
kind of lacking in the gaming department
so perhaps the W CCF tech speculates
that we can maybe see a 10 percent
performance lead over last generation
when it comes to latency and perhaps
gaining faster memory support is
anticipated due to an enhanced memory
controller so very much like second gen
risin thread Ripper - you can expect
support for ddr4 DRAM speeds nearly 1
gigahertz higher than its predecessor
and of course there is still based on
rise and all that so you know
infinity fabric faster speeds in memory
is going to equate to higher performance
did not mention TVP I was kind of
curious about that TDP of threader per
is first gen is 180 watts I'm wondering
if this is going to be the same because
the TDP for second gen risin is about
the same or is a little higher it's a
little higher little higher from 95 205
watts so maybe we might see you around a
200 watt TDP for threader per second gen
but if you're getting higher clocks
better overclocking potential faster
memory lower latency then I'm sure it's
probably not a huge deal we're already
kind of used to the amount of cooling
that bread ripper first-gen requires so
I wouldn't think that thread ever
hopefully knock on wood third wrapper to
is not gonna have too much more to
demand out of your cooling solution
let's move on to our last article here
for the day which is from hexxus talking
about Twitter Twitter being a shitter
shitting on your passwords admitting
admitting to the world that the
passwords that they store yours and mine
and all 330 million users have been
stored unmasked unmasked not secure
likes like Zorro
yes Phantom of the Opera Phantom of the
Opera pick your fictional hero antihero
official blog post by Twitter CTO Parag
Agora Wow Agrawal sorry
Parag agrawal sorry I have it I'm sick a
bug was found which had resulted in
users password being stored unmasked in
an internal log no indication of a
breach or misuse of said bug or
passwords but still it's advised to
change your password anyway Twitter was
one the Twitter was actually the one who
spotted the bug so this wasn't like an
outside source who blew the lid open or
anything and it's kind of interesting
kind of funny / ogz tweet here you
said we are sharing this information to
help people make an informed decision
about their account security we didn't
have to but we believe it's the right
thing to do kind of kind of a silly
snarky way to I don't know snarky is
right word but kind of a way to like say
like you know you should be grateful you
should be happy that we're telling you
that we compromise - your password
security yeah he's kind of saying like
you're welcome that your passwords need
to be changed now it's kind of their
responsibility to secure our passwords
and our information because like we're
making them money they're making a
profit off of our information and that
information should be held securely so I
I think I think he's wrong I think he
should had to they should have had to
tell us absolutely I would if I was
Twitter CTO totally non Minister I feels
like they that's something they should
do yes so everyone go change your
Twitter password right now if you
haven't already make it something that's
unique and not the same password as any
of your other accounts that you care
about and holy shit
don't worry use passwords that we use
passwords what a what of what a great
time for you know companies like
LastPass and dashlane I'm sure they're
just taking this as a huge opportunity
um but those are our stories ladies and
gentlemen I can conclude we should
conclude I think we should conclude this
half of the episode with some face-off
but not just any face-off okay I caught
wind of a fan who today sent me a tweet
of a game that he made a game featuring
characters that I am all too familiar
with best the best game ever characters
like me and Paul that's right
some guy wait I should probably know his
name he should that be convenient judge
is his name Judge John John John made
Paul and I a video game it's called
awesome Hardware face-off it's the
ultimate game to end all games and I
can't imagine us playing anything else
now we're actually characters he
actually made us he developed us into
this game we're wearing our own little
shirts I've got my facial hair Paul's
got a soul patch we got our glasses on
Paul at least does my little widow's
peak is it you can even tell I'm
following a game here such great yeah oh
yeah yeah we have to get to the sushi
sushi restaurant okay on the game so
that's how it works I totally got this
excited about this yep Oh what did you
just do oh you pressed it it's not
pressing buttons I haven't started the
game yet I'm just so excited trying to
see if I can make it isn't this cool
guys does it have music
don't know okay that's okay I don't care
oh it's switched on mmm swish it today
oh it does yes beautiful
as glorious 8-bit 8-bit music let's say
numpad 0 is Kyle's Kyle's nemesis oh and
then throw Paul a bone is what you have
with spacebar okay
oh I get it yeah oh I guess we're just
playing okay so you can jump you can
jump you can even jump into the trees
very cool ceiling store so if I press
spacebar I sparing sensor dildos at you
I throw I throw August look is J inter
bottles at you it's Jays two cents I'm
stepping on J right now J yay hello Jay
wow he's so salty so so I just kick J
away wait oh wait shit oh my god
actually our voice cut oh shit it's
Wendell from level on tax it's wait are
you throwing bottles who's this guy
who's Logan's are this who's that that's
a pc perspective oh oh wait hold on
Oh Joker here's Joker productions they
Steve from gamers Nexus yes guy Dimitri
oh wait how do I get in here yeah wins
what I got to the sushi bar first oh you
bastard
yeah wait that's Steve oh yeah there
Steve I didn't say Steve you play again
okay let's go so I'm gonna try throwing
dildos at Jay this time ceilings I like
I like the fact that her ex Inc is wait
oh my dildos just go right through Jay
oh shit oh my god oh you fucker
I win oh he's sort of a bitch
stop sushi for sheezy lives Demetri
I know low and lazy Joker low and lazy
playing yeah he even has like fun fun
little speech bubbles hey Josh oh yeah
cut the fractal logos on a plate clean
you can borrow my Lambo
oh yeah this is Lance and oh yeah
Wow I just need another Luke as a
floatplane sure done a nice wait what is
it's awesome what I'm trying to hear
what the sound bites get oh nice I say
get that out of my face I don't my face
I don't know what you say oh I must have
best that must be the sound bite when I
was wrong room the dildo in your face I
[Laughter]
can play this all day
I can literally play this all day I'm
amazing Wow John think I just want to
say thank you so much from the bottom of
both of our hearts this is this is the
nicest thing that anyone's ever done
yeah I've never thought I would be in a
video game yeah that's amazing I feel
like my life is complete now me too wait
so who won we each one once okay so
should we should we both take it take a
knee or what happens now
you're driving so I don't want to force

the ground heroes heroes it heroes cuz

sculpted make some pretty good IPAs
alpine brewing some really good IPAs I
like most of what Lost Coast makes Lost
Coast is good and they sent me a care
package so that's even better I do like

Anderson Valley hey Anderson battles
good beer let's just the speedway stout
ale Smith yeah Al Smith they did a good
job clown shoes is really good if I
doubts things doubts ooh
Oscar blues I love Oscar blues because
they make such a variety of beer a lot
of breweries tend to like stick to like
or focus on one or two types but Oskar
Blues has just so many different types
and they're all delicious from Pale Ales
to stouts
- what's the Canadian brewery that does
Papa stalazs and fin du monde
oh it's escaping me oh they do a lot of
Belgians

built-in Amisha fee in December glass
too dark but fractal went cell won't
sell clear panel in North America can
you guys hook me up or make fractal make
our six sized metruff I huh
the glass is too dark for the mesh fine
yeah it is very tinted so even if you
have LEDs in there it can be kind of
hard to see which is kind of a bummer
um I don't know what you can do about
that yeah no I couldn't hook you up I
don't have like a piece of glass that
would fit the mesh if I see other than
the mesh if I see glass no way to really
mod a tinted piece of glass there are
there are independent motors who sell
side panels for for cases that don't man
that custom make from time to time but I
haven't heard anything specifically
about the mesh if I see you could
actually I don't know how helpful this
would be but go to freckles design
fractal designs website and there's like
a customer support area where you can
actually send them requests for products
if you want to see something badly
enough and you're willing to buy it let
them know they take user feedback very
seriously according to Josh and a lot of
a lot of products or design changes that
they've come out with in the past few
years I've been based heavily on user
feedback so it's worth a shot

Andrew donates a lot thank you Andrew
with copy Tex coming up later in June
will you guys be at e3 in early June
also see previous donation if you two
forgot and you know we typically skip e3
because we come back from Computex we're
incredibly jet-lagged and hey driving
into LA for an overcrowded events about
a bunch of video games that were
probably never going to play doesn't
sound that interesting
granted e3 is fun for people who aren't
jet-lagged so I probably would go
because it is local and everything else
related but like that's just the timing
I'm I was just i prioritize Computex
over e3 and I prioritize recovering from
jet lag over attempting to do stuff yeah
when I'm recovering from jet lag so yes
re maybe next year alright Douglas Park
Nick jr. that's also a cool name
$5.00 thank you sir been watching for a
while thought it was time to donate
you're damn right it is Doug I'm gonna
call you don't call me call you Doug
yeah very good timing thanks a lot for
reviews $5.00 thank you okay would you
rather be able to vocally recreate any
sound you've heard but be invisible or
be able to shape-shift into any form at
will but be mute
you've heard but be invisible be like be
invisible forever like you could even
when you like just permanently huh yeah
there's questions there's details here
that I feel like need to be figured out
first of all I would rather be my house
bowling mute yeah I would like invisible
like I feel like that's like a perk
that's a feature where as big mutes
alright but if you're stuck being
invisible if you're always invisible
like how are you gonna make how you
gonna make youtube videos are you
kidding me right channels bigger than us
never show their face they could be
invisible alright scarce so I probably
would go at the first
how could you make youtube videos of
your mute the shape-shifting thing is
it's an interesting question I'll have a
very thought thought provoking yes
alright and the Adhan five great great
british pounds
got any tips on painting or customizing
a metal laptop chassis that's an ugly
silver aka the new beige PC part also
have you cloned em got to SSDs before I
have not cloned em got to SSDs no so I'm
afraid I cannot provide you advice today
I typically always go as a clean
installation of if you're installing
windows or anything although if you're
working in a computer shop and you need
to do lots of installations I completely
understand having a preset thing or
using a cloned install um painting a
chassis that's an ugly silver spray
self-etching primer is what I've used
before because it kind of works its way
into the metal you have to use like you
have to like use proper air filtration
and everything because it's made for
working on car parts but yeah you just
want to make sure you want to make sure
that you get something that adheres to
it if it's silver and it's plastic then
you might have a slightly more difficult
time because certain plastic finishes
are harder to get to paint to stick to
I'm sorry we can't provide you more
detailed advice than that but I don't
yeah that helps a little bit it's
probably plenty of forum post about that
trudy sloan $5.00 paul how are you like
in the year nest thermostat i've been
considering getting one myself you
yeah we gonna as the nest came with the
tesla powerwall and holler it came along
with it it's supposed to help save power
and stuff by learning your your
procedures over time turning there there
are some some security concerns about
Internet of Things things in general
nest I haven't heard too much about but
it is something that's on your network
that's communicating externally so one
thing I'd recommend is don't put it on
your main network if you have a guest
network or a secondary network connected
to that instead the other thing is it's
been working just fine it's definitely
fancier and smarter than our old
thermostat my wife has been irritated by
certain times like if it's on Eco mode
you give it a temperature range and it's
on Eco mode and it's getting warm enough
to where the AC will kick on it seems
like it the AC will be on and it'll turn
off and then back on it'll turn off and
then back on like you just weird off and
on thing that it does at times that's
the only thing I can point out that's
been sort of weird it doesn't bother me
but for her it was irritating her enough
that she just turned it off it's like
all your case panes ramping up and down
just constantly without gradually doing
it yeah but I mean it's it's cool it's
useful it's nice to be able to be like
like if you wake up in bed and it's cold
you can like pull your phone up and like
adjust the that's nice
the thermostat so that's cool hey how
can your answering I'm gonna use my
extra two four three three five dollars
no comment just the way we like it
thank you very much Dexter Oh Dexter you
commented again don't eat it again this
time of the comments yeah I take back
everything I said all the nice things I
said about you were a lie $5.00 thanks
for a great show donating twice today
just because y'all are both awesome and
so is wifey sauce yeah she's alright
you know I'll throw our bone once in a
while but thanks man I appreciate that
so nice you donated twice everyone
should donate twice especially Fred Ram
Tommy AJ 74 $50 thank you sir do
something with your wife I do every
night
now a mani-pedi maybe for those of you
without a girlfriend or wife mani-pedi
is short for manicure slash pedicure
that's something I learned being in the
you know taken scene apparently and
remind users to change passwords on all
sites using the same password as their
Twitter account very good point mr.
atomic yes if you had a year if your
Twitter password was duplicated on other
accounts changed the password for those
accounts too because anyone who could
have compromised the Twitter passwords
could potentially see what other
accounts you have and log in to those as
well so just for good practice it's
better always to be safe than sorry
thank you very much atomic and yes I
will I will treat my wife to something
worth fifty dollars in the near future
hopper dropper $5 that's all moving on
thank you very much hopper topper I
don't know why I'm talking like a sports

art Mon tints keys five dollars and 69
cents hey Paul any advice on sideburn
grooming well well
we'll just have to wait for Paul to get
back for that one um I I couldn't I
couldn't tell you I I wish I could
answer this question on his behalf but
it just it just wouldn't just wouldn't
be the same you know I just I just have
a hair stylist do it my barber my barber
just yeah you know just just make it so
I don't have to worry about it anymore
um
all right hey Paul now that you're here
we actually have a specific question for
you Oh any advice on sideburn grooming
that you've acquired over the years
sideburn grooming that's what the man's
asking uh I mean I tell them you'd have
a very profound in depth I go with
answer I use a beard or mustache trimmer
I've recently talked about this I'm
Q&amp;amp;A video last week oh how topical I
know sideburns so ultra more so yeah I
mean just a Bader mustache trimmer is
very convenient to have because usually
they have adjustments on them so you can
trim them shorter like you know when I
give them to to shaggy yeah be able to
contour around the edges and everything
I think for sideburns they should be
going down and not out oh yeah down
right like make sure they're not like
too poofy it shouldn't like widen your
face they should be straight down I
agree you know not going with the chaps
no chances of that no muttons
Jay Bell ten bucks thank you both I
built my first PC in February and I have

Belgium strong heels all of it off the

an influence that an imported beer aisle
you know they do so as does Total Wine

go wanna buy a monitor not too expensive
but still with modern features any
recommendations GPU is GTX 970 with AMD
1700 also 2 or 3 monitors setup I I
think I think your setup should be as
many monitors as you can fit 2 is good I
like to I have two 4k monitors at home
three is kind of too much like panning
for my neck yeah but to simplify
anywhere you're doing three can be
useful yeah if you if you need the third
one in sure and I would say 1440p yeah
it's 2560 by 1440 if you have an AMD
graphics card than something with
freesync would be very nice and few
video then g-sync would be nice although
that would be much more expensive yeah
Asus Acer Samsung BenQ all good brands
yeah try for IPS or VA yeah for better
color depth all those things i refresh
rate if again yep sorry we're not giving
you specific models but there's many
different monitor models yeah it would
be unfair member si-jess oh yeah look
for those specs and then find the
monitor that's best priced and next up
we have once again from Tate Fink Tate

still in pieces on the table that's
probably five feet away from me it's
completely just strewn all over the
table completely drained dried out I
haven't cleaned it like Evan actually
like gotten all the gunk off of like the
old fluid and stuff and I've kind of
decided I haven't mentioned this at all
until now but now that you bring it up
I'm probably not gonna reassemble it
ever because some of a lot of the fluid
has actually gone into the PCI Express
slots where the graphics cards were and
I'm just terrified of booting that up
again with anything installed into it
even if the fluids non-conductive
whatever I just don't want to take a
chance again better safe than sorry so
I'm just gonna push on work with hot

your compressor will kill fast that
seems like a run-on sentence ah don't
know how the nest works watch out you
don't want to just cycling cycling on
and off might kill it fast it it's not
like it happens on off on off on off or
whatever it goes for a while
shuts off and then turns back on and
then goes for a little while then shuts
off and turn turns back on I guess mmm
