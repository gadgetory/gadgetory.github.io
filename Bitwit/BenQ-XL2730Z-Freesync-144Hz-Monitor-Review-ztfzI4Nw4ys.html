gosh-darn excited because I'm taking a
look at the first free sync supported
display that I have ever had the
privilege of reviewing this is the BenQ
XL 273 0z a 144 hertz 2560 by 1440 TN
panel with 8-bit color depth and a 1
millisecond response time the specs on
this display make it a direct competitor
to the G sync ready asus rog swift but
retails for about 135 bucks cheaper
which is great news for AMD graphics
users well it may not have the fierce
industrial design found on the Swift
that makes it look like the bastard
child of Peabody and Atlas from Portal 2
then Q chops up a modern style of their
own and I rather like the simplistic
design of the stand which features tilt
swivel height and 90 degree pan
adjustment at 18 millimeters thick the
bezel could be slimmer but it's still
thin enough to run a triple setup
without much visibility gap on the right
side is your power button and buttons
for the on-screen display though BenQ
includes a wired controller for easier
navigation which works like a charm
although you can place the controller
and the shallow cup holder thing being
able to physically secure the unit to
the base would have been a nice touch as
my mouse and keyboard cables were quick
to knock it out of place most gamers
including myself will rejoice at the
monitors non-reflective matte screen one
time I played Arkham Knight on a glossy
monitor and could actually see the
disappointed look on my face on the left
side is a headset holder pulling out is
advised to USB 3 ports running on a
built-in hub and mic and headphone jacks
you also get a sturdy carrying handle at
the top of the stand making this panel
an ideal choice for land parties on the
underbelly of the display is an upstream
port for your USB hub and a plethora of
video inputs including d-sub DisplayPort
which is what you'll need to take
advantage of free sync to HDMI ports one
of which is 2.0 and dual link DVI
there's also a mini USB port for
connecting that OSD controller a
microphone pass-through if you won't be
having your audio signal carry via HDMI
or DisplayPort and a quick release
button for removing your panel if you
wish to toss the stand aside and use the
built-in base amount for wall mounting
or another stand of your choice
additionally you can keep voracious
thieves at bay by locking down your
panel with a Kensington lock when
attending public land events so far this
panel has me intrigued but the real
question here is how does it perform
with day-to-day tasks
and more importantly gaming well despite
being a TN panel having 72% NTSC color
gamut supports puts the color range of
this bad boy fairly close to my
three-year-old IPs though I'll admit the
colors don't pop quite as much the just
okay viewing angle is what you might
expect from a TN and with some fine
tuning in the OSD the contrast ratio
looks great offering enough granularity
between blacks and whites during
low-light scenes to truly see the
monitor at its best however jump into a
fast-paced action game with free sync
enabled and you get nothing but super
sharp visuals with no tearing stuttering
or visible tracing of any kind this
makes my IPS panel look like a blurry
mess in comparison and ultimately a hard
panel to come back to once getting used
to the BenQ the monitor supports a
generous refresh rate window from 40 to
144 Hertz meaning you'll maintain that
crispy smooth gameplay as long as your
frame rate stays within that range what
typically tends to happen if your frame
rate ventures outside of those
parameters is that the image begins to
generate an unpleasant flickering effect
on screen
AMD combats this issue by giving users
the option to enable or disable vsync
while free sync is active with each
option barring its own symptoms enabling
vsync opens the door for some potential
lag while disabling vsync introduces
some screen tearing now just because I
didn't run into either of these issues
during my testing doesn't mean you won't
so my advice if you're experiencing
these problems frequently is to adjust
your in-game quality settings so that
you rarely ever dip below 40 fps now if
you can manage that the variable refresh
rate on this panel delivers ultra fast
performance that really breathes new
life into your games especially when it
comes to those adrenaline-pumping
first-person shooters while I wouldn't
recommend the xl2 seven-30 z4 things
like color grading or photo editing AMD
graphics users who are serious about
gaming will find that picking up this
freesync display really is one of the
best upgrades you can make to your
gaming experience without cracking open
your actual PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
