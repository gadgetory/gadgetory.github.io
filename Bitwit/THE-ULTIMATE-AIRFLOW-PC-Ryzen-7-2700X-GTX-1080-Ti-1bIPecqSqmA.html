what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel today we are assembling April's
pc of the month just in time as the
month is about to end it's very exciting
build today we're actually assembling a
2nd gen rising system that's heavily
targeted towards high or big airflow so
there's not going to be an ounce of
liquid in today's build I haven't had
the best luck with liquid cooled systems
recently as some of you guys are already
aware so maybe that's what prompted this
build who knows but it's gonna be super
cool ha starting off the line with the
AMD Rison 720 700 X with 8 cores 16
threads a max boost clock of 4.3
gigahertz also see how far we can
actually overclock this guy perhaps in a
part 2 video pairing that with 16 gigs
of g.skill sniper X ddr4 3400 speed with
those lovely white camouflaged heat
sinks that will be going into an MSI x4
70 gaming and 7 AC motherboard which
pretty much has all the bells and
whistles you could ask for a very
handsome looking motherboard as well I
might add just below that you'll find
the geforce gtx 1080 TI gaming cooling
our cpu is the Noctua NHD 15 SCA m4
which is one of the most prized air
coolers on the market for high
performance users will also be pairing
that with the NF a 14 FLX fan also from
Noctua this will actually be replacing
one of the 140 millimeter fans in our
case more on that in just a bit
over here we've got an 850 watt g2 L
power supply from EVGA 80 plus gold
certified modular cables it also lights
up that the connectors which is really
cool unfortunately we won't be able to
see it to due to the cases power supply
basement but at least we'll know it's
there for our boot drive and frequently
used applications we have an RD 400 256
gig m2 nvme from OCZ and to the right of
that you'll find a set of beautifully
sleeved custom cables from the folks
over at cable mod this is part of their
pro series I actually configured and
customized these myself through their
online configurator you can find out
more in the description below also from
cable mod we have one of their 60
centimeter wide beam LED strips in white
to better
see just how horrific are not to a fans
are and last but not least we have the H
500 P mesh from coolermaster which is
one of the best airflow cases on the
market right now with its full front
mesh panel and two 200 millimeter fans
at the front but what could make this
case even cooler is if we ditched those
fans and replace them with four 200
millimeter not to offense these are the
NF 820 PWM premium fans and they will
make the system as cool as it will be
ugly again knock to offense hideous but
super super good so those are all the
parts guys you can find links to
everything in the description below
I am super stoked to get this under way
so let's go ahead and start building I
just hope that it doesn't fly away from
me at the end of it
hold on so here's where I realize the
200 by 30 millimeter not to offense are
too thick to fit under the top and front
panels of the case now the manufacturer
page lists support for 200 millimeter
fans in these locations but fails to
mention any thickness limitations
stranger still is that even if the
Noctua fans were thin enough the
mounting holes don't even line up with
the holes in the case so if you're
planning to add 200 millimeter fans to
your H 500 B it's probably best to just
use Coolermaster fans as for our build
here's where I decide to snag the 200
millimeter fans from the original H 500
P and mount them where I would have put
these beautiful knock - it's on the
bright side the Coolermaster fans do
have RGB which as we all know improves
airflow by 50% anyway carry on
alright guys here's the system in all of
its glory it's actually looking pretty
good I mean granted it's probably one of
the most mismatched systems that I've
ever built so it's very aesthetically
displeasing but it kind of has its own
ugly charm to it I don't really know how
to explain it but here it is you'll
notice this big beautiful dock to a
cooler is looking fabulous right now
this fan right here is actually
protruding out a bit more Z wise than
this one simply because we had to give
some additional clearance for those
memory sticks but we can still fit that
side panel on just fine the LED strip is
incredibly bright especially reflecting
off of this white interior looks very
nice actually and there's just a ton of
air moving through you can just feel it
and despite how much fan is in this
system it's incredibly quiet even with a
side panel on being just inches away
from it it is so quiet so I can't wait
to test thermals and acoustics guys let
me know what your expectations are for
the system in the comments below I want
to hear what you guys are thinking about
it so far but that's gonna do it for now
guys toss a like on the video if you
enjoyed it get subscribed you can check
me out on floatplane if you want to
watch my videos a week really without
ads I'll put a link for that in the
description below until next time guys
thanks for watching have a good one and
I'll see you all in the next okay
best outro ever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
