what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel hope you're all doing well today
we're taking a look at this product
right here this is the litter robot 3
from auto pets and it's a litter box
pretty much I never thought I'd be
reviewing a litter box on this channel
to be honest but the moment I caught
wind of it being a cat owner myself I
could not pass up the opportunity to
take a look at it it's basically
supposed to be the greatest automated
self-cleaning litter box on the market
right now and for 500 US dollars it damn
well better be now don't get me wrong I
love my two cats to death they're soft
and sweet and cuddly but they also poop
a lot and they're a lot to clean up
after especially if you have two of them
and I think most cat owners would agree
with me that cleaning out the litter box
is the worst parts about owning a cat
and this product aims to take away the
hassle of cat ownership so we're gonna
be taking a look at it today I'm super
excited and if you guys stay till the
second half of this video I'll actually
be introducing this product to my cats
at home for the very first time we'll
get to see the reaction should be pretty
fun but let's first talk about this
product and just sort of what it looks
like I mean it looks like kind of looks
like Kenny from South Park every time I
look at it that's what I think of so
it's got this giant globe we'll call it
the globe and the sort of plastic bonnet
that goes over it's pretty much full
plastic construction very sturdy though
now obviously the globe is where you
would put the litter and where the cat
would do is business and we'll discuss
how that works in just a moment but the
inside here at least for the bottom half
where the litter would go is lined with
a really solid rubber it's very high
quality super durable easy to clean
we'll talk about that momentarily and it
just seems like it's built to last
additionally we've got some buttons here
and some LED indicators in front of the
globe is a removable rubber mat that's
used to catch any litter that your cats
may kick out whenever they leave the
globe but it's pretty small and it's
probably not going to catch everything I
would imagine so you might want to
invest in a larger mat that you place in
front of it just to ensure that you
catch everything now you can see here
the mat actually sits on top of a handle
that allows you to pull out this
removable tray which gives you access to
a lined baggie where all of the poops
and other clumped bits fall into
after a cleaning cycle has taken place
now in order to show you guys how all
that crap gets to the bottom of this
thing in the first place we should
probably talk about how the heck this
thing works so for starters you need to
fill it up with litter all right and you
need to use a clumping litter it can't
be purely absorbent clumping is
essential for this product to work you
can use bead or crystallized litter
that's totally fine as long as it's fine
enough in order to pass through the
internal mesh screen after you pour the
litter up to the fill line and turn the
unit on you're pretty much ready to go
at that point there's a cat sensor that
will detect when a cat is inside of the
globe and as soon as your cat leaves the
globe after he's done doing his business
there will be a short wait period or a
wait time before of the unit starts its
self-cleaning cycle at that point the
entire globe starts to rotate slowly and
it does emit a low humming noise while
it does this however it's very quiet and
I can't imagine most cats would be
bothered by it or scared of it unless
they're super super timid or something
like that we'll have a chance to test it
out later I suppose and then as it
continues spinning it eventually sifts
out all of the clumps and it separates
the clumps with this internal mesh
screen from all the litter and then at
that point the clumps get dumped through
the poop chute is what I suppose I would
call it and then it gets all trapped
into the bottom tray here that we showed
earlier afterwards the globe starts to
rotate back to its original position and
it actually overshoots its home point
for a moment and that's just so that it
can return the litter bed back to a very
flat state so that when your cat jumps
in there next time that's not all
lopsided one of these cleaning cycles
takes about two and a half minutes to
fully complete and then it's ready to go
again I should also mention that if a
cat tries to jump into the dome while
the cycle is in progress the cat sensor
will pick it up and it'll immediately
stop until the cat leaves now circling
back to disposal for a minute the manual
suggests replacing the bag in the tray
once a week if you have one cat or twice
a week if you have two cats so it's
actually not too bad removal of the bag
is super easy basically just take the
bag out and it sits it's good to go it's
really easy to replace the bags as well
it latches on to these four plastic tabs
you can buy more bags from auto pets if
you like or you can just buy your
10 to 13 gallon trash bags at the store
that might be cheaper now one small
shortcoming that I haven't experienced
myself yet because I haven't really used
this with my cats but I have seen in
other reviews is that because the poop
chute is sort of located to the left of
the unit anytime this thing gets really
full it'll start piling up specifically
on the left side of the tray which means
it could get pretty filled up when it's
not actually full so maybe every once in
a while you might have to take the tray
out sort of do this a little bit and
flatten out the level of of crap in here
before putting it back in that'll give
you a little bit more time before you
have to fully replace it I should also
mention the unit features a handy LED
indicator letting you know when the
trash bag is full and needs replacing
but moving on to some extra features
let's say you're not too privy with the
whole automated system here and you just
wanted to run the clean cycle manually
you can easily do that basically you
would just turn the unit off and any
time you notice that your cat has left
the special present inside for you you
basically just turn it on and it will
automatically do a single cleaning cycle
now for all of you cat owners out there
who have to have the litter box in your
bedroom first off my condolences and you
probably don't want something like this
keeping you up at night as it's doing an
automated cleaning cycle so what you can
actually do is put it into sleep mode
and from the time you enter sleep mode
it'll actually go inactive for eight
hours and that's repeatable so every 24
hours it'll stop working for that eight
hours from when you initially set it so
you only have to set at once and it's
pretty much never gonna wake you up in
the middle of night now I did mention
wait time earlier wait time is basically
the time between when your cat leaves
the globe to when the cycle actually
starts and basically you can change that
time you can either do 3 7 or 15 minutes
the reason why you might want a longer
wait time is because some litter
actually takes longer to clump and if
it's not clumping properly you don't
give it enough time this product is not
gonna be quite as effective so you can
actually change that on the fly with one
of these buttons now obviously cats have
pretty good night vision in fact it's
much better than our own but with age
some cats revision starts to deteriorate
and for that reason they've actually
built in a nightlight inside of the
glove it's all you know darkness
activated so as soon as the lights go
out it automatically pops on this blue
light and unfortunately it is not our G
what the hell are we doing with this
thing get out of here now the manual
doesn't say you have to regularly
replace the litter it's pretty sanitary
on its own but in the event that you
wanted to clean the inside of the actual
globe you would have to get that litter
out somehow so there is an empty button
once you press that the globe starts to
rotate I'll be it in the opposite
direction as the cleaning cycle and that
essentially dumps everything all the
poop the pee and the litter gets
funneled into the bottom tray at that
point you can start tearing this thing
apart and prep it for cleaning starting
with the bonnet there's a plastic tab on
either side you push that inward pops
off very easily and the globe itself you
pretty much just lift it straight off of
the base the globe itself which is gonna
be obviously the dirtiest part of this
whole product is completely circuit and
electric free there's no wiring or any
sort of electronic components inside of
it which means you can pretty much blast
it with a power hose or something like
that to get it super clean you can use
soap it's totally fine with that as long
as it's a mild soap and nothing too
toxic for your cats obviously and then
you pretty much let it dry the rubber
itself dries nearly instantly which is a
nice bonus and then you put it back
together fill it back with litter and
you're ready to go once again so there
you go those are the basics I'm sure
you've learned more about litter boxes
in the last five minutes than you have
in your entire life but with that said I
think it's time to bring this guy home
we have to introduce it to my cats for
the very first time and get the reaction
cats react oh my god that's gonna be the
clickbait title this video and yeah we
can't do a proper full letterbox review
without the cats opinions so on that
note let's go home
all right so we are now into the
following morning here at the bit wid
home base it's been about 12 hours since
we formally introduced our cats to the
litter robot and the way we did that was
we tried to make it as easy of a
transition as possible
for starters we placed the unit in the
exact same spot as their old litter box
just to reinforce the idea that this is
the area where you go to the bathroom
and then after we filled up the litter
bed with some fresh litter we actually
took a scoop of their old used literate
no it sounds kind of gross but we
sprinkled that on the very top just to
familiarize them with the scent so when
they stick their head in there and they
sniff around they go oh this is familiar
I pooped here before hurray for poop
familiarity and then to top it all off
we took a bottle of sprayable catnip and
just lightly sprayed the litter mat that
goes right in front of the globe that
was just to introduce them to a familiar
pleasant scent that is supposed to relax
them and just keep them from being too
intimidated by this large foreign object
now another pro tip we found the manual
was to lead the actual unit powered off
for the first couple of days just to get
the cats used to using it as a regular
litter box before you introduce the
sounds and movements that the product
makes during its cleaning cycle now
surprisingly within the first hour or so
our boy cat started investigating he got
curious as cats usually do and he
actually approached the globe he crawled
inside of it it took him a while to get
inside fully because I think he was
scoping out the rubber the rubber
surface it's a little bit flimsy so he
was probably trying to figure out
whether or not it was a stable surface
for him to actually stand on but once he
jumped in he took a little leak and he
jumped out and it was totally fine I
still have yet to witness the girl cat
go inside and use the litter robot but
that's not to say she didn't contribute
to any of the clumps I found this
morning at any rate I'm sure she'll see
that her brother is using it just fine
and will eventually follow suit so I'm
not too concerned there on a final note
I was a hundred percent correct in my
assumption that that litter mat would
not catch all the litter that our cats
kick out anytime they exit the globe
there's a bunch of litter on our laundry
room floor now so we'll probably have to
get a larger mat to place in front of
the unit I should also mention that the
manual specifies not to put a rug or mat
underneath the actual product and that
the product should be on a flat stable
surface just to ensure that the cat
sensor isn't thrown off and it can
accurately detect whenever a cat is
inside
hello so summing things up here speaking
from my own experience as a cat owner in
my own situation I have two cats and
they fill up my litter box twice as
quickly as a single cat household I also
have a very hectic schedule I'm
incredibly busy all the time and I have
limited time whether I'm away or at home
so for me this is a worthwhile
investment now if you only have one cat
and you're only cleaning out the litter
box a few times a week then you probably
don't need this product to be honest go
ahead and spend that $500 elsewhere but
for all of us multi cat owners with
incredibly busy lives who travel often
mind you this product is a total godsend
and I would highly recommend you at
least try one I believe they have a 90
day money back guarantee so zero risk if
you if you want to try it doesn't work
out for you if your cats are terrified
of it or something like that
then you really don't have much to lose
but that is pretty much gonna do it for
now for this very odd and interesting
review go ahead and toss a like on it if
you enjoyed it and feel free to leave
