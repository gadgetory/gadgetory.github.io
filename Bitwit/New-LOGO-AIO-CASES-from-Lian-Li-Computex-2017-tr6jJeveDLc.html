Leanne Lee look at this look at this
what is that logo I don't even recognize
that lawyer it looks like they're going
under sort of a rebrand here I actually
like the new logo and you know what as
we're about to see in a bit Leanne Lee
is making some big changes to their
marketing their branding and I I fully
approve
I really do approve we'll talk more
about that in a bit but first of all
look at this this is also something new
from Lian Li that we haven't seen in the
past a 240 millimeter liquid AIO
now they've actually done a
collaboration here with a company called
synthesis I believe they're an overseas
partner but you can just first of all
just take a look at this aesthetic and
we'll get some b-roll shots as well but
a very different sort of design for the
radiator this isn't your typical just
black-on-black Asia tech cooler so this
is a really unique design look at this
full copper fins full copper print stack
these are not copper plated this is just
full straight of copper so it adds quite
a bit of heft to the entire unit but
definitely breathes quality all around
kind of a nice aluminum finish here if
you look really close you can see that
it does say it is expandable so there's
an expandable AIO
the tubing is a very nice and sleek
doesn't twist very easily so no kinkajou
if you're in you know trying to cram
this into tight spaces whew and then
you've also got I believe these are just
regular standard Jena quarter inch
fittings don't quote me on that though I
didn't get a confirmation you can also
disconnect from the water block as well
speaking of copper you get a cool copper
plate at the bottom just peeking through
right there
got to love that copper if that extra
heat conductivity and all yo oh yes the
pump itself the pump is integrated into
the radiator in this little black little
black hub here and there's a PWM fan
port right there very very nice for the
most part the water block itself looks
very heavy-duty the only little critique
that I have is that I wish the branding
wasn't so loud with the LAN lis there
and the since this I know that might
sort of deter some of the gamers from
this guy but for the most part a very
fantastic Rick if you're not so hot on
the copper color you probably won't be
seeing it much
once it's all installed in your system
especially if you're adding some
and including the two 120 s that are
that are going to be mounted on this of
course and you'll forgive me I kind of
got ahead of myself here and forget to
tell you the actual model name of this
unit which is the IX R 240 go ahead and
confirm it over here on this box there
it is
the eye XR 240 from lately and since
this so keep an eye out for it should be
coming out relatively soon this is a
finished product or a finished model by
the way this isn't a prototype it's
going to be coming out very soon so keep
your eyes peeled shaving this bad boy
out
holy moly this is the PCV 3000 over 3000
this is their flagship case alright and
it's we actually saw this a little bit
at CES this year or the last Computex I
don't know it's been so long but this is
a more refined and finished model the
one that we saw earlier they've
definitely made some changes since then
but essentially full ATX actually you
can do ATX pretty much fit anything you
want here just look at how fast this
radiator is all right with a quad I
think that's quad 120 s looks like you
could probably also fit some 140 s in
there back to back to back so obviously
custom water cooling is the main game
here you can see we've actually going to
dedicated a reservoir mount right there
at the bottom sort of over the sort of
compartmentalized middle bracket so
we've got sort of the the motherboard
and CPU of course and then the bottom
area with your cable management radiator
and power supply if we take a look at
the back here completely to list
not even any thumb screws I'm going to
break things right here it just comes
off like that I just did that with one
hand while filming just tons of room for
cable management lots of rubber grommets
just a ridiculous amount of harddrive
support here I really like the fact that
all the trays are fully modular and
toolless you can go ahead and remove
them if you want to swap out some more
fun stuff and we've also got another
hard drive cage down here full ATX power
supply at the back bounded vertically
just tons of room for cable management
thoughtful awful rubber grommets as well
look at this to get a couple of couple
mounting spots person two and a half
inch SSDs can't forget about those and
in case you were worried about the front
ventilation there is no shortage of mesh
on the sides you can actually kind of
see through right there it's going all
the way up and down since this is a
fairly tall case you are getting full of
ventilation up and down for the most
part I should also mention a tempered
glass side panel of course why not and
yeah what else what else is there to say
what else do you want for me just go
ahead and buy three of these right now
and I was asking
for a price point on this guy and it is
of course their flagship model so it's
gonna be a bit more high-end we're
talking anywhere from four to five
hundred dollars ballpark in it but let
me know what you guys think about that
that sort of a price range in the
comments below if you think it's fair
and what you think of the case aesthetic
overall alright guys this is the Alpha
series the new family of cases from Lian
Li look a little bit different don't
they kind of refreshing to see sort of a
different design although they are still
providing no shortage of tempered glass
which is of course very beautiful and
typically in leaf fashion but we've got
the Alpha 550 which is the more premium
model and the Alpha 330 price point just
right off the bat 170 to 180 for the 550
and one 100 to 110 for the three 330 but
the cool thing is that they both feature
the same internal layout the only things
that are really different are first of
all the RGB LED accents that you have at
the top of the 550 as well as the
tempered glass panel at the top of the
case that you do not get with the 330
however they have provided a dust filter
removable dust filter that is magnetic
and you got you've got plenty of
radiator options in this case as well as
you can kind of already get a glimpse of
let's go ahead and go over there where's
a patrol again I think they have some of
the more internals showing on those
cases there let's go over there so here
we have a look at a naked alpha 550 with
all the side panels removed so we can
get a better look at the internals
plenty of radiator support you get
triple 120 or 140 at the top and the
front with the removable dust filter
which I believe is magnetic wifey sauce
will demonstrate Oh beautiful
plenty of airflow obviously and water
cooling options in this case now don't
quote me on this but I believe I
overheard them say that the case is
going to come with a dedicated reservoir
mounting right here so you could
actually have a nice reservoir here or
you could mount it to the back of the
wall with these flexible mounting strips
results are very nice large CPU cooler
cutouts always appreciated look at this
power supply shroud so cable management
should be top-notch I wish I wish we had
some rubber grommets in here but
unfortunately you just kind of have to
slide them behind this reservoir wall I
do appreciate the ample cutouts for
routing cables on through your power
supply shroud though sometimes they
sometimes the cases the case
manufactures forget about that but it
looks likely emily has thought that
through on the backside where your
business end goes you get plenty of
storage options you get either mounting
points for two three and a half inch or
three two and a half inch drives on the
little uh this little bridge here you
can actually remove the two thumb screws
they are captive and then it's sort of
lowers on the hinge and you can remove
the entire bracket for easy installation
there's also bracket for a couple three
and a half inch or two and a half inch
drives once again plus another three and
a half inch drive cage at the bottom of
the case that looks like it's flexible
can sort of slide back and forth
depending on what kind of clearance you
need let me know what you guys think of
these cases so far
I personally am digging them at this
point and in case you're wondering when
these are coming out probably after
summer you can probably expect them
anywhere between August and September
timeframe
according to Lian Li and these are
pretty much finalized I mean there's a
little bit more to do they are actually
going to opt out of using the mesh
ventilation on the sides here for a top
and bottom ventilation that we've very
much commonly seen on cases like the
NZXT three obviously the NZXT s340 sort
of has the same sort of an elation
airflow for the front and that means
that they're also going to have to
extend this tempered glass side panel
all the way to the front of the case so
that it's completely flush it will look
a lot nicer once it's all done but
already a pretty good start here for the
Alpha series from LAN Li</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
