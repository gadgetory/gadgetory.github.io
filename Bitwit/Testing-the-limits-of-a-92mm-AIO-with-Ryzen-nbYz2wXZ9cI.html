case a for v3 build that I assembled a
couple weeks back well it's back again
and the CPU if you guys recall last time
in part two is overheating we've got a
rise in 720 700 X in here 8 cores 16
threads I believe it was hitting 88
degrees Celsius at the time and that was
clocked at 4 gigahertz running
completely stock it's just a little too
hot for my lucky so today what I wanted
to try to do is swap that out for a
risin 720 700 it is running at a lower
base in boost clock however the other
difference here though is a lower TDP 65
Watts on the 2700 compared to 105 on our
2700 X so hopefully that lowers the
temperature is quite a bit with our 92
millimeter liquid arrow from Ace of Teck
this is a 545 LC and it's probably the
only 92 millimeter liquid i/o that you
can purchase right now at least in the
u.s. from what I could tell if we
overclock horizon 7 2700 to the same
clock speed that our 2700 X was running
at which is 4 gigahertz I'm curious to
see if the temperatures are going to be
any different because it is a lower TDP
chip we're dealing with some thermal
constraints here in a case this size so
it should be interesting to see how
everything behaves so why don't we get
the CPU swapped in and conduct some
quick
all right so we've got our 2700 non ex
installed now running GTA 5 for about
15-20 minutes at this point this is the
same game that I use to test CPU temps
in part two I should also mention
ambient temps may have changed a degree
or two bearing that in mind though we
are operating at three point three
gigahertz on all eight cores right now
running bone-stock on the CPU and the
GPU for that matter now three point
three gigahertz is 700 megahertz slower
than our previous test on the 2700 X
which was again operating at four
gigahertz so of course temperatures are
gonna be quite a bit cooler and as you
can see there in hardware info we are
operating right now at about sixty
degrees Celsius which is a whole
twenty-eight degrees cooler than the 88
C we were experiencing earlier that
being said like I mentioned earlier I do
want to overclock this 2700 and get it
back up to the same speed as our 2700 X
and see if we're still hitting 88 C so
let's go ahead and try it out okay so
we're back at 4 gigahertz on all cores
with the voltage of one point three
eight one two five that was the first
number that I sort of guesstimated might
be good to reach stability for this
overclock and so far we've been playing
for half an hour without a single hiccup
however our temperatures aren't doing so
great we're hitting 86 C I think we just
got 286 see on the package which is only
just a hair cooler if anything a hair
cooler it's within variance of the 2700
X at the same clock speed so I'd like to
go back into the BIOS at this point
fiddle around with our voltage some more
and see if we can actually lower the
temperatures without sacrificing
stability so there was a little bit here
that that I didn't get to record because
the system crashed I lowered the voltage
a little bit too far it was at one point
three four three and the system crashed
after about 10-15 minutes a game play so
we had to actually scalp the voltage
slightly to 1.35 and you can see here
that we are getting back to that sort of
86 87 degrees Celsius range which again
isn't ideal so what this means is
whether you have a 105 watt TDP 2700 X
or a 65 watt TDP 2700 if you're clocked
at the same speeds you will get around
the same temperature
and you'll need about the same amount of
thermal dissipation in order to run that
CPU effectively I think what we should
do is not down clock it but just rather
lower our overclock 3.8 gigahertz and
and see what kind of voltage and
temperature we can get away with that
all right
3.8 gigahertz on all cores hold on these
guys are killing my vibe sorry officer
so 3.8 gigahertz on all cores sorry dude
you made me do it
1.3 volts and we're rock solid stable I
was doing some stability testing within
a de Ida 64 and wouldn't you know it our
temperatures have gone down by about
seven degrees C we are now floating at
seven eight seventy eight point nine
we'll call it a flat 79 I was secretly
deep down I think I was secretly hoping
for anything below ADC and we've just
barely made that mark so this is
something I could live with especially
because the amount of performance drop
off you'll see in-game for most titles
going from four to three point eight
gigahertz is gonna be pretty
insignificant maybe one to three percent
five percent at most all in all these
are probably the final settings that
I'll be using for as long as I have this
computer speaking of computers have you
ever considered using the computer to
build a website with Squarespace
Squarespace is a great platform that I
actually use to build and run my
merchandise store although the sky is
really the limit for creating your
online presence even if that online
presence is just a bunch of cat memes
there's also a lot of nifty built-in
marketing tools and analytics so you can
look at your data and be like I'm
crushing it or I'm getting crushed by it
and I should really switch it up
creating website on Squarespace is super
easy so I've never run into any issues
but if I did it's good to know that I
could always hit up they're incredibly
helpful and responsive 24/7 customer
support
they've even won awards for being well
incredibly helpful in responsible head
to squarespace.com for a free trial and
when you're ready to watch go to
squarespace.com slash bit wit for 10%
off your first purchase of a website or
domain that's gonna do it for now guys
thank you so much for tuning in let me
