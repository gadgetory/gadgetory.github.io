still at the forefront of the gaming
experience delivering raw performance
and functionality unparalleled by other
devices at the core of each PC is a
processor or CPU that carries out
billions of instructions per second to
make everything tick for a computer part
with such an important job that lives in
millions of people's homes it's
surprising that only two companies in
the world manufacture desktop CPUs those
companies are Intel and AMD and they've
been waging war for ages for the last
decade or so
intel has dominated the cpu market with
their competitor bringing little to the
table over the years a lack of
competition slowed the growth of the PC
gaming industry with Intel rolling out
increasingly lackluster products while
keeping their best tech hidden perhaps
awaiting the day when AMD would rise
again and disrupt the market bringing
innovation back into the hands of
consumers that day came in March of 2017
when AMD launched their family of first
generation rising processors a flexible
platform strong budget offerings and the
ability to tear through varied workloads
with more cores made the chips an
appealing option filling in the gaps of
their rivals product stack this marked
an exciting turning point for the
industry but many folks were still
disappointed by rise uns gaming
performance where Intel remains supreme
one year later AMD launched their second
gen rise in series based on the same DNA
as its predecessor this improved gaming
performance slightly further increasing
the value proposition of Verizon but
Intel's Core processors were still the
top choice for gamers chasing maximum
performance that brings us to today with
AMD launching their third-generation
Rison 3000 series CPUs built from the
ground up on a whole new 7 nanometer
architecture that aims to take the most
lethal shot at Intel in over a decade
it's a moment in computing history that
we've anticipated for so long and today
we find out if it was worth the wait
bang the road you finally shut up with a
stupid intro are you talking out of your
butthole cuz your face correcta ass get
to the point show the benchmark my
nipples are tingling with anticipation
are you done
the Rison 3000 you grow some bows a
Greek boy this video is brought to you
by the Corsair hydro x-series
experienced best-in-class performance
and beautiful aesthetics with a brand
new family of custom water cooling
hardware quality construction perfect
fitment and next level engineering come
together to give enthusiasts a cool
quiet and breathtaking solution for the
rig of your dreams click on the link
below to learn more
oh I'm sorry alright
I had to kick Lyle out of the room he
was just way too much for me right now
sorry about that but he does kind of
have a point there's bound to be plenty
of in depth well made videos on Rison
3000 surfacing today so why make this
one of them I'm just gonna cut to the
chase with some quick testing setup
before diving into a large suite of
benchmarks that cover gaming streaming
and editing then we'll talk about the
results afterwards so holding to that
AMD kicked off their Rison 3000 series
with 5 new processors that launched
today the company also confirmed last
month that their super high-end 16 core
Rison 939 50 X will be launching in
September later this year for now we
have two mid-range Rison 5 SKUs to
high-end Rison 7 SKUs and the first-ever
Rison 9 part to hit the market I've
spent the last 3 days or so testing the
Rison 730 700 X Rison 930 900 X and
their competitors so that's what we
focused on today pricing is typically
what determines which CPUs from opposite
corners of the octagon get pitted
head-to-head and in this case the 3700 X
goes up against the Intel Core i7 9700 K
which is roughly 10% more expensive at
the time of filming while both chips for
8 cores the 3700 X has twice the number
of threads at its disposal as the 9700
Kail x hyper threading support however
it does ship with higher clock speeds
out of the box
AMD scores the lower TDP here although
it's well known by now that Intel's
advertised TVP is based on face clock
alone and should be taken with a grain
of salt anyway the Intel part lacks any
stock cooler while the 3700 X includes a
wraith prism RGB unit which is a nice
value add for its launch price of 329 US
dollars compared to the 9700 K at 365
you have about five hundred dollars to
spend on a CPU you might be considering
the rise in 939 hundred X or the core I
999 hundred K which is currently 2%
cheaper the 3900 exports 12 cores and 24
threads
crushing the core I nines 8 and 16
configuration albeit with slower Basin
blue squad frequencies understandably we
see a higher TDP on the 3900 X then it's
smaller risin 7 brethren which again is
hard to compare to Intel's marketing
spec like the 3700 X the risin 9 also
ships with a wraith prism RGB cooler and
launches at 499 dollars versus 489 for
the 9900 K here's a quick look at the
test systems for AMD we're using an MSI
x5 78 motherboard and 16 gigs of DDR for
3,600 memory overclocked with little
effort to 37:33 for my brief amount of
tinkering memory compatibility with
Rison 3000 is already chalking up to be
a hundred times better and more stable
than with previous generations for cpu
cooler we're using the asus rog ryojun
360 millimeter a i/o using the default
fan curve and will be booting off of a
two terabyte or as PCIe gen 4 nvme SSD
and exciting first as the x5 70 platform
marks the arrival of PCIe gen for
support our GPU is NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
2080 founders Edition running stock
while using an RT X 20 ATT I would have
shown more disparity in gaming
performance between CPUs I opted for a
more realistic approach in a world where
few gamers have over a thousand dollars
to spend on a video card
there's also bound to be no shortage of
Rison 3000 reviews using our TX 20 ATT
eyes if you're looking for them Intel
CPUs were tested on the gigabyte horas Z
390 extreme with 16 gigs of DDR 4 at
3400 bearing in mind that Intel CPUs
don't benefit from high memory frequency
in most applications like Rison chips do
the system uses the same cooler GPU and
power supply is the AMD test bed but
boots off a WD black SN 750 PCIe gen3
SSD Windows 10 Pro on build 1903 and
GeForce wickel driver for thirty eight
six four onions with that out of the way
let's talk benchmarks a couple polls
confirmed that the vast majority of you
would use the new high-end Rison chips
for gaming and content creation like
streaming and editing and that you
mostly gaming at 1920 by 1080 and 2560
by 1440 so those are the workloads and
resolutions I've tested in today none of
the CPUs were manually overclocked
however multi-core enhancement was
enabled on both systems motherboards
multi-core enhancement or MCE applies a
factory overclock of sorts that can
potentially make the chips operate out
of spec the MCE setting is enabled by
default on both of these boards so the
results you're about to see most closely
reflect the performance of a bone-stock
plug-and-play experience with the given
Hardware ambient temperature was 22
degrees Celsius or 72 Fahrenheit so
right out of the gate we see the risin
family topping the charts and fire
strike extreme even if it is by a small
margin the 3900 X brings home the
highest overall score followed by the
3700 X but the Intel part's trailing
behind the best graphics core however
goes to the 9700 K the 9900 K
practically ties the 3900 X's graphics
core and its own bloodlines main score
adding to the somewhat in conclusiveness
of this test in particular once again
the 3900 X takes the top overall score
and time spot this time followed by the
9900 K then the 3700 X with the 9700 K
in dead last by quite a bit the 3900 X
also leads with the graphics core while
the remaining skews Duke it out and land
just a few points apart our first full
title tested is ashes of the singularity
at 1080p and here we see Intel pull
ahead by a whopping 13% an average frame
rates and even more so with one-percent
lows as expected the gaps close a bit at
14:40 P as we become more GPU bound but
Intel retains its lead especially the
9900 K with a 7% uplift over its
competitors battlefield 5 a 1080p show
similar results but the difference isn't
quite as extreme here in AMD seems to be
holding fast
Rison 3000 promised IPC improvement
appears to be at work here keeping the
path clear for the monstrous RT X 2080
echoing the results at 1440p the Intel
chips take a modest lead approaching the
highly sought after 144 FPS mark doom
was the only game I did not test at
1080p due to both systems maxing out its
200 framerate cap at said resolution but
at 1440p we see all four contenders
neck-and-neck and average frame rates
although something kind of funky is
afoot with our 1% lows the 9900 K was
technically the best and worth
forming chip in this regard but
sometimes benchmarks are just funny that
way since I feel bad for taking away
that 1080p slide I threw in doom at 4k
to make things right this is the only 4k
gaming test today though so don't get
used to it again very comparable results
here which is a given for this
resolution with our GPU handling much of
the legwork GTA 5 is a very CPU
intensive game so it's great for this
kind of testing the 9900 Kay takes a 9%
lead over the 3900 X and average frame
rates while the 9700 K enjoys a hefty
15% bump over the 3700 X GTA 5 does a
great job at leveraging multiple threads
but having 16 of them is probably
overkill and ultimately it's Intel's
wicked IPC that has this round in the
back
the 9900 quenette's 6% more frames than
its rival at 1440p while the 9700 K
continues thrashing the 3700 X this time
by 10% we see a brief role reversal in
the Resident Evil 2 remake with the 3900
X delivering 3% more frames on average
and the 3700 X having some revenge on
the core i7 by about 5%
oddly enough Intel steals back the crown
at 1440p as if only to let AMD taste
victory for a single fleeting moment now
the shadow of the Tomb Raider built-in
benchmark kept reporting a minimum frame
rate of zero FPS for all CPUs so this
isn't the best slide by any means you
might say it's rather average still we
can see the 9900 K and 9700 K are 6% and
9% faster than their direct competitors
respectively with high resolutions being
the great FPS equalizer for CPUs we see
a stalemate begin to form at 1440p at
this point we can switch gears to
professional workloads I tried my best
to keep my workstation tests as
realistic and practical as possible in
order to give you an idea of how the
hardware might perform in real world
situations for my streaming benchmark I
ran GTA 5 on the streamer system at
1440p based on the poll results you guys
gave earlier the game was streamed out
to twitch at 1080p 60 frames per second
with a 5,000 kilobits per second bitrate
as per the platform's recommendation for
that resolution and framerate
lucky for all four of our contenders OBS
reported zero dropped frames for all and
our hypothetical viewers on the
receiving end enjoyed equally smooth
playback of similar quality across the
board as you might expect the results
are more varied on the host side with
the end
chips delivering 13% more frames on
average to the streamer Cinebench is an
exciting test because it's the first
time we get to see the 3900 X spread its
wings this is what it was built for and
what it does best with a multi-threaded
score that's 42 percent higher than the
9900 K and 88 percent higher than the
9700 K the 3900 X is a computing
monstrosity partly thanks to its higher
thread count the risin 7 part is no
slouch either
the 9900 K barely beats the
significantly cheaper 3700 X by just
four percent and the 3700 X crushes the
9700 K by 27 percent single threaded
scores are grouped much closer together
with the 9900 k leading by about 1.6
percent over its direct competitor and
the 9700 K which sees a 2.5 percent bump
over the 3700 X hand brake is a great
rendering benchmark because it leverages
all threads typically at 100%
utilization here the 3900 X renders a
10-minute 4k clip 11% faster than the
9900 K and 9% faster than the 9700 K
which surprisingly bests its
hyper-threaded Ally the 3700 X takes
about 8 percent longer to finish than
the rise in 9 part but renders up to 4
percent faster than both Intel CPUs it's
not a huge lead but still impressive
given its lower price our first encoding
test in Premiere Pro Creative Cloud
renders a 10 minute 4k timeline of
footage that includes color correction
effects and video transitions to help
tax the system this time the 99 hundred
K barely edges out the 3700 X and
renders much faster than the 9700 K but
trails behind the 3900 X which does the
job nearly 7 percent faster I also ran a
second rendering test and premiere just
to see how things hold up with gameplay
footage overlaid with the shrunken piece
of video where a streamer might be
displayed twitch streamers often cut
together highlight reels of their
streams for their YouTube channels so
this seemed like a handy test to include
the 10 minute clip was rendered at 1080p
60 frames per second which is pretty
standard for this type of content here
we see the same ranking play out as the
last slide although here the 3900 X is
just 2% faster than the 9900 K while
being 11.6 percent faster than the 9700
K it's also about 7% faster than the
3700 X which is just 5.3 percent slower
than the 99
kay when it comes to rendering the 3900
X is the definitive breadwinner whereas
the 9700 K seems to be the weakest link
of the bunch
the 9900 K and 3700 X seem to trade
blows in this category which is an
accomplishment for the significantly
cheaper risin seven part now I made this
next multicam test with serious editors
in mind the objective is to playback
three 4k clips simultaneously at various
playback speeds and record the number of
dropped frames after one to three
minutes depending on the speed I worked
on dozens of multicam projects in my day
and there's nothing worse than trying to
scrub through several clips at once only
to have them chug into a choppy mess at
1x real-time speed our 9700 K is the
only skew that drops frames 163 in fact
which causes the playback to stutter
consistently at 2x all CPUs drop frames
like they're hot but the 9700 K does so
poorly the playback is too fragmented to
edit comfortably while the 3900 X drops
the least amount of frames at 2x and
higher the 3700 X and 9900 K are so
close behind that perceptible playback
smoothness between these three cpus is
indistinguishable even a NEX playback
looks beautiful on each of these
high-end processors except the 9700 K
it's worth pointing out that the 9900 K
and the 3700 X are rubbing up against
each other again and should probably get
a room at this point now in my testing
today I did not find the task demanding
enough to show the full benefits of X
570s PCIe gen 4 standard but it is
something editors should factor into
their buying decision and do more
research on if they plan on needing
superfast nvme storage for things like a
que editing and other extreme workflows
for the average prosumer making YouTube
videos or low-budget productions
existing PCIe gen3 nvme drives are still
insanely fast now that we've covered all
the data which CPU should you buy as
usual it boils down to your budget and
what kind of workloads you plan on
running let's first address gamers who
aren't concerned with doing any other
intensive tasks besides gaming looking
back at Rison 720 720 700 X gaming
benchmarks the new Rison series has
roughly cut the performance gap between
Intel in half a significant jump over
last gen that puts rising 3,000 hot on
the heels of big blue
having said that it's evident that Intel
is still the gaming champ and still the
choice for enthusiasts looking to max
out their frame rates especially users
with extremely high end video cards like
the RT X xx atti as the higher IPC will
help these GPUs reach their full
potential if this applies to you and the
only intensive task you're doing with
your system is gaming I would strongly
recommend the 9700 Kay over the 9900 K
due to its significantly lower price and
the fact that there's virtually no
difference in gaming performance between
the two like the 9900 K the 3900 X is a
bad value if gaming is your only agenda
because it's more expensive and performs
worse in games than the 9700 K compared
to the 3700 X the 9700 K is up to 15%
faster possibly more in certain titles
not tested here but the 3700 X is still
a viable gaming only chip if you're
trying to stretch your budget since it's
a bit cheaper than the core i7 and it
includes a cooler combine that saves you
roughly 60 bucks that you can pocket or
put towards a faster graphics card for
example it has to be said that like all
rise in 3000 SKUs the 3700 X also
benefits from a scalable a m4 platform
that's backward and forward compatible
with existing and future rise in CPUs as
long as AMD continues making good on
their promises this simplifies and
lessens the cost of upgrading processors
down the line and is worth considering
in your buying decision the a m4
platform also supports PCIe gen 4
although currently it's a feature that's
less beneficial to gamers than it is to
content creators and therefore should
not be given as much weight for an
exclusive gaming machine from a gamers
perspective the 3700 X delivers a better
overall value than the 9700 K with its
lower price flexible platform and bonus
ads on the same token the 9700 K offers
the better gaming experience and will
allow current and next gen top-tier GPUs
to deliver more frames to the screen
moving on to users who plan to game and
stream with their PCs are 1080p 60fps
test proves that all the CPUs provided
an equally smooth stream with 0 dropped
frames the deciding factor then comes
down to gaming performance on the
streamer side which clearly favors our
Intel SKUs if you're like most streamers
targeting 1080p 60fps the 9700
is technically the strongest option
right now since it delivered higher
frame rates than both Rison ships and
it's much cheaper than the 9900 K and
3900 X that being said it technically
has the worst multi-threaded performance
here meaning it's probably less equipped
to handle streaming for the long-haul
than any of these CPUs it's difficult to
say what the streaming landscape will
look like one or two years from now and
beyond so while the 9700 K is
multi-threaded performance is adequate
for most streamers today it'll likely
begin showing its age in the face of
higher streaming demands before the 9900
K and its competitors as mentioned the
9900 K won't improve your framerate much
but it's higher thread count makes it a
smarter choice for serious streamers
than the 9700 K the 3900 x1 up to the
9900 K in multi-threaded performance
which should give it a longer lifespan
as a streaming CPU but falls behind in
gaming so you'll want to choose one of
these chips based on which workload you
prioritize 9900 K for gaming 3900 X for
streaming like the 9700 K the 3700 X is
a viable budget option for streamers but
for different reasons it trades in some
gaming performance for higher
multi-threaded performance which might
not be needed now but it does make the
part more future ready for streaming if
you have less than four hundred dollars
to spend on a streaming CPU you'll have
to decide if you want higher frame rates
today or better streaming tomorrow now
if we had video editing and rendering to
the picture for a fully fledged content
creation workflow the multi-threaded
performance of the 3900 X makes it the
clear winner with faster render times
and fewer dropped frames than the 9900 K
it also has support for PCIe gen 4
should that be required and the option
to easily upgrade to the 16 core Rison
939 50 X down the line
however the 3900 X should last most
users a very long time as it's a beast
of a chip and the best damn value of any
dodeca core CPU ever the 3700 X's
editing prowess is comparable to the
9900 K but it's nearly $200 cheaper and
can also leverage PCIe gen for making it
a much better value for this use case
the 9700 K should be avoided here due to
with slower render times and inability
to handle more intensive editing work
close finally if you could care less
about gaming and editing is your sole
objective only the risin ship should be
considered as they perform better than
their direct competitors for roughly the
same price or cheaper of course serious
buyers should also consider high-end
desktop platforms like Scylla X and
thread refer to but if those are too
pricey or overkill for your needs
choosing between the 3700 X and 3900 X
is a decision best left up to your
wallet as both parts offer great price
to performance so there you have it at
the end of the day each of these
processors fulfills different needs for
different users it'd be easy if we had
one chip to rule them all
but we already kind of had that when
Intel was on top and unchallenged by AMD
for so many years before Rison came
along and that wasn't fun
Rison 3000 improves upon the platform's
existing pillars of strength further
leveling the playing field to a degree
we haven't felt in a very long time for

CPU market is here to stay but let me

apart from that guys feel free to toss a
like before you go and feel free to
consider becoming a member of the
channel for five bucks a month where
you'll get custom badges emojis and
other pointless things that are just so
fun for some reason also be sure to
subscribe to the channel for more tech
stuff on the way thanks again for
watching have a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
