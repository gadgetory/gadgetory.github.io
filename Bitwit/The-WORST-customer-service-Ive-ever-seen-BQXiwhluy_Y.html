guys the progress that we've made so far
on the flooring it was about halfway
done at the time you could sort of see
it getting pieced together but it was
really hard to sort of visualize what
the finished product would look like
well the flooring is now completely done
I'm actually in the backyard right now
wiping sauce you could probably hear
fiddling around back there hi honey
she's already in the house how's it look
really good
okay I'm gonna verify that in just a
moment we also redid pretty much all the
trim around the doors and the entryways
in the house as well but remember the
paint is not done yet so we still have
to paint all the walls and all the trim
in the house we have a guy coming in
later this week to do that so I can't
wait any longer let's check it out oh
snap dang the baseboards look pretty
good Wow holy moly it looks like a
completely different room Wow look at a
trim that's some sexy trim right there
very clean they did a good job clean
lines very clean lines oh it's coming
together I can't wait to get some
furniture in here to absorb some of the
sound all right so this is the laundry
area looking pretty good the kitchen
looks awesome and the flooring kind of
matches the cabinets we are gonna change
we're actually gonna shop around for
some new hardware change out these knobs
where I can install them yet until the
painting is all done but we're gonna go
shopping around for some hallway hallway
this is the first oh we turn this light
switch on kind of out of the wall right
now so this is the first bit weight room
and I suppose the first production room
where the shootings gonna happen this is
gonna be so much nice going to be
shooting on on a flat surface as opposed
to carpet I mean using a tripod on
carpet is is not fun at all so there
should be a lot better mask the bedroom
additionally all the closets and all the
bedrooms have this weird like
pre-installed shelving that looked
really ugly we removed all of that as
well we took out the closet doors
because we want to replace those so it's
just kind of like a nice big open space
for now makes the room look a lot bigger
you can see they continued the flooring
all the way into the closets too and
Alena here this is the Super Mario room
makes the room look a little bit
brighter as opposed to the dark green
blue carpet I was in here before very
nice also check this out remember the
horrible wallpaper by the entryway that
looked like Christmas crap
completely gone it's just a regular ngon
hideous wall now I remember the giant
mirror wall that was really bad feng
shui and letting all of our positive
energy out the door that's gone too
demo guys did a pretty good job on that
well I'm pretty happy with how it looks
so far I think once the pages end it's
really gonna take it over the edge it's
gonna be nuts we have a lot of cool
stuff to do today though where is it
where is it where that's way over here
look what I got we got a nest we're
gonna install this today huh oh wife
your sauce and I are gonna demo this
candidate out too because it's just
gonna awkward and takes up a lot of
airspace it should be pretty easy to get
rid of I think there's just a couple
screws in there that we have to take out
and then it should hopefully just pop
out of place and not land on my head you
know I think this calls for a
celebratory beer oh wait we only have
one left
wait wait there might be there might be
one more Corona you're in luck Cheers
to the house wants to demo this first
first rule of order same thing all right
sounds cooler when you say demo we're
gonna demo the hell out of this thing
get the jackhammer that's that's the
right tool for this job right what what
you gonna pull out of your purse that we
could possibly need for demoing this
cabinet stick of gum little maxi pads
Wow how did you get a screwdriver now
I'm actually impressed
you sure did that's what she said just
like literally one in the background as
you're saying that if only we had a
get that ladder honey look at those
little muscles look at him go
you know I got to carry this camera all
day so you don't want to feel my pain
now that going here is so good we should
do some burps pretty good
what was that almost killed one of them
no that was at least two feet okay it's
all about volume with this one okay I'll
give you going
solid age on that appetizing note let's
get lunch all right it's lunchtime
time to eat the good food who couldn't
decide between sushi and shabu shabu so
we're getting both
he Home Depot that's what it says right
he home depot cuz I mean you think the T
at the end is silent why isn't the T at
the beginning silent the English
language doesn't make any sense
excuse me do you know where the hardware
knobs are do you work here too either of
you work here I'm looking for hardware
knobs excuse me do you speak English
habla English okay could you could you
at least call someone who can speak the
language or at least help me out please
come on guys why are you why are you
running to the break room I can see
you're clearly on your shift
if anyone can just this is ridiculous
anyone is anyone seeing this the
customer service here has really gone
downhill oK we've got options but the
Dimond one look at this one this one
just looked like a booger you know like
the color what if we spray-painted them
not a spray-paint things I've been
spray-painting radiators all day this
one's kind of brass why he saw selects
the brass ones is this considered brass
which brassy oh I know that look that's
the I don't see anything I like look and
we're not gonna get anything today all
right we're back home we got an
uninstall all of the curtains all the
blinds and unscrew anything that's in
the walls that shouldn't be so the nuns
in the way of the painters get here
ready to do this
that's a mom screw
oh good alright let's check out the nest
this is the nest thermostat by the way I
don't know if I mentioned that earlier
but after reading all the reviews on
this thing and seeing what it can do
especially save you money in the long
run potentially we figured it might be a
good investment so we got the copper
color comes in I think three or four
flavors we like copper because you know
thermally conductive and then in the box
the rest of the box we have I'm sure
instructions okay interesting this looks
like it connects to the back of your
nest we've got some mounting screws and
it looks to be a tool almost like an
egg-shaped tool but it's a flathead on
the end there and it's multi-tool so
you've got Phillips head as well
more mounting screws and you get this
mounting plate which is kind of like a
backplate for your nest if you want to
use it just I don't know why you would
it looks so much cleaner without it I'm
probably not gonna use it unless I
absolutely have to okey-dokey so give me
like five minutes to read the
instructions download the app and then
we'll get installing okay step one for
installation switch off the power step
two remove the cover of the old
thermostat let's get this old timer off
of here oh but that came off a little
too easy and then it looks like we need
need to unscrew this really quick
getting kind of laid out and now that we
don't have power wipey sauce is
assisting me with the light thanks honey
alright is the worst screwdriver in the
world Oh
alright next step take a photo of your
thermostats wiring we totally forgot to
do that but I think it's pretty
self-explanatory you can see all the
screws are labeled with their
appropriate color G for green Y for
yellow and so forth so no big deal there
make sure you do not have a high voltage
system if your old thermostats labeled
120 or 240 volts has stranded wires or
thick wires with wire nuts your system
is high voltage and not compatible
okay that seems pretty low voltage I'm
gonna say not high voltage loosen the
screws to remove jumper wires one step
ahead yeah do any of your wires have two
labels nope which of these wires does
your thermostat use why w rh r c ki
how's it next label the wires as shown
using the stickers in the box here we go
okay I'll labeled up disconnect and
remove your old thermostat yeah we did
that
attach the nest thermostat base pulling
the wires through the middle you got it
wiping
yeah well bubble mark where the screws
will go using the bubble levels make
sure the thermostat is straight don't
use a drill as it could damage the base
what do you do it's not - okay change of
plans I didn't want to have to do this
but we're gonna have to bust out the
trim plate because I think what's
happening is this screw either screw is
hitting steel at a certain point and
can't go any further without stripping
so that's what she said but if I use the
trim it actually puts a little bit more
space between this little wall unit and
the wall itself meaning we probably
won't reach steel all the way so it
gives us just enough buffer doesn't look
quite as clean in my opinion but if it
gets the job done I'm gonna bet all
right we finally got it on it's all nice
and straight there is a bit of residue
from the last thermostat but one thing
the painters in here that
quickly catch that up so we're ready for
wiring all right this is boring stuff
give me a second to wire it's all on to
the next step which is mounting the
actual thermostat ha looks like we've
got power I see a winking LED right
there it's starting switch power back on
oh it's so nice to have you back like
lutein you set up on the thermostat
English we can do it we could just be
adventurous and go Espanola okay NESTA's
all set up and ready to go whatever
temperature you sew it to it'll tell you
exactly how long it will take for it to
get to that target which is pretty nice
but that's a little too warm let's go to
75 yeah we did it we installed the nest
thermostat so we just rolled into our
favorite Mexican place and we
coincidentally came here on a Tuesday
where they have Taco Tuesday an actual
taco bar dollar 75 tacos
oh yeah we got to do the taco bar I lie
to you every day about how much I hate
you because I really love you oh yes we
are living the good life marks we don't
call them marks ever again it's terrible
it's a terrible nickname wow you got a
hold method worked out there how is it
the best thing you ever tasted pretty
damn close though what is the best thing
you've ever tasted you are so full of it
it's impossible it's a loaded question
sometimes it really boils down to it's
true it's like why you could never
answer like what your favorite movie or
song is right it's all context I think I
have discovered what my favorite song
okay favorite childhood song wishes what
that is a classic I feel like that's
still your favorite song on repeat until
you die
I really do did we get tableside guac we
anything we should we don't even need
knives look at how he chops it with a
fork and spoon whiten knives even exist
without a sedan throw yes please
everything yeah oh yeah it's all going
in my mouth performance are right here
because even like smoothing it out he's
laying a brick house the tableside block
does it taste as good as he made it look
you're free tequila shot Cheers let's go
home for real now you working on your
latest novel you are coloring a
jellyfish well aren't jellyfish white
isn't it already done I feel like you're
just making your life more difficult
already anatomically accurate do you
think that coloring is soothing
I think muscle relaxers are soothing
coloring is children and it was soothing
are you saying margaritas are like
coloring I'm not seeing a point in here
so I'm gonna cut it off the vlog hey
guys I'm literally in bed because it's
it's only 9:00 p.m. I mean we're old
people so wifey sauce is coloring so
maybe she's a little bit younger than I
am at heart I'm ready to call it a night
so thanks for watching the vlog toss
like that if you'd read it you know
whatever here's my boy
it's fun just to look at something that
has a lot of texture or has like a
pattern because then you do start to see
you know different faces or animals kind
of drugs are you taking coloring book
taking the color on both drugs strongest
Rosie yeah
yo bro this is called coloring book you
take one of these rabbits have 35,000
colors in them jellyfish are more than
white it's madness what if the point is
to color outside the lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
