quite a bit of computer hardware here at
the office probably a bit too much
hardware it's becoming a bit of a
problem so lately we've been trying to
find a way a fun and creative way to
give some kind of breadth of fun and
creative way to give some of it back to
you guys and what we've come up with is
a hidden camera game show where we give
one random stranger a chance to win a
high-end gaming PC like this one in fact
we already have our first victim
contestant his name is Dale and he's
meeting us up in 15 minutes
at a public location he actually thinks
that he's on his way to pick up a case a
computer case through Craigslist when in
fact he's in for a little bit more than
he bargained for so we should probably
need him up right now the H 500 I from
NZXT carries a small footprint without
compromising on features like flexible
hardware configurations a removable
radiator bracket for easy installation
and stellar cable management for a
tidier system Gaiman style with the
tempered glass side panel integrated RGB
lighting and a built-in cam powered
smart device to manage your lighting and
fans do more with less in the H 500 I
click the link below to learn more
Gail hey how's it going thanks thanks
for meeting me here hey I really
appreciate you coming out here but I
have something to confess
my name's not actually John and you are
currently on a hidden-camera game show
where you have the opportunity to
potentially win a $1,500 gaming PC right
here on the spot if you can answer five
tech questions correctly it'll only take
a couple minutes of your time would you
want to give it a shot sure it's got a
rise in 720 700 X GTX 1080i and we have
a series if you lose you can still buy
the case absolutely all right so we have
our first contestant ever this is
actually the pilot episode so I guess
you're the guinea pig I hope you're okay
with that all right so I just wanna
quickly ask you how tech savvy would you
say you are by today's standards video
okay well these are fairly mediocre
questions so you might be in luck they
are multiple choice as well I'm gonna
give you the multiple choice answers to
the first question the case that you
actually came here to buy that you
thought you were gonna buy was a fractal
design case I'm curious to know how much
you actually know about the manufacturer
themselves which of these components
does fractal design not manufacture
power supplies liquid coolers keyboards
or fans
and I go with keyboards keyboards is
that your final answer
oh no did I get to look at this build
first
it probably won't give you any clues but
yeah I'm gonna go that is correct
you have moved on to question number two
the term push-pull typically indicates
the fans are mounted on both sides of
what piece of hardware is it radiator
video card memory or power supply
radiator absolutely that is I might be
out of it might be out of a really nice
system in a moment here ladies and
gentlemen question three what does the
acronym USB stand for haha I wrote an
article on this and she though I called
it the universal Saviour bus because
stuff didn't really work until
I have a feeling you know this one
Universal Serial though that it doesn't
even need the card all right you're on
fire right now number four nvme SSDs no
larger than a stick of gum can typically
mount directly to the motherboard using
which physical interface and you
question number five the AMD Rison
thread Ripper 1920 X has how many cores
here's the card the 1920s yes you can
look it over
in 1920 I'm very sure it's still 16 is
that your final answer it's actually be
12 pours the 1950 x12
the 1950 X is the sixth one is the is
the 16 core you did good and hey you
know what just for just for playing the
game we're gonna give you that case for
free really just for showing up hey
thanks a lot Dale enjoy it yep have a
good one alright guys well that was
quite a rush I guess this is all to say
that if you happen to be purchasing
computer hardware on Craigslist in the
LA Orange County area you just might
find yourself on the next episode of
what what are we actually what are we
calling this alright guys you know what
to do let us know what you thought about
this pilot episode down in the comments
below and also maybe what we should name
it clearly we haven't figured that out
yet this system is still up for grabs
and maybe one of you lucky few who are
local in the area they have a chance to
win it someday soon so till next time
guys toss a like on this video if you
enjoy it get subscribe for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
