guys if you're watching this video it
means that the new 300 series of
graphics cards from AMD is finally here
and while I originally had a video
planned for the big release I
encountered some instability issues with
my r9 390 sample so instead I'll be
benchmarking two gtx 980ti
in sli so you're probably thinking what
business does Kyle have with two gtx
980ti s it's not like he's planning an
insane custom water-cooled build using
some of the most powerful hardware on
the market but that is where you would
be correct and for that you get a cookie
just kidding my cookie but yes it's true
in the next coming weeks I'll be posting
a series of videos about the epic build
which coincidentally will be my first
ever custom liquid-cooled system that
I'll be using for 4k gaming streaming
and video editing the PC will be built
on the x99 platform of course featuring
a 59 60 X 32 gigs of DDR 4 and you
guessed it two gtx 980ti s in sli that
on top of some sexy water-cooling
hardware from ek we'll all live inside
of fractal designs define s so now that
I've teased you a little and explained
why I have a pair of these powerful
graphics cards on hand I thought it'd be
fun to show off what they can do in the
realm of 4k gaming this should give me a
pretty good idea of the performance I
can expect with the finished build but
also keep in mind I'll eventually be
able to push the cards even further with
the chilly temps produced by liquid
cooling not to mention all the benefits
gained from the fast-approaching DirectX
12 API needless to say I'm just a little
excited but getting right down to
business I will once again be testing in
my 5820k system with 16 gigs of DDR 4 on
Windows 8.1 taking from the single card
video I did a few weeks back I dialed in
the same overclock settings boosting my
clock speed up to 14 60 megahertz
temperatures on both cards maxed out at
85 degrees Celsius which will seem scold
compared to the water-cooled temps in
the new system but that's enough
rambling for now here are the benchmarks
accompanied by more rambling starting
off with Metro last light the two-way
set up sees huge gains at 1080 and 1440
but just a smidge of improvement at 4k
and this was actually the game that
yielded the smallest amount of SLI
scaling at Ultra HD with hitman
absolution you'll notice that the single
card and two-way results at 1080 are
exactly the same as you might have
guessed this is due to a CPU bottleneck
with my 5820k that's right not even one
of Intel's six core enthusiast chips can
keep pace with the gtx 980ti s the
reason we're only seeing this issue at
1080 is because our sli setup is able to
render a boatload more frames per second
at this lower resolution so many in fact
that the CPU can't hold up its end of
the process fast enough it isn't until
we jump up to 1440 when the GPUs are
being taxed enough for the CPU to keep
up we see similar bottlenecking in GTA 5
as you can see here 4k is where both the
CPU and GPU operate as equals resulting
in a very nice performance boost at 72
frames per second higher resolution saw
a decent sli scaling in battlefield 4
with 35 to 37 percent gains while gaming
at 1080 only saw 25 percent increase
equating to a measly 193 frames per
second I should mention here that I ran
these tests on a 60 Hertz monitor and
occasional dips below 60 fps at 4k is
when we start to see some unattractive
screen tearing so much to the point
where you really start to see the value
in a variable refresh rate monitor
sporting Nvidia g-sync
or alternatively freesync if you're
rockin video cards from AMD
finally I ran Crysis 3 and was not
surprised to see the absence of any
bottleneck in here as the engine in this
game gives even the fiercest of GPU
setups a run for their money
this was the only game that couldn't top
40 FPS at 4k but disable the superfluous
anti-aliasing and you can easily hit an
average framerate in the mid-50s so
there you guys have it clearly today's
results indicate a smooth and a rich
gameplay experience that allows plenty
of headroom for cranking up the
eye-candy so far things are looking
pretty good for my custom water-cooled
build now I just got to get a g-sync
monitor to magically appear on that desk
back there stay tuned for more coverage
of my custom water-cooled build coming
really
and don't forget to toss me a like on

without some sauce Network thank you
guys for watching subscribe to the

see y'all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
