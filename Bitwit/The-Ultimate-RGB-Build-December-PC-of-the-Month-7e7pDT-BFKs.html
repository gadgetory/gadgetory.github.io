channel as we close out the new year
allow me to introduce you to the
December PC of the month I've been
planning this for several weeks now I'm
very excited that it's actually here and
that I get to build the damn thing
because it's been just in my mind for so
many weeks now and I just can't wait to
put it together
first off I wanted to really thank my
sponsors for this build NZXT Asus
Corsair as well as Joey from n source
guys if you haven't checked them out yet
link in the description below he does
some of the best cable sleeping I have
seen super clean cables for affordable
prices so go ahead check the link out
down below if you're at all interested
thank you Joey for pulling through on
this project the other thing I want to
say is that this doesn't really have too
much of a theme other than it's
Christmas there's it's there's a lot of
white because white reminds me of snow
and snow reminds me of the holidays
predominantly a white themed system with
a lot of RGB elements and if this video
seems a little bit rush it's because it
is I've actually got some family stuff
going on right after this build I
probably won't be back for several days
so this is my last chance like I have to
get this video done within a few hours
otherwise you guys won't see this build
until like way after Christmas and that
wasn't the intent so I'm sorry again if
this feels a bit rushed I have to say
Happy Holidays Merry Christmas or
whatever holiday you guys celebrate
hopefully you enjoy it with friends and
family if you celebrate any kind of
holiday at this time year then still
have a great day have a great week and
hopefully you guys have a Happy New Year
as well stay safe have fun love you guys
thank you so much for everything as the
year closes out there's so many thoughts
and you know lots of reflection going
through my mind and stuff but I always
go back to just being so grateful for
all of you guys so thank you I love you
all have a good one and enjoy the
time-lapse see you all in the next video
you
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
