lazier in every video today we are
building October's PC of the month holy
smokes it's already October what the
hell I'm gonna do for November's PC of
them turkey build the objective of
today's PC is to make a gaming rig that
looks as badass as possible in an all
silver themed aesthetic I don't do these
as often as maybe I used to but this is
going to be one of those vanity builds
that focuses heavily on the aesthetics
over the combination of parts or the
actual balance of the hardware itself so
bear that in mind before you leave a
comment like how could you spend so much
on LEDs and the case when you should
have been spending more on the GPU blah
blah blah that sort of thing I
completely get it and I agree I
understand but the objective of this
system really is for vain purposes
remember that there's not much logic to
looking pretty so on that note why don't
we go ahead and take a look at the parts
that we'll be using for today's build
especially since they're all creepily
sitting behind me and I'm kind of
worried and freaking out that they're
gonna do something yeah I'm looking at
you fans all right where do we begin
hmm let's begin with the case because
it's fricking huge this is the fan ticks
and through evolve
oh my god nurse it is a beautiful case
Dimitri from hardware conducts my good
pal and fellow tech tuber actually
awarded this case chassis of the year
for 2015 and I completely agree with him
it's a fantastic case but I've actually
never built in one before can you
believe it I've never reviewed this case
I built in the Mini ITX version of it
but never the full ATX chassis so I'm
very excited to build it today it is of
course rocking the very appropriate coat
of galaxy silver paints which i think is
going to look fantastic with everything
else involved here so excited about that
we forgot to over here we got the
graphics card this is the EVGA for the
win gtx 1070 now this is one of those
areas where you guys going to be like
cal you should have like got a way more
budget case and you should have got a
1080 why is this is seven and not an
eight stupid yeah I get it I get I
understand again the objective of this
build is not to be super balanced or
anything like that it's really just to
show off something that looks pretty
cool that being said though I would have
used GTX 1084 the win
in but my good old buddy old Paul is
borrowing it right now he was a County
today yeah sure Yomi hundred bucks she's
like nah man nah really I was like nah
man I'm joking keep it that's how we
talk to each other so yeah I'll be using
the 1070 it's a beautiful card it looks
exactly like the 1080 which is really
what concerns me for this build again um
sorry yeah it's gonna reduce wheat eight
gigs of gddr5 they already all that good
sort of stuff it's gonna be great for a
1440p whether talking 25 60 or 34 40 you
like the a serial predator minor over
there review coming soon moving on we've
got the msi z170a empower gaming
titanium motherboard and this is the
bastard that started it all folks I
wasn't even thinking my mind was
furthest away it could be from doing a
silver build until this came in the mail
MSI I just sent it to me didn't even ask
if I wanted it there was just showed up
on the doorstep and I was like dude suck
sir so I just knew that from looking at
it I had to do something with it because
apart from being a really high-end
premium gaming motherboard on the z170
platform good for overclocking whoa it's
also got this really unique sort of
shimmery silvery aesthetic coat all over
it on the heat sinks on the PCB on the
PCI slots everything is just coated in
beautiful silver so I thought you know I
got to take advantage of this somehow no
one's done it yet I don't think I don't
think link link me down below if someone
has so I think it's gonna be pretty cool
also for memory this is this is the
to get right here the Dominator Platts
you need some Dom Platts if you're going
to have a real silver motherboard in a
silvery build so this is from Corsair 16
gigs 3,000 megahertz
I believe yep 3000 you sorry the focuses
3000 says right there confirmed for
storage we've got a 2 terabyte WD black
for all of our games and stuff and media
and for our boot drive and other
applications we've got a crucial MX 200
SSD apart from being just a really good
budget drive it's also silver Hey so
we're gonna try to heat gun this label
off actually because labels are lame I
think all goes as planned I might stick
it right there at the front mounting
point at the bottom of the n3 we evolved
I think that'll look pretty sweet whoo I
forgot to mention it's tempered glass of
course of course it's tempered glass
Kyle of course it is how could I forget
so that's that's another
thing that I'm really excited about
because it's I think it's just going to
take it to a whole new level from a
cosmetic standpoint also we've got a CPU
of course this wouldn't really be a
build without one it's a core i5 6600 K
hey I've been using the CPU quite a lot
lately but it's it kicks ass so I'm
gonna keep using it also we've got the H
100 i GT XV 2 even though the box does
not save you - this is actually the v1
box is the 1.0 however I lost the box
for the v2 so I'm just using this box as
a placeholder but I've got the v2 over
there just chillin what's up B - he's
ready to go
I'll lubed up we've also got the EVGA
supernova 850 watt g2 L this is building
upon their older g2 model with the L the
L stands for LED or lighting or
luminance or something with that having
to do with light basically it's got some
LEDs some white LEDs coming out of the
connectors the power connectors
themselves that should look pretty cool
I'm not sure how much it's going to be
visible in our case here but I guess
we'll find out and maybe I'll stick the
camera deep inside this case is backside
to give you guys a look if we can't see
it from the front moving on we've got
some fans here these are Noctua fans
that we're going to be placing replacing
the case fans with as well as the fans
on the h100 eye so I'm not too a fans
you guys all you know them you love them
if they're good guys they're GG so we've
got two they're Redux or redo however
you want to say it you know tomato
tomahto
we've got two of the 120 s there NF s 12
bees at 1,200 rpms those are going to be
replacing the radiator fans again on the
cooler and then we've also got four 140
millimeter fans either these are the NFP
for teens 14 SS reduce 1500 rpm slightly
faster rpms however they're wider fans
they're larger blades so they will
probably not need to spin quite as fast
or as hard as the as the 12 hundreds
over there is the 120s and those are
gonna be again replacing the case fans I
think they are going to be so weeks also
they are featuring like a kind of gray
sort of gray color scheme very unique to
Noctua fans they're not the the nasty
brown ones that hardly match with
anything and I just ripped the box
that's cool but here's a look at the 120
the blade design is different from
between the the 120 in the 140 but I
think this looks sick this looks like a
fan that you would see in like a
an airplane hangar or something so
really excited to use these as well and
a couple more things couple more things
I'm gonna go back to the cables really
quick we've got I forgot to mention this
is a white LED strip that we've got from
cable Maude got a SATA connector on the
end it's magnetic I love these little
things cable Maude make some really good
ones they're actually a little bit
brighter than the BitFenix ones that I
have the alchemy 2.0 magnetic strips so
we're going to be sticking that in there
I think the white is going to really do
a nice job of illuminating all the
silver accents in our system here didn't
want to wash it out with any other
colors so white seems to be the way to
go and then last but certainly certainly
not least we've got some custom cable
sleeping here from my boy over at n
sources from Joey and if you guys
remember my man to build that I didn't
do too long ago I've actually since then
by the way named that build atlas / some
of your guys's suggestions after the
more portly robot from Portal 2 because
it looks kind of like him so thank you
guys for that suggestion so this is a
the same guy who did Atlas the cables
for Atlas has also done the cables for
this build as soon as I saw the results
from Atlas I hit him up immediately
after thinking of the idea for this
system and he was more than happy to
oblige got these here really quick guys
he does great work I'll put a link down
below and sourced dot net if you want to
check that out don't sleeve your own
cables it's a pain in the ass trust me
um so I think on that notes those are
all the parts that we're using holy
smokes I have nothing left to say here
so um guys I'm going to go ahead and
shut up now and get to work on this
thing so sit back relax enjoy the
time-lapse and I'll see you back after
it's all done
you
you
you
all right here she is folks ain't she a
beauty oh yeah put my wiener inside her
uh so here it is the build overall went
fairly smooth and I really like how it
turned out actually I think I say that
for every build that I do but it's true
I usually do like the builds that I did
I assemble but there were a couple
snacks so I'm gonna do some a little bit
different here you can see I've actually
taken control of the tripod here whoo
whoo so first off the biggest problem
that I had with this build was actually
getting the sticker off of the MX 200
here in the SSD actually the sticker
itself came off really easy with just a
little bit of a heat gun action but it
left this horrendous residue that took
me almost an hour to get off by hand I
almost gave up several times and was
just like screw it I'm just gonna use
the different SSDs so I could be silver
I don't care anymore
but I eventually got it off I went
through with it
and I'm so glad I did because I think
it's totally worth it it just looks
really nice it matches with everything
else and it just kind of pops it stands
out quite a bit without being too
distracting I just I'm really glad that
I went through with it the sticker on
the power supply went off no problem no
issues there and while you can't see any
of the LED action of the g2 L it is
visible from the other side because
there's tempered glass on both sides of
this chassis in case I forgot to mention
that earlier so that's really cool I'm
glad that feature doesn't go completely
unnoticed also not much to say about
motherboard and CPU cooler installation
the removable radiator bracket here on
the end to evolve ATX works exactly as I
thought it would it's super simple and
convenient to use allows you to kind of
install the motherboard and the radiator
simultaneously which was super cool the
cables here murdered aren't they
beautiful I mean I didn't really have a
WoW moment while building the system
until I installed these extensions so a
really happy that's Joey from end source
hooked it up again there's links in the
description below if you want more info
on where to get these beautiful cables
um geez what else to say here the knock
to offense are dead silent I mean I
haven't heard a damn peep out of them
it'll be interesting to do some load
testing with this thing in part two
because they're not like the super
premium not to a fans like the ones that
they're known for they're a bit more
budget oriented they're at a reduced
cost so I'm curious to see if they
perform just as adequately as those
premium fans but yeah it'll be cool to
see and let's see what else what else
what else what else oh oh yeah obviously
because there's tempered glass on both
sides I had to spend a little bit more
time with cable management I'm really
happy with how it turned out and
honestly it wasn't that much of a burden
because tidying up cables in the Evolve
ATX is super easy especially with the
power supply strap there's just tons of
room to tuck stuff under not to mention
all the tie-down points the velcro
straps things like that there's plenty
of space and whatnot so overall
everything looks super good
I'm super happy with it and stuff now I
have to figure out what where this is
gonna go or should i disassemble it I
hate disassembling rigs when they look
this beautiful it's just such a shame
but yeah on that note build success and
let's go ahead and close out this here
video alright guys that is going to wrap
it up for part one of October's PC of
the month be sure you stay tuned for
part 2 coming very soon where we do a
full system analysis of this rig
everything from acoustics to thermals to
of course gaming benchmarks also feel
free to let me know what you think of
this rig do you like it do you think
it's funny as hell leave me some
feedback of some sorts in the comments
below you can also toss me a like on
this video if you enjoyed it as always
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
more that subscribe for more tech stuff
coming at you really soon and I will see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
