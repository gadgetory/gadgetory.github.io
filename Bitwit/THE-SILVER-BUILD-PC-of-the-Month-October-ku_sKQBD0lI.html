lazier in every video today we are
building October's PC of the month holy
smokes it's already October what the
hell am I gonna do for November's PC of
the month
turkey build the objective of today's PC
is to make a gaming rig that looks as
badass as possible in an all silver
themed aesthetic I don't do these as
often as maybe I used to but this is
going to be one of those vanity builds
that focuses heavily on the aesthetics
over the combination of parts or the
actual balance of the hardware itself so
bear that in mind before you leave a
comment like how could you spend so much
on LEDs and the case when you should
have been spending more on the GPU blah
blah blah that sort of thing I
completely get it and I agree I
understand but the objective of this
system really is for vain purposes
remember that there's not much logic to
looking pretty so on that note why don't
we go ahead and take a look at the parts
that we'll be using for today's build
especially since they're all creepily
sitting behind me and I'm kind of
worried and freaking out that they're
gonna do something yeah I'm looking at
you fans all right where do we begin
hmm let's begin with the case because
it's fricking huge this is the fan --tx
and through evolve
oh mai gerd nurse it is a beautiful case
Dimitri from hardware conducts my good
pal and fellow tech tuber actually
awarded this case chassis of the year
for 2015 and I completely agree with him
it's a fantastic case but I've actually
never built in one before can you
believe it I've never reviewed this case
I built in the Mini ITX version of it
but never the full ATX chassis so I'm
very excited to build it today it is of
course rocking the very appropriate coat
of galaxy silver paint which i think is
gonna look fantastic with everything
else involved here so excited about that
we've forgot to over here we got the
graphics card this is the EVGA for the
win gtx 1070 now this is one of those
areas where you guys are gonna be like
cal you should have like got a way more
budget case and you should have got a
1080 why is this a seven and not an
eight stupid yeah yeah i get it i get i
understand again the objective of this
build is not to be super balanced or
anything like that it's really just to
show off something that looks pretty
cool that being said though i would have
used the gtx 1080
for the win but my good old buddy old
Paul is borrowing it right now he was a
town new 1080 yeah sure you owe me
hundred bucks she's like nah man no
really I was like nah man I'm joking
keep it that's how we talk to each other
so yeah i'll be using the 1070 it's a
beautiful card it looks exactly like the
1080 which is really what concerns me
for this build again um so yeah it's
gonna be pretty sweet eight gigs of
gddr5 VR ready all that good sort of
stuff it's gonna be great for a 1440p
whether you're talking 25 60 or 34 40
you like the a serial predator monitor
over there review coming soon moving on
we've got the msi z170a and power gaming
titanium motherboard and this is the
bastard that started it all folks I
wasn't even thinking my mind was
furthest away it could be from doing a
silver build until this came in the mail
I miss I just sent it to me didn't even
ask if I wanted it there was just showed
up on the doorstep and I was like mmm
sorry so I just knew that from looking
at it I had to do something with it
because apart from being a really
high-end premium gaming motherboard on
the z170 platform good for overclocking
whoa it's also got this really unique
sort of shimmery silvery aesthetic coat
all over it on the heatsinks on the PCB
on the PCI slots everything is just
coated in beautiful silver so I thought
you know I've got to take advantage of
this somehow no one's done it yet I
don't think I don't think link link me
down below if someone has so I think
it's gonna be pretty cool also for
memory this is this is the to get
right here the Dominator plants you need
some Dom plats if you're gonna have a
real silver motherboard in a silvery
build so this is from Corsair 16 gigs
3,000 megahertz
I believe yep 3,000 you sorry the
focuses 3,000 says right there confirmed
for storage we've got a 2 terabyte WD
black for all of our games and stuff and
media and for our boot drive and other
applications we've got a crucial MX 200
SSD apart from being just a really good
budget drive it's also silver Hey so
we're gonna try to heat gun this label
off actually because labels are lame I
think all goes as planned I might stick
it right there at the front mounting
point at the bottom of the end to evolve
I think that'll look pretty sweet oh I
forgot to mention it's tempered glass of
course of course it's Sanford glass Kyle
of course it is how could I forget
that's that's another thing that I'm
really excited about because it's
nothing it's just gonna take it to a
whole new level from a cosmetic
standpoint also we've got a cpu of
course this wouldn't really be a build
without one it's a core i5 6600 K hey
I've been using the CPU quite a lot
lately but it's it kicks ass so I'm
gonna keep using it also we've got the H
100 i GT XV 2 even though the box does
not say v2 this is actually the v1 box
is the 1.0 however I lost the box for
the v2 so I'm just using this box as a
placeholder but I've got the v2 over
there just chillin what's up V 2 he's
ready to go
I'll lubed up we've also got the EVGA
supernova 850 watt g2 L this is building
upon their older g2 model with the L the
L stands for LED or lighting or
luminance or something with that isn't
having to do with like basically it's
got some LEDs some white LEDs coming out
of the connectors the power connectors
themselves that should look pretty cool
I'm not sure how much it's going to be
visible in our case here but I guess
we'll find out and maybe I'll stick the
camera deep inside this case is backside
to give you guys a look if we can't see
from the front
moving on we've got some fans here these
are Noctua fans that we're going to be
placing replacing the case fans with as
well as the fans on the H 100 I so
Noctua fans you guys all know them you
love them if they're good guys they're
GG so we've got two they're Redux or
redo however you want to say it you know
tomato tomahto we've got two of the 120
s there n FS 12 B's at 1,200 rpms those
are going to be replacing the radiator
fans again on the cooler and then we've
also got four 140 millimeter fans either
these are the NFP for teens 14 s's
reduced 1500 rpm slightly faster rpms
however they're wider fans they're
larger blades so they'll probably not
need to spin quite as fast or as hard as
the as the 12 hundreds over there is the
120s and those are gonna be again
replacing the case fans I think they are
gonna be so wheat also they are
featuring like a kind of grey sort of
grey color scheme very unique to Noctua
fans they're not the the nasty brown
ones that hardly match with anything and
I just ripped the box that's cool so
here's a look at the 120 the blade
design is different from between the the
120 in the 140 but I think this looks
sick this is
a fan that you would see in like a an
airplane hangar or something so really
excited to use these as well and a
couple more things couple more things
I'm gonna go back to the cables really
quick we've got I forgot to mention this
is just a white LED strip that we've got
from cable mod I've got to see the
connector on the end it's magnetic I
love these little things cable mod make
some really good ones they're actually a
little bit brighter than the BitFenix
ones that I have the alchemy 2.0
magnetic strips so we're gonna be
sticking them there I think the white is
gonna really do a nice job of
illuminating all the silver accents in
our system here didn't want to wash it
out with any other colors so white seems
to be the way to go and then last but
certainly certainly not least we've got
some custom cable sleeving here
from my boy over at n sources from Joey
and if you guys remember my man to build
that I didn't do too long ago
I've actually since then by the way
named that build atlas / some of your
guys's suggestions after the more portly
robot from portal 2 because it looks
kind of like him so thank you guys for
that suggestion so this is a the same
guy who did Atlas the cables for Atlas
has also done the cables for this build
as soon as I saw the results from Atlas
I hit him up immediately after thinking
of the idea for this system and he was
more than happy to oblige got these here
really quick guys he does great work
I'll put a link down below and sourced
dot net if you want to check that out
don't sleeve your own cables it's a pain
in the ass trust me
I'm sorry think on that nope those are
all the parts that we're using
holy smokes I have nothing left to say
here
so um guys I'm gonna go ahead and shut
up now and get to work on this thing so
sit back relax enjoy the time-lapse and
I'll see you back after it's all done
all right here she is folks ain't she a
beauty oh yeah put my wiener inside uh
so here it is the build overall went
fairly smooth and I really like how it
turned out actually I think I say that
for every build that I do but it's true
I usually do like the builds that I did
I assemble but there were a couple
snacks so I'm gonna do some a little bit
different here you can see I've actually
taken control of the tripod here whoo
whoo so first off the biggest problem
that I had with this build was actually
getting the sticker off of the MX 200
here in the SSD actually the sticker
itself came off really easy with just a
little bit of a heat gun action but it
left this horrendous residue that took
me almost an hour to get off by hand I
almost gave up several times and was
just like screw it I'm just gonna use
the different SSDs so I could be silver
I don't care anymore
but I eventually got it off I went
through with it and I'm so glad I did
because I think it's totally worth it
it just looks really nice it matches
with everything else and it just kind of
pops it stands out quite a bit without
being too distracting I just I'm really
glad that I went through with it the
sticker on the power supply went off no
problem no issues there and while you
can't see any of the LED action of the
g2 L it is visible from the other side
because there's tempered glass on both
sides of this chassis in case I forgot
to mention that earlier so that's really
cool I'm glad that feature doesn't go
completely unnoticed also not much to
say about motherboard and CPU cooler
installation the removable radiator
bracket here on the end to evolve ATX
works exactly as I thought it would it's
super simple and convenient to use
allows you to kind of install the
motherboard and the radiator
simultaneously which was super cool the
cables here murdered aren't they
beautiful I mean I didn't really have a
WoW moment while building the system
until I installed these extensions so
really happy that's Joey from end source
hooked it up again there's links in the
description below if you want more info
on where to get these beautiful cable
um geez what else to say here the not to
offense are dead silent I mean I haven't
heard a damn peep out of them it'll be
interesting to do some load testing with
this thing in part two because they're
not like the super premium not to a fans
like the ones that they're known for
they're a bit more budget oriented
they're at a reduced cost so I'm curious
to see if they perform just as
adequately as those premium fans but
yeah that'll be cool to see yeah let's
see what else what else what else what
else
Oh oh yeah obviously because there's
tempered glass on both sides I had to
spend a little bit more time with cable
management I'm really happy with how it
turned out and honestly it wasn't that
much of a burden because tidying up
cables in the Evolve ATX is super easy
especially with the power supply strap
there's just tons of room to tuck stuff
under not to mention all the tie-down
points the velcro straps things like
that there's plenty of space and whatnot
so overall everything looks super good
I'm super happy with it and stuff but
now I have to figure out what where this
is gonna go or should I just assemble it
I hate disassembling rigs when they look
this beautiful it's just such a shame
but yeah on that note build success and
let's go ahead and close out this year
video all right guys that is gonna wrap
it up for part one of October's PC of
the month be sure you stay tuned for
part two coming very soon where we do a
full system analysis of this rig
everything from acoustics to thermals to
of course gaming benchmarks also feel
free to let me know what you think of
this rig do you like it do you think
it's Buckley's he'll leave me some
feedback of some sort in the comments
below you can also toss me a like on
this video if you enjoyed it as always
thank you guys for watching subscribe
for more yeah subscribe for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon and I
will see you all in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
