just waiting here in Lance's car waiting
for everybody to get the fast their
butts down the mountains you want to get
fast food after that that sounds
disgusting I sound whore I would not I
decide right now no fast food no we
can't get food Edsel you don't deserve
it coz you didn't make it to the top oh
I'm gonna ask Kyle about his wrinkly
feet during his MD that's disgusting
why would you do that because it's
awesome no one wants to see my or hear
about my wrinkly feet I want to hear
about them I want to see them you know I
don't want to see them I don't want to
hear them but you want to smell them
which one of your senses do you want to
tantalize my feet none of the senses
juicy mind they stimulate my mind the
sense of thought this is neat for this
food well I think we should wait firm to
but we should also just leave we should
totally before we we might just want to
depart in groups as people come down
rather than waiting for every car to be
full that I mean that makes more sense
right this guy's almost full so the
first person to get back down or the the
next person to get back down it's a
three revs they burned it we're in the
lightest car - mobile this isn't even
the lightest mobile I wish I had my car
here and you guys could enjoy the like
rotting food in it and stuff yeah it's
oh come on
really your video quality so clean you
can't take a rotting McDonald's
hamburger out of your car don't eat
McDonald's just has dirty plates all
over his car yeah like like ceramic
plates I don't think a ceramic plate has
ever even entered my car he may or may
not eat while he drives whoo flick on
the way to work wait what you don't want
to say I'll eat like cereal while I
Drive Manuel get cereal hi you should
you think about some disposable bowls
you see heap I had like not from a plate
for my dick like a whole pie and then
while you're eating pie he talked on
your phone I make very efficient use of
my driving time you ever killed anyone
in the car no I would just trip out if I
pulled up at a red light and saw the
dude next to me in his car yummy pie
the chance I don't know what I would do
what I do I would probably try to take a
picture I'll tweet it like look at this
dude evita's car that's exactly what I
do man
oh it was a really good pie it was worth
it probably was Ed's lawyer you a good
driver yeah yeah I didn't even mean
there should be a burden like Hartzell
just trumps everything else yeah unless
someone plays the black card oops
then everyone's screwed</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
