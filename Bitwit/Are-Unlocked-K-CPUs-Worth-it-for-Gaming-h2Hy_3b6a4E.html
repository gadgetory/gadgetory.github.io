Josh hey what's up man so look I know
that you said that the core 500 toaster
can fit full-sized video cards and AIO
liquid coolers but dude I can't even fit
the motherboard in the damn thing so
what's the deal what no dude I said the
core 5:30 is like the size of a toaster
what the hell are you doing right now
wait so if that's not the core 500
hippie who don't Barney 120 key don't
buy yet it opened up the core 500 from
fractal design provides top-class
cooling and supports full-sized hardware
and a compact design click the link in
the description to learn more bread
toasting only supported with AMD chips
what's up guys so if you're looking to
build a new gaming PC and your heart's
already set on an Intel Core processor
the next thing you might want to
consider is whether to spend the extra
cash on an unlocked case Q for those of
you newbies out there okay at the end of
an intel core cpu part number indicates
that the multiplier of that processor
has been unlocked
meaning it can be overclocked by the end
user to achieve clock speeds faster than
what's advertised on the box all in the
name of increased performance this
potential for extra performance comes at
a premium with unlocked CPUs typically
costing anywhere from five to ten
percent more than their locked core
counterparts plenty of synthetic
benchmarks show big gains from
overclocking Intel processors but when
it comes purely to gaming what
real-world performance gains can we hope
to see from CPU overclocking and does
that benefit warrant the premium price
of a case cue chip what makes this a
worthwhile discussion is that most games
these days most games these days are
heavily GPU dependent so putting the
money saved on CPU overclocking costs
towards a faster video card for example
might be a wise choice when it comes to
sheer gaming performance to investigate
the matter I ran a few benchmarks with
the core i5 6600 K at both stock
frequency to emulate a locked 6600 and
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz pushing the
limitations of the unlock chip also in
our testbed is the z170a gaming pro
motherboard from
I 16 gigs of g-scale ddr4 and a ZOTAC
gtx 980ti amp Edition running at stock
frequencies I'll test will run at 1080
1440 and 4k on Windows 8.1 so starting
with Metro last light at very high
settings we see our average FPS at 1080
jump from 103 to 111 when overclocking
which is a respectable 8% performance
increase from simply tweaking our CPU
however this boost begins to taper off
at higher resolutions which is a likely
indication of GPU bottlenecking now that
our gtx 980ti has its hands full
rendering those extra pixels our CPU
overclock is sending instructions faster
than the card can execute hence the
smaller impact on performance if we were
to throw in another 980ti for two-way
SLI
I'd imagined we'd once again be CPU
bound and see more mileage with our
overclock at these higher resolutions
oddly enough minimum frame rates
decreased from our boost but as you're
about to see that trend lives and dies
with this title in GTA 5 once again we
see more dividends from overclocking at
1080 and less payout as we go up the
resolution scale still we see a sizable
11% average FPS increase at 1080 and a
more modest gain at quad HD even more
exciting perhaps is the impact our
overclock has on minimum frame rates
here at 1080 we see a 52% increase quad
HD goes from the 30s to the 50s and even
4k receives a nice bump these higher
minimum frame rates can help produce
extreme FPS drops when using double
buffered vsync for example while
providing an overall smoother gameplay
experience so this is a big victory
point for CPU overclocking similar
results were achieved in hitman
absolution except we see little
difference in frame rates between 1080
and 1440 revealing a bottleneck with our
6600 K if the CPU could keep up with our
video card there's a fair chance we'd
see higher frame rates at 1080 even at
1440 the 980ti is drawing frames with
time to spare and this is exactly why
overclocking the CPU has a big impact on
performance here the one exception is 4k
where our video card finally gets to
slammed to benefit much from our CPUs
boost so what's to be gathered from all
these results well the hard data
suggests that CPU overclocking is
generally more effective at increasing
the average and minimum frame rates when
gaming at lower resolutions like 1080
where the GPU still has some breathing
room to process incoming commands at a
faster rate overall we saw an eleven
point seven percent increase in average
FPS when gaming at 1080 which definitely
builds a strong case for unlock chips
depending on the game CPU overclocking
can make an impact at quad HD too albeit
by a smaller amount as we saw 6.7%
increase across the board and average
frame rates in most cases if you're
gaming it either of these resolutions
it's hard for me not to recommend paying
the extra 10 or 20 bucks on a case cube
processor with just a 2.2 percent
average FPS boost at 4k don't expect
pushing your CPU to score you any mad
gains unless you're playing a heavily
CPU intensive game or have a powerful
multi-gpu set up looking at it from
strictly a price to performance
perspective you'd essentially be
spending five to ten percent more on an
unlocked CPU for just two percent more
performance in game and while that
doesn't sound very appealing at face
value there's more to overclocking than
peer gaming performance even if you're
not taxing your CPU with things like
encoding and rendering simply having the
opportunity to overclock is the best way
to learn more about it and the impact it
has on your system
apart from being a hands-on learning
tool overclocking can also be a fun
hobby or pastime that really becomes
more about the hardware's capabilities
than the user experience one person on
the Tom's Hardware forums phrased it
best by saying some people own a car to
get from point A to point B and some
people own a car to drive it but that's
pretty much gonna wrap it up for now
guys so let me know your thoughts on CPU
overclocking in the comments and don't
forget to toss me a like on this video

cooler shirts like this one in a brand
new material oh it's so soft and also
