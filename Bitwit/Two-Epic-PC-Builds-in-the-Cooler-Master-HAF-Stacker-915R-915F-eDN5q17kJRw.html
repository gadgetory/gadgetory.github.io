changes have been happening with my
channel my good pal Aaron started
interning for me twice a week and Paul
and I kicked off our weekly recurring
livestream awesome hardware
now while both of these grand events are
sure to drive the channel forward I've
realized that I'll need to invest in
some new resources in order for them to
truly flourish Aaron needs a new PC to
conduct online research and to help me
with YouTube stuff and Paul and I could
stand to benefit from having a dedicated
streaming system at my house for the
live show with my already small and
increasingly smaller room term studio
today's challenge involves building two
full computers in a heavily impacted
space another aspect to consider here is
that Aaron will only be coming over
twice a week to use his system while the
stream machine will be used even less
frequently than that
so I can't really justify taking up too
much real estate for two systems that
will be powered off most of the time to
make things more complicated the stream
box will have to be mobile enough to
haul between the rooms in my house in
case Paul and I decide to switch up our
set location for the stream now apart
from choosing the appropriate hardware
my strategy for accommodating all these
different factors revolves around the
chassis I'll be using for these rigs and
seeing as how this is a fairly unique
scenario it only seemed right to opt for
an equally unique case solution so today
I have called upon the power of my
friends at Coolermaster to help solve my
dilemma with their half stack er 915 r
and 915 F chassis z' the stackers unique
ability of seamlessly mounting on top of
each other allows me to cut my chassis
footprint in half while still having the
functionality of two entirely separate
systems though the 915 R and 915 F are
of the mini-itx variety they should
still be able to fit all the hardware I
need while also being mobile enough to
move around if needed
speaking of hardware there is a ton of
stuff to go over here so I'm just going
to quickly fire off the list of parts
but before I do I ought to mention that
some of these components are spare parts
I already had lying around my house
while others I had to purchase myself
coolermaster was also kind enough to
offer up some of their own hardware
which should come
the stacker is quite nicely so here we
go starting off with Aaron's workstation
PC I'll be building in the half 915 R
I'll also be repurposing my old yet
fully functional 2600 K along with an
Asus PhD 77 Ida Lux I bought on eBay now
Adobe Photoshop is probably the most
demanding application Aaron's going to
be running on the system so the CPU and
motherboard combo should be more than
adequate to see him through the system
will also sport eight gigs of Corsair
Vengeance ddr3 at 1600 a Coolermaster
sight on 120 XL liquid cooler ZOTAC GTX
960 Samsung 850 Evo 250 gig SSD and a
cooler master G 750 m finally for the
system is - 2 terabyte WD black hard
drives that I'm setting up in RAID one
this may also provide some clarification
as to why I chose the 915 R for this
build as it has a dedicated drive cage
at the front which has been omitted from
the 9:15 F in place of a power supply
mount you may have deduced by now that
the stream machine will go inside of the
9:15 F accompanied by a 4770k and asus
rog maximus 6 impact another poor
component I had collecting dust in my
studio also from the awesomesauce dust
collection is this 8 gigabyte kit of AMD
Radeon gamer series at the overkill
speed of 24 hundred megahertz moving on
to what's arguably the star of this
build is the Blackmagic intensity Pro
capture card that I'll be using to
stream weekly episodes of awesome
hardware yes I know this PCIe card will
take up the only PCIe slot on the
motherboard which leaves me without a
graphics card but keep in mind that I
will not be touching any games on this
system and then tells Quick Sync
technology on board the 4770k
should do a fine job at encoding all of
my incoming video signal next up is the
cooler master hyper 6 12 version -
another 250 gigs Samsung 850 Evo and the
cooler master G 550 m and those are all
the parts that we'll be making up both
of these beautiful systems again a big
thanks to Coolermaster for throwing and
all of that awesome hardware zing I
can't wait to see it installed with all
of the other components
let's get stacking
all right so here they are all complete
both builds went pretty smoothly
actually and I had overheard some people
say that cable management and the half
stackers would be difficult but they
must have just been lazy or something
because I really had no problems tucking
cables away up in the rafters with the
help of the various tie-down points
right there I should also mention that
despite these cases having gratuitous
amounts of open ventilation both systems
managed to stay respectfully quiet when
idling which I very much appreciate
don't you have a listen don't listen now
so since building I've already installed
windows 8.1 pro on Erin's PC and given
the 2600 K a nice little overclock to
4.6 gigahertz last thing I need to do is
install windows on the stream machine
and get that ready to stream awesome
hardware which by the way is every
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time so if
you actually wanted to see how this new
stream system performs just tune in to
watch me and Paul and see if the system
crashes oh my god but I think that is
gonna do it for now guys so let me know
what you think of my two new stack
Alysha systems and I'm also curious to
know what scenarios you can think of
where the half stackers might be a good
choice also before you leave you can
check out my store and perhaps buy a
shirt like this one while you're there
or bookmark my amazon link and use it
when you buy stuff because you love me
oh yeah don't forget to like the video
I'm Kyle without some sauce Network
thank you guys for watching subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and I
will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
