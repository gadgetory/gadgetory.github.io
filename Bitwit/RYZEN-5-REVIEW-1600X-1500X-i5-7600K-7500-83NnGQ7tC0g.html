all doing well if you happen to be
watching this video on the day of upload
AMD's risin 5 stack of desktop
processors based on the news and
architecture is now here for the taking
hitting store shelves and select
retailers around the globe the 4 chips
in the our 5 line up trail behind the
existing Rison 7 family in both
performance and price making them a
direct competitor to Intel's Core i5
caddy leg processors giving mainstream
gamers and content creators a wider
range of options for the first time in
years
today we'll be focusing on two of the
our 5 SKUs that were sent over by AMD
the 1600 X and 1500 X which are priced
to directly compete with Intel's Core i5
7600 K and 7500 respectively assuming I
can get my hands on them let me know in
the comments if you'd like to see
content pieces on the remaining r5 skews
the 1600 and 1400 like Rison 7 r5 fits
the a m4 socket and supports SMT for
improved performance in multi-threaded
applications over Intel's Core i5 SKUs
which do not support hyper threading the
1600 export 6 cores and 12 threads which
look intimidating next to the 7600 K a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz with exif
our single core boost to 4.0 gigahertz
and a 95 watt TDP the 1500 X is 4 cores
and 8 threads offer a slight bump over
the 7500 while shipping with a 3.5
gigahertz base frequency and single core
turbo 23.7 with the TDP of only 65 watts
the 1500 X gets bundled with AMD's rates
aspire which is a great value add that
can save users a chunk of change on an
aftermarket cooler you can check out my
full review of the Wraith spire for more
info while the pricing from both camps
is competitive it's worth noting that
Rison v also benefits from its
overclocking support on Cheaper be 350
and X 300 boards allowing users to
harness more power out of their chips
for less money compared to Intel
speaking of overclocking all four CPUs
were manually tweaked for today's tests
as you can see here the 1600 X was able
to hit four point one gigahertz whereas
the 1500 X pulled off a 4.0 gigahertz OC
without having to increase voltages it
appears having fewer cores than the
eight core r7 1700 has helped Verizon 5
hit higher frequencies as we saw the
1700 struggle to stir
3.9 gigahertz unless of course you
struck the silicon lottery a 16 gig of
g.skill tried @z ddr4 3200 was paired
with all SKUs as this was the fastest
ddr4 kid I had on hand though I could
not get the memory stable above 3000
megahertz when using the 1500 X so we
may have to wait for a BIOS update
before we can retest the chip and memory
at its rated speed fortunately with a
bit of tweaking the 1600 X had no
problems taking the 3200 megahertz
frequency with the kids default settings
of 14 14 14 14 34 diving into thermals
all SKUs were fitted with air coolers
operating at 100% fan speed not too as
Nhu 12s accompanied our risin 5 CPUs
while the cooler master hyper 212 turbo
assisted our cabling contenders having
identical cooler so we could make direct
thermal comparisons would have been
ideal but I don't currently have an
appropriate cooler for this test with
1151 and a m4 brackets so I'm sorry this
is the best I could do for now Intel
temperatures were tracked with hardware
monitor and AMD temps were recorded
using the latest version of Verizon
master it's important to note here that
this updated version of the software now
displays accurate temperatures for all
existing rising SKUs as opposed to
earlier versions reporting that 20
degrees Celsius offset 495 watt parts in
particular which was quite misleading
when running GTA 5 with the
aforementioned overclocks and an ambient
of 25 degrees Celsius the 1600 X hovered
in the high 50s and low 60s
staying significantly cooler than the
7600 K which at one point hit 80 degrees
Celsius our 1500 X rarely saw
temperatures go above 60 C staying
mostly in the 50s and the 7500 performs
similarly if not coming into the low 60s
a tad more often overall I found the
rising v thermals to be very reasonable
and without 1600 X running around 20
degrees cooler than the 7600 K users
won't have to invest quite as much money
into a third-party aftermarket cooler to
keep their chip under control now here's
a full look at the testing hardware in
an effort to not bottleneck our CPUs
much I decided to test both platforms
with the gtx 1070 boundaries Edition
running stock version 3 78.92 was the
latest wickel driver when I began my
rise in 5 testing but it's worth noting
that version 3 81.6 5 has since become
available I should also mention that at
the time
filming we are using the latest Windows
updates and BIOS version zero five one
five all games were tested in 1920 by
1080 since it's more likely to create a
CPU limited environment though I've also
added 2560 by 1440 as it's an
increasingly popular resolution for
gamers purchasing CPUs within this price
range so moving forward with our first
set of data in Cinebench r15 which
measures single and multi-threaded CPU
performance the 1600 x dominates the
multi-threaded test unsurprisingly with
thirteen hundred and eighty-two marks
the 1500 X being runner-up with 903 in
the single-threaded run however the 7600
K carries a 28% lead over the 1600 X
with a score of 214 this also comes as
no surprise as Rison 7 has already shown
us kb lake single core advantage over
Xen there may be an exception to this
rule at the lower end though as here the
7500 and 1500 X yield identical single
core performance in 3d mark firestrike
extreme we see rising 5 beating out both
of the respective Intel competitors in
the overall score with a smaller lead
for Intel in the graphics department
perhaps indicating the gtx 1070 is being
slightly more bottlenecked by our rising
chips in ashes of the singularity at
1080p the 7600 K takes a 9% lead in
average frame rates over the 1600 X with
comparable 1% in point one percent lows
similarly the 7500 achieved an eight
percent higher average FPS than the 1500
X however our four core rise in five
chip delivers favorable lows at 1440p we
see the game become more GPU bound
closing the performance gap a bit 7600 K
yields a 6.5 percent higher average
frame rate than the 1600 X whereas the
1500 X and 7500 keep neck and neck until
factoring in the 7500 spore frame time
performance indicating a much happier
experience than its competitor in
battlefield 1 at 1080p the 7600 K scores
an average FPS 5 percent higher than the
1600 X again with similar lows while the
7500 takes a 2.5% lead on average but
trails behind the 1500 X in 1% lows also
notice how the cheaper 7500 beats out
the 1600 X in average FPS albeit with
slower frame times cranked it up 2 quad
HD and we see 2 to 3% leads from Intel
and average frame rates
slightly higher frame time performance
from AMD Rison five takes a sizeable
backseat in doom at 1080p with the 7600
K scoring 11 percent higher averages
than the six core rising ship and the
7500 averaging 16 percent better than
the 1500 X this time the 7,500 edges out
the 1600 X by a wide margin rise in
frame x also took a dive with up to a
31% deficit compared to KB Lake
naturally the higher resolution levels
the playing field at 1440p risin comes
within 3 percent of the core i5s
average FPS with lows performing between
4 and 11 percent slower once again we
see intel leading this time in GTA 5 at
1080p with average frame rates the 1600
X falls behind the 7600 K by 13 percent
while the 1500 X trails the 7500 by 18
percent at 1440p intel leads by a slight
margin across the board with all SKUs
averaging over 60 fps in hitman at 1080p
the 7600 K delivers 8% more frames on
average then its competitor while the
7500 sees an increase of roughly 5% our
unlocked core i5 takes a victory point
for slightly higher 1% in point one
percent lows as well the 1600 X and 7500
practically mirror performance at 1440p
and the 7600 K takes the lead in average
fps and frame times as we might expect
by now in Metro last light at 1080p the
7600 K offers 5% more performance than
the 1600 X when it comes to average
frame rates but tanks with its 0.1% lows
as does the 7500 and this is also the
only measurable difference between the
7500 and 1500 X the trend of poor KD
like 0.1% lows continues at 1440p with
similar 1% performance across the board
and marginal gains over Aizen in average
FPS our last game is watchdogs 2 and at
1080p we see a fairly tight performance
gap between SKUs likely due to our gtx
1070 being limited in this GPU intensive
title still the intel gang pulls ahead
by around 4 to 6 percent on average but
shares similar lows with Rison finally
in 1440p we see identical performance
across all chips as the game becomes
even more GPU bound now averaging all
the data from our 7 gaming benchmarks we
can see here that at 1080p the 7600 ko
for 6% higher average FPS than the 1600
X with slightly faster 1% 10.1% lows
well it's by a small margin
this makes the unlocked i-5 the faster
gaming chip while offering more value as
it is $10 cheaper than the 1600 X for
users only interested in gaming the data
points to the 7600 K being the higher
performing option but gamers who perform
tasks such as live-streaming or video
editing should strongly consider the
1600 X for its extra cores and threads
that put the i-5 to shame in
multi-threaded workloads if you purchase
the 1600 X the gains in heavily threaded
tasks will be great and the sacrifice in
gaming performance will be slight you
know unless you're playing do more GTA 5
then get rekt another consideration here
is the 7500 since it matches the
performance of the 1600 X on average but
costs 20% less if you only care about
gaming and are using a gtx 1070 or
slower at 1080p the 7500 can be a great
value over the 1600 X and the 7600 K
based on these results when compared to
the 1500 X the 7500 rendered 8% more
frames on average but comes in at a $10
premium still the 7500 is the wiser
choice for a gaming audience unless
those users also happen to be content
creators in some form who can benefit
from the extra threads on the 1500 X but
will have to do more multi-threaded
testing on that in the future I will say
it is nice to see that the 1600 X is
outperforming the 1500 X by a good seven
to eight percent it would have been a
real disappointment had we encountered
another situation like we did with the
r7 1700 essentially making the 1,800 X
obsolete through overclocking although
to be fair in this case we are dealing
with a different core and thread count
between the chips again averaging all
the data KB Lake still takes the lead at
1440p but only by 5% for the 7600 K and
3% for the 7500 over their respective
competitors in average frame rates 1%
and point one percent lows are nearly
identical between all SKUs for users
gaming at 1440p this narrow performance
gap makes a stronger case for Rison 5
especially since greater core and thread
optimizations seem to be where the
industry is headed in closing KB Lake is
still the
crown holder when it comes to peer
gaming performance but risin 5 isn't far
behind and will hopefully only improve
as more developers optimize their games
from the Zen architecture
not to mention risin is still the more
versatile and affordable option for
those branching outside the realm of
gaming but that's all I've got for now
guys feel free to share your thoughts on
rising 5 so far in the comments I'm very
curious to hear them blow it up down
below and don't forget to toss me a look
on this video if you enjoyed it it helps
me very much as always thank you guys so
much for watching subscribe to the
