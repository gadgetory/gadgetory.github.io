channel hope you're all doing well
hopefully you had a fun and safe New
Year's with your friends and family or
whoever else you decide to spend it with
and hope hopefully you're all alive and
well here in 2016 but today is the day
before I leave for CES it's Monday as
I'm filming this at Sunday but when
you're watching this if you're watching
it on day of upload it's probably Monday
I leave for Vegas tomorrow on Tuesday
and I'm gonna be bringing a lot of stuff
with me this year probably more than I
ever had before I am bringing on an
editor a good buddy of mine his name's
Joe he will be editing all of the
footage for CES 2016 this year so I have
a lot more stuff because he's coming
with me and I need to support enough
hardware for myself and him as well
so that's pretty much what this video is
all about it's about what I'm bringing
with me to see us all the tech stuff
anyway I'm not gonna tell you what you
know what color underwear I'm bringing
but you know maybe maybe in the future
so on that note I'm just gonna dive
right into it because there's a lot of
stuff here guys I wish I could break it
down for you and in a table of contents
or something so you could just see which
parts you're interested in but it's
really just chaos so I can't really
organize that well so starting off with
this part of the table I'm just gonna go
from left to right order none of it is
particularly more important than the
other it's all equally important when
trying to cover a behemoth of a
convention like CES so starting with the
computer so this is our stream box this
is what Paul and I use to stream
episodes of awesome Hardware each week
and we will be streaming again on
Tuesday in Las Vegas at my place I'm not
gonna be staying at a hotel this year I
actually booked an Airbnb for those of
you who don't know what that is you can
Wikipedia tour look it up but basically
I'm gonna be staying in a two or
three-bedroom condo and we are gonna be
streaming Paul and I are gonna be
streaming awesome hardware from that
place so obviously we need a good
streaming box we're gonna use the trusty
streamer pc that we've been using at my
place every other week and it's gonna
work out fantastically it's got the
Blackmagic capture card in there we are
gonna have this monitor hooked up to it
it's a Ben Q what's the model number
it's the XL to 730 Z from Ben Q and it
is a 2560 by 14
forty panel it is a TN monitor so it's
super fast but the color reproduction
isn't all that great sorry if my camera
is out of focus right now it always does
that but luckily we won't really be
using it for color correction like I
said it's just gonna be for streaming so
we're gonna have like web browsers up
and stuff and exploit things like that
but this is gonna be a secondary monitor
as well for my editor the other monitor
I'm bringing which is gonna be his
primary one is that Kunik Stu 710 right
over there beautiful panel that is IPS
also 2560 by 1440 so he'll have those
two monitors side by side at his
disposal when editing which I'm pretty
sure he'll be happy about apart from
that we've got some peripherals here so
starting with the mice we've got my
wireless g6o - this is pretty much my
laptop mouse of choice I did a brief
kind of mini review on this in one of my
peripheral roundup videos recently
excellent mice excellent mouse I should
say that I'm gonna be using the rocket
tie on also a great go to a little
pointer it's it's it's really handy it's
super comfortable my editor might be
using this I'm also gonna be bringing my
g500 over there I haven't put all the
things I'm taking with me onto these
tables here because I'm still using some
of them so I'm gonna be bringing that
guy along as well I'm probably gonna let
Joe decide which one he thinks is more
comfortable we've also got a couple
keyboards here so we've got the 10
keyless Nova touch from coolermaster
with the Nova Nova touch switches
they're they're really really kind of an
acquired taste but I've grown accustomed
to them at this point also the Vermeil
oh the Vermeil oh god what's the model
number of this thing leave our mil ova
87m mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX
brown switches this thing's just super
cool pretty much the same form factor as
the the Nova touch here so as you can
see we're really kind of going with
portability in mind
excellent keyboard both keyboards are
great all-around choices I think for
events like this obviously you don't get
that number pad but I am trying to keep
things on the slimmer side so hopefully
that'll do us
do us proud we've also got some mouse
pads here apart from these USB cables
for the keyboards we've got the tech
syndicate one excellent keyboard I like
it because it's super thin it's got
stitched edges a nice rubber bottom and
it's got that badass raise the world
logo on the front there we've also got
my classic Crysis 3 mouse pads that have
been here for quite some time I've been
using these throughout the years
they are really small and portable as
well and then we've got a mixing board I
can't tell you the exact model number
but this is also for the stream on
Tuesday this is from mana price it's a
great little board it's a budget board
it's probably like sixty to ninety bucks
something like that mana price was kind
enough to sponsor this for us for me and
Paul so I can't tell you the exact
specifics but excellent little mixing
board we've also got some sound
monitoring materials here so we've got
my dt 880 pros my trusty cans they're
open back semi open back design super
comfortable or ear pads bucho I'm
probably know that my editor use and
then I might be hopping onto these k7x
X's just did a recent review of these
probably about a month ago from AKG
these are the master op editions super
clean sounding great for music but also
great for editing they're very very
clean sounding headphones all around
next up we've got the main editing
system for Joe so this is the sleeper PC
many of you guys might have recognized
it right off the bat it's compacted into
this small but crappy an unsuspecting HP
Pavillion case that is literally like
ten years old now eleven years old now
that it's 2016 but that's why it's a
sleeper PC because it's designed to look
like crap so nobody wants to steal it or
ever thinks about touching it but the
internals are just absolutely beastly so
we've got a core i7 6600 K which is
overclocked as well as as otech amp
Edition gtx 980ti for all of our editing
purposes 16 gigs of ram you can go ahead
and check out my video on that if you
want more specifics but I'm really
excited to be using this this is the
first time I'll be using it out in the
field so I'm kind of curious to see how
it performs but it's already loaded up
with the full Adobe Creative Suite for
editing Premiere Pro Photoshop After
Effects things like that we've also got
a really long this is probably a 50 foot
Ethernet cable that we'll be using in
the Nutter Hotel but our Airbnb pad it's
always nice to have a direct connection
there especially when you're uploading
videos on the fly we've also got a few
flash devices here well we've got my SSD
this is an SP 900 from a data 512
gigabyte actually and this has got all
my assets on it important files and
documents that I need for for editing on
the go but it sits in this really nice
Kingston enclosure it's kind of
sacrilegious to put an a data SSD and a
HyperX
enclosure but there you have it it is
USB 3 is
well so get some nice transfer speeds
there also this little data traveler
from Kingston USB 3 flash drive it's 32
gigs got this a while back at another
convention can't tell you if it was CES
or Computex but one of those
complimentary gifts that had the the
press kit on it so this is really come
in handy for a lot of events I've also
got my trusty Nexus 7 my Asus tablet
this thing rocks I love taking it
everywhere I go whether I'm on a plane
or just gonna be driving somewhere far
away it's nice to have this if I'm just
you know chillin at the at the pad I
want to check some Twitter's reply to
you guys on Instagram or whatever it's
also a really great asset to bring along
we've also got a few more wired things
just a basic extension cord we've got a
power strip here which is really handy
we're gonna have a lot of stuff being
plugged in so really it's I would highly
suggest bringing a power strip pretty
much any time you go to an event where
you're bringing a lot of gear we've also
got this Manfrotto monopod now we're
gonna kind of get into the film
equipment now and I just did a recent
gear 2.0 updates on the channel so you
can check that out for for more details
but this is a really great monopod yep
black shaft then we've got my new Lumix
gh4 from panasonic excellent camera with
a sigma 18 to 35 millimeter lens with a
small rig handle right here attached to
a 515 cage from defocused systems
excellent little piece of piece of
equipment they're also my sennheiser in
cage 416 microphone the shotgun
microphone is absolutely fantastic it's
got a little foam on here so you can't
really see it all too well and I've got
my three trusty lenses beyond the Sigma
for various shooting purposes so I got
my two Rokinon lenses 35 and 24
millimetres respectively and then a 60
millimeter macro lens from Canon this is
probably not going to get used too much
I won't be taking too many super
close-up macro shots but it is there in
case I do need it moving on to the
batteries for the gh4 we've got two of
them here and there's already one inside
of the camera so we've got a total of
three batteries to take with us on the
go the battery life on the gh4 is pretty
awesome
from what I can tell from reviews and
personal use it's done it's done it's
doing really well of leaps and bounds
better than the 70d that I used to have
and I've got an AC adapter right there
as well because we are going to be using
this Paul and I are going to be using
the gh4 for the live show so it's nice
to have that adapter
continuous power SD cards very important
we've got to 256 gig PNY elite
performance cards right there they are
rated for 4k and ninety-five megabytes
per second should be more than enough
but just in case I've also got to 64
gigs another 32 and then second 32 gig
which is actually in the the
point-and-shoot camera that I have right
now my RX 103 from Sony which I will be
bringing but obviously I can't really
show you that we've got a simple camera
brush right here for your lens in case
it gets dusty during the event which is
always nice to have a little Bose
speaker this kind of came with my phone
as like a freebie
they just threw it in it's actually a
pretty decent sounding speaker Bose I
know it's you know that gets a lot of
hate gets a bad rap for being overpriced
and stuff which it is but this guy is
super portable and it sounds decent
enough to fill a room so this will be
nice listening to music while we're at
the pad very cool we've also got two msi
battery backups battery banks ten
thousand four hundred milliamps apiece
they're just simple you know USB type a
and mini USB or micro USB I should say
do they need to be charged yes they do
these are these are very low a lot to
charge things before we go but these are
excellent to have on the show floor
always bring backup batteries guys if
you're gonna be using your phone a lot
at conventions which most of the time
you are tweeting out things and and
posting on social media also moving back
to two over here so you might realize
that I have my microphone but I don't
have my dr-40 taz cam recorder which
it's usually hooked up to that's because
I'm recording with it right now I've got
a lavalier mic attached to it as well I
will be bringing both of those and this
this really handy thing I think I stole
it from Steve Steve oMG but basically
attaches to your belt and then you can
screw on the the recorder to - to this
thing and it's a quick release latch so
you kind of just press it in and then
the whole recorder comes out for ease of
handling or you can just slap it back on
your belt so you can take it around
really nice to have also we've got a
handheld condenser mic I couldn't tell
you what model this is but I use this
for last year CES and I thought the
audio quality sounded actually really
good considering you know the 50 to 100
bucks I paid for it so I will be busting
that that out again you might be
wondering why do I have a handheld mic
and the Sennheiser shotgun this is just
for ease of use if let's say I'm at a
hotel suite I'm not necessarily on the
show floor the Suites and the little
Suites of the hotels they're a lot
quieter generally there's not as much
chatter and ambient noise so usually you
can get away with something like this
just directly mounted to your to your
camera there but if you're on the show
floor and it's super noisy as hell you
might want to have a handheld mic to
give yourself a bit more control and
better positioning for that microphone
so I brought both it's always good to
have both options in case you need it
moving on to the end of the line here
pretty close we've got my msi gs70
review of this msi has really done
themselves out with with this model it's
just absolutely beautiful runs like a
champ I think it's got a core i7 it's
it's definitely skylake and it's got a
970 gtx 970m in there as well with three
gigs of the ram but also we've got let's
see we've got some more batteries here
these are just double a's that they're
gonna be powering my dr-40 with
recharges you got there they are
rechargeable so I've got Amazon brand
which are a little bit cheaper and the
eneloop which are a bit more expensive
but I think they do last a bit longer
than the Amazon once I just kind of have
both here I've accumulated them over
time this is simply a bag for my rx100
m3 which again I'm shooting with right
now extra batteries and charger inside
for here and then we've got my delicious
tripod I'll put all the links all this
stuff in the description can tell you
the model number off the top of my head
but it is the O 5 v series from
Manfrotto excellent excellent tripod I
actually just got this recently this
could have easily gone in my gear gear
2.0 update but somehow I overlooked it
excellent piece of equipment there plus
my also Manfrotto 502 fluid head this
thing I've been using since I don't know
2013 and I don't see myself changing
anytime soon because it's just a super
smooth head that that works beautifully
and then we've got this boompole
microphone for the live show to mic both
me and Paul so that we sound excellent
in the best way possible you can hear
our sexy voices by just getting optimal
positioning with that boom mic it's a
very nice budget boom mic there and then
finally wrapping up we've got my bags to
carry all of this after all this is a
what's in my bag video right so you got
to have some bags so I've got my canon
bag this is a great bag it's it
basically holds all my lenses and the
body it's kind of funny though that now
I've switched over to pants
I'm still rocking a cannon bag that's
that's also kind of blasphemy but this
is an excellent bag super high quality
and it fits everything I need without
being overwhelmingly large which a lot
of a lot of other bags tend to do that's
kind of one of the compromises and then
I've got this amazonbasics bag super
cheap it's like 30 bucks the quality
isn't nearly what you'd find with the
cannon bag it is much cheaper I will say
everything on it works works good enough
except for the zippers the zippers can
get snagged rather easily but apart from
that the pocketing is really good really
good pocket options and sizes all around
it's got a keyring a place for a 15.6
inch laptop just like the ghost pro
right over there so it fits everything
in a nice package and it was 30 bucks so
I'm really not gonna complain much but
there you guys have it that is pretty
much all the stuff here's one more
overarching look one more glance at all
the things I'm bringing with me to CES
so yeah it's um it's gonna be fun it's
kind of exciting getting all this stuff
prepared because it's just it's just an
indication of the kind of scale of the
content I'll be creating for you guys
and just how much fun it's gonna be
making all these videos I will be
pumping out significantly more videos
this year than I did last year last year
I only did one video a day and I don't
know I think I just wasn't as prepared
for CES then as I am this year and this
year I'm probably be pumping out
anywhere from 10 to 15 videos over the
course of the entire week so I know
that's not as much as some other YouTube
channels are doing but at the same time
it's a lot more than what I was doing
last year so I just wanted to give you
guys a head up heads up and let you know
that I will be pumping out some some
pretty heavy-duty content but hopefully
it's good I'm still gonna try to take a
very mild and unprofessional approach to
it because that's just how I roll I just
don't have a professional bone in my
body it's probably why I work
independently in my room but nonetheless
I've rambled on long enough as always
thank you guys so much for watching this
video let me know what you think of all
this gear in the comments below what
your expectations are for CES and I will
be seeing you guys in the next video
which is going to be at
say yes in Las Vegas so thanks guys love
you all Happy New Year once again and
I'll see you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
