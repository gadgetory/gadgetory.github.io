why you're watching me play crysis 3
instead of my lovely face it's because
i've been shifting some stuff in my room
around and quite frankly it's not a
pretty sight to look at so you can watch
me get blown up right here and swim
through the water and get lost and
drowns but this is basically a follow up
video in a way to the previous one that
i did when i did that whole new
methodology of a benchmarking i kind of
took a different route and surprisingly
i got a lot of positive feedback from
you guys so long to behold i'm doing it
again this time with some mid-range GPUs
specifically some nvidia geforce gtx
series cards i will get around to doing
some AMD cards in the near future so
don't freak out and d card users that is
coming soon um but yeah let me see one
of the things I want to talk about in
this video um good feedback oh yes I am
doing a different benchmark mood for
this this test i'm not using the first
level again because as we all know now I
found out a little bit too late actually
the rope physics were all screwed up for
that first level it made the frame rate
drop ridiculously so i actually will
should be showing you guys my new
benchmark loop right now alright so with
this new benchmark loop that i'm doing i
actually took some inspiration from
Linus and slicks video thank you guys
for letting me rip off your bench
marking methodology so this is actually
the same general area that they are in
when they begin their loop it's except
it's a little bit before that so this is
going to vary slightly but thank you
again why doesn't slick please don't sue
me so before I even start my testing I
actually want to pull out my crossbow
and enable or equip my explosive tip
right there my explosive arrow tip
because I'm going to be using that
shortly and then as soon as I begin my
benchmark i press the armor and I go
down that hatch right there and I look
up and I wait for psycho cuz he's slow
and as soon as he gets to the bottom of
this stairway right here I begin to
follow him just like that and this is
pretty much where line is in the slick
start pretty similar to more
and I basically follow him through this
little tunnel area here and I try to
keep a medium distance away from him at
all times so I can see most of his body
especially his feet going through the
water like that so I can see the ripples
and there are a few moments in this kit
and in this set a little run here though
where he'll actually stop and wait for
you just like that and he'll just sit
there until you catch up to him so be
aware of that you want to be standing
waiting for him waiting for you for too
long buddy just finish out this little
run here and like slick said by the way
there's a lot of good opportunity for
collision and water effects as you saw
cycling myself right through the cloth
there as well as the lovely blades of
grass all around so as soon as he drops
that he's going to motion downward with
his hand and when he does that I'm going
to run to the door so right there you
run through and as soon as I open the
store here I enable my cloak and I pull
back my lovely arrow and I blow up that
turret right there it's gonna make my
life a hell of a lot easier for this
benchmark
and kill this dude yes take his gun why
not that doesn't really matter I had I'm
gonna run up here there's another guy
sleeping around here safe came out
another be right here oh just kill
everyone don't really no need to take
your time here just kind of plow through
it and the very end you make this final
jump and I stop my benchmark right about
there alright so for my testing hardware
i am still borrowing the core i7 3960 x
thankfully and the asus rampage for
formula as well along with 16 gigs of
g.skill trident x ram the video cards
i'm using lovely cards here we have
today once again this is a geforce gtx
kind of special video so like i said
don't worry if you have an AMD card i
will be getting to those soon so for now
i have an EVGA gtx 670 for the win and
msi gtx 660ti power edition a galaxy gtx
660 overclocked and an msi gtx 650ti
power edition as well and you'll notice
all of these cards are factory
overclocked and i figured this was kind
of a representative of you know the real
real world scenario in most of your
cases because i'm assuming you either
have a factory overclocked card already
or your manually overclocking your card
yourselves or both right so let's go on
to my first benchmark test with at 1920
x 1080 you can see here the EVGA gtx 670
for the win was able to perform at above
30 frames per second at minimum with the
system specs at high and the texture res
at very high very impressive SMAA and
anisotropic filtering at 4x + 16 x x
respectively and the game still looked
really really nice on even though i was
playing on a 27 inch monitor it still
looked awesome and for the record guys
blurred was set to medium and flair was
on yes for all of these tests at both
resolutions moving out of the gtx 660ti
from msi this is a power edition card
system specs still able to operate it
high and texture res had to bump that
down too
i coming from the 670 and SMA as you can
see there had to be bumped down to 2x
and anisotropic filtering was a you know
still still keep it up at 4x which i
thought was pretty nice so you're not
really seeing terribly much of a
performance hit going from the 670 to
the 660 ti but you are seeing quite a
performance hit going from the TI to the
regular 660 version of the card um but
oh really quickly what do you want to
mention look at the average frame rate
for the 660 ti the MSI it's at 66 and
the max FPS is higher than all the other
cards to at 94.6 i retested this card
over and over and over to make sure that
it wasn't a fluke and that I wasn't
doing something incorrectly but that's
what I got and it's it's you know keep
in mind you of this isn't your average
apples to apples benchmark test but
relatively speaking I mean the the
minimum with the minimum frame rate
being just above 30 for all the cards I
was still getting quite a few more
frames per second on average and at max
with the 660 ti so good job 660 ti and
you to msi for the galaxy gtx 660 like i
said we're taking much more of a
performance hit here so i just wanted to
say yeah there's quite a huge
performance gap for the money that
you're paying you actually get a lot
more performance jumping from a 662 a TI
you can see the system specs for the 660
had to be bumped down to medium as well
as the texture resolution an SMA a at 2x
with the anisotropic filtering at 2x as
well with a 660 ti you're starting to
near console territory dare i say as far
as video quality goes not quite there
yet but getting close with anisotropic
filtering completely disabled and 1x and
it struck I'm sorry anti-aliasing
completely disabled and 1x anisotropic
filtering it's just starting to look a
little iffy but if you think that's bad
wait till you go to 2560 by 1600 the
resolution that many video cards fear so
the 660 I'm sorry the 670 for the win
actually still is keeping in the game I
guess you know you're starting to see
some some serious quality droppage here
especially if you're like zooming in on
blades of grass you can kind of start to
see that jaggedy staircase effect that's
basically because anti-aliasing is
disabled now
and we're operating off of 1x
anisotropic filtering with a 660 ti you
can see that you're still getting if you
look at the frame rates yet still
perform outperforming the other two
cards as far as average frame rate and
max frame rate definitely max frame rate
at 74.6 but we are having to step down
from our high throne with system specs a
medium now and texture resolution and
medium as well anti-aliasing still
disabled and 1x anisotropic filtering
the gtx 660 now now we're in console
territory looking at the back of psycho
during that tunnel run it just looks
terrible I mean there's like no
tessellation whatsoever his body looks
like a piece of cardboard it's just
horrible I mean look at that 650ti and
it's kind of hilarious ID why did I even
test this card at this resolution on
this game yeah for fun average framerate
31.4 so 21.5 as you can see there at
minimum frames per second on average I
mean the game looks like crap at this
point and you can't even play the game I
mean it looks like a flip book is being
flipped by a sloth but given the fact
that this is a lower end card and we are
pushing it against a very graphically
intensive game at a very high resolution
these results are completely expected
and with that I believe that is all the
information I want to share with you
