computer case yeah it's the define us
root fractal design they run so quietly
I figured I'd put it there as a reminder
that in this crazy hectic world
silence really is golden is that this
same computer case yeah
the finance supports triple radiators
water cooling pumps and reservoirs so I
figured I'd put one there just to remind
myself to be flexible in life really in
the bathroom why well yeah I figured the
toilet hasn't been working lately and
the define us has such a spacious
interior that I just thought my god the
defined s from fractal design is built
for uncompromised custom water cooling
please use responsibly click the link in
the description for more info wasn't you
guys welcome back to the channel today
I've got something a little bit
different planned in store for you all
today instead of doing a typical
unboxing I am going to do in untypical
unboxing no it's it's not difficult what
I have here today is a comic-con box
it's kind of like a loot crate it's
basically something that you pay a
monthly subscription for and then they
send you this come whatever company
sends you a box of stuff it's usually
filled with like little collectibles
nerd and geek things so this is actually
from Wizard world which is the company
who throws comic-con box
who goes comic-con the event the
worldwide event all over the entire
world actually this is my lovely and
beautiful fiance Heather and I've
invited her on today for today's video
to help me unbox this thing because
there's probably some goodies in here
actually she's already seen what's in
the content the contents of this box
whereas whereas I have not so you're
gonna see my first reaction by the way
if you're wondering where I got this or
why I got this I
partnered with fullscreen they're one of
the biggest YouTube networks out there
and some one of the reps there just
contacted me contacted me was like hey
if you want to comic-con box and I was
like I had actually never even heard of
it so I was like yeah sure I'll take a
pretty stuff like pretty things so let's
let's just get right down to it then
shall we I'm gonna open this guy up
violent drumroll geez good thing my
grandparents aren't asleep then alright
so I think there's a free t-shirt that
comes with all the stuff is free
technically well not free it's pay for
it
a a gift t-shirt in every box and this
is no strings no strings what is this
that was my first guest thank you maybe
the folks at Wizard World custom-made a
shirt just for me and they put my face
on okay this is freaking me out a little
let's put this away for now but that's
cool I'm kind of impressive they put a
t-shirt a guaranteed t-shirt in every
box next up we've got a mug that's one
second mug strategic homeland
intervention enforcement its agents of
shield yeah I've seen the first episode
of the show and it didn't hook me right
away but I might give it a second chance
especially now that I have a shield
branded mug how can I not I feel
obligated to it's a nice mug it's it's
actually larger than than a regular mug
if any of you know how large your
regular mug is she'll probably be using
that most of the time cuz she drinks
coffee and I don't I treated sometimes
when you sleep you cap
but very cool very cool all right moving
on here what do we got here mustache
friends
it's a plush mustache I should probably
put it on cuz you already have a
mustache
well some would argue against that
actually I don't know what I'm doing
here you have nails so you get that open
while I keep prying around here next up
we've got this little Avengers mash'ems
that's a little collectible it says
twist them and squish them
I like squishing things
oh it's Thor I got a little four oh it's
weird it's he's squishy feeling he's
really squishy what nail fail ah see you
sort of trying hard enough
all right so what what character should
I am I really worried is it a unibrow no
you actually pull it off quite nicely no
room for ventilation all right what do
we got next
this is a Lego luggage tag that's pretty
cool I like that one's my favorite thing
by the time ago in a timeline for a
honeymoon
I call dibs okay you can use whatever
crappy paper one this metal earth 3d
metal model kits from Mass Effect 360
product view instructions included good
because it looks difficult
I can build a computer but I don't know
if I can build this little steel toy
without instructions so next up we've
got cont V no that says con TV actually
as mmm totally read that wrong this is a
free two week trial Power Rangers on
there so it's kind of like a Netflix for
geeks maybe I'm scared of free trials
because you're like oh it's free there's
no harm in trying it and then you get
hooked that's the whole point of the
free trial and then you're like well now
I can't live without and a half to pay
the ten ninety-nine a month or whatever
it is still a nice gesture I suppose
bonus item winner what this is just a
what is this those your same reaction
what did I win it what did I win it's
just a sticker this has got to be some
inside thing that I'm not getting or
what is this cards part of the box this
is cardboard look they gave us free
cardboard oh there's more cardboard
Avengers trading cards collectables
collect all new untold tales from the
crease Cold War all right what do we got
here wait these aren't like real cards
they've got like yeah it's a comic in
the form of trading cards and I don't
like that because it actually
another thing I have to do before I can
read the comic so bad idea but much
appreciated this is next month box three
adventure order now I think this is just
an advertisement to buy more this is an
app don't put these in boxes no next
we've got ooh look at this this is an
actual comic book this is a secret Wars
there's one on the back no wait that's a
little poster that's really cool Batman
and Iron Man looking pretty thug life
right there back to the comic book
secret war is it looks like the Hulk in
Wolverine that's exciting it's really
nice artwork I must say I feel like this
is the last thing I got I caught a
glimpse of it I didn't exactly see what
it was but it's laminated it's
completely laminated and it looks like a
photo of some sort let's go look at it
now oh yes it's her do you know her yes
she's from doesn't she in does it say on
the back who is this oh it's Chloe
Smallville I used to watch that show
when I was in high school I know and it
was like the only TV show I watched and
I always thought she was she's pretty
hot I'm gonna hang this okay this is
really cool actually and it is
autographed by her it's not like a stamp
it's not a sticker or a print it's
actually her signature I can smell her
okay she's gonna hold on to that but
that pretty much concludes the unboxing
it's empty that was those were all the
things in the comic-con box that I got
pretty exciting stuff even though I
didn't know exactly what everything was
there were a couple things that escaped
me
I find the mug to also be pretty awesome
yeah it will get the most used I think
I'm sure the mug the luggage tag my
three favorite things although the thing
that I probably might use more than the
mug itself is the moustache I think I
think this is kind of coming with me
everywhere I go now again you're putting
it upside down oh my goodness that's
pretty much gonna wrap it up for this
here video if you guys enjoyed it please
