to the whole pub key for tonight and
eSports phenomenon and looked at the
whole landscape of gaming and said we
can make a boatload of money if we just
sell some gaming pcs and that's exactly
what they've done they've recently
announced a new line of gaming laptops
and desktops called overpowered or Opie
that they've done in collaboration with
the eSports Arena company and so far a
lot of tech news outlets are giving this
line high praise saying the core specs
are pretty decent and the pricing is
relatively fair for what you're getting
but what are you getting really the
inner Mac's like fusion 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler features a
one-of-a-kind RGB sink water block with
built-in flow indicator static pressure
optimized RGB fans and a high-efficiency
ceramic bearing pump for exceptional
durability and noiseless operation click
on the link below to learn more anyway
though I'm trying to stay optimistic
with this whole gaming line thing but at
the same time I don't want Walmart to
follow suit with a lot of existing
system integrators who sell very
affordable pre-built at the expense of
cutting corners where they shouldn't
throwing dirt cheap cases into their
systems or really cheap power supplies
that blow out in the first 6 months just
so that they can make their margins and
the last thing I want is a bunch of kids
or adults going out and buying these
systems because they're there and
they're relatively affordable and they
have all these really good core specs
and then finding out too late that they
bought a junk rig so yeah I've seen how
some s eyes make their money I don't
agree with it fully and I'm hoping that
Walmart isn't going down the same path I
can't say for sure just yet and there's
still gonna be a lot of questions that
go unanswered in this video because we
only have so much information to work
with but we're at least gonna be looking
at that information more closely today
so we can infer some things about these
systems now I'm gonna save the gaming
laptops for another video we're only
gonna be taking a look at the gaming
desktop starting with the dtw one at
thirteen hundred and ninety nine dollars
DTW two at 1899 and the dtw 3 at 2099 US
you can see the cases look pretty
identical and they each have a core i7
8700 from Intel this is a non case Q you
won't be able to do any CPU overclocking
on any of these systems as you might
expect we've got different graphics
cards for each of these systems starting
with the gtx 1070 moving up to a gtx
1080 and then finally a gtx 1080 TI
we're also upgrading the memory slightly
going from 16 gigs to 32 gigs and again
32 gigs storage is the only other major
change between these systems as far as I
could tell
with a 256 gig SSD on the dtw one and
then the other two have a 512 gig SSD I
believe all of them however do you have
a mechanical hard drive probably of 2
terabytes let me double check yeah they
all feature a 2 terabyte 7200 rpm
mechanical drive now we're only gonna be
taking a closer look at the dt w1 for
today because we can assume that the
other systems are put together in a very
similar fashion with the same quality
and so forth so again this is the one
featuring the gtx 1070 first let's take
a look at the core specs here the list
is fairly vague again we have that Intel
Core i7 8700 with a geforce gtx 1070
with 8 gigs of VRAM now there's no
manufacturer or adding board partner
listed here we'll take a closer look at
that in the pictures in just a moment
from memory we have 16 gigs of ram at 24
40 megahertz first of all it's funny
that they don't list ddr4 even though
that's relatively implied and this is a
very peculiar Ram speed indicating that
you know this is probably just sort of a
OAM kit that's being sold exclusively to
system integrators that you can't find
on the market because I have never seen
a kit of ddr4 at this rated speed you
guys let me know if you've seen
otherwise storage is 2 terabyte hard
drive 256 gig SSD also no manufacturer
Windows 10 B already and a bunch of
other basic specs so assessing this at
face value right off the bat it looks
and sounds like a pretty powerful system
I mean you've got a core i7 8700 a gtx
1070 your ears kind of perk up when you
hear those specs and you go hey that's
that's a pretty fast rig and i'm sure it
probably is but let's take a look at
some of the finer print and details here
starting with the case let's take a look
at some photos shall we now from the
outside it looks like a pretty proper
case you got tempered glass on the front
inside if that's what you're into
you got RGB fans I would imagine that
this is RGB because why not as 2018
bitches and it looks relatively clean
and simple and straightforward now
something else that's interesting about
this photo is that if you look at the
rear exhaust fan you can see that it's
kind of eclipsed by this rectangular
shape right where the CPU cooler would
be meaning that this is probably an
aftermarket heatsink tower design cooler
and we don't have to deal with an Intel
stock cooler in one of these systems if
this picture is accurate assuming so
that's good that means we're gonna see
potentially lower temperatures and
noise profile at least for the cooling
solution on our CPU if you look at the
back of the case there are a couple
things that stand out to me for starters
we've got this power supply cut out that
looks a little on the cheap side I mean
I'm not gonna judge a case by its PSU
cutout because that's a saying but I
don't know it just it just doesn't look
super high quality to me looks it looks
kind of thin and flimsy because you
could really see the the cutout edges
and sort of see that it wasn't painted
on the inside there and also the thumb
screws on the left side panel or I guess
on the right side panel are relatively
cheap looking obviously the ones on the
tempered glass look fine but these ones
look small and they look a little
plastic key if they're plastic that's a
sign right there and also I just noticed
I skimmed over this initially but maybe
you guys caught it if you look at this
the front IO if you look at the actual
case ports we have three USB 2.0 ports
no mention of any USB 3.0 ports it's 20
18 people and there are no USB 3 ports
on this case that is a red flag that
this is no more than a $60 case if I
were to take my best guess so it looks
really nice but when you take a closer
look that's not entirely the case pun
intended
now what we just learned some things
about this case from looking at its
behind this picture also tells us some
things about the other components in the
system for one we've got this case fan
that's included again it's probably RGB
or even if it's not who cares
looks to be a 120 millimeter fan I don't
see any red flags right off the bat but
to the left of that we can see our
motherboards rear i/o which gives us a
couple warnings that this might be a
budget option for starters we've got two
ps2 ports now you would not even a combo
port just like one for Mouse and one for
keyboard and we have a single d-sub VGA
port not that you're gonna need any
video outs most likely from your
motherboard because we've got two
discrete GPU here but even on budget
boards you typically see a DVI port
there as well maybe an HDMI but no you
just get VGA d-sub which again indicates
that this is a relatively cheap board
and then I think the biggest indicator
here that we're a pretty entry-level is
two USB ports even some of the 60 or $70
B 360 options have more than two USB 3
ports so again I'm not exactly sure what
motherboard this is but I have a pretty
good idea
of how much Walmart might have spent on
it just below we see the rear i/o for
our video card which is evidently
rocking the two slot design and the
reference video outputs for Pascal a3
DisplayPort one HDMI and one dueling DVI
what really gave this card away as to
what it might be however was seemingly
the least important thing on this back
panel which is the ventilation slots
based on this pattern I was actually
able to match it up with a gigabyte card
the rear panel of the gigabyte gtx 1070
windforce OSI model actually matches up
perfectly with the rear panel here and
it's also the cheapest gigabyte gtx 1070
currently on the market leading me to
believe that this is the card that we're
seeing here this is pretty good news if
it's true because gigabyte is a
reputable added board partner for
graphics cards and this card seems to
have a relatively decent dual fan
heatsink cooler on it making this one of
the more compelling components in this
entire system moving along here it looks
like we actually have a PCIe expansion
card for what looks to be USB 3.1 type C
it's hard to say if this is Gen 1 or Gen
2 but I would imagine Walmart install
this card because they knew that type C
is becoming increasingly popular and
they wanted to put that on their spec
list without having to upgrade to a much
fancier and more expensive motherboard
that would feature that port so I
suppose this is a much cheaper solution
that still gets the job done there's
something kind of interesting that I
barely caught I actually noticed in just
moments before I started shooting this
video is if you look past this
ventilation slot at the right you can
kind of see a silhouette of custom
sleeved cables going to the graphics
card
these are definitely PSU cables and
they're definitely custom because stock
PSU cables don't Bend and sort of curve
this naturally or gracefully which is
kind of cool and makes sense too if
you're selling a system with a case that
has tempered glass on the side panel
you'd want it to look relatively nice on
the inside as well sort of appeal to
gamers and all that so it makes sense
spend another 20 30 bucks on your
overhead get some nice slave cables in
there and also below the cable you can
kind of see a power supply shroud you
can kind of see the orange lighting
reflecting off of whatever cheap steel
is in there but it's not too surprising
to see a power supply basement inside of
a cheap case these days because they're
relatively inexpensive to integrate so
that's kind of interesting and then
finally we've got our power supply let's
talk about the PSU for a minute here
like I said a lot of system integrators
are known to cut corners specifically
with their power supplies that
Blowout way sooner than gamers would
like them to so I can't really tell you
much about this unit you know I can't
tell you the wattage the efficiency if
it's 80 80 plus or to fight or not there
are units that look this cheap from
behind that are still 80 plus certified
so I can't just say immediately that
it's not but it remains to be seen what
kind of wattage and efficiency we're
actually gonna be looking at here for me
power supplies are literally the biggest
concern with pre belts because they have
the potential to damage every other part
in your system they connect to
everything and if something were to go
seriously south you could be looking at
a lot more than just a damaged PSU so
hopefully whatever units in there
Walmart has chosen wisely so what do we
know for sure we know that we've got an
8700 in here which retails for three
hundred and twenty dollars right now on
Amazon and Newegg we know that we have a
gtx 1070 most likely something like a
win force OSI which is also about three
hundred and seventy dollars right now on
Newegg and the two parts that I am
pretty certain as far as their value are
the case which I'm gonna guess is around
$60 and the motherboard which I'm also
gonna guess goes for around $60 so if
you add all that up you get three
million no that's wrong you get eight
hundred and ten dollars subtract that
from 1,400 you get five hundred and
ninety yes I had to use a calculator for
that kind of suck at math it means
Walmart potentially has $600 left over
to split between memory cooler power
supply SSD hard drive and cables which
apart from memory to be honest is
actually pretty doable they can get away
with some pretty decent hardware with
that amount the problem is is that they
don't really have $600 left over to
split between those parts because they
have to skim some of it off the top for
profit for themselves when you buy a
free belt some of the money goes to the
person selling the system and we just
don't know how much Walmart is planning
to skim off the top of these desktops in
the first place if they're aiming for a
$300 profit then they're only leaving
you $300 left to split between the six
components that I just rattled off in
that case it's gonna be a pretty bad
build you're gonna get a crap power
supply a crap SSD and so forth but until
more details come to light we just don't
know but that's all I got for now guys
let me know what you think about this in
the comments below tousle work on this
video if you enjoyed it and get
subscribed
for more tech stuff coming at you really
soon guys thanks for tuning in to this
one have a good one and I'll see y'all
