both now we should get which angels
about be like all right if you can't see
us right now or hear us then say
something welcome to awesome Hardware
episode 153 your watch inside a in about
an hour or so will be switching beside
be on Paul's channel youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware you can find a link to
that in the video description on my
youtube video that's my channel and this
is a fun laid-back exciting tech news
show that Paul and I like to do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
right here on Twitch on TV and our
respective YouTube channels so we'd like
to have a few drinks on occasion yeah am
I kidding every time every episode we
have a few drinks always drink beer we
encourage you to do the same if you are
of legal drinking age or you can just
drink something non-alcoholic that's
fine too only thing that can distract us
from that just endless nothingness of
existence god we crack this quick yeah
alright and then we also occasionally
get heated up and we'll swear here and
there so if you have little ones around
if you're sensitive hearing
don't be aware running yes um cursey
cursing potty mouth both Paul and I we
don't have potty mouths by nature but we
can when appropriate I do I'm a firm
believer that there is an appropriate
time yeah on occasion you have to put
some emphasis yes a little stank on it
and that's what that's where swearing
comes from I like appropriately well
time to curse words and then we also
sell stuff on our stores so if you would
like to support us you know if you'd
like to go the extra mile um you know it
on top of already watching us and liking
our videos and stuff you can pick up
something from either of our stores why
not both my store is bibliothèque slash
store yeah you'll find high quality
things all kinds of things glasses mugs
sweaters hoodies t-shirts desk mats
mouse pads it's all I like it's all
amazing Paul also has amazing quality
stuff on his store because we go through
the same merch guys so you have to sit
there and scratch your head and wonder
all those stuff is better if said the
differences is very very small but he's
got a lot of awesome stuff here 2x blood
t-shirts
RGB everything we got thumbscrew desk
mats also back in stock every friggin
thing the Sun and we will Johnson the
shit out of you see and we always get
positive feedback on the merchant people
get yeah you know yes we have very few
very few returns I will say very low
return rate on these things so I'm go
ahead and buy something from from both
of our stores and we will yell Johnson
at you at the end of the show slightly
violating oh it's gratifying let's crack
this beer shall we yeah it's getting I
like the name of this beer it's the it
just says hey yeah hey yeah where's my
beer it's a double dry hopped double
India Pale Ale it's got double doubles
it's like an in-and-out beer but they
say you're double twice your openers
little literally under a stack of CPUs
and an SSD your beers oh your beer open
air isn't here you go what my story what
a lucky opener yes bottle openers on
both of our stores but you can only find
this the thumbscrew one on on pulse it's
true let's see okay we do ship we do
ship worldwide although a worldwide
shipping can be on the more expensive
side our apologies for that fuel prices
and all this is like plastic on the cap
look at that plus you know they hire a
guy with a gun to like let's guard the
shipment the entire way the holy I might
be exaggerating about that but yeah yeah
oh yeah okay yes they are heavily
depends or arm to it it depends on you
know what all is in the order but
usually there's some protection going on
there always use protection kids all
right
let's pour the showi over here hey yo
this is a again double dry hop double
India Pale Ale with moat Wicca and
galaxy hops I'm probably butchering that
this this was sent to us by a fan when
we opened it on the awesome Hardware
live showed just before we went on
hiatus but right before Computex and
everything so I intended to look up so
we could double check and thank the fan
again who sent this in and I totally
didn't because
time before the show okay so if anyone
like right now wants to find that out
because it's in like I said the the live
show before Computex
yes maybe we could think in the person
but that would be nice regardless thank
you kind fan for sending this in I think
part of I think part of the mo here was
to have me drink some good IPAs because
I always say yes you know I don't hate
IPA but it's not my favorite mm-hmm so
it's true this I believe perhaps is a
good IPA Kyle actually opened the bottle
there it wasn't one of the quark style
bottle suit yeah yeah it's not quite -
my true tennis it had tape around there
for shipping purposes and then a you
know on a scale of one to five rows only
like a five in terms of nervous so I'm
getting better and this is from
microphone brewing in case you were
wondering 8.5% well cheers Cheers all of
you thank you so much for being here
choose to the Phoenix as this whoo
double cheers that's very tasty hmm it
is mmm that's mmm I like it that's
really really like I like guys now I'm
an IPA guy you made Paul a believer
I need more hops right there more hops
in this okay
okay um let's let's just dive right in
shall we - our and really quick shout
out to to sell that in moderator for
moderating check and my wife
wifey sauce is in the YouTube chat at
least thank you very much honey for
being here as well I know they're given
giving so a hint so oh all right our
first segment I thought I would bring
back to fund or not to fund haven't done
this one in a while it students and this
is a great yes there's gonna be a
special wearables edition no I kept
finding you know interesting items that
just happen to be wearable so I was like
you know what that's I'm just gonna turn
this into a thing I love a nice theme
turn it into a thing and
and yeah it's gonna be glorious so the
first one we have here is a wire or a
wireless not a wireless a wearable
charging cable called the Nils not a
huge fan of that acronym whatever it
stands for it's probably right there
nerd niños what's that stand for I don't
know I didn't really look for it it's by
Nordic Union so maybe it's a Nordic or
dick in inversion duction lithography
synapse synapse nailed it nailed it you
nailed it okay all right so what is this
and what does it do you shouldn't spend
too much time on this because it's
essentially a charging cable that you
can wear around your wrist like a
bracelet
oh and and I feel and I should I should
mention it's already had forty-three
thousand dollars raised of it's ten
thousand dollar goal I feel like that
figure would be doubled if their
campaign video wasn't so damn cheesy if
they actually targeted it to like nerds
and and not like this this dude and his
sappy girlfriend I don't know marketing
is absurd I reserved a cartoonist leg
shot their marketing is very important
and I think this video is super cheesy
but let's talk about the product itself
it's basically a charging cable it comes
in a variety of connectors lightning
type-c micro USB they're not interchange
which actually might end this video up
it's making my eyes bleed thank you
thank you everyone else thanks you to it
it's not interchangeable the the
connectors which I like I prefer them to
just be stuck on there and solid just by
the one you need and be done with it it
supports fast charging and it's
water-resistant so you know if you
accidentally fall into a ocean you
should be okay and yeah I think this is
a neat concept
if anyone's just in it for the like oh
my gosh
time's wasting literally five minutes to
go on the $4 pledge to get one of these
and there's six left six left Wow
better jump on that now although there
was still six left when I saw this
article earlier today that was before it
was featured super successful live
stream yes six dollars in more
and you get it's cheap though well it's
four bucks what four bucks for one six
bucks I get I mean it's it's so cheap
that it's like all right even if it's
not everything you hoped it would be
it's four bucks if you're one of the
lucky few the last six people to get one
that's a provocative image yeah I
thought that was kind of weird and
bondage II it's also not even the cable
that's being sold it doesn't really have
a whole lot I was like this is stupid
now I have to fat oh this is trying to
say the old cables which are long and
annoying and will strangle you now
that's a double double entendre there
it's saying that you're being you you're
bonded you're bound by your by your
shitty non bracelet cables interesting
marketing technique they're very very
right to tell from wholesome wholesome
coupling yeah just vanilla looking
couple in the world to like bondage and
trying to cable chains trying to cast a
wide wide net here yes fishnets
scandalous all right let's move on to
the next item here is an auto black
block turn oh well interesting
YouTube's on it we have also got or
maybe twitch we've also got the smart
belt 2.0 oh good which means that there
was at one point now at some point he
does stupid my belt is where are you
smart like oh the other cell stupid
fucking belt that would be a great
campaign video yeah is your belt
stupidest shit
why don't you ever tighten the right
alright so what's going on here
you never do math okay alright 1 million
dollars funded Jesus what for a belt ok
for a belt 1 million dollars of it's
$10,000 goal still has 16 days to go
like a million dollars wasn't in fact
this broke records this is the highest
funded fashion item in history
ok according to them so sure it's it's
on the internet it's true Senate record
that many people have sought to achieve
and
it's smart son it's on my bucket list
meld it fashionable so okay at first I
was like what kind of stupid app is this
gonna be synched up with what is there's
actually no tech involved really watch
which I kind of I'm torn with why call
it a smart belt if it's not like a pin
able or doesn't have any sort of tech
behind Bluetooth doesn't it bluetooth
doesn't have anything well it doesn't
have a calculator Paul it can't do your
math equations for you
but yet they call it a smart belt anyway
so it's kind of weird advertising I
don't know if that's the best thing for
it Lauren there but at the same time I'm
kind of relieved at the city you know
I'm kind of relieved at the same time
that it's like okay great we we really
don't need to be syncing our belts to
our smartphones now do we so what's
worried about it I mean I was excited
about the prospect of making fun of the
garbagey technology the thing that would
have been the only redeeming quality
rated smart belt so now I'm disappointed
that's true well now we can just be
enlightened by how reasonably subdued
this yeah they obviously could have
thrown some RGB and been nice though but
that'd be great you just take take
suggestion RJ shoes somebody needs so
yeah the RGB belt with RGB shoes RGB
shirts are to be pants sunglasses so
this is so basically it's the number one
thing that makes this a smart belt is
the adjustability so instead of having
like seven loophole or belt holes or
whatever that you can adjust that are
all like you know an inch or an inch or
two apart
this has third a thirty two step track
system that's 1/5 of an inch apart so
you can basically adjust it very very
accurately to your needs or and has a
very easy like quick-release mechanism
so if you wanted to just like release it
a couple notches after a big meal this
is what they are saying in the video or
like you're sitting down for like a five
hour meeting at work and you're like I'm
not wearing this belt right now this
this tightly you can just easily loosen
it without having to like do the thing
you know we've all been there it's like
I could really loosen or tighten my belt
right now but you're in public and it's
just kind of awkward it looks like
you're about to strip down and just like
pull your Wang out
all is about to do right now wouldn't be
the first time he pulled his dick right
and those are good I've been wearing the
same belt since high school yeah this is
like that no joke this belt is so old
and like it still does the same job and
it does everything that you just said
because it's it's one of the class ones
of course I used to have one so you can
connect it wherever you want Sasuke
everything cuz that's vans right when
was in its etnies one that I had four
years after high school was gonna say
and quickly broke just just like I just
did I am amazed yours is still intact
well this belt is very old I know but
I'm going to keep wearing it and you
should there's no reason you should see
you don't use a smart belt cuz yours is
already spelled was smart long has time
ago all those jokes about how stupid
your belt blows are they were all lie in
fact you've just probably just
rediscovered your your love for that
belt I'm very proud of this bill you're
welcome it's like things I haven't spent
any money on in a really long time like
haircuts belts I don't know what are
their regular expenses have I have I
saved a lot of money and over these
tangent but you die grass is so I'm
disappointed in the smart belt joke
Bluetooth but is yours made out of
Kevlar can your can your belt stop a
bullet I've never been shot in the waist
fortunately well you know the day that
you are you'll greatly regret wearing
your dumb non bulletproof all right all
right that's probably shade you got a
smart belt gonna come back it's gonna
come back to haunt me it's gonna come
back to shoot you and then finally we
have the pocket monkey
this is advertised as being a ginger
pocket I have it's the most that's the
tiniest the world's most portable
Fitness device pocket monkey it just
sounds like you jerk off in your pocket
get work out that's it that's why I'm
that's why it's beginning of this videos
really what they're implying here and
what what is this guy
carrot top with like black dyed hair he
looks like carrot top yeah I kind of do
I shouldn't I shouldn't focus too much
on his appearance but it looks like he's
about to pull out his wing but it's just
the pocket monkey um so it's basically a
gym in a portable bag for people who are
fit basically no one who watches the
show nor me or Paul I shouldn't say that
but stereotypes are funny
it's for when you're traveling on the go
when you're on the go and you still want
to get your burn on alright but you're
in the hotel room you don't to use the
hotel gym or you're you know somewhere
else
traveling cuz you're cool and never home
well you can still do these sexy
workouts and maintain your sweet bod and
flush toilet paper down the drain that
you've written on instead of these
fatties eating delicious donuts that I
kind of want right now you can be like
this guy you can be black carrot top
hair again I'm gonna stop the video yeah
you gotta you stopped it right before
the monkey working there's got a play
that is actual right now you can stop
okay so it's it's a it's a gym on the go
and yeah it's it's $100 for one
executive use elastic band it's a few
elastic bands that they're selling for
$100 you could probably make this
yourself for good just get $15 some
bungee cords and maybe some duct tape
I'm not exactly sure why it's so
expensive
a hundred dollars it doesn't you you
realize people realize they have to
actually use it like every other day for
other work right it's insanely durable
oh wow insanely insanely durable I was
hoping I was thinking it was just gonna
be super durable definitely a durability
rating that is you know it's grounded in
some sort of real scale it can be
measured and tested to prove that this
is advertising within it might as well
have said it was like spacecraft
material space grade Space Gray yeah
there's rubber bands it's
it's aircraft grade aluminum probably
too they got in there to Jesus crazy
yeah and this I feel like they would
just snap back and just there would be a
blowback effect there's gonna be
injuries there's gonna be so many
returns on this thing but it's already
got a million dollars fund any can you
believe that a million I'll take the
smart belt so if we were gonna choose
out of these three I the charging cable
around your wrist is actually pretty
pretty handy because you can just wear
it as an emergency charging cable that's
there have been times where I'm like
holy shit I could use a charging cable
right now but I'm never gonna put it in
my pocket of the around the brace limit
I would go for that
yeah cuz it's four bucks it's for buzz
odds to get one of those last six yeah a
four dollar got really weird belts all
that much so it's I mean for the least
amount of money
drew of these options so overhead and I
might actually use a journeyman cable
mm-hmm
it's very pretty okay alright that was
tough under not on those epic round of
to thunder net hell yeah run firing now
let's let's let's continue our fire
streak funded with some pimp my PC hey
but not just any kid my PC we're doing
the micro ATX Edition today folks
because I feel like micro ITX is kind of
the middle child when it comes to form
factors my Chrissy I thought you're
doing Mini ITX no micro are you chain
rule I did change it I initially put
down Mike Mini ITX when I woke up this
morning and then I was like you know
what micro ATX never gets any love they
were forgotten middle child so I thought
I would I thought it would toss him a
bone so let's let's talk about let's
talk about Donna blames no Donalbain
Donna Bane's system okay
Donnell based an extreme budget V our
computer that does really well right for
a bunch of computer cool
Adele Optiplex 390 motherboard in case
core i3 twenty one twenty eight gigs of
generic ram 1333 question mark a GTX 780
coolermaster or I'm sorry that's the CM
550 watt 80 plus power supply it's cool
a master have fun judging it oh we
certainly will
okay you have a core i3 in here
and a GTX 780 I guess yeah that would be
okay for some entry-level VR look at
those 3.5 inch drive mounts I really
like that Wow
that is sexy okay so now we today I
learned Paul is super into suspended
hard drive mounts know that just they're
so DIY and they're they're so like so
it's integrated with the existing like
floppy cage that's right there
right and then just these vertical just
I just appreciate that you know they're
spaced out a little bit for some airflow
in between true you know they're it's
making use of some otherwise dead space
in this case that's a good point
I I agree with you why not some other
things to note here is that we have well
it's hard to even begin with pimping
this PC when the components are pretty
low-end you got a green PCB motherboard
so it's right there's not a whole lot
you can do about which is a good excuse
to upgrade the whole platform you've got
a you know unpaid end unpainted interior
case there's not a whole lot you can do
about that and it's used to buy a new
case your power supply is adequate it
says it's eighty plus but why not buy a
new power supply while you're at it I
mean honestly if you were upgrading here
and you're trying to salvage something
the power supply could probably kick
kick around for another year or two yeah
you know it's not the best efficiency
rating but yeah yeah I mean drives
curious you're doing VR with this also
you said there's a GTX oh there's a 780
I'm sorry there's a picture with it out
70 these down in the bottom yeah like
there's there's just not a whole lot you
could get a bunch of zip ties and go at
the cables and try to cinch him down and
tie them back to the back here as much
as possible I mean that's that's
something good rule but then that'll
guarantee that like the power supply
dies and then you have to undo
yeah yeah I mean I I applaud this this
system because it's some you know
slightly outdated parts but using it for
a pretty modern application of VR yeah
780 can probably just barely kind of
hang with that I think you've done all
you can with this particular system yeah
and there's really no point in pimping
it the next logical step would be to
upgrade it and when I say upgrade I mean
change everything except like Paul said
the power supply and perhaps the hard
drives if they're still kicking
I mean graphics card 2 is oh yeah the
graphic starts fine you know if you
would like a nice uplift in your VR
performance then I would definitely
suggest something a little bit faster
you can still probably saw the GTX 780
for a decent price so maybe but apart
from that all right Thank You Donalbain
Ian thanks appreciate it
morris forest with two R's get it right
8700 can use e 370 g motherboard Corsair
64 gigs 2400 speed H 115 i Galactic
Empire Titan XP and Wardell Corsair RM
1,000 X capable on extensions crucial MX
300 one terabyte m2 SSD and 2 terabyte
MX 300 Wow and a 10 terabyte Barracuda
Pro with shit so this thing is pretty
stacked this is like balls to the wall
probably this fast of a gaming PC you
can get I like to start every aeration
in 2018 storage configuration yes I mean
hell yeah he's got a 1 terabyte m2 SSD
in there it's nvme he's got another 2
terabyte SSD that's two and a half inch
yeah three terabytes of SSD and 10
terabytes of hard drive at least act in
three drives 64 gigs of memory yeah this
is a high-end s system yeah so this is
like the polar opposite of the system we
just took a look at where you already
have your specs where they need to be
and you can now afford to start actually
you know
spending money on aesthetics there's
nothing more important right now that
you need to upgrade first so the system
already looks pretty good
cable management's pretty good I feel
like the wires coming off of your water
block could be tucked away a little bit
better mostly yeah I guess that kind of
stands at little this little guy what's
this little one here I don't know yeah
but even even the bigger one who looks a
little it's just very noticeable maybe
it's cuz of the flash on the camera but
just sticks out this might be for the
other fan you could push it closer push
it closer to the PCB of the motherboard
the baby try to hide it under the
heatsink there of the virial theorem
heatsink I would also say if you're into
it getting some LED fans not the clear
ones not the clear heal ones but maybe
some tasteful LED fan some of the
high-end ones you can go that extra mile
now you already got freaking Titan XP at
87 octane here I'm going to tactfully
disagree with you well you can tactfully
be wrong then do this just because it's
AG lactic Empire it's like a it's like
kind of a dark side themed red and black
and I feel like with the amount of LEDs
he has going on already like with the
lid up picture the Galactic Empire on
the graphics card and then the
wraparound with the LEDs on the top like
there's already a good amount of red
light in there you know
yeah dad the the LED fans to it might be
might be overkill I don't know I don't
know overkill sounds like sounds like
what the Empire would want doesn't it
but see like this picture here with the
side panel on you know you got kind of
it says red highlighting on everything
even even the non LED fans have this
sort of red hue but they're still black
so it's got that sort of ominous feel oh
yeah like a nice little red ring around
that fan might be cool maybe the maybe
that was fantasy fan Tex does the halos
or whatever cuz here's my thing this is
what I'm thinking right now if I did a
an entire theme system I
want the LEDs to be to do more than
static obviously I keep them all red
like he's done but I'd probably create
some kind of fun effect maybe this would
be a good opportunity for a breathing
effect I think I think the breathing red
red LED is kind of a kind of sinister
looking and I've really never found
these might already be breathing they
might be we don't know but see that's if
there's a state if there's more than
just a static effect then it could
benefit the the overall cosmetics to
have an additional little little LED
ring over there in the fan I don't know
I'm just saying I'm just saying if
you're my sister well we'll leave it to
but it looks really good to the viewers
at home to the side looks good but thank
you very much for a nice system very
nice I like it
excellent oh dude dear ad core i7 4770k
learn master hyper 212 Evo Biostar b85
motherboard 4x4 gigs of g.skill area
1600 ddr3 an EVGA GTX 760 2 gigabyte and
you've got a 120 gig 530 series SSD and
an NZXT s340 elite so thank you for the
high quality pictures by the way and the
good lighting very much appreciated yeah
they're there well done um this kind of
reminds me of my old system the hyper
212 cooler the fan looks awfully close
to the graphics card so it's just like
in taking all the hot air that's wafting
off of the card that's always what I
think when I see that configuration if
your cpu temps are totally fine then you
don't really need to do anything I also
personally from an aesthetic standpoint
like the way that the these towers look
when they're vertical as opposed to
horizontal but look the cooler master
logo is you can read the cooler master
on it this way but it's not a very
attractive faceplate for a heatsink
tower anyway so I try to even look at it
okay but opinions or opinions the other
thing here is that you have a nice black
flat black cable going to your graphics
card
ketchup and mustard for the ATX ATX
cable yes thank you chat for pointing
out ketchup and mustard you're you're
always on it and we appreciate that so
maybe get some extensions you know maybe
some extensions would do a body good
would do a PC good you also looks like
you have purple LEDs in your fans is
that just the camera mmm
I think don't they look proposed are
purple LED fans okay cuz sometimes I
mean it looks weird on camera but that
looks definitely purple to me which you
should find some purple sticks of RAM or
find some blue LED fans because I feel
like the purple and blue yeah I don't
know doesn't really match to me um I'd
like to see more white in the case to
match your graphics card because it's
just so prominently doing you could mod
the memory like cuz you don't want to
spend a lot of money on this but like
you know you can probably get a
relatively inexpensive 24 pin extension
to get rid of your ketchup and mustard
leave the GPU extension cuz that's fine
it looks a little tortured right there
where you got the the twist there the
zip tie on it but I would say get an
extension for your graphics card too
just to match okay I'm trying to get the
budget option here so screw that
inexpensive 24 pin extension and then
take see if you can heat gun off the
heat sinks are the heat spreaders on
your memory spray paint them purple to
match your fans and then everything in
this system matches pretty nicely one
last little accent take your SSD because
it's one of the Intel ones as that weird
like when they were doing the 4000
series CPUs design in the corner of it
spray paint that corner of it purple as
well
yeah I agree on everything I look nice I
agree with that
okay and maybe get a new cool okay thank
you very much thank you Andrew and your
wire and your swear 6700 K a Susie to 70
mg scaled to buy 16 gigs of 21 33
megahertz Fram
overclocked to 2666 and asus strix GT x
1080 with an h 80
may upgrade to an 280 in the future
Thermaltake V 21 and cm 200 millimeter
fan 256 gig 960 pro SSD bloody blood
blood will take 1000 watt power semi
modular power supply all right we got
here um good case I like that case it's
fun interesting placement of the case
badge here
it's like overlapping oh yes overlapping
the side panel in the front huh wonder
he was stuck to one or the other
or if it's somehow actually keeping that
closed I don't know
so you just use a thumb screw
interesting that he would have taken
this picture of the front of the system
there's all these extra cables plugged
into it you just don't give a shit yeah
I mean I can appreciate the cables
draped over the front and stuff like you
know and do that temporarily but but not
long-term you know yeah if he if he can
employ your i/o you need to you got it
you got a mess of cables going on also
this the system needs a dusting that
looks like it's been in use for a while
see bunch of dust bunnies and you've got
one of them power supplies with the red
connectors on the part and the PCI
Express graphics is that an EVGA or a
thermal take thermal tape EVGA did that
a long time back yeah Thermaltake is
probably the more common perpetrator of
that crime right just I mean I guess in
this case you could say oh it matches
with the memory but the memory is kind
of standing out not that blending it
very well either here right and it's
conflicting with the blue LED fan the
front Finny's art must be our gb you're
right it does look like it's only synced
with the graphics card right so I can
appreciate that so do the same thing
with yours if you want to get fancy and
you don't want to get like a sleeping
kit for your power supply get just
they're pretty cheap you can get one of
the pin extractors and you could replace
just the caps on your extension cables
here it's pretty easy if you're gonna go
that far see if you can get your second
cable so you can have a separate cable
for each plug and just do two of them
that'd be a fun little project it's not
too terribly difficult to do and then
that would look a lot better same
suggestion I gave for the last
submission to to maybe consider is like
a black or a matte black spray paint job
on your memory and then you get your are
jeebies
you know can do whatever they want and
that'll be your color accent and
everything else to be black then of
course dust things out and clean up all
these cables here these cables here
looking they need some work would you
would you still do two cables to the
graphics card if the only cables that
were included with that power supply
were the dual header ones it's a
thousand watt power supply so I think
there's gotta be
I would guess with the thousand watt
power supply that's probably six PCI
Express graphics power for like triple
SLI
well if there you get plugs on each one
I don't know but you're never gonna do
more than then to weigh on this system
and you're probably never gonna do
anything more than what you are
currently have so you know if you're
doing a little project and sacrifice one
of those PCI Express graphics power
cables if you got three of them you
probably at least got three of them if
not four and if you got three of them
you could sacrifice one to do that
project and you'd still have one left
over if you do add another graphics card
I'll tell you whatever really I would
snip one of those headers off yeah oh
yeah you snip it replace the other ones
me upstairs it's fun fun times gives me
the chills
alright thank you very much and then we
have one honorable mention that I just
could not resist systems yes virility PC
I just thought this was so nice looking
yeah and just a way to preheat the micro
ATX form factor
beautiful beautiful like n3 evolve ATX
modification here with that panel wooden
in front wood panel oh my god it looks
so nice oh my goodness I don't know
about airflow but but hey it looks great
and then just like the tubing and stuff
the symmetry with the yeah the
connectors yeah symmetries gorgeous
Gorge
super super Gorge this is a full-blown
show show PC and it looks like
there is maybe some airflow coming in
through the sides of the of the front
panel looks like you've got some pretty
large gaps there's obviously with this
picture you can see where the sun is
shining behind that and even lighting up
right here I know right
Suns the best source and then just yeah
that's a nice I'm a huge fan of like
horizontally mounted reservoirs like
that that are really long it's really
awesome build I wonder if this is ptg or
glass it could very well they're all
straight and I kind of like also that he
sort of fused glass or whatever with
metal tubing because there's metal
tubing on the horizontal tubes are all
met out here yeah but then the vertical
the I'm sorry that the vertical ones are
all metal and the horizontal or
something yeah it's just really really
nice like the horizontal tubes are like
mini versions of the horizontal
reservoir you thank you very much really
well done super sweet alright and that
concludes Pitt my PC yeah let's do a
quick little segment here called case
off where Paul and I argue which of
these two cases are better and they're
the same price within the price point
we're going for today is $100 the first
case that's on the line is the
Coolermaster h 500 which was actually
launched to dick ke sath a sophomore
beer will be oh well you're already
you're beating me how is that possible
when do you've been talking oh yeah
you're right no no remind me later
Windows updates go away Microsoft okay
all right you get some b-roll I'll talk
about these cases when they play this
video is Steve and his cat yes so Bo we
have provisionally we have Steve from
gamers Nexus and his the video he did
recently on the H 500 he actually
reviewed it you guys should check it out
we're gonna play this in the background
with no audio as a visual aid so you can
enjoy my voice to the you can enjoy the
sound of my voice to the replay this
deals with information from gamers Nexus
yes of course how I got their permission
in writing before the show Steve if we
ever get our streams ever get flagged
for having one of your videos in it I
will murder
you I will personally chop off those
luscious locks sir give them to your cat
your cats doing all right so the H 500
mesh and acrylic front panels are
included so you can optimize the case
for airflow or aesthetic if that's your
thing
it features to 200 millimeter RGB fans
yep let's do a sour yeah Wow
do we ever find in the name of this fan
because whoever said thank you again for
sending us this amazing beer I love
sours so the H 500 you'll notice is just
an H I've wondered M or P or whatever
without that ending suffix whatever so
it's kind of a cut-down version for 50
bucks cheaper than the H 500 P mesh for
example so it's all the extra stuff that
you don't really need or want if you're
just looking for a solid case that's
more streamlined riddler support
you get 240 or 140 at the top up to 360
or 280 at the front 120 at the rear
pretty solid pretty solid radiator uh-oh
options excuse me
it has 1/2 PSU shroud doesn't go across
the entire depth of the case kind of
stops the hard drive cage some people
are gonna hate that like why other
people will be like it's coming around
other people will be like Steve and be
like well that actually opens up a bit
more cooling for your graphics card just
based on the natural product thanks have
to cut away from damn it Steve why'd you
cut away we're trying to show the hard
drive shed oh you suck you suck at this
live editing thing Steve let's see what
other get on it
so I don't know I think the cooling in
this case actually based on the review
of the cooling in this case is pretty
damn good and you would expect it to be
because the front is just pure mash and
it's got two 200 millimeter fans the
front yeah unfortunately the RGB side
panel still has that crappy screw the
flat head screw hate the supply heads
yeah
yeah so it wasn't like it's really clean
and cool then other times like
open it without a freaking tool this
should be Julis so and there's two of
them that's even worse
no that's that's actually I didn't
notice that till just now bollocks
having two of them that's even worse but
okay a hundred dollars for this case
versus a hundred dollars for for the
relatively new NZXT th 500 ah so they're
exactly the same price bear that in mind
that all right that's almost exactly the
same product name yes this is the Battle
of the H five hundreds no kidding I do
not know I did I did I just forgot to
point it out just now but yes I was
gonna say the H rep hundred game is
strong right now now that this case is
totally different has has a few tricks
up its sleeve as well it's got a can
powered smart device built-in that we
saw at the H 700 I for example that
allows you to connect your fans your
lighting and control those things
through the cam software it can help you
piles of bamboo sticks and stuff like
that' clear aces up out of a big pile of
black sand
I have always confused when I see promo
videos with just like things like that
that aren't really nice can't tell
what's going on in zxt not artena what
the hell am I looking at oh it's okay
see that's a PC that okay I see PCs
that's not the case that's a cooler
that's a cooler that's that looks like
there's nothing wire it is what power
supplies finally sees oh there's no
second so now there's two of them and is
that literally all that's literally all
that's horrible smoke and mirrors people
smoking mirrors that's so bad video NZXT
a No I don't like it give us some more
info it's kind of artistic and
cool-looking I'm not saying it's not
cool-looking right but show me the
freaking product true Jesusita see I
think the problem was that we didn't
have the audio had we had the amazing
epic song attached all that we'd be like
ooh James Cameron direct this but ok
what else does this have besides a cam
Howard smart device that most people or
a lot of people from
one of the comments I would read them h7
how to review aren't really interested
in it has to air f2f1 41 geez I can't
words to air F 125th
so obviously you would connect both of
those to the camp our device the smart
device be able to configure all that
with him cam tempered glass side panel
that is tool this full power supply
shroud spends the entire depth of the
case unlike the H 500 reading your
support it's actually quite limited
compared to the H 500 from Coolermaster
it only has up to 240 or 280 at the
front and you can do it 120 at the rear
stupid arguably though most people these
days are only gonna need one are only
going to put one radiator in their whole
system it's probably gonna be for their
CPU unless your custom water cooling
this is not advertised as being a custom
water cooling friendly case so that's
fine in my opinion cooling in the case I
don't think the cooling in this case is
gonna be good as the H 500 it just it
just on paper the to the the cooler
master is a try 400 with the to 200
millimeter fans that's front panel I
just feel like it's gonna blow the H 500
I out of the water
with its one 120 fan at the front and
it's semi limited air flow with the the
clean front panel that looks really nice
but I think the intake is only really
coming from the top and bottom of that
panel if I remember correctly so cooling
I think has to go to the H 500 from
cooler master performance and cooling
cooling master but as far as aesthetics
I like the way this case looks
infinitely better than the cooler master
one again super subjective but the
cooling is not the cooling is objective
and I think the cooler master does a
better job so I think it really depends
to me what components am I putting in
this system am I am I putting relatively
high-end hot running how long have you
been chef what's happening here sure my
disks in my peripheral this has ryan not
to focus on you try to ignore you as i
usually do
fidgeting you just you're spitting with
something so if I was gonna put really
high-end hot running components in my
system I'd go with the cooler master H
500 if I wasn't the head go with the H
500 I you guys let us know what you
think in all right
any thoughts before we move on mr. Paul
I'd agree the practical choice is the H
500 the aesthetically beautiful choice
is the H 500 I yeah age 500 I like is as
as a practical case I think it looks
kind of awkward because the front goes
up front goes up high and then the mop
is still flat right for the handle yeah
that part looks awkward to me
yeah let's introduce this beer that I've
been struggling to open yay this finally
got it is most 2017 - 9 I don't know why
it says that
Flanders style Flanders Oh Debruyne
American wild ale with Morello cherries
Morello 6.5 percent alcohol by volume
this is the Grand Monde a wild sour so
this is a sour revering away from IPA
the PTSD kicked in
oh my god I got the head right there I
know but that was like literally I you
probably shouldn't tell Rick's it to
your IPA puts a black and tan Cheers
okay ready sure
it seems like we've both had our fair
share share of bottle opening struggles
on the show it's the theme if it's a
running theme
it's a motif a structuring motif look
how red this is it's like blood juice
well it does have cherries in it
didn't-didn't merino cherries thank you
I gave instructions on how to make blood
juice didn't I on the show recently I
did I remember that vaguely
I probably intentionally block that out
of my memory good old me
ooh it smells like a sour I'm very
excited very excited all right we should
move on though to share two news because
ahead yeah this is a long ass running
side so far um fortunately I think I
only have five stories I'll go through
these quickly five I'll go through these
put my god Kyle alright gigabyte
gigabyte this is an article from hexxus
which was originally pulled from digit x
gigabyte hosted a conference with its
investors recently and basically warned
them basically said that hey the
graphics card the demand for graphics
card graphics cards has actually been
weakening so it might affect revenues in
the future just so you guys know and
gigabytes actually predicting that GPU
shipments are gonna drop up to 20% in in
you know after q2 for this 2018 report
as a result in response gigabytes also
considering dropping their their average
selling prices by 10%
as a result which means that GPU is at
least from gigabyte according to
officially here it could drop around 10%
which is good like this white and orange
one here and so you might be wondering
why why is why is why is there such a
weakened demand for GPUs all of a sudden
they were like tip top at the beginning
of the year well a lot of you guys also
know the exchange rate for a lot of
popular crypto currencies has also kind
of tanked or stagnated or gone down as
of around April of this year and so
the profitability of mining is not as
much of a draw when the value of Bitcoin
or aetherium is not what it was the
beginning of the year so it makes sense
that people aren't interested in
graphics cards as much right now I'm
gigabytes GPU sales are expected to be
around 1 million dollars in q1 that's
1/5
I'm sorry not with 1 million dollars but
yeah the sales are expected to be around
1 million dollars in q1 that's 1/5 lower
than its q1 sales are QQ sales figure no
wait oh there's a typo around 1 billion
dollars in q2 which is 1/5 lower than
its q1 sales of 1.2 million dollars and
it could drop beyond that even so to
avoid to try and avoid any big losses
gigabyte is they said that their little
conference that they're gonna focus more
on promoting graphics cards for gaming
devices specifically and not really
targeting minors anymore because they're
not really the the go-to audience as of
now with cryptocurrency kind of in a rut
at the same time they're gonna be lowing
there a ESPYs or their their pricing so
they're gonna have to you know say
goodbye to their 49% margins that we're
making
they were making it they were may number
40 they were getting 49% margins early
2018 those are some huge gains and
they're gonna have to say goodbye to
those as they lower their pricing to
meet the lower demand of their products
other admin board partners are likely to
follow suit asus msi asrock known as
rock EVGA and so forth they're probably
gonna have to follow suit their stocks
are probably gonna drop in a price chart
makes graphics card I okay sure way to
be current Paul we paid some AMD cards
dropping the knowledge and then you know
so ok sure the GPU market is super
saturated and we're still waiting on new
products from AMD and NVIDIA maybe we'll
get some Nvidia action around the corner
in August who knows but as of now it's a
supersaturated market and there haven't
been any really new products and the GPU
market so stock prices are bound to fall
at some point and
and board partners are mean the same
boat as gigabyte which is good for us
because if that if they're in the same
boat as gigabyte that means they'll also
be dropping their prices which means
lower GPU prices for everyone at some
point eventually so so they're all in
the same boat and the boat is sinking
and the boat is sinking which means it's
good for us we get to step on the boat
to hop across to PC building lit the
corpses Haven short and this in this
metaphor that's what we'd be doing that
is genius genius metaphor Paul that
makes so much sense
and speaking of sense let's talk about
Intel's ninth gen core CPUs being
officially listed that's nothing to do
with sense in the core i5 9600 K and so
forth this is an article from WCC F Tech
there was an official listing on the
micro code revision guidance documents
that revealed 9th gen core family and
the fact that it is upon us this will be
based on you had this dramatic pause it
as I that's waiting for the follow up
and that's that's just you delivered
that wasn't okay well the dramatic pause
was more so just to let my brain load
more so than like some epic statement
tomorrow or have a buffering thing that
is buffering like wait for this next
words the next few about to drop on your
face big mystery change your life
forever I'm going to go to the best so
this is basically the same coffee like s
microarchitecture that we saw last year
it's more or less a refresh it's not the
most exciting thing we've seen from
Intel they confirmed however by listing
seven unreleased nitrogen core processor
SKUs which will arrive later this
quarter so it's right around the corner
they'll range from I threes to I 5s to I
7s and finally up to I 9s this is the
first mainstream launched with an i-9 in
it nine these which I guess is kind of
exciting the seven SKUs five of these of
the seven SKUs that Intel kind of just
handed out to us recently five of them
are core i5s all this
and the other two are quarry threes so
officially listed now we have an i-5
9600 K an i-5 9600 I five ninety five
hundred five ninety four hundred I five
ninety four hundred T those are all the
I fives and on the I three ninety one
hundred and I three ninety one hunt
I broke I three ninety one hundred twice
there's a ninety six hundred K okay so
maybe there's an i3 scroll down what are
the what's the other i3 that I missed or
no this is a micro code update so this
is referencing all all the CPUs that are
supported by that microcode update which
are seeing lots of different ones but
amongst the existing CPUs or like 8000
series CPUs are scattered all the 9000
series ones I only wrote down one of the
i3 9000 series though oh I three nine
hundred nine thousand sorry okay so it's
worth noting that all the i-5 parts I
just mentioned again all of the i-5
parts I just mentioned are going to be
six core with G - I'm sorry gt2 graphics
while all the core i3 parts that I
mentioned are going to be quad cores
with the same graphics configuration WCC
F Tech ultimately a better chart to look
at for just intense that's perfect
though you see CF Tech also lists to
high-end chips they already knew of from
their previous report which includes the
I $9.99 hundred K that's gonna be the
Big Kahuna eight core 16 thread part and
then there's gonna be the i7 9700 case
excessive to the 8700 K which is a lowly
six core twelfth red part
official specs reveal a two hundred
megahertz boost in clock speeds with
these with the quinine and core i7 I
just listed compared to previous and the
power management optimizations will be
there to allow for either similar or
even better overclocking performance
with the next-gen the 9900 K octa-core
is most definitely a response to two
AMD's Rison seven 2700 X and even the
1800 X that one's that one's still in
the rumor category and still more or
less in the rumor category all all this
technically is in the room
Gouri a micro code update is a little
bit more firm you might say cuz that's
not the type of thing that somebody
would have the resources to go and fake
or something like that so you like in
this hour it's just it's very sour oh my
god it's so good I love it's very sour
I'm such a sour person okay mmm so yeah
okay just just just want to point point
that out
nope but that's that's a very good thing
to point out Paul people don't get too
excited take certain things that we say
here with a grain of salt in terms of
the i9 i7 listings and the specs that
are following but you can also expect a
refreshed z9b platform to be released
alongside the knife gen core family
which is pretty cool we talked about
that last week that was maybe canceled
the refresh the z3 90 the fact that
would be oh the whole thing in general
well it would still be z3 90 there would
be like a z3 70 gen 2 or something
something to that effect but the we had
heard the z3 90 as a name might not be
Oh as the name no or they might not be
doing a new Z 390 chipset that's
manufactured on a 40 nanometer process
because of manufacturing constraints
right it might just be an updated back
requirement for of z3 70 right that
requires z3 70 motherboards to have
add-on ships that provide the same
features that like be 360 and H 370 have
yeah such as USB 3.1 gen2 and 802 mm and
AC yes which kind of sounds like a
refresh I think I got all that right
that all sounded good yeah it sounds
good to me
ok cool as long as it sounds good yeah
it's probably right sounds great um so
that's exciting we all look forward to
later this quarter when we see some
nitrogen core CPUs launch competition is
good obviously it's gonna be more of a
refresh this time around no crazy
microarchitecture changes but you know
we should still see a nice little bump
in performance overclocking abilities
and stuff like that so good stuff
next up we can talk about WCF star WCF
text article on the right
three 2300 X which is a quad-core CPU
having its benchmarks and overclocking
details late riser brazen three Verizon
three yes what this is the resin three
2300 X that we're talking about here so
it's on the low end its sub 150 dollars
us we're looking anywhere between 120
and 140 dollars why is it rising three
if it's a 2000 series because 2002 is
still the second generation two
indicates that its second generation
Rison doesn't it so Verizon 383 and 2300
X in my minds are self-defeating is it
Rison to what Rison to is 12 nanometers
instead of 14 nanometer it's no it's
like just like we had first gen rising
want or a verizon 3 this is the
successor to first generation 3 this is
rising Oh God
second gen rise in 320 300 X okay you've
clarified that formula okay let's
proceed oh yeah yeah that'd be like you
saying why is it called core i5 when
it's the sixth generation yeah I was
confusing yeah
rising through your is second generation
to third generation resin and I don't
blame you at all because every year
should get way more convoluted used
every year it gets pretty more
convoluted yeah
Paul was drunk apparently in check no
I'm it's been clarified now every we're
back on track everything is good the
world is falling apart so this is this
is actually a very interesting
proposition the Rison 320 300 X is gonna
be a quad-core no SMT unfortunately so
you're not gonna get eight courses still
gonna be four threads but sub 150 us
people are expecting this to be as cheap
as a hundred and twenty dollars that is
damn good for a quad-core CPU backed by
the rise in name it's gonna be a great
value hopefully competing with the price
here I 570 600 K which I think that chip
is probably going to slaughter it in
terms of IPC and whatnot 3.5 gigahertz
base with a four point
zero gigahertz boost but let's talk
about the actual benchmarks that were
leaked from chip hell that show more
leaks than the previous report from WCC
of tech this was tested on a Biostar X
370 racing board results are showing
performance between a core i3 8100 and a
core i3 83 50k this is while the CPU was
overclocked I believe to 4.3 gigahertz
actually the user was able to take it
beyond just beyond 4.3 gigahertz
at one point three eight volts using a
high-end liquid cooler he said that that
was required to hit that that those
numbers the 2,300 X and the B 450 boards
should be appearing very soon the launch
is right around the corner we don't know
exactly when but it's coming soon
so I think I think that's actually
pretty damn good a core i3 8100 I 3 8100
right now goes for a hundred and twenty
dollars and the 83 50k goes for about a
hundred and seventy depending on where
you look so I mean he'll if it's closer
to the 83 50k that it is the 80 100 I
would say it's a damn good deal and the
fact that you can overclock this you
would have to pay the 170 dollars to get
an overclockable case q Intel chip
whereas if it were 120 dollar AMD chip
you can still overclock it to apparently
over 4.3 gigahertz which is it's pretty
good it's something that the 8100 the i3
8100 just can't do um so it's exciting
you get a lot of other cool features
with second gen rising right like
improved a precision boost and exit far
and things like that so we look forward
to testing those out testing that chip
out as it comes comes to light so let's
move on to our second to last story here
which is about Google potentially
planning a gaming platform that a was to
compete with the Xbox and the
PlayStation this is big news this is
from
Kotaku Jason Schreyer I yeah okay so
Jason Schreyer apparently has broken a
lot of news stories in the past that
have turned out to be very legitimate
and valid and stuff so this isn't just
fluff necessarily but still it's
preliminaries to take it with a grain of
salt anyway just because there are
sources saying that Google is planning
to break into the video game industry
with its own gaming platform and there
are sort of three pillars to this
platform that we know of right now the
first of which is that it's going to be
it's gonna involve gaming streaming very
much like Nvidia's GeForce now the
second is that there is still going to
be some hardware based device in your
home that allows for this process to
happen but that takes advantage of the
streaming element and the third is that
Google's is gonna make a strong attempt
to bring game developers under their
umbrella under the Google umbrella
either through aggressive recruiting or
major acquisitions which is definitely
interesting at GDC back in March and
most recently III Google was actually
having private meetings with a lot of
big developers not just to gauge their
interest in working with them on this
platform to make develop games
exclusively for her Google station or
whatever the hell you want to call it
their code naming it Yeti at the moment
but to potentially talk in acquisition
could you imagine if Googlebot like Epic
Games or something and maybe that's what
they have to do because Google doesn't
really know anything about game
development or how to build a gaming
console from the ground up but the fact
that they're going the streaming route
they definitely know how to cloud if I
think Google would have a better chance
of doing a streaming gaming service than
Nvidia even but they don't have the
resources to make a badass exclusive
game that's gonna make people want to
invest in their ecosystem and their
platform so that's why they need to
potentially look into acquiring these
big developers so it's very interesting
certain other challenges like internet
bandwidth right to stream a game to
actually have it at like a reasonable
quality that people aren't gonna bitch
about you're gonna need some really good
bandwidth for uploading and downloading
huge data potentially maybe this might
be an opportunity to integrate for
Google to integrate their own Google
Fiber service with with the gaming
platform because that can obviously take
advantage of of those speeds and you
know and and be able to run games no
problem via the interwebs at the same
time there's also the game issue that I
talked about are there gonna be enough
awesome Google exclusive titles for
people to swap switch over from their
Playstations and their Xboxes waving
their PC like a Halo or a Mario bruh yes
they need they need some good-ass
content not some like Android based game
that you can probably get on your phone
that's just gonna be fun for ten minutes
so that's I think that's the biggest
challenge honestly out of this list and
then Google also has a reputation as the
article is saying of starting and
abandoning their initiatives Google
glass anyone there are a lot of
initiatives that Google gets very
ambitious about but never quite never it
never quite materializes into a finished
product so it remains to be seen how
this is all gonna go the nice thing is
that whatever hardware based solution
that they're gonna offer is probably
gonna be relatively cheap and low
powered I would think because they're
gonna be offloading all the rendering to
off-site system since this is a
streaming platform so that's kind of
cool I don't think they're gonna try to
compete with Xbox and PlayStation in
terms of console specs they're gonna go
a slightly different route and stream
everything and have a more low powered
entry level more cost-effective console
to put in people's homes but I guess
more on that when we know more details
so so if Google came out with something
like a chromecast that you could buy for
somewhere in the $5,200
that you plug into an HDMI port on your
computer and then has like controller -
that comes with it it just connects
wirelessly and suddenly you can stream
and play games from the Google service
exactly you know of whatever library
they put together - this little device
yeah yeah I mean I could see that being
a viable alternative to consoles and
gaming pcs yeah
but I'm in a lot of it comes down to
price and ends playability and right
latency yes how good how much of it
actually relies on your you having a
solid internet connection right but see
what happens it's also kind of
interesting like when you consider that
Google owns YouTube and how they might
integrate that with their platform more
strongly than anything existing YouTube
owns Google no Google owns eg because
everyone's YouTube yes alphabet someone
alphabet owns YouTube alphabet owns all
of them knows the world so somewhere in
the article it mentioned that you could
potentially have some YouTube
integration with the Google platform
where your gaming and you're like I
don't know that's a level that's hard to
beat you can instantly bring up like a
walkthrough guide on on YouTube and have
it overlaid with your game so you can be
gaming while watching YouTube at the
same time in a very like seamless
integration instead of having to like
open up your laptop or go to your
desktop to look up a quick walkthrough
or something like that I thought it was
kind of interesting I think I think the
just the fact that we would be streaming
games as opposed to having them on discs
or whatever would change everything I
think would change pretty much
everything so it'll
you're seeing to see if it if it
actually happens and then finally let's
just move on to our last article because
we're super late now EVGA released two
new GTX 10 50 cards recently these are
actually three gigabyte cards as opposed
to two gigabyte cards like the original
so they offer increased vram first of
all article from overclock 3d net it
offers increased vram to 3 gigabytes
obviously more CUDA cores if you get the
higher-end 1050 model and higher clock
speeds than the existing 2 gigabyte
variant the catch there is a catch
because these cards are accommodating
the 3 gig frame buffer they're also
gonna have to suffer a 25% reduction in
memory bandwidth so you're kind of
upgrading and downgrading the card at
the same time which makes you kind of
wonder what the heck is the point and
I'm very curious to see the reviews on
these cards how they stack up to the
original gtx 1053 gigabyte cards in
certain specific applications where
either frame buffer is needed or memory
bandwidth is needed based on those
priorities to see what the real-world
consequences are of a 25% reduction in
memory bandwidth even if you have that
additional gig in frame buffer so it's
kind of a confusing card from what the
article states and from just what I can
what I can perceive at the moment the
two Spears that EVGA is launching is the
gtx 1050 gaming 3 big that's kind of
like the base and then the gtx 1050
gaming SC or superclocked also 3 GAE
that superclocked version will have a
higher base and boost clock and and will
actually have higher CUDA core 768 CUDA
cores which is the same same CUDA core
count as the EVGA GTX 1050 TI 4 gigabyte
card so but still will have that 25%
reduction in memory bandwidth so it'll
be interesting interesting to see the
the in-game side effects of the
reduction of memory bandwidth I'm sure
there will be lots of testing on it
I wouldn't be surprised of gamers Nexus
have a really good in-depth vehicle
video or article for it I said vertical
and and you did say that and and to see
if the extra gig of frame buffer makes
up for that reduction in memory
bandwidth I'm not sure but yeah did did
the GTX 1050 even need a new variant of
itself in the first place I'm not sure I
think I think I really think vendors are
just like kind of twiddling their thumbs
and getting antsy they're getting antsy
because nvidia and AMD in this case
nvidia hasn't come out with a card in
like two years
it's ridiculous just looking for looking
products to fill the gap yeah let's just
let's make the GTX 1051 it's got one
more coup de coeur it's a plus one it's
a benefit yeah that's a that's feature
so that's my side of the show guys
we still have Johnson's and and stuff oh
yeah do we want to say that for your
half at least the Johnsons maybe or here
we could okay or how about this how
about we do Johnston's
right now but then we'll save donations
for your half does that work okay
okay let me see if we have any Johnsons
Oh some big old long Johnson's holy moly
okay that's the Nick today he's just
happy to be here as me oh no I actually
have very few Johnston's which is I'm
kind of thankful for because we're tight
on time here thank you very much Eric
Johnson to Eric for picking up an
awesome hardware Star Wars black t-shirt
Alexandra evolution gaming desk bat who
the evolution gaming desk mats are one
of my favs
very very very good choice Johnson to
you and that's all for me now I got the
night Emma Johnson attracted everyone
who know I have one Johnson for Alex in
Alexandria
that's a double John Johnson double J
thank you for that got the gaming desk
mat glorious glorious thank you so much
for tuning in to this half this half of
Awesome part or don't go anywhere
because it's the second half on Paul's
channel or if you're on Twitch to stay
where you are
Tim and if you're watching this after
the fact I would really appreciate some
timestamps that would be amazing you
could just drop those in the comments
and I will pin it and all stuff and
everything will be great
also like the video and all that contest
so guys thank you very much for tuning
in don't go anywhere ok guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
