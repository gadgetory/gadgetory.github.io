freak leak accident doesn't it when in
reality it's only been a couple months
since that traumatic event and since
then the system's been completely
disassembled by yours truly and I've
assessed the damage to be so severe that
it's unlikely that I'll ever reassemble
the system to its previous condition
which is quite sad obviously but don't
shed any tears just yet because I kind
of wanted to take this opportunity for
this video to talk about hotline 2.0 and
give you guys a glimpse at the direction
that I'm planning to take and the parts
that I may potentially use for the
legendary pcs successor the PC 3 7x
gaming headset from a strop and
Sennheiser brings you into the game with
an open back design featuring angled
drivers for pinpoint locational accuracy
be heard clearly through the fold-down
noise cancelling mic and enjoy the long
lasting comfort of large plush velvet
ear pads now available in an all matte
black finish so the headset looks as
good as it sounds for more info click
the link in the description and catch
the drop before it's gone now before I
start rattling off a bunch of parts that
I want to use for this build because
that's mainly what this video is about
there are a couple key points I want to
mention before we dive into it since one
of the main objectives of this 2.0 build
is to pay homage to the first hotline I
really want to incorporate a similar
look and feel in order to showcase
certain aesthetic choices that made the
original build so unique with that in
mind however we're gonna see a huge
overhaul with the actual components
being used because the original hotline
was built around two years ago and so
now we have this new wave of current gen
hardware that will be swapping out for
all the original parts
this will make hotline 2.0 a faster more
powerful and more expensive build in the
end as far as color scheme goes I'm
probably gonna stick with hot pink and
gray but this time around I'm gonna add
a splash of teal or turquoise just to
switch things up a bit I've always been
a huge fan of the hot pink and teal
color scheme it's also a pretty
prominent color scheme in the video game
hotline Miami which is a game that AI
was obsessed with around the time that I
was building hotline and also be the
video game that gave me the inspiration
to name the PC hotline in the first
place so paying a bit of omage to the
game I guess in that sense and also just
because I really like that color combo
obviously there aren't many pink in
EAL components on the market so it's
gonna be a challenge for me to sort of
tie in these funky colors into the build
organically but I do have a few ways of
doing that depending on the fluid that I
choose
there's RGB lighting of course custom
cables leaving and even doing custom
paint jobs hopefully all of those
elements will be enough for me to tie
together a working color scheme for this
build another important thing to note is
that some of the parts in this build
will actually be carried over from the
end through elite system that I put
together several months back and there's
nothing wrong with that build the elite
build will always have a special place
in my heart but it's just to overkill
and cumbersome for my personal needs and
it's just been sitting there I haven't
booted it in months and it's really sad
for me to see such a beautiful high-end
system just sitting there so I'm gonna
tear it to pieces the specs of hotline
2.0 are not gonna be a carbon copy of
the elite build by any means but do
prepare to see some close similarities
last thing I want to mention before we
move on is that the parts list I'm about
to share with you guys is subject to
change nothing is set in stone just yet
and there are a number of factors that
could potentially sway the items on this
list factors such as any compatibility
issues that pop up that are unforeseen
at the moment it could be that I have a
change of heart at some point and want
to swap certain parts out for whatever
reason and even the feedback that you
guys leave on this video after watching
it from start to finish could
potentially change the items on this
list so I just want to make that very
clear for our case I'm very strongly
leaning towards fractals - fine r6 the
moment for a couple reasons for starters
it is a nice successor to the define s
which was used for the original hotline
but has a lot of the modernized features
that the define s lacked such as a
tempered glass side panel and the power
supply shroud to name a few it's also
just a great case overall in terms of
build quality and the building
experience I've already assembled two
systems inside this chassis I've been
really happy with it
and to top things off it's got a lot of
potential when it comes to custom water
cooling so I think all of those reasons
combined make this a super strong
contender for a hot line 2.0 case the
processor I'm choosing is actually one
of the few components that I'm carrying
over from the end through elite build
this is the Intel Core I 979 ATX II and
this particular chip is the one that I
had deleted by Steve from gamers Nexus
where he was able to drastically cut
down on the low temperatures as well as
improve upon the power efficiency of the
79 80 X II so yes it's an insane CPU
with 18 cores and 36 threads at its
disposal on LGA 20 66 which i think is a
nice throwback to the x99 platform that
was used with the original hot line
build the motherboard I picked is the
Asus tough X 299 mark 1 and I selected
this board for a couple reasons for
starters when it comes to Asus x2 99
boards I feel like this particular model
doesn't get as much attention as a lot
of the other flagship boards do and so I
kind of like the idea that this board
hasn't been seen in many builds yet at
least by me additionally the original
hot line build used the Asus saber-tooth
x99 board so it has a very similar
design language as this one and finally
the fact that we're using thermal armor
here gives us a lot of play when it
comes to customization and doing a
custom paint job essentially being able
to remove that armor do whatever we want
with it and then placing it back on the
board without much fuss is very
appealing to a modification noob like
myself now when deciding what I was
gonna choose from memory I was really
debating back and forth of my head
whether or not I was gonna use RGB
memory because RGB memory was not nearly
as prevalent a couple years ago as it is
now now it's almost inescapable but you
can see here that I've clearly caved and
thrown all my morals out the window as I
will be going the RGB memory route after
all with a kid of Corsair Vengeance RGB
Pro this is a 64 gig 8 by 8 gig kit ddr4
at 3000 megahertz speed this kit was
first unveiled and shown off at copy
text earlier this year just just a
couple weeks ago I liked the way they
looked the LEDs looked really bright and
there's 10 LEDs per module so the
transition and gradient is very smooth
and seamless they look like really good
sticks and I do trust the coarser name
when it comes to performance and
reliability as well so very excited to
be using this in the build for our
graphics cards I'll once again be
borrowing from the enfili build a pair
of asus rog Strix GT x 1080 TI OC
editions which are fantastic cards
they're incredibly fast factory
overclocked 11 gigs of gddr5 x i cannot
speak highly enough about these cards
though of course have custom water
blocks on them so you won't be seeing
the the fancy air cooler that you see
here in the picture but then there's
also the potential of the gtx 1180 s
just around the corner and so I was
faced with this decision of do I build
now the existing
hardware that I have on hand or do I
hold out for the next generation of
geforce cards and I'm choosing to build
now I'm gonna choose to build now with
the strong possibility of upgrading
these 1080p is for either 1180 s or 1180
T eyes if those are around the corner as
well when the time comes also recycled
from the elite build will be the edimax
plateau max D f-series 1200 watt power
supply it's 80 + Platinum certified
fully modular this thing is an absolute
animal it's incredibly reliable backed
by the NR max name and the fan is also
incredibly quiet in fact it doesn't even
spin up unless you're around 30 to 40
percent load or higher fans fans fans
hotline 2.0 is gonna need a lot of fans
even though it's a water-cooled system
you still need fans to dissipate the
heat that's being absorbed by your
radiators and fin stacks and exhaust hot
air outside of your case in general so
for that task I'm employing the fractal
design venturi HP 12 pwms which did such
a great job in the first hot line that I
would expect no less of them this time
around as well so for our boot drive we
have one of Samsung's newest nvme m2
SSDs this is their 970 Evo in a 250 gig
capacity which will be blazing fast in
terms of load times and overall
snappiness of the system will be pairing
that with one of Samsung's 2 terabyte
960 pro nvme SSDs some of you guys
probably recall me putting two of these
in raid zero in the elite build and
clearly one of them will be carried over
to hotline 2.0 to be used for mass
storage maintaining some of the Flair
and illumination of hot line 1.0 I'll be
bringing back the NZXT hue plus which
still till this day is one of my
favorite RGB lighting systems mainly
because of all the cool effects that you
can do and the fact that NZXT is
regularly updating the cam software and
adding new features to it overall makes
me really happy to see it return for
this build here's a quick look at the
high bandwidth sli bridge that I plan to
use which is the asus rog model with
fancy or sync RGB lighting and it's kind
of funny the original Hotline build had
asus graphics cards but an EVGA sli
bridge because I didn't have a nicer
bridge on hand at the time and I never
bothered swapping it out later down the
line with an Asus one so here's my
chance to redeem myself
finally the cards and the bridge will be
from the same manufacturer
any curse the PC gods placed over me
years ago we'll finally be lifted now we
can move on to all the custom water
cooling hardware which just a heads up
is gonna be mostly from ek water blocks
because a that's the brand that was used
for hotline 1.0 and B they seemed really
down to support this project and I'd
love to work with them again for for
hotline successors so here we have the
water block which is exactly the same
water block that I used for 1.0 it's the
ek supremacy Evo in black it's a single
construction and all that I'm actually
gonna use the exact same block if I can
there's no reason why I can't just use
the same block and I probably don't even
need to ask them for a new one because
it is still in working condition we will
have to order some fresh GPU blocks
however as we are using a different GPU
layout this time around
these are eks GTX 1080p ice tricks
Edition nickel plated copper water
blocks with acetyl tops and these will
be pairing very nicely with some Strix
branded back plates super plain and
simple also some Strix branding at the
bottom right corner there by the ek logo
and then radiators we'll be putting two
radiators in hot line 2.0 very much like
1.0 however instead of having a 360 and
a 240 like the original we'll have two
360 radiators this time around for
starters we have an ek cool stream SC
360 this is a slim rad at 28 millimeters
thick that we'll be placing on the top
of the system at the top of the case
just because we have a little bit more
clearance issues when it comes to ram
and vrm heat sinks and things like that
then we do at the front of the case
where we can afford a much thicker
radiator at 60 millimetres with one of
these cool stream xe3 60's here's the
pump res combo I was considering its the
ekx res 140 DDC 3.2 pwm elite and it's a
tried-and-true option there's definitely
higher-end pumps to be had from ek such
as their D 5 series but I believe those
pumps are also thicker at their base
this is a very slim profile and that's
one of the reasons why it's tentatively
on this list is because I'm planning to
fasten this pump res to the system with
this bits power premium reservoir mount
that mounts to the radiator or your
radiator fans and so this would actually
mount to the front radiator fans of the
case and I'm afraid that by using an ek
d5 pump that it would cause clearance
issues with the radiator
using this mounting solution but I'm not
sure if it doesn't then I'm all for
using the d5 but assuming that does
cause some clearance issues I'm probably
gonna use this DDC pump instead but you
guys let me know if you have any
experience using an e kd5 pump with this
particular mount and it doesn't run into
clearance issues with the radiator then
I'll probably go the d5 route so it
really just depends and finally I will
once again be using hard line PE TG
tubing for this system which means I'll
be doing all the bends and runs myself
as I usually do with the help of eks
compression fittings so really exciting
stuff I think that's everything
Wow I feel like I've been talking
forever my throat's like sore now so
those are all the parts and ideas that I
currently have in mind for hot line 2.0
and at this point I really just want to
hear from you guys I want your honest
feedback to help me make this the best
possible successor to good ol hot line I
know a lot of you guys have watched me
build hot lines since day one and have
fallen in love with that system as much
as I have and that leads me to believe
that a lot of you are just as
emotionally invested in this project as
I am so I want you guys to be an active
part of the process so I'm very much
looking forward to hearing everything
you guys have to say in the comments but
that's it for me guys go ahead and toss
a like on this one if you enjoyed it get
