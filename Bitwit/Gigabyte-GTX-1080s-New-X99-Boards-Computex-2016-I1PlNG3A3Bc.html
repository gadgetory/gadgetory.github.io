computex 2016 has been overclocked by
gigabyte fantex cable mud ng scale
making the contents of this video highly
unstable click the links in the
description for more info what's up guys
welcome i'm at the get my booth right
now here in Taipei worth the taipei 101
building it's crazy it's good they got a
lot of good stuff here actually
motherboards included I've just been
introduced to their new designee airline
which I never mess up the pronunciation
of what essentially these boards are
targeted towards our high-end
workstation machines so gaming's awesome
we all know that but there's a lot of us
who game who also like to create content
for example me or pulp a guy behind the
camera right now so in that situation
some kind of a workstation board like
this lineup from designee r would make a
lot of sense so we've actually got three
varieties three flavors if you will
including the gaz 170 x designee r this
is kind of you know very competitively
christ but also has a lot of really good
features like you to it's got em too
nbme pcie x 4 of course three point oh
so it's got a lot of cool stuff i really
like the aesthetic it's kind of
minimalistic it's not too far out there
and aggressive or what have you so if
this is kind of the thing you're going
for this could be a really good option
i've also got the gaz 170 x ud3 ultra
now basically i think the ultra just
means it's got really nice looking
covers on the heat sinks and stuff
because um we've actually kind of seen
this in the the previous generation of z
170 boards from gigabyte the non
designee but they're sticking with that
same theme except we've got blue now
there's the blue accents and there's
also blue LEDs now I didn't want to
point out that you also get the same
LEDs on this board as well except it's
just not powered on right now there's
another plug you can actually get
additional LEDs through the dimm slots
as well so if you really want to
blinged-out system that's with maybe
like a blue and white colour scheme this
would be a good option pretty much all
the same features that we found on the
the z1 70x back there except you get
kind of a nice beefed up aesthetic and
then finally moving on this is our non Z
174 this is an x 99 featuring or
supporting the new broadwell chips from
Intel this is a really cool board it's
just got the beef doubt same sort of
aesthetics here blue and white theme
going on I really like this cover plate
for the m2 I think it's a really nice
touch you've got 3-way SLI or crossfire
support and by the way you could do
three way by 16 on every slot and that's
thanks to it an add-in plx bridge that
you couldn't do previously without one
so that's a really cool feature as well
be sure to stay tuned for more tech
stuff coming real
soon at the gigabyte booth in fact why
don't we go I see some stuff over there
let's go over there I'm not done yet I'm
not done let's go let's keep going
alright guys so one of the things I
forgot to mention about the motherboards
back there is that they all integrate
Thunderbolt three support and because of
that gigabytes really moving forward
with creating a good Thunderbolt 3
ecosystem for their line of board so
with that you actually have this product
right here which is the gigabyte GPT bt3
box what this essentially does is allows
you to connect a single Thunderbolt
three cable from your PC to this little
box here and it's just got a smorgasbord
of ports all over it so that you can
actually connect pretty much any you
know external device that you might need
so I'm just going to go down the line
right really quick we've got micro SD
and a regular SD card USB 3 USB 3.1
type-a you've got you
but microphone jacks they're moving on
to the back you've got an rj45 lan ports
six USB 3 ports you get to Thunderbolt
three ports as well displayport hdmi ps2
and a frickin power connector so all
together this is a really useful thing
oh I almost forgot about this envia nvme
pci e m2 SSD slot right here in the
bottom a little screwy just pop that out
you can connect that right externally
from your desk straight to your PC so
pretty sweet i'm going to be taking this
i'll see you guys later so we just
talked about some of the workstation
designate boards over there but they've
also got gaming boards as well here at
the gigabyte suite of course so we've
got four different varieties right here
and these are pretty much again more
targeted towards the the hardcore gamer
in all of us you get the phoenix sli the
ultra gaming another ultra gaming these
are both 0 this is he 170 these these
ones on top or x99 have even gotta be
150 for the more budget oriented gamer
but pretty much good features all around
you can see that some of the boards
actually have RGB LEDs on them of course
there's not a live demo here but you can
see some of the LEDs underneath the PCIe
slots and the dimm slots as well not
pictured is the actual LEDs going
between the dimm slots themselves which
looks really cool you can see we've got
some orange plating here on the phoenix
sli this is kind of an all blacked out
board which i think would look would do
really well with any kind of
configuration and then we've also got
RGB LEDs on the X i9 ultra gaming as
well look gasps gigabytes got video
cards this is a GTX 1080 g1 gaming
pretty sweet it's completely different
shroud design than we've seen on the
wind forest coolers for example it's got
some orange action to the front here got
three fans fans are good yo azz fans on
a video card you've actually got an RGB
LED branding on the front here so it
says gigabyte and also fan stop I
believe that's RGB as well there's an
earthquake right now it's good thing I
was holding this graphics card isn't it
resume coverage so basically we've got
RGB LEDs fan stop means the the fans
will just completely stop dero RPM when
it's idling they only spin up under load
it's great for acoustics and stuff like
that we also got an 8-pin pcie connector
back plate so it looks like a brushed
aluminum metallic sort of back back late
i'm not sure but it's definitely not
plastic which is a good sign they've
also got the you've also got another
video card back there which is a
more more high-end however I it's in use
right now all right to jerks this is the
extreme gaming all right this is even
more of a badass card they're both
badass but this is just the gtx 1080
with a more beefy cooler on it you can
see here it's got three fans they're
much larger and they're actually kind of
overlapping the fan in the middle so I
guess that provides more even coverage
across the radiator better cooling that
sort of thing it's also got this X kind
of shaped design on the cooler there's
actually LEDs on each of the the X
bracket things those are our RGB LED
supported as well as the RGB stuff on
the front here with more branding again
fans thought you get an awesome back
plate with some orange some orange
accents there there's a bit of orange
accent on the the other side the
underbelly as well as on the front the
front plate of the card as well but
check this out it's got two 8-pin PCIe
connectors so definitely this bad boy is
going to be awesome for overclocking
things like that and you've also got the
standard configuration of display io on
the back and yeah look at this look at
this hdmi why are there two HDMI ports
on the front of the video card as
important as opposed to the back for
example this is for VR so if you have
like a 5-2 quarter inch Bay with an HD
hdmi pass-through or whatever you can
actually link hdmi cable to the front of
your case and basically plug in an HTC
vive or an arceus oculus rift and just
have a lot better configuration for
setting up your VR display your headset
and whatnot instead of having to ride it
behind your case which can be kind of a
pain in the ass so altogether great
stuff extreme gaming gtx 1080 from
gigabyte by the way guys my copy text
coverage of 2016 is brought to you by
gigabyte g.skill cable maschmann cable
