portable and have the potential to be
powerful workstations unfortunately they
also overheat have limited functionality
compared to full desktop PCs and can
often be overpriced today we examine a
client in search of a better solution
for all of our multitasking needs on
this episode of system config my name is
Jennifer I live here and I need a
high-end gaming PC
I plan to be using the Adobe master
suite as well as some really graphics
intensive games currently I do not have
a desktop PC I have a laptop that I had
to purchase in a rush it's really
underpowered and I've never really been
happy with it I didn't really have a
budget going into this build instead
I've just kind of been collecting parts
over time and I decided to cap it off at
about $1500 the goal that I have in mind
for this new system is to have a really
solid high-end gaming PC that's also a
workstation and is aesthetically
pleasing to have in my room so I turned
to Kyle for his advice and system-config
for the build alright guys so I have
cordially invited Jenny to well our
house because for those of you didn't
know we're actually roommates and
co-workers as well but I also asked her
to keep her laptop at home and not and
not take it out anywhere so that we can
take a look at it so we know kind of
where we're coming from and where we're
going to so this is a Danish laptop it's
actually a very sleek laptop I think
it's about a year or two old the specs
on it it's got a Core i5 processors a
mobile processor of course it's an i5 30
to 30 M and it's got 6 gigs of RAM it's
running 8.1 currently Windows 8.1 why
don't you tell us a little bit about how
you got this laptop and kind of why you
got it well I had to make a really quick
decision about purchasing this laptop my
previous laptop was getting pixel cancer
in the screen it was just spreading and
getting worse and worse and eventually
became unusable terminal uh that
happened while I was in the middle of
researching my master's thesis and so I
literally had to make a snap decision I
had about six hundred dollars to spend
and this was the best laptop I could
afford at the time gotcha so it was kind
of like spur of the moment really
impulsive Biden how much time to
research exactly I knew I wanted
something with an SSD so would have the
quick boot up time which my previous
laptop was really lack
and then I also wanted it to have a lot
of features like USB 3.0 ports I needed
HDMI also it has SD card reader in the
bottom which are all must-haves for me
plus an optical drive because at the
time I didn't have a TV and this was my
entertainment center exactly it was
everything but as time has gone on I'm
becoming less and less happy with it
there's a few things about the form
factor I don't really like particularly
where the touchpad is located in
relation to the spacebar on the keypad
has been very annoying and also it just
can't keep up with the types of things I
want to do now with a computer I think
there have been a couple times when
we've just been sitting here in the
waiting room like I'll be watching TV or
something and all of a sudden in the
corner all I hear you could like ah
what's wrong with this thing just like I
don't look over it it's just you with
the laptop and it's just like oh gosh
she needs a new computer really badly I
think you you were telling me earlier
that you do some photography yeah and
you usually upload the pictures to your
computer and put them online and you
kind of want to do some more editing
with them as well and have that
bandwidth to actually pump out some some
cool pictures right and so I have tried
to run Adobe on this laptop and it just
it was a dog it couldn't handle it and
then also when we did your live stream
it couldn't even run the simplest games
and so I had to run back to work
actually pick up a gaming laptop so that
we could have an extra gaming machine
for that day and that was when it was
really I started planning with you right
building a PC when we couldn't run
hotline Miami we knew something had to
change because we're clearly we're
working with Intel HD graphics so it's
integrated there's nothing fancy about
it so it's a it's very limiting for you
right now so keep it for portability I
mean it's still a good good laptop you
know for everything it is but I think
you need something a little bit more
powerful and I think we have something
in store for you today here on system
config so yet are you ready to take a
look at the hardware that we're gonna be
using for your bill let's look at the
hardware Kyle all right let's do it all
right so at the forefront of this build
we have the core i7 4770k from Intel
choosing this part was a no-brainer
since jenny was able to participate in
Intel's retail edge program which lets
people like Jenny who work in the tech
industry take quizzes about Intel trivia
in order to get killer deals on Intel
products after passing enough quizzes
Intel processors and ultrabooks Jenny
was able to score this flagship Haswell
CPU for just over a hundred bucks which
I'm sure is turning many of you green
with envy right about now speaking of
green the motherboard of choice is the
gigabyte g1 sniper z87 among all the
advantages of the z87 chipset it also
features a creative sound Core 3d quad
core processor and a qualcomm atheros
killer LAN chip set for automatic packet
prioritization while gaming throwing
gigabytes easy to overclocking software
and a striking aesthetic and you've got
a board with enough nifty gaming
features that will make Jenny's
transition into PC gaming an enjoyable
experience for memory we turn to
Kingston for one of their HyperX black
dual channel kits they're reliable
they've got cool low profile heat sinks
what more could you want well I suppose
a lot of things but for Jenny's needs
these should have no problem getting the
job done rated at 1600 megahertz these 2
8 gig modules give us a combined total
of 16 gigs now when Jenny mentioned to
me that she would definitely be doing
some overclocking with this system I
wanted to make sure she had an adequate
cooling solution so here we have
Corsairs h75 liquid cooler successor to
the popular H 60 it features a 120
millimeter radiator at 25 millimeters
thick and comes with a pair of their
awesome SP pwm fans now I usually avoid
anything that stands for malevolent evil
and destruction but the power color
devil r9 270x may be the only exception
this card uses the same chip as its last
gen counterpart the Radeon HD 7870
but sports a slightly higher clock speed
and a much improved memory clock
frequency power colours cooler design on
this card is simply wicked and has been
said to do a nice job at keeping
thermals down which is absolutely
crucial given the chassis we'll be
building it as you'll soon see here we
revisit Kingston with their 120 gig
hyper x3k SSD these days I think it's
safe to say there's little to no excuse
not to have an SSD in your system if you
have a budget close to Jenny's with the
drive of this size she'll be able to
install her OS and frequently used
applications like Chrome and Photoshop
to speed up her day-to-day tasks but
until she upgrades the capacity of her
trusty mand she'll probably have to
store the humble beginnings of her steam
library onto a mechanical drive for this
we've chosen a WD black 2 terabyte hard
drive besides all of her games Jenny
will need ample storage for all over
high-res images from her photo shoot
escapades and since she'll be frequently
transferring data to the drive the
snappy seek times and read/write speeds
at the WD black should be a good fit
powering this system is the eco-friendly
in win greenie series 6 50 watt power
supply now in today's day and age
anything with eco-friendly branding
tends to carry a rather wimpy
connotation thanks Prius but this unit
is just as capable as any in its class
it's got Japanese bolt capacitors 80
plus bronze certification and also came
in a 100% recyclable package which made
for one very happy Jenny okay I'll give
you guys a second to laugh or throw your
hands in the air and yell at the screen
whatever you got to do upon seeing the
case choice for this build but rest
assured when I tell you that I can
explain why we decided to go with a two
hundred and eighty dollar case for a
$1500 rig after seeing the last episode
of system-config anyone wanted to
participate in a future episode
so they set Jenny up with their own
flagship case the 904 originally we had
picked out the BitFenix phenom for this
build but one glance at the exquisite
design of the 904 and Jenny transformed
into Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka and I
can't blame her it does look pretty
incredible but since this was a
last-minute change to our plan we didn't
have a chance to do much research on
this case which might come back to haunt
us during the build I can only hope that
we managed to fit all the components
inside without shattering that beautiful
tempered-glass side panel and that
ladies and gentlemen is the collection
of parts will be using for Jenny system
it's worth noting that she also picked
up the key for Windows 8.1 putting the
total cost for this build just over her
$1,500 budget now throw the retail edge
program and the sponsor 904 in the mix
and we're looking at a 1520 $4 build
that she was able to get for just over a
grand in an admirable attempt to be
economical she decided to put the money
she saved towards a new camera to take
higher quality photos but now that we
have all the parts on the table it's
time to put this robust yet questionably
unbalanced rig together
you
Oh
alright ladies and gentlemen we have
just finished the build in the in win
904 computer chassis and my first
instinct is to say went smoothly but it
clearly did not there were a lot of
issues I think maybe Jenny choosing to
go with the in win 904 at the last
minute the day before the shoot may have
had something to do with some of the
complications we encountered during the
build I don't know what do you think
Jenny I think that it probably would
have been wiser decision to research the
case a little bit more before I made the
snap judgment to bring it home instead
of the BitFenix phenom which I had
originally chosen for the build and that
created problems in that moment one of
which was the radiator which we thought
was gonna go in effortlessly because we
saw that the fan mounting points
actually I just I was watching Dimitri's
video from hardware canucks he did a
beautiful video on this case that was in
the five minutes before we started this
right before we press record I was like
I should probably find out something
about this case because I have no idea
what it's about and so I didn't really
have time to watch the entire video I'm
sorry to mitri it was a great video
though from what I saw so I was kind of
skimming through it I missed the part
where he said it's a 90 millimeter fan
mount on the back of the case so I'm
just assuming well every case these days
has a 120 millimeter nope no it doesn't
so we pulled out the radiator the h75
and I was like we're not gonna be able
to shoot system configure today it's not
gonna fit and then by the grace of God
we found the miracle mounting point at
the bottom of the case that does house a
120 millimeter fan but I don't can
accommodate up to 140 millimeter fan she
did do her research 10 minutes before
the shoot guys that just proves it so
luckily we were able to get the radiator
in there somehow it's pretty miraculous
this does look a little bit awkward but
honestly it's it's pinching just barely
I don't think it's really in keeping any
current so I think the temperature
should be just fine for reference we've
got Sleeping Dogs here we are running a
game and we're getting pretty decent
frames here we're also going to throw
those up and everything's running really
smooth I did want to say one thing about
this build is that is incredibly quiet
you can barely hear it I don't know if
it's picking up on the mics at all
probably not if you do hear it's
probably my system in the background
that you're hearing but really the only
thing that I can
year like the two Corsair fans because
that's those are really the only fans in
there besides the power supply with
power supplies eco-friendly and spins a
really low rpm everything is really
really Talent honestly I think this has
been a really great build for us all and
I think that's going to wrap it up for
this episode of system-config guys so if
you guys are interested in being on the
show send me an email to letters to
awesomesauce at gmail.com and you could
be on the next episode that's just some
config thank you all for watching guys
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
