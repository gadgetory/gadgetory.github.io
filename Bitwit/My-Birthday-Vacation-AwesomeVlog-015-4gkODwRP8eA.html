alright we made it through security
alright so I'm feeling pretty good
besides a little a little bit sore
certain area runtime from Southern
California to Oahu is about five and a
half hours or so so probably gonna watch
movie or two maybe catch some Z's
because it is still fairly early I
didn't get much sleep earlier so should
be there soon
oh and by the way filming with the rx100
m3 it came in the mail yesterday so I'm
really excited to be vlogging with the
humble trip is look good better look at
let's take on here flames on the moon
not quite off the ground yet it was
terrifying
- terrified
officers like Nick really shaken bring
down a little bit
Heather on the other hand
that's the steadiest I've seen your
hands in the last 10 minutes
all right we're here just got off the
plane go into baggage claim
still at the airport obviously and we
got we got palm trees leave all them
palm trees actually that's not very
special because they have a lot of those
in Southern California too
our numbers have multiplied we just met
up with Rachael and Ian her boyfriend
they they were on a different plane and
so uh they are a little bit earlier
child
oh you Wow you were one of the lucky
ones it's okay I'm here now okay all
right
Ian's got money let's go no all right
guys we've stumbled into Costco just to
grab a few things like beer and stuff to
make pina coladas and whatnot and so far
everything looks pretty much the same as
any other Costco you'd find in
California except yeah but here this is
our hotel this is the Moana Surfrider is
a Westin Hotel one and we're we are
about to do some illegal stuff right go
on the wrong way not a good not a good
grand entrance Mike let's try that again
we're inside the hotel Mike's up the
concierge counter right now getting our
hotel keys our room keys it's a pretty
swanky joint I must say
I definitely can't afford a place like
this Mike's actually using some of his
American Express points to get our hotel
rooms for free so huge props to him for
making this all possible really cool you
got a nice little belt you know here
where people are just chillin watching
all the other plebs walk by it's pretty
sweet stuff we actually have two rooms
so it's gonna be me me Heather Ian and
Rachael in one room and Mike and Erin
are sharing a queen-size bed in the
other room so it's gonna be a pretty
cozy time here holy moly you were
kidding this view is incredible Wow are
you holding the bars like you're in jail
we're in paradise look get that crystal
clear blue water seagulls in the air uh
this is this is the life where's my
booze
and now we're headed to dinner we're
gonna walk just down the street to a
nice little place don't don't throw up
signs like that I don't know what gang
sign that was Aaron but it's not cool
all right
hey come on I'm gonna have to edit this
out guys no you're not cool not adding
any of that out you're right I'm not
stop it stop let me on the camera all
right we just had a lovely dinner at the
Tiki place and we're all full now and
now we're on the beach and someone's
yelling at me Heather and Rachel are
screaming in the water I hope they don't
get pulled under by a shark and there's
a creepy old dude just walking walking
here with us but other than that things
are pretty nice the nightlife is
happening here in Oahu Hotel looks
beautiful all lit up at night and the
water is surprisingly warm I mean maybe
it's not surprisingly warm I'm just from
Southern California where the water is
always freezing cold and I never want to
go in it but this is actually like
heated pool warm Ian you're gonna cause
a seizure it looks like you're signaling
for help should we be signaling for help
oh god water
the nearby beach tomorrow and do some
snorkeling and look at all the cool sea
creatures down below so we've come
across the snorkel bobs
so we're going to go inside and see what
they have
this is a little hike that we're gonna
do it's a one-mile hike but it's pretty
straight vertical so I don't know
exactly how exhausting its going to be
there was this nice little sign degree
us that says warning tram line is steep
and not maintained and a bunch of other
stuff about how the tram line can be
exhausting and physically challenging
but you know I did hi-lander so screw it
I'm gonna be just fine
if you hear all that popping noise in
the background those are gunshots
there's a shooting range just over this
little hill there so one of us might get
nicked while we're hiking up this trail
but that'll be that'll be that'll be
great for the vlog I think um this guy's
just running for his life as you can see
it's just one straight line up the
mountain and just goes for about a mile
it's very steep now we can do it
I believe I believe in all of you Oh
supper
don't believe in your errand so as you
guys can see I am walking straight over
some train tracks now I don't worry too
much this these are abandoned train
tracks but this used to be a railroad
that went all the way up and all the way
down this mountain and then they retired
it years and years ago
and now it's just a hiking trail going
up this mountain would have been much
easier on a train alright we made it to
the top it only took about 45 minutes
maybe not bad there's about a thousand
steps on the entire trail so effective
that and I'm not sure what our elevation
level is right now a little over a
thousand feet that that little Bay right
there is haunama bay we just came from
there that's we were snorkeling just a
couple hours ago but there's a pretty
sweet view actually
all right we're on an ATV tour now and
we just made a pit stop they taught us
how to pick and crack open macadamia
nuts
so you basically take a rock and smash
it just with enough pressure so that it
cracks the outside shell that doesn't
smash the actual nut inside into a
million pieces
and Aaron did a beautiful job very nice
sharing that is perfect and now you can
eat it eat it now Aaron is the official
Nutcracker on this trip Aaron being an
artist in his natural habitat capturing
Beauty all around work Kona Brewing
Company they we have we have this in
America too or well this is America
hello we have this in the continental US
as well been doing that a lot lately but
this is the actual prairie so we're
gonna see if they have some extra beer
that we haven't seen before and maybe
it'll even taste better inside the
restaurant it's outside the restroom
pretty sweet all right guys so we just
wrapped up dinner at the Kona Brewing
Company we have a lovely lovely meal and
we made a pit stop on the way back to
the hotel at a little private beach that
was kind of isolated and there were too
many people around we wanted to watch
the sunset so we pulled over got out of
the car and I actually happened to ask
Heather a question whoa nice boys will
you marry me yes that's right
so I popped the question
we've been even together for four years
now and I just felt like the timing was
right
so I manned up and did it I guess not
what no do we how does this work
I've never done this before so we'll
figure it out we're gonna make it up as
we go but I thought I would include
include this little announcement in the
vlog
just because I like to keep you guys in
the loop but yeah we're married for no
thank you
guess what guys we're engaged we're in a
word in karaoke less
Ian's really enjoying the music it's the
airplane
Racing music while we're drinking this
is a bad idea
DJ Hedrick Wow Oh
Ian has a radio voice oh yeah he's got a
face for radio
Oh
and I'm feeling good
these bitches late-night McDonald's Ron

to change our mine we're crossing the
street and we're gonna kill ourselves
but were jaywalking in any way hey how's
it going Jim this time I'm an Asian
really she's really full I had nearly
ten pieces that you can McNugget and fry
there's a lot for a girl of your size my
fans need to have more fun than sitting
around watching your videos what what do
you would you film half of these videos
this reflects poorly on yourself no man

this is nah I'm gonna make an interior
blog I hope we're at a place called mark
um a dude on right now it's a really
well-known famous scoot on place in Oahu
it's cafeteria-style so you just kind of
go down an assembly line pick up all the
things you want and they also hand make
all of their goo gone fresh right here
every day every morning I'm getting the
Mikuru done which is gonna be problem
comes with some seasoned beef in the hot
broth there it is oh my god oh my god oh
my god again other options they have
here the sorry udon caca who Don bukkake
udon this is the byodo-in temple
it's a Japanese temple and it's actually
on a cemetery ground um so there's a lot
of dead bodies around here which is kind
of scary I hope I hope this place isn't
haunted
and here we've stumbled across an old
ancient doorbell
I got the last video of this blog
because we are on the plane headed home
back to LA I'm going to be flying into
LAX at 5 in the morning I believe so
