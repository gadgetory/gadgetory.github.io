wrote a very important letter to a very
important recipient it went something
like this
dear Santa for Christmas this year I
could ask you for superficial gifts like
better camera equipment a new computer
or my own apartment but then I
remembered what happened to Austin Evans
and how all those things could vanish in
the blink of a freak fire accident so in
a brief moment of clarity I made some
revisions to my wishlist instead all I
want this year is a brand new open-air
chassis with it I'll build an awesome
testbed for benchmarking computer parts
so I can share my findings with the
world I really don't mind which case it
is just as long as it's not made out of
acrylic that sucks your friend
always Kyle much to my delight
the old man fulfilled my request in the
form of a Lian Li PCT 60 aluminum
construction full-size hardware supports
a carrying handle it was the best
Christmas gift I received in years since
acquiring the PCT 60 I've been hard at
work gathering the rest of the
components necessary for a test bed
capable of benchmarking today's current
graphics cards SSDs CPU coolers and
pretty much all else in the PC Kingdom
that can be benchmarked since this is
arguably no easy task I'm excited to
announce that I finally have everything
I need to put it all together but before
we do a little time-lapse build and show
off the finish setup let's quickly go
over the individual components that will
create this epic testing machine now
I've already spoken a bit about this
case but it still deserves some sexy
b-roll shots just like the rest all
jokes aside the PCT 60 from Leanne Lee
remains one of my favorite test benches
on the market for its tenacious aluminum
construction and that ever so useful
carrying handle since I'll definitely be
toting it around from time to time for
processing I've chosen the Intel Core i7
59 30k it has 6 cores with
hyper-threading overclocks like a champ
and won't experience any bottlenecking
with most hardware configurations I
throw at it
not to mention it also lives on the x99
platform which opens up windows for the
latest influx of technologies like ddr4
now to facilitate the capabilities of
such a CPU I needed a motherboard of
equal caliber so here we have the x99 UD
5 Wi-Fi from gigabyte 4 way graphic
support dual by
Sandeul m2 are just some of the bells
and whistles I'll be using with the
finished build and on a side note let me
know in the comments if you'd like me to
review this board at some point after
I've been using it for a while my memory
solution is a 4 by 4 16 gigabyte kits of
HyperX predator ddr4 at 2400 megahertz
it's efficient it's fast and gosh darn
it those are some pretty vicious heat
spreaders enough said for the task of
cooling my 59 30 K I've elected the
Kelvin t12 from our friends at fractal
design I knew that I wanted a liquid
cooling solution in order to hit some
decent overclocks on the 59 30 K but I
figured a 240 millimeter radiator would
be a bit bulky for the PCT 60 so I
imagine this single 120 unit will work
out nicely now I'm fairly certain that
out of all the various components I'll
be testing with this system I'll likely
be benchmarking video cards the most but
since haswell-e doesn't support an i GPU
i'll need a daily driver on days i'm not
testing video cards so for now we'll be
using this EVGA GTX 970 for the win
edition with its super-fast factory
overclock and 4 gig three-and-a-half
gigabyte frame buffer my operating
system will live on this Corsair force
series LX SSD for now it's not the
snappiest drive by any means and write
speeds do leave something to be desired
but it is still SATA rev3 and should do
just fine until I find a better
alternative 128 gigabytes should be
plenty of space for the operating system
and all of my benchmarking tools but for
video games and other large programs
I'll be using this 1 terabyte Seagate
Barracuda fun fact this is the actual
drive I used in my first ever PC build
back in 2011 it's managed to hold out
for this long so let's hope it still got
some juice left now powering this entire
test bed is a tall order considering the
potential for 4-way GPU testing but I am
fairly confident that the power delivery
of this G 1600 watt power supply from
Leppa
will suffice 80 plus gold certification
and what seems to be 80 plus pounds this
fully modular monster of a PSU will
hopefully see me through even the most
power hungry of hardware setups
rounding out the parts list I'll also be
using an asus om optical drive to well I
probably won't be using it much but I
was think of watching it collect dust in
my closet so now I get to watch it
collect dust in the PC 216 and finally
ending on a software note my operating
system of choice is Windows 8.1 64-bit
with future plans to update
Windows 10 when it becomes available
later this year assuming it's not
absolutely terrible
so those are all the parts of my test
bed and I gotta admit I'm pretty happy
with what I have so far
save for the SSD which I might swap out
later down the line of course as
promising as all of this seems I won't
fully know how well the system performs
until I build it so I'm gonna do that
now
and the build is complete pretty
straightforward and I'm happy to report
that it is booting up properly logically
the next step here is to get Windows
installed with all the necessary drivers
and programs at which point I can then
proceed to giving that 59:30 Kay a nice
little overclock but moving even beyond
the realm of this system if my plan with
this build is to conduct relevant
benchmarks of high end video cards and
even multi-gpu setups in the future I'm
going to need something with a few more
pixels than a simple 1080 display
I need like four of those or or maybe
just a single 4k monitor yeah that
sounds good so that's my next step with
getting this testbed all set up and
ideally it'd be great if I could get my
hands on the 4k monitor to review that
way I wouldn't have to pay for one but
in the event I can't secure one soon I
may just have to buy my own like some
kind of a normal person to 4k panels
I've had my eye on lately are the Acer B
three to six H K and the Ben q BL three
to zero one pH both of which meet my
criteria for being over 28 inch IPS
displays in the sub $1,000 price range
now needless to say I'm having a rough
time deciding between the two so in the
comments let me know which one you think
I'd be better off with or if there's
another 4k IPS you recommend of similar
price and spec but I have gotten
drastically off-topic here so before I
close out I wanted to give a quick
shout-out to my sponsor for today's
video
lynda.com now you guys know I love
YouTube right I mean come on and while
you can find a tutorial on pretty much
anything here the videos you often find
aren't exactly hardware canucks quality
I mean just the other day Paul was
trying to follow a streaming tutorial on
YouTube and I overheard him use several
choice words I'd rather not repeat
lynda.com however offers a sware free
learning experience with HD online
courses led by industry professionals so
you can learn things like how to blow up
your cat's in After Effects oh God big
distinction there at any rate it is
completely free to try so I'm gonna put
a link in the description below for
those of you who like tutorial videos
without someone's dog barking in the
background but that's gonna do it for
now guys as always toss me a like on
this video before you go if you enjoyed
it and let me know what you think of my
new test bed then I choose the right
parts or if not what would you have done
differently lastly if you like what</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
