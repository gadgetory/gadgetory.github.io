channel today is going to be a build
vlog of sorts where I'm essentially
going to be upgrading my HTTP see here
those of you who aren't familiar HCPCS
that stands for home Peter PC and that's
what I pretty much been using this for
for the last few years now actually
we're on a z77 platform with a core i5
3570 k which is not overclocked what a
shame even though the cooler that i have
in there a Samuel 17 from prolimatech
isn't the best overclocking cooler that
you could probably use I probably should
dial in a small OC at some point in this
video so we'll get around to that it's
also got a gtx 750ti black edition from
gigabyte very nice budget and factory
overclocked card that's been excellent
for our 1080 needs well connected to my
55 inch screen over there but there are
certain things about this HTTP see that
I've been wanting to change or upgrade
or modify for awhile the first of which
is throwing in another stick of RAM now
actually this was built with two
initially built back in 2012 or whatever
with full eight gigs of RAM it had two
four gig sticks now one of those sticks
had to be taken out in an emergency
situation where one of the sticks was
used to save another pcs life is a very
dramatic genetic day but finally this is
going back in so we can actually do some
triple-a high-end gaming on this thing
now that being said we aren't going to
be able to do some high-end gaming with
a 750 Ti in here well it is a great
budget card we need a little bit more
power if we're going to be gaming at a
decent decent smooth high quality
settings so I've got an r9 285 here Mini
ITX version from sapphire excellent
little card I did a review on this the
ITX compact I should say it's actually
smaller or shorter than the 750 Ti but
it's more powerful absolutely more
powerful it's got a single PCIe 8 pin
PCIe but it doesn't necessarily need two
more power-efficient especially compared
to the Maxwell architecture that the 750
Ti is rocking it's it's it's kind of a
power hog in comparison but the fact
that there's only a single pin single 8
pin PCIe connector means will minimize
some of the cable clutter the last thing
I want to upgrade is the storage
configuration here now so far
ever since I built it it's had a single
256 gig Plextor m5 pro SSD in there
which has been fine for my wife and i's
needs because we have an ass and we we
stream a lot of our content and media
from Netflix and things like that but if
we're going to be doing some triple-a
titles triple-a gaming I should say
we're going to need some more storage in
here now granted I could throw in
something like another SSD or even a
three and a half inch mechanical drive
because there is room in here believe it
or not but it's already so packed and
the cables are already just kind of
chaotic that I'm actually going to go a
different route and that is mSATA
there's actually an M SATA slot beneath
the motherboard that does z77 e ITX from
asrock excellent little board for the
price at least it was back in the day I
didn't even realize when I bought the
board years ago that it had an M SATA
slot underneath it so I just ordered
some no-name brand from Taiwan or China
whatever hopefully doesn't die on me in
the first week but it's on its way right
now to my place it's in shipping so once
I once I get that I'll be able to take
this this guy apart clean everything out
and install that M SATA Drive in there
and start loading up some games then we
can do some testing and actually a game
on this thing with with some heavy
hitting games that aren't just you know
Sonic all-stars racing transformed or
something like that so I've rambled on
long enough why don't we go ahead and
start breaking this guy down clean this
 up
and we'll take it from there boom all
right and we're underway the
deconstruction process has begun let's
go ahead and start off with the undoing
the OD e the stupid thing about this
optical drive is that I haven't really
been able to use it all that much
because I haven't found a good blu-ray
playback software on Windows 8.1
hopefully you guys can maybe give me
some suggestions if not I hate all of
you so that came off pretty easy here's
the optical drive and then we've got the
SSD right beneath it very nasty I would
have been it would have been tight to
fit another one of those things in here
especially a three and a half inch I
believe the three and a half inch would
have had to go in place in lieu of the
optical drive so I would have had to
take this out completely in order to get
a mechanical in there so good thing
we're going with the mSATA which is
still on its way by the way and I
figured out it's a
5:50 and crucial it's not I was looking
at some no-name Taiwanese brands or
whatever but I ended up going with a
crucial crucial awesome
looks like there's their latch that I
need to press or can I just pull this up
yeah how the motherboard works up yep
this is nasty ooh whoo it is just and
their last and final screw it's the same
okay it's Paris boy it's just the Paris
blackout calm down remove the
motherboard now see this is where the
super long thermal right screwdriver
comes in handy you know I like it long
it's super magnetic too
it's super effective against groove now
watch us take this motherboard out flip
it around and find out there's no m SATA
port on the bottom there is oh thank god
oh thank god it's right there I know you
guys can't see right now
but it's right there can confirm I
probably shouldn't hold it from the CPU
cooler let's go ahead and grab the
motherboard instead get this 8-pin
connector out yes
Thank You EPS thank you and then next
we're going to go ahead and just remove
this CPU cooler here again I think I
mentioned this maybe earlier in the
video but we've got a Samuel 17 CPU
cooler heatsink I should say very nice
low profile heatsink one of the best I
have ever used personally dumb heat
pipes look at that Lee gasps sexy that
it doesn't come with a fan so it gives
you the option to slap whatever a fan
that you'd like on there 120ml I've got
a silent 12 pwm gelid is a gallon or
gelid I don't know there should be a
swordfight on awesome hardware but I've
got a 120 millimeter fan on here that
stays really quiet but does move a lot
of air it's kind of a nice balance
between airflow and static pressure so
we've got our fan off here below you
look at that that is some belt and
master stuff let me go ahead and focus
on this oh I love this camera app thank
you Paul for introducing me to this
camera app that I can auto focus with
from my phone oh it's amazing it's so
amazing but here he isn't even closer
look just so I can tap to autofocus
again oh it's beautiful
it's so cool but yeah it's nasty right
that is disgusting so we're going to go
ahead and clean that kept autofocus boom
and that is the last of them
go ahead and take it out BAM good use
some fresh coat of thermal paste why not
but there you go there's a full look at
the board as well as the cooler alright
it's dust off time I'm definitely not
going to do it in here because there's
just way too much crap here so
compressed air will be our back okie
dokie let's go ahead and wipe this then
we'll paste off here gonna get a fresh
coffee filter but I also like to use
these Arctic clean thermal thermal
removers thermal paste removers and
purifiers these are excellent I'll put
links to this India links to these in
the description below if you guys are
interested there's one that's removing
the actual thermal paste and there's one
that purifies the surface and preps it
for for for another application of
thermal grease of your choice so why
don't we go ahead and just I like to
give it one swipe just one dry swipe
like that first apply maybe like a dot
or two you really don't need much of
this stuff comes right off and then just
go ahead and circle circle around boom
like that so that is clean that's clean
right there right but but it's not pure
 is not here you know why because we
haven't used the purifier yet guys come
on
this is grade school elementary stuff
here so go ahead and apply about the
same amount a little second little
circles little circles and boom that is
peers as some pure ass right there
same thing same thing with the CPU bum
bum bum bam z77 EE ITX what aboard what
aboard this was one of the best mini ITX
boards in its class asus had a really
good one as well probably the only one
that might have topped this one just
because they had pretty much the same
features except I believe the Asus one
had built-in bluetooth this one has
built-in Wi-Fi but no Bluetooth so I've
actually got
a little Bluetooth and USB adapter to
get that kind of connectivity boom
Cpl and styles let's clean the fan
before we reinstall the CPU cooler
don't forget the inner the enter the
inner rim of the fan it's where it also
gets pretty damn dusty is the inner rim
right there so you want to give it a
nice rim job on the inside that's a
happy fan need an itty-bitty me let's go
ahead and mount this puppy or we wish
you the memory first yeah then we go
boom up this guy is not in oh you're in
sir you are definitely in by definition
oh that's firm so here it is the crucial
m5 50 512 gigabytes whoo sweet so we're
going to go ahead and install this now
and that will allow us to continue on
with the rest of this filled here so
then we go and boom look at how nice and
easy that is love it let's go ahead and
put this guy in the case see it's clean
it's all clean and shiny even the fan
even the fan is good as new wipe down
the cables and everything so we are in
good shape
ladies and folks so let's go ahead and
drop this guy in there we go
there we go okay
yeah now we can go ahead and start
plugging in our front
Pernell Turner tersh boom the video god
o dudududu where you at here you go
in we go Geronimo perfect perfect fat
why don't we go ahead and install our
unit of power
in there cables cables cables cams
cables cables cables cables cables
cables and I think that is Italy Jim
holy moly we are they are pretty much
done wow that is cool look at that look
at how much cleaner everything looks
here's a look at the video CAD bogus
video CAD looks bad you out you can see
kind of how open it is on at the front
of the case I mean apart from a few
cables wandering around in there that I
can't really do much about there is some
fresh air flow coming from that intake
right they also um yeah why don't we go
ahead and connect this guy to a TV to a
television system and play some video
games on it and see how this r9 285
works out for us
all right forgot the htpc all set up
connected to my TV now which is what
you're seeing sorry I have to talk kind
of quietly right now guys because my
grandparents just went to bed so I've
got to stay hush-hush on the down-low
but as you can see here I've got fraps
up me at the upper right corner it is
we're running around 50 50 ish 50 to 60
fps right now which is actually pretty
good considering the settings that I
match let me go ahead and show you those
going boom boom all right so of course
we're at 1080p sync is off we are not
using any fxaa but we do have 2x
msaa enabled now we could easily turn
this off and apply that and you'll just
see our FPS our framerate just skyrocket
to about 90 as you run around and start
shooting
engage
and different activities around Los
Santos that will drop into the 80s
sometimes a 70s when you're in really
grassy areas that can drop to the 60s
50s or even below but for the most part
it's super smooth hovering around 80 on
average which is really nice to see much
higher than my 750ti was able to achieve
so happy to see that let's go back into
the graphics here to give you guys a
fuller look at the other settings now I
turned population variety all the way
down it's not really important to me and
it eats up a lot of VRAM distance
scaling which is important to me I'd
like to turn that up it's not too heavy
on system resources texture quality we
managed to get away with high shader
quality very high so this is kind of a
blend between normal high and very high
it's just kind of all over the place but
there's a lot of different parameters
here in GTA 5 that they really let you
play around with different different
settings and stuff but for the most part
this is a really decent decent these are
decent quality settings I would say it
looks absolutely great on the TV and it
plays really smoothly too so I'm happy
about that if you were wondering about
any overclocks yes I have overclocked
the r9 285 to about a thousand megahertz
pretty much even and then also be 35 70
K has been overclocked just just a
smidge to 4.2 gigahertz because again
with that low profile heatsink we don't
really have too much wiggle room there
in terms of thermal capacity and whatnot
but the other thing that's fairly
obvious but I still want to point out is
that I have GTA 5 installed now because
I actually have the storage capacity to
save that damn game and install it it's
a 60 gig file was never able to really
install it on that SSD before and so far
the crucial m5 50 s been working out in
the very brief time that I've spent with
it but here we are I've already got you
know evolved Metro last light hitman
absolution installed onto the HTTP C
which is something that was never a
possibility in the first place so very
happy about that let me go ahead and
kill these cops and we'll close out this
damn video but that's pretty much it
guys
so hopefully you enjoyed this little
build vlog I guess you would call it
go ahead and leave me your thoughts in
the comments below what you think of my
upgrades I know this isn't like a super
crazy upgrade from a 750ti
it's not a r9 nano by any means but this
is really good enough for my needs but
let me know what you guys think
nonetheless of this video this kind of
style and in my HD please sleep but
thank you so much for watching be sure
to LIKE the video as well if you haven't
already subscribe to the channel and I
will see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
