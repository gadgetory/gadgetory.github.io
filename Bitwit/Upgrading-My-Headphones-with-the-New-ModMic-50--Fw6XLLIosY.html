been alive for a while you know the
world is a messed up place riddled with
war disease famine and here in America
gaming headsets somehow I have found the
solutions to all of these epidemics but
let's tackle the big one first shall we
gaming headsets need to get their
together how is it possible that such an
oversaturated market can have so few
compelling options to their credit more
solid contenders have begun to emerge
but in recent years the popular remedy
for the dearth of options in this market
was to grab a pair of quality headphones
granted that probably cost a lot less
than a gaming headset with the same
sound quality and slap on a mod mic a
modular microphone that could be fixed
to any pair of cants what a lovely idea
from the team at antlion audio it's a
solution that I've been using daily
since 2014 with their 4.0 model clipped
to my beyerdynamic DT 880 pros but that
all changes today with the release of
their latest revision the mod mic 5.0
whoever's in charge of naming these
products you're doing a great job so
after years of extensive listening to
user feedback the new mod mic arrives in
the zip-up hardshell case and carries
over all the familiar features of its
predecessor backed by some nice
additions and improvements the mounting
system still includes two base clasps
with a strong adhesive backing that
fixes to the outer ear cup of your
headphones naturally the flatter the
mounting surface the stronger the bond
though I had no problem hugging the
voluptuous curves of my AKG k7 x-axis by
the power of magnetism the boom mic
snaps firmly onto the clasp with its own
connecting clasp that can be reversed if
you wish to mount the mic on the other
ear cup once attached notches in the
clasp allow you to swing the boom up and
away when not in use and powerful
magnets ensure the mic never gets
derailed in the process to my surprise
the new boom pole is almost as flexible
as cinnamon nice girl but never did find
out what she did for a living there's a
new stiffness here that keeps the boom
frozen in place long after it's been
molded for optimal positioning and
that's pretty cool apart from a foam pop
filter the microphone itself now
features a module for switching between
pickup patterns
omnidirectional which provides a bit
more clarity in controlled environments
and unidirectional to avoid broadcasting
every little detail to the interweb hey
honey did you try the hemorrhoid cream I
bought you I'm streaming this which has
great feedback to cue you in when you
change positions and size and placement
make switching on-the-fly easy for both
left and right side mic orientation now
with the old model I had two major
complaints the first was that obnoxious
never-ending cable I've seen
communication devices with wires that
long before but those were called
telephones fortunately this issue has
been resolved and replaced by a modular
cabling system with detachable 3.5
millimeter cables in one and 2 meter
varieties choose the link that suits
your needs and significantly reduce the
amount of cable clutter they've also
included a modular mute switch that's
entirely optional like the pickup
pattern switch this one is well sized
well placed and features good click eNOS
and tactility another huge factor that
makes this modular system work so well
is that all the 3.5 milimeter
connections have an outstanding bite to
them to keep the device from literally
falling apart during a game now moving
on to the second thing that I learned to
loathe about the old mod mic and this is
one area where headsets get huge points
was that it added a second cable to your
headgear and no matter the preventative
measures put into place you would
inevitably be left with this now antlion
provides two different tools to help
keep your cables in order unless of
course your headphones have a coiled
cable then you're out of luck the
cable clips are exactly what they sound
like and you get ten of them to aid in
cable management while effective it's
not the prettiest solution and that's
where the foreskin comes in wrapping
your cables with this sleeping jacket
helps prevent snags and really cleans up
the overall look of your hack job
headset but it requires some effort to
use due to the wraps incredibly stubborn
form-fitted shape whether you employ
this sleeve or not will largely depend
on how often you need to separate your
mic and headphone completely as I doubt
most will want to go through this
process often you get two meters of this
leaving stuff that can easily be cut
down to size with a pair of scissors
which immediately starts a fraying
frenzy but if you've ever sleeved your
own PC cables you probably already know
to snip off any stragglers before
sealing the weave via some light touches
with a small flame and remember kids
just
apart from some key design revamps the
mic also gets a slight bump in sound
quality but already sounded pretty darn
good with my unidirectional 4.0 unit now
sounds louder and clearer with a touch
more warmth these qualities are even
improved a smidge further with the 5.0
's on the directional setting noise
cancellation with uni is more or less
the same as it was on that note let's
kick it to a sound test with the mod mic
plugged directly into the 3.5 millimeter
jack on my Panasonic Lumix gh4 how's it
going guys this is a test with the
antlion mod mic 4.0 this is the
unidirectional version alright guys this
is test number 2 with the mod mic 5.0
this is the newest version of the
microphone alright I have just switched
over the mod mic 5.0 to the
omnidirectional setting now with the
switch that's on the microphone itself
so maybe now I'll sound a little bit
more clear maybe there's now that test
wasn't completely useless but chances
are you'll be using the mod mic to chat
with friends online not recording audio
to your mirrorless camera or DSLR so
here's what I sound like to someone on
the other side through the discord team
speaking act
check one two this is a test using the
mod mic 4.0 this is the older version of
the mod mic this is the unidirectional
version of that particular microphone
this is a mic test with the mod mic 5.0
we are now using the unidirectional
pickup pattern
hopefully this introduces a little bit
less ambient noise check one two testing
one two three this is a test with the
mod mic 5.0 with the omnidirectional
pickup pattern let me know how I sound
check one two how's it going everyone
the 4.0 sounds especially tinny in this
test with the 5.0 sounding warmer and
clearer
especially with omnidirectional pickup
plugging into the rear i/o of my x99
sabertooth definitely introduced some
emi feedback regardless of microphone or
pickup pattern my friends in discord who
i conducted a blind sound test on said
the 4.0 actually produced slightly less
feedback than the vibe though this may
have been a detail that would have gone
unnoticed had they not been actively
listening for differences in the end
they assured me that for general
teamspeak use both mic sounded perfectly
fine overall routing things out here the
last change that comes with the new mod
mic is pricing at the time of filming
this video the 5.0 retails for 70 bucks
a steep 40 percent hike over the last
model one of the best things about the 4
I know is that it was affordable which
made it an easy buy but this higher
price point creates a new tier for
gamers who can dish out the extra dough
for all the bells and whistles
while I'm definitely not in love with
the MSRP the 5.0 is for the most part
the modular mic we've been waiting for
and certainly the one I'll be using for
my voice chatting needs from here on out
that's gonna do it for now guys let me
know what you think of this thing in the
comments I'm curious to hear y'all
thoughts
y'all's y'all's his thoughts is also
feel free to share with the class what
hardware you currently used for voice
chatting before you guys go you know
what to do does be alike got in the
video if you enjoyed it and also check
out my store which is now stocked full
with new clothes badass mugs and retro
tallboy glasses for your drinking
pleasure as always I'm oh then what
