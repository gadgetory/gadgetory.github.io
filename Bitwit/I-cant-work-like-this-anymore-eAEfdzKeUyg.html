build me a new computer it's not gonna
be for gaming but mostly for editing
workstation stuff to help edit the
videos on the channel this is my current
work desktop inside the frackle design
to find meaning see and up until
recently it's performed pretty well
processor is an AMD risin thread river
1950 X that's a 16 core CPU it's being
cooled by an inter mac slick tech 2 I
think the tr4 model obviously and this
coolers has started to sort of act funny
I'm getting really high temperatures
like up into the 80s and 90s when I'm
rendering it didn't used to do that when
I first installed everything now I could
very well just swap out the cooler and
call it a day and I'm sure everything
would be perfectly fine except the fact
that Premiere Pro crashes almost daily I
just keep thinking back to that hardware
connects video from Dmitry where he was
talking about his sort of instability
issues with Premiere and AMD CPUs and
once he switched over to Intel things
were better so I'm gonna give that a
shot but yeah let me show you guys
exactly the parts that I'll be using for
the new build pretty brief ray pretty a
pretty beefy alright so it's sort of
wall of crap here so we're gonna be
swapping out an AMD resin thread Ripper
for Intel skylake X quarry 979 60 X also
16 cores it's all on the pricey side but
I've already got one lying around so
might as well put it to work that'll be
dropping into an msi meg X $2.99
creation this motherboard is absolutely
nuts it also has a ton of connectivity
quad channel memory support all those
great things you get with the platform
I've got some pretty awesome Ram to go
along with that this is the g.skill
tribe NZ royal this is the silver not
the gold right yeah CB S on the end so
we've got four sticks here running at
3200 speed I would have been nice to
have eight to fully populate that that
would look super sexy but I'm not gonna
complain with 32 gigs that's what we've
got in the current system our graphics
card is the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti from
EVGA this is their for the win three
model and this thing is still it still
holds its own and a 1080i it's still no
slouch here in 2019 despite all of the
neutering GPUs that are popping up in
the RT X cards plus this one just kind
of matches our theme of being like super
silvery I'm actually gonna call this the
crystal RGB build also kind of a
throwback to the Crystal RGB sketch that
I did a while back like some of the
other parts here it wasn't really seeing
much action so I'm gonna be giving it a
new home here powering the system is a
Corsair RM 1000 I 80 plus gold certified
units fully modular thousand watts
because because this thing draws a lot
of power it's not the most power
efficient ship especially if we're gonna
plan to overclock it's so nice to have a
little bit of overhead there cooling our
16 cores is the H 15 i RGB platinum from
corsair pretty sure this is their
flagship AO at the moment it's actually
a 280 millimeter radiator and it comes
included with two of the mlpro RGB fans
so they perform as good as they look we
also have a six six ml 120 pro fans
they've also thrown in so three of them
are gonna go at the bottom of the case
three more at the front kind of side and
then of course we have we have these two
that are gonna be exhausting hot air at
the top so this is the case that we're
actually using the Lian Li P Co 11
dynamic razor Edition so you can see
we've got some Razer branding right
there if my camera will logos and some
nice little details here you got the
green USB 3.0 ports on the front now
storage is pretty important here because
it's an editing system so I've got a
couple different drives for various
tasks we've got a boot drive this is our
WDS n750 through those random reads
three and a half gigs whoo that's the
500 gig model should be more than enough
for our C Drive and frequently used
applications we have 2 4 terabyte WB
blacks that we're gonna be putting in
raid 0
I'm sorry raid 1 for redundancy where
all the backup and stuff is gonna go and
as far as our editing drive is concerned
I'm actually repurposing this Samsung
960 pro 2 terabyte nvme I'm about to
drive so yeah this is where I'm gonna be
capturing most of the fresh raw footage
to and then editing off of this Drive
usually the editing workflow works best
if you spread out your work across
multiple drives if possible so this is
gonna come in handy to say the least and
that's everything from a personal
workstation rig very exciting stuff I
put links to everything in the
description below guys so go ahead and
check those out if you're interested in
any of the products you see here so
let's kick it off to a little time-lapse
and once we're all done we'll have a
working system that hopefully doesn't
crash in Premiere Pro every 20 minutes 3
2 1 go
oh it is complete oh and it looks it
looks even better than I thought it
would so a couple things about this
build
first of all such a dream case to build
in it was just so easy so fluid tons of
room for activities in just a very smart
layout you got a tip your hat to good
older Bauer therefore helping Langley
design this case from the ground up but
overall fantastic chassis of the build
just looks absolutely fantastic and see
those RGB fans just doing their thing
however these six fans the three on the
bottom of the three on the side here are
actually hooked up to the single node
Pro however that should be wired up to
the motherboard via USB 2.0 but I ran at
a USB 2.0 headers because there's only
two headers on the board and one of them
is being occupied by the AIO the other
is being occupied by the case itself I
overlooked the fact that the case
requires a USB 2.0 header to drive and
power up the LEDs that you see here
which looks very nice the under glow
lighting as well so these are not
actually connected to the board and I
can't configure them within the IQ
software and stuff so that's gonna come
at a later time probably not worth a
dedicated video but if you guys want to
follow me on social media either a bit
with Kyle on Twitter or Instagram I'll
probably be posting some updated images
of the system with different color
schemes once everything is all
configured and looking pretty so go
ahead and follow me there but the other
amazing thing about the mlpro fans is
that they're so quiet like there's so
much air pumping through here like I can
feel it all around three six seven eight
eight fans in this build and the side
panels off it is so quiet so that's my
new workstation PC guys let me know what
you think about Crystal RGB in the
comments below give me honest feedback
I'm always cast I hang up thoughts as
always well us a like on the video if
you enjoyed it get subscribe for more
tech stuff coming at you Rilla Rilla
soon and I will see y'all in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
