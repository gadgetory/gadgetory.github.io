I see oh I love it I mean it's pretty
much perfect I just wish it was a little
smaller that was easy
so here ask for my spicy mini oh wow you
did something useful for once nice spell
check it next time - seriously Heather
what kind of request was that you're
gonna ruin it for everyone the customer
is always right
ladies ladies there's no need to fight
oh let your voice be heard by visiting
the fractal design contact page and
making a product suggestion within
reason
while you're at it you can also check
out the new mesh if I see Minnie click
on the link below to learn more
what's going on guys welcome back today
I'm gonna be putting together a very
special and miniature sized gaming PC
surrounding the new AMD Raven Ridge ap
use meaning this system will not feature
a discrete graphics card rather we're
gonna be using the integrated Vega
graphics that come bundled into this
Rison 520 400 G which is of course a
four core eight thread CPU now since
we're not putting a discrete graphics
card into this system we actually get to
use a pretty tiny case this is the in
win show pen
I'm guessing named that for the famous
composer but look at that it's very nice
actually it's got some heft to it for
its size that's because there's a
built-in or an included 150 watt power
supply which would be plenty for our
needs very nice brushed aluminum finish
on the top and front we have a mesh side
panel and mesh on the top for plenty of
ventilation now one concern here that
Steve from hardware and box 2 also did a
build in this very case with the Raven
Ridge apu recently ran into was that
there was very
little clearance for a CPU cooler so he
ended up having to use a really slim it
was either a cryo rig one of the cryo
rig c7s or one of the really tiny Noctua
fans I can't member which one but it
didn't really fit the bill and he was
running into some pretty warm thermals
and that probably led to suffer
performance guys you should check that
video out also if you have it yet I'll
put a link in the description so
learning from Steve's experience what
I'm gonna do today is attempt to mod
this case by actually Dremel
a section of the mesh panel here so that
we can fit and in the included Wraith
spire cooler that comes with our 2400 G
fantastic CPU it is the hottest apu on
the market right now in terms of
performance and we're gonna be pairing
that with an a/b 350 end gaming Wi-Fi
motherboard from gigabyte additionally
we'll have 16 gigs of g.skill ripjaws 5
ddr4 3200 to go along with it and
finally a 512 gigabyte 960 pro m2 nvme
SSD from good old Samsung so that's what
we're working with today guys should be
a lot of fun let's go ahead and start
off the Dremel Inc part I want to get
the hard modding stuff out of the way
first it should be really embarrassing
for me and fun for you guys to laugh at
me so let's do that and then we'll carry
on with the rest of the build
all right here it is
there's my dremel work this is the first
time again that I've really used a
dremel extensively so obviously it's not
my finest work but it's it's it's kind
of a circle right let's just hope it
fits now the circle that I cut had to be
quite a bit larger than the cooler the
fan itself just because of how this side
panel fits on you actually have to start
from the left first and then slide it
over to the right
but hey would you look at that not too
shabby
the motherboards not actually mounted to
the case yet so it might be a little
sloppy but I think we're good to move on
here so on that note ladies and
gentlemen let's go ahead and finish off
what's left of this build before closing
things out
