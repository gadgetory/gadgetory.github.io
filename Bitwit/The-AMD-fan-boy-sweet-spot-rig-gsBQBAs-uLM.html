trick one of the all AMD build all AMD
built
that's because AMD sponsored this video
so did MSI so there's some MSI parts we
I'm gonna shoot the whole video like
this it's that cool does it bother you
guys it's fine with me it's it hot in
here cuz it kind of feels like it's 360
degrees alright hey how's it going
everyone all a be built because it's
sponsored by AMD this video is sponsored
by AMD and MSI and it's semi mid-range
it's eight hundred and forty-one dollars
with all the parts here primary
objective here is gaming as it usually
is now let me quickly go down the parts
here we've got a rise in 520 600 I did
it to do hold on
I think I'll forgot to mention that he's
actually giving this PC away way to drop
the ball Kyle so stay tuned to the end
of the video where he tells you exactly
how to win it and yes it is
international I knew you were gonna ask
that see I know you so well alright this
is Kyle over and out back to you Kyle
6-quart 12th red CPU and instead of
using the included Wraith cooler I
decided to switch things up go a little
bit fancy and get a hyper 212 black
edition from coolermaster I found this
for 30 bucks so it didn't take a whole
lot out of our budget but it is gonna be
a lot quieter and cooler than the Wraith
cooler I'm saying cooler a lot and
because of that we're gonna have a nicer
and easier time hitting 4 gigahertz on
all cores when we're ready to overclock
our 2600 we've got the MSI B 450
tomahawk this is a lovely board that's
gonna match with our gunmetal gray theme
today look at that look at just look at
this look at those beautiful heat sinks
so so shiny so gray this is a nice sweet
spot board because it's got some bells
and whistles on it but not an overdose
of features that you're probably not
gonna use that'll also drive the price
of the board up I snagged this for 110
bucks which i think is a pretty good
deal considering the quality of the
board along with its various features
and connectivity continuing in no
particular order we have a silicone a 55
SATA rev 3 SSD this is one of the
cheaper stay to rip 3 two and a half
inch drives you can find right now and
even though this is 256 gig you can
actually get the 1 terabyte model for
just over a hundred bucks which i think
is an absolute steal so I'm just gonna
pretend that this is a 1 terabyte drive
and that it's the only drive that we're
putting in the system the drive uses
three NAND I've actually been using one
in a personal system of mine with no
problems and honestly for a mid-range
system like this I think one terabyte is
a good starting off point you can always
add additional
down the line should you need it for
memory we have Patriots VIPRE steel and
this is actually a kid I didn't really
even know about until I started looking
for modules that had gunmetal gray heat
spreaders it's gonna match the build
really nicely it's a 16 gig 2 by 8 gig
kit of ddr4 3200 speed which i think is
a nice sweet spot frequency for rising
as well powering our rig is a see sonic
focus 80 plus gold certified 550 watts
semi modular units and it is super
reliable this thing has great review see
sonic is a super trusted brand I love
their hardware and while you could
easily find a unit that's cheaper than
this one with all the same specs you'd
be hard-pressed to find one that's as
high quality now if you happen to be
building an all AMD system that lands
somewhere in the mid range and the RX
590 is actually a pretty darn good
choice especially if you can find a good
deal on it I think this exact model I
saw in new 8 today the XFX Fatboy rx 590
LAN Newegg for $219 after mail-in rebate
now let's not ignore the fact that
Nvidia recently launched their GTX 1660
for the exact same price the starting
price is also $219 but if you're so
inclined AMD does have a couple tricks
up its sleeve for starters the RX 590
and the 580 for that matter both have 8
gigs of VRAM which is 2 more gigs then
either the GTX 16 60 or the 16 60 TI
there's also a pretty sweet promotion
going on right now where if you buy
select AMD GPUs including the rx 590 you
get three free Triple A games including
the Resident Evil 2 remake Devil May Cry
5 and Tom Clancy's the division 2 it's
basically a hundred eighty bucks worth
of free game so it's really not a bad
deal especially if you're interested in
any of those titles last but not least
we have the case this is the it's not a
new case by any means and I move this
stuff out of the way but it's still a
winner this is the fantex Eclipse P 400
tempered glass in anthracite gray I mean
for like the 70ish dollar price point
you get so many features here and it
actually looks and feels like amazing
quality for the price so altogether I
think it's gonna be a really nice suited
case for this build and that's pretty
much it that's all that's all she wrote
folks so let's just start building stuff
let's just start building oh my god
Jesus this never happened
all right the build is looking awesome
pads on the back to me good job cow but
what's even cooler than a good-looking
PC there's a well performing one so I've
jumped into shadow of the Tomb Raider
you can see here that we're at the 1920
by 1080 we're also running the highest
preset so we're maxing things out let's
just jump in and see how it goes okay
so I should mention that we are
overclocked to four gigahertz on all six
cores we are running an XMP profile so
we're operating at the rated 3200
megahertz and I've even overclocked the
GPU slightly gave it about a 5 percent
boost within global wot man and now
we're running around sixteen hundred and
sixty megahertz
oh look at that view I see him looking
he's looking at the booty he's looking
at the booty control yourself man I
should be talking about the performance
60fps look at that beautiful although it
looks like the game defaults to vsync
when when we have these little
cinematics oh no it does not nevermind
oh oh hey hey cameraman respect respect
the women trying to give me another
strike cuz that's what it feels like all
right can we skip the bullshit oh I
could have skipped that whole thing what
a waste
okay do you want a coke no I do not just
leave me alone
so we run through the village here you
can see we're not getting the greatest
FPS hovering in the 30s and 40s I think
if you know I was actually playing this
regularly with this system I'd probably
turn it down to high settings at least
for this particular title let's actually
see what that does oh she owns high okay
and now we're hovering in the 40s and
50s that's a bit more respectable Oh
still still dip it into the 30s once in
a while there but definitely a bit more
improved and the game still looks great
Oh boom goes the dynamite
that doesn't look good I think someone
farted must have had chili beans for
lunch I'm gonna go investigate still
getting some pretty solid frame rates
here 60 fps and up GPU is now at 71 C so
it's raised up a little bit as it's
gotten more heat soaked but still not
too bad at all looks like we've got some
decent airflow going through the case
our CPU is hovering still in the 50s and
60s so really nothing to be alarmed
about at hyper 212 the lack addition is
doing a fine job keeping all those 4
gigahertz core is cool
I think we have a pretty good idea of
how the system performs in this
particular title let's move on to
another one give me some of that doom up
on her alright so let's take a look at
our video settings really quick note
about your knee okay except ultra preset
Vulcan : t knee right at the chainsaw
I'll take it
look at that 140 fps alright this is
looking smooth as butter oh yeah our
button is a free sync panel things are
looking good feeling good
our fingers are happy eyes are also
happy haha you just got killed by a
mid-range gaming PC alright let's jump
into one more title shall we and then I
can tell you how to win this fantabulous
gaming rig let's try Resident Evil 2
because this is actually one of the
games that comes included if you buy an
RX 590 or rx 580 so might as well see
how it performs with the card that it's
bundled with I don't feel like being
scared right now but I'll do it for you
guys now there's really no graphics
presets here in Resident Evil 2 so I've
kind of just done a blend of high to
very high settings you can kind of just
take a gander as I scroll through the
settings here we can always tweak the
settings if the frame rates looking a
little choppy oh but it is not it is
looking very solid over 100 FPS baby
there baddies here learning baddies oh
Jesus oh god whatever I'm not trying to
play the game we're just showing you
guys performance here so oh my god why
is it so ugly I totally missed oh oh
shit oh shit oh that's a grenade I
wanted to keep that but you know all
things considered alright let's let's
watch them explode yeah that was
satisfying whoo tinker framerate a
little bit there luckily I don't think
there's any more assholes around here
oh my god there's one right now let's go
this way alright nothing really
interesting in here other than those
ball or frame rates woohoo oh shit do
you see that see the damn shadow that is
creepy as hell oh this games so good
it's so good but I hate it so much
alright so we've actually jumped up by
the way I should talk about hardware
stuff 74c on the GPU still nothing to
worry about it is getting a little warm
though looks like we're still hovering
in the 50s and 60s from the cpu looks
like it's pretty much gonna stay there
the majority of titles we are eating
quite a bit of memory here in this game
at around 6 gigabytes oh no it's locked
it's totally locked and there he is ok
I'm gonna blow them up here we go
yeah that wasn't a waste at all Oh way
up three bullets I thought I only have
one okay well I'm gonna end the game
here guys and talk to you about the
