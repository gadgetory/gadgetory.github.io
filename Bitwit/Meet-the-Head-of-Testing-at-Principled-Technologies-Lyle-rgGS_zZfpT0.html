goodnight my name is a liar you'll know
me by now I am a famous you'll know
recently that imperil Commission
principal technology to run the testing
on their 99 country cake most powerful
CPU in the world then principal
technology commissioned me to be the
head of their benchmarking team how
could I say no to such a great
opportunity I never benchmarked befall
so today I show you the genius
interworking of our testing methodology
prepare to be impressed this is one
example of our AMD test bed with a 2700
X from the Rison the EVGA gtx 980ti
now to make the testing process faster
we have a mini AMD test bed and the many
impaired testbed so many tests bed we
run out of wall socket so we plug all
the AMD testbed into an amazon basic
power strip we would have used surge
protector but this one had prime
shipping now you can see we use the AMD
stacker same core that come with the cpu
but a 9900 k no ship with kueh
so we just use a modest aftermarket
solution
you can tell we take our testing very
seriously here at the pp rare we do not
play games okay we test them so now I
show you how he benchmark with the GTA 5
okay first you work at the setting so
many setting here you should know at
least what two or three of them mean or
else you make a bad test okay so I know
the resolution aspect ratio what a vsync
for the vsync do ah it's like an NSYNC
but a Chinese knockoff boy pang must be
the game music so I turn it on I rather
the music record and sing so sexy now we
do a free test okay not a free not a
free test free free test in a row for
maximum accuracy okay which we don't do
a free trust the Intel players are shit
on ok ok so we do a free test test
number one here we go things are going
smooth free so far we have a benchmark
still running system purring like a
tiger but we have a dust buildup on the
CPU cooler no good so I take a can of
compressed air just a little spray just
a little spray
ah fuck use all my compressed air what
are you Jose fuck you house I read your
file this is so bad cuz the dust buildup
could affect the performance about
testing fortunately we have a backup fan
so we turn it on just a little bit ring
around the Rosie there's no work oh we
need to turn it higher must go higher
goodness knew my god the benchmarking so
boring sometime you know you just stare
at the screen forget the number go up
and down that's why I always run the
battlefield in the background when I
testing that way I can just pray for a
few minutes and then go back resume
testing afterward such a good idea
die motherfucker go back to your home
right now as you can see we on the
second benchmark run now things are
going good but the GPU coil one for this
car so bad put my ear so for the third
benchmark run we use a different GPU I
have a different 1080p eye right here
same card 1080p I can ADT oh that's a
ten eighty that's a it's okay you know
the tea I spend for tiny different
it don't matter is fine no problem no
proper now we have the GTA 1080 install
and we are on our third and final
benchmark run so exciting we almost done
by the way I couldn't have these think
off for this run because I could not
hear the music
it's a stupid setting you know rock
arena should have no impact on our data
here we see our three benchmark run
score run number one 60fps run number
261 run number free 81 now here the PT
red we take the median as the final
score middle number 61 frame per second
okay now so many people say the average
much better than the median but who
wants to be average and how can the
average be better than the median you
cannot be better an average at the same
time so we take 61 final score for the
2700 Act that's a score I stand behind
comforting read so now you know how we
row at the principal technology very
fancy you know thank you to Intel for
this job and my new car thank you to you
for watching this video if you write me
you want to make riff to me Tufts are
right on this video right now if you
don't I put a moldy wonton in your shoe
and when you put the shoe on you spirit
a Chinese yeah peace and happiness to
our view bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
