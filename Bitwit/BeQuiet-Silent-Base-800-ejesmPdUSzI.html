channel today I'm taking a look at the
silent base 800 this is actually the
first case from our friends would be
quiet and as the name implies the
chassis is designed for silent operation
a refreshing change from all those cases
designed to be loud the mid tower
measures 495 millimeters deep by 266
wide by 559 tall and comes in black
though you do have the option of orange
black or silver accents along the front
side panel as well as some rubber parts
inside the front exterior is made of
plastic with a sexy brushed grain finish
that seems to be much less prone to
fingerprints than aluminum which is part
of the reason why you can't tell what I
was doing with it earlier three five and
a quarter inch Bay's hide behind a
swinging magnetic door with hinges that
can be mounted on either side of the
case depending on your preference here
we also see the door is lined with thick
dense sound dampening material for
effective noise reduction pushing in the
lower panel allows it to fold down like
the bridge to a Magic Castle revealing
more sound dampening material a
removable dust filter for easy cleaning
and to of be quiets out standing silent
wings to fans with rubber o-rings to
reduce noise and vibration to keep the
fans from chronic asphyxiation
ventilation holes lined both sides of
the front panel from top to bottom at
the top are 2 USB 2 and 2 USB 3 ports
mic and headphone jacks and a large
power button that requires so little
force to press there should be an option
in Windows for what your computer does
when you sneeze additionally the power
button lights up white when powered on a
feature on calling white power there's
also a hard drive activity light that
functions as a stealthy reset button
also on the top are a few ventilation
slots that are so thin my grandparents
started dropping coins in popping off
the top cover we see duel 120 and 140
mounts with a slotted design so you can
position your radiator further away from
the motherboard for additional radiator
clearance making push-pull
configurations a possible option here
it's also quite apparent that only the
rear fan will have access to fresh air
flow from those ventilation slots up top
leaving the other fan cut off like me at
the bar last week I was pleased to see
large cutouts at the front and back for
routing fan cables behind the
motherboard tray because the only thing
more upsetting than seeing cables
hanging from the rafters of your case is
realizing how upset it makes you both
side panels are identical and feature a
smaller square panel in the center that
has two levels of airflow adjustment if
you wish to mount a 120 millimeter fan
the squares can also be sealed closed
for silent operation or be
move completely for optimal airflow both
side panels include removable dust
filters and are generously inter lined
with more sound insulation in case
you're doubting my confidence in the
acoustic suppression of this case at one
point during my review I misplaced my
pillow and decided to scream into the
silent bass 800 instead on the back you
get a bit more ventilation for your top
fans a 1:20 silent winks to fan 3
grommets for water cooling tubes 7
expansion slots and a pullout dust
filter for your power supply and
optional fan books we'll get a closer
look at inside the two plastic
snowmobile legs are flexible yet sturdy
and have rubber feet on the bottom for
added stability they can also be easily
removed which is especially useful for
putting the case on its side when
building or for that leaning tower of
pisa mod you've been dreaming about
removing the side panel is done in the
traditional sense by removing the two
thumb screws and sliding it off on the
inside there's nothing really new or
innovative about the internal layout but
it's familiar and functional just like
your mom for rubber grommets line the
motherboard tray for tidy cable routing
and you do get a nice cutout too near
the top left corner of the motherboard
for your CPU connector be quiet also
gives us a generous cutout for the CPU
cooler as well as a pre-installed
courtesy stand off for the building
impaired the power supply area has cute
little rubber feet to keep it quiet
right beside those bottom mounts I
mentioned earlier for a 120 or 140
millimeter fan with a 140 installed you
get 170 millimeters of power supply
clearance whereas a 120 fan will get you
185 at the front we see that the five
and a quarter inch bays are toolless and
we do get two removable drive cages for
up to seven drives the smaller guy can
be on the bottom as it usually goes but
even with both cages removed there's
only room for a 120 or 140 millimeter at
the front as the e removable drive dock
blocks any chance of clearance for
larger units you heard me right guys
you've been dock blocked I should also
mention you can fit video cards up to 11
inches long with the top cage installed
rather than having hard drive trays the
case includes shock absorbing rubber
strips and thumb screws that mount to
the sides of your three and a half inch
drives before sliding in and securing
them in place with an easy slide to lock
mechanism unfortunately the slots don't
support two and a half inch drives but
instead there's an upside-down SSD mount
on the top of each drive cage a design
that seems to defy gravity
almost as much as it defies right angle
say the cables not always lost however
as there are two more SSD mounts behind
the motherboard tray which still only
somewhat make up for the seam
limited storage support to install
simply remove the mounting plates using
the single thumb screw screw down your
SSD and reattach the plate even with
both SSDs installed here cable
management in this case shouldn't be
much of an issue as you do get just
under an inch of space between the
motherboard tray and side panel a small
critique here is that the only four
tie-down points run alongside the rubber
grommets and it would have been nice to
see a few more by the SSD mounts to help
break up the cables into groups I don't
know about you but the last time I tried
to bunch all my cables into one bundle
it formed a bulge that made me jealous
from what I can tell you during my brief
time with this case I have to applaud be
quiet outstanding first attempt at
delivering a silent case to market that
brings home nearly all the convenient
features were used to seeing at its
price point of a hundred and forty US
dollars copious amounts of sound
insulation a solid internal layout and
the fact that - used this case for his
recent silent PC build all validated
spots as a worthy contender among the
many other silent cases currently
available for future revisions I'd like
to see more ventilation at the top dual
radiator support at the front a few more
tie down points and a lot more SSD
mounts but that's just my opinion I'm
curious to know what you guys think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
