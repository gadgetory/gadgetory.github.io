first of its kind in EK water blocks
pre-built system what is happening right
now we're actually doing this in
collaboration with the folks over at
micro center as part of their power spec
product family shut up we're like five
seconds in oh my god i'm so popular it's
ruining my videos sorry anyway this is
EK micro centers X 600 series there's
actually three systems available so you
got the X 601 which is the sort of base
entry level which is still packing some
pretty hefty hardware at the X 602 a
little bit higher than that and then you
have the X 603 I believe they sent us
the flagship X 603 so the X 600 series
are gonna be available at all the Micro
Center locations across the u.s. that's
25 different retailers and the whole
goal of these rigs is to bring custom
water-cooled systems into the hands of
end users for a very competitive price I
would say the entry-level X 601 is the
best example if you built the exact same
system but just swapped out all the
custom cooling hardware for an AO the
pricing would be extremely competitive
making it a very difficult offer to pass
up the way they're able to do that is by
using II case fluid gaming technology
which is basically aluminium all the
things aluminum fittings aluminum
radiators water blocks and so forth that
brings the cost significantly down while
still delivering excellent performance
now one of the top features of going the
pre-built route is that you only have to
deal with one company to handle your
warranty as opposed to eight or ten or
even a dozen different companies should
you build the system yourself Micro
Center offers a 48 hour warranty on all
these systems which doesn't sound very
great at first glance but what they mean
by that is should you have any issues
with your rig send it back in to them
they'll send it back to you completely
fixed within a 48-hour window so gets
you back into the game or back to
working whatever you decide to do with
your rig and that's pretty cool I think
we're ready to unbox this sucka this
thing is so massive it looks like
there's I think there's another box in
the box come on oh that's probably not
the best way to cut it directly towards
my face don't don't do what I'm doing
please I don't want your parents to sue
me alright did I mention that the CPU
and the GPU is custom cool it's not just
one of the others so that's also a nice
selling point for the X 601 being partly
more expensive than
Oh packaging stuff ooh I love this stuff
in stuff yeah I probably shouldn't do
that in case I need to send it back oh
yeah I forgot they're using the case
that I just used for a recent build my
workstation build actually the Lian Li P
Co 11 dynamic which was done and
designed in collaboration with devour
world-famous overclocker is a modder as
well I believe so their top-of-the-line
system includes a core i7 9700 K and
asus strix
zi 390 e gaming motherboard an nvidia RT
x 2080 16 gigs of DVR for memory a 500
gig solid state boot drive which jay
said in his video i think he reviewed
the same system actually that is
actually an nvme drive but we can
confirm on that in a moment - and you
can see the rest of the specs there yada
yada yada now if you buy one of these
systems from micro center directly in
their store it'll come prefilled 100%
ready to go plug and play done deal
however since they shipped it to moi I'm
guessing it's empty and we got to fill
it ourselves also because I watched Jays
video and he ruined all the surprises
for me okay first time setup
instructions power supply cables looks
like a fully modular unit - whatever it
is more accessories I'm guessing for the
motherboard
yeah that's your AC power cords and
extra SATA cables in here a little tiny
noisy vrn fan which you should not
install Wi-Fi adapter and a bunch of
other stuff okay yeah it's probably good
they didn't pre-fill this no it's also
kind of neat Oh about this is that if
you wanted more of a DIY experience you
can actually go to micro Center and buy
the case by itself along with the DIY
cooling kit has all the stuff you see
here and put it together yourself that
would also give you the flexibility to
choose any of the core components you
wanted to suit your needs if the preset
configurations they have for you do not
work for some reason and just feel right
click oh yeah that's a heavy system
that's good
it means it's powerful unless it's like
a file server with a bunch of hard
drives then maybe not so much all right
PC oil of a dynamic absolutely gorgeous
case we've got a bunch of peel here
yeah alright let's take the side panel
off which what this case means you first
have to take the top panel off this
slides up like so insta pack let's make
sure it's all intact Hey look at that oh
it looks pretty good they did a pretty
good job I would say and I love this
distribution block at the front this
really sets it apart from even something
that you could do yourself look at that
let me take the nasty plastic off god
it's so good I'm gonna take the back
side panel off as well just to confirm
that there is no SATA SSD we got no SATA
base drives in here at least no two and
a half inch drive so I'm guessing that
the one they popped in and the end to
slot it's gotta be interviewing right
let me get a little legal screwdriver
okay now I get to play a guessing game
is it on the top slot or the bottom slot
cuz it looks like there's two I'm gonna
guess the tour there's one screw oh I
forgot to tell you what power supply
this is oh it is RGB and it's one of
micro centers power spec units looks
like it's 850 watts cool all right
moment of truth it's a yeah look at that
970 Evoque plus 500 gig nvme and not to
drive beautiful okay that's all we
needed to know that con you go only just
the camera laughs for yes second here
all right I just want to take a second
to appreciate the rest of this build all
right before we actually fill it up so
we've got a transparent CPU water block
which looks fantastic I really like that
they went with tread NZ RGB ddr4 modules
they could have cheaped out but they
went pretty premium there I'm sure those
have some decent Sampson B dies on them
as well the cable signal looks great
it's black and white very color neutral
which I'm sure they did intentionally
because I believe there is RGB elements
in this system apart from the RAM it's
also PT sleeving as opposed to paracord
so it keeps its shape very well very
high quality stuff there you have two
more mounts for SSDs at the bottom
there's also two three and a half inch
or two and a half inch drive trays at
the back of the case by the power supply
the GPU block is nice and sleek it's got
what looks to be RGB lighting on the
side here which will confirm in a moment
and we've got three 120 millimeter ek
barter fans that are
- the only radiator in the system
injecting hot air out the top of the
case they're also the only fans in the
system and my first reaction whenever I
see a high end system with both the CPU
and the GPU blocked up with only a
single radiator is oh no it's not enough
it's gonna get too hot and overheat and
blah blah blah
but I have a feeling ek knows what
they're doing they've been in the game a
while and from the looks of it it looks
like they've already done some
pre-testing because I do see a bit of
moisture in these tubes but yeah
temperatures are something that will
validate in just a sec so why don't we
go ahead and fill this guy up and I miss
anything
I think well let's fill it let's fill it
up fill it alright so first things first
we got to remove our front panel on the
PCO 11 dynamic which slides up just like
that and bear in mind you have to have
the top panel remove first in order to
remove any of the other panels on this
case the fill port is going to be right
here at the top of our distribution
block and there's a dream port as well
at the very bottom so we want to make
sure that that's tightened and I
actually went around and made sure all
of the fittings in the entire system
were solid and tight not that I don't
trust DK or anything but just want to
make sure that none of them accidentally
got loose and shipping or something like
that I'm gonna take out this fill port
cap which you only the coin or something
similar all right so to fill the loop
I'm using some distilled water inside of
this fill bottle that ek sent over a
couple weeks back actually for hotline
two just did not come included with the
system bear that in mind
I would recommend something like this
with a really thin nozzle if you're
gonna be filling one of these X 600
systems mainly because there's nowhere
for air to escape as you're filling up
the loop so the nice thing about this is
since the nozzle is really thin it
sticks in the fill port right there but
it doesn't completely clog it so that
air is able to actually escape while
you're filling the loop the problem Jay
was having when he initially tried to
fill his with an actual fitting and a
funnel with soft tubing attached to it
was that error had nowhere to go and so
the water was getting backed up and I
wasn't really feeling properly so I'm
just gonna poke this in here we're just
gonna go ahead and start filling her up
you want to make sure that you have no
external power cables plugged in while
you're doing this there's actually the
first system I've worked with that has a
distribution block all the tubes in the
system are actually connected through
the distribution block in some way so
it's kind of like a tubing hub for lack
of a better term and as we fill it up to
the top here I'm gonna go ahead and
remove the bottle now we're pretty much
ready to power the system on so once we
do that the
going to run and it's gonna essentially
distribute the liquid throughout the
loop so this water levels gonna probably
go down pretty quickly and I'm gonna
shut the system off when it's about here
before it reaches the pump so that the
pump doesn't dry run and accidentally
damage itself we're gonna keep doing
that until there's no more air in the
loop and we're left with just fluids so
let's go ahead and do our first boot
cycle here double boot look at our GB so
sexy
all right so we've been trolling around
the city of Los Santos here in GTA 5 for
about 20 minutes now so our CPU and GPU
are pretty much heat soak they're about
as hot as they're gonna get CPU is
running stock so we're at 4600 megahertz
as our turbo frequency that's probably
on one or two cores at the moment but
you can see the temperatures that are
very respectable hovering in the 60s I
haven't really seen it get much hotter
than 70 C which is a really nice spot to
be on our 8 core CPU the GPU however is
running overclocked
I dialed in a 150 megahertz core clock
offset and a 750 mega Hertz memory clock
offset that's taking our core clock to
over 2 gigahertz and yet our GPU staying
pretty darn cool just hit 62 C right
there very happy to see that our single
radiator while it seems maybe a little
underwhelming at first is actually doing
a fine job of keeping everything cool
with those three of our fans our frame
rates aren't too shabby either
considering that we're at 2560 by 1440
with pretty much every setting maxed out
with the exception of MSAA at 2x I
believe so you can see right there as
our rolled through the streets getting
around 120 hundred and 30 FPS depending
on the scene but definitely nothing to
scoff at and note about the Vardar fans
though they're very quiet I can hardly
hear the system running at full load I
think the pump is barely audible but the
fans are just so quiet and the system is
only about a foot and a half away from
me so altogether we're looking at a very
powerful cool and quiet system so there
it is people the EK water blocks and
micro centre power spec x600 family of
pre-built water-cooled systems my guttin
can I just say these things are
beautiful like the distribution block at
the front and just how all the tubes are
so straight and parallel it really it
really arouses me you guys let me know
if you feel the same I mean as far as
custom loop pre-built systems go this
would have to rank towards the top of
the list I would have to imagine as far
as what's on the market currently it's a
really nice system so you guys let me
know do you feel the same way
thoughts and concerns down below as
always toss a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and get subscribed for more
tech stuff coming at you really city
guys thanks again for watching have a
good one and I will see you all in the
neck
I'm powder
