my hands on a custom Polaris 10 card
that I'll be reviewing on the channel
this is the power color our X 480 red
devil which strives to be cooler quieter
and faster than AMD's reference cooler
not to mention it's endorsed by the Dark
Lord Himself Satan may not have the best
track record but he sure makes a great
businessman the card retails for 270 USD
which is fairly reasonable and comes
with two bio settings tailored for
silence or performance with the lighter
pushing the max clocks up to thirteen
hundred and thirty megahertz a 64
megahertz boost over the reference speed
silent mode runs at a lower but
respectable twelve hundred and
seventy-six megahertz but seeing it run
at 666 would have been so metal I should
also mention here that users who snag a
first production of this card should
download the new bios be a power
trawlers devil club which gives you
access to things like software and live
chat support all customers can join the
devil club now for the very low price of
your soul packed with eight gigabytes of
gddr5 the cards memory clock stands at
2000 megahertz giving us eight gigabits
per second of bandwidth on a 256 bit
interface you also get the latest
support for DirectX 12 and opengl 4.5
now the devil series has been a part of
power colors products stack for years
now but it seems as though the company
has grown even bolder with their demonic
branding for the R X 480 launch which
might not bode well with more
conservative folks just make sure you
don't use this card for grandma's next
PC or she'll think it's possessed every
time it starts installing windows
updates taking a closer look at the card
itself its notably bigger than the
reference design in every way
measuring 310 millimeters long 128
millimeters tall and 38 millimeters
thick as we see here the cards cooler
extends well beyond the custom PCB with
a full metal semi open shroud that
exhausts hotness inside your chassis a
first-date faux pas that I learned about
the hard way the shroud sports a rather
devilish red and black theme while
featuring a sturdiness and heft that
feels really good for a card at this
price point clearly hell shouldn't be
underestimated as a global manufacturer
but despite being a torturous and
scorching hot wasteland plagued with
misery China still remains the largest
manufacturing region in 2016
across the shroud we see a trio of 80
millimeter dual ball bearing fans with
an interesting hollow blade design to
improve air flow the fans only spin up
when GPU temps rise above 60 degrees
Celsius and air is pushed downward onto
a large aluminum
stack including a pair of six millimeter
and eight millimeter copper heat pipes
power color has beefed up the rx 480 to
a six plus one phase power design with
increased power to 25 watts compared to
the reference 20 2.5 watts and this
allegedly leads to higher overclocks and
stability but we'll put that to the test
in a bit the board has also been
upgraded to a single aid pin PCIe
connector located on the side of the
card for increased throughput adjacent
is a red devil logo that seems to be
oriented the wrong way compared to most
other boards I'm not sure if this is a
move in favor of inverted cases like the
Corsair 600 C or if power color just
caught on to the devil's habit of
putting things upside down lining the
PCB we find a gorgeous metal backplate
with some stylish ventilation cutouts
and what was intended to be a pentagram
but apparently there was a big
misunderstanding within powered colors
design team and the review sample I
received came shipped with the Star of
David
instead I can't even begin to imagine
how offensive this is going to be to
Satan worshippers now don't fret I've
been informed that consumer retail units
will ship with the unholy pentagram
designed to honor the nefarious
improperly finally our display i/o
includes three DisplayPort 1.4 for 8k at
60 Hertz with HDR support one HDMI 2.0 B
for 4k of 60 Hertz and a dual link DVI
port that's nor to be found on the
reference design hey how about that
now when tweaking the Red Devil and AMD
watt man the card was only able to hit a
four percent overclock the our X 480
isn't known to be a great overclocker by
any means but a small part of me was
hoping to squeeze a bit more nectar out
of the devil's teat I was happy to see
no thermal throttling at an average
clock speed of thirteen hundred and
thirty-eight megahertz
after twenty minutes of running Unigine
Heaven 4.0 well there's no major signs
of throttling the thermals here are
admitting ly not the best i've seen for
a custom board at its warmest the GPU
hit 81 degrees celsius under load and
hovered around the high 70s for a
majority of the time I mean I know it's
a card from hell and all but damn even
Satan's got to feel that burn the GPU on
this card definitely gets toastier than
I would like to see and users will have
to boost the fan RPMs quite a bit if
they hope to maintain temperatures far
from the reference card of course
cranking up the fan speed means
amplifying the noise they produce but if
this cooler has one redeeming quality
its acoustics
yep this card goes right up there on the
top list of things that don't make noise
right between potatoes and the encore at
a Nickelback concert but most
importantly how does she perform to find
out I fired up the card on my ex 99 test
bag with a 69 50 X at 4300 megahertz
32 gigs of DDR 4 at 3800 and an Asus x99
Strix motherboard all cards were
manually overclocked with the latest
drivers on Windows 10 and since the Red
Devil is one hell of a beast it's only
fitting if we devoured today's
benchmarks to the most vicious and
savage of sounds
so summing up these numbers the Red
Devils stayed neck-and-neck with our
reference our X 480 nearly the whole
time meaning it did get beat out by the
GTX 1060 in most titles fire strike
extreme was the one test where the Red
Devil performs notably slower than its
reference blood line oddly and only in
the division didn't see a decent gain
over it at 1920 by 1080 for 20 bucks
more than the reference model it seems
at least in my testing that what you're
paying for with this card is peace of
mind from having the eight pin power
plug killer looks
assuming you're into Satan and truly
silent operation unfortunately I didn't
see much improvement in terms of
thermals or performance but the
reference are X 480 known for its
amazing price to performance the red
devil would have had to yield some more
frames today in order to keep that
reputation and since it doesn't the
premium price tag attached to it makes
the prospect of a competitively priced
gtx 1060 that much more appealing but
let me know what you guys think of this
thing in the comments below and don't
forget to toss me a look on this video
with you enjoyed it's gonna spin my
chair every time I do the outro now
before you go check the description for
links to awesomesauce shirts which can
also double as pants they're not
designed that way but don't let that
stop you also my Amazon affiliate link
yeah for now Kyle with awesome sales
network thank you guys for watching
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and that we'll see you all in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
