to you by fantex
and cable mock click the links in the
description below for more info
so I actually stopped by the cooler
master suite earlier and they had two
cases in particular that I want to share
with you guys first of which is their H
500 P mesh in white by the name you can
probably tell that they've swapped out
the acrylic front panel for a full mesh
panel which is awesome it's actually
also got a built-in dust filter so the
only problem with that I could see is
that the dust would accumulate on the
outside of your case and so it might
promise you to clean it more often
because it might look nasty but overall
you should be getting nearly unimpeded
airflow with this new design and it's
also gonna feature the same 200
millimeter fans RGB fans at the front
there's a pair of those you can also
support two more at the top of the case
360 red support at the top or the front
and while Coolermaster took a lot of
heat pun intended when they initially
launched the original H 500 P because
that acrylic panel was increasing the
the temperatures quite a bit they didn't
stop there they actually made a couple
of the revisions some nice revisions
that were noted in several users reviews
including mine when this case first came
out for starters the top and front
panels don't pop off super easily
anymore because they've been reinforced
the top panel actually has I believe
it's a thumb screw a single thumb screw
at the back that has to be undone before
that can be removed and then there's
another plastic there's an additional
plastic latch on the front panel that
keeps it from simply popping off with
very little effort which I think are
both huge improvements and I actually
kind of gave it a tug on on either end
and it is much more reinforced than it
was additionally the power supply can
now be mounted from the rear with a
separate bracket with a couple thumb
screws we've seen this in the past but
you know the original H 100 P actually
had to remove the power supply basement
and there was actually cut a divided
into pieces that had to be removed
independently it took way too long and
was way too complicated to install your
power supply that's all been fixed so
fantastic changes great listening to
user feedback coolermaster and and also
great on all the reviewers for pointing
out
flaws or certain shortcomings in order
to really give some constructive
criticism and overall make the better
product in the end for the for the end
user also we've got the same price this
is gonna be the same cost same price
upfront as the H 500 P the original
version at 149 us so that's nice they
didn't try to inflate the prices for a
bunch of features that should have been
there in the first place so that was
good on them for that the H 500 M is the
other case you guys might be interested
in uses a very similar design language
as the H 500 P but it's got two 200
millimeter addressable RGB fans at the
front on top of all that Coolermaster
has been working on their in-house
software to fully integrate with philips
hue and other third-party RGB devices
that are supported the way this works is
that those devices and any other RGB
elements inside of your case can
dynamically sync up with whatever colors
are on your display so if you're you
know desktop wallpaper is black in green
or blue and green say something more
colorful than the RGB the addressable
RGB elements that are connected up will
actually reflect that it's actually
pretty cool the only downfall here is
that when you connect third-party
devices they might not be wired exactly
the same and so there's not a
hundred-percent color match all the time
so that is something to be aware of I
should also mention you get four
tempered glass side panels top front
left and right but the beauty here is
that even though the front panel is
already sort of half mesh and half
tempered glass you can actually swap out
that tempered glass piece with an
included mesh panel so that you can get
100% nearly fully unimpeded air flow at
the front which is which is just awesome
360 rad support once again at the top
and the front just like the original H
500 P we also get front panel USB type-c
one port there for USB 3.0 ports and
your audio jacks now we do get a
windowed power supply shroud that is
illuminated of course you could disable
that LED or just simply not plug it in
but what do you guys think here
coolermaster still filling with the idea
of whether or not to put their logo or
etch their logo into this plate or maybe
have two swappable versions one that's
completely plain I think that they
should also include a plain steel piece
that if you don't want any RGB or any
window whatsoever you just want
clean solid-steel power supply basement
the whole length the whole way through I
think that should be an option as well
but guys leave your feedback in the
comments below maybe somebody from
Coolermaster will read it
199 us for this thing 200 bucks is that
a fair price or not let me know what
kind of pricing you would like to see
for this case what you think it's worth
in the comments below always curious to
hear you guys's feedback on this sort of
thing but that's gonna do it for now for
the cooler master suite at CES 2018 guys
toss me a like on the video if you
enjoyed it and feel free to get
subscribed to the channel for more tech
stuff coming at you really soon and I
will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
