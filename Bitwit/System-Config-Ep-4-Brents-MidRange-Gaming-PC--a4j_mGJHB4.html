description to find out more what's up
guys today I am super excited because
after a year-long hiatus I am finally
rolling out the next episode of my
reality webseries that most of you know
as system-config
now for those of you unfamiliar each
episode of the show follows a different
client in need of a new system whether
it's a soccer mom with an aging laptop
or a gamer who's looking for more frames
per second I assess their specific needs
and budget before assembling the perfect
PC solution that's right for them today
you're about to embark on episode 4
which revolves around a student whose
current gaming rig has the horsepower of
a cashew if by chance you haven't seen
the first three episodes of the series
the really great I put links in the
video description and even one year
later these are still some of the videos
that I am most proud of on the channel
and I know many of you guys feel just as
strongly because I've heard the shrill
cries in the comments anxiously awaiting
the day when the series will be brought
back well everyone today is that day
so without keeping you guys waiting any
longer here's the next installment of
system-config
I'm Brent and I'm here because I need a
new gaming computer I bought my computer
actually I bought it from Newegg it was
like a prepackaged kind of thing pretty
much played Wow or World of Warcraft on
it and that's like about all I did on
that computer I started to play wow on
the computer again so depending on where
I don't like what I was doing in the
game
it would occasionally pause maybe like
hold up for like a half a second to a
second just it was very noticeable and
actually really annoying I want to be
able to play the games that I like which
are League of Legends and World of
Warcraft I also am looking to use it for
video editing because I'm a film major
and I've never actually had my own
editing system in my house before so
that's gonna be a nice change so uh you
know I'm fairly confident based on my
experience I watched a couple of the
episodes of system-config and Kyle seems
like you've got a pretty good grasp on
how to get you what you want for the
price you want so I'm hoping you do that
for me as well all right man so we've
got an old system here and I'm really
excited that you actually have an old
desktop and not a laptop because it's a
lot easier to like kind of crack it open
look inside and we can't exactly see
where we're coming from but this is a
CyberPower peek PC as it says right
there and so this was a pre-built system
as you had mentioned before everything
in here kind of re came built together
as one but there were a couple issues
with it one of which was the power
supply which you said kind of fried and
fizzled out after a couple years of use
as well as I believe there's a video
card that is no longer as well the one
that it originally came with it my
friend I'm pretty sure okay cool so
first off you've got a pretty nice full
gaming case here it was pretty pretty
sweet I'm sure captain in moderately
good shape there are some scuffs and
whatnot but that's probably just some
somewhere in there you got two USB twos
on the bottom there and this I think you
bought this one 2008-2009 okay so we're
looking at but potentially a seven-year
old system six or seven years old so why
don't we take it over here by the way
very limited ventilation on the front
here I'm probably only got one of the
on each side so you do have some
ventilation on the side panel as well
you got a mounting point for an 80
millimeter fan just some extra
ventilation here where your video card
would sit and on the back you take a
look at the rear i/o yeah so definitely
this is a not the stock power supply
this looks much higher quality I can
just already tell from the back you've
got some old-school ps2 ports all USB
2.0 and here we can see a hint at what
kind of video card you have in here it's
definitely a an AMD card it's XFX and
you've got an HDMI port and dual link
DVI and d-sub and stuff nice little red
fan let's crack this thing open and take
a look inside see what we got here
okay definitely I called it on the power
supply it's a corsair GS 600 which is
which is good this is a B+ certified and
I'm sure that the original power supply
that came with this was not 80-plus
certified and that generally generally
speaking when companies like cyber power
or similar companies like that build
these preassembled rigs generally the
way they make their margin or the way
they cut corners is by the power supply
they usually skip out on the power
supply it's usually a really in a
low-end model that's not exactly the
safest or up to code as far as
efficiency as far as the CPU goes I
think this is a I looked up some basic
information on this system before you
came over and it's a it's a core it's an
Intel Core and core m2 which is a quad
core processor its LGA 775 and I've been
quad core I mean you could still
probably run some games or or even
convert it you know maybe build the new
system with it you've got I believe this
is eight you know this is four gigs of
RAM right two gig sticks and this is
ddr2 so we're talking like way last
generation probably not the fastest Ram
that you could find on the market these
days but that's okay generally speaking
about 8 gigs is like the new standard
it's like the new norm for a gaming PC
and then this is the video card now this
is I know the original card in here was
a was a 9500 GT from from Nvidia but
what happened with that if you did it
fry or did you just say like I'm a
better option
popped it out like a friend of mine
bought a new one okay and so I think I'm
pretty sure it's like a hand-me-down
from your friend but nonetheless I think
it is an HD 67 17 so it's an HD 67 70
which is um you know better than better
than your 9500 GTS Raider and I think
you also mentioned something about this
fan in the back dying as well right
yeah I don't know when it happened this
around here I can't remember the last
time it works it's it's good that we're
moving on to a new system because you
put this fan dead and such limited
ventilation on the front of this case
and I don't think there's any fan at the
front here either so you really have no
intake or exhaust fan in this case
that's functioning properly at the
moment so I'm really glad that we're
gonna get that all fixed up for you but
this is thing still work I mean it still
works right it still runs all right so
why don't we try plugging it in and you
have some games installed on here yeah
okay cool let's let's let's try to run
some games I'm very curious to see how
we do all right man so we have your
system all hooked up now that's
connected to this monitor right here
we've got some peripherals going so why
don't we just turn this thing on and
basically first off let's see how long
it takes to boot up I'm kind of curious
myself it does just like a chicken where
your heart kind of sinks for that split
second but it looks like it's gone all
right we got a splash screen very nice
all right so took us a little while
maybe about a minute there two axes like
fully oh yeah now I forgot to mention
this also before but you're running a
500 gig mechanical hard drive in here
it's the only drive in the system right
yeah cool so okay the taskbar is filled
there we go
hi cons success all right cool semi
success I think yeah for sure absolutely
I think we have an internet connection
here so we can hop on to either one take
your pick World of Warcraft or League
all right so what do we got here there's
world of warcraft right yeah I'm not too
familiar with the whole and the most
seen but but this definitely does look
like World of Warcraft and it's looking
a little flip bookie we haven't even
engaged in any kind of battle yet but
we're seeing about six - we're seeing
about 10 frames per second right now
using fraps but I think let's try
bumping down the settings to low and
it's like the lowest possible setting
and
see what the most performance you can
get out of this I want to take off any
filtering any any anti-aliasing and now
you can see we are at a steady 78 frames
per second about alright and now what is
this is one of those brains yeah come
out of here okay
so we're gonna try to kill them
definitely a lot more intensive yeah its
dropped significantly we're at 32 frames
per second now this is the lowest
possible setting that you can that you
can put into place okay so we are at
zero frames per second so how would you
laughs step up your game
beyond zero frames per second right
right I would imagine so I would imagine
that this low this really low FPS is
probably attributed to the one gigabyte
frame buffer that you have on the the HD
6770 your video card it's on a 128-bit
bus but one gig of video ram isn't
typically the best suited for a 1080
gaming scenario you're gonna want at
least two gigs for that which your new
card definitely will have but also I
think the four gigs of memory is also
holding you back quite a bit as well I
think we checked it and you're at about
85 to 90 percent memory usage just
playing this game alone with no other
applications running so that could
definitely also take a turn in in a
gaming performance as well but this is
this is making me kind of nauseous so I
don't know Brande Brande what do you
what do you think about what if we take
a look at all the components that you're
gonna be putting in this new system and
then I will get building more fun than
that yeah I agree let's go ahead and do
that okay starting off with our CPU I
decided to go with the Intel Core i5
4570 since Brent doesn't do much
overclocking it made sense to save a few
bucks and opt for a non case cue he will
however still benefit from the
processors for course and six megabytes
of l3 cache to house the CPU I've gone
with the MSI z97 PC mate which is a
great budget ATX board that sports
things like 6 SATA 3 ports 2 PCIe x16
slots and Gigabit Ethernet a nice value
at just a hundred bucks my memory of
choice was this 2x4 kit from hyper X's
Fury series 8 gigs is still be unwritten
standard for most gaming rigs these days
and HyperX memory has never
failed me in the past so I'm fairly
confident this 1866 ddr3 kit will serve
Brent quite well for graphics were going
with the XFX Radeon r9 280x the card is
known for its effective cooler while
staying relatively quiet under load and
having a three gigabyte frame buffer on
a 384 bit interface isn't half bad for a
$900 system to keep our eye 5 nice and
cool I've chosen the hyper T 4 from
Coolermaster back in the day cooler
master hyper 212 earned a reputation of
exceptional price to performance and
based on the reviews I'd read from the
hyper T 4 it seems like this late
successor has what it takes to keep the
212 s legacy alive now with the fast
falling prices of SSDs over the last few
years I really didn't see a reason why
we couldn't squeeze one into this $900
rig so here we have the Mishkan 120
gigabytes solid-state drive at an
impressive 550 and 515 megabytes per
second sequential reads and writes while
120 gigabytes should be enough for
Windows 8.1 and some frequently used
programs bread will still need a
dedicated drive for his movies music
pictures and most importantly his games
which is why I've included a one
terabyte WD blue hard drive for reliable
storage powering this system is the XFX
xtr series 550 watt power supply the
unit was on sale during my part picking
process and with 80-plus gold
certification hybrid fan control and a
fully modular design I just couldn't see
myself finding a better option at the
time and finally all the components I've
elected for Brent's PC will live inside
of this corsair 200 are part of Corsairs
carbide series this case features front
panel USB 3 a black painted interior and
workable cable management making it the
killer deal for just 60 USD after all
was said and done the final cost of
Brent's new gaming PC came out to be
just under his $900 budget while I'm
pretty happy with all the parts that I
picked I did have two whole dollars that
I could have totally utilized to make
this system way better but that's
neither here nor there so at this point
sit back and relax while I build this
$900 gaming PC
alright man so your new system is all
finished the build one pretty smooth
actually I'm very happy with how it
turned out and I think it looks pretty
great too I don't know what you think
yeah I like the look of it yeah I like
the smooth front yes the kind of like
all black yeah absolutely I try to I try
to color coordinate things for you you
know I mean I don't know maybe one day
in the future if you want to gut the
system out and put it into another case
that maybe has a side pedal window that
way you can kind of appreciate the
innards you know all the internals and
stuff and matches really nice oh you
definitely got to show it off yeah so it
intimidates other people that come in my
house like bow down to you you're
clearly the boss yeah this this is
definitely a bit beefier than your last
video card to say the least
and it should also perform a lot better
too speaking of which I say we turn this
thing on and jump into some games
alright the sun's gonna go ahead and do
the honors okay and here we go system
starts up fans are spinning always a
good sign yeah you'll you'll also very
cool you'll notice that this thing stays
a lot cooler and quieter than your last
system as well even though there's more
fans in it the fans are spinning at
lower rpms they've also been improved in
terms of like their bearings and whatnot
and we're in so that's definitely the
courtesy of the SSD working for you
you'll notice that all your games that
you install in that SSD as well are
gonna load up super quick compared to
the mechanical drive in your last rigs
well first off I don't have World of
Warcraft or legal engines installed on
here I actually don't own those games
but I did install some other games some
other steam games on here so we're gonna
jump into those and actually it might be
even a more representative test because
they're more demanding than either of
those games so it'll give us a good idea
of what your system is capable of let's
place them involved never see me evolve
I've been playing some evolve lately and
it's a it's a really recent triple-a
title that came out not too long ago so
it's um it's like right up there with
with all the other demanding games I
want to say max settings we could
probably do max settings on evolve okay
when we couldn't even do the lowest
possible settings on World of Warcraft
you have your old system so that's
that's a huge step up but let's see if
I'm right
all right so we are in the thick of it
now you've trapped the Kraken officially
and you're just blasting the way out and
we're getting about 60 frames per second
still dipping into the 50s barely on the
cusp of the 40's actually yeah we just
stepped into the 40's but I haven't I
have yet to see 30 frames per second so
at the very least we're talking about 42
to 43 frames per second at the minimum
average I would say even with heavy
gameplay as you're fighting the monster
I would say you're probably getting on
average about 60 frames per second but
all in all I think this is pretty
indicative of the new kind of
performance you can expect to see out of
your new system so I'm really glad that
that you're you're a much better shape
now than you were and and hopefully this
thing serves you well from from here on
out for for many years to come yeah for
sure
Brent thanks a lot for for coming in
thank you yeah absolutely and thank you
