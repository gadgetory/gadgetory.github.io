going though you know hmm
Thanks so Microsoft weird what a stable
stable operating system but it's my
lucky episode so that's true we're all
we're all updated update on the plus
side it did occur between shows so we
lost the Twitter stream so thank you
guys for your sacrifice but we're back
live now on twitch and YouTube yay so
welcome welcome back to awesome hardware
this is episode of 188 side B if you
miss side a you can check out that on
Paul's channel Paul's hardware on
YouTube or you can follow the link in my
description it was really good
we Kaitlin had some drinks it was
amazing we occasionally have some drinks
so cheese to all of you and you know we
occasionally news foul language or adult
language so if you're sensitive that
sort of thing straight away or be warned
we have stores where you can buy things
from it's a store that sells things like
most stores do my store is big with tech
screw up confidence a screw it screw
with confidence trips are there in two
flavors bottle openers pints hoodies
eggs and then Paul store is Paul's
hardware net also things that are
similar to mine but with a Paul twist to
them a Paul Flair yes you will some some
very nice merchandise there too so be
sure to support us on those channels if
you were so inclined but yeah we we can
just drive right in jive jive that's a
combination of jump jump jive and when I
was gonna say jump and then dive I
couldn't decide between jump and dive so
I went guys gonna here let's just dive
right into our first story which is very
gently for thee
it's from overclock free to dive net
apparently a sapphire rep has spilled
the beans on AMD's Radeon Nabi lineart
Nabi you line up who do you think Nabi
your Nabi not right Nobby
no is what I've been saying yeah me too
Nabi line up so this is this is big news
user Z who's eh IH you posted online all
these details about the upcoming
AMD GPUs that feature the new Navi
architecture but that post is now
offline apparently someone told me to
take it down he got in a lot of trouble
with who knows but it's not there
anymore or fortunately we have you know
publishers like overclocked 3d to tell
us exactly what was leaked so apparently
there's gonna be this is all great
assaults this is all from some trader
from from sapphire apparently he said
that - scuse will be coming out at very
least - scuse that are going to compete
with the RT X 2060 and RT X 2070 from
Nvidia so attacking the sort of I'd say
mid to upper high-end range
midge I'm the bitch yeah the mid-range
midge sounds like a bird isn't that a
bird dragon - term for a short person
huh a bird is a bird image magpie after
all the midges on the bridge look at all
the bridge midges anyway
so 20 60 and 20 70 competitors whew
that's actually pretty exciting because
the RX RX Vega 56 and 64 can't really
compete at least with an RT X 2070 no
hardware supported rate racing so if you
were really into rate racing you're
still gonna want to probably go GeForce
r-tx or even you know gtx 1660 or TI but
no hardware supported rate racing on
these Navi cards again grain of salt but
we may see some some level of software
support of retracing it also kind of
confirms if this is all true that
there's no such thing as big Navi people
were speculating that there'd be some
full full-fledged Navi chips or Navi
GPUs that actually had rate racing
support on a hardware level and then
some cheaper more entry level options
that did not but it seems like none of
the Navi options are gonna have rate
racing if this is to be believed as far
as sapphire goes they this rep
blabbermouth also confirmed that a toxic
variant was coming out which is going to
be water-cooled so you want to put some
liquid on that Navi Sapphire is gonna
cater view in that sense but how toxic
are we talking you
I'm about as toxic as as as this guy
used to his company I mean it makes for
great news stories but wouldn't want him
working for me Loudmouth Gospel I'm so
angry at this guy it's giving me content
otherwise I wouldn't have any he also
confirmed a May 27th release which is
going to be during copy text make sense
this is kind of what we've been
expecting
I didn't say release but more of more so
an announcement with a official release
date coming July 7th about a month or so
later which seems very possible so
that's all we know
that's all we know from this huge leak
there's also been some leaks on the
actual architecture itself and GCN
architecture and stuff like that that I
saw in the hardware subreddit just
before the show started so I didn't get
a chance to actually look it over or or
comment on it but you can go look that
up very easily if you want to find out
more details about the actual
architecture again that are probably to
be taken with a grain of salt no once
again MSI x5 70 gaming plus and Pro
carbon motherboards have been pictured
both boards are mid-range and feature
active chips at coulee which is a pro or
con depending on who you ask it's got a
fan could be good for cooling it could
also mean that these chipsets get overly
hot and noisy if that fans noisy then
that's not good either
hopefully there's an on/off switch - to
let users choose what they want PCI a
Gen 4 of course 8 + 4 pin EPS connectors
on these boards if you need a little
little extra juice for your risin 3000
CPU but I think the boards look pretty
pretty standard you know pretty familiar
with what we've seen from MSI in the
past the carbon will looks very carbon
yeah this is carbon looks fine looks
good um sharp clean if you're into
carbon fibre and then what is there a
picture the other one looks like there's
already I don't know what the RGB
lighting on the right yeah gaming mummys
lost
there's the gaming + so it's got some
red accents and you know so so yeah GB
hey I mean I don't get the benefit
right you don't like the rgba edge edge
lighting I don't know I'd like to see
more lighting on the actual board than
like because it just kind of looks weird
like I sometimes see hotspots reflected
on the motherboard I can depend on the
case because yeah sometimes you have you
know gaps there for passing cables
through right I feel like a lot of
systems I've put together and the light
has lit up there and I've chose the one
exception is in the the dark Bass Pro
700 because the dark Bass Pro 700 from
be quiet the white edition we installed
a thickness in asrock no no is a death
extreme actually with that edge lighting
and it reflected on the white paneling
of the the case so well that it almost
looked like the case had the LEDs
integrated and it was a system that I
built for be quite at their suite at CES
this year and they were like that looks
amazing we didn't even expect that to
happen
but I guess a camp I guess you can't
look good depending on the building it's
all subjective of course most people
will just probably say screw RGB and
disable it but those are X 570 boards or
a messiah
that's it Google glass Google no I'm not
talking about Google glass now I will
talk about that really soon but cooler
master cooler master yes cooler master
has a truck you know the cooler master
has a land truck its master master ride
truck hits the road 10 player land set
up inside whoo
so it's got 10 full blown systems I
thought if I read in another article
that it mighta been 12 but at any rate
it's a pretty pretty baller looking
setup they've got of course all the
system's decked out with Coolermaster
hardware there might be another picture
down below pall of what the inside looks
like here yes yeah you can see that is
actually pretty pretty swanky like the
they have like a nice gaming chairs for
each of them you can set up systems on
display behind we have to cool you get a
monitor for the person playing and then
a secondary monitor which I imagine is
going to be mirrored so people can watch
and
you know you don't have to look down it
there you can look and see what's
happening up there yeah
got some straps in here so that when
they do a bunch of donuts as you're
playing the games just you know provide
more immersive experience yeah you only
have one real safety you can no respawns
in real life looks like you've also got
you know full pedals instead you're
having dragging same setup with the
pedals and steering I hope that goes
away easily if you want to just use the
keyboard and mouse though yeah that is
that would be the kind of challenge
there is how they how they're
accommodating that very it's cool though
yeah it's gonna be planning to tour
around Europe first its first stop is at
anime con the anime con game room in
Rotterdam Holland you can follow the
Coolermaster twitter for details
probably like the UK twitter I would
guess has more details on it or maybe
their Facebook but but yeah the systems
look nice I think those are H 500 P mesh
or the a400m
rather than by the EM which are super
next cases looks like there's a 240 rad
on the cpu AO and I believe those are
our TX 2080 TI &amp;amp; masaya lightnings
thanks yeah pretty baller
that's a pretty cool trip I think it
looks very very nice I agree they did a
good job in the design let's move on to
my last little news article here Google
glass Enterprise Edition 2 launched at
999 999 but a cool grand who set you
back for one of these this is not again
it's an enterprise it's an enterprise
edition so it's mainly for people who
are working it's not for like leisure
like you're going to the coffee shop
this is like now you work at a factory
and in a factory new your designer I
don't know
so Google has been quietly improving the
the Enterprise Edition over over the
last few months or maybe even years they
just launched the Enterprise Edition -
it's got improved everything they've
improved it across oh geez improved
construction compatibility with various
safety frames there's a the tech specs
have been vastly improved we'll talk
about that in a sec there's a new AI
engine
camera USB see for faster charging and
longer battery life so these are cheaper
these are 500 bucks less than previous
gen wearables which is going to make it
more affordable for employees or
employers to
by other employees the glass wearers can
access checklists view instructions or
send inspection photos or videos which
results in faster production times
improve quality and other benefits
I can see Amazon picking these up for
their their delivery service you know
how do you sometimes you'll get a
picture I will text you a picture of
your delivery like the box at your door
shit like that I never get that oh
really
sometimes I'll get an actual picture
sent it's like we put your box on the
side of your house or whatever yeah I
could see this coming in handy with that
where they just kind of look at it like
a take photo woman me Nene sorry I would
love to see a video I'm sure Linus will
do this at some point like comparing how
much more productive employees are with
this technology versus without it to see
if it's if it's all fluffed and stuff
and it's all hype and just a gimmick or
if it actually does improve productivity
and and if so how much
but the I want to know that too yeah the
Qualcomm Snapdragon XR one platform is
what's being used has a much faster
quad-core CPU at 1.7 gigahertz natively
supports vision processing six degrees
of freedom position positioning tracking
and 3d accelerated graphics supported by
three gigs of lpddr4 ram 32 gigs of EMCC
flash emmc flash storage 802 211 Wi-Fi
and bluetooth 5 8 megapixel camera which
is an improvement from 5 megapixels with
the last gen and it has an activity
light on the front so people know when
you're recording or taking pictures of
them streaming whatever so do you feel
like they kind of tried to design it to
look more like just a normal pair of
glasses I definitely think so it looks
like some Ray Bans almost because the
original you know the original Google
glass got such a blowback after after it
was out for a little bit yeah for
anything like a Dragonball Z yeah and
your energy scanner or whatever and just
people kind of creeped out because
somebody wearing that it's like you
don't know if they're recording or if
they've got some give us two SEC's
it goes to two SEC's no not two seconds
your videos that rate has been changed
Oh for you to live compatibility sure
sure why not okay
sounds reasonable we're about to go live
to YouTube give us a moment okay sorry
about that guys
don't know what's going on I will I will
look into the matter though as soon as
they get back from Computex in like two
weeks I will get that up just enough yep
but we're going to dive straight into
pip my PC or I'm sorry yeah pin my PC
I'm just gonna confuse my other series
and we're gonna go through this
relatively quickly because I don't want
to keep be sodding and then coming back
is a little frustrating so we're gonna
go through these relatively quickly
start about that maybe we'll do a longer
one next time we do the show so we have
Ricardo with an i7 7820 at 4.8 degree 2
X 1080 CI for the win 3 gigabyte X $2.99
gaming 7 motherboard and a Corsair 900 D
case so very nice setup thank you for
sending pictures of that looks like
you've got a lot of soft tubing in here
I'm not gonna knock soft tubing because
I think it can look nice but I think
maybe there's some additional slack in
some of these runs that don't need to be
this long I feel like there's a way to
make soft tubing look a bit tighter like
you're Riptide Riptide looks very nice
thank you all soft soft tubing but it's
not completely stretched now it's like
the length the perfect length all the
tubes are at the cut the perfect length
they need to be and it looks very clean
this looks like you could shorten those
up a little bit I spent a lot of effort
on that I could tell thank you oh that's
great your shitty recognition I know as
a builder I know effort when I see it
and everything else looks pretty good it
looks like you could use a serious
dusting that a fan at the bottom looks
pretty pretty gnarly cable management I
mean I see that there's like a cable
running from what looks to be your GP
water block like one of the fittings
like where the inlet or outlet is what
does that possibly a temperature sensor
okay
maybe there there little G and a quarter
there basically it's like a it's like a
cap uh-huh so you just you just put it
over wherever you have a G and a quarter
opening
where we're flow is gonna be going by
and then you run that over it's like a
temperature sensor head around your
motherboard that's my guess
all right so is the sensor actually in
the water block so it's like measuring
the temperature of the sensor just it's
it's like imagine you have a Gina
quarter opening yeah and then you have a
cap right the cap just has a little
sensor on it oh so when you put it on
there water is going to flow past it so
that sensor is gonna be able to tell the
temperature of the liquid okay
well yeah that's that's what I was
wondering okay cool okay all right well
that looks a little a little loose as
well I mean it's kind of distracting but
there's definitely potentially other
places he could put it yeah you can get
a little 3-way like a square square
fitting yeah it has like an inlet and
then two outlets you put that anywhere
along there and just put the cap on the
side of it no thatthat snap looks like
he's got some quick quick disconnects
though that's cool yeah that's really
useful for actually being able to do
some maintenance on a water cooled
system yeah so just say take care of
those things and give it a nice cleaning
yeah put some love thanks Matt since we
build though I mean like a crazy crazy
nice over the top yeah sorta killed
mother well mess we have good old 8-bit
NZXT th 500 arisin 320 200 G's got an
asus rog strict's x3 7 TF gaming
motherboard and I had a GPU but it
recently sparked up and sort of blew up
so now I only have the graphics on my
2200 G okay the two truck fans are
Corsair 140 millimeters and the top is
the stock NZXT one okay well obviously
get a GPU and when you can and I would
say maybe some cable extensions because
the kitchen and mustard isn't doing you
any favors here yeah I would also
suggest mmm
tidying up your cable management
particularly where the the CPU water
block is it looks a little like a
haystack just a bit maybe can be routed
a bit more cleanly through those
heatsink so around the memory up there
yeah zip ties are your friend I was
gonna say especially if you're gonna add
a GPU back in there consider moving or
reorienting your all-in-one cooler
you've got some again some some soft
cable drooping going on here yeah that's
a theme that's the theme
I spent my PC segment which would impact
would that be touching the GPU I'm
pretty confident with most GPUs yeah
and that's that's kind of a little bit
of a faux pas for us so if you flipped
it and had them coming from the top you
might be able to loop them around you
can also potentially flip your cooler
itself just those various options you
could have confronted that around the
front if yeah that's another that's
another possibility
so does it that would that would clean
things up nice-looking belt though yeah
thanks coalition gaming hey coalition
that sub $600 RTX 20 60 build okay it's
got an HP z400 workstation motherboard
is Aeon W three six nine zero Intel it's
two you overclocked 14 Hertz talking's
of RAM and ROS little tire thing case
suck $250 form yeah okay Oh interesting
Wow that is quite a built it's almost
like it's RGB on its own without LEDs
because it's so like the board so
colorful it's kind of like this off
green teal almost like an aqua that's
like the saturation has been turned up
on this yeah right I was gonna say it
looks very like vibrant yeah they're
nice pictures very anything there this
is a nice style going on me okay
sorry limping goes I mean how much you
can do
yeah cuz I mean you've already got what
looks like you know a pretty utilitarian
kind of build again when you've got the
green PCB there's only so much you can
do but you know it's working out okay
for me here obviously as usual the
cabling for the power supply is not the
prettiest so that could look better for
something like this I would say if you
wanted to actually pimp it out just go
run with the wind with that aqua color
and make that your theme color black and
aqua I'm able look sick if you actually
like painted other parts that exactly if
you could find like a paint that was
exactly that color customize the GPU it
could look
cool and then all of a sudden that that
motherboard isn't an eyesore it's not
standing out but it's complementary to
everything else in the system but the
GeForce r-tx logo on the r-tx 2016 9
matches with the motherboard this that's
another mr. nice thing ok very sweet
unique build their explanation next up
we have a Vincent M R ls3 40 r5 1600
from risin vengeance our pro RGB D or
for our X 480 gaming X and it looks like
an ax pantyhose as an air filter because
I gotta buy a 140 millimeter fan for a
140 filter it's exhaust but dust comes
in when the computers off okay so
pantyhose that's innovation I appreciate
that
yeah I like I like your GPU sag solution
here with that looks like a piece of
balsa wood or something right okay hey
whatever gets the job done
you know maybe spray paint a black over
it yeah it's at an angle to I if this is
wood I mean and you do anything with
carving or painting or whatever I mean
you can I feel like you could maybe
customize that it comes out because you
know it's just the bare wood which
doesn't really fit with the rest of the
of the builds but that could be a fun
thing ya know project at the same time
your SSD is also standing out just
doesn't blend in very well you know you
could pull the label off of that and
spray painted black and love you nice or
red red would be gum pop yeah I had the
one there no that would blend things in
I wouldn't cost too much you know hanger
kill management is beautiful yeah looks
great you're you're working with default
black cabling from a power supply that
has that and this maybe is an EVGA one
because it has these big heat shrink
wraps on it but you've done a good job
with it
mm-hmm so well done there yeah now just
three just few little things I think
would would blend the rest of the
building pretty nicely I appreciate the
full set up picture - yeah it's
nice-looking thanks Peck phone
alright Teske NZXT s340 MSI z97 SSL I
create edition
and we've got a gtx 960 super super
clock from EVGA intel core i5 4460 yeah
I'm in dire need of a pimped out PC by
the way Vincent who he just talked about
is in chat and he says he has a spare
wood piece it's exactly as big so see
I'll see if he can customize it cool
sweet nice alright first thing I note
here is ketchup and mustard cables need
to be replaced as well I'll do that for
your yeah for your PC at least 72 is on
the VGA second it's like the girl with
the with the dress and the Schindler's
List that's what it looks like to me
right now I don't recall that part I
thought it moves so long ago the movie
is primarily in black and white he'll
knee braces color and a very few bits
gotcha so this it's like this just like
this it's a bit of color in another wise
very yes neutral black and white bill
going Jeff uh and then sorry Chet random
reference Wow remember I'm not getting
much sleep recently so I my thoughts are
very random he was such a film student
yeah and then we also have a CPU cooler
that maybe needs an upgrade because it's
until stock cooler we haven't sold it no
he's evil but not quite as cool and it's
very pretty either it's got that nasty
cable that we just don't like I agree
everything else was beautiful I mean
it's a very nice system well thought out
on all the parts except the cooler Jonah
actually have Jonah with a risin 5 this
is his first PC build so we'll be extra
harsh on them Wraith prison cooler team

aside armor rx 574 gigabyte with a
slight overclock and a Corsair CX 550
power supply
alright so I think the cabling here oh I
don't know about that LED strip that's
how here I I have to imagine that when
the side panel is armors it it covers it
maybe put it at the top though but yeah
but at the top of the case have it
beaming down
he's got your age a horse fans Kyle yeah
those are the age of horses I don't know
if I have those we keep finding these
just like super cheap
the ones are the most recent ones I
think these ones are not my favorite by
far after finding the PC cooler ones
that are made in shent they're made in
Shenzhen okay but they actually they're
actual ball bearing fans which the Asia
age of course ones are not and they're a
pretty damn good value if you watch the
video like they're they're pretty
comparable to like some premium brands
and they're like thirty five bucks for a
peck three but I would say that you need
a little bit more finesse on the cable
management here I know the case isn't
helping you with that much but it could
be a little tighter pull the cables more
taut and try to I don't know if there's
a way that you could wrap those front
fan cables any better behind the
motherboard if you could pass them
straight through through one of these
little gaps here I don't know if the
plugs ends would fit through there but
yeah yeah I'm rather than coming across
there and yeah I like Cal said just
generally tighten up some of these loose
cables up there you got some GPU sack
going so you might want to come up with
some kind of solution for that and then
yeah either remount that LED strip just
so straight or remove it and put it
somewhere else or something I don't know
it's it's hard to say without a picture
with the side panel on yeah yeah you
know that's potential definitely just
needs a little it's a little bit of work
a little tidying up yeah all right next
we have Ryan rising 5 1600 GTX 10 60 or
og 16 gigs of DDR 4 mesh fic Samsung Evo
250 gig SSD very nice build almost
almost doesn't need much correction here
I feel like this might just be a
personal choice but I prefer like for
vertical GPUs I like the the cables to
be routed behind the graphics card come
from behind come about that yeah come
from behind is just a little nice little
subtle I mean it's kind of like the
early saying like 5% of the cable at
that point but sometimes it's all you
need to just that little touch and this
looks a little bit little tortured yes
twists to get around here
strugglin this is also one of those
builds where I know this is an aesthetic
thing but I feel like the components
you've got in there you know they're
there they're good they're they're a
little bit more towards the towards the
budget side of things but then you've
got a really really nice sleeved cable
kit mmm which looks like it probably
costs a decent amount of money yeah
which I know is I feel like if we always
send mixed messages like I'll get some
extensions for those cables and then
this will wreck oh man those extensions
your upgraded your usual bit of padding
at ten seventy years right right anyway
we also know the situation
aesthetically though yeah that's true
maybe they came from an old build or
something like that aesthetically though
I think you got a really clean build at
just that that's that single piece of
advice - cow gave got that behind the
GPU yeah and I think you'd be in a think
it'd look a little better might also
like not block your intake fan there in
the front aluminum I don't know if it's
blocking in there or not
but yeah that's not what's really clean
right and then finally we have Benjamin
within a risin 720 700 G scale transy
RGB gigabyte p450 worth per Wi-Fi and
our TX 2070 with Corsair HD 120 fans and
custom Waterloo powered by a 650 G Q and
a cougar pancha case hmm okay well
interesting it looks like you've got
okay thank you Paul
we only have one more okay you can split
it we have tubing that looks discolored
in some way I'm not sure if it's
supposed to look kind of murky it looks
like it has like a green hue to it but
I'm not sure if that's just chemicals
going through it over time or if it's
already you're right or or what what's
going on there is it intentionally
supposed to be that color if not then
something's wrong it shouldn't be issue
because the tube on the Left going
through your GPU to the radiator up top
looks perfectly clear need some outside
in there yeah there's also some tubing
like I don't know I know this is the
case with tempered glass I'm not sure if
it's as much what's plastic for tubing
but it can have a natural tint you know
so that that's possible
that's a pretty heavy tan but yeah the
two rungs look fine I think the one
that's going to be from your GP to the
radiator could be a little shorter looks
like it's kind of like a little little
saggy I mean the one had going north
yeah it does have sort of a kind of
weird bend to it yes but in cable
management I think could be cleaned up a
tad like I don't like I feel like that
like just little things like your GPU
cable could be coming from it should
maybe go over that that soft tube
instead of underneath it I feel like the
the tubing should be for front and
center yeah it's kind of premium it's
like oh I water-cooled this thing don't
put cables over your tubing make the
cable especially when you haven't put
any custom cables in here make that in
the background at the foreground
like a fan or maybe a pump cable coming
up here over the memory that looks
pretty pretty loose loosey-goosey want
to tighten that up strap it down hmm
good point chat if he can afford one
it's not too big of a hassle a backplate
would be good on that GPU oh yeah
be a nice nice little finisher there and
maybe a fan at the rear I always love
fans at the rear just because they just
they look nice and they felt the space I
always feel like a building complete
without one that's just me but sometimes
you can't always put one there if your
custom water cooling because radiators
and tubing and fittings take up space
it's also a good practice for a custom
articled system that might not have as
much active air flow on it you know you
you can get the heat pockets that build
up inside the system so having a fan
that's just basically evacuating any air
that that might might get stuck in there
know is helpful yeah and I want to say
one last thing maybe get a bigger
reservoir yeah I was just yeah mm-hmm
it's a little bout space a little
Chodesh right now very chori chori
reservoir and you got space up here you
know just a little bit taller yeah you
know natural natural enhancement I think
I just had to look it up and I knew was
I knew it would be there but Joe
urban dictionary oh of course I think
that is not a chode but has showed
characteristics OMG yeah I being this
hot dude last night but as he was taking
off his boxers I saw his chodesh dick
I'm better to be Chodesh than then an
actual chewed you never you never want
to go full choke true alright that's
gonna wrap up my half of the show which
means the entirety of the show well we
do have some some more donation question
with the exception of donations that we
will read off right now
starting with bazinga X 20 bucks thank
you very much sir what the fuck ow when
will there be a baby sauce baby sauce
yeah you know we're White House tonight
we're getting the baby fever and all of
our friends all her friends are having
kids popping them out making this look
bad and our parents and our grandparents
like where the fuck's ours you know and
so now we have the pressure and that's a
it's it's when you know it's it's ready
when you're ready to have a baby
it's the best time to have a babies when
you're completely pressured into it by
all your friends and family so probably
soon have you received that as you've
talked about any of your friends who
have had kids like I go I don't so had a
kid or whatever and immediately like
when you have any kid oh yeah I mean at
least from my mom my mom definitely is
guilty of that Heather's parents not so
much sometimes sometimes her her dad
will poke and prod but it's mostly my
mom she's she's she's kind of a baby
whore which doesn't sound good yeah that
sounds something not a there's various
ways that you can interface with them
they're all bad they're all all bad I
mean the way I meant it though is not
necessarily bad it just means she's
really into babies no that sounds bad to
like really into into them alright let's
move on that's Jones $5 cheers guys I'm
happy hump day Eve and early Memorial
Day got a nice cold Stella Artois at the
moment along with the current viewers
Congrats again Paul cheers Cheers yes I
like that happy hump day Eve and early
Memorial Day every day should be
celebrated even if it's like you know a
third it's like a happy super early
Christmas you know there's always
something to celebrate
ah I like that for April thoroughly
should yes full third that's the thing
now and be sixty seven thirteen dollars
and 37 cents Kyle here's wishing you a
safe trip and enjoy Computex cheers
thank you Mike I appreciate it I always
loved Computex I love I love the trip
Alex should be making a video on the
plane right there that's gonna be fun
working on it right now actually more to
come very soon thank you man
Andrew Panero 20 bucks I have thank you
I have an 80 600 K if I gigahertz back
shed cheers Cheers Mike cheers Cheers
let me get a drink
8,600 kg 5 gigahertz an ice cream record
at 1080 60 while playing games at 4k 60
the CPU really bugs down and locks up
the system would it be better to upgrade
to an 80 700 K or Diane hurricane
motherboard is a Z 370 well a 9900 K
would be best because that has eight
cores and 16 threads 8700 K has six
cores and twelve threads yeah of course
you're talking about a price difference
of a hundred and fifty dollars or so so
if you got the money yet 9900 K will
probably solve your problem yes what
you're looking at is a transcoding thing
you're taking a game that you're playing
at a certain resolution and on-the-fly
you're you're transcoding that
resolution down at 1080p 60 that is
going to be a decent amount of load on
the CPU so you might also consider
gaming and streaming at the same
resolution that could also help you out
whether or not that's what you want to
do you know that might that may or may
not work for you but for a temporary
solution and tell you do some sort of
hardware upgrade to handle or to give
you a better solution for handling that
workload maybe try gaming and streaming
at the same resolution if you think it's
going to give like your viewers a better
experience for what they're seeing
because yeah in that case you're talking
about something that's going to affect
your gameplay and the amount of frame
the frame rate you're getting out of
your graphics card and also potentially
affecting the stream quality for your
viewers
well excuse me or ultimate solution
build a secondary system to stream hmm
which which is always best but you know
obviously another investment of money
and stuff
sure good suggestions prepping and
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
my half oh we do have Johnson's one last
thing anyone who happened to purge
purchased merchandise from our stores
gets a loud and proud Johnson if they do
right now I've been getting a bunch of
orders recently over the past week or
two yeah I don't know if it's because of
the the gamers Nexus video I did which
oh you drew attention to stores in
general right and that video did did
pretty well or if it's people just
buying stuff but thank you everyone
who's recently for wordings I only have
one direct Johnson for right now it's
from Fred are from Alabama and he got
the 15 ounce mugs cool captain
thumbscrew one that's a good one
hey Brett I have 16 16 no I wanted oh my
gosh mail is hanging Eatontown new
Joisey thank you very much for picking
up an awesome hardware roll of black
tri-blend t-shirt Johnson all right guys
that's gonna do it do we have a raid for
tonight it doesn't look all we do like
this most of our raids as usual are
suggested by our good friend and
moderator self processing so he is
actually shattered out Caitlyn shoots
the broadcasters into indicated the
channel is intended for mature audiences
that always means it's going to be good
this is okay I'll do that too pretty
much yeah and it's good so she has 27
viewers right now 27 viewers we could
probably take that to maybe a humble 500
or so let's show our warm welcome that's
Caitlyn CAI tli n shoots like the verb
she shoots to win
Caitlyn shoots go ahead and read her
tell him I sent you we sure a warm
welcome and yeah thank you guys so much
for watching we'll be back not next week
I should have announced
earlier but I'm gonna be a context in
friggin Taiwan so we won't be doing the
show next week probably the week after
I'll probably be very heavily jet-lagged
but you guys love that kind of shit
anyway so we'll see you guys very soon
have a good one Evan go read Caitlyn go
rate bye guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
