very special motherboard that promises
an uncompromised solution in terms of
reliability stability and compatibility
for your next high-end skylake desktop
this is the z170 deluxe from asus and it
comes packed with more robust features
than Inspector Gadget so before we take
an in-depth look at all this board has
to offer please hold your applause and
your drool for the end now being their
flagship z170 board we can be certain
that asus has pulled every ounce of
their resources to ensure only the
highest level of functionality be
implemented but they've also done a
bang-up job in the cosmetic Department
as well black and white accents float
above the monochromatic heat sinks which
are neither reflective nor prone to
fingerprints there is also a splash of
blue on the heatsink beauty plates
though it's subtle enough to not clash
with any color scheme in your system all
of this lies beautifully against the
backdrop of a matte black PCB one gripe
I have is with the oversized IO cover
that potentially leaves some clearance
issues with top mounted radiators
there's also a white breathing LED at
the very bottom of the chipset which
seems like an odd location the three
heatsink surround the CPU provide ample
coverage for the board sixteen phase
digi+ vrm and are linked via a
connecting heat pipe for greater heat
dissipation apart from their
high-quality chokes and MOSFETs Asus has
also added 10k rated capacitors that
have five times the lifespan of
traditional caps while retaining a wider
range of temperature thresholds both of
which are characteristics conducive to
better overclocking instability to the
right of our LGA 1150 socket are four
dimm slots for ddr4 modules with support
for speeds up to 30 400 megahertz or
3466 when overclocking beyond the
prospect of sky-high frequencies you
also get support for up to 64 gigs
thanks to the higher density limitations
of ddr4 now for users who require a
robust storage configuration that goes
beyond the realm of mainstream two and a
half inch drives I have yet to see a
board with a vast array of connectivity
options than the z170 deluxe
in addition to 6 SATA 6 ports the
adjacent SATA Express interface controls
2 ports that are backwards compatible
with two and a half inch SATA drives
technically giving you eight SATA 6
ports in total the
also one dedicated SATA Express port
that can be used with aces optional
front Bay expansion panel for effective
USB 3.1 power delivery with Intel
enabling more PCIe lanes on their
skylake chips board vendors like Asus
are also able to accommodate higher
speed drives as such there's an onboard
m2 slot for SSDs rated at PCIe gen3 by
four speeds and just for good measure
asus has included their hyper kid
adapter which connects via m2 in order
to provide support for crazy-fast u2
drives such as Intel 750 series and vme
SSD finally there's an included m2 PCIe
in card adapter which can be used for
rating multiple SSDs along with
integrated options for u2 and m2 if ever
you should find that this board isn't
meeting your storage needs
asus technical support will inform you
that the problem is you moving on to
expansion we see four PCI Express by one
slots and three PCIe gen3 by 16 slots
for up to two a SLI or 3-way crossfire
when running a two way configuration
please note that populating the
appropriate by 16 slots will force each
of them to run at by eight speeds to
ensure a superior listening experience
for users asus brings a number of
improvements to their onboard sound chip
with crystal sound 3 alongside the
isolated trace cutout for reduced efi a
pre power regulator has been implemented
for better power delivery which
translates to overall cleaner audio
noise isolation has been given a tune-up
and Japanese audio grade capacitors
bring additional warmth to the sound
signature there's also an added deep up
filter to reduce unpleasant hardware
noise when booting up or shutting down
the system
here's a quick layout of the boards 6
for pin fan headers which can all output
a PWM signal among them are two CPU fan
headers which are primarily used for
things like push-pull air coolers or
liquid AOS and a dedicated pump header
for water-cooled supported pwm pumps
bear in mind all of these can also be
utilized as a standard 4 pin fan header
if need be I'll admit that I'm not
particularly thrilled with the placement
of these two fan headers as they're
quite a stretch away from most case
grommets which might not facilitate the
cleanest cable routing now while
generous pwm fan connectivity is always
appreciated
Asus also understands that this is only
part of the solution when it comes to
defining a boards thermal dexterity so
they've included several temperature
sensors at various hotspots around
bored much like their x99 sabertooth
there's also a temperature lead that
allows you to manually place an
additional sensor anywhere in your
system with the help of these thermal
input sources users can then define
individual fan curves based on the heat
values of these specific regions
enabling a better cooling solution
that's dynamically tailored to your
various workloads scattered across the
rest of the board is a collection of
other handy features including a memo k
button which can allow your system to
post despite having certain memory
related issues this pertains to things
like initialization issues when using
memory that isn't fully compatible with
your system or if one of your dims
happens to fail over time if possible
memo k will attempt to run the failed
module at a lower operating frequency
which can sometimes help get your system
off the ground
you also get three onboard switches
including easy XMP which you can enable
to have the board automatically detect
and apply the optimal XMP profile to
your DRAM the EP you switch applies a
slight undervolt to your CPU for users
who wish to save some power albeit at
the cost of some performance and lastly
the TP you switch has two different
modes for users looking to apply a quick
frequency boost to their unlock skylake
CPUs the first mode automatically dials
in your XMP profile and applies a
moderate overclock to your CPU while the
second mode functions just the same but
assigns a more aggressive overclock for
cooling solutions that can handle the
extra heat just beneath the switches you
get two USB two and two USB 3 headers
one of which is located under the 24 pin
connector as well as a header for
connecting ACS's pwm fan extension hub
for additional fan and thermal sensor
connectivity moving right along we find
surface mounted power and reset buttons
a clear CMOS button and the ever so
useful USB BIOS flash back button for
updating or fixing a corrupted BIOS the
trusty Q code LED makes its return with
its troubleshooting ability to pinpoint
an issue in your system should you have
one the red LED will display an
alphanumeric code which you can then
reference in the user's manual to
quickly narrow down the problem to help
you further diagnose potential issues in
your system asus has also placed four q
leds by the cpu dram vga and boot device
in the event that your system fails to
post due to an issue with one of these
parts the corresponding Q LED will lock
red at which point you can then attempt
to reseat the affected component or take
the appropriate steps to troubleshoot
the issue
next to the debug LED you'll find a
thunderbolt header for connecting a 2.0
expansion card with optional future
support for thunderbolt 3 and while it's
quite easy to miss neighboring the top
PCIe slot is a key Express controller
this supports asus is gamer centric
feature that allows you to expand the
functionality of your keyboard by
assigning useful tasks to your keys like
switching the audio output from your
headphones to your speakers or powering
on and off your system rounding out the
features with our rear i/o you get an
optical Toslink out full-sized HDMI and
DisplayPort and 3x3 connections for 802
11 AC Wireless and Bluetooth that
feature packet prioritization which can
be configured in the turbo land software
the included antenna features a magnetic
base and swiveling top for easy
positioning also on the back you'll find
no shortage of USB 3.1 ports 5 type A
and 1 type C port offer up to 10 gigabit
per second transfer speeds and support
for the integrated USB 3.1 boost feature
which offers improved performance for
supportive external storage devices the
top right port can also be used to quick
charge Android iOS or Windows Mobile
devices through AI charger plus a
feature that supports concurrent
charging and data transfer and the
ability to continue charging when your
system is powered off to Intel Gigabit
Ethernet ports are available for Wired
connectivity and like the wireless
option can be configured to utilize
packet prioritization as well the single
USB 2 port takes advantage of the USB
bios flashback function and the USB 3
port supports the key Express macro
technology we mentioned earlier finally
here's a look at our 8 channel audio
outs which are powered by the board's
crystal sound 3 now despite how fun it
is to watch a motherboard collect dust I
decided to grab some parts and take the
board for a spin
upon booting into the BIOS you're
brought into easy mode which gives you a
comprehensive list of your system
settings at a glance Advanced Mode opens
up a more traditional UEFI where you can
do things like BIOS updates and
overclocking speaking of which I did
manage to hit a generous overclock of
4.7 gigahertz on my 6700 K at 1.31 volts
while maintaining rock-solid stability
not half bad for the few minutes I spent
tweaking the core ratio and voltage and
I suppose that is all I have to say
about the z170 deluxe who I was a lot of
information but apart from the beautiful
job asus has done with the board's
aesthetic there's enough support for
bleeding edge Hardware here for just
about any mAh
enthusiasts everything from the on board
features to the sheer breadth of storage
configurations demonstrates a rare level
of thoughtfulness that's been poured
into the engineering process to deliver
a truly flexible and robust solution
while the retail price of three hundred
and twenty dollars certainly puts this
board out of reach for most users
wallets I have seen a handful of more
expensive boards that simply lack the
same caliber of quality and
functionality Asus has always been known
for their tenacity and striving for
excellence when it comes to their
diverse product line and from what I've
gathered today it would appear that the
z170 deluxe has brought them one step
closer to their never-ending search for
incredible but that is gonna do it for
now guys let me know what you think of
