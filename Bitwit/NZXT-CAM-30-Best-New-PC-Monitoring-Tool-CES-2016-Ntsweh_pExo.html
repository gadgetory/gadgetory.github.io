else do you want me to say what's up
guys welcome to awesome sales network's
coverage of CES 2016 I'm here at the
NZXT suite at the what hotel are we in
we're in cosmopolitanism don't but don't
cut don't come here I don't want to see
any of you guys don't worry as pizza
don't do any of that but I'm here with
fawn how's it going fun how you do today
it's great we're showing up the new 3.0
interface okay we're gonna talk about it
here awesome all right so I've I'm a big
fan of cam so far I've been using it
with my NZXT hue plus but there's a lot
more to cam than than just playing
around with lighting it's also a great
monitoring software and it was pretty
good to begin with but you guys have
done some some pretty drastic changes
recently that are available as of now
correct yes
so with 3.0 it has some very new
interesting features as you know cam
with cam if you sign up for account our
data is stored to the cloud what we're
able to do now is actually for like
temperatures we can actually pull the
data from from the user base and for
example we can tell you if you have a
certain CPU like for example you have
with the new skylake 6700 K we can
actually tell you what the average item
and then what the average low
temperature for that specific CPU among
all users in our in our database the
other kind of big feature that we have
for a 3.0 is display your most recent
sessions with your FPS data can tell you
what your men max and your average is
and you can go back through the cam
software and look at your graphs we had
complaints initially from the first
person that it was very high resource
and we took a lot of time to you know
cut down on that and through with 3.0
it's actually even more optimized so
even though we added more features we're
actually using up less CPU and RAM but
yeah it's it's it's really
3.0 you can think of it as a really
polished 2.0 version and but we we put
in you know even more features for
gamers and enthusiasts awesome dude I
can't wait to like just install the
update as soon as I get home from CES so
