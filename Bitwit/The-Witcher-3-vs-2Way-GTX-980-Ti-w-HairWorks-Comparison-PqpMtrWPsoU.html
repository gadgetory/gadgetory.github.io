channel today we're doing something a
little bit different than the everyday
unboxing or review today I'm gonna be
checking out the Witcher 3 which is an
awesome game from from what I've heard
I've actually never played the other
witchers and I've never even started
playing this game until about a day or
two ago but I've actually had this game
for quite some time now for a couple
months a few months ago my good buddy
cell cell processing go ahead and follow
him on Twitter he gave me a game code to
this game mainly for benchmarking and I
haven't gotten around to it because I've
just been so swamped up until now so I
thought I would do a video on it now
granted there are a ton of Witcher 3 PC
performance videos already on online
some which are really good in fact if
you haven't seen Joker's content go
ahead and check out Joker productions on
YouTube he does some really great
Witcher 3 content with his ridiculous
gaming PC and you should just subscribe
to his channel in general because he's
got a lot of good tech content out there
but I figured I would still chime in
with my two cents no J pun intended just
because every system in every scenario
and every user is gonna be different
speaking of which I've got a hotline PC
I say that like it's some mass
manufacturing thing oh it's one of those
hotlines
this is Highline my custom water-cooled
PC that I built a few weeks a few months
ago it's got a 59 60 X as well as two
gtx 980ti s in sli very high-end gaming
machine so because of that I'm gonna be
gaining at 4k that's the resolution that
we're gonna be focusing on for the
purpose of this video and I'm just gonna
see what kind of quality settings I can
get away with and also we're going to be
checking out things like hair works why
don't we just jump right into it hey
let's let's do that I'm gonna give you a
look at my system settings alright so
you can see I'm running a 4k as I
mentioned actually let's look at the
post processing I am not enabling
anti-aliasing at all simply because at
4k you really can't tell the difference
in some games you can there are some
games where I've noticed the difference
like in GTA 5 I can tell I can tell
there's a little bit of jaggies I mean
it's just a little bit but it's there I
can't tell at all in Witcher 3 so I'm
leaving it off at this resolution
just because it'll give me a lot more a
lot more performance in the long run
of course now even more heavy heading
than anti-aliasing is Nvidia hair works
and when you when you actually enable
this setting in gain it automatically
applies an 8x msaa filter to all the
hairs that are being rendered primarily
the hair that is on the protagonist in
this game his name is Geralt I'm gonna
pronounce that wrong at some point if I
aren't already I'm not already so it
applies an 8 X NS a filter to his hair
which is pretty intensive and you take a
huge performance hit because of that and
there's no way in game to actually bump
that setting down you either have 8x
msaa or you have hair works completely
disabled but why don't we just dive
right into exactly how to change the
various quality settings of hair works
so like I said you have to go out of the
game it's not there and I already have
the window popped up here so in my local
C Drive
I've got gog Games sorry steam I
betrayed you this time around and in The
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt folder you're gonna
go to bin and then config and then base
and in the base folder you'll find
resources go ahead and click that opens
up this nope it's not resources I take
that back it's rendering open up
rendering close resources open up
rendering I'm not gonna edit that out
I don't care and at the bottom here
towards the bottom you'll see a line
that says hair works AAA level equals
and then a value and obviously like I
said it's gonna start off at 8 8 X msaa
you can change that value excuse me mm
to 4 2 or 0 each one going down in
quality but also stepping up in
performance which equates to more frames
per second and I actually have a chart
here that I created look at all this
fancy stuff fancy data
I love charts charts and graphs and and
lines and numbers they're great so
keeping in mind this is at 4k this is
being tested at Ultra settings and
average frame rate on the left side here
so just starting off on the right side
and it's kind of weird but this is hair
works disabled and I was getting 60 67
frames per second on average without any
kind of hair works at all as soon as I
enabled it which is 8x by default it
dropped all the way down to 53 frames
per second on
average which is a huge huge hit granted
his hair looks super sexy but honestly
not worth it so what happens if you
crank it down to 4x MSAA
what is the performance cost versus the
cosmetic effect so you do go up 3 frames
per second on average which is a decent
bump I suppose and that's with very
little to no degradation in quality as
far as like the naked eye could see I
couldn't really tell much of a
difference other than the very tips of
the finer strands of hair that's when
you really start to see a drop off in
qualities with the really fine tips of
his hair
but even then at 4x msaa I didn't see
too much of a difference so if you are
gonna if you are inclined to chase that
eye candy and you do want hair works
enabled I would suggest 4 X msaa as the
happy medium when you go to 2 X msaa you
do go up one frame it's really not that
big of a jump but here's where you
really start to seem even larger
drop-off in quality as far as the the
little texture the aliasing on your
drawer Jerald gerelds hair damn stupid
folklore names gerelds hair really
starts to deteriorate a little bit even
at the top and at 0 x msaa
it's just jaggies everywhere jaggies on
the the tips jaggies on the top of his
head and this isn't only noticeable in
in certain dialogue scenes but also just
when he's you know a medium distance
away from the camera when you're walking
around in the environment you can
actually see the jaggies on his head
because the hairs are so close together
that it kind of creates this weird
screen door effect across the entirety
of of his hair and it looks a bit
distorted and it's really distracting to
be honest so don't even bother with 0x
MSAA either do two or four but eight is
the other extreme that I wouldn't bother
with because four looks just as good as
I mentioned now another thing worth
mentioning is that when hair works has
enabled regardless of which MSAA quality
you habitat the hair on Geralt in
particular looks pretty stunning I have
to admit it is kind of gimmicky but when
you're zoomed in really close which
obviously 95 99 % of the game you're not
but when you are the level of detail is
pretty epic and you can actually see the
hair
appears a lot more lifelike it kind of
like flows and the way it blows in the
wind it's what we call physics folks the
physics on the hair is really good and
it kind of swishes on his back and his
shoulders very organically and it is
very pretty when you're actually up
close and can actually see it now on the
other hand when you have hair works
disabled a lot of that goes away
the hair all of a sudden looks a lot
more animated it looks a little bit more
cartoonish and you kind of lose that
organic natural lifelike feel there's
less movement overall in the wind
especially and the hair kind of no
longer swishes but it just kind of
hovers over the back of his the back of
his head and his shoulders and stuff
like that his hair also just kind of
looks a little bit more dry which i
think looks just fine and it looks even
better when you realize that there's
like fifteen to twenty percent
performance increase with his hair
looking that way as opposed to sexy
James Bond slicked back with gel if you
call it Nvidia hair gel not hair works
that's my recommendation but yeah so as
you can see I'm not a huge fan I'm not
really sold on the hair works thing
unless you just have the ridiculously
over killed system of your dreams and
you can go balls to the wall my
conclusion is that eye candy seekers
will want to put hair works at at least
4x and above I guess for extreme
smoothness but that's going to come at
the cost of a major performance head and
even high-end dual GPU setups like mine
will have a hard time consistently
averaging 60 frames per second at those
particular settings so I say in the end
not really worth it alright so switching
gears here from all that hair work stock
I'm gonna show you guys basically the
the in-game quality settings that I'm
using currently with my ridiculous
system at 4k you would think like you
could just run this game at Ultra and no
problem with my setup having two gtx
980ti x' and at first i thought that
would be you know quite possible as well
and real really the answer is it is but
what am I was my horse doing right now
I cannot come on Roge my system can
handle
this game at Ultra at por quê however
you're gonna be dipping into the low 50s
at your worst so and those really
graphically intensive scenes mainly in
combat and like just tons of like
foliage on the distance you are gonna be
dropping into the lowest low 50s which I
feel is a bit too choppy for my liking
if you go to high settings your average
my average was 68 frames per second and
my minimum at any given point was 58
now that 58 actually happens very
infrequently even graphically intensive
scenes you're still getting 60 61 it's
only just in those rare instances when
you dip into the really high 50s which
I'm okay with because there's absolutely
no noticeable change in gameplay it
doesn't seem choppy at all like it does
in the low 50s so I'm okay with with
going from ultra too high especially at
4k now what are the other quality
drawbacks from going from Ultra to fork
from ultra to hi excuse me and honestly
they're not nearly as bad as I thought
they would be for one you don't get
quite as many nice shadows way off in
the distance obviously this is a really
expansive open environment another thing
you might notice going from Ultra to
high settings is the grass density now
this doesn't change nearly as much as it
does in a game like GTA 5 for example
when you go from ultra to high it's just
like where the hell'd all the grass go
it's just like a huge difference but in
Witcher 3 there really isn't that much
of a difference and you can see here
from some of the screenshots it really
is quite negligible and I honestly
didn't even notice that some some grass
was missing going from ultra to high
until I actually had both of those
pieces of footage played back-to-back
and lastly the other thing that you
might notice going from Ultra to high
settings is just the level of texture
detail this includes things like the
sheath on Gerald's back or maybe some of
the tessellation that's on his outfit
some things like that stand out a little
bit but honestly really not too bad I
have to commend the developers for
making this game so damn scalable even
not even when the settings aren't maxed
out it still looks incredible I really
can't tell I mean maybe I just haven't
played it long enough but I can't tell
high from ultra when I'm just when I'm
in games someone could just switch my
settings on me last minute and I would
happen
but there you go that's pretty much
gonna wrap it up for this video guys I
know it was kind of haphazardly thrown
together and probably wasn't the most
polished hopefully you guys appreciate
the raw format from time to time I know
I do it's a lot more casual and a little
bit more enjoyable sometimes but thank
you all for sticking around so go ahead
and toss me a like on this video if you
enjoyed it subscribe to my channel if
you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
