might be live but in the event that we
are hello and welcome to awesome
hardware this is episode 3 i'm kyle and
i pull my colleague Paul and we have a
good show for you guys today obviously
just good not great no it's not don't
get your expectations up too much expect
the utmost mediocracy its is I mean if
nothing else we're starting a little bit
later this is actually the first week
we've broadcast a start time for the
show right so naturally really missed it
by about 25 minutes yeah we will we will
go back do some more rd and yes back
with a more accurate presentation next
week but for now we do have an
announcement before we get started into
our various segments that is that being
our good friend josh from fractal design
as most of you guys know he's a very
advocate a huge advocate of Twitter and
stuff he's he's kind of graced himself
with his presence also I'm also good
also good friend not great good friend
that's right I'm just kidding gosh
fantastic thanks for your report like
that he is doing a pretty cool
discussion tomorrow he's doing a live
stream with I the Greek so at at seven
o'clock central time that's central
right CST is central time I believe so 7
p.m. CST you interpret that everyone is
going to be discussing how to approach
vendors on twitch.tv /i the Greek so on
either Greeks you to twitch channel
sorry but it's going to be a really
interesting discussion targeted at
smaller and or aspiring reviewers tech
tubers like like myself and Paul tech
bloggers tech bloggers he's going to be
going over several topics that are
really interesting such as like the best
practice for approaching vendors when
you're asking for review samples
something that I know I always really i
had no direction at first when I started
doing this whole thing but I've had a
lot of success with leg humping leg
humping yes yes I'm gonna steal that one
see how that goes over it's like a
how about a new video card now how about
now okay video cards everywhere so in
addition is going to be doing some Q&amp;amp;A
live for you guys as well so definitely
they're going to be covering a multitude
of different topics but should be a
pretty sweet stream so go ahead check it
out again 7 p.m. tomorrow that's
wednesday at CST CST i I the Greek I
left side I left all the details to you
on this one cut I know no I have them
right here I have them right here so I
go check that out I'll type it in right
here twitch Dutch TV / I I the Greek
make sure you got that right I the Greek
I have the Greek yes that's it so uh I
might even pop in for a bit while it's
happening so pretty sweet okay on with
the news or on with our segments my
first segment this is a new one to the
show that I kind of just thought of on
the way over here actually I got to
Paul's house and I was like I should
think of a new segment and it just
popped in my head this segment is called
hot and heavy hardware yeah and like it
as you might have guessed it's about
porn no I'm just it has nothing to the
point it's actually about hardware so
Paul Paul has been very much experience
with hardware so hit you like the second
of all I hope I do youdo channel
dedicated to it that's true that's very
true of that I have no excuse other than
to like this segment all rights it so
first off basically the segment is
focused on hardware and the first bit of
hardware that I have today is the power
color radeon r9 290 pcs+ pcs plus i
think the pcs+ is power color Super Plus
powercolor special pet our color sexy
sexy plus whatever it is oh that's sexy
I think we'll go sexy so the power color
sexy plus radeon r9 290 now right Kyle
what is it about this r9 290 that makes
it special unique or different from
other r9 290 s I'm glad you asked that
Paul I have just the answer but first I
kind of wanted to speculate as to why
this is even an article being brought up
in the first place on hexxus i believe i
got this on hexxus but essentially AMD's
trying to target that sweet spot between
the gtx 960
the gtx 970 okay i think what the
article was kind of alluding to was that
nvidia has been under a lot of scrutiny
lately with there are set with her with
her are 70 with their gtx 970 with the
whole frame buffer thing the whole issue
4 gig versus three-and-a-half gig okay
of course there was a huge huge fire
over that as well as the gtx 960 just
not really meeting up living up to many
people's expectations as far as not not
not being a huge performance over the
last generation predecessor so i guess
AMD's trying to capitalize on it with
this particular card and it's supposed
to meet those those kind of sweet spot
requirements between the two as far as
price to performance goes so just a
little bit about the card it's it's a
retailing for about 280 I saw it on 280
at 284 44 for that price on newegg
that's a good 40 50 bucks less than a
than a 970 right at retail yes and it's
quite a bit more than the 210 dollar
price tag of the gtx 960 but
performances just through the roof
comparatively speaking and and they were
able to hit a performance pretty much on
par with an overclocked gtx 970 okay so
that was really good not just to stock 9
70 70 / cleft nice overclocked 970
beautiful big differentiation so that's
really cool for gigs of vram which
everyone's going to be happy about
especially you know again given the
whole 970 debacle for gigs for full gigs
a video ram that it will be able to pull
from it's a two-and-a-half slot cooler
so it's it's pretty beefy it spans the
entire 298 millimeter length of the card
so it's you know how like some PCBs kind
of extend over the cooler yeah and vice
versa this is the actual full length
it's a two and a half slot cooler it has
five thicker heat pipes didn't say how
wide the heat pipes were I'm guessing
there it has a backplate probably eight
millimeters yes it has a metallic back
plates the coolers made of plastic but
pretty nice backplate reference specs of
the r9 and this kind of interesting too
because I think how much was the r9 290x
when it when it first retailed about a
year ago is like 500 bucks 59 TX when it
launched was 550 right so this is
this is scaling back quite a bit prices
have dropped dramatically which is nice
to see and it's just it's a beast of a
card in terms of factory overclocking it
still uses an eight and 6-pin PCIe
connector and they've even added some
glue to the VRMs to mitigate what is it
what's it called coil wine Cleo lion yes
I hate color coil line it is the worst
its first-ever not exist Plus trim it
will be Pablo blah and that's that's
pretty much it so I don't to ramble on
too much more about about this card but
it is quite compelling giving me the
benchmarks that hexxus was able to run
and get on it MD has proven that in the
absence of actual new silicon or new GPU
architecture that they are quite adept
at taking their existing hardware juice
in it a little bit usually with some
type of custom cooling solution and then
rebadge it as a new card now there's
another debate to get into over that
practice as a whole however if it helps
them stay competitive with nvidia i
think it's a good thing and definitely a
290 is a really good price to
performance card from the get-go so
taking one and having it overclocked out
of the box and having a better cooling
solution i think is a win yeah so uh
yeah is this out now I didn't catch that
yeah you can buy us available yeah okay
cool everyone go buy one it was sold out
on newegg already but I think you can
still buy it on Amazon really using my
pulse affiliate link yes yes either of
ours hey or a boat with them by two yes
crossfire right to leave everything on
Amazon the news alright so moving on
with the segment my next piece of what
is the second called again we need to
hammer this home hot heavy hardware I
hope that inner geek too much that was
good that was very enthusiastic a now we
need some good graphic to throw up there
so we have a we have an SSD yes we do an
SSD news crucial MX 200 successor to the
ever-popular MX 100 MRI really like the
MX 182 there they're always like it's
like such good bang for the buck yeah
terms of SSD say the three stuff um so
basically you're looking at three
different models 250 500 and one
terabyte models okay and you'll notice
that with the MX 100 they were
actually a little slightly higher
capacity with 256 512 and a little bit
higher than a single terabyte and that's
due to this new caching technology that
they've implemented called dynamic right
allocation which can essentially use
spin and in performance single bit per
cell SLC mode rather than the usual two
bits per cell MLC ok so that's the so
that's why it kind of cuts into the
capacity that's why they're slightly
less fewer gigs on each of the drives
respectively but the end result is is
theoretically faster throughput yeah
that's something you see pretty
frequently with with SSDs is using part
of the nand itself but using a mlc bit
or a cell as a saint SNS LC cell has
gained more popularity I know samsung
also does that with the the evo yeah and
it's pretty effective yeah um so that's
a that's cool way of doing things and
I'm just I'm just happy for affordable
SSDs and that's what the MX 100 rooms
with it really all about was giving you
90 95 performance 95% performance of the
highest-end SSDs you're coming in at a
much lower price right and yeah 500 gig
SSDs or even tear I don't have a
terabyte that's it's not but I'm so
happy about them yeah and this is good
salissa should hopefully drive also
maybe the prices of other SSDs down true
even further as well yeah absolutely i
think that it's also saying something
that they're not even making their even
bothering with 128 gigabyte model now no
no just because it's such great prices
gone down so dramatic actually I was
going through my old SSDs cuz my wife's
old computer that's handed down to her
dad had ocz vertex to that failed and i
had to find a replacement i was like oh
I need to find a replacement and I have
a couple 22 50s around but those are
more useful for me yeah so I was looking
there and I have like a couple like 30
gig SSDs and 60 gb ssds and like I have
nothing to do with these there they're
good they are good for Intel Smart
Response technology rather that i will
say so yeah so there's nothing don't
don't just toss away your old SSDs even
if they're low capacity right or you
know what even if you don't have a
intel's
our response you could also use it just
for a cast drive for like premiere oh
yeah that's what I use my 64 gig crucial
m4 forced oh yeah just to have another
dry free SSD on there yeah and that's
that's another good solution for it yeah
beautiful alright alright moving on to
the next one this is the last one in the
list for hot and heavy hardware got
drive their homes now for every two good
products that I talk about in this
segment I got to talk about one that
sucks so this is the mad catz surf our
surfers surf bar should I become a seen
it and no I shouldn't okay don't do it
but I thought this was kind of silly
it's a gaming controller for Android
consoles and mobile devices with a
built-in qwerty keyboard which kind of
sounds cool in conception but i think
the review that scene that was saying is
that the this joystick there's a choices
on each side that's too small to really
game effectively if you have average or
larger sized hands that is a very small
dress but if you take a look you'll see
that like the ax + B buttons are
directly circled around the joystick
okay so it actually saves space on the
controller which I thought was kind of
innovative that's interesting and it
might even allow you to hit them a bit
quicker because they're all equidistant
away from the joystick and it's gonna be
62 pounds sixty seven bucks about sixty
sixty seven dollars us yeah wow the
conversion rate has really it's going
it's the gap it used to be 60 pounds was
at least like thousand thousand dollars
um that's pretty cool i mean i like i
got android I don't gain much on Android
so again neither do i neither do i and
the reason why even consider this in the
first place is using it for an article
is because I imagine the possibility of
using it for an htpc ah yes that would
be kind of cool so it's just the windows
and this just did like a USB nub that
sticks and may I think it didn't say if
it was radio frequency or Bluetooth but
it's a good question um to find out but
yeah I mean if it was for an htpc at 67
bucks i would i would definitely
consider it is especially because i like
the key layout i like how the keys are
kind of spaced out like there's like a
millimeter or two of spacing between
them which probably leads to less
frequent typos and stuff like that nice
to have a tiny little wireless keyboard
for furniture CPC definitely as
definitely in for sure and that
concludes hot and heavy heart all right
beautiful yeah all right so hey job Kyle
yeah we've been should do it without
taking our clothes off hey hey alright
so the next segment is also a new one
that I kind of thought out way before we
go to the next segment quick plug at the
end of this video or towards the end of
the show or the part 2 of the ship we're
going to do some Q&amp;amp;A so sweet sweet some
questions to us at our Twitter handles
which are down here below I'm also kind
of trying to monitor the chat and grab a
few questions out of there as well at
the same time but yeah we're gonna take
some questions at the very end oh thanks
okay good blood good bloke ball alright
so this this next one is called build a
rig and you guys may have seen this done
on other YouTube channels I know Logan
was doing this for a while where he
would he would upload a video no one's
ever done this before what ever does is
completely original and unique but I had
a dream once that Logan did a video on
it where he basically takes a use case
scenario pc and basically just picks out
the parts pork he doesn't actually
physically gather them together and
build it but he'll he'll like go on
websites and and pick out parts for it
whatever it may be so today's today's
segment revolves around a
four-hundred-dollar gaming pc so i
thought that was a pretty good four
hundred dollars four hundred dollars no
not including operating system I have no
precedent for this I didn't I didn't
look in any of this stuff all that's not
seen anything I just kind of threw this
together and this is the best I could
find for a lack of time and they can due
to time constraints I just kind of went
to newegg you can maybe find some parts
cheaper elsewhere but I managed to get
it right at three hundred and ninety
nine dollars and ninety four cents i was
very proud of myself that is very let
you're using up almost all of your money
that i know i know that's the point so i
want you to see the price though there's
the price case right 99-94 so i'm just
going to go down the line actually i'm
going to start with the cpu and move on
to the other components but the cpu of
choice that I went with was the the g30
what is it 1358 yeah 3258 3058 very
popular processor in this price range
which is kind of unprecedented for intel
it's a dual core 3.2 gigahertz but it's
unlocked so you can overclock it which
is awesome and it's seventy dollars so i
thought this was kind of a unique
very niche type of cpu that would work
well in something like this and because
when I think gaming pc i think
overclockable this is exactly the cpu
that i was talking about this is also
the 20 20 20 year 20 year anniversary
celebration of rcvd ocean so super cool
I was really excited to put this in the
list and the motherboard of choice would
be the biostar h81 h81 NH v 3 so 1150
socket of course 30 40 bucks 40 bucks
for an 1150 LGA h81 of course so it's
it's obviously not z97 or anything like
 upsets cut down a little bit yes
but on a micro ATX you don't have quite
as much space anyway right 41 third
motherboard and and I also did check I
did factor in like user reviews oh yeah
just two so if I saw something that got
one egg even though it might have been
cheaper I still opted for the better
better reviewed product which ID is very
important and then additionally memory i
went with mushkin mushkin offers really
decent performance for the price I
always feel like they're like kind of
like crucial in that way my vision
memory goes I'm not keeping up i'm
reading reviews on that motherboard okay
same ish so we got a Mishkin a two gig
or a two by four gig kit okay eight gigs
pretty standard at 1600 not too shabby
SSD was the 240 gig PNY optima just 90
bucks say 23 synchronous mode I was
actually surprised to find that that's
pretty nice yeah and then as far as
video card now this is going to be like
the people who will either be like yeah
good choice Kyle or people would be like
no you should have cut resources
elsewhere and save more money for a
better card I went with the 250 x no
keep in mind $400 gaming PC yeah and I
wanted to make I wanted to get a
processor that was overclockable at
least dual-core so this is the video
card that I was able to come up with
it's a hundred-dollar card and the
reviews were actually quite good i don't
know if i found the reviews on newegg or
elsewhere but um I checked the
benchmarks and I was like okay if you're
playing at 1080 even if you play some
triple-a titles maybe bump it down
medium or low and you can still get a
pretty decent gaming experience people
were relatively happy
with the card XFX is a pretty well-known
brand and that's that's just what I went
with two gigs to gig frame buffer 128
gig bus so you know great for 1080 madam
post 128-bit obviously you can't max
anything out but you can't expect that
from a four hundred or system and then
lastly intel stock cooler by the way i
didn't add an aftermarket cooler to keep
costs down and lastly the case i went i
feel like the the case in some regards
is one of those components that you can
really cut corners with you're trying to
be on a budget yes um so this one
includes a 300 watt power supply and
another one of those things where it's
like i have really had to find something
to sacrifice in order to get all the
other great hardware that's in their 40
bucks on the case and the power supply
and the power supply i was really really
pinching pennies at this point yeah but
i don't know it has 52 reviews for four
eggs I mean when in doubt look at the
eggs sure every every case scenario is
different but um I felt like this this
might be okay for this little power for
this is a little number 300 watt power
supply is probably gonna be fine oh for
sure I added that up okay granted I mean
that is that is gonna be like you know
number one or near number one on your on
your upgrade list definitely getting
that power sky out of there for sure um
but nice to get all that stuff and it
turned 40 gig SSD for for 400 bucks
that's pretty nice good job Kyle thank
you um I'm curious because I know
there's there's lots of alternatives and
with the diesel the G 3258 I've had like
at first des really happy about it but
then it like of course it came out in
the same year that like quad-core
started becoming actually somewhat
important for for for gaming I mean
granted there's still tons of games that
aren't optimized for quad core at all at
all but battlefield 4 is a big one
that's out there alright for Parker for
so that's why the G 3258 option has been
one that's been like a little bit more
hesitant to offer but if you're not
playing high in games in the 5th your
billing for dollar computer you're not
going to be playing you know if you're
not building this to play battlefield 4
that America for it and Max resin then
it's a great choice and I'm curious what
the AMD alternative to this one
me in the future we should do this one
and we'll have like lava battle with it
red lights down low fire versus Waters's
blue or something like that because with
AMD for roughly the same price for
motherboard and processor you can get a
quad core yeah and I drew them
completely blanking which skew of cpu
I'm thinking of I think it's an am3 plus
not a not an FM two plus but anyway but
nice there's a 400 ollar computers that
you guys should all go by I don't you
guys also let me know let me know what
you guys think of the computer I know
you guys are probably already coming
just missed it in the chat by yeah we
got some good comments some people were
impressed um wait but yeah I mean I
think the the SSD in there like this
would be a great computer for like even
take that video card out and for three
dollars yeah this is a great simple
basic little computer for anyone who
just needs some c4 like you know htpc or
parents or grandparents or something you
know if you're not going to be gaming
that G 3258 has an integrated graphics
to that is right and you'd be all set
for that so so I think I was like I
think next week my build every segment
should be a three-hundred-dollar
grandparent pc and i'll remove the the
250 x ok all right and a third segment
moving on here we've got another round
of face off return of your classic where
Paula nine return to the classic where
Paul and I go head-to-head in a crappy
two-player game online and and then
something bad happens to the loser um
did you choose I haven't I haven't
picked a bad to go down there I know
like I didn't have time I was just I
couldn't think of anything bad enough
cuz so far in the last two episodes
you've lost so I was trying to think of
something really bad this time did I
lose both have I lost you did I would
like to so lost a slime volleyball and
you lost it pac-man that's cuz both of
those games you had gone in and practice
extensive I did knock before hand when i
add tonight mushroom all veteran right
well if we're gonna be playing some QWOP
we're playing around I better get in
game ready I've have a lagunitas stout
here who delivery stuff raise anyone
I have in case you're wondering why I'm
drinking stone enjoy bye this is like
one of their branding things where it's
like let's make it as fresh as possible
and force people to drink it by a
certain date to get the the fullest
freshest experience this is enjoyed by
februari 14th so this is actually like
almost a month old it's like two months
three weeks old pretty decent work
cheers to all of you as well mm-hmm it's
just so God all right so we're gonna
play some co-op guys let us know in the
the chat right now right now what the
loser has to do nothing vulgar uh yeah
we needs no huge successes in chat for
what I it's hard to think up something
like that on the spot cuz it's got to be
like what like a bad I like a comment
it's gonna be bad enough for it to be a
legitimate consequence there's a fine
line with punishment again I love life
while we're waiting for you guys to
shower us with your fantastic ideas for
the consequence I'm also going to
mention that this week we're using a
webcam to broadcast which is why we
haven't gone had gotten to go over there
and switch off the camera at all or
switch it back on from turning off right
we do have a new camera that we're going
to start to use next week it hasn't
arrived yet and hopefully that one will
solve all of our problems the webcams
doing a great job so far it's probably
just not quite as as sharp as as the
DSLRs work alright so we got some insane
suggestions what I really like shave
shave their face shave their face we
have to shave our face no what do you
mean no if I hadn't branded this then
yes we could have but this is like
Howard how are people going to your
you're a man it'll grow back by your
next video how will people by you're a
hairy white man these are inside out
don't be a baby that's I I will look
12like nation neither of those are my
shirts I was trying to do a shameless
product placement of my shirt so Chad
conveniently placed there but those are
just normal shirts without my little
assignment all right um so wait what no
we're not shaving I thought I thought
that was a great idea okay other ones
include
someone gets to drink someone else's
beer that wouldn't work for me because I
have to drive home yeah Kayla's gotta go
I would help Cal's a DD for today start
next week nice and easy stream drunk
like we already halfway do that sort of
um what double triple worm huh maybe
should just play with guns before the
name put it epic game shut up all right
I don't know Alex I like the shame is
like the shade people hate camp I have
to make videos tomorrow I can't no one
will notice everyone will know I would
see if something like it's just
something like a shave something that's
gonna have a lasting effect like I'm not
opposed to that but you can't spring it
on me I have to be mentally prepared oh
I have to we were so inflexible I know
exactly that's how I get out of things
all the time not a geek said if you lose
the soul patch your channels doomed
that's that is true is this true all
right so a quap is a QP no I i I'm I'm
gonna be 0 and b uo and b which is the
difficult could it be i'm gonna be the
cabs and you're gonna be the size oh oh
no no I thought I was gonna say or do
suggest you do like three runs and will
record your best score and then I'll do
three realize I've never played this
before it doesn't matter i know it
seemed i played it a million times i
have no idea how it works no idea all
right it's just there's no real mechanic
to it well i'm sure a lot of you and
I'll be like yeah there's me can't your
fees physics-based it's a physics-based
shooter you without guns a track with
the runners all right buttons to control
their legs all right let's let's do it
okay you're gonna tomato wait oh I'm
starting oh yeah it's the all right your
place again hold on take control ideally
you around a hundred meters mm-hmm I'm
ready all right point three there we go
point 3 i'm recording this y ou point 3
why did I die press space to reschedule
no that's like what I get three shots at
this yeah and are we doing cumulative
or just the the longest single run you
really thought this out didn't you let's
do it let's you bless your humor
cumulative because that's what I planned
initially exactly okay so yep 0.3 wow I
got one point through there West can't
like I I think he hyper-extended you
like quadrupled your score something
going around he's pretty good mentioned
i have this so the next round i should
make the full thousand meters that's
right is that even possible in this game
some I bet there's youtube videos people
just running yeah well this was just
straight back onto his head uh students
fascinating all right there's no way the
skin you I don't even recall your score
because it was so bad I feel feel like I
need to double check what Kyle's
planning for for face off you got one
point may be vetted ahead in time for
let's see one point four well I have
point three point two and one point
something one point three so obviously
you got like 1.8 yes all right I'm
calculate it won't matter Paul this is
kyle just exactly like roads alone
thanks for doing backflips to say
nothing of the fact that you have me
here to start it for you or as I had to
use my hand in your state exam yes of
course there's so many every advantage
possible all right let's do this hey um
moving long-living look ready why aren't
my message and go there we go your
starting point up there we go watch this
I'm gonna beat your best it's all about
few things backwards that's part of the
plan and it's like you out I did not
know you could just juggle along on your
knees no you should have researched this
god I knew it would happen I've already
beat you my first run two meters high
winds let me just fall over net but I
need to fall over this is because if I
don't step back up Oh
oh you could still go backwards Oh could
still you have clearly played on us no I
have it much more than I have it I'm
just I'm just naturally good at games
else to explain this is this is just the
type of thing that comes naturally to a
pro my god when we go look at me go yeah
the least seven freakin years dude
bummer that is actually the best I've
ever done in this game believe it or not
i usually do what you do i'm gonna go
not swear to god you have music wherever
I've impressed myself game Lauren Polly
so Paul will shave his soul patch yeah
tomorrow exactly that was agreed upon or
Kyle needs to draw one thing on your
forehead okay the forehead drawing thing
can be done when you're doing behalf
because I'd be cool with it for the rest
of you on my segment but with no
explanation for my half of the show I
don't think that's the best way yeah
alright well we'll figure it out we'll
report back to you guys and let you know
that what all punishment was okay I will
she has a nerf gun it'll be fun I'm nerf
gun yeah first if I said earth gun
something is my craft row rocks at you
this is ruoxi earth okay all right that
was a fun that was a fun around I'm glad
we played QWOP all right and now let's
go into a more serious note with some
news some tech news a little bit of
stuff from GDC that's going on right now
as well as one more hardware type story
because I couldn't fit it all in in hot
and heavy hardware and then we'll finish
it off as his face couldn't fit all that
hot and heavy Articuno today huh no no
in he tried yeah I know just couldn't I
know do it I think with flippity button
all right this first one I found is
about valve and they announced their
steam link and source 2 engine yeah
steam link is actually a product and was
they announced this at GDC it's a new
product from valve that's been designed
to extend a user's stream experience
it's that where that was supposed to go
please can to to any room in their house
basically bye-bye excuse me by streaming
steam content from any pc across the
same local home home network so what I
think of this is it's kind of like it
just connects to your TV via hdmi and
it's a stream box and you can stream all
of your games from your pc to whatever
TV in your house is that is that the
impression you got yeah that's like this
it's a fifty-dollar streaming device so
but it's designed specifically or
Christine yeah and which is also pretty
cool because because right now I can
stream any steam game from from my my
personal desktop computer to my my TV in
my living room because i have an htpc
hooked up to it but is instead of having
an htpc you could just get a steam link
for 50 whatever hold on okay I'll hold
on breaking news okay steam leak has
been cancelled what I just kidding Jesus
i'm kidding i'm assuming that because
steam link which used to be a link to a
the steam store where you could buy it a
different steam link not there anymore
the leg just steam link is that that's
where your time no this look yeah i
clicked on this one earlier and it
linked to the actual product page on
okay so steam link is still for sure but
steam length link has been cancelled its
team link link to seem link is no longer
linking alright cool so some other
information about it does support steam
machines wow it's rising linux pcs
windows pcs and macs at 20 sorry hun 20
at 1080p 60 Hertz beautiful with low
latency i think that's really nice it
will retail for fifty dollars in the US
and will be also be available with the
steam controller for an additional fifty
dollars 50 bucks more for the controller
yeah yeah that seems a bit so that's a
little snow maybe it's just got some
real enemy i mean that the xbox
controller was forty bucks for
controllers are cheap man a long time
yeah i guess if it's okay if it's if
it's loot i I don't know I was just I'm
in the PC mentality where things should
be cheaper i guess a little right no yap
so 50 bucks seems a lot that i guess
when you compare it if it's really well
made but thing and if it's one of those
types of controllers that just last
forever and
right for rugged and all that kind of
stuff then then maybe that's more worth
it true and then and i also have to ask
I wonder if if you can use any other
controllers with it I would think so
right like if you can use others like an
Xbox 360 controller or a pc right so
that's a good question i'll be
interested in streaming device friends
who knows i mean it might be running
some like little little basic like linux
based thing in there that it runs in
order to accept the stream and display
it on the screen in which case it might
not just allow you to plug and play at a
USB device right i'm not sure though I'm
that's so tv-g on that but very
interesting nonetheless and the source 2
engine successful to the original source
engine which is very known for creating
games like counter-strike and half-life
two and half life 3 to be determined yet
confirmed but that's that's cool it's
designed for both professional
developers as well as gamers who who
might be developed interested in
developing their own games in the future
and I think it's going to be made free
for content developers so open source
pretty much that's cool yeah sweet
that's that's all I have for that
article the next one is EVGA announcing
their gtx 960 with four gigs of ram so
forth memory buffer or gigs yeah it's
impossible for legit gigs it's weird
that that's where that this 960 will
have more center man and the 970 is
gonna have more memory than this yeah
that's it's kind of funny it's kind of
um so obviously this isn't only two
things like higher texture qualities
better 4k resolution gaming performance
and things like that they're also
claiming that the coolers new memory
MOSFET mosfet cooling plate will cool
the MOSFETs on the card about 11 degrees
celsius cooler than their their current
AC x 2 point 0 cooler so this is
actually going to ship with their AC x 2
point 0 plus there's a lot of pluses
going around the video it's a great way
to improve your products you add a plus
makes it better it's all around improves
cooling thermal dissipation that's wrong
I wanna do a shout-out to fractal josh
because he just joined chat hey if
nothing else to say that yes Josh we
plugged you talk that you're doing with
the with with by the week yeah we did
tomorrow that was the first thing we
said so we're getting like front page
anyone anyone who goes and views that
stream uh it's probably sent by us yes
or just wants to see you guys talking
about stuff feel like I was going
somewhere else with that but I also want
to say much more shout outs other people
in chat because we have some some some
longtime regulars here and I like to
give you guys perhaps reviews by gary is
here i am apropos a km apropos i'm a
purpose is also here welcome thank you
for joining us strider of course is
always straight on a geek strider and
rooster was a mistress yeah i'm gonna be
still in a straighter and rooster headed
sajan ballistic we're sprung uh we
sprung mod duties on them last week and
they're back again even though we have
not asked them to lay our Lord s custom
mods the boss you know you don't even
know we're there uh wait who else did
you see sergeant ballistics in here
what's up Brad and I was going to be
though Kitty's not here kitty um and
yeah especially since um in about a half
an hour or so not that any of you should
be aware of this nvidia starting an
event but um mm-hmm art is is way better
now you don't have anything to talk
about that's important after this all
right Kyle you have any more stories on
your stories last story story of my
segment totally switching gears here
from pier DIY pc tech is this story that
i found on a big ass black hole that was
discovered in the early universe ok so
right right after the Big Bang happened
about 875 million years after that
occurred uh this big-ass black hole was
created it's a super super massive so
this is the chart right that is the big
red one that's the big right look at the
chart just look at the chart I'd assume
this is your story I just meant we're
about the biggest I'd assume that's the
one alright are you no one would ever do
a story on a little green one are you
even gonna talk about the eddington
limit no are you yes okay you can fill
me
eddington limit because this was the
last story obviously this was the last
story though Kyle's filler story no no I
was in your kitchen writing that story
and you're like are you ready to go live
and I'm like I'm gone by riding my last
uh and I saw heading she's limit now I
was like oh hell no relate i'm not gonna
about to figure out this new new
terminology okay space i will briefly
explain from the like two seconds i
spent reading the story what the
eddington limit is so when a black hole
okay gets to a certain size right blow
what we've what we've learned about
black holes more recently not going to
be very specific here because i'm at any
research is that it used to be thought
that everything that goes in that passes
the event horizon on a black hole gets
sucked into the center and has gone
forever and that was conception that was
it that was a quandary for
astrophysicists because that exhibits a
lots of information which is against one
of the basic laws of physics right I'm
apologize to any physicists if I'm
terribly off here so there is actually a
halo around black holes where light
escapes right so that so what the
eddington limit is is that as a black
hole gets bigger and bigger and the rate
of acceleration of mass getting pulled
into it increases the amount of light
that has to be given off on the outside
also increases relatively to that
because more stuff getting pulled in
means more stuff has to come out however
the light coming out and this is where
it gets a little weird actually has a
gravitation like I don't want to say
gravitational pull actually has an
effect on the stuff going in as well
okay so you can only get to a certain
size before the stuff being pulled in
and the stuff being pulled out count
equalized that's what's known as
Eddington limit and that is what is
theoretically at least at this point the
largest size of the black hole can never
get and this black hole is doesn't have
something to do is lamination like some
is the radiation is the radiation of
light or the halo at the edge right now
it might be something other than just
like but constriction after a certain
point yes okay so that's that's my
really basic understanding and then
there might be some errors in there but
okay well yeah but obviously that very
very much ties in with this article
because the the supermassive black hole
that we're talking about here is pretty
much as big as we've seen it in the past
so it's not unprecedented we've seen
other supermassive black holes this big
but what's interesting about it is that
it's about twelve point eight billion
light-years away from Earth which means
you know you can measure the the age of
something in space based on how many
light-years away it is based on the
speed of light right so basically it was
it was formed 875 million years after
the Big Bang which is only about six
percent of the universe as life when
compared to its 13.8 billion billion
light year age so so it's like it's like
a baby it's like a it's like the grand
it's like a great great grandfather so
it's a really old it's a really old
black hole really little black hole is
there any way you can somehow tie that
into like a mild insult against Josh or
something I can't now not not on the
stream well yeah sorry i don't know i
don't quite have that that that level of
wit right exactly so that's big ass
black hole story race so that's pretty
much it cool stuff I don't want to I
don't want to drag on about black hole
stuff notice josh is in the in the chat
oh no the Wade out of atrocities he'll
come up with next so is this the end of
your size this concludes my day of a
side a of my segment so be sure to stay
tuned for Paul segment yes coming up
right now and as you guys are watching
this go ahead and a archive eject that
tape ejects site / flipped over then you
get side B by B on pulse channel Paul's
hardware also feel free to buy a shirt
from the awesomesauce merch store and
links links in the description as well
as a pulse hardware shirt from the the
pulse hardware net store yes yeah if
you're watching live we're gonna cut for
just a moment and then we'll be right
back with side B that's right thanks for
watching see you in just a moment
