might be live but in the event that we
are hello and welcome to awesome
hardware this is episode three I'm Kyle
and I pull my colleague Paul and we have
a good show for you guys today obviously
just good not great no it's not don't
get your expectations up too much expect
the utmost mediocracy it's is I mean if
nothing else we're starting a little bit
later this is actually the first week
we've broadcast a start time for the
show
right so naturally we may we missed it
by about 25 minutes yeah we will we will
go back do some more Rd and back with a
more accurate presentation next week but
for now we do have an announcement
before we get started into our various
segments that is that being our good
friend Josh from fractal design as most
of you guys know he's a very advocate a
huge advocate of Twitter and stuff he's
he's kind of graced himself with his
presence also I'm also good also a good
friend not great good friend that's
right I'm just kidding - he is doing a
pretty cool discussion tomorrow he's
doing a live stream with I the Greek so
at 7 o'clock Central Time that's central
right CST is Central Time
I believe so 7:00 p.m. CST you interpret
that everyone he's going to be
discussing how to approach vendors on
twitch.tv /i the Greek so on either
Greeks YouTube twitch channel sorry but
it's gonna be a really interesting
discussion targeted at smaller and/or
aspiring reviewers tech tubers like like
myself and Paul tech bloggers tech
vloggers he's going to be going over
several topics that are really
interesting such as like the best
practice for approaching vendors when
you're asking for review samples
something that I know I always really I
had no direction at first when I started
doing this whole thing but I've had a
lot of success with leg humping leg
humping yes I'm gonna steal that one see
how that goes over it's like hey how
about a new video
card no how about now okay
video cards everywhere so in addition
he's going to be doing some Q&amp;amp;A live for
you guys as well so definitely they're
gonna be covering a multitude of
different topics but should be a pretty
sweet stream so go ahead check it out
again 7:00 p.m. tomorrow that's
Wednesday at CST CST at I either Greek I
left I left all the details to you on
this one cuz I know
no you know I have one right here I have
them right here so go check that out
I'll type it in right here twitch TV /i
I the Greek Greek make sure you have
that right
I have the Greek yes that's it so uh I
might even pop in for a bit while it's
happening so pretty sweet okay on with
the news or on with our segments my
first segment this is a new one to the
show that they kind of just thought of
on the way over here actually I got to
Paul's house and I was like I just think
of a new segment and just popped in my
head
this segment is called hot and heavy
hardware yeah and like it as you might
have guessed it's about porn no I'm just
it has nothing to do it porn it's
actually no hardware so Paul Paul has
very much experience with hardware so
hit you'll like this second of all I
hope I do you do a channel dedicated to
it that's true that's very true that I
have no excuse other than to like this
segment alright so first off basically
the segment is focused on hardware and
the first bit of hardware that I have
today is the power color radeon r9 290
pcs plus pcs plus I think the pcs plus
his power colored Super Plus power color
special pen
however color sexy sexy plus whatever it
is that's sexy I think will go a sexy so
the power color sexy plus radeon r9 290
now right Kyle what is it about this r9
290 that makes it special unique are
different from other r9 290 s I'm glad
you asked that Paul I have just the
answer but first I kind of wanted to
speculate as to why this is even an
article being brought up in the first
place on
hexxus I believe I got this on hexxus
essentially AMD's trying to target that
sweet spot between the gtx 960 and the
gtx 970 okay
I think what the article was kind of
alluding to was that nvidia has been
under a lot of scrutiny lately with
their arson with her with her r70 with
their GTX 970 with the whole frame
buffer thing the whole issue for gig
versus three-and-a-half gig okay of
course there was a huge huge fire over
that as well as the GTX 960 just not
really meeting up living up to many
people's expectations as far as not not
being a huge performance over the last
generation predecessor so I guess AMD is
trying to capitalize on it with this
particular card and it's supposed to
meet those those kind of sweet spot
requirements between the two as far as
price to performance goes so just a
little bit about the card it's it's a
retailing for about 280 I saw it on 280
at 284 for refer that price on Newegg
that's a good forty fifty bucks less
than a than a nine sensitivity right at
retail yes and it's quite a bit more
than the 210 dollar price tag of the GTX
960 but performance is just through the
roof comparatively speaking and and they
were able to hit performance pretty much
on par with an overclocked GTX 970 okay
so that was really good
now not just to stock nine seventy
seventy over class names overclocked 970
beautiful big differentiation so that's
really cool four gigs of VRAM which
everyone's gonna be happy about
especially you know again given the
whole 970 debacle four gigs for full
gigs a video RAM that it'll be able to
pull from it's a two and a half slot
cooler so it's it's pre beefy it spans
the entire 290 millimeter length of the
card so but you know how like some PCBs
kind of extend over the cooler
yeah and vice versa this is the actual
full length it's a two and a half slot
cooler it has five thicker heat pipes
didn't say how wide the the heat pipes
were I'm guessing there it has a
backplate probably eight millimeters yes
it has a metallic backplate the cooler
is made of plastic but pretty nice
backplate reference specs of the r9 and
that's kind of interesting too because I
think how much was the r9 290x when it
when it first retailed about a year it
goes like 500 bucks it's you 90 X minute
launch plus 550 right so this is this is
scaling back quite a bit
prices have dropped dramatically which
is nice to see and it's just it's a
beast of a card in terms of factory
overclocking it still uses an 8 + 6 pin
PCI connector and they've even added
some glue to the VRMs to mitigate what
is it what's it called oil wine oil wine
yes
I hate colour coil wine it is the worst
ever exist + criminal he probably will
block and that's that's pretty much it
so I don't wanna ramble on too much more
about about this card but it is quite
compelling giving me the benchmarks that
hexxus was able to run Andy has proven
that in the absence of actual new
silicon or new GPU architecture that
they are quite adept at taking their
existing hardware juicing it a little
bit usually with some type of custom a
cooling solution and then rebadging it
as a new card
now there's another debate to get into
over that practice as a whole however if
it helps them stay competitive with
NVIDIA I think it's a good thing and
definitely a 290 is a really good price
to performance card from the get-go so
taking one and having it overclocked out
of the box and having a better cooling
solution I think is a win yes oh yeah is
this out now I didn't catch that
yeah you can buy it's available yeah ok
cool everyone go buy one it was sold out
on new ink already but I think you can
still buy it on Amazon really using my
pulse affiliate link yes yes either of
ours or a boat with them by - yes
crossfire right to leave everything on
Amazon I use alright so moving on with
the other segment my next piece of what
is the segment called again we need to
hammer this home hot heavy hardware I
hope that too much that was good that
was very enthusiastic now we need some
good graphics to throw up there so we
have an SSD yes we do an SSD news
crucial MX 200 successor to the ever
popular MX 111 I really liked the MX 182
there they're always like it's like such
good bang for the buck yeah terms of SS
do you say the three stuff so basically
you're looking at three different models
250 500 and one terabyte models ok
and you'll notice
that's with the MX 100 they they were
actually a little slightly higher
capacity with 256 512 and a little bit
higher than a single terabyte and that's
due to this new caching technology that
they've implemented called dynamic right
allocation which can essentially use
spare NAND in performance single bit
Purcell SLC mode rather than the usual
two bits per cell mlc okay so that's so
that's why it kind of cuts into the
capacity and that's why they're slightly
less fewer gigs on each of the drives
respectively but the end result is is
theoretically faster throughput yeah
that's something you see pretty
frequently with with SSDs is using part
of the NAND itself but using a mlc bit
or a cell as a st. SNS LC cell has
gained more popularity I know Samsung
also does that with the the Evo yeah and
it's pretty effective yeah um so that's
that's a cool way of doing things and
I'm just I'm just happy for affordable
SSDs and that's what the MX 100 was
really all about was giving you 90-95
performance of 95% performance of the
highest end SSDs you're coming in at a
much lower price right and yeah 500 gig
SSDs or even Tara I don't have a
terabyte that's it's not but I'm so
happy about them yeah and this is good
so this should hopefully drive also
maybe the prices of other SSDs down even
further as well yeah absolutely I think
that it's also saying something that
they're not even making they're not even
bothering with 128 gigabyte model now no
price has gone down so dramatically
actually I was going through my old SSDs
cuz my wife's old computer that's handed
down to her dad had a ocz vertex to that
failed and I had to find a replacement I
was like oh I need to find a replacement
and I have a couple to 250s around but
those are more useful for me yeah so I
was looking there and I have like a
couple like 30 gig SSDs and 60 GB SSDs
and like they have nothing to do with
these they're they're good they are good
for Intel Smart Response technology
rather that I will say so yeah so
there's nothing that's don't don't just
toss away your old SSDs even if they're
low capacity
right or you know what even if you don't
have Intel Smart Response you could also
use it just for a cast drive for like
premiere oh yeah that's what I you use
my 64 gig crucial a.m. for forced oh
yeah just have another drive free SSD on
there yeah that's that's another good
solution for it
yeah people all right alright moving on
to the next one this is the last one in
the list for a hot and heavy hardware
drive their homes now for every two good
products that I talked about in this
segment I got to talk about one that
sucks so this is the Mad Catz surf our
surfer surf bar should I become a seen
it and no I shouldn't okay don't do it
but I thought this was kind of silly
it's a gaming controller for Android
consoles and mobile devices with a
built-in QWERTY keyboard which kind of
sounds cool in conception but I think
the review that scene that was saying is
that the joystick there's a choices on
each side that's too small to really
game effectively if you have average or
larger sized hands that is a very small
choice but if you take a look you'll see
that like the ax and and B buttons are
directly circled around the joystick
okay so it actually saves space on the
controller which I thought was kind of
innovative that's interesting and it
might even allow you to hit them a bit
quicker because they're all equidistant
away from the joystick and it's gonna be
650 pounds 67 bucks about 60 67 dollars
u.s. yeah Wow the conversion rate has
really it's going it's the gap it used
to be 60 pounds was at least like
thousand thousand dollars that's pretty
cool I mean I like but Android
I don't gain much on Android so again
neither do I neither do i and the reason
why I even consider this in the first
place is using it for an article is
because I imagine the possibility of
using it for an HTP see ah yes that
would be kind of cool so it's just the
windows and it just is like a USB nub
that sticks and then yeah I think it
didn't say if it was radiofrequency or
bluetooth but it's a good question but
yeah I mean if it was for an HP PC at 67
bucks I would I would definitely
consider it yes especially because I
like the key layout I like how the keys
are kind of spaced out like there's like
a millimeter or two of spacing between
them which probably leads to less
frequent typos
nice to have a tiny little wireless
keyboard for furniture CPC definitely
absolutely definitely and for sure and
that concludes hot and heavy heart all
right beautiful
yeah oh that's right so great job Cal
yeah we should do it without taking our
clothes off okay all right so the next
segment is also a new one that I kind of
thought oh wait before we go into the
next segment quick plug at the end of
this video or towards the end of the
show or at the part two of the show
we're gonna do some Q&amp;amp;A so sweet sweet
some questions to us at our Twitter
handles which are down here below I'm
also kind of trying to monitor the chat
and grab a few questions out of there as
well at the same time but yeah we're
gonna take some questions at the very
end oh thanks okay good boy good boy
Paul all right so this this next one is
called Builder rig and you guys may have
seen this done on other YouTube channels
I know Logan was doing this for a while
where he would he would upload a video
no one's ever done this before was
completely original and unique but I
have a dream once that Logan did a video
on it where he basically takes a use
case scenario PC and basically just
picks out the parts for it he doesn't
actually physically gather them together
and build it but he'll he'll like go on
websites and and pick out parts for it
whatever it may be
so today's today's segment revolves
around a $400 gaming PC so I thought
that was a pretty good $400 $400 not
including operating system
I have no precedent for this I didn't I
didn't look at any of this stuff oh
that's not seen anything I just kind of
threw this together and this is the best
I could find
for a lack of time and they can do too
tight constraints I just kind of went to
Newegg you can maybe find some parts
cheaper elsewhere but I managed to get
it right at 390 $9.94 I was very proud
of myself that is very let you're using
up almost all of your money that I know
I know that's the point
so I'm sure there's a price case right
99 94 so I'm just gonna go down the line
actually I'm gonna start with the CPU
and move on to the other components but
the CPU of choice that I went with was
the the G 30 what is it 32 58 yeah 32:58
1350 a very popular processor in this
price range which is kind of
unprecedented for Intel it's a dual-core
3.2 gigahertz but it's unlocked so you
can overclock it which is awesome
and it's $70 so I thought this was kind
of a unique very niche type of CPU that
would work well in something like this
and because when I think gaming PC I
think overclockable this is exactly the
CPU that I was talking about this is
also the 2020 20 year 20 year
anniversary celebration University
position so super cool I was really
excited to put this in the list and the
motherboard of choice would be the
Biostar h8 181 n hv 3 so 1150 socket of
course 30 40 bucks 40 bucks for an 1150
LGA 881 of course so it's it's obviously
not z97 or anything like upsets cut
down a little bit yes but then a micro
ATX you don't have quite as much space
anyway right 40 bucks per motherboard
and and I also did check I did factor in
like user reviews just too so if I saw
something that got one egg even though
it might have been cheaper I still opted
for the better better reviewed product
is very important and then additionally
memory I went with Myshkin Myshkin
offers really decent performance for the
price I always feel like they're they're
like kind of like crucial in that way
memory goes I'm not keeping up I'm
reading reviews on that motherboard okay
second wishes so we got a Myshkin now
2gig or a 2x4 gig kit yeah
eight gigs pretty standard at 1600 not
too shabby
SSD was the 240 gig PNY optima just 90
bucks SATA 3 synchronous mode I was
actually surprised to find that that's
pretty nice
yeah and then as far as video cards now
this is gonna be like the people who
will either be like yeah good choice
Kyle or people would be like no you
should have cut resources elsewhere and
saved more money for a better card I
went with the 250x know keep in mind
$400 gaming PC yeah and I wanted to make
I wanted to get a processor that was
overclockable at least dual-core so this
is the video card that I was able to
come up with it's a hundred dollar card
and the reviews were actually quite good
I don't know if I found the reviews on
Newegg or elsewhere but I checked the
benchmarks and I was like okay if you're
playing at 1080 even if you play some
triple-a titles maybe bump it down
medium or low and you can still get a
pretty decent game
means people were relatively happy with
the card XFX is a pretty well-known
brand and that's that's just what I went
with
2 gigs 2 gig frame buffer 128 gig bus so
you know great for 1080 madam post
128-bit obviously you can't max anything
out but you can't expect that from a 400
dollar system and then lastly Intel
stock cooler by the way I didn't add an
aftermarket cooler to keep cost down and
lastly the case I went I feel like the
the case in some regards is one of those
components that you can really cut
corners with if you're trying to be on a
budget
yes so this one includes a 300 watt
power supply and another one of those
things where it's like I have really had
to find something to sacrifice in order
to get all the other great hardware
that's in there 40 bucks on the case and
the power supply and the power supply I
was really really pinching pennies at
this point yeah but I don't know it has
52 reviews for four eggs I mean when in
doubt look at the eggs sure every every
case scenario is different but um I felt
like this this might be okay for this
power for this is a 300 watt power
supply is probably gonna be fine
oh for sure I added that up okay granted
I mean that is that is gonna be like you
know number one or near number one on
your on your upgrade list getting that
power supply out of there for sure but
nice to get all that stuff and a 240 gig
SSD for for 400 bucks that's pretty nice
good job Kyle thank you um I'm curious
because I know there's there's lots of
alternatives and what they did you 32:58
i've had like at first Dez really happy
about it but then it like of course it
came out in the same year that like
quad-core started becoming actually
somewhat important for for for gaming I
mean granted there's still tons of games
that aren't optimized for quad-core at
all at all but battlefield 4 is a big
one that's out there for K 4 so that's
why the G 32 58 option has been one
that's been like a little bit more
hesitant to offer but if you're not
playing high-end games and if you're
building $4 computer you're not gonna be
playing you know you're not building
this to play battlefield for the America
for it and max resin then it's a great
choice and I'm curious what the AMD
alternative to this
in the future we should do this one and
we'll have like we'll have a battle with
it new fiber brushes water sits blue or
something like that because with AMD for
roughly the same price for motherboard
and processor you can get a quad core
yeah and I true completely blanking on
which skew of CPU I'm thinking of I
think it's an AM 3 plus not a not an FM
2 plus but anyway but nice there's a
$400 computers that you guys should all
go buy I don't you guys also let me know
let me know what you guys think of the
computer I know you guys have probably
already come and just missed it in the
chat but yeah we got some good comments
some people were impressed but yeah I
mean I think the the SSD in there like
this would be a great computer for like
even take that video card out and for 3
million dollars yeah this is a great
simple basic little computer for anyone
who just needs some c4 like you know a
cheap is here
parents or grandparents or something you
know if you're not gonna be gaming that
G 32:58 has an integrated graphics too
that is right and you'd be all set for
that so so I think I was like I think
next week my build every segment should
be a $300 grandparent PC and I'll remove
the 250 X okay all right and third
segment moving on here we've got another
round of face-off return of your classic
where Paul and I return to the classic
where Paul and I go head-to-head in a
crappy two-player game online and and
then something bad happens to the loser
oh did you choose I haven't I haven't
taken a bad thing down there I know I
didn't have time I was just I couldn't
think of anything bad enough cuz so far
in the last two episodes you've lost so
I was trying to think of something
really bad this time did I lose both I
lost you did my sister lost slime
volleyball and you lost a pacman that's
cuz both of those games you had gone in
and practice extensive I did knocks
forehand well and tonight my mole
veteran alright well if we're gonna be
playing some
QWOP we're playing around I better get
in game ready
I've have a Lagunitas stout here who
delicious
in case you're wondering my I'm drinking
stone enjoy bye this is like one of
their branding things where it's like
let's make it as fresh as possible and
force people to drink it by a certain
date to get the fullest freshest
experience this is enjoyed by February
14th so this is actually like almost a
month old it's like two months two weeks
old you support Cheers
all right so we're gonna play some QWOP
guys let us know in the the chat right
now right now what the loser has to do
nothing bolder uh yeah we need some
acute suggestions in chat for what I
it's hard to think up something like
that on the spot cuz it's got to be like
what like a bad I like a commitment it's
gonna be bad enough for it to be a
legitimate consequence there's a fine
line with punishment yeah I love life
while we're waiting for you guys to
shower us with your fantastic ideas for
the consequence I'm also going to
mention that this week we're using a
webcam to broadcast which is why we
haven't gone had gotten to go over there
and switch off the camera at all or
switch it back on from turning off right
we do have a new camera that we're gonna
start to use next week it hasn't arrived
yet and hopefully that one will solve
all of our problems the webcams doing a
great job so far that's probably just
not quite as as sharp as as the DSLR is
worth all right so we've got some insane
suggestions what do I really like shave
shave their face shave their face we
have to shave our face no what do you
mean no if if I hadn't branded this then
yes we could have but this is like
Howard how are people going to you're
you're a man it'll grow back by your
next video how will people buy you're a
hairy white man these are inside out
don't be a baby
that's how I will look twelve neither of
those are my shirts I was trying to do a
shameless product placement of my shirts
which I conveniently placed there but
those are just normal shirts without my
little assignment all right so wait what
no we're not shaving I know that was a
great idea
okay other ones include
someone gets to drink someone else's
beer that wouldn't work for me because I
have to drive home
yeah Cal's got a pair I would tell Cal's
a DD for today start next week nice and
easy stream drunk like we already
halfway do that sort of what we should
just play the game
people hate cam I have to make videos
tomorrow I can't no one will notice
everyone will know I would see if
something like it's just something like
a shave something that's gonna have a
lasting effect like I'm not opposed to
that but you can't spring it on me I
have to be mentally prepared oh I have
to you were so inflexible
I know exactly that's how I get out of
things all the time not a geek said hey
if you lose the soul patch your channels
doomed that's that is true
all right so co-op is a kewpie no I I'm
I'm gonna be O and B you O and B which
is the ABS and you're gonna be the sighs
oh oh no no I thought I was gonna say oh
is it just you do like three runs and
will record your best score and then
I'll do three you guys I've never played
this before it doesn't matter you know
it seemed I played it a million times I
have no idea how it works
no idea all right it's just there's no
real mechanic to it no I'm sure a lot of
you at home will be like yeah there's me
physics-based
it's a physics based shooter you without
guns track with the runners all right
buttons to control their legs
all right let's let's do it okay you're
gonna tomato wait oh I'm starting yes
take control
ideally you around a hundred meters
mm-hmm Mr D all right point three there
we go point three I'm recording this why
Oh point three why did I die press space
to reschedule no I like what I get three
shots at this yeah and are we doing
cumulative
or just the the longest single run we
really thought this out didn't you let's
do let's do cumulative cumulative
because that's what I planned initially
exactly okay so you have 0.3 Wow I got
one point through there once kept like I
I'm I think he hyper-extended you like
quadrupled your score something that
means predict you to mention I have this
so the next round I should make the full
thousand meters that's right is that
even possible in this game some I bet
there's YouTube videos of people just
running fascinating all right
there's no way this game you I don't
need your score because it was so bad
feel like I need to double check what
Kyle's planning for for face-off if you
got one point maybe a bet it at one time
for let's see I got three point two and
one point something one point three so
I'm a so you got like one point eight
yes calculate it won't matter and Paul
this is Kyle just quietly like they're
doing backflips to say nothing of the
fact that you have me here to start it
for you or as I had to use my hand all
right let's do this
ready go there we go you're starting up
oh here we go
watch this I'm gonna beat your best it's
all about backwards that's the part of
the plan and it's like you well I did
not know that you could just juggle
along on your knees no you should have
researched this god I knew it would
happen I've already beat you first run
two meters
all right Kyle wins let me just fall
over net but I need to small over this
is because if I don't you step back up
though you could still go backwards Oh
could still you have clearly played on
us no I have it much more than I have it
I'm just I'm just naturally good at
GameXplain
this is this is just the type of thing
that comes naturally to a pro my god let
me go let me go seven freaking meters
dude bummer that is actually the best
I've ever done in this game believe it
or not I usually do what you do I'm
gonna go not rightfully so Paul will
shave his soul patch yeah
tomorrow exactly that was agreed upon or
or Kyle needs to draw one thing on your
forehead okay
the forehead drawing thing can be done
when you're doing behalf because I'd be
cool with it for the rest of you on my
segment but with no explanation for my
half of the show I don't think that's
the best way yeah all right well we'll
figure it out we'll report back to you
guys and let you know what all
punishment was okay I will she has a
nerf gun it'll be fun I'm nerf gun yeah
first as I said earth gun something's
like a throw rocks at you okay that was
a fun that was a fun around I'm glad we
played co-op all right and now let's go
into a more serious note with some news
some tech news and a little bit of stuff
from GDC that's going on right now as
well as one more Hardware type story
because I couldn't fit it all in in hot
and heavy hardware and then we'll finish
it off as his face couldn't fit all that
hot and heavy Articuno in he tried yeah
I know just couldn't all right this
first one I found is about valve and
they announced their steam link and
source 2 engine yeah steam link is
actually a product and this day
announced this at GDC it's a new product
from valve that's been designed to
extend a user's stream experience it's
that where that was supposed to go
please to to any room in their house
basically bye-bye excuse me by screaming
steam content from any PC across the
same local home home network so what I
think of this is it's kind of like it
just connects to your TV via HDMI and
it's a stream box and you can stream all
of your games from your PC to whatever
TV in your house is that is that the
impression you got yes it's a $50
streaming device so but it's designed
specifically to work with steam yeah and
which is also pretty cool because
because right now I can stream any steam
game from from my my personal desktop
computer to my my TV in my living room
because I have an HTP C hooked up to it
but in do that of having an HTP see you
could just get a steam link for 50
whatever to hold on okay I'll hold on
breaking news okay
steam link has been cancelled what I
know I'm just kidding
Jesus I'm kidding I'm assuming that
because steam link which used to be a
link to the steam store where you could
buy it
Oh different steam link not there
anymore the link to steam link is that
that's where you know this look yeah I
clicked on this one earlier and it
linked to the actual product page on
okay so steam link is still for sure but
steam link link has been cancelled the
steam link link to seemly is no longer
alright cool so some other information
about it it does support steam machines
wow that's surprising Linux pcs Windows
PCs and Mac's at 20 I'm sorry at 20 at
1080p 60 Hertz beautiful with low
latency I think that's really nice
it will retail for $50 in the US and
will be also be available with the steam
controller for an additional $50 so 50
bucks more for the controller yeah yeah
that seems a bit so that's a little know
maybe it's just got some really I mean
that the Xbox controller was 40 bucks
for your controller if it's okay if it's
if it's I I don't know I was just I'm in
the PC mentality where things should be
cheaper I guess a little right no yep so
50 bucks seems a lot but I guess when
you compare it if it's really well made
but thing and if it's one of those types
of controllers that just last
right for reggae didn't know that kind
of stuff then then maybe that's more
worth it true and then and I also have
to ask you I wonder if you can use any
other controllers with it I would think
so right like if you can use others like
an Xbox 360 controller or PC right so
that's a good question I'll be
interested streaming device friends who
knows I mean it might be running some
like little little basic like Linux
based thing in there that it runs in
order to accept the stream and display
it on the screen in which case it might
not just allow you to plug and play and
a USB device right I'm not sure though I
mean that's so TBD on that but very
interesting nonetheless and the source 2
engine successful to the original source
engine which is very known for creating
games like counter-strike in half-life 2
and half-life 3 to be determined
confirmed but that's that's cool it's
designed for both professional
developers as well as gamers who who
might be developed interested in
developing their own games in the future
and I think it's going to be made free
for content developers so open source
pretty much that's cool yeah sweet
that's that's all I have for that
article the next one is EVGA announcing
their gtx 960 with 4 gigs of ram so for
a buffer or gigs yeah it's impossible
board legit gigs that's weird that
that's where that this 960 will have
more Center man and the 970 is gonna
have more memory than that yeah that's
so obviously this isn't only two things
like higher texture quality's better 4k
resolution gaming performance and things
like that they're also claiming that the
coolers new memory mosfet mosfet cooling
plate will cool the MOSFETs on the card
about 11 degrees celsius cooler than
their their current a CX 2.0 cooler so
this is actually going to ship with
their a CX 2.0 plus there's a lot of
pluses going around the video it's a
great way to improve a product so you
add a plus makes it better it's all
around improves cooling thermal
dissipation that's Rob
I wanna do a shout out to fractal Josh
because he just joined chat Hey if
nothing else to say that yes Josh we
plugged you talk that you're doing with
with with by the week yeah we did
tomorrow
that was the first thing we said so
we're getting like front page anyone
anyone who goes and views that stream
it's probably sent by us
yes or just wants to see you guys
talking about stuff I feel like I was
going somewhere else with that but more
shoutouts other people in chat because
we have some some some longtime regulars
here and I like to give you guys props
reviews by Gary is here I am apropos a
case propose I'm a purpose is also here
welcome thank you for joining us Strider
of course is always straight and a geek
Strider and rooster was a traitor and
rooster had in sergeant ballistic were
sprung we sprung mod duties on them last
week and they're back again even though
we have not asked them to don't even
know we're there sticks in here what's
up Brandi though Kitty's not here your
kitty
and yeah especially since in about a
half an hour or so not that any of you
should be aware of this
Nvidia starting an event but art is is
way better now you don't have anything
to talk about that's important after
this all right Kyle you have any more
stories on your stories last story of my
segment totally switching gears here
from Peter DIY PC tech is this story
that I found on a big-ass black hole
that was discovered in the early
universe
okay so right right after the Big Bang
happened about 875 million years after
that occurred this big-ass black hole
was created it's a super super massive
so this is the church right that is the
big red one that's the big right and
look at the chart I'd assume this is
your story about the biggest I'd assume
that's the one all right
are you no one would ever do a story on
the little green one are you even gonna
talk about the Eddington limit no are
you yes okay you can fill me
Eddington limit because this was the
last story obviously this was the last
story that Isles filler story no no I
was in your kitchen story and you're
like are you ready to go live
and I'm like last night and I saw
heading she's limit now I was like oh
hell no really I'm not gonna about to
figure out this new new terminology okay
space I will briefly explain from the
like two seconds I spent reading this
story what the Eddington limit is so
when a black hole okay it gets to a
certain size right what we've what we've
learned about black holes more recently
not gonna be very specific here because
I'm at any research is that it used to
be thought that everything that goes in
that passes the event horizon on a black
hole gets sucked into the center and
it's gone forever and that was
consumption that was it that was a
quandary for astrophysicists because
that exhibits a lot of information which
is against one of the basic laws of
physics right I'm pologize to any
physicists if I'm terribly off here so
there is actually a halo around black
holes where light escapes right assuming
that so what the Eddington limit is is
that as a black hole gets bigger and
bigger and the rate of acceleration of
mass getting pulled into it increases
the amount of light that has to be given
off on the outside also increases
relatively to that because more stuff
getting pulled in means more stuff has
to come out however the light coming out
and this is where it gets a little weird
actually has a gravitation like I don't
want to say gravitational pull actually
has an effect on the stuff going in as
well okay so you can only get it to a
certain size before the stuff being
pulled in and the stuff being pulled out
can't equalize that's what's known as
the Eddington limit and that is what is
theoretically at least at this point the
largest size of the black hole can ever
get and this black hole is doesn't have
something to do as lamination like some
is the radiation is the radiation of
light or the halo at the edges right now
it might be something other than just
light the constriction after a certain
point yeah okay so that's that's my
really basic understanding and then
there might be some errors in there but
okay well yeah but obviously that very
very much ties in with this article
because the the supermassive black hole
that we're talking about here is pretty
much as big as we've seen it in the past
so it's not unprecedented we've seen
other supermassive black holes this big
but what's interesting about it is that
it's about twelve point eight billion
light years away from Earth which means
you know you can measure the the age of
something in space based on how many
light-years away it is based on the
speed of light right so basically it was
it was formed 875 million years after
the Big Bang which is only about 6% of
the universe's life when compared to its
13.8 billion billion light year age so
so it's like it's like a baby
it's like a it's like the grand it's
like a great-great-grandfather so it's a
really cool it's a really old black hole
really little black hole is there any
way you can somehow tie that into like a
mild insult against Josh or something I
can't no not on the stream well yeah
sorry I don't quite have that level of
wit right exactly
so that's big-ass black hole story right
so pretty cool stuff I don't want to I
don't want to drag on about black hole
stuff there's Josh's in the chat no no
they don't have atrocities he'll come up
with next sir is this the end of your
size this concludes side a of a side a
of my segment so be sure to stay tuned
for Paul segment yes coming up right now
and if you guys are watching this go
ahead and a archive eject that tape
ejects was idler flipped over then you
get side by side be on Paul's channel
Paul's hardware also feel free to buy a
shirt from the awesomesauce merch store
and link links in the description as
well as a pulse hardware shirt from the
the pulse hardware net store yes yeah if
you're watching live we're gonna cut for
just a moment and then we will be right
back with side B that's right thanks for
watching see you in just a moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
