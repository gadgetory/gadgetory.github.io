like I do and I came across this little
cooler here the Arctic freezer 33 TR
which is intended for risin thread
Ripper CPUs
it's a dinky little cooler it's only $45
it has a single 120 millimeter fan and a
single small heatsink tower and I'm
looking at this thing going hop how is
this little cooler are gonna cool
a monstrous CPU like in 1950 X which is
180 watt TDP chip apparently the max TDP
that this is rated for is 200 watts so I
don't know I just had to buy it and test
it out today and I think it's pretty
relevant because second gen thread
Ripper is right around the corner I
think more people are gonna be looking
into maybe low cost or here air-cooled
solutions for those chips and they're
probably gonna wonder if this is any
good so it's also interesting because
the reviews on this are pretty positive
on Amazon four to five stars 55 reviews
but upon further inspection you'll
notice that most of those reviews are
talking not about the freezer 33 TR
model but the eSports one which is
similar to this one but is only intended
for mainstream
Intel and horizon sockets so out of
those 55 reviews maybe only four or five
of those are talking about this
particular model being used with a
thread Ripper CPU because this cooler
also supports a m4 and out of those four
or five reviews it's pretty much split
down the middle half of them are saying
yeah this cooler does what it is
intended for it's getting the job done
the other half are saying the complete
opposite so we're gonna get to the
bottom of it today it should be pretty
interesting to see which way it falls
we're gonna be testing it along the 1950
X of course with an asus rog zenith
extreme the last time i use this board
it didn't work
i'm not exactly sure what postcode area
was giving us can't remember but maybe
we can fix it with a bios flashback or
something like that we have a gtx 1070
founders edition a gigabyte extreme 1200
watt power supply we'll probably be
using some configuration of g.skill
transy memory but yeah with that said
let's go ahead and put our little test
bed together man my fingers are awesome
hey how about a beer okay let's change
scenes before this gets old
the Thermaltake tuff power grand RGB
power supplies ship 80 plus gold rated
with a fully modular design zero rpm
mode and a quiet RGB fan that syncs with
compatible motherboards and devices take
your power delivery to the next level
with the tough power grant series you
can click the link below for more info
all right so really quick sorry for the
crappy built-in audio of my blog camera
here it's just the easiest way for me to
show you what's happening right now so
the zenith board is still giving me
issues I just flashed the BIOS and we
are now getting a different code its
code 70 and it says updating ec1 code
alright and that actually spits out this
screen bios is updating do not shut down
Beliveau voix and it's been like this
for about half an hour I've actually
tried this several times over I tried
clearing the CMOS again you know cutting
the power supply power and do it doing
all the basic troubleshooting steps and
still we're stuck at this screen so I'm
gonna show up this board for now and
actually head to Micro Center before
they close to pick up a different X 399
board because this is really the only x
399 board that I have on hand at the
moment that's free the only other one
that I have is actually at home in my
workstation computer there so yeah let's
head to micro Center and get a different
board so we can get this video movie oh
hey look at that
it's an ass rock x3 99 Tai Chi and just
like that this video got $400 more
expensive you guys should really
consider buying some merch alright we
are finally in the desktop and it feels
oh so good
I have Rison master open here as well as
hardware monitor just so we can verify
that we are getting the correct
temperature readings and it's looking
like they're lining up here we're
getting around 40 ish in the 40s range
so it's not the greatest idol temps I've
ever seen but it's not terrible either
it definitely gives us the green light
to go ahead and put a load on her
giggity alright so this is a thread
Ripper test after all so I'm gonna start
off by rendering out a 4k file in Adobe
Premiere Pro actually we're using media
encoder to do our rendering I've got
rising master right here you can see the
temperature and yeah we're actually
giving this cooler the benefit of the
doubt by having it on an open air test
bed I would reckon that CPU temps would
be at a disadvantage had we put all this
hardware inside of an enclosed chassis
so I guess it's got that going for it
but let's go ahead and fire this guy up
and see what happens
all right the temps are rising 57 58 you
can see I have not overclock the CPU
it's probably a given we're starting off
with stock frequencies here turbo Eng up
to 3.7 so we are down to the last 20
seconds of our render here and we just
hit 62 C that's our max temperature so
far that I've seen throughout this whole
render so that's actually pretty good I
think after this test I'm gonna go into
the BIOS and do some overclocking
all right we're back in the desktop
overclocked to 4 gigahertz on all 16
cores what do you guys think is gonna
happen when we run the same render test
now let's find out
Wow immediately spiked up to 58 59 and
we're pretty much where we were after a
good two to three minutes for the first
render so we're definitely warmer we've
already passed the 60 to see mark and
climbing I think we're just about to hit
70 see I can feel it ooh okay so 70 see
and we're about halfway through our
render now a little over halfway done
I'm actually really impressed with this
cooler I mean even in a case I think
this cooler would be pretty adequate
it's looking like it could do the job
especially I mean obviously you're gonna
need a case that has healthy airflow
going through it you don't want to put
this in like a you know a suffocated
case with poor front intake or something
like that but if you have a well
ventilated chassis you can probably
achieve very close to these temperatures
the other nice thing is that the coolers
fan is really quiet I mean I can
definitely hear it from two three feet
away but I mean this test build isn't
even in a case so stick it inside of a
chassis with all the other fan noise
it's gonna get drowned out completely
and a retro test is done just like that
I guess I could put a gaming load on
here but I don't really see the point
honestly most people buying thread
ripper are using it for workstation
applications like Adobe Premiere Pro and
geez this is this cooler surprisingly to
my surprise anyway passed with flying
colors so I think our work here is
pretty much done let's close this up
with some final words I don't know guys
I'm still kind of scratching my head
over this thing I just it's hard to
believe that a $45.00 very basic looking
air cooler can handle all the heat
coming off of a 16 core overclocked
high-end desktop CPU maybe all of you
saw this coming and I'm the only one who
didn't but it just seems pretty
impressive and surprising to me and the
other thing is that we're here at the
office long after operating hours
they've shut the they shut the AC off
like 3-4 hours ago and it's gone from 68
Fahrenheit to 77 so and that was the
temperature that this was tested in
normally all my tests are done during
work hours for the most part at around
68 69 C or Fahrenheit but not this one
and still it was able to pump out some
pretty decent performance all things
considered the other thing is that the
quality of the cooler I didn't speak
much about the cooler itself the quality
is actually pretty good fan and heatsink
seemed seem well built the mounting
mechanism is smart and and very simple
straightforward without much fuss the
brackets though that the little dinky
metal brackets that mount the fan to the
heatsink are pretty weak and if you use
them a couple times they start to wear
out and get a little loose but apart
from that pretty pretty decent stuff
here guys we might be sitting on a
hidden gem that I kind of just helped
not be so hidden perhaps you guys let me
know though if you have any experience
with the freezer 33t are cooling a
thread Ripper CPU let me know how it
went in the comments I'm very curious to
hear your feedback every users
experience is different so you might
have tried the same thing here that I
did today and it sucked but let us know
in the comments that's the only way we
can really get a better idea of how this
thing performs as a whole so that's all
I got for now guys thanks so much for
tuning in
toss like on the video if you enjoyed it
and get subscribed for more tech
videos coming at you really soon you can
also check me out on floatplane for 3
bucks a month if you want to watch all
my videos a week early without ads I'll
put a link for that in the video
description as always thank you guys so
much for tuning in have a good one and
I'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
