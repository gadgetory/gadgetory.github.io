channel hope you're all doing well we
have a very special surprise in store
for you today because wifey sauce and I
will be building a system together yeah
why is that special well it's it's
special because we haven't really quite
built a system together like this
I'd say enough for this is horrible
the MSI B 360 gaming Pro carbon delivers
best-in-class performance with core
boost technology for higher clock speeds
a dual power heatsink to improve
thermals and audio boost for with the
latest majimak software gamin style with
mystic light and sync supporting RGB and
rainbow LED strips while controlling
millions of colors in a single click to
learn more about the B 360 gaming Pro
carbon click the link in the description
okay so as you guys might have guessed
today we'll be building a PC inside of
the same shirt which essentially means
that I'm gonna be limited to using only
my left hand for this build wife√≠s
austenite only with her right there's a
couple really quick and simple rules to
this build today for one we'll have one
hour to finish the whole thing and
secondly we have to build the system as
if were a single person which means we
only get one screwdriver we can only use
one screwdriver at a time we have to
open a single box at a time we can't you
know I can't be fiddling with something
over here while she's fillings with
something as an independent person so
those are pretty much the rules as you
can see it's already gonna be it's
already getting complicated it's already
weird it's a very simple straightforward
mid-range build it got a Core i5
8400 a nice be 350 gaming Pro carbon
motherboard from MSI and rx 580 this is
a Radeon card of course from power color
we have the CPU that just dropped eight
gigs of Ripjaws v ddr4 at to 3000
megahertz a silicon power 256 gig SSD 2
terabyte WD black a master air g 100m
UFO looking CPU cooler from Coolermaster
that I saw at CES looks coming through
and then we have a 550 watt power supply
from EVGA wrapping things up with a
message fic from Fraggle design thank

tape off great all right okay you take
them out go ahead and lower it I know

memory will probably get in the way we
don't have a box-cutter on the table

gonna cut it with public tighter yeah I
would not be good if we had a box cutter
right it would be easy
no probably cut each other well oh this

terrible way to do it oh yeah that's

it it's in the other room you got to go
really quick come on if we go to D or G
there will be the fan box is right next
to the door so no it's unlocked open it
there should be a fan right on the top
of the box get a 120 let's just get like
here sorry here we go I don't know why
