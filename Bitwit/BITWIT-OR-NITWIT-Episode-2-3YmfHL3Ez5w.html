David how's it going that goes best
something can you confess something sure
a very good feeling about this did you
really yes so you already know what's
about to go down yep you're keeping a
pretty cool composure right now I'm sure
your cheer exploding internally though
yeah all right yeah well cool are you
ready to explode some more Hellion
follow me
all right so David you clearly know who
I am and what I do
so you've also seen this little series
before and you kind of know how this
works
all right so for those of you who are
watching don't know basically this is a
sort of hidden game show I guess it's a
little less hidden when the contestant
knows exactly who you are
but basically David has a chance to win
a full-blown gaming PC which is right
under here now since you've already seen
the pilot I'm presuming yeah you've
probably already seen this system that
clearly the first guy did not win so now
you get a chance to the way that you'll
be able to do this is by answering a
series of five questions correctly this
is multiple choice so you do have that
now remember you do get one lifeline on
all of this and you can use it on any
question you want it basically lets you
choose two answers and as long as one of
those answers is correct
you move on to the next question I'm
good we're really quick really quick
because because you you I clearly
tricked you and to get coming here you
had the idea that you were gonna be
buying a case is that because you were
building a system for yourself or what's
I'm usually looking of great stuff for
my brother and my sister's computers
okay and one of my hands asked me if I
could build a computer for our kids
I thought mutually I'm gonna look out
for parts like trying to get something
together so if you happen to win this
system which by the way features arise
in seven 1800 X and an EVGA GTX 1080p I
for the win three would that also be
going to one of your aunts kids probably
not I'd probably take apart my current
rig and probably just spread that out
which I think it's fair I think that's
totally fair because at the end of the
day you're the one who's answering these
questions true can you tell us what the
current specs are at home 40 60 70 K
poor sir age 100 I cooler EVGA gtx 970
and uh fantex and - looks awesome those
are already some pretty decent specs but
at least in the graphical Department
you're looking at serious upgrade so
let's get started you ready yep question
number uno a 27-inch monitor measures 27
inches in which dimension is at a height
B with C depth or D diagonally d D is
correct you are moving on to question 2
here we go
which cable would you use to power a CPU
is a EPS be ATX C PCI Express or diene
eSATA pretty sure it's a tell your final
answer yes that is correct David
seemed to be blazing through these first
two questions so far what's your just
really quick what's your background in
building pcs not super extensive I built
three before I'm technically in college
for computer information systems but
also been to class in like a year
yeah so I'm a little rusty but I'd like
to keep up where I can alright that
sounds good let's see if you can put
some of your knowledge to the test with
question number three having four intake
fans and two exhaust fans in a computer
case typically results in which of the
following a positive air pressure B
negative air pressure C neutral air
pressure or D
peer pressure okay let's say I know it's
not B or D I'm pretty sure it's not see
so more intake than song I'm gonna go
with a a positive air pressure you are
correct
again getting a little nervous for you
actually I'm not this is crazy you
haven't even used a lifeline yet so
you're in really good shape
well I save question for trips yep at
all NVIDIA began limiting their multi
GPU support to two-way SLI starting with
which GPU architecture a Kepler be
Maxwell C Pascal were deed Turing
who ya need to be following the sort of
the the industry quite a bit to know
this one any initial thoughts stating
that I'm burst gut instinct maybe I'm
I'm pretty sure it's not a or B because
I remember from Jason's video and he was
doing one of his gun ports upgrades that
you're not allowed to mention Jays
defense on my channel sorry that's not
allowed here he was going back and forth
into a 3-way SLI on a bill I'm pretty
sure that was maxwell so it'd have to be
C or deep but I'm not 100% sure which
one so I think I'm gonna use that
lifeline he's using a lifeline you can
choose two answers instead of one and as
long as one of those answers is correct
you move on to the next question
cool I will pick C and D he's going with
C and D Pascal and touring final answer
final answer
well David start getting excited because
you are odds of the last question my
friend you are killing it alright this
is question number 5 for the big one
here we go
which of these protocols maxes out its
bandwidth the transfer speed at 10
gigabits per second is it a USB 3.1 gen
USB 3.1 gen2 C SATA revision 3.0 or D
PCI Express
could use a light plane again same thing
I know it's not C or D that's the
behavior beef okay so we're in that
50/50 state again right yeah okay hi why
do you do this to me do you have a
current system that that has either of
those ports on it only Gen one nothing I
have has Gen 2 and like I know that all
that weirdness was do with me three and
then getting renamed to 3.1 and all that
nonsense right I just remember the
numbers a problem I don't know so I'm
just gonna take a shot I'm gonna go with
final answer
it's gonna have to be David you just
want to freaking gaming to be perfectly
honest but you guessed right I mean it
was more or less a shot in the dark you
would have looked down to those two
answers and you guessed right so
congratulations man thank you so much
