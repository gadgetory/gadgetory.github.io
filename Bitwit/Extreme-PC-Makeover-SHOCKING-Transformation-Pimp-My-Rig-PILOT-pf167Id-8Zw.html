the other day I tweeted out a picture of
my cousin's gaming PC and I told you
guys to raid it one through 10 mainly
because I wanted to see the horrified
look on his face after reading all your
comments and sure enough you guys
delivered on that and like you always do
but the the feedback was actually quite
polarizing half of you commended Andrew
for his part selection after all we have
a fairly high end system here with a
7700 K and a gtx 1070 founders edition
but the other half of you savagely tore
him a new one when it came to aesthetics
which i wholeheartedly understand as I
have several cosmetic quarrels with this
build in its current state including
ungodly dust filled patil nauseating
ketchup and mustard cables I'm seeing a
lot of ketchup and mustard
not many wieners and ugly CPU cooler I'm
sure it works fine but it's ugly boring
stock case fans
how can your fan be running when it's so
name and a lack of RGB no wonder it's
running slow now to be fair this is only
the second system Andrews ever put
together so it could have been a lot
worse but as a close family member of
mine his shoddy building skills reflect
poorly on my own and honestly I drew him
quite offended that you would do this to
your own cousin I guess we'll just call
it even for that one time I got you way
too drunk at Ren Faire so for my own
self-preservation and interest today I
will be pimping out Andrews PC I do have
a small handful of blingy parts I'll be
adding to the system but instead of
showing all them to you at once I'm
gonna introduce and install them one at
a time just to switch things up before I
do any of that however there's one thing
that I absolutely need to do to the
system before we begin and that is of
course give it a good dusting
do not shake I will so now that
we're done dusting we can start adding
some new product to the build such as
this sleeved extension kit from up here
that's the name of the brand I've never
heard of me before leads me to believe
they're a Chinese manufacturer but they
got really good positive feedback on
Amazon a lot of user reviews and stuff
so I'm actually kind of looking forward
to using these because it was a fairly
cheap alternative to the traditional
cable mod and other big-name brands that
we're familiar with so as you can see if
there's a little cut out here I am going
green yes in fact this entire system is
gonna be given a green feed black and
green expose a very tried and true color
scheme the reason I'm going that route
is because we already have green
branding on our founders additional card
that's a little tricky to change or
modify and I don't really want to get
into that for my cousin's PC so we're
gonna do black and green I think it's
gonna be super sexy in the end I can't
wait to see how it turns out so let's
get the stole in this kit and take the
aesthetics of this build up a notch or
two
Keeble slating kit is now installed and
things are already looking a whole lot
better it's amazing what a difference
just that cable kit alone makes but the
next thing I want to do is actually swap
out this eyesore of an air cooler for
something with a little bit more Flair
so here I have the cryo rig h7 quad
movie this is actually a pretty good
performer for the price and you'll
probably be able to hit some higher
overclocks with it then the cooler
that's already in there additionally
it's got RGB lighting it's it's got like
three different RGB zones I believe that
are all supported by cam the NZXT cam
software the last thing I'll say here is
that this is a very attractive cooler
even without the LEDs on you got this
sort of nice flat black faceplate with a
cry or a glow go the fan is stylized and
modern without overdoing it and overall
it's just a very handsome unit that I
think is gonna look lovely inside of
this system so without further ado let's
get it installed
oh yeah I'm diggin it so far it's really
coming along nicely the next thing I
want to do is swap out this stock case
fan it's a 140 millimeter fan perfectly
adequate for cooling and all that but
we're just gonna give it a little bit of
RG bling as we do so this is an AR RGB
140 kit with a hue plus comes with two
140 s however I'm only gonna be giving
Andrew one of these fans cuz I'm using
the other one in a different system so
you can't have it Andrew you only get
one fan but aside from that you don't
really need more than one 140 millimeter
fan for exhaust in this system as it
currently stands
you got three 120 s at the front for
intake already and the graphics card has
a closed shroud which means all the hot
air is being ejected out the back of the
case it's not actually interfering with
CPU temps going through the heatsink or
anything like that so one 140 is gonna
be perfectly adequate now this kit does
not include any LED strips but I do have
some on hand it's just an inventory I'm
gonna be adding those to the mix as well
and finally you guys probably noticed
the expansion card that Andrew popped in
here there's actually four USB three at
the back apparently he needed more USB 3
but it's got this terrible SATA 2 molex
adapter that's ketchup and mustard
through and through and I don't like it
one bit so this is the last little thing
we'll have to change about the system
I'm not exactly sure if I have a similar
cable that's all black or if we have a
spare SATA cable that's connected to the
power supply as of now we'll just have
to see what we can do when we get there
but on that note let's go ahead and wrap
this thing up
hey there it is damn big difference eh
I don't my Canadian anyone can do this I
think that's maybe the more all the
story is just a few quick changes
obviously I did spend a bit of coin but
you can find ways to make it cheaper you
can turn you're just very average
looking system into something that looks
a little bit more showy I would also
suggest that before you pimp out your PC
cosmetically to make sure that the
hardware the specs are where you want
them to be first I would say upgrade
performance first and then once you're
happy with that then you can take a
whack at aesthetics but yeah this is a
lot of fun I hope you guys enjoyed the
video that's all I have to say really go
ahead and hustle like on it if you
enjoyed it you can also get subscribe to
the channel for more tech stuff coming
at you really soon lots of exciting
content on the way and feel free to
check me out on floatplane if you want
to watch my videos a week early without
ads for 3 bucks a month I'll put a link
for that in the video description until
next time guys thank you so much for
watching have a good one and I'll see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
