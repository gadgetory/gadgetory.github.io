new challenge that pushes the limits of
even the most enthused of enthusiasts
you see after teasing several pictures
on my Twitter and Instagram of cables
leaving stuff lying around my house you
guys insisted that an obligatory
sleeving video was in order so today
I'll be sleeping my own cables for my
own personal desktop and I'll be showing
you guys the steps that I took along the
way now before anything else a huge
thanks to mainframe Kustoms for
providing all of the special tools and
sleeving being used in this video if you
guys are into custom sleeping or looking
for a place to get everything you need
to start they are a great resource so
check them out at mainframe custom comm
now for those of you unfamiliar custom
cable sleeping is a hobby and artform
popular among PC enthusiasts that
involves sleeping your cables with a
custom aftermarket sleeve for sheer
cosmetic win typically the sleeve colors
are based around the color scheme of
your system adding a beautiful eye
catching aesthetic to your rig now there
are two basic options when deciding what
kind of cables you'll be sleeping you've
got your full length cables that run
directly from your power supply to your
components or cable extensions which
link your existing power supply cables
to your components acting as a sort of
middleman between the two now since this
is my first rodeo today I'll just be
slaving my cable extensions for my 24
pin ATX motherboard connector and my two
8 pin PCIe connectors for my gtx 780 Ti
I'll save the tutorial for sleeping your
existing power supply cables for another
day now pre sleep cable extensions are
available for purchase from
manufacturers like Silverstone and
BitFenix but you're left with far fewer
color options and virtually no
customizability the quality of the
actual sleeping also takes a huge
backseat when compared to something like
the lute row customs brand of sleeving
that I'll be using today and lastly
before we get started bear in mind that
you will be incurring some additional
cable lengths with these extensions more
so than you would if you were simply
sleeping full length power supply cables
so just make sure that you have enough
room in your case for proper cable
management before going the extension
route all right so to pull all of this
off you're going to need quite a few
tools and supplies some of which you
probably already have lying around the
house and others you might have to buy
at a specialty store like mainframe
Kustoms first thing you'll need is 18
gauge wire how much you need depends on
which cable extensions and how many you
are slaving the wire will most likely
come in one piece on a spool but to save
me some time the mainframe team did me
the solid of pre cutting and pre
crimping all of my wires but don't worry
I'll still be going over all of these
steps in this tutorial next you'll need
the correct number of male and female
ATX connector pins for my single 24 pin
ATX and two 8 pin PCIe extensions I'll
have a total of 40 connection points
meaning I'll need 20 male and 20 female
ATX pins to get the job done to crimp
these pins to the ends of your wires
you'll also need a crimping tool this
one from Lucho Kustoms did a great job
at making perfect crimps every time the
only time it didn't make a perfect crimp
well it was user error next get an
appropriate set of plastic connectors
i've got plugs for my 24 pin ATX and
both of my 8 pin PCIe extensions my
initial intent was to also sleeve a
molex extension for this video but due
to time constraints I had to leave it
behind now in case you secure a wire
into a plastic connector and need to
remove it I'd highly suggest getting an
ATX pin removing tool like this one of
course you can easily MacGyver one with
a staple if you're cheap like me but
having a dedicated tool was super nice
to have on hand also vital to the task
of sliding cables is the actual sleeving
now again I'm using loot row custom zone
teleost line which is a four millimeter
PT sleeving
PT is known for its availability in many
different colors and sizes it's
resistant to UV radiation chemical
degradation and abrasion not to mention
it is incredibly cost effective PT
sleeving also holds its shape very well
which is definitely important for a
clean looking PC another very popular
sleeping option is paracord but it's
typically harder to work with from what
I understand so I stayed far away from
it for this time around
now just as crucial as the sleeves
themselves is heat shrink now you do
have the option to sleeve your cables
with the heat shrink design where the
heat shrink is visible or a heat shrink
less design where it is not either way
you're still going to need it to secure
the sleeving to your wire I'm opting for
a heat shrink less design because I
personally think heat shrink looks
hideous but here I have some quarter
inch pieces that will only end up using
40 of these when all is said and done I
still have more than enough in case I
mess up and need extras and this is
something you guys should consider when
buying your supplies buy more than you
need if you need 15 feet of sleeving by
25 feet if you need 40 ATX pins by 60
you are going to mess up and you are
going to waste some materials especially
if it's your first time sleeping so make
sure that you buy more than the bare
minimum of supplies rounding out the
list of tools that you'll need our fire
in the form of a lighter a ruler with
millimetre measurements a pair of wire
cutters and a good wire stripper the
last two things you'll need are a pair
of high quality scissors unlike these
ones and a razor now that we're finally
ready to start getting our hands dirty
the first thing you want to do is decide
how long you want your extensions to be
based on the hardware layout in your
case and your personal preference now
don't just measure the distance between
the plug on your component and the
nearest routing hole in your case you
definitely want to leave some additional
length so that the extensions connector
is able to lay completely flat behind
your motherboard tray remember a
slightly longer cable is typically more
forgiving than a slightly shorter one
and in case you guys were wondering each
of my wires measures exactly 290
millimeters long to measure the wire
push it right up against the edge of
your ruler so that it's completely
straight then use your razor to make a
slight indent on the wire where you wish
for it to be cut grab your wire cutters
and cut along the razor line next use a
wire stripper to strip off three
millimeters of wire casing on both ends
with your ruler measure three
millimeters from the end of the wire and
mark with a razor starting at your razor
mark strip the three millimeters of wire
casing off and do the same for the other
end now you can proceed to crimping your
ATX pins to the wire you'll notice each
ATX pin has two sets of wings a long
pair and a much shorter pair take a pin
and place it on the inside of the
crimping tool with all the wings facing
inward the loot row customs crimping
tool has a little shelf on the inside
for the longer set of wings to rest on
at this point slowly crimp down the pin
until you hear three distinct clicks and
go no further remove the pin from the
crimping tool and thread one end of the
wire inside so that the very tip reaches
all the way to the end of the smaller
wings then carefully place the wire and
pin back inside the crimping tool in the
same position as it was before and crimp
the pin all the way down if done
correctly you'll see that every copper
wire has been completely crimped down by
the smaller set of wings now go ahead
and prep
second ATX pin for the other end of the
wire remember each wire in your
extension should have one male pin at
one end and a female pin at the other so
again three clicks with the crimping
tool but before you go any further you
want to make sure that the wings of this
second ATX pin are facing the same
direction as the first pin we crimped
failure to do so might prevent your
cables from effectively plugging into
their plastic connectors to do this hold
the crimped end of the wire down on the
table with the wings facing up and
firmly slide your fingers down the cable
to the other end now that you have a
frame of reference of which direction
your wires facing place the second ATX
pin on the wire wings facing up just the
same as the first one and proceed to
crimping it all the way down when you're
finished you'll have yourself a
perfectly crimped wire and can then move
on to sleeving
measure your sleeving by holding the end
of the sleeve up so that it rests
directly between the long and short set
of wings slide it alongside the wire
making sure not to stretch it otherwise
it'll end up being too short then use a
pair of scissors to cut the other end of
the sleeve at the same point right in
between the wings with a nicely cut
piece of sleeving ready take your
lighter and ever so slightly melt both
tips of the sleeve you want the flame to
barely reach the sleeve and when it does
you can feather it down a bit with your
fingers this step dramatically helps to
seal the ends of your sleeves to prevent
fraying now we can move on to the actual
sleeving thread the wire through the
sleeve to the other end if along the way
the wire gets stuck you can help it
along by pinching the sleeve half an
inch in front of your stuck ATX pin and
sliding the sleeve up until you reach
your pin at that point pinch down on the
ATX pin and simply release your other
hand off of the sleeve keep repeating
this motion inching your wire through
the sleeve until it makes its exit next
slide the heat shrink over the ATX pin
so the end of it just slightly overhangs
the end of your sleeve by about two
millimeters hold the heat shrink and
sleeve firmly in place with your fingers
while using your other hand to melt the
end of the heat shrink with a lighter I
tried to use the blue part of the flame
and held it up to the heat shrink for
about six seconds now immediately after
this while things are still hot use the
wire cutters to cut a line down the
excess heat shrink and quickly pull it
off what you'll find is that the heat
shrink has permanently welded the sleeve
to the wire establishing a secure
connection between the two
now if you've done everything correctly
you'll end up with a perfectly sleeved
wire that's ready for plugging into your
plastic
connectors the connectors are keyed
meaning that the ATX pins have to be
facing a certain way in order to latch
into the hole successfully to do this
make sure the wings of the ATX pin are
facing the same direction as the
securing latch on your plastic
connectors during this step you should
also be conscious of which gender of pin
you should be plugging in at all times
get a firm hold of your wire as close to
the pin as you can for maximum security
and slide it in all the way you'll know
you've inserted and connected the wire
correctly when you hear two faint clicks
simultaneously this indicates that the
ATX prongs have successfully latched
onto the internal connector for quality
assurance once the wires in give it a
little tug to make sure it's securely in
place you can also check the terminal
side of the connector to see if all your
ATX pins are level finally as a word of
caution I should warn you guys that it
is extremely important that all of your
wires are going to the right place
between your two connectors one mismatch
could potentially do some serious damage
to your system so be sure to triple
check that your wires are wired
correctly but those are all the steps
involved to create awesome-looking
extensions and as you guys could
probably tell this endeavor is not for
the faint of heart it requires a lot of
time and even more patience than you
might expect after all everything you
just saw me do was just for a single
wire in a pile of 40 while this was
easily one of the most tedious and
time-consuming PC related tasks I've
ever taken on the end results are quite
validating and stunning and having done
it now certainly feels like a rite of
passage of sorts into the PC modding
community
speaking of modding I want to thank
today's sponsor lynda.com that has
nothing to do with modding I know just
I'm not good at transitions why don't
you mod your life
with better learning ok I'm done but
seriously lately a lot of you guys have
been asking me how do I start my own
youtube channel and while much of it
does boil down to trial and error while
I do this unboxing I will be doing it in
my boxers there's an equal amount of
technical skill involved like video
editing motion graphics and web design
lit accom has thousands of tutorials on
topics like these that relate directly
to the YouTube business model so whether
you're trying to start up a tech channel
or trying to build your own website
since YouTube rolled out their new Terms
of Service lynda.com is a great resource

but that is going to wrap it up for this
video guys as always toss me a like if
you found it helpful and let me know
what you think of this whole cable
slaving business whether you'd be up for
the task and wire why not if you have
slaved in the past share your experience
with the rest of us and how that
experience shaped your current view on
custom slaving before you guys go check
