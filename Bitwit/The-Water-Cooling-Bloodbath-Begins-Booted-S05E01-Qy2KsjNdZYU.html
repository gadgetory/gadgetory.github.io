this is season five how's it going no do
not do any I'm not doing a keemstar
intro fuck that guy what's up guys hope
you're all doing well happy 4th of July
for all of you Americans out there and
if you're not American then Oh God I'm
hearing myself talk
this is horrible shut up me I'm so
annoying I hate hearing myself talk okay
what's up and if you're not American
then happy Tuesday it's you know what
it's Monday I'm totally on my game today
a funny story I actually thought I had
about an hour and a half or so till the
show started and then wifey sauce comes
in goes do you want me to help moderate
boot it in like 15 minutes and I was
like what do you mean 15 minutes she was
like well it's like 5:15 right now I
look at my my streaming box time and
date at the bottom right corner of my
screen and it's an hour behind so I
literally almost missed the show
entirely due to the the wrong time ping
set on this on this system so thank God
for her it's the only reason why we're
on time here otherwise it would have
been a whole hashtag blame poll all over
again uh hopefully you guys can hear me
okay no one's ragin or blowing up chat
right now proud to be American oh yeah
all right cool looks like everything's
coming in good which is amazing because
I like I said it was hardly ready for
this episode to go live just about 15 20
minutes ago but it looks like we're okay
Mike's coming through all right I've got
the AC running because it's freaking hot
outside sorry if there's a little bit of
a hum but we're gonna have to deal with
it for now and this is how we're
spending our 4th of July I'm glad that
I'm very honored that on a national
holiday such as this one that you guys
have chosen to watch this episode of
booted
and see this season off this is the
season five custom water-cooled series
or a season the first one of the entire
series I've never done a custom water
cold season before so this should be
pretty exciting again this is all like
no like AIO stuff here this is all
custom builds all custom work and there
was a lot of really good contenders this
season obviously they're for the most
part pretty high in parts in every build
so that's that's also exciting and I
feel like the custom water cooled season
this time around it is gonna be like
mainly focused on in it on aesthetics I
would have to imagine and obviously it's
also up to you guys to determine you
know what kind of factors you're looking
for when you're voting for each of these
contenders here but at the end of the
day custom water cooling you're really
looking to see just how badass it looks
which is which is exciting and some to
some degrees so we're gonna take a look
at that there is no sponsor for this
season of booted
I have no sponsor I didn't bother lining
one up just because there was a lot of
other things going on like just
finishing up Computex a few weeks ago
and all the the huge launches with the
RX 480 and all that sort of thing so no
sponsor which is good for you guys I
suppose now you have to listen to me
talk about cable mod cables and things
like that wide beam LED strips so none
of that but why don't we get right into
it shall we
before we before we actually dive into
the the contenders here I did want to
point you guys in the direction of a
pretty epic giveaway that I have going
on on the channel right now so there's
just a here's quick little time-lapse of
me building this system this is a my
first PC of the month for July which is
funny because I actually uploaded it in
June but it was towards the end of June
so it's the July build and it's a very
sexy system in the dark Bass Pro 900
from be quiet brand-new case from those
guys German manufacturer just a
beautiful chassis all around with
outstanding features to boot as well and
I'm giving the system away because I
don't know I just have no room for it I
have no use for it it's a really nice
system it's got a 60 600 K Core i5 in
there with a GTX 670 super super clock
from EVGA see all them sexy b-roll shots
oh yeah to meet you would still be
ashamed of me but I think it looks cool
so yeah you guys can go ahead and check
this video out on the channel write me
out and and enter and enter to
potentially win it one lucky sub will
get that whole entire system so just
putting it out there
hey if I'm not gonna get sponsored and
I'm not doing ads I might as well run my
own ads right so a pretty exciting
giveaway very easy to enter as well so
enough of that jibber-jabber let's go
ahead and talk about our first
contestant who is Adam there's a lot I
feel like there's been a lot of Adams on
awesome an awesome heart on booted this
in this series I feel like there's like
the fifth Adam I wonder if it's a
conspiracy
Illuminati so Adams got a Corsair
obsidian 350d and by the way I had very
little time to actually look over these
systems in their entirety so forgive me
if I'm like still trying to figure out
what the hell's in them but we've got a
core i7 3770k within that ASUS Maximus 5
gene motherboard 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance program and it looks like
we've got an r9 290x both the CPU and
GPU are water-cooled here let's take a
closer look at the side profile I'm
going to enlarge my window here so I can
see it a bit better now
this is I picked this one because well
for for one I think it looks pretty
badass and I think this is like external
radiator mounting I think can go one of
two ways there's no gray area when it
comes to external rads they either look
really really nice and they're very
well-done or it just looks like shit and
I think I think Adams did a really nice
job here just throw it slapping on in
120 at the back there a 120 rad it's
super phat it's one of those ek thick
rads just right at the rear and it looks
it looks really nice super clean it's
not too busy so I'm cool with that and
it just looks like he's really filled up
the 350 D here with just loads of loads
of hardware which is always nice to see
when you when you're really maxing out
the space capacity all that real estate
that you have in a case makes you feel
like you really got your money's worth
from buying that chassis so very very
good cable management it
kind of got that sort of like messy look
with the cables that the ATX and the
PCIe cables coming out but it's well
done it's not like messy messy it's like
intentionally kind of loose and
loosey-goosey and it looks really nice
you've also got some the tubing is soft
you have to get you have to get you hard
later Adam interpret that however you
like but soft tubing is also one of
those things that can either look really
sloppy and kind of kind of mishmash or
not mishmash but haphazardly thrown
together or it can look very nice I
think the shorter the bends with the
soft tubing the better and it looks like
Adams kind of done that here it's a
clear tubing PVC tubing but it's a UV
red he's using some UV red grade fluid
in there all right I believe the tubing
is fluids UV sorry so that looks pretty
cool I think you've got some other
pictures here we can get a closer look
it looks like you've water-cooled your
RAM as well I really like those ek
fittings going with that that
nickel-plated chromatic vibe I can dig
it yes this is looking good at him this
is looking good see what you will about
you know the typical red and black color
scheme I know it's played out I know we
see it everywhere and I'm tired of it
myself at times but I think this is for
what it's worth a really nice looking
system there's kind of a shot from the
exterior with all the LEDs on 350 350 DS
got that really nice large window that
just comes stock so really great to show
off the innards of your system it's got
a nice little fan controller up there on
the in the five and a quarter inch drive
bay take another look at the side here
now the power supply sticker looks
glossy but that's just because of the
reflection ax 1200 just you know all
those power supplies from Corsair have
that kind of gloss on them but it's it
doesn't really look like that all the
time I think it's just a bad angle or
whatever so it also looks like you've
got some temp monitors up there by your
five and a quarter inch base which is
pretty cool and obviously be able to see
I'm curious why you have two of them and
just maybe four different components
different parts of the chassis that's
pretty sweet
and a little little pomp res in there I
like it has a nice little build here
nice little system good job Adam
good job you're in the running you're in
the running all right so next up we've
got and I'm sorry if I'm butchering your
name Bogdan Bogdan I I don't know I
shouldn't even try anymore but looks
like you've got an enthe we've all beta
X and we're gonna be seeing quite a few
of these cases as well as define s's a
lot of fractal define s's in this season
of butit just because they are just
known for being really really good for
custom water-cooling a lot of a lot of
good support for pumps and reservoirs
and radiators and things like that but
I'm cool with that
obviously I'm cool to define us and I
almost considered building in the Evolve
ATX at one point for my for for hot line
but we've got a skylight 6700 K here and
I never put the overclock settings that
people give me in Buda just because I
feel like they're so easily fudged and I
generally trust everyone I'm a pretty
trustworthy person but you never know
someone could just completely lie and I
don't want that to be an indication or
like a factor of people's judgement when
they're voting for a system so I never
include the overclocked results on
either their CPU or GPU just a fun fact
their ACS z170 saber-tooth Mark one
motherboard 32 gigs of ram ddr4 gtx
980ti poseidon which is kind of funny
because the Poseidon already comes with
like built-in water cooling support but
you just feel like oh wait no did you
actually put a custom it looks like you
put a oh you are using the the stock
cooler you're using the stock beside the
core that's nice it's nice to see
someone actually using the Poseidon for
what it's intended for it sort of just
taking the cooler off and putting a
block slapping a block on it anyway and
it looks like you've done some
modifications to that as well looks like
part of the shroud you painted purple
you've got a nice very vibrant and neon
kind of lime green and purple vibe going
here I want to say it's like a Barney
vibe but it's not Barney it's more like
a joker vibe
Barney would mean like more purple and
like just like hints of green if Barney
was at a rave and he was UV reactive
hopefully you've got some which we call
it's and UV lights in here as well let's
say you've got like a UV strip going
over your power supply sticker which is
kind of interesting I haven't seen that
before but um I like this color scheme
it's different that's not too different
I mean usually when people go UV they
either go for the like the lime green or
like the hot pink or something like that
so but it's nice to see something that's
not red and black or you know black and
white for example so I like how you've
kind of ran with the theme here got some
fat radiators in there well not super
fat but you've got some some large ones
they're very they're long they might not
have may not have the girth they
certainly had the length it's what I
hear the ladies like these days okay so
um also gone with the gone with the UM
with the see-through water blocks for
the the RAM and the CPU which looks
really nice with the fluid that you've
chosen taking the closer look here you
like I just like custom water-cooled
builds because I feel like there's more
custom work put into them not just like
the water cooling aspect but I don't
know people whip out the spray can more
like you can see the little a little
motherboard families got in there that
tiny I don't know what that is like a 50
millimeter fan 40 millimeter fan or
something like that and painted that
purple and you got some thermal tape
ring fans and it's nothing more blingy
than some thermal tape ring fans I can
dig it and here's kind of a shot with
the side panel on looking through the
window this is kind of what what he sees
on a day-to-day and you can see that
he's also got some purple LEDs lining
the at the front of the case and
possibly at the bottom it looks like and
I kind of like that I really like how
you've got the green LEDs on the on the
Thermaltake ring fans and you've got the
purple on the the other two edges of the
case kind of gives a nice blend I like
that and it does look very electric
cannae reminds me of like those laser
tag arenas that you would go to and
everything's just like painted with like
neon paint there's like neon paint
everywhere
it looks really cool and as far as the
two bends go I think the two bends are
really nice like it matches with the
color scheme right it's very whimsical
and I mean you're taking like bends that
are not really necessary like there's a
much more practical way probably to like
do this bottom bottom tube here but the
curviness the curvature of the tubes
that you've done here which are pretty
well done from what I can see I kind of
just go with the personality of the
system kind of gives it that personality
I think you've done the stand-up job
here
Bogdan Bogdan sorry sorry I'm just
killing it all right let's move on to
the next one Brad Brad
you put the rad in bred with this system
buddy because you're fantex empty we
evolved chassis here which is micro ATX
is fricken killer core i7 4790k c 97 m
gaming 5 motherboard from msi 16 gigs of
ram a 780ti two of them super clock so
these are EVGA s and nice shmore g spork
of SSDs there let's take a look at the
side profile here oh we're gonna EK
supremacy evo man that is beautiful that
is a beautiful system right there and
just you you you just take you take the
cake for like having the nicest pictures
I think as well even you even brought
your you even took your system out of
your house and brought it to a bridge
probably over like a bubbling Creek or
something and a brook I don't know it
just looks very very professionally done
so nice on you good on you for that
night and again with the nice curvature
of that tube that's going from your it's
going from the CPU to the the GPU or
vice versa I suppose just really nice
really really clean to bending the bends
are which my penis looked like that
no um and the cabling the cabling is
also very nice if you take a look at the
money shot here wait I think there's a
better one okay so even with the side
panel on you get a lot a lot of a you
can see a lot through that window
just look at that cabling move that
nylon sleeving ooh just wanna just want
to make out with it so good so good
um yeah Brad this is a pretty read
pretty rad bread let's take another look
at the side profile here so I also
really like the gray fluid that you're
using I think that gray pastel is was a
really cool choice it's very different
I'm looking for uniqueness a lot of the
time with these builds here at boot and
booted because you just sees so many of
these rigs are a dime a dozen even if
they look really cool you've seen that
same build you know like three or four
hundred times this is very different
you've also painted the radiators here
which matched the the pastel very nicely
as well as the the cable sleeving got
those beautiful red fittings a nice EVGA
sli bridge they're just all together
everything matches here you've got the
right amount of color for your gray your
black and your red nothing no one color
is overpowering too much and I really
like that it's a the combination of like
the color palettes that you've used and
the the two bending and just how clean
everything is oh it's like it invokes
like a sense of tranquility when I look
at it it could also be that it's because
it's on a fucking bridge with like
autumn leaves and shit and it looks
beautiful but really well done really
nice work here Brad again you got the
supremacy Evo ek waterblock also using
the water blocks for for those seven ATT
eyes nickel acetal and guessing your
pump is down below where the just
underneath that power supply shroud
there's space for that in the Evolve ATX
fittings are these fittings are you use
in primo chill revolvers 13 tens
thirteen ten millimeters okay alright
nice Brad nice to be a tough one to beat
see if Brandon got branded up next to
and through evolved ATX this is a full
ATX system here so no micro ATX funny
business we've got a core i7 6700 k-rock
and skylake z1
Deluxe from ACS 16 gigs of RAM a GTX 780
and an Intel 120 gig SSD 530 series with
an NZXT hue pluse alright we got a black
and white system here and you've got two
reservoirs this first thing I see it's
kind of cool I think that's that's gotta
just be for looks right I mean I'm not
like a custom water cooling aficionado
like like Jays two cents or anything but
I would have to assume if there's only
one loop going on here then it's just
four that's just for the lawls that's
just for the bling factor I suppose but
they're there it's looking really nice
here the sleeving is very well done as
well I believe these are just a prebuilt
cables maybe like some BitFenix or cable
mod sleeving here that you have but you
do have some cable trainers on them
which is nice the two bending is pretty
good too I can't tell if it's the
perspective of the camera or if the
bottom tube that goes right over your
power supply shroud is kind of at a
slant I can't really tell but if it's
perfectly straight that's that's good
that's a good sign so you've obviously
only water-cooled your CPU here but
that's okay there is no requirement in
this season óbuda that you had to have
like every component water-cooled custom
water-cooled as long as there was like
one thing at least one thing custom
waterful preferably CPU or GPU be really
weird if you had an entire loop that was
just cooling you your your VRMs or some
shit like that so um yeah this is cool
let's take a look at what else you got
here man - it has a beautiful
motherboard you've got those those nice
Corsair SP and airflow fans with the
white rings the white rings of course of
course black and white builds like this
like arctic Panther from paul like
paul's arctic panther there is a memory
of milk i always make me want milk
you're just thinking like wow this has j
done the video of that yet can you use
milk for water cooling i think he has
could be wrong though I forget what the
results were especially if it's cold
milk that might be
but yeah let's looks really nice here
we've got a shot here with the the hue
plus that's on and I hope you're messing
with the more custom profiles there with
the hue plus if you bite a human you're
just rocking like a white just standard
static white LEDs then you should
probably look into like creating some
other profiles for it because that thing
can do a lot more than just white um but
looks like you've got you know I mean
the hue plus is great because it comes
with two long strips and you can pretty
much in a mid-tower ATX case like this
you can pretty much have enough length
to go all the way around gives it a
really nice even lighting which it looks
like you've done here
iron dress very nice very well I almost
show you guys the cable management side
I glad I did not do that lid did not do
that
uh the only critique here I would say is
possibly remove the power supply sticker
just I mean it's not like it clashes
color wise but just the fact that they
have like the rail chart they're like
the rail chart all the specs there it's
kind of clutter II it's not the most
aesthetic thing you'll you'll ever see
but overall very clean black and white
system here I like it I also noticed
your your water blocks upside down the
ek water block I'm not sure why that is
wonder why you Matt it upside down huh
I'm probably just too much of a noob to
figure it out but let's move on to Brian
Brian's our last contestant here and
he's gonna thermaltake core p5 this is
an open-air chassis for those of you who
are not too familiar with this case it
stands up vertically just like this and
it's I believe it's wall mountable I
think that's like one of the the main
features obviously you can also put it
on stands like Brian's done here but
there's a ton of radiator mounting
options here really large really long
radiators can fit on this thing you can
see he's got I believe a 420 or that's
I'm sorry that's a 480 it's got a 480
quad on the side and a 420 triple when
triple 140 s on the top pretty badass
that is sexy and looks like
cooling two GPUs either GTX 970 s these
are the msi one million 100 million
edition cards and you've also got AZ 97
and power max AC probably still to this
day the best motherboard potentially for
a black and black and yellow custom
custom water-cooled system just because
it's just one of those motherboards that
looks really nice and has yellow accents
you don't see too many of those and
you've also done some custom work on
your MSI SLI bridge there I can see two
bends are very straight very straight
all around I need to top that reservoir
off a bit but overall this is pretty
clean I think those are venturi fan no
those are ring fans Wow
they looked like a venturi for a second
but those are some more Thermaltake ring
fans also very nice I wonder if there's
I forget if there's an LED picture here
but you can also see the the love that
Brian's put into this system because
you've got yellow on the the HyperX fury
modules - just two of them so you spray
painted those yellow and it's just the
right shade of yellow to matches very
nicely with everything else
cables leaving is more or less solid
looks like there's a little bit of
bendiness kind of a kind of few
squiggles there the PCIe cables and the
ATX but overall not too shabby and if we
take a look at a closer shot here I
really do like that see through GPU
connector I like that I like it so I'm
gonna say about that got a drain and
fill or a drain valve right there at the
bottom of the res Samsung 850 Evo SSD
alright yeah I was looking for those
ring shots yes alright look at that
these must be the RGB yep they are the
RGB ones so you can obviously
tune the color to exactly what you want
which in this case would be yellow
what's really nice and I think with a
case like this since it's so open
there's not really like a like an actual
backside or like a top
it's kind of like half a case there's no
like exterior shell really it's open
fits like an open-faced sandwich it's no
barriers so for something like that you
couldn't really I don't know how you
would introduce something like an LED
strip like a hue plus or something in
the case like this because it's not I
mean it is a case but it's different so
um so you got the ring so you got the
rings for your bling excellent excellent
job Brian
excellent work my friend and I think
that's it yeah but that was number five
so those are the five contestants for
today guys think very long and hard
about which one you like the best and to
help jog your memory if you want to see
some pictures again
right about now my two faithful mods
spider fan as well as Mike the mana geek
should be posting up some links in chat
for you guys to go go to and vote on
which of those systems you thought
deserves to go on to the final ramp and
just a and while you're doing that if
you have no idea how the show works and
it's your first time because I kind of
forgot like maybe some people here have
never seen the show before just give you
a quick rundown on how it works so right
now we're on we're on week one so you
can see every week of this month for the
first three weeks of this month we have
five new contestants you guys vote on
which of those systems should go on to
the final round in week four obviously
once after week three will have three
final contestants and again you guys
will vote on which one of those three
deserves the grand prize which is $500
Amazon giftcard so far everyone's gone
with the Amazon card because you do have
the option for a steam gift card as well
but i think i think the amazon
marketplace is a bit more appealing more
diverse I do not blame them for at all
so ah guys go ahead and just think very
very carefully that what you want now
who you want to see in the final round
and man there's still so many so many
systems that are just really really good
in this season I'm very excited again
since we don't have a sponsor spot I'm
going to give you guys a little bit more
time to uh to just kind of look look
over the options here and in the
meantime I'm going to just go ahead and
just whore myself out a bit more gaming
PC I'm giving it away I'm giving this
away just for free wait that's me
I don't want me here just watch them
watching cool time-lapse shit for a
while it's got the the ek water blocks
predator a IO 240 plus 240 millimeter
one of the nicest area is probably the
nicest a IO
I've ever worked with it's just it's so
well thought out and how could it not be
it's from UK they know their shit they
know a thing or two about water cooling
I would say the only thing I don't like
about this system is the ketchup and
mustard cables from the dark power Pro
it's a great power supply don't get me
wrong but the the stock cables that it
comes with or just god-awful you know
ketchup and mustard back I tried to
cover it up with some some velcro straps
that sort of worked but sort of didn't
but anyway it's free you guys have no
ride took you can't complain actually
you have every right to complain but
yeah pretty exciting stuff so go ahead
and check that out y'all check it out
it's AMA channel it's called PC of the
month or building a building a PC and
giving it away or something like that
but that's all for you guys also I did
want to say a huge thank you I
completely forgot to mention this at the
beginning not that some of you guys even
care but um I recently surpassed four
hundred thousand subscribers on the
channel which I am extremely proud of
because two years ago I was at 50k or so
when I quit my full-time job at Newegg I
had about 45 50 thousand subscribers and
in within two years I'm at four hundred
that's that's just amazing to me it
blows my mind and I know obviously I put
a lot of hard work into it but I would
still be nowhere if it weren't for you

let's take let's take a look the results
here we've got we've got business to do
mm-hmm let's uh let's see I got to put
on the dark dramatic and ominous voting
music because it's a serious shit y'all
going back to the site we had five
contenders on this episode of booted as
we usually do ádám bogdán
or bogan brad brandon and brian you can
see I chose them in alphabetical order
because it's like there's like four
people with bees in their names anyway
these guys were giving it their all
they brought they brought the heat they
brought the fire but unfortunately only
ones going on to the final round and the
other four will be booted and set home
with nothing so who is it who gets to go
on to the final round boom Brad mr. rad
Brad with 138 of the votes 46% of the
pull boom Brad I had a feeling you would
win when of the second I saw that the
second I saw that system that sexy-ass
system good Lord good Lord Oh
oh yeah you know I wouldn't have sex
with many computers but I would have sex
with your computer Brad so I'm saying
look at that money just such a such a
creative system really and just so
professionally done nicer than most like
demo pcs that I see it conventions and
stuff this is really top class work man
you did a really nice job here so very
much looking forward to seeing you in
the final round at week four of this
month in July for the
water cold season of booted thank you so
much the rest of you as well for for
competing and for giving it your all
what's up why what winter Oh give me one
second
guys it's not his weight it's not his
system okay let's let's verify this
right now
do you have a picture of it or like what
all right let me see that let me see the
link he cheated oh hell no Brad you're a
bad boy
Brad calm down guys calm down thank you
for letting me know but I'm gonna go
ahead and just double-check this no no
cheater is going to win all right we're
gonna get to the bottom of this I bet
that uh let's see let's take a look here
this is not a link it's not a working
link hold on hold on doo doo doo doo doo
uh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh wait your
link isn't working
hmm
what about this one I don't see any
links that are working actually if you
guys can give me a proper link I would
be more than happy to bring it up the
debt that ha
jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù jiù exposed
keemstar exposed wait damn it
hold on
aha thank you Mike thank you very much
Mike
okay so it looks like let's let's take a
look here so you guys can see what I'm
seeing all righty
all right
okay Wow this looks like this definitely
looks like the same systems the exact
same picture on the same bridge oh man
Bridget's Photoshop now I can't trust
anything so who is this guy Samsung from
Germany do your public profile I can't I
can't look at it because I'm not a
member
um yeah I'm not a member either okay so
here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna I'm
gonna verify with the person because I
have this person's email whoever set the
entry of the system to me for booted I
have their email so I'm gonna contact
them and I am going to say you know send
me a picture of your system with like
you know with your wiener in it and
write awesome sauce on your wiener or
something of this you know so it's like
undeniable that it's his that he
actually has the rig with him in person
I'm not gonna make him show his wiener
that's it's probably illegal but I'm
gonna verify it in the event that it is
his then he will continue being the week
one finalist for this episode of booted
in the in the event that he is not
genuine and he is full of shite be very
sad
but that we had better contestants than
that but I will also be giving the win
to Bogdan Bogdan who got second place
here twenty nine percent of the votes
well we went to Bogdan so um he will win
with his uh his electric UV green and
purple belt in the event that Brad is
full of shite and does not actually own
the the empty we evolved micro-atx
system that's unfair I'm gonna let the
the chat catch up with the stream stop
playing the scary music again like the
scary music so let me know let me know
guys if that sounds fair to you and
obviously I would have to give you guys
the news I'll update you on Twitter once
I find out if if Brad is is is legit or
not and then I'll also be obviously
recapping and announcing the official
winner of this episode on next week's
episode I'm not going to do a dab there
are more important things here now I
can't do a revote right now if I do a
revote because we still don't know
whether or not Brad is legit and until
we figure that out we cannot Reva or if
you're saying do a revote next week well
that wouldn't make sense because people
are voting under the assumption that
initially that Brad was legit and he
still once so technically okay fair
we're good we're good
all right cool um that sounds good then
guys again I apologize for shit like
this happening and for things like this
popping up I do appreciate you guys
bringing it to my attention and thank
you to my beautiful wife are also
alerting me of this of this odd
situation I'm really hoping that that
things work out and that Brad is not
full of shit but um what can you do
people people are trolls guys you got to
learn to live with trolls I suppose
you'll never you'll never get rid of all
the trolls in the world all you can do
is learn to deal with them to the best
of your ability and have a wife that
smacks you on the head once in a while
tells you tells you what to do but thank
you guys so much for tuning in this is
of a weird ouch I don't know if I should
say they Congrats again to Brad no Brad
I'll be contacting you very shortly
today right after the show and I'm gonna
be asking you some questions don't worry
guys my vetting process is very very
concrete and very secure
I'm sure dick pics so thank you guys
again so much have a very happy and safe
4th of July if you guys are lighting on
fireworks be careful I was just reading
an article about some little girl 9 year
old girl blew her hand off frickin
firework or something like that make a
great story for us and hardware though

not exploit it in any way so guys be
very careful this year also drunk

you're in the states that I mean if
you're in the States drunk drivers are
everywhere anyway but especially on
