new egg TV crew just landed in Taiwan in
Taipei just about half an hour ago and
we just got to our hotel we're at the
AMPA Hotel in Taipei and pollen eyes
room is room 806 but why don't we take a
look inside maybe see maybe we'll see
some differences here so first off when
I first came in here is pitch black and
as I go looking for the light switch
around here could not find a light
switch for the life of me finally
realized you actually got to insert your
key card for power just once you take it
out and you have power for the rest of
the time until you leave your room again
it'll automatically shut off not sure
what the battery thing is going on here
it's a sticker on the wall or it's just
painted on there so I guess this room is
always on low battery I was expecting
Paul to be here but he's not I saw his
baggage is here so I know he's checked
in already there's me as you can see I
look like a total train wreck cuz I was
just on a 13 hour flight 14 hours
actually but a closer look at the sink
here got some where's that ginger soap
okay's camera phone do what I tell you
to
anyway that's ginger soap and then
lastly we have the bedroom area the
sleeping area which is kind of
concerning to me well first off here's
my luggage but it's kind of concerning
to me because there's only one small bed
for Paul and I and there's really not
much room at all on the floor for
anywhere to sleep on so I don't know I
really don't know what's going to
transpire by the end of tonight but I
just hope it doesn't end with me wrapped
in Paul's arms his manly hairy arms
alright so now I'm walking down some
Street in Taipei right next to my hotel
haven't ventured too far I'm probably a
quarter mile a half a mile away just
kind of been walking in one direction
there's a lot of little shops it's still
pretty early right now so I don't think
much is open right now but you can see
the go pets have already started making
their way around the city I definitely
got to watch out for those I've almost
been nicked a couple times in the last
five minutes so maybe I should be a
little bit more careful where I'm
walking this is a one-way street though
so that should help essentially though I
did think this was pretty interesting
this is a movie theater
it's actually an IMAX and I thought was
pretty cool because the consistent
concession stand and the cash register
for the tickets is all in the same place
if you can see it's kind of like semi
outdoors you're just walking around
outside and there's not even any like
door I don't think there's a door that
closes at night I think it's just
completely open just completely open so
you could walk right up buy your ticket
and all your popcorn while you're
outside and then you just go straight
back into the theater into one of the
big rooms back there just a little
slight difference in culture and design
that I thought was worth noting there's
another go pad but essentially I'm going
to go try to find some breakfast and
yeah I guess hopefully I don't get hit
by a go pad alright so I just finished
having my very first breakfast in Taiwan
I ordered it all by myself I'm very
proud of myself
luckily the guy that worked there spoke
some English she was actually very
helpful and I was able to translate
everything that I pointed out on the
menu basically I got this kind of egg
with tortilla which is something that my
Taiwanese groom ate back home had got me
the day before so I kind of knew that
that was gonna be good and then I would
like that kind of came in like a sweet
almost a teriyaki slash soy sauce sauce
I guess you could say I was really
delicious and then the burger thing kind
of looks like egg McMuffin you know that
was made in Candyland for example I was
actually pretty good I didn't like it as
much as the egg I wasn't a huge fan of
the Bund it was a little too sweet for
my liking
overall not a terrible experience it was
pretty packed at the place that I went
to so there was nowhere to sit down so I
just took it to go which I indicated to
the guy by making a stick figure out of
my two fingers and and making it run
across that was my sign language for to
go he seemed to understand it cuz he put
everything in a little plastic bag for
me but after that I took my breakfast
elsewhere and sat down at a bench nearby
there was a little table nearby but I
didn't realize that was actually a table
for another breakfast place so it kind
of I kind of look like a dick ordering
food somewhere else and then eating it
at somebody else's restaurant I felt
really bad I was going to get up as like
oh I'm sorry and then the lady was like
no no it's okay it's okay she insisted
that I stay there and continue feeling
like an asshole
so I did I did eat pretty quickly after
that though wrapped it up and now on the
road again so see the time is it's about
nine thirty five nine forty five is
supposed to meet up with the others at
10:00 or 10:15 so I got a little bit
more time to kill it's too early for a
beer beer sounds really good
Wow look at that it's like a biker gang
every five seconds and then a bus in
your face just so congested down this
little street very bit of wide streets
probably three lanes but people are just
going by on mopeds and stuff like it's
no big thing even like old ladies like
this lady she's like about to die and
she's like oh excuse me giant bus that's
about to kill me pardon me
alright guys so now I am actually in
Taipei 101 it is the tallest building in
all of Taiwan and I probably could
probably see it somewhere else from the
outside in this video if you haven't
already but it's just a massive building
both in girth as well as in height
obviously you call it Taipei 101 because
it has a hundred and one floors right
now I'm only on the 36th floor but it
feels like I'm a lot higher if you're
wondering why I'm in here than it being
awesome because I'm also interviewing
pika by I just got done interviewing
gigabyte and the lovely folks over there
but waiting for the rest of the new egg
TV crew to meet up with us I'm just just
Rachel and I here for now but my trip
has been going awesomely so far in case
you were wondering
but yeah more on this later
some at 7-eleven right now and for those
of you who don't already know there's
pretty much a 7-eleven on every block in
Taipei
that's not even exaggeration I've
actually seen three 711s simultaneously
from where I was standing but here's the
beer section of it taking a liking to
Taiwanese beer I've always been a fan of
Japanese beer and Asian beer in general
I guess but one that I've had never had
before that I've actually started to
really like is the beer it's actually
seven 7-elevens brand of beer and I
actually really like it I think it's
really good and it's relatively
inexpensive just like pretty much
everything here anyway
but essentially Taiwan's cool because
you can just buy beer and drink it on
the street there's no issue with it
whatsoever you can even bring it in to
other stores drink just like a total
drunkard pretty cool stuff I'm gonna I'm
gonna buy my beer
go down how's it going guys here now at
the sheet land food market or the night
markets a night markets a great popular
here in Taiwan basically it's kind of
like an outdoor swap meet if you will a
lot of little shops vendors everywhere
everything from clothing to food lots of
lots and lots of food that I guess the
idea is you get a little bit of
everything so you get some variety down
to eat everything in one place so that's
what we're doing now we're about to get
our first first snack over the night
which looks to be like some sausage some
sausages and wings and we also got some
some body parts in there as well so are
you talking to your camera no god I'm
talking to you now I got to be the star
of the show I hey your soul patch is
crooked another day marking right now
where there's a lot of food vendors a
lot of different things here I've kind
of ventured away from the typical
tourist attractions I'm completely in
unfamiliar territory this is where all
the locals are pretty much this is I
guess how they shop you know I actually
saw a butcher with just like slabs of
meat hanging from hooks this is an
authentic Taiwan style right here it's
uh
I'm completely this is the most out of
my comfort zone I felt there this entire
trip I don't think there's a single
person here that knows much English but
it's it's it's an experience nonetheless
so hopefully I make it out of this live
a beautiful temple that I just stumbled
across there's red lanterns everywhere
some amazing architecture you just tell
the things like a million years old
alright guys so we just checked into our
second hotel basically we're on the
later half of our trip
there's Paul being Paul this is his
fourth hotel and this is my fifth hotel
that's right he's been he's even been
homeless a couple times throughout the
trip but we finally landed at our last
hotel that we'll be staying at which is
pretty interesting layout all of you
will draw the curtain for us please to
to show us the view of the beds it's the
shower and bathtub so and also the
toilets so uh Paul needs to be taking a
crap and I just want to be able to make
eye contact with them for whatever
reason they totally do so even even more
interesting than that is the toilet
itself I should say because look it's a
bidet I've actually never used one of
these but you know I think I feel
something coming up you're coming out so
why don't I why don't I test this out
right now okay can you please draw the
two other curtain again Paul no but I I
need to go really bad thank you thank
you Paul
this will be the best unboxing ever hey
there's a little slip I can still see
you that's creepy
hold it alright guys so I'm just about
wrapped up here doing the thing I'm
going to do this for the first time ever
I think I click the bidet button first I
definitely don't want to hit this strong
button or the high button spray spray
bidet let's just do it ready Oh No
it's doing something there's a big red
stuff but oh my god you didn't push the
warm button there's no warm it's just
did you read the instructions it's on
the hanger thing it's behind the toilet
paper geez come on toilet needs
instructions this is stupid
alright so Paul and I were just walking
around near our third hotel that we're
staying at and we kind of stumbled
across what looks to be like a farmers
market it is Sunday so maybe it only
comes out on Sundays but we're not
really sure but I look pretty
interesting they're selling bunch of
food fruits and vegetables and stuff
like that so they have free samples so
this is basically an Asian Costco that
we're at so out of all the little
vendors here Paul actually came across
something he liked which was some grapes
these grapes actually do look really
fresh
they look really for refreshing he's
taking a free sample right now oh yeah
he likes it he's going for the grapes
they do look pretty amazing though
they're they're really just like have a
beautiful color so they look really
refreshing in this ridiculous heat right
now you can see them all right there so
I think he's just gonna get like one
bundle or one bunch of grapes there it
is I think it's a how much 150
all right he's gonna he's gonna get a
bunch for 150 NT which is roughly well
pretty much five dollars five US dollars
definitely more than you pay and like a
convenience store or something like that
around here but I think it is a
specialty item these are probably a lot
a lot better lot fresher than something
you'd find otherwise all right so on our
little escapade
Paul Paul and I also stumbled upon this
little gem it's a bank wa electronic
Plaza so all the shops here are just
basically selling electronics there's
like gigabyte and asrock ads everywhere
so we're pretty excited this is like
Taiwanese fries pretty much on steroids
then we go in here and see what kind of
goodies we can find all right so we're a
little camera store there's a 5d mark ii
right here we're gonna see how much it
costs us you know there's how much is it
fourteen hundred bucks for a 5d Mark -
okay you paid - no I Paul paid a lot
more than that
so wow you don't really have that much
NT I'm at this point but that is quite a
steal it check out this pretty cool SATA
cable oh wait no that's just a USB
charging cable
alright so apparently LEDs are super
cheap here because while they're
manufactured here a lot cheaper than in
the u.s. just take a look at this thing
for example it comes with a full-color
remote control so however you're feeling
whatever mood you're in forth but just
look at the the massive amount of LED
strip connection you have here this is
probably like a thirty foot maybe 20
foot just roll of LED strip so you write
your name in cursive you can make a
stick figure with it put it on your wall
look at that that is ridiculous and I
think it's how would you say it was well
like 30 bucks 30 five bucks here so Paul
is now he's found a few LED strips that
he thinks he likes but he has no idea
what color they are cuz so well that
one's blue so there's actually a little
testing station that you can bring your
parts to and they'll try it out for you
make sure that you want to buy it so the
first one was blue Paul seems to like
that one I'm gonna get into certain of
color these are not 4 bucks each
4 bucks each we got an AMD build
yes let's get green video
and I just got to get a Titan oh I have
alright get most of them back single
tear so in this little shop just one of
many that are in this area managed to
find some gentle typhoons in the store
they're usually sold out on every
website that I've ever looked at you
really got to like put some Auto
notification on to even find them online
but here they are just go ahead and buy
as many as you want as many as they have
in stock so if there's one thing that
I've repeated over and over about my
trip here to Taiwan is that Taiwan is
very thoughtful culture they think of
everything so right here I'm in a public
bathroom underground next to the MRT
subway and in case in case you ever need
it there is an emergency button that you
can actually press it anytime if for
whatever reason you I don't know run out
of toilet paper or god forbid following
the toilet I guess I'm doing the
underground mall at Taipei main station
interviewing fractals design this is
Josh I'm good as well thank you sir yeah
I really love your hair I love the color
of it I love your facial hair as well oh
that's actually face paint okay well I
really got I love you guys before you
guys are doing the fractal design your
Scandinavian minimalistic style with all
your cases keep up the good work and
hopefully I'll see you soon all right
it's hard to see but in Taiwan the
crosswalks actually have an animation
going so there's a little dude that will
run and as the timer runs out and you
get closer to going he'll actually start
running faster as you can see I guess oh
we're eating some seafood some amazing
clams we got some amazing vegetables and
stuff here in Taipei and we just
stumbled across this adorable dog it
just looks like a teddy bear it doesn't
even look real recording yes oh my God
look at cute dude this dog needs to be
in commercials you just want to punch it
across a football field so cute put it
in a meat grinder
we just got off the brown line we're
kind of near the Taipei Zoo but we're
not here for the animals we're actually
here to check out Mao Kong mountain it's
basically a pretty famous well-known
mountain around here apparently if you
go up pretty far up you can actually get
to a place that is very famous for their
tea supposed to have really good tea so
we're gonna go up in the mountain drink
some tea and hopefully be able to check
out a kick-ass view from the top all
right we are at Din Tai Fung right now
it's a very famous world-renowned
dumpling house really good restaurant
this is the original Din Tai Fung that
we're at right now we actually went
earlier in this trip but it was at the
one at Taipei 101 which is not the
original we finally made it here on our
second to last day it's kind of cool you
can see a window here where they're
making the dumplings see those dumplings
bring me the dumplings yeah they're very
busy they're all very very sanitary as
well face masks and Pat's paradise
I'm not messing around here oh there's
my seat oh please dumplings what are you
doing with those dumplings you give
those to me nope I guess I'll be eating
them pretty soon all right guys this is
my last few hours here in Taipei
beautiful country of Taiwan it's uh it's
been a great adventure great rad I'm
gonna miss all the 7-elevens I'm gonna
miss being able to drink in public I'm
gonna miss the wall I won't miss the
Taiwanese massage cuz that was painful
as hell I'm gonna miss the people as
well the people here have been so nice
and just extremely generous shown me
that you know you know I don't have to
be afraid in a foreign country because
there is still good in humanity some in
some places of the world so it's been a
great time I'm gonna finish it off by
having the drink at this lounge slash
bar I think it's called steam or yeah
Stream actually but yeah in a few hours
I will be hopping on the plane
and headed home so hope you guys have
enjoyed this little travel blog that
I've concocted yeah thanks for joining
me along for the ride I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
