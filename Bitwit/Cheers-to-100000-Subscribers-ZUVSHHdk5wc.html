enthusiasts apparel awesomesauce shirts
are not only threaded they're hyper
threaded and come factory overclocked
get yours today at the awesomesauce two
loads of gas so I'm gonna start off by
saying that I've been waiting a long
time to make this video I mean I started
the channel back in October of 2012 and
nearly three years later I'm both
honored and humbled to be celebrating a
hundred thousand subscribers on
awesomesauce network it's really been
quite an amazing three years when you
think about it not just for the channel
but for my personal life as well as most
of you know it wasn't more than ten
months ago when I resigned from my
managerial position at newegg and began
a full-time career in YouTube because I
was just sick of the financial stability
and the health benefits obviously
dealing with the sizeable pay cut after
leaving newegg was a big struggle at
first and even today there are months
where I feel like I'm hanging by a
thread but the tremendous growth of the
channel seen in the last few months and
reaching 100 k have been validation
enough that I made the right decision to
venture out on my own granted i can't
say i've been entirely alone since then
when i left newegg my grandparents
invited me into their home for next to
nothing so that i could have a place for
the channel while finding my footing my
parents and friends have been cheering
me on and really taking an interest in
my videos which means a lot because they
usually don't know what the hell I'm
talking about and my beautiful fiance
heather has been my lifeline in all of
this always offering her encouragement
advice and the living room when I need
to use it for filming so honey I love
you and I can't wait to call you my wife
on our wedding day next month which
reminds me you still have about four
weeks to back out so you're not feeling
it chop-chop and I guess the last group
of people that I have to thank is you
because without your viewership and
comments and the inspiring stories that
you've shared with me I'm just a guy
talking to a camera it's only through
our ability to communicate on this
two-way street called the interwebs that
we're able to build a relationship and a
community worth sticking around for and
in that respect you guys aren't just my
viewers you're my extended family so
whether you've been with me since day
one or you just subscribe this week you
have been the driving force that's
helped bring me
here today and ultimately the secret
ingredient to what makes this channel so
great that's right you are the awesome
sauce you're the Invisible gunky
dressing that holds us together the same
gravy that can only be seen under a
heavy black light all that's sticky
gooey stuff of the funny smell that's
you so cheers to 100,000 subs to all of
your support and a bright future for
awesomesauce network as always stay
tuned for more tech stuff coming real
soon and I'll see you all in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
