starting the stream a whole two minutes
early because I just wanted to get kind
of give a warm up for all of you guys
who are watching right now and for
myself I just make sure everything is
running smoothly I got in contact to
Intel through full screen which is the
multi channel network that I am
partnered with through YouTube and
whatnot and so there was a rep from
fullscreen who was like hey you know I
hear you're in detecting stuff you might
be interested in this opportunity this
weird boxes they have their stuff inside
of it we want you to do kind of a
surprise unboxing a mystery unboxing if
you will so about a week later this
arrived on my doorstep and and now it's
time for me to unbox it I literally have
I shouldn't say I have no idea what it
is because they kind of dropped some
hints so I think there might be a
processor in here what are the new
skylake processors but I'm not sure
which one and the box is super heavy so
I I'm thinking there's got to be more in
there than just a little CPU but why
don't we take a look at the box first of
all because the box in itself warrants a
whole discussion I could go on for four
days about the box it is pretty cool
again it's called the Intel box Master
System and I've got my my handy-dandy
webcam setup here look at this boom ha
ho yeah I I planned this I totally
thought this through so here's a good
look at the front of the box and I kind
of like that they've done they've made
it look like kind of a retro Atari type
package with like the really cheesy
cartoon family on the front and just
like the text and the the neon colors
the stupid rainbow things stripe on the
side that we're all familiar with it
even has like a fake video game
cartridge that's supposed to resemble
like an Atari or maybe an even an nes
cartridge but let me just read the the
actual flavor text here it says well
first off you get new hifi 8-bit audio
which is impressive i should say it is
not full of rocks cuda cores don't lie
don't spoil it for everyone ah damn it
it's just a bunch of rocks so it says
the Intel box Master System is fun for
the whole family I should read it in a
really cheesy 80s voice you tonight the
Intel box masters
stem is fun for the whole family dive in
with immersive color enabled
interactivity that delivers a wholesome
and educational gaming experience the
kids will love it and so will mom and
dad now that's just neat non-stop action
numeric scoring true-to-life game sounds
easy touch control pad and high quality
wood paneling I i will die inside if
this thing if whatever in here has high
quality wood paneling I think that'll be
hilarious but I highly doubt that I
think this is all just kind of for
theatrics it's a sky guardians
exclusively for Intel and for Intel box
and first I was like no way did they
actually include some kind of old-school
Atari Intel game Intel sponsored
cartridge in here that's like from the
80s or whatever and no it says sold
separately so they're just uh just blow
and smoke there it also says electric
toy okay I believe it's electric I
believe that toy not so much I think
they might be a might be an
underwhelming statement there caution
recommended for children six years and
over so if this is a cpu kids who are
are six and over you can start
overclocking at that young age has that
very prime that prime time in your eat
and your youth recommended for children
six years and over as with electric all
electric toys precautions should be
observed during handling and use to
prevent electric shock so uh maybe
there's an anti-static wristband in here
as well no adult toys up getting ideas
all right here we go really ready I'm
gonna unveil it drumroll drumroll please
oh it's another box Wow okay that was
those a bit disappointing there but this
this one looks a bit more sturdy it
looks like it kind of looks like a
toolbox actually so let me take this out
quick it's got a nice foam packaging so
that's good that's a good indication
that what's inside of this box isn't
broken yet at least all right oh look at
that it is it does have high quality
wood paneling yes I mean look at this
box this box is kind of crazy looking
this is very old-school it reminds me of
an old NES stuff
only very cool oh it's got even it's
even got like a fake some fake power
port that looks like a like a DC power
port right there like the old school any
yes but it's a totally fake it's just
carved into the wood some plastic
etching and stuff ok so um I guess I
guess I should open this right let me
Center this so you guys can see all
right here we go opening up there's
there's more secrets there's more
suspense here I what am I gonna actually
get to see what's in this stupid thing
ok it's got a power switch and some kind
of like some buttons here with a reset
I'm going to flip the power switch Oh
what's happening reset guys I can't I
can't it's not working the power I'm not
supposed to actually turn this on
there's no power i mean that's
completely fake so it's got to be a
built-in battery of some sort it is not
a time machine okay I'm gonna try to
just open it with pure force guys don't
try this at home hahaha I totally hacked
that shit totally hacked yeah I'm gonna
figure out what went wrong with this up
I see there's a look at this there's a
bit of damage here I guess the foam
packaging didn't work out all so well
after all but it looks like one of the
bull there's a battery there's a battery
in here hold on let me switch back to
the the DSLR you guys can kind of see
here it looks like one of the batteries
slipped out of its socket there and I'm
going to try to put it back in I hope
this works I don't electrocute myself
haha ok the power switch still isn't
working you know what screw it I've
already open the box I don't need that I
don't need any of that crap I'm sure ok
so what they told me I do know what this
is though they did reference this in the
email apparently this thing is supposed
to you have to kind of enter a code to
unlock the box and the code was each
each one of these buttons essentially
represents a a note a musical note of
some sort and you had to do the the
Intel theme mm zoom to actually unlock
the box which i thought would have been
really cool for the stream but
unfortunately i think one of the
something happened in shipping and it
kind of got damaged or just that one of
the batteries got kicked out i tried
putting the battery back in but it still
didn't work so onto the onto the meat of
this package let's just go right back to
the webcam here give you guys a good
look AMD's box wouldn't have broke is
that is that a fact intel inside
unlocked performance outside and i do
have to give a really quick shout out to
intel if you guys haven't checked that
out already you can go to their unlocked
performance website i will put it in the
videos video's description if you're
watching this on youtube if you're not
watching it on YouTube that you can go
to it IM te ly / unbox i'll just type it
in chat right now I and to EG dot oh boy
/ own box for more information um and
you can kind of find out a little bit
more about I don't know maybe how to get
one of these kits I'm not too sure but
whoa hey intel core i7 processor should
have seen this right from the get-go but
just cut my eye right here we've got an
i7 skylake processor and i can only
assume this is a 6700 k which if it is i
will be very excited because I have the
perfect hardware to kind of go with it
and to complement it so let's open it up
I'm gonna go ahead and switch over to
the webcam boop boop loopy webcam time
here we go haha pink phone my fav and
underneath that is it's a says intel
confidential so it is an engineering
sample but it is clocked at 4 gigahertz
which means it's a 6700 k so sweet we
got a 6700 k guys that's pretty awesome
usually is a close up look at the chip
and this is actually really great
because I'm sorry the the glare on this
web cam is just god-awful but i will be
doing some benchmarks with this now that
I have one I didn't have a 6700 k
beforehand up until now I did have a
6600 k the core i5 which I got directly
from Intel oh I think the I think my um
my DSLR lens just auto shut off so let
me just go ahead and click that really
quick there we go oh love love live
streaming it's just like shit goes wrong
and no fucks are given because because
that's how we do but let's move on to
the rest of the package it is still
quite hefty there might be something
else in here oh no they did not oh no
they did in did it in and and the wood
no way really a 750 series nvme SSD holy
moly this is pretty sweeten this is the
the pci express version as well oh my
goodness 400 gig it's not the one point
two terabytes model I would have liked
that higher capacity but I am NOT gonna
complain at all let me go ahead and get
I'm just going around here all right why
are you guys saying rest in peace is
that is that in reference to the stream
are we still alive I hope so oh we're at
97 viewers we're at 97 viewers let's
let's try to hit 100 let's freakin do it
alright let's wreck in open this thing
up wow I'm actually look at this pcie
gen3 by four awesome awesome awesome
awesome I don't have one of these at all
I know Paul has the two point
inch version but I don't think he has a
pci-express model I think he's just got
the the two and a half inch let me put
in arctic Panther is a custom water pool
built wow this is I've actually never
even seen one of these in person Jesus
it's it's it's pretty guys it's a very
pretty card and wow I I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this but I'm excited
at the possibilities because holy shit
this is this is such a nice little
package that Intel's thrown together
here but there you guys have it let me
know what you guys want me to do with
this I mean maybe other than some
typical benchmarks what kind of
benchmarks would you want to see done
with this nvm you drive because I'm kind
of at a loss right now I'm a little just
like kind of in shock this has been
pretty sweet but um I know I know you're
all getting an erection I know it's
trust me this table actually got like
two inches higher after opening that but
I think that's pretty much going to
conclude it for now guys thank you guys
