threaten their smoothest intro ever
welcome guys it's awesome hardware
episode 136 I think yeah at this point
once you get to a hundred you like it so
it all blends together three times a
baker's dozen wait a baker's dozen is
thirteen
it's 10/10 Baker's does half a dozen did
you say three baker's dozens yeah that'd
be thirty which is known as thanks for
being here guys
yay um we're happy to do the show today
yeah we're good it's good to be here
we're glad that you're here this is a
live tech news show loosely appalled and
I do every single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time right here on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware we also stream
live to YouTube's actually we split it
up into two halves on the youtubes today
we're streaming to my channel first all
right this is your channel there's my
side side a and then after about an hour
or so we'll switch over to Paul's
channel you can go ahead and check that
out in the link in the description if
you're watching on YouTube or even go to
Paul's Hardware YouTube channel um let's
see we we like to have some fun on the
show it's it's pretty loose we keep it
pretty cash and we tend to have a few
drinks so if you're of legal drinking
age then please enjoy feeling feel free
to enjoy an adult beverage with us
during the show I'm Allison it makes us
a lot more enjoyable and entertaining
and and and you know what what what what
mess is on its way out no no it's not
because you remember mouth that is it no
you probably had it for a long time you
know this it's lasted a lot longer than
it should have considering that I check
it into a backpack with no protection so
might be for all my my sickness it's
it's it's it's double clicking like it
doesn't detect that I'm holding it down
so like the double click it's like if
I'm dragging a window it suddenly
maximizes it that kind of thing when
you're trying to resize windows and
Windows 10 when it doesn't let you know
yeah I'm trying to find the handle yeah
it's not there there's the cursor so the
other thing that we do on the show is
we occasionally use adult language so
you have little ones around er if you
have sensitive ears then your muffs just
clamp your mouth your hands tightly over
their mouth and nose because there will
be no warning you'll not give you a
warning key we decide to spew some sort
of oil they won't hear anything
keep the earplugs in ever again um but
overall it's a pretty fun show hope you
guys enjoyed I saw some people in chat
saying it was their first time catching
us live so welcome welcome to the show
cheers Cheers to all of you all you
first-timers as well
mm-hmm-hmm we also sell things Thank You
in case you didn't know we sell
beautiful things our merchandise stores
have really grown in the last year or so
going from just a couple shirt designs
to an onslaught of things you can buy
beautiful pint glasses from Paul's
hardware's channel more historic awesome
Hardware large mugs with yes fancy
pictures on them yes these are great
mugs very high-quality as well
nice nice paint jobs designs by Brian
good screening and printing on all of
the shirts and glasses and decals and
other things mouse pads
I haven't we both have mouse mats and
they're awesome and if you guys happen
to buy nothing it's real good stuff we
will shout Jack Johnson
Jansen will shout Johnson at you at the
end of the show you'll get a double
Johnson if you happen to pick up
something from both of our stores mister
is your inter stream and it will be wild
and intense but you'll thank us later my
store is is good it is good every time I
go on your websites Paulie George thanks
myself look at that bottle openers right
there opening the bottle this is all
very good yeah I still get a bottle
opener like that and those things are
awesome although what is odd requests
maybe in a second generation make it two
or three millimeters thinner so I can
use it to to fix my my cold plate to my
camera that's the only thing that my
Nvidia one that looks exactly like yours
has a leg up Oh
able to do them yeah it's like ever so
slightly bitter that would weaken the
overall structural rigidity I mean
there's a lever it's just a lever versus
a bottle cap right what does they need
to be so what think you of all people
would want all the tools possible for
opening bottles yes this is true you
know it was a good point you don't want
to don't want to cheap out in that I
also see the value of name labels these
days yeah limited space speaking of
which I should be this more being ooh
we do need more like the way you think
um I don't know what you can do well I'm
gone I can I can definitely do some
stuff Paul I'm great bullshitting the
stream
thank you very much bazinga from the $10
donation you bring up a great point
anyone who would like to donate through
YouTube super chat is more than welcome
to you will be reading all the messages
you attach develop to those donations at
the end of each half of the show so rest
assured even though we don't call out
during the show when you when you make
the donation we will you will be heard
at the end thank you very much in
advance for anyone who would like to
show us some love in that way oh god I
could you know as soon as you did that
and I realized what model it was for
some reason I immediately heard the jaws
theme song in my head that is the very
same bottle will not the exact bottle
but the same type of beer and everything
Chimay Grande I suppose that caused all
hell to break loose into my open this
momentarily great you will open that
momentarily I will help you drink it
only once you've uncorked it I'll be
very careful with it we should start
sharing these with the audience though
that's what yeah absolutely so our first
good point Paul our first topic or a
first segment I should say is ask the
audience where we ask you guys a few
questions and Paul and I sorta have to
gauge or guess what your answers are
gonna be or pletely
it's basically and we postulates and
we're given sort of a quiz to test how
well we know you as our I mean
technically you guys know
we've learned a bit about us we should
know a lot about you too so they're an
intimate things about the absolutely
that's what the segment is designed for
this so our first question for you guys
these are you know answer honestly if
possible I know it's hard to ask the
internet that these days but if you need
it if you need it imagine in a
hypothetical situation that you're
gaming PC or whatever gaming system
you're you're on currently died
completely died and you needed a new
gaming system in 2018 what would you do
how would you respond because things are
crazy right now things yourself
DRAM GPUs are so expensive so a couple
options here first one is bite the
bullet and pay out the ass for that GPU
and DRAM I need my games man mei-mei
name announced you're right you're right
I wrote it but I can't pronounce it or
you cry in a corner and put all gaming
on the hold if you dare because no way
in hell are you paying those for those
prices no way take the path you citizen
yep or you could buy a console that
admittedly is reasonably priced and then
you go crying 1/4 path of the coward the
coward yes so I'm quite quite quite a
great list of options you have there
yeah plenty of it the illusion of choice
is stronger so go ahead and blow that up
answer honestly everyone let us know how
you feel you already covered YouTube and
twitch you're on it I posted twitch and
cell-cell by the way that sells spider
is also a haste by inspired long time no
see spider I thought you were dead I'm
glad you're not
and thank you can't kill seeing him here
that's that's that's true especially not
his biggest fan right okay so thank you
both
Sal in spite of being here and posting
those links because I'm slow let's see
how do we usually do this do we usually
just go on to the next one
what will argue to preview every of the
next one yeah alright the preview the
next one next question let's pick one
think about
the next question is how has Intel
overall handled this whole meltdown and
Spectre debacle so far this is a very
fix big season o fix
sorry debacle I mean debacle fix there's
somewhat interchanging depending on so I
want to hear your guys's honest thoughts
and opinions on this they're doing the
best they can
way to go and tell keep it up keep on
giving us those faulty patches or
complete and utter garbage to quote
linus torvalds name for volunteers /
vaults we'll be talking about him in his
response later don't let that influence
you on this on his question though or
AMD user here so well they don't care
well that you shouldn't be doing this if
you're talking about melt them and
inspecting this is a good point AMD is
definitely still susceptible this is a
good point I added I actually added the
specter and later cuz I was only gonna
address meltdown I forgot to change that
aah-aah-aah
I'll be it I feel like even with Specter
AMD users aren't quite in the hole as
much as a lot of Intel users don't do
but I guess I guess that remains to be
seen no it's weird seeing that the
checkboxes on strawpoll appear later um
just happen I know look what's going on
with the stream is it broken
okay so guys go ahead and answer those
as well let's let's move back to our
first question though and try to figure
out what you guys are feeling when it
came to when it comes to buying a new
gaming system in 2018 if you were forced
to respond in some way to this immediate
need what do you think our audience
would do poll I'm gonna say option the
second the second option here which is
because you know I can't spend money you
don't have you got to be fiscally
responsible true do I want to go getting
a bunch of credit card debt or something
$1500 gtx 1070 yeah when the price may
well drop back to normal
anytime anytime or you ever or never
break whatever you know that's a
possibility too but still you know you
just you know you can
yeah you just you're not gonna let them
do that to you I think it's what it
comes down to yeah
so that's why action B is option B cuz
by console I mean that's and that's that
would be my pick out of the three here
if you've already picked the second I
would I would have pick I probably would
have picked the second one to it but I
think the third one is probably and go
for option three I mean because then
you're spending two to four no probably
three to five hundred dollars as opposed
to but two thousand dollars now for like
a mid-range system yeah well I mean it
all depends on what GPU you're willing
to pay for it yeah it sucks because
there used to be some low-end options
and some high-end options that you could
buy at at least MSRP right and now you
can't even really do that
can you by the way I don't even know
this it's probably a stupid question but
can you use keyboard and mouse for the
console exam it has USB ports there the
games are I know there's something with
that but yeah I know there's at least a
product that's an add-on that you can do
it with and I'm not sure about native
support maybe some games are supported
maybe a small list yeah yeah
but yeah it's but it's not the game the
problem that I went from if I recall
correctly from reading about it is that
the game is still looking at it it's
still expecting a choice you know like a
joystick input yeah from a from the
controller so you can have a mouse but
the mouse movement is just simulated
simulating the joystick Oh going so I
guess it's really weird and not natural
Terra's aiming like like yeah so
interesting so there you go huh okay
well you know you know where our votes
lie folks let's see what your yours do
okay here's the results
as reps you were right right Wow
actually more people would would bite
the bullet and pay the crazy prices and
buy a consulate
look 34% of people have are just willing
to just pay money wow this is we
shouldn't let I hope no one from the
industry is watching this because
they're like wow people will pay
whatever whatever price we're willing to
sell it for keep the prices where they
are in fact raise a more be richer and
more powerful than ever oh my goodness
well it's good to know where you guys
stand yeah um looks like yeah looks like
you know everyone has their breaking
point and I think this is it for a lot
of us you're not gonna pay $800 $700 for
a gtx 1070 yeah that you could have
gotten for literally half the price when
it first launched or like a month and a
half ago
yeah like gosh anyone who's like even
though they're the Black Friday prices
aren't that great I'll wait I'll hold
out and damn you're probably regretting
that decision right about now okay hey
all right let's let's you know there's
always a bright side right there's
always a silver lining often when one
buys computer hardware there's this like
immediate letdown afterwards because
something newer and faster comes out
that's cheaper right thank you you know
you just got the new risin and the risin
to comes out or whatever that kind of
thing there here's a situation where
that doesn't happen yeah maybe somebody
just bought a GTX 1070 a month ago and
now like hey this this is now more
valuable than when I first bought it
yeah doesn't doesn't usually happen
that's true computer hardware amen it's
probably probably very select few people
who are like hey yeah yeah let's take
there's one final question yes this is a
very simple straightforward question is
I want to know we both want to know are
you guys watching this currently on
YouTube twitch or both and we're not
we're not allowed to include it forth
option there just like neither but but
if they're gonna answer the straw poll
now they're just watching us in person
windows that one looks pretty covered up
but could be some webcams
that's just creepy and I'm a little
creeped out cuz you guys you guys would
do something like that Tim all right
don't look at the we can't look at the I
can't look at how many people are
watching that's true on YouTube although
although it just hit one 337 on YouTube
that's pretty that's pretty awesome but
at the same time we don't know how many
people are watching us on Twitch
currently have an open the tab we've had
the chat open pop out so let's move
let's head back let's move back to our
our second question and try to figure
that out people's opinions your guys
thoughts on how Intel's been handling
the whole meltdown and specter fix so
far either good bad or you don't care I
guess we'll just you will use the AMD
one even though it's not fully accurate
because as Paul mentioned I did include
Spector there we'll just consider that
as like the doesn't really I don't
really have an indifferent well use that
as the indifferent option so I'll go
first this time since Paul at first last
time yeah and I'm gonna say there's been
so much reporting on Intel messing
things up and not handling this smoothly
that I think it's probably the common
consensus now that their response has
been complete noted garbage and this is
a total train wreck Intel how could you
do this to us it's a bold choice not
only bold choice not only did you score
slightly unexpected I had to go with my
gut so I I will go with the AMD user
here so so shrug okay because I think
they're doing the best they can way to
go Intel is probably not gonna fare too
well as an option here so I'm aiming for
second place okay let's take a look here
if I can get my silver medal there we go
Wow okay look at that 35
% AMD users yep I bet that's a growing
number for various reasons this one
being yeah maybes part part of it yeah
their their response really hasn't been
all that great we're gonna get more into
that a little bit right you have
something to talk about on the air yes
yes I think that's pretty expected yeah
it seems like they have been focusing
more on like choosing the right the the
very carefully chosen words that they
can say to talk about it that makes it
seem like less of a crisis or an issue
that it actually is right but kind of
downplaying the issue yeah right this
versus being like wow this is a problem
we're gonna do everything possible we
can to fix things and make things right
right like you know that's yes I think
that's what people are looking for and
that's not what they're here yep but uh
we'll talk more about that in a minute
yep finally are you watching us how
aren't you watching a twitch or porno I
mean both we're not on Poron don't even
look
don't even try looking don't even type
in our names or anything like that when
you won't you promise you won't find us
so I don't lose viewers too part of else
I mean problem alright you can go for
this next one Paul and bear in mind
people and Paul that for every wrong
answer we get we have to take a large
swig of whatever beers in our cup all
right now neither of us have beers I
know at the end of at the end of at the
final end of the segment all of the all
the punishments will be carry out rest
assured we'll be okay
okay something look forward to yep no
baby oil no baby I'm gonna say I'm gonna
sit Emma choose the neutral option and
why not both because maybe people dude I
mean unless you're on a data unless your
data capture something then that makes
less sense but maybe people are watching
us
streaming both and then you can switch
between the chats and stuff yeah that's
there's so many benefits
that I wonder if anyone watches this on
both at the same time what the stream is
just playing it slightly different
delays just we're just talking over each
other just like a really bad I go I
wonder if someone watches both at the
same time but thinks then the audio is
actually like the audio from Pink Floyd
the wall and it syncs up kind of you
know kind of syncs up yeah yeah like how
it syncs up with The Wizard of Oz yeah
if you played The Wizard of Oz yeah
especially when you're like tripping on
master or something as a friend once
told me this is ksham a grand reserve
hail Jame is a fantastic beer that's
brewed by Travis monks it doesn't try to
kill you in in Norway know where I saw
some monks when I was a diesel yesterday
in Austin Texas I want one the cute
father Theodore from the abbey hallowed
be thy name from the Abbey yeah from the
Downton Abbey Abbey Abbey is a bunch of
looks like a nun nun hangout spot right
hmm there's a bee where a bunch of nuns
hang out is that what unhappy is down
Downton Abbey
down down Neffe that's its TV show yeah
I know I that's that's about as much as
I know about Abby's is that there was
once a TV show that had the word in its
name hey I gotta get this open carefully
slowly yes what's your choice here is
Twitter YouTube that's the other reason
why I told you and to force you to
choose what I know now I know that's why
I'm having difficulty here I'm gonna say
YouTube though PTSD every time a nice
the kicker though
I was Vegas and back oh that's the woman
you brought to Vegas nice has not always
kept it
okay
I feel like had we stayed had I stayed
in the same hotel as you you would not
have come back home from Vegas with so
much bigger problem I would have helped
you destroy I really didn't all that
there was not that much drinking for
this particular job I failed you
see next year we have to stay at the
same hotel yeah that definitely needs to
happen I just think the MGM was almost
fully booked by the time I finally got
around to booking honestly it wasn't it
wasn't really worth it I thought it was
somewhat convenient but did you take the
tram to the convention center much I
never even went to the convention
centers yeah yeah I went there once to
meet up with gamers Nexus and I was
there for about an hour then I went back
to the hotel yes that was the only time
I went to the show for and I'm trying
just distribute this evenly you're very
challenging mm-hmm it better be matched
to the to the millimeter it's pretty
close it is I think that is within
millimeter distance millimeter height
milliliter milliliter yeah okay sure
all right we got beer okay let's let's
take a look I said YouTube because you
know I started on YouTube and I guess I
there's some bias there but I love you
both out which I love you don't hate me
all right let's see what the results are
twig master-race of dominates oh my god
Wow and no no one watching them both
apparently I had absolutely the wrong
response to Twitter I have to see though
which kind of big this is interesting
coming up big ten because it's
impressive actually it doesn't even show
that we're streaming here okay it's
weird though because we have eight
hundred and eighty two people watching
us on Twitch right now and 1,400 people
almost doubling almost 1500 people
watching us on YouTube yeah
the twitch is just completely dominating
the the polls so maybe maybe YouTube's
just lazy though YouTube viewers got to
step it up I see voting voting it is
important people your vote counts and
now it's so important and now you lost
this very important political it's like
one that's more well over a third of the
twitch viewers went and voted too and
that's not even counting the people's -
I mean there it deserve people there too
so I'm impressed all around Mitch I'm
gonna drink because it's wrong you drink
tubes too large gulps and I'll have one
for the one I got wrong it's still good
oh it's delicious right
oh it's so good it almost has like a
grape flavor like a grape aftertaste
which I like grape you say and you can
see all the little bits a little bit the
floating bits
yeah the flowing bits that's where the
flavor comes from mm-hmm this is also 9%
so something to that's something to keep
in mind there absolutely all right thank
you very much for singing with us for
ask the audience that will conclude that
segment good job everybody
Gil did a great job answering polls and
stuff but next up we get to move on to
pit my PC everything again interacting
with you guys a bit to see how just not
terrible you guys are at PC building yep
Paul and I will point out your every
flaw tell you how you screwed up in your
life's a mess but youtube links aren't
working for the straw poll that's what
they said okay yeah whatever
what's done is done I'm sure I'm sure
there'll be a recount
you know once it's theirs maybe maybe
cell is like a closet twitch master race
and he gave them broken links to he gave
broken links to youtube so that they
couldn't vote on the poll which is why
twitch one that would suggest that cell
is like some shadowy figure behind the
scenes pulling the strings in ways that
people couldn't possibly understand in
order to manipulate their very opinions
of things his level of knowledge and
power does
intimidate me everyone everyone be be on
your best behavior himself he will
you'll destroy you
he will rip you a new asshole with his
penis
he's a tender lover
[Laughter]
all right Wyatt why why Pelle
why all right Wyatt yeah maybe 700 K the
gtx 1080i them both of those things are
worth a lot yeah especially the TI a
Maximus Hero 10 Wi-Fi X 62 frakkin
g.skill 16 gigs
Drakken love that case okay yeah sorry I
had a birthday give me a minute all
right
um what I didn't realize that they made
the pro-am in white did you then the
interior did he paint that what did he
paint that interior the nd pro-am
doesn't have a special edition oh it's a
special edition yes Wow but that looks
beautiful I love it
I haven't seen that one I missed it
somehow but um looks like you've got
really good cable management you know
it's good when really the only cables
that stand out to you at first glance
are the ATX and PCIe
yeah everything else has tucked away
beautifully granted the empty program
also has great cable management for that
but you've utilized every every grommet
and cut out appropriately love those RGB
fans those l-series fans from Corsair
must have costed you more than more than
the case nice ISA van egative space with
the framing of the picture that dude yep
yeah so very very very clean have you
spotted it yet Paul spotted putting my
spotting have you spotted it yet
oh oh that's an awesome was the best
case ever there's a there's awesome
hardware and bit with logos on the say
there are oh my gosh right look at that
yeah that's super awesome yes yeah we
should see more of us that's the best
you guys should do that more
nice makes me happy this is the best
build that's ever I know I don't think
we've ever seen a more glorious system
here unfit my pc I was gonna say some
cable extensions mighta top things off
but it's like no take it back no it's
this it's an ideal build don't change a
thing yep yep perfect build we shouldn't
even talk about the rest of the builds
no I don't wish everything might be seen
you're all terrible compared to whites
but then well then sir yep now every
similar to pander con Brian Brian
Beauchamp Brad super tower he calls it
Kevin will take core w200 the super
mikro x10 sra and until Xeon e3 1620 b3
at 3.5 gigahertz three two gigs of Super
Micro ECC memory and we've got an AMD
risin 1700 x4 gigahertz MSI x3 7000
tinium Zin it is this a doesn't does not
compute wait what oh it's it's a it's a
flip system there's a dual sister like
the two systems one on either side
oh okay actually so many ex-pirate okay
okay alright this is it this is a
business business up front party in the
back is what I want to say early yeah so
on one side of this case is this a case
labs case it's got wheels so it might be
there's the core w200 is that that's the
Thermaltake case right yeah yeah
thermaltake case yeah that's what it is
it's one of the Thermaltake cases that
yes sorry looks very skip that it's a
very nice liquid-cooled system going on
here interesting
what's a mullet PC mullet is per
business up front party in the back
ah that's what ya got ya matter who's
the boo boo no boo foo there's an
acronym for that I was forgetting never
mind
all right so whatever what do we have to
say here okay let's look at the the nice
side first looking at the nice clean
sight okay looks like you've got some
ptg chewing in here yeah some hard line
bends that you know are functional yeah
they're not they're not bad overall
alright they're not like they're not
like wow it looks super amazingly clean
the main thing we're time talking about
here is gonna be just your angles yeah
you have one very distinct angle from
the tube sorry when I mouse over it it's
it's doing that I know I hate them so
much but I think nothing Paul's right
parallelism is your friend when it comes
to tubing to bending yeah and the more
parallel or perpendicular even that your
tubes look that I think overall the
cleaner looks yeah so or if you have an
angle try to repeat that angle with some
other build so that it becomes a theme
yeah your little your little loop that
is right over here going between the two
graphics cards feels a little awkward to
me there's other ways of doing that I
mean I can I can see that like adding
additional tubing because you know
sometimes it's just like hey I'm doing a
liquid-cooled bill and I don't want to
just do a direct connection from one
gene bank to another
yeah add a bit of flair or something
like that sure I just I don't know it's
that's cuz it's going off to the side
like I don't know yeah it does seem it's
it's not exactly it's not exactly there
for me yeah I I could see you know going
through here the next time you're you're
gonna flush the system and clean it out
and you know maybe maybe retry on a
couple bends just to see what you could
do that but yeah that's just being picky
overall really nice awesome looking
build their ends I mean I like that
you've got a super microserver board
with the xeon build on the on the flip
side of it and over there it just looks
horrible
with just cables everywhere and you're
like you don't care and it's like it
doesn't matter cuz it's like no one no
one sees that there knows it's there
because really all they see is the is
the pretty sight it's pretty sad on the
other side so so there it is yeah geez
anything to add cap um I would say cable
management but still so yeah well yeah I
mean obviously obviously all the
standard critiques would apply with the
flip side system here like you could
totally clean up all the cable
management there how does key management
work in this case when there's a system
on either side yeah I mean you have to
be creative with it or write or work
with the space that's behind all the
trace for the hard drives are yeah yeah
cuz obviously that's that's a that's a
mess that's a horrible mess right there
it's gnarly but um anyway nice very very
nice unique build a brand I'm sure it
works just fine
yes good job Brian thank you much very
much for your uh submitting that next
thing we've got Dan mr. Dan with horizon
1600 16 gigs of DDR 4 and an Rx 588
gigabyte model inside of what looks to
be the case that is a budget looking
case yeah yeah I thought it might be
brands here on these clasps but yeah
just a DD for optical drive yeah all
right so your case just strikes me as a
very budget case yeah might be the
weakest link here um to be honest your
CPU and GPU are great you've got a 500
gig SSD in there he says he's got two
terabytes of SSDs um two terabyte hard
drive look she followed up with this
picture
okay so he's got some airflow what's he
trying to tell us with this picture by
the way I have an optical drive I have a
fan underneath my dental drive what's a
fan all right so this Oh some additional
is that a mod yeah I mean he positioned
that in there I don't know whether it's
just set in there but either he's got it
fixed in there zoom it might be oh yeah
I'm just this melody modded that is to
send old did he get an old optical drive
that's what I'm thinking yeah to mount
the face
yes that way he could actually mount it
into the optical drive bay and then also
mount a fan to the to the drive itself I
applaud the creativity there it all new
interesting it all needs to be cleaned
yeah like your systems try been used for
a while I got some dust buildup and
whatever lots of herbs in there such a
small budget case - yeah a man drives -
uphill drag three hard drives a new case
with some better Cale management's that
has maybe a more aesthetically appealing
set of harddrive cages like right cuz
there's cases that have hard drive
setups that you can put a bunch of
drives in and bring I don't know
something about the the dry this the
edge of the drive sticking out with a
bunch of safety cables yeah get
something like that great getting into
evolve or like a get the new fractal
define our six the fantastic that has
the hello drive cages in that drive
trays and they're hidden and they're
hidden yeah so and then ice little whoa
I think yeah everything else looks great
though that's a perfect the perfect
balance between CPU and GPU your cooler
is on point you know it's it's just
enough for for the risin 1600 no problem
storage looks great the power supply is
fine
I mean I'd remove the power supply
sticker but everything else is good one
thing I'll say just from a component
standpoint is if you could afford to get
I mean now is probably a bad time but if
you happen to land on a really good deal
for some higher speed ddr4 since you are
ruck and risin I'll try to hit you know
29:33 80,000 megahertz or you can
overclock if you haven't overclocked
that Ram third skew 75 inch at pointed
out it seems to be on the floor sir it
does it does appear to be on the floor
and I think that makes a lot of sense I
will I will heavily criticize that
computer shouldn't be on the floor
other than that though everything Kyle
said good job yep thanks Dan
Thank You Carlos Jaime Carlos with the

turbot and that one terabyte per J okay
ketchup and mustard I see it we get the
single picture what a picture here yeah
oh right oh you've got a mult no wait is
that a adapter it looks like you've got
oh a single yeah single 8 pin just 2 6
pin adapter yeah he's using the adapter
oh that looks I haven't seen one of
those in a while
it's possible that that's not even there
it looks like it might be a 6 pin there
hold on
what I need to zoom and enhance zooming
enhance no 8 pin bra no look at the
white the white plug oh hey can you do
that zoom again a 6 pin yes yeah 8 pin
they're all since they're all the same
connections the same rail as long as
you're not pulling too much amperage can
that deliver what can that there's
enough praising praising gauge wire
there's a certain amount of wattage that
can be drawn across it before the wire
gets too hot and starts to melt the
housing and that kind of thing that's
where there's more connections those are
see at risk at all it probably they're
probably not with the GTX 1060
he's probably just fine or was it a 960
even oh yeah it's a 960 I think ok it's
probably this probably ok yeah but this
I think that's a 6-pin connector plugged
into an 8 pin adapter what's crazy said
he has a thousand watt power supply yeah
which you would think would have that
plug why do you need an adapter on it a
cooler master silent Pro 1000 watt so
that's very strange there's a very
strange choice later what what did you
do with those other cables sir sir
Carlos um
questions for you and why why even have
a thousand watt power
so Carlos you he doesn't want parts why
should really have connectors to plug in
directly to those without using it maybe
he bought it used on Craigslist for like
50 bucks and that was the thing with the
modular cables who knows that's a
possibility but anyway but yeah
some replacement cables something like
that swap does that would be a very yeah
good idea and responsible beyond that
you know you got a clean-looking build
your cable management looks good your
power supply you know some extensions
would clean things up a little bit when
it comes to your cabling there you've
got some sag on the GPU big-time
that you know there's a couple options
with potential ways to fix that but may
or may not be something that bothers you
beyond that you know nice nice clean
looking built if you end up fixing the
power supply issue and you upgrade your
graphics card and whatever and you're
still looking for something else to do
the hyper 212 is something that is an
excellent value and entry-level cooler
but at some point you start it start
starts looking not going as nice as the
rest of the components and yeah like
that definitely also does he not have
fans at the front they might be and can
they be on the other side of that if
they could but it would pretty much
restrict all airflow huh so if you have
fans underneath your front panel I would
suggest highly suggest putting them on
the inside of your case yeah behind the
dust filter not in front of it yeah a
big good idea yeah okay all right final

f gaming motherboard and EVGA supernova
650 80 plus gold 650 watt power supply
we
all right so nice nice build yeah it is
with the lights on
the only real triggering thing to me
here is that the fans are mismatched on
your radiator that that bothers me but
the OCD in these so you got like like my
brains like that's perfectly fine but my
by my heart I hurt her your heart hurts
I don't know I I have a stickler about
the fans matching especially when
they're on the same radiator I mean come
on it looks it looks so clean when
they're all the same fans no it's
because it's - and - yeah I think I'm
just really I mean just like it would
look very uniform you know if every fan
in this case were those Corsair maglevs
oh it would be perfecto oh yeah all
right having so having the same exact
fan throughout the case would would look
a little bit nicer yeah but I don't -
ray this doesn't bother me that much
okay it's almost like like I wish I
don't want this one get bigger he
wouldn't bother me so much if they
weren't so different like the fan frames
are so like they're the most different
and contrast days you could possibly get
between two fans those those maglevs are
extremely stylized and it just it just
looks they clashed to me I'm picturing
like a big way
did you ever did you ever try when you
were a kid right did you ever draw a gun
like you try to draw like you know like
yeah cool gun yeah and then just it was
you would just make it bigger and bigger
right they'd just be getting on
there like a section here and then like
a another part of then part of the
barrel and then like another you know
yeah yeah and so that's that's what this
kind of rides it's like different pieces
together I don't know yeah I mean
honestly it's it's fine
it's not like I'd look at it cancer I'm
just saying like okay it's such an
already clean looking build I have to
nitpick something that's the thing that
I go to so that's
that's what you're going to it is very
clean I mean it's hard to really
pinpoint anything else on this system I
mean even like the the stock PSU cables
that you're using look decent like
you've routed them well you've utilized
all the right grommets and stuff and in
the this empty case here or no isn't
that the case it's fantasy
it's eclipse oh great this is an eclipse
p400 maybe he didn't say from the front
panel it looks like it might be at
eclipse p400 but it's definitely fantex
at any rate um I'm digging it I mean
maybe the wiring could be a little
tighter coming off of your your CPU
block the water block but it's obviously
not bad at all it looks really good you
even have like a nice fantex
LED strip on power supply shroud and I
have no other no other questions your
honor
okay good looks great that's my maan
good job blaze hey listen to me those
fans hurry are we doing for yourself we
can skip it
since rarity that way we've already been
going for a while now yeah let's let's
get on to the news and see how we are
that okay all right move along with some
tech news I told you guys we would
circle back to the hole Intel's response
to the meltdown fix sorry sorry babe the
meltdown exploit you did say that so
here we are specifically this articles
from TechCrunch and they're just kind of
talking about Linus Torvalds response to
the way Intel's been handling the
situation so far basically the last
revolves is a very experienced fairly
well known coder when it comes to Linux
systems so he's pretty well respected in
that he's kind of the father of Linux as
Paul mentions and he is pretty enraged
by how Intel
has handled the situation so far he's
been exchanging emails between himself
and David Woodhouse who's an engineer at
Amazon in the UK and among the email
responses
Torvalds claims that the patches and I
this is a quote the patches are complete
and utter garbage and also has anybody
talked to them and told them they are
effing insane he didn't say that he said
 I said are they insane
that's why we have the warning that's
why that's why I said the word in
front of the K IDs yeah he also argues
that the so-called security fix that
didn't tell recently rolled out a couple
weeks ago was implemented poorly and
essentially does nothing while also
introducing redundant fixes that
Google's Project zero has already sort
of implemented themselves the fix I
actually haven't installed the fix or
updated to the fix yet so I definitely
any of the windows patches I haven't
experienced own any of the hardware BIOS
patch the hardware BIOS patches that's
because that's what he's what he's
pissed about yeah - - pissed about the
BIOS patch is Intel responding to this
in a way that doesn't treat it as
something like the it's talking about
the the pre boot environment when when
you're starting up a computer yeah and
the way that in there's basically
there's they're setting a flag so you
have a bit that can be in a 1 or 0
position and that's a the the bit is in
the position that says this CPU is
compromised and fixable or this and and
and should it be and should you
implement the fix right so if they flip
it then the implements fix so what he's
accusing them of is doing a half-ass fix
that still allows vulnerability because
it's something that can be turned off
and it's because in a lot of the
situations
they implement the fix because of how
its effects branch prediction which is
one of the ways that Intel CPUs became
very fast is by by like it it's doing a
series of calculations it knows as a
good chance that it might that you might
do a B or C so it just goes ahead and
figures out what the results of a B and
C are right you're gonna choose a so you
choose a and you go down that path that
figured out B and C it discarded those
so that basically when you take away its
ability to do that because inherently in
that function there's is where the
vulnerability lies when you take away
its ability to do that depending on what
you're doing and specifically in server
scenarios it hurts the performance
significantly as much as 20% which is a
huge drop-off and I think in the article
it references lift was it lift to
actually reference after they did their
server updates they saw something like a
20% performance hit or something oh wow
I didn't see that it might not be in
this number something else but yeah it
depends on the situation if you're a
home user and you're just doing typical
day-to-day stuff on a home PC and
playing video games that kind of thing
it's not gonna affect you that much it's
not gonna hurt your performance that
much yeah there have been some people
Hardware unboxed has done a decent
amount of testing so far there's
probably gonna be more testing going on
to actually see like does this affect
gaming performance and that kind of
thing yeah it's it's been fairly minimal
in that respect but a lot of this has to
do with how it's gonna impact people who
are run server farms yeah thing right
cuz that's where you that's where a 20%
drop off in performance is like
devastated yeah devastating yeah that's
the right work big-time so I mean yeah
you know Torvalds is also asking why
this this implementation has been
installed at such a low level I guess if
if Intel's claiming that feature
processors won't won't actually need it
that you know it's just this generation
of CPUs and the ones
for it that are affected there shouldn't
be such a low level addition here and
he's also saying that their technique
Intel's technique is so inefficient that
a universal rollout would cause
widespread slowdowns and so instead
Intel's made the main meltdown fix
optional and added the redundant stuff
to make the patch look more
comprehensive so Intel's basically
saying like what he thinks is that intel
is trying to buff up the appearance of
their fix to be more than what it is by
throwing in a bunch of redundant fixes
so to speak that aren't really necessary
and that they're not really actually
attacking the the heart of the issue so
it seems like for now and I think Intel
like maybe a day ago admitted that their
their fix was was crap right they made
some sort of public statement saying yes
their public statements are very like
everything is so like you know wait like
they they passed every email and
communication through like eight
different PR people at different levels
to have them make sure that the language
was so precise and yet ineffectual right
and it's completes yeah that can I think
so so yeah they're basically they
admitted and warned that some of the
micro code updates that have been
distributed through motherboard
manufacturers so the BIOS update update
CPU maker code to fix the CPU to make it
not to basically remove the bug that
makes it vulnerable to meltdown for
example those have been causing
instability blue screens that kind of
thing and did you get the sense that in
that public statement Intel's kind of
throwing them other board vendors under
the bus I thought they're like we urge
all motherboard manufacturers to
thoroughly test early versions of the
fix before releasing them I was like
yeah I'm sure fix like it's not like you
should have thoroughly tested it before
you give it to them yeah
so like the fake Mars like it seems like
that seemed like they were sort of
pointing blame a little bit yeah trying
to nothing I've seen ferment Elvis has
like accepted full responsibility right
or use the right language so it
indicates that they're treating this
with the proper level of seriousness
that it deserves
yeah based on the amount of
vulnerability that's been introduced
yeah exactly and that's that's sort of
like why linus torvalds is is kind of
like you know he's a controversial
character at this point because in one
regard he's very he could be written off
as like this loudmouth Menace who's just
you know way to trigger and it needs to
calm the F down or an Intel whatever
he's kind of known for his rants he is
super known for that but he's also known
to like he's able to do the rants cuz he
actually knows what the hell he's
talking that's the other thing is that
at the same time he could be looked at
he's being looked at as like sort of
this unsung hero that that knows his
 well enough better than any of us
do but better than most of us do to look
at the code that Intel's putting out
there and saying this is all wrong and
and I guess if you're the only person or
one of the few people who knows
something that everyone else doesn't you
kind of have to be loud-mouthed about it
otherwise you kind of just get drowned
out by all the other voices who don't
really know what they're saying so in a
sense it's like it's kind of good and
that's sort of what the author's in this
article from mm-hmm from TechCrunch is
saying is that - as as crazy as he
sounds I mean he's at least sort of
helping us in a way he's ensuring that
we don't get screwed over in this whole
process and that Intel's actually doing
the best they can to resolve the issue
and you know and he knows he can receive
the code and it's like he has a third
eye whatever that we don't so he's kind
of an antihero was blind
oh then and then he made a band and
named it after his third blind eyes I
don't know
those things they immediately regretted
after saying it fun it's good segue Paul
to our next article which is from a
technics about NZXT this is a really
quick one NZXT lowering the price of
their new n7 is e 370 motherboard which
I kind of saw this coming
NZXT was out of all the vendors that we
saw at CES NZXT was probably the one we
least expected to show off a new
motherboard in fact it was their very
first the n7 on the Z 370 platform for
intel core cpus 8th gen and yeah it got
pretty good feedback based on the sort
of feature set and the all of the the
cam integration hue + + green +
integration that people a lot of people
are fans of and also the look I think
it's a very unique style it's it's just
good to see something different at the
end of the day whether you like the
style or not I'm glad that there's it's
of innovation in that front on that
front but it was 299 dollars which was
hundred dollars and they first told me
that price I was like oh this this could
have been like a board that sold well
kind of thing or it's like if you're
selling it for $300 especially when
there's like gigabyte in a season as
Drock who are selling boards that have
similar feature sets granted without the
NZXT stuff for half the price um most
gamers aren't gonna go for that
so they've listened to fan feedback so
far and they've cut it down 50 bucks to
249 which i think is still steeper than
most gamers would want to afford for
mainstream until I feel like most people
looking in the 150 to $200 range maybe
low 200s yeah 250 to 300 is starting to
push it hng and there it's like it's
just like this only so much a
motherboard can do for you when it comes
to connectivity and features and that
kind of thing exactly you know it's long
as it's got decent power delivery it's
not gonna make your CPU that much faster
and
yeah so it's hard to say like look spend
your extra fifty to a hundred dollars
here mm-hmm
versus like Oh spend your extra $5,200
getting you know the next tier up of CPU
that has you know hyper threading
instead of not hyper threading or or you
know getting more memory or getting the
next tier up of graphics card just stuff
that you can more tangibly say will will
help you during art and what you're
doing with your computer yeah so and I
think it's it's an interesting product
because NZXT is a very well known
reputable brand but the motherboard
partner that they're working with for
this board is ECS who's kind of an
underdog in the whole motherboard market
I mean they they're not really known for
being like one of the big dogs hasn't be
I hadn't heard that really know then the
sweet they're like they're like we're
not trying to hide anything we're we're
working with ECS on this and so that's
the bare-bones componentry is it's a
nice ES board at heart and ECS boards
you know they're the con amore I feel
like on like the sort of entry-level
side of things but I feel like because
NZXT swooped in and and slap down their
own Flair they're like we can totally
they probably like had this you know
they could they had definitely had a
conversation with VCS or they're like
look we can we can sell your boards for
like double the price because we're
slapping our name on a type of thing
which is fine as long as you're giving a
fair amount of features but I don't know
I just don't know if if selling the
entire NZXT ecosystem is gonna warrant a
hundred and fifty extra dollars to the
price for most people like easiest I
think they're not as they don't have as
good of a reputation in the US I'm not
sure I think they do they do a decent
amount of business in China and I'm not
sure as far as the larger Asian market
or that kind of thing but like for me
it's like alright NZXT if that's a brand
that I know a little bit better than ECS
maybe I haven't heard of ECS before then
maybe the
the Eckstein name makes me trust it a
little bit more and a little bit more
possible that I might invest in this
compared to like other options I've
heard of like aces or gigabyte or
something like that but what are you
getting with this board this competitive
at the two hundred and fifty dollar
price right right like that's icy icy
surface mount of power and reset are you
getting the next-gen USB 3.1 connector
they don't have that on it's not on
there are you getting is there a debug
LED on here there is but it's under one
of the em top two slot covers what it's
under this slot I don't know why they
did that there you have to remove it in
order to see it it's like right here on
the left side I thought I was like
that's a weird place or it's hard about
that cuz debug LEDs on the only way they
irritate me is when they can't turn them
off like that one I think I guess you
could yeah as like the time I'd like
disable that one right at the same time
you can instantly know that Arctic
Panther yeah it's running perfectly fine
just at a glance oh yeah at a glance
mother it says hey a judge Jesus okay
but yeah it's it's gotta be competitive
you know and there's only so much a
motherboard can do I guess so right yeah
but but but if the thought is ECS plus
NZXT
seven letters combine them together and
it's Nessus looks like a CSX or mines z
spellin S&amp;amp;S
music necessary on your notepad or
something it looks horrified
that's why you're not in marketing hey
here's the point I'm trying to make them
yep
if NZXT through branding and maybe a
look and feel update can help
ECS sell their hundred and fifty dollar
motherboard for a hundred and fifty
dollars
I'm okay with that mm-hmm if NZXT plus
EC s and this fancy plastic cover that
they put on here makes them think that
they can sell hundred and fifty mother
one hundred and fifty dollar motherboard
for $250 that I think is stupid or at
least should be called out like actually
hey you're paying more money for this
for the looks or whatever yeah you're
getting it I can't say if that's the
case or not but that's that's I think
I'd be mapping I think the most
compelling thing for me about this board
is if you were just decided if you're
decided that you're gonna get a you plus
because this has a built-in oh yeah hue
plus is 150 bucks ish I think the last
time I checked it's about 50 so now with
a new price reduction this is the one
area I can justify it in it's like okay
it looks cool and it looks different
than any board that I want does it metal
is it a metal cover it's a full metal
shroud its mouth shroud I thought was
plastic it's totally metal did you see
it did you go to NZXT XD okay yeah it's
full metal and and the board has a lot
of heft ooh it feels very like heavy and
stuff and sturdy not even Asus has like
the I think that even they use plastic
on there they're tough series boards so
very high quality I mean I got to test
it out and stuff just sort of feeling it
is nice quality but I was gonna say is
if you were just decided that you're
gonna get a Houston anyway it's 50 bucks
right there and if you're really digging
into the style the sort of aesthetic
here and they even have like swappable
heat sinks like the vrm heat sink and
the chips that heat sink those can be
swapped out for different colors that
they sell separately and stuff if you're
really jiving if you're diggin the
aesthetics and you're you're you know
you're gonna get a huge
that's that's my strongest argument for
this board I think okay because you're
still not getting you know there's a
couple of the things that it's missing
but if you're getting those two things
if you're into those two things then
technically it's like a two hundred
dollar board right then it's like then
that's like you're paying $200 for the
board and you're getting the hue plus
thrown in right you're gonna you're
gonna buy a hue plus anyway and you're
saving space in your in your system from
not having to have that thick two and a
half inch but super thick module I'm
sorry I don't think applause oh it's
really thick thank you but you guys let
us know what you think in the chat let's
move on to our next story hope I hope
NZXT does well with this board because
if they don't they probably won't
release any other reports will be like
let's just canvass and never do this
again
I I hope that they learn from it and get
better I'd like to see more options in
the motherboard space I feel like we do
somebody build so often that it's like
there isn't gigabyte board Asus board
it's all the same after a certain
point so variety is good but moving on
here talk about some more variety when
it comes to your Radeon FRX Vega 56
laterals what a segue that was a oh I
like it uh sapphire according to WCC of
tech is planning their new or plan to
release their new rx making it 56 pulse
oh you mean this story yes okay sorry I
don't know it's fine you are they can do
what the the the the RX Vega 56 pulse is
expected to hit store shelves next month
in February this was spotted in the wild
by video cards calm yeah they do
it's 970 us really okay so it's the
article says 789 euro which I converted
to 970 us but that is the current price
that it's set to okay what refreshing
honesty
um which which is kind of confusing to
me because if this hasn't really reached
many retailers yet I I thought I was
told by the internet who would never lie
to me
that the GPU prices that we aren't
determined by the manufacturer but by
the retailers right right
I have you heard that it's something GPU
maybe it's up the GPU adding board
partners faults the in third they're not
in control whatsoever of the prices it's
all the retailer's it's Newegg and
Amazon it's those guys who are setting
these prices but this hasn't even hit
the retailers yet and they're already
quoting is 789 euro or nine hundred and
seventy US dollar price tag so really
are the retailers the ones that are in
control of the pricing I don't know this
that seems like it seems like sapphires
has something to do with this or at
least AMD I don't know it's crazy though
$1,000 for a card that was close to
retail for what four hundred five
hundred the air cooled out of your
finger I'm so confused
I think three ninety-nine if we if we
100 maybe their works air cooled they
get fifty six is supposed to be three
ninety-nine yeah and and now it's it's
more than doubled yeah
holy moly holy moly
you didn't get a third fan dual dual fan
cooler I mean it looks nice fine sure it
looks fine does it look at thousand
dollars nice I gotta be I got a no I
gotta be honest for $1,000 that would
expect more than a plastic shroud but
give me some metal in there or a
thousand dollars I have it expects more
than that's a weird backplate crappy
plastic I'm just gonna be super super
critical of all graphics cards yeah
you're expecting me to pay $1,000 for
this plastic piece of what the
is wrong with you are you kidding me
these look at this look at this aluminum
fins these are aluminum these should be
gold-plated for $1000 with at least gold
on there
that make it more 6-millimeter heat pipe
come on my god and why are the PCI he
puts in the middle of the card I don't
like you when they do that that's a very
that's what case manager makes grommets
that that accommodate middle positioned
or power supply our GPU outlets oh yeah
it's right here
it's bigger the PCB only goes out half
the card look at this you're paying me
I'm paying $1,000 $1,000 get half a PCB
that's no exceed its garbage crap it's
trash that's disappointing disappointing
anyway I'm gonna be reaching out to
sapphire for a sample yeah I'd love to
get one of these anytime you guys want
to do business no no Furillo like I
guess that that's what we should
probably do now great if we're if
they're gonna charge double all right it
has to be reviewed accordingly for
$1,000 in the past what have you gotten
for $1,000 in the past a Titan X right
yeah a Titan X you say the metal arm
this graphics card should be spray
painted black I will accept nothing less
than spray painted black metal like they
do with the Titan X yeah it makes it
look really cool I kind of feel sorry
for sapphire here because you know that
they've been in development with this
product well before the insane price
hike of GPUs like they're probably like
hoping to get this in at a more
competitive price like you know what
Vega 56 was going for before CES and
then right when they were about to
announce it like hey guys by the way
yeah GP prices have pretty much doubled
all across the board I mean but that's
that's what shouldn't they shouldn't
they're probably hoping to sell a lot
more at half the price it doesn't matter
if they're all selling they're only
charging they are they're all they're
only charging nine hundred and seventy
dollars if people are buying them for
nine hundred and seventy dollars that's
it that's that's how it works they would
not announce that price as the MSRP
unless the cards are moving at that
price cards ten 70s wouldn't be selling
for what they're selling right now on
eBay and there's no stuff if people
weren't paying for that people are
buying these cards for this amount of
money this is all right this is a great
news are they're not gamers this is
everybody they're probably not gamers
doing it there's you happily a much
smaller percentage of gamers doing that
versus people who are buying the cards
thinking like I'm gonna get this in mind
the cryptocurrency I'll make it back Oh
obviously gonna be worth a hundred
thousand dollars so also idiots buying
these cards thinking they're gonna mind
Bitcoin for some reason that's yeah okay
did you not get a mind bitcoin you can
find all my coins all Bitcoin mine here
Emily is done by ASIC farms because
bitcoin was taken over by ASIC farming
back in 2014
2013 whatever it's all coins and other
stuff like that's has been been
supported but anyway are you mining do
you how do you know intricacies err why
not mining I've never mind
I have no Bitcoin wallet I own no
bitcoins I don't know cryptocurrency at
all what's all that information for for
someone who doesn't mind I mean I try to
follow I make six videos in distress I
guess it's not true some idea of what's
going on with the hardware whatever
people are chatter getting suspicious
mmm-hmm no mining rig behind it there's
a widespread conspiracy that I have like
a big farm of mining a big mining farm
going on anyway
alright well ok can't wait for a
sapphire is crazy overpriced graphics
card to come out yeah who even cares at
this point that is even
matter um let's talk about something
that's probably a little bit more
affordable which is a motherboard
gigabyte and asrock specifically have
launched their Gemini Lake Gemini the
board's first Gemini Lake motherboards
to hit the market this is from hexxus
thanks hexxus these two motherboard
manufacturers have launched motherboards
on this platform with pre-installed
pre-installed Intel Pentium silver and
Celeron CPUs so this is pretty pretty
bare-bones like entry level
alright lower end stuff but still all
three boards seem to only be fitting
with quad-core processors model number
j4 105 which is a Celeron chip that can
go the kantor bow up to 2.5 gigahertz
but gigabyte is saying that it's jnt
series boards will offer the option for
the latest Intel Pentium silver chips as
well so what the wait for that all the
board's arfamis so the CPU CPU can see
is being topped with a passive heatsink
it's a very small low profile aluminum
heatsink so completely silent in that in
that regard also kind of gives us an
indication that these are fairly low
powered CPUs but they are capable of
delivering some 4k video playback
according to the article which would
make great Intel HD HD PC or something
like that until its page for these as
products formerly Gemini leaked what do
they have like a lake change no it's cos
in so it's a code name it's not their
shipping name so even though we can
easily identify all of the products in
this family by saying Jim and I lake
according to Intel now that the product
is lunch
Jim and I like we can't say that anymore
it's a code name until so corporate
formally firmly Gemini it's kind of
sickening tenia moose silver Jay five
thousand five penny of silver and five
thousand
Celeron J 4105 these are all quad cores
and dual cores that came out at the very
end of 2017 all the 1.12 to gear
gigahertz range and they're pretty much
all being used and little SOC
environments which you might we saw
though tech actually demoed some of
they're really really teeny tiny
computers based on the platforms yep
these will be available in pre-built
including the busybox minis from from
ZOTAC and intermix yeah you guys can go
ahead and check it out all I'm gonna
read off all the spec sheet because
we're short on time but those are coming
soon let's go ahead and read off mommy
be home I've ever read out some
donations comments here so good Lord is
your rifle Oh dogs are just getting
excited for nothing they just decided
they'd come down here oh you can murder
someone naked oh he's alright starting
with Scott Dilbeck our first dinner of
evening scattered cheers dope shirt Kyle
when I thank you oh yeah I do like this
shirt Paul how you like in the truck a
few months in and how are the puppies uh
I'm enjoying the truck it's good to have
a truck puppies are good as you can hear
they're loud and and and exuberance and
everything hmm and yeah I gotta get I
gotta do a verification on the truck
tomorrow ooh you go to CHP validate my
California plates nice beautiful um I
see you in chat Kyle you look like
Dominic Cooper you watch the preacher no
I do not but I've been told that I look
like that person before and I hardly
know who that person is but apparently
it's true because more than one person
said it okay people don't lie
also bazinga X $10 love the skit you and
your wife did about gpus so was she
really a minor minor when you started
dating oh yeah yes
he's referencing the sketch that I did
on GPU mining earlier today you can go
ahead and check that on the channel it's
live now um no she was not a minor minor
when
started dating but she was not 21 when
we started dating and I was so it was
weird because I feel like oh I like I
planned the date for us plow we're gonna
go to this cool bar and then we're gonna
go to lousy police she'd be like I
remember I'm not I'm not what he wanted
like so yeah there was that without her
it and then I just went I just left her
at home and it all worked out
leave your dates at home people it's the
best way to get close to them
Matt Grimes $10 Callum Paul the paint on
your glasses suck paint one trip through
the washing machine it's almost gone
otherwise love the show on YouTube what
no no no no that shouldn't be the case
I've watched these a thousand times and
it's a fine like these are holding up
phenomenally well this is the motive set
that I got I think over a year ago
yeah there's and you use a dishwater
this doesn't come off I don't know I
don't let you use a dishwasher we
actually don't have a dishwasher you
don't have dishwasher but I've heard
from lots people who have dishwashers it
doesn't come off yeah so mad I don't
know where you're using these things are
super high quality yeah like I mine are
completely perfect from like basically
since the day I got them so I don't know
maybe double check your washing your not
here your dishwasher settings make sure
it's not on like molten lava or
something yeah like like steel wool or
steel wool um if you're very if you if
you're actually legitimately concerned
maybe email our merch best guide John
and maybe he'll have because he knows
more about the actual printing process
and screening process than we do so
maybe he'll have some tips or something
as to how to best care and maintain the
the decals and stuff so look at that but
thank you very much for the donation
unless Matt Grimes
$10 Kyle Paul the paint no II that's
those the same things Matt that's Matt
again
Zachary Hummel $20 watching awesome
hardware drinking beer and to bending
for my new my new dual loop great way to
spend a tuesday night that sounds
awesome
does that sounds like good luck a lot of
my tuesday night bending zack if i
we're doing the show bend those tubes
pup Shepherd $10 when I lose YouTube
partner February 20th because I only get
24 2400 hours a year and only have six
hundred and thirty three subscribers
will I still be able to schedule videos
also mail time mug mug mug yes I'm
getting around of the mug I meant to go
today but wifey sauce I forgot to tell
her to go to the freakin post office and
get that stuff for me
but soon um Wow YouTube's shutting your
channel down because you only get 2400
hours of watch time a year we're gonna
talk about the YouTube Partner have
dates on my half yeah I hope we do see
silly that's 2400 hours it seems like a
lot of hours to me so um well yeah year
per year yeah I guess TV chop baby for
the $5 I got to my official honorable
discharge oh you got an honorable
discharge that's good that's the way
better than this this one's got my other
official honorable discharge paperwork
from Uncle Sam
uncle same uncle Sinkin suck my abhi you
can say that no he didn't see through
that threw that in for dramatic effect
if that hits the fan and the dress
happened I just going to ref in better'n
what does that mean it's a language that
you learn when you become a veteran I
don't know I don't know I have no draft
is required yeah at all the near future
you know with Trump you never know who
would be the last person to have the
right
to initiate the draft anyway um
honorable discharge I don't know if
that's good news or bad news that sons
that's fine sons Bad's means he's being
discharged from the Army and
dishonorable so what's honorable means
it doesn't have to be in the and the
environment yeah at least it wasn't a
dishonorable discharge those are the bad
ones yeah it's a good job on being
discharged honorably good tap Davey
you're an honorable person the--my thank
you very much for donating em b67
whatup 13.3 seven donated the perfect
amount you should all donate elite
amount as well
I have nothing important to say other
than I really like your $10,000 really
build Cheers well Cheers
cheers to you I like it too I'm actually
gonna start using it full-time starting
tomorrow exactly very excited to use
those types of things right Dean go on
my 40 put $5 superjet I have mixed
feelings about that but I do appreciate
the enthusiasm thank you very much Dean
go pack rice $5 hello love your videos I
twitted twitted a twit of you guys about
getting my I 380 100 to work on H 110
motherboard don't know if you saw it or
not to tell me you think an a380 102
work h1 h1 10 H 110 is Z 270
watered-down it's it's I know I know but
it's like there's a 100 series mother
came out during z170 yeah okay so it
came out with scaling so is that a thing
have you been hearing reports oh yeah
they're there been a few you know that
platform getting coffee like to work on
old motherboards they've been a couple
of those here and there that I've seen
and they're somewhat interesting it's
it's not it's it's not supported so yeah
there's always lots of quirks and
weirdness with it and that kind of thing
so right I guess it's good if you
but hey if you got it to work and it's
working and it's stable for you then
that's good very good job buy a new
motherboard and you saved us a ton of
time not having to swap that out in your
system
yeah because swapping out the
motherboard is the worst thing to do leo
el primo $15 built my first PC mid
December with your help
could've done without you guys thank you
you're welcome
1600 Rison v 1600 with the gtx to 1070
strix beautiful card in the mesh fic
beautiful case is it wise to exhaust up
with two fans and intake with one rear
and two front I think you're fine that's
not like an overwhelming amount of
positive or negative pressure either way
so thumbs sounds almost neutral to me
you should be alright
also the mr. feisty has good dust
filtration so no worries there I think
you're good to go beautiful system thank
you very much for the donation sir
Guido salducci for the five dollars is
there a power link adapter for the asus
strix
a 8g 1070 TI I'm interested in diverting
the power cables to the sides and back
power link is that power VGA our link is
an EVGA adapter yeah and it's pretty
flexible you can take the little plugs
inside it and then screw and move them
around and whatever it to be compatible
with different cards I'm not sure with
that specific asus strix card if there's
a different or unique placement of the
power connectors like the Sapphire card
we were looking at that had the the two
that are were right in the middle of the
card would not work with that so if if
they're in a pretty standard location at
the edge of the card then it would
probably be okay because the power link
is pretty adjustable but um it might
need to look up that card specifically -
yeah figure that out indeed thank you
very much
Zane winter $5 it's sad when the
value GPU is the Titan XP and prebuilt
is the best option right now interesting
fascinating confusing times that we're
in right now I I'll have to agree with
you there jujubee's 13 dollars and 37
cents once again the magic number I keep
catching you guys late Happy New Year's
happy New Year to you to teach peace
glad you're here
mark Gomes always films Allah's not guns
Allah's poems always with an M $5 no
comment thank you Mark
you hit it monkey fart 81 $5 hey I'm
currently conflicted should I buy my
friends 10/10 atti or should I keep my
ten seventy because I want to keep
mining a theory or as he put it l 3m
plus might be a typo there l3 I'm unless
it's some new no coin I'm not aware of I
don't know it depends on how much your
friends selling is 1080i for I will say
that if you're paying your own
electricity the 1080i is far less power
efficient when mining than the ten
seventy from a bit of research that I
did so if you like not having a
outrageous power bill I would say keep
the ten seventy kachou bruh the warlock
$5 got a new a ocg 2 4 6 0 PF 24-inch
gaming monitor free sink full HD 1920 by
1080 TN panel 144 hertz
one millisecond height adjustable
display port HDMI USB I can say oh my
god
congratulations congratulations
you sound so nice you said appropriately
excited about your brand new monitor
which getting a new monitor is is pretty
freakin amazing I will say especially
something like that Congrats servants of
tech $5.00 where would I submit my 4 pin
IP see if I don't use Twitter Facebook
may be always looking for more ideas on
aesthetics at this time servants of tech
I am only accepting submissions on the
Twitter's so maybe consider getting
yourself just some Twitter
account that you only use prepare for
Pitt my PC people have done it before it
seems to work for them plus guy gets a
nice kickback from Twitter
I'm making it Twitter exclusive haha I
wish member shirtz Heather Hansen hey
it's my wife why the sauce everyone $5
hi honey here's a little something for
you and your date night with Paul
tonight
so have fun well I think my wife's
coming to go be a priest that's okay
sorry you were invited Lisa Simpson
thanks honey appreciate it oh it's our
five dollars coming back to me oh yeah
best q3 $5 love the show guys my PCs
disc runs at 100% on Windows 10 for the
first few minutes of being turned on
despite a complete wipe of the OS any
ideas
when you initially turn on your computer
it's pretty normal for it to do system
startup things which might involve a lot
of disk access mm-hmm so I wouldn't be
too worried about that as long as it
settles down and it's not always 100%
disk activity you probably okay yeah
first first few minutes I mean yeah just
Windows 10 going in there taking all
your personal information sending it
back to Microsoft yeah you know it's
pretty much I'll stake every date of
mine's to be expected to my name is be
mining some nerd named Steve $5 hey this
may seem like a stupid question but what
with the bottleneck with the 1080 TI sli
setup and a thread Ripper 1950 XP you'd
be looking at the yeah there's a if you
look strictly at instructions for clock
and gaming scenarios with Intel versus
AMD right now and Zen architecture
versus what they were using with coffee
like there's about a 7% difference all
things considered
so only in situations where your CPU
limited will your CPU actually
potentially cause your 1080 TI to
perform not quite as good as it might if
it were impaired with like an
overclocked 8700 K for example yeah but
it's not that much it's pretty minimal
so I wouldn't be too concerned about it
you have a really nice keep you and I
really nice
and unless you're playing all your games
at 1080 you probably not going to
encounter that CPU limited situation
very often if at all all right I agree
with everything you said
mmm boys in media we said media $5 does
my vagina know but does my amiga amiga
ever that has ever that totally
incorrectly
does my Amiga 4,000 with Video Toaster
have enough cuda cores to run destiny to
also I need a 24 pin serial connector to
my monitor what's an Amiga 4000 with
Video Toaster is old its old things
failed old ass ah this is this is a
really it's a really old computer um
okay um probably not you probably can't
run destiny - nope yes you would need a
24 pin serial connector for your monitor
you probably should get a new computer
and any monitor computers old updated
your old you're an old person Tyler
black $5 what would you consider high
temperatures at idle for an i5 4690k at
4.5 gigahertz on average fan speeds if
your fixed at 4.5 gigahertz you're not
doing adaptive offset or anything like
that and you're idling I would say 50s I
mean probably in the 50s 1440 to 15 40
to 50 would be fine anything beyond that
is a little concerning okay let's say
you hit 65 as long as you're only
hitting like 65 like 1 2 percent of the
time it's fine if it's just a random
spike all CPUs do that but if it's
constantly like 65 66 65 66 69 60 to 61
66 then I would say check yourself but
if you are using adaptive a frequency
and everything which you should be
because it makes a lot more sense as far
as power savings then your your idle
shouldn't matter your overclock
shouldn't if they
idle speed cuz you're idling it should
be running it is reversible bass
frequency yep so you should be idling it
you know 28c may be little 30s is what I
would expect
yeah pretty much and that is pretty much
it for the donations for this half of
the show which means we can quickly
shout out some Johnston's um let me get
those up for y'all real work
