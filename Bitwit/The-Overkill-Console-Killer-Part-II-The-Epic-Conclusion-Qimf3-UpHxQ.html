what's up guys welcome to part 2 of the
console over killer series in case you
missed part 1 where I discuss the
components and assemble the full system
you can check it out
somewhere on the screen but in this
video we'll be going over the
performance benchmarks to see if this PC
is worthy of its audacious title before
we dive right into it though those of
you who have already watched part 1 know
that not everything about the build
process went according to plan so let's
first talk about what transpired since
then before wrapping everything up with
some very telling benchmarks to briefly
recap the 24-pin ATX cable from the
Silverstone SFX power supply was too
short to route behind the motherboard
tray resulting in some seriously
unattractive cable management well
shortly after posting part one I went
rummaging through my collection of
computer stuff and found an unused 24
pin sleeved extension cable from
silverstone befittingly enough which was
immediately then used to redeem the
computers striking aesthetic the other
problem I ran into during the build was
that my initial decision to use the
shadow rock LP had been squandered due
to the RAM clearance issues with my
g.skill sniper modules forcing me to use
the noisy stock cooler instead rather
than buying a new cooler or a new memory
kit with shorter heat spreaders I
swapped out the sniper dims with the
Crucial Ballistix kit from my HTPC
they're super low-profile allowed me to
install the shadow rock without a hitch
thus granting me a bit more overclocking
Headroom on the Athlon chip which I was
then able to take to a stable 40 500
megahertz while the system has already
seen its fair share of complications I'm
glad that everything seemed to come
together in the long run and I'm
incredibly happy with the end result but
now that the build is optimally
functional and is right where I want it
to be in the looks department what's
there to say about performance and
doesn't measure up to the spec of
modern-day consoles well clearly the r9
280 destroys the integrated graphics
found on current gen console ap use so
my only hint of concern here was the $75
860 K potential
holding us back in certain cpu driven
titles but if the cpu can hold its own
we're talking about a far superior
gaming experience that's achievable for
around the same price as a console if
you're still skeptical about the pricing
statement you clearly haven't seen part
one yet and you should feel bad on that
note with the question of console killer
looming over our heads let's put this
debate to rest once and for all
with some benchmarks starting off with
Metro last light we saw an average of 46
frames per second on high settings at
1920 by 1080 though the game's PC
exclusivity makes it tough to compare
these results to those of a console the
fact that this is one of the more
graphically demanding games of its time
already queues us into the system's
potential at 1080 we were able to crank
the settings all the way up to ultra and
BioShock Infinite and still get a solid
79 frames per second interestingly
enough the third installment of the IP
never launched on current gen consoles
making its debut only on the ps3 and
xbox 360 both platforms ran the game
natively at 720 at 30 frames per second
well it certainly be unfair to compare
the performance of a modern-day PC to
that of a ten-year-old console it's also
relevant to note that even the slightly
faster ps4 is still running triple-a
titles at 1080 60 frames per second at
medium to low quality GTA 5 is the first
game in our tests that's been released
on all three major platforms running at
1080 and 30 frames per second on the ps4
we were able to hit 46 frames per second
on average at the same resolution with a
nice blend of quality settings since
these results were much lower than I
anticipated I decided to pop the r9 280
into my x99 system fire up GTA 5 with
the same settings and marveled at the
performance gain 274 frames per second
indicating a sizeable CPU bottleneck for
our app on CPU there was an unexpected
silver lining however since the console
over killer wasn't maxing out the cards
potential I was able to turn the
resolution up to 2560 by 1440 with no
performance loss the higher resolution
made the game look super crispy while
compensating for the lack of any
anti-aliasing overall a bittersweet
discovery in my testing to say the least
since competitive first person shooters
generally favor higher frame rates the
ps4 sacrifices some pixels to meet that
sick
the FPS standard however the console
over killer blows us out of the water
scoring 82 frames per second on high
settings seeing is how we land in way
beyond the 60 FPS mark I was curious to
see how he'd fare in 1440 and much to
our delight the testing demonstrated a
smooth gaming experience at 57 fps and
finally the last game I ran was evolved
where we saw huge gains over the ps4 at
51 frames per second at high settings
textures in the environment are pretty
to look at and character models still
retain plenty of detail offering a fluid
gameplay all the while so there you guys
have it all in all this is a solid
little AMD system that if you're willing
to put the initial time investment into
can really be a great solution if you're
looking for a console alternative but
let me know in the comments what you
think about this build the benchmarks
and whether or not you feel the same way
and also before I sign off I think
there's one more thing from part one
that I haven't addressed yet ah yes the
wall mounting yeah you didn't think I
forgot did you well here's a good look
at it and all of its glory hovering
above my second desk area now all I got
to do is find some nice wireless gaming
peripherals and I'll be good to go but
perhaps I'll save that for another video
