channel hope you're all doing well today
I am presenting to you from wifey sauces
desk for once nice change of scenery for
no apparent reason
but today we're actually taking a look
at the long awaited h7 quad lumi from
cryo rig this is a successor of sorts to
their existing tried-and-true h7 which
is a amazing price to performance cooler
for not too much money but this sort of
builds upon that in every way possible
not just from an aesthetic standpoint
but the RGB treatment but also
functionality wise there's a bit more
that's been engineered into this apart
from aesthetics so we're going to be
taking a look at all that today first
off it pretty much maintains the same
aesthetic when when it's not powered on
other than the the logo on the top here
of it says cryo rig instead of the old
logo and then you've also got the LED
fan which is mono white it's not RGB
which is kind of disappointing I was
really expecting it to be and sort of
hoping that it would be but it's just
whites at the 1600 rpm fan
it's got looks like it's got some rubber
stoppers in between it and the heatsink
so it's going to reduce some noise and
vibration as well and it does feature a
braided cable in black which is nice for
pen PWM at the end and then there's
another cable here which is actually a
USB 2 header on the end of it and that's
for your RGB LED header and cryo rig is
actually worked in collaboration with
NZXT to implement this controller so
that the LED elements on this cooler can
actually be controlled seamlessly in
NZXT S cam software it's the same
software that's used to control things
like the hue plus controller in the
Kraken line of a io coolers the AR fans
and so forth for one you get the light
up cryo rig logo on the front here on
the top based on the top plate and then
there's also a lighting bar underneath
so you get some under glow with your
cooler which I'm assuming is going to
look pretty cool once it's all powered
on and those are independent lighting
zones you can configure them completely
independent from each other which is
pretty sweet gives you some additional
customizability there but the heat sink
itself is more or less identical the
same sort of heatsink design that we've
seen on the original h7 is continued on
here however the heat pipe system has
been upgraded so there's actually an
additional heat pipe now giving you a
total of four six millimeter copper heat
pipes which is pretty sweet and you can
see if there's sort
positioned a bit more central to the
full copper nickel plated baseplate
which theoretically gives you additional
heat dissipation actually it's being
advertised that the quad Lumi here
offers 15% more heat dissipation and
that essentially gives you 20%
I'm sorry 20 watts more of TVP at your
disposal so we're going from 140 to 160
watts so theoretically this cooler
should be able to handle higher chips
and perhaps even give you some
additional overclocking Headroom the
other great thing about the quad loonie
over the original age seven is that it
comes with a lot more support for
various sockets right out of the box so
in addition to LGA 1151 you also get
support for LGA 2011 which does have the
same heatsink mounting mounting
mechanism as LGA 2066 the new h EDT
platform from intel so this should
theoretically mount to that just fine as
well and of course you get a m4 support
out of the box so you don't have to buy
an add-on bracket or order one
separately it just comes natively
supported which is pretty cool so on
that note let's go ahead and fire this
bad boy up and play around with some
lighting profiles and also see what kind
of temps we get on our CPU
oh yeah look at that look at that it's
all installed in the RGB build which was
December specie of the month no less if
it's just super well in this system of
course because it's already got a hue
plus in there some air fans etc uh-huh
yeah it looks good mounting this sucker
was pretty straightforward it probably
would have been a little easier had I
been mounting it outside of the chassis
with just a motherboard but since I had
you know some other components in the
way it took a little bit longer but for
the most part very simple and
straightforward instructions easy
mounting solution I really like the fact
that after you're done installing the
mounting bracket at least for LGA 1151
you only need two screws to bolt down on
the cooler itself you can see one of
them right there if you guys remember
this build it's rockin a skylake core i5
6600 k overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz at
1.4 --is-- volts their doubts and
actually this cooler has no problems
handling if we did GTA 5 for about 50
minutes or so as per usual and we didn't
see temps go over 69 actually so we were
pretty much hovering in the 50s 90% of
the time with occasional Peaks into the
60s ambient in my room during my test
was sixteen Artois twenty-five degrees
Celsius and overall some really nice
temperatures here from the quad Lumi so
very excited about that again I don't
know if I mentioned the $60.00 u.s. so
there is a price premium about fifteen
twenty dollars over the original h7 but
in my opinion worth every penny but we
still have more to talk about here for
starters let's talk about the fan while
it was doing that excellent job of
cooling our 6600 K the fan stayed
relatively quiet I couldn't honestly
hear it over the other case fans in the
chassis and it didn't seem to ramp up or
down to aggressively so that was nice
again I wish it was RGB just because at
this point in the game 2017 if you have
a device that has one RGB LED on it all
of the LEDs should be RGB I think that's
just sort of standard these days so
maybe for a 2.0 model of the quad Lumi
we could see that happen but overall
looks very nice indeed
the LEDs the RGB LEDs on this cooler
however are fantastic super high quality
they look just on par with the LED
strips of the hue plus I might add in
terms of just the color vibrancy and
brightness
I really like the under go lighting here
more than I thought I would simply
because it sort of illuminates the just
all around your CPU socket and it kind
of creates like just a nice glow of the
background of your chassis which usually
doesn't get much attention and it sort
of just creates like a nice perspective
of depth in your chassis gives you a bit
more spatial presence if that makes
sense so it looks really nice the cry
rig logo of course looks awesome too now
I can see why they went with the lungs
longer like spelled out cryo rig instead
of just the shorter logo because it
gives you more LEDs action so that's fun
now I must confess there was a not so
great experience with this cooler in
regards to the faceplate here the
plastic faceplate that just attaches to
the heatsink via four small plastic tabs
they're really tiny little plastic
latches that actually insert into a
couple holes in the heatsink itself and
two of those latches broke off in the
midst of me trying to mount this cooler
to the motherboard with what I would not
consider any sort of excessive force and
the thing here is I don't know if this
is a final retail version I got this
straight from cryo rig at their Computex
booth long before the launch so I don't
know if they're going to be using the
same sort of design and same same
plastic tabs but in the event that they
are and you buy one of these just be
very careful with the space plate don't
try to remove it and replace it if you
don't need to and if you do just be very
careful because they can be sensitive
and do have a tendency at least with
this model to snap off you can see right
here I've actually used resorted to
using a piece of duct tape to hold this
plate in position because without it the
remaining two plastic latches on the
bottom aren't enough to hold this is
cooler in place in its current
orientation it'll just sort of
drawbridge down and fall off altogether
which is obviously not not very ideal so
something to be aware of it's kind of
unfortunate that that's the case but I
feel like me addressing this and bring
it to your attention is going to help
you guys avoid any sort of issue or
damage with this front plate should you
be purchasing one of these in the future
so there you have it now one thing I
almost forgot to mention about this
cooler is that while it does a great job
of keeping thermals in check it doesn't
necessarily take up a ton of room to do
so so what you have here is excellent
ram compatibility you can see we've
already got some tried NZ RGB modules in
here from g-scale sitting pretty with
tons of clearance to spare and I feel
like even in a mini ITX chassis or a
mini ITX board you'd have just tons of
clearance in most scenarios
with a relatively modest height of
around 145 millimeters I can also fit in
a wide variety of cases just height wise
there's a lot of clearance there even in
some mini ITX towers that should be able
to fit just fine if that's the direction
that you're headed for your next build
I guess the last thing to talk about
here is the coolers integration with the
NZXT cam software and how that all works
out so first off I think it's great I
think it's great that you can control
this within cam and you have to have a
separate software I already mentioned
this you can do independent controls
between the logo and underglow and you
can also synchronize your your quad
looming to the other cam supported
devices such as your AR fans your LED
strips and this more or less works for
example it works beautifully with the
sort of rainbow spectrum that we have
worked out right now however there are a
couple effects that don't sync up quite
as nicely between all the various
components for example like pulsing and
breathing is way faster on the quad Lumi
than it is on the AR fans or the LED
strips even when you enable sync mode
the the speed interval is just way off
for those various effects which is going
to bother some and others not at all so
it's just a personal preference it kind
of gets under my skin a little bit when
I click sync I expect everything to be
in perfect unison but you know that's
just me so I'm to be aware of though and
then the other thing is that you can do
some other cool things with with the
LEDs here on the cooler very much like
you can with the other q+ devices we've
seen in the past for example you can
have the colors change based on CPU
temperature or frame rates
I think CPU temperature makes a bit more
sense IMO so you can have it go from
like you know blue to purple to red as
the heat as the temperature on your CPU
increases gradually so that's pretty
cool
it still doesn't smoothly transition
from color to color that would be nice
we're still getting that sort of just
jump around effects jumping from one
color to another abruptly hopefully in
the future that they can smooth that out
as well it might look a little nicer but
I think those are all the things right
and gentleman holy crap I'm so glad I
finally got to take a look at this
cooler I feel like all the hype
surrounding it has now been validated in
my eyes now having worked with it for a
bit and not only does it look great
obviously but it's a fantastic performer
as well as long as you're not trying to
hit some record breaking overclock it's
going to be great for any overclocked
gaming chip under load
it really is a solid component and it
doesn't necessarily replace the original
h7 I feel like the h7 still has its own
place because it is again 15 to 20 bucks
cheaper than this sucker here so if
you're just trying to save some dough
and you don't really care about that
added bling factor with the RGB lighting
then just go with the original h7 it's
still a great price to performance unit
but that being said definitely consider
this guy if you're trying to get that
extra electricity into your system and
you want to go the air cooling route but
that's going to do it for now guys let
