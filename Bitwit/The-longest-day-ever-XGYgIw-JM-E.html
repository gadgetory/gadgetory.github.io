line of all-in-one liquid coolers from
fractal design it's easy to stay cool
click on the link in the description for

a shot I don't take the coffee in tears

Taiwan's coffee game must be weak or
something because a peanut M&amp;amp;M
dissapoint boy did you miss me did you
miss my foot kiss my foot so it is 5:30
a.m. right now this is the morning after
wifey sauce and I have returned from
Computex oh we're still incredibly
jet-lagged we both woke up at 3 and this
morning could not go back to sleep our
brains are just wired because we're
still in Taiwan time obviously so we're
headed to breakfast right now actually
the place doesn't even open for another
25 minutes and I think we just rolled up
for the most part so we'll be those will
be those people waiting out in front of
line like Kelly for eggs and bacon there
it is
Scottie's what's the sushi place opens
and can we get sushi yeah if they open
it like 6 a.m. if it's like a really
weird our sushi place breakfast sushi
come on breakfast sushi oh sweet people
in there I see em movin or coming for

me like which one of y'all go by the
name of Skye enough good service after
that though I always put them on the
bottom oh the business that way they get
softer a little bit oh goodness
thank you yeah I got a breakfast
quesadilla with chorizo Heather got Fiji
I built her own
hmm sounds good
mine's better - Teresa wins Oh what is
this I see clover honey Heather feels
very strongly about the bees how bees
are endangered and we shouldn't be
eating honey because it's killing off
the bees isn't that right honey isn't
this a pretty buzz worthy topic what
kind of human being are you
if you eat honey and support this type
of but I mean just the fact that this
was served with your meal just the fact
that this was certain ice just the fact
this was served with your meal though
it's got to sting a little
right okay let's see what time is it now
646 not even 7 a.m. yet so what do we do
let's go let's go buy a drone we buy a
drone somewhere so it's probably been a
good six months since I really really
wanted the drone I think I'm going to
pull the trigger on right now I don't
know just after the last few trips that
I've gone on Taiwan and Hawaii just
before that the whole time in my mind I
was just thinking it'd be great to get
some like nice you know landscape
footage and stuff some aerial shots of
these awesome places that I get to visit
so I'm finally going to do it some that
by the Mavic Pro from DJI a very popular
portable drone I'm getting the bundle
pack has a few extra batteries carrying
case things like that essentials that
I'll probably use for $1,300
pretty steep however I'm writing it off
as a business expense because I do plan
to shoot some some potential vlog
footage in the future with the drone
maybe you'll see some of it later today
if I can actually get it today all right
let's do this place order they're going
back another way back oh god why do I do
that if I hit back right now will it no
no no no 30 it's done I bought it I feel
great going to flip it but overall
excited I guess we can pick it up later
today at the new a will call which is
only about a 10 15 minute drive from
where we live so as soon as I get the
email from Newegg then we'll head over
there and maybe I get to play around
with it from stage video wow you know
what I think we should do right now
honey we should build a chair what do
you think what do you think about that
I will take that as a definite maybe so
if you guys have been watching my copy
text coverage that I've been posting
over the last week or two you probably
noticed that one of my main sponsors for
the event was verdict year which apart
from being a sponsor they've also sent
me their trigger 350 gaming chair for
review of course you guys can expect a
full unbiased review sometime in the
very near future so far I've heard
really good things about this chair from
other tech reviewers so I'm pretty
excited to put it together also if it's
the right size we might consider
swapping out wifey sauces current chair
which is like a cheapo you know one that
we got from Staples not too long ago
it's already falling apart like the
staples are sticking out so that's
actually not very safe either so we
might just be replacing her chair you
know after the review hole all done and
stuff with with this one which I'm kind
of jealous of honestly if it's too
comfortable then it's going in my room
and you you can I don't know just just
get stabbed by the staples you'll
develop a callus or something alright
let's put this thing together alright
guys so literally this chair took us
about 45 seconds to a minute to assemble
like there was hardly any assembly
required the the backrest has already
attached to the seats the arm rests were
already intact really the only thing I
had to do is connect or attach the
wheels to the base pop the rod in there
and then slap the rest of the chair unit
on top and that's pretty much it and it
was super easy so I think wifey you want
to go ahead and sit in the chair give it
a first go give it a whirl you know this
chair actually looks a lot like your old
chair except this one's like $200 and
this is probably around triple price
maybe I'll do that incorporate that sort
of comparison in my review guys let me
know what you think about that but I
think well the cat already tried sitting
in it we kicked him off because he's
hairy and will probably destroy the
out of it no cats allowed but good
jumper to give it's looking pretty good
so far can't wait to do the full review
in other news it is about noon o'clock
and I just got an email from Newegg
saying that my Mavic Pro is ready for
pickup at the will call center want to
go want to go honey can we go can we go
now please please please please please
please please have fun with your new toy
why'd you get
I fly this thing alright so it's been
about four hours since I picked up the
drone and the batteries are all charged
I got three in total I got the fly more
combo pack so it came with two
additional batteries giving me three in
total with a multi charger and things
like that as well as this nice little
carrying case which is awesome it's
really really high-quality and it also
just gives you a good idea of how small
the Mavic really is of course the DJI
spark which recently came out is much
smaller than this but still I mean this
thematic has the ability to fold all of
its legs so that it really just boils
down to like the size of a water bottle
more or less you can just see it's about
as this whole bag with three batteries
and the drone itself with the controller
maybe a few accessories as well is about
equal to the size of my head the point
of this is that the Maverick Pro is
super portable and can pretty much be
taken anywhere you go which is pretty
sweet
we're heading to a nearby park right now
which has a pretty nice little lake as
well as some mountains nearby so it
should be a pretty good area for us to
try out the drone for the first time
I
why if you saw says I need to shave what
do you guys think I think I'm good just
part of my part of my charm is looking
like I have pubes on my face from ten
years ago triggering Heather in three
two one
you are so annoying
toldja don't question i told you don't
ever touch don't ever touch her Totoro
well let me see it a camera I move your
fingers I'm just going to Kevin how come
you get to molest him with your whole
hand so we're going to go get beer now
no why why because we're healthy
you're changing your tune now you don't
want wine
how did that happen you wanted wine like
three seconds ago
hail that's brewed with time goes with
any feast tastes so mighty fine much
better than wine beverages with yeast
that one never tried this before but you
know it's cheap just like me
I'm sorry I just want I don't mean I
don't really want to burger I'm fine
she'll know that even bacon no I mean I
have some leftovers at home it's not
gonna be done right it's a good luck if
you get a few extra fries like if you
get maybe like a medium or something
I'll share with you yeah I want that
give me that
can I get one fruit look shake house
extra onion salt oh my god you can't
have any
I know you want it so bad but you know
what you just can't have it it's going
to be all mine you're playing with some
reverse psychology at me right now it's
not going to work that shake is all mine
here's all your all that is going right
in here that's my stomach
you can't tell okay that's fine
anyway with a large French buy right
thank you oh my God look at it
look at it looks it looks just like a
regular vanilla shake
it's 8:02 p.m. and I'm about to try
Burger King's fruit loop shake for the
very first time Cheers
oh well that is solid
what a fruitful trip that was if this
was a movie right now I would put this
scene on loop are you single because I'd
love to get your serial number thank you
Oh
