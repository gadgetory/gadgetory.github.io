awesomesauce news welcome back to the
channel you're watching part 2 of my new
htpc video series now in part 1 I
discussed all the components of the
build and why I decided to choose those
parts go ahead and check that video out
if you haven't already and this is part
two which is the build where I actually
do some hands-on work and build a system
from the ground up and I think in the
last video I asked you guys what you
want to see as far as execution for the
for this video and it was kind of split
right down the middle unanimously half
of you wanted a time lapse and the other
half of you want a tutorial for the
purpose of this video I've decided to go
with a time-lapse but I will be also
providing some commentary on top of it
just to give you guys an idea of what
worked for me and what didn't
throughout the duration of my build so
with that said that's enough rambling
for me so why don't we get on with it
alright so here we go first step is to
install the CPU and memory sticks no
problem there now it's going to be a
rough build if you have trouble with the
CPU and memory installation
next was just to remove that enclosure
off the chassis get to the innards of
the case taking off that three and a
half inch drive bay that's the last
you'll see of it because there is no
three and a half inch drive in this
system remove the optical drive as well
or the optical cage I should say and the
front bezel first step from here is to
remove that stock fan and replace it
with one of those gel it's like I said
earlier no problem with the fan I
actually really like the fan that it
comes with it's just just a little loud
in comes the gelid came with these
little rubber mounts four rubber mounts
to reduce noise and vibration and I had
a little bit of a rough time getting
them through those tiny holes so I had
these pliers I just pulled them through
work pretty well
voila next up is the power supply fit
like a glove just probably the easiest
part of this of this build just screwed
it in no problem I put the the intake
fan up top because there's ventilation
at the top of the case
and yeah next is the Samuel 17 CPU
heatsink
this thing was a breeze to build with by
the way I just really straight
straightforward easy instructions super
simple mounting design just these two
brackets one on each side and there's
not even any backplate involved you just
kind of thread those four screws there
from the back up top and it just threads
right into the paint sink as you will
soon see hold the thermal paste making
sure not to overdo it
just a ton of clearance with those
ballistic sports games man just like you
do a backflip under there
I just kept fingering the screws I don't
know why I didn't use a screwdriver
sooner I was like yeah I'll just keep
screwing them until they stop and I
eventually got the screwdriver out so
there you go back plate list design and
it looks awesome too now in the second
gelid pretty straightforward I've got
four screws bolt them straight down kind
of contained that sleeved cable around
as well just keep it from you know
flying around inside the case getting
caught on something
pretty
I do next yeah of course install the
motherboard now that everything is
pretty much good to go as far as all the
main components that are installed into
it and the standoffs on the sg0 five are
pre-installed and you actually can't
even remove them which I like can't
really think of a reason why you need to
remove the standoffs just four screws
one on each corner plug it in that
intake fan cleaning up my screws
and going straight for the modular
cables for the power supply making all
the big connections now I could have I
could have I could have plugged in the
front panel connectors first but I guess
the way I saw it was get the big cables
out of the way and then the little
cables can kind of just thread right
through them relatively easily could
could have done it either way I tried to
have that ATX cable go around the fan
like up and over it
so it wasn't blocking it directly I
think I did an okay job cable management
in a case like this is relatively
limited so song change the installing
the front bezel get those front panel
connectors all connected Oh almost
forgot the little tray there little
panel for the optical drive yeah the
front panel is really easy to just
reattach and stuff and take off it's
just a couple of latches couple of tabs
on on three of the sides super easy
quickly forever to find that HD audio
connector is actually a complete
opposite side of where the front panel
connectors are kind of by the PCI
Express slot but the cable reach just
fine any further away though it might
have been in trouble it's kind of hard
to see where everything was like what
was late I couldn't see the labels on
the front panel connectors right there
so I had to bust out submit the manual
do a little bit of tidying up twist
higher to
never a bad idea and for the SSD the two
and a half inch drive is literally right
underneath the optical the optical caddy
it's attached to it you can't detach it
which is totally fine because I'm going
to need a two and half inch drive anyway
slim optical drive tiniest little screws
for that thing kind of scared I was
going to lose I managed and here's where
I realized I don't have a slim SATA
power cable I totally overlooked that
from the start
I just been a while since I built with a
slim optical drive and excuse me I can't
really use this right now but luckily I
can just pick one up either at work if
one lying around or just piling up in
your leg for a couple bucks and it
shouldn't be too bad at least I won't
have to uninstall a bunch of components
to get to the optical drive plug it in
there's a nice look in there that was
nice coming along
we're almost done God do that video card
moving that PCI Express brackets getting
out of that card take that plastic
wrapper off damn you
now this was kind of tricky I couldn't
really see where I was aiming
at this point the case is pretty cramped
and I kind of just had to do it by feel
and at one point you can see I'm pushing
the ATX power cable deeper inside the
case because it was kind of interfering
with the card that helped a little bit
so I slotted it in and even though it
was completely in and mounted correctly
it still was a little misaligned from
that PCI Express bracket but I just kind
of had to nudge it and then screw it in
got the PCI Express cable connected
she's got to remount that bracket that
that card looks really just wicked
inside this case it's like it was meant
for it that's pretty much it I'm adding
that closure open it down oh yeah
presto all right guys I am now done with
the build it's completely finished yay
with the exception of the slim SATA
power cable that I need for the the slim
optical drive and honestly I probably
should have done a test boot a long time
ago like before I I don't know
installed everything so hopefully this
doesn't blow up in my face this is
really the first time I'm booting it up
so wish me luck and hope this toughest
works
we got Howard dancer spinning GP is good
power supply is good I'll rap alright so
look it's a success it seems to be
running I write one third post and I
think I'll any of you now is install
Windows 7 and just start loading up all
of my games and media onto this thing
and and then use it that's the end goal
right so it's pretty much gonna wrap it
up for this this video guys a third
video I will say is projects going to be
performance you know gonna give you guys
temperatures and maybe do some gaming
benchmarks as well let me know if
there's anything else you want me to do
with this system while I have it in a
wall its new and fresh rather than that
I'm I'm gonna go take a shower because I
just I've been sitting in in this chair
this is my stuff and seeing this chair
just sweating on this hot bright light
right above me so I'm gonna do that and
you guys do your thing and subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
thank you all for watching I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
