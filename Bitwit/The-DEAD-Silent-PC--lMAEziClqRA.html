back today we are doing PC of the month
here in October so we're gonna do a
Halloween themed PC not quite as crazy
or eccentric as last year's but it's
still gonna be pretty nice much more of
a practical and sort of a standard build
if you will this is gonna be the dead
silent PC plan words you know cuz dead
relates to dead things like like you see
you on Halloween anyway doesn't matter
it's gonna be a pretty nice high-end
system featuring a lot of modern age
components that you guys should enjoy
and by the way links to all the stuff
can be found in the description below I
should also mention this video is
brought to you by be quiet but let's
let's just go down the line here I'm
going to start from your left and just
go all the way down in no particular
order here we've got the NZXT q2 which
is an amazing lighting system and this
recently came out and I did a review on
it you can check that out later we've
also got an under glow kit and that's
kind of hiding behind here which is also
gonna add just a little bit of something
extra to the finished build there's
gonna be plenty of graphical horsepower
in the system as well we've got a
gigabyte Oris Xtreme r-tx 2080 I
actually have the card there's chilling
behind here this thing is a total beast
it's it's the fattest r-tx card I've
actually seen here in the office so far
and it's got some crazy LED fans that
we're gonna get a closer look at by the
end of this video
moving on here we have the Intel Core i
$9.99 hundred K yes I'm going with the
fastest gaming CPU currently on the
market also maybe one of the most
overpriced CPUs right now but that
doesn't change the fact that it is quite
an animal when you're talking about
gaming and this is first and foremost
going to be a gaming machine
we've also paired that with the asus rog
Maximus 11 hero a fantastic board also
doesn't come cheap but very well
engineered and has all the bells and
whistles you could want in a gaming rig
down below we've got it - Sheba OC z RC
100 nvme m2 SSD it's a little guy it's
only a 22 by 42 I believe but it spec
and V Toshiba Zone in house of BICS and
then flash storage so it's very very
high quality very very reliable drive as
well our memory kit there the T Force
Nighthawk RGB that's 2 by 8 gig sticks
of ddr4 at 3000 speed and the reason why
we're using it in this build today is
because even though it's RGB I don't
know if you can tell in the Box there
but there's actually some orange accents
baked into the actual heats
better so it kind of defeats the purpose
of having RGB lighting in my opinion
unless you're putting it inside of a
black and orange themed PC for example
so I think it'll do just fine although
it might get kind of covered up by this
massive cooler that we have here the
dark rock pro 4 from be quiet this is an
incredible air cooler one of the best on
the market
it's got 250 watt TDP it's got a dual
heatsink design dual fans
I may even remove the outer fan just so
we can get a better look at the heat
sinks on our memory but we'll have to
see how far we get there just below that
we have a big quiet straight power 11
units at 750 watts 80 plus gold
certified fully modular and all that
it's got a silent wings fan built right
in
so it is very very quiet we'll also be
adding three silent wings three fans
into the system these are 140 millimeter
units 1000 rpm PWM incredibly high
quality and and very silent as well
which is exactly what this build calls
for of course and then last but
certainly not least we have to be quiet
silent bass 801 this is the mid tower
chassis supports up to e ATX
motherboards and pretty much any
full-size hardware you can possibly
throw at it it's got 10 millimeter thick
dampening mats for just extreme silence
it has a modular motherboard tray so you
can actually invert the entire layout
internally which I think we're gonna do
today that way we can get a better look
at the the crazy LED fans on this Oris
card I think it's just these two items
together going to be a perfect fit
overall and apart from that you've got
tempered glass a very nice power supply
shroud that actually has a bit more
functionality built into it then than
most PSU shrouds do now one thing you
might have noticed missing from this
table or cables we actually have some
cable mod Pro Series cables on their way
they haven't arrived yet but hopefully
during the build we'll get here and we
can just pop those in at any time
additionally you guys should stay tuned
to the very end of this video where I'll
show you guys how to win a set of be
quiet hardware there will be three lucky
winners literally tripling your chances
of winning so stay tuned for that so
without further ado ladies and gents
let's go ahead and start building this
dead silent PC
he or she is October's PC of the month
looking pretty fly with that inverted
layout obviously flipped motherboards
aren't for everyone I'm a huge fan of
them I always have been and the only
thing here that I could say cosmetically
that sort of bothers me is that I didn't
mount the the CPU cooler 180 degrees
around so being quiet is actually
upside-down which is kind of annoying
the Auris doesn't bother me so much
because there's nothing you can do about
that
but in hindsight I wish I would have
flipped that cooler it's really easy to
do we're just a little pressed for time
right now the other thing about this
cooler is that it's so massive in case
you couldn't tell that it kind of covers
up some of our heat spreaders there and
one of the dims is fully masked off by
the fan here but if you really wanted to
get a better look at your modules you
could remove that fan and you would
still have that second fan in between
those dual heatsink towers and I'm sure
the cooling would be just fine honestly
it's such a massive thin stack
I'm also digging the fact that this is a
fully air-cooled system I feel like
air-cooled rigs don't get enough love
these days we've got three intakes at
the front three more exhausts at the top
and then one more exhaust at the back
all of the fans except for that rear
exhaust are hooked up to the fan
controller that's integrated with the
case and it's got a three step
controller there's also an auto setting
right now we're on the lowest setting on
on one and it is as the title mentions
dead silent it is super quiet even with
the side panel off believe it or not I
actually have Unigine Heaven 4.0 running
on the system right now it's not hooked
up to a monitor but but it is running
it's under load and it is just it's
quiet it's so quiet obviously maybe the
fans might ramp up a little bit once you
put the side panel on because the
temperatures will spike up a bit but for
the most part it is super quiet so I
guess that's the mission complete there
as you can see our cable mod Pro Series
extensions finally arrived and they were
worth the wait
100% they look really nice and kind of
circling back here the last thing I want
to mention is the whole process of
inverting the internal layout in the
silent base 8:01 it was actually a lot
more straightforward and simple then I
thought it would be it was just a matter
of in screwing the nine mounting screws
holding the motherboard tray in the rear
panel in place those two panels are
connected by the way flipping that just
physically turning around remounting
those screws there's a cover here for
the power supply basement that just gets
flipped really easily if you want to
utilize the hard drive cage underneath
the PSU basement that has to come off as
well with like two or three screws very
simple and that's pretty much it within
about five minutes or so you have a
completely inverted internal layout and
it just works very seamlessly very easy
to do so kudos to be quiet for that and
last but certainly not least I'm kicking
off a giveaway with be quiet there will
be three winners each winner will win a
set of be quiet hardware including a
case power supply CPU cooler and a set
of fans it's a pretty nice starter
package if you're building a new system
